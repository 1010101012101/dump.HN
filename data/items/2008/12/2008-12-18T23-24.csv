Total ankle replacements exist now, they just aren't very good.However, I find it highly unlikely that in the next 10 years, incremental improvements to artificial ankles will not lead to ankles capable of jumping, dancing and jogging.",1229644714

This actually made me stop and think:<p>""Dude, I've been here for ONLY 19 years and I've seen so many things change so fast, its mind blowing""<p>Being blessed/cursed with living in Eastern Europe, I probably have witnessed change in a much faster rate than most HN readers from the US or Western Europe, because for the wast 20 years we had to catch up culturally and technologically. Imagine that, when i was 3-4 years old we had a color television which could support 8!! channels and you had to manually tune each one, and there were only 2!! tv stations in Bulgaria at that time(cable was just entering). A year later, we had cable and in another year we had a tv with 39 channels, the cable had 50, but the tuner could only pick up 20-30. two years later we bought a small JVC for the kitchen and it had TELETEXT!!! We could read news and see whats on tonight IN THE TV SET! WOW! I still use it sometimes, but its slow. Today i have youtube, and than is not just a technological change, but a cultural one too, i look forward to the future!",1229644397

402785,comment,402654,402654,0,0,danw,,,"There are plenty of opportunities in the enterprises. They're looking to cut costs and switching to interesting, powerful, cheap apps is one way. As a hacker you'll likely need to team up with a former enterprise insider, possibly someone recently laid off. They'll need to understand what tools are inefficient, what strange requirements enterprises have and how to sell to them. You'll need to price below the ceiling where middle managers can make spending decisions without committee oversight or prepare for long slow sales process.<p>One possible perspective.<p>Producing an ecosystem where normal 'sheeple' workers can be employed outside of the restraint of big companies is another opportunity. After these mass lay-offs people will see that working for one boss who can fire you is bad and that multiple bosses will produce more stability. These workers and the companies that use them will need sources of information[eg <a href=""http://freelanceswitch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freelanceswitch.com/</a>], tools to manage work and workers [basecamp] and ways of communicating with peers and customers[twitter].",1229644335

You can then transfer the call between phones by hitting a button in Newber. This is fine for incoming calls, but what about outgoing calls?

how are you doing recently?
I would like to introduce you a very good company and its website is
www.ele-stores.com. It can offer you all kinds of electronic products
that you may be in need,such as laptops ,gps ,TV LCD,cell
phones,ps3,MP3/4,motorcycles and etc........
You can take some time to have a check ,there must be something
interesting you 'd like to  purchase .
The contact email: elestores@188.com.  MSN: ele-stores@hotmail.com<p>TEL:  0086+13717782599<p>Hope you can enjoy yourself in shopping from that company !<p>Regards<p>They also decided it was a good idea to put that msg into my signature as well as set my account to vacation mode with the same vacation msg.<p>Obviously this was a very brazen thing to do, and they clearly made no effort to cover it up, neither was my password changed. So I figure this is more likely an automated thing, I left my account logged in with a firefox 3 browser at work (university firewall) overnight, which is when this occured. So all signs point to some sort of an automated attack through the browser, does anybody know more about how this happened?",1229642058

As a 6 year php coder and a 2 year cakephp developper, I HIGHLY recommend it.<p>Yes, everyone thinks the docs aren't good. They're currently pretty decent actually. Also, the community is amazing and all of it (core code, docs and community) is just getting better.<p>It's a really good, VERY flexible framework and most important; incredibly portable, which I think is the reason why I love it.. I haven't had a hiccup with it since the latest versions have come out (1.2 RC3?). I've also done ALOT of client work using it, rarely on my on web host. It is the Madlib to rails' Timbaland.<p>That being said, cakephp 1.1 was REALLY bad. I can't stress that enough. This is probably why it gets so much bad press. There's still ALOT of information written on 1.1, alot of technical articles, howtos, etc.. and an upsetting amount of reviews and performance tests based on 1.1 or early beta 1.2 releases.<p>I capitalize ALOT.

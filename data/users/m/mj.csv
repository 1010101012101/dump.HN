Not so much in the sense of strong vs. weak AI, but in the sense of AI as a rich interdisciplinary field rather than a purely technical one, where an important part of the field&#x27;s research is in understanding how to formalize/computationalize vague concepts like &quot;intelligence&quot;. A few AI folks I like in that vein: Marvin Minsky, Robert Abelson, John McCarthy, Allen Newell, Phil Agre, Erik Mueller, Michael Mateas, Ian Horswill, Jaime Carbonell.<p>Some interesting domains: design-support and design-automation systems, generative art, computer music, videogame possibility spaces, procedural architecture.

mjrbrennan,39,"I’m Martin Brennan, and I’m a full stack software engineer based in Brisbane, Australia. I primarily enjoy working with C# and Ruby, both with .NET and Ruby on Rails respectively, but I’m always seeking ways to expand my knowledge and learn about new tools, languages and frameworks. I blog at http://www.martin-brennan.com. You can contact me via email at mjrbrennan@gmail.com or hit me up on twitter @mjrbrennandev! You can also check out my GitHub at https://www.github.com/martin-brennan.<p>In addition to software development, my other loves include reading, writing, music, fine liquors, and my lovely fiancé Sabrina and our little boy Patrick!",1421121429,1453165186

Java is great, and the JVM is especially cool, but I think it's a bad place to start CS education. I saw this C++ to Java transition happen firsthand at a university and compared to before, students developed handicaps on the IDE and had a much harder time grasping concepts like memory management. (Saying you will never write a memory manager in the workplace is irrelevant; it's a learning exercise just like writing quicksort). Also, Java doesn't cover lambas or recursion any better than C++. Part of the fallout that I witnessed was due to bad planning, since  later courses expected students to have knowledge that they never picked up in the new intro course. I guess ultimately it just comes down to the student and the professor, not the language, but my view is tainted from that experience.",1272869523

The trick is that he trained himself as much as he did the computer. He spoke more slowly, and enunciated the places where he knew of problem points. I don't even know how much of this was conscious - I only watched a few times and never asked him.<p>If we treat our voice recognition similarly, we get much better results.<p>2. Due to a few too many loud concerts and bars, I have partial hearing loss and can miss words myself. The difference between myself and a computer is that the computer is expected to output immediately rather than being allowed to wait for more context clues, and the computer isn't allowed to interrupt to ask about words.<p>These two strategies, allowing for a more conversational flow, may be what we need to improve speech recognition.",1272869396

1314197,comment,1313251,1313756,0,0,slapshot,,,"Very long and abstract to get the point across.  Many people who don't already agree with the confusion will just start fighting the details of the pasta-related hypothetical.  To take just one, lots of lawyers will argue that it is already illegal under U.S. anti-trust law to require that buyers bundle a patented good (the pasta makers) and the supplies to run it (wheat).  That's why you see generic inkjet cartridges.  The actual legal reality is substantially more complex, but it's the sort of trivial detail that will trip people up.<p>A good allegory must be short and simple to understand.  Kurt Vonnegut understood this.  His allegorical tale of Harrison Bergeron (original: <a href=""http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html</a>) (summary: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron</a>) is incredibly simple to understand: in a world of PC gone mad, the government ties weights to the ankles of the best ballet dancers so that nobody is jealous that somebody else dances better.  He repeats the tale as applied to intelligence (constant distraction) and good looks (must wear an ugly mask).  There's exactly one step in his allegory: if you excel in any way, you'll get punished.<p>You have to write clean crisp allegories like that if you hope to leave a lasting impact.  Ten-step tales of patented pasta and wheat and wheat-making machines and so forth just lose too many people in the details.",1272869008

LA gets 283 sunny days/year, and now I tend to forget what rain and clouds even look and feel like. So what if the total cost of living is higher by a solid percentage. You can be a helluva lot more productive if you don't want to jump off the Aurora bridge every day because the darkness is triggering major depression around whatever else is going on in your life. Paying for sunshine is absolutely essential for some people(like me), it's not even a personal choice.<p>If you've ever lived through the awful annual Seattle blackout between November and May, where you might see 20 minutes of sunshine per day(they even have a word for it: ""sunbreaks""), then you'll have directly experienced what I'm talking about.<p>Curiously, I would point out this entire SF vs Seattle debate reveals a great example of how we disproportionally compare risk vs. reward in human psychology. Given two equivalent choices, the one that cause us to lose more in order to gain more is perceived as being the ""bad choice""—our brains want to gain more immediately. Taking the big risk in Manhattan, SF or LA means you have a shot to get paid far, far higher than anywhere else, just because of how capital pools in urban cores.<p>Conventional wisdom says to go to a smaller city and enjoy a lower cost of living. That is the optimal choice if you have certainty that you won't be getting those high paying jobs  in dense urban cores. But if you think you might?

At least the EE can tell when its broken.""</i><p>A great deal of terrible, buggy, unmaintainable software has been written due to exactly this type of sentiment. I have maintained, re-written, built on top of this type of software. The correct way to build power grid software (or any science/engineering-related software) is by having very smart software engineers (who do understand or can quickly figure out things like recursion), working closely with electrical engineers (or biologists/chemical engineers/etc). As in, they should be in constant (at least weekly) contact with each other. The software engineers learn about electricity, and the electrical engineers learn a little about software architecture.<p>This is based on my experience developing software for engineering applications. I currently work on software in the Aerospace industry, and I communicate regularly with other engineers. My software team is full of brilliant software engineers. Smart people can learn about other fields on-the-job. If you accidentally hire one that can't, don't fret: there is always work that doesn't require an intimate knowledge of electronics, such as build scripts, support software, utilities, etc.<p>That being said, I do think there is a place for a software engineer with a passion for other types of engineering. My degree is in Bioengineering, but my greatest experience (and greatest interest) is in software engineering. So, while I grok differential equations, control systems, and metabolism, I also understand recursion and polymorphism. And deterministic finite automaton. And closures. And I'm not the only one.<p>My point is this: If you have a really hard engineering problem that requires really smart software, hire really smart programmers, really smart engineers, and a couple really smart people who understand both sides.

I believe change so often because it&#x27;s more disruptive.<p>Some services seem &quot;just plain&quot; blocked, as in the connections are being sniped by RST or something. Others (e.g., Google services like Maps) are in what I believe to be a &quot;degrade&quot; mode, where perhaps half the page is allowed to load, but not enough to be functional, in order to make the service look broken and to be more annoying to the user. I met many people in China who hated Google services because they were so slow and/or defective--due entirely to the sabotage.<p>They also seem to mess up a lot of stuff via DNS. They also seem to disrupt VPN. They also inject ads into page content, e.g., ads in the lower right corner of espn.com or whitehouse.gov.",1383537573

But they can&#x27;t afford them, they just lost a round in the capital/labor fight.  So kick the can down the road, have the workers go into debt to buy the commodities.  That works for a little while, but then the problem becomes worse and a bigger collapse will happen at the next crisis.<p>Despite just coming out of the &quot;worst recession since the Great Depression&quot;, the Federal Reserve etc. did save the US economy for now.

I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;does Paris Hilton deserve her money?&quot; or even &quot;does Bill Gates deserve his money?&quot; which all too often devolve into personal attacks and minutiae and miss the broader systemic question.<p>When you implicitly demand that people work for money, you&#x27;re making an intuitive error that brilliant economists, from Adam Smith to Karl Marx, have mistakenly stepped into many times: the idea that value comes from a day&#x27;s work. That&#x27;s the folk version of it, but in economic&#x27;s early days it was professionally argued for enough to get its own name: the labor theory of value. There&#x27;s a long history of debate around it, and even today there are highly sophisticated versions of it floating around that have added epicycles and epicycles of subtlety, but the long and short of it is that it&#x27;s been proven wrong. Not from a normative point of view (which is impossible anyways, as that&#x27;s just moralizing), but empirically speaking.<p>And the moral version of it doesn&#x27;t make much sense either. I&#x27;d be the last to say that an investment banker doesn&#x27;t work hard, but does he work harder than a single mother on food stamps holding down three part time jobs? Or, for that matter, do either of them work harder than a peasant in rural India?<p>Lots of things determine income. But by far the biggest is economic productivity, which is heavily correlated to capital intensity.<p>As a collective whole, we are far more productive now than we were a couple decades ago, let alone a couple centuries. For that we get far higher incomes for far less work. Does being born in a first world country in the 21st century deserve extra income? No, not really. Yet we live with it and don&#x27;t beat ourselves over the head for it: we do it because we can. And even once developing countries have caught up with us, we&#x27;ll still have to ask ourselves if we deserve greater income than our ancestors merely for coming after them.<p>Capital will continue to grow exponentially for the foreseeable future. It will not be long before the labor of maybe a billion people worldwide are able to provide a standard of living for everyone that&#x27;s higher than people in first world countries get today.<p>Do the people who aren&#x27;t part of that productive core &quot;deserve&quot; the money? I mean, maybe, maybe not, but does the answer to that question even matter? None of us really deserve what we have, so so long as we make a workable system where the incentives line up so that everyone can live rich lives with a base level of income, I&#x27;m all for it.",1383536793

(Although, trivially, you could argue a taco stand does something arguably more important than inverse-indexed search) Non-trivially, though, in order for a company like Google to get financed, it needs to have investors. Now, you&#x27;d be right that this doesn&#x27;t necessarily require bankers, but it does present an interesting problem.<p>When an investor makes an investment, she wants to make more money than she put in. Else, why do it? Ok, so the simplest possible way to get more money than you put in would be to just let the invested business produce cash from profits and receive distributions over time. Ok, great, but what if that takes 20 years and you need the cash sooner?<p>The other option is to sell the stake to someone else. But the second you do that, in fact, the second you even offer to do that, the person on the buying end has the same worry. The only possible way for this to work is for there to be a bunch of other people who are willing to buy or sell at a certain amount at a certain price. That, my friends, is a market.<p>But what if there&#x27;s no one out there to buy or sell your stake? Or what if there&#x27;s very few? You need a market but there is none. Well, what if a person could somehow <i>make</i> a market for you? Someone, who, because of their deep knowledge of your company, companies like yours, the way markets work generally, and a view of the future state of markets could come in and say, &quot;Hey, listen, I know there&#x27;s not a lot of people out there right now who are willing to buy or sell, but I&#x27;m willing to buy X shares of your company at Y amount and sell X shares of your company at Y + Z amount.&quot; You, as the investor, are loving it since you don&#x27;t have to tell someone upfront, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m saying my entire stake, what&#x27;s the price?&quot; Because that would be extreme adverse selection and would lower your price. And further, you don&#x27;t have to say, &quot;I&#x27;d like to double my share,&quot; thereby hinting you know something and the price should be higher. A market is made: there&#x27;s a standing price to sell at X, and a standing price to buy at Y.<p>This actually happens all over the place. Facebook, amazon, google, et al. make money by being platforms for other people to create content. Facebook as a platform is obvious. For google, they are really the platform for the internet itself. No matter what firm w&#x27;re talking about, the only way for content-creators to be willing to share is if there are enough people to consume/listen. And for there to be enough people to listen, there has to be someone who aggregates. And for someone to aggregate it necessitates a huge amount of upfront investment. Meaning, for example, that Facebook had to build itself before a billion people used it. Yes, this was in stages. But at each stage, it required a huge amount of risk <i>before</i> other people were there to use it. The same with google. Same with amazon. You see, these firms are <i>underwriting</i> the act of sharing content. Their knowledge of the eventual payoff allows them to buy the time, commitment, etc before there is an obvious customer. They have made a market.<p>Now, while Google, Amazon, and Facebook are doing this for things on the internet. Goldman is doing it for the Googles, Amazons, and Facebooks <i>themselves</i>. Goldman is providing a platform for the businesses <i>in general</i>. And, not only that, for anything that has substantial future cash flows!<p>It might seem that anybody could do this. Like why not Tim Ferriss on Angellist-Underwrite? That isn&#x27;t so clear. The only reason Goldman can afford to post a bid and offer (i.e. make a market in cash-flows generally) is to have a better idea of the value of that something than whomever they are transacting with. Goldman has to think, &quot;Ok, we&#x27;ll buy/sell at x/y price because we know the real price that is z and so we can make money by offering the spread x - y.&quot; And guess what? In order to know that, they have to spend what seems like a life-wasting amount of time getting into the minutiae of esoteric financial knowledge. Because, remember, it&#x27;s not that the market-maker is just connecting buyers and sellers. The market-maker is actually fronting the money--bearing the risk, by posting a bid and offer--in order for there to be a guarantee of the market. So the stakes are huge.<p>Now, in the future, it <i>will</i> be Tim Ferriss on AngelList-Underwrite. But he will hire 10 guys/gals to help him analyze markets. And then will he will get a lot of software to help aggregate information. And then he will want to be near the action, so he&#x27;ll get an office in SF. And before you know it, he will be Goldman Sachs in jeans.<p>In the end, the only way for a platform to exist of any type is for someone somewhere to bear the initial risk on an unconditional (not knowing if a person is buying or selling) basis. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a Facebook, a taco stand, the Hoover Dam or asset-backed securities. Goldman (and the other mega dealer-banks) are facilitating a platform for the entire world to unload cash-flows: the platforms&#x27; platform. And if you pick Finance as a career, it will be thankless, often boring, hard and people will likely not understand what you do and will demonize you for it.

Only recently we got a SCOTUS decision that proclaimed US citizens have right to own guns, and that was a close one too. Before that, many places existed where private ownership of guns was essentially banned, and many still exist now, even though with the new decision they will be eventually phased out. However, people that instituted these bans are still in power in those places, and they very well intend to put a good fight and make obtaining legal guns as difficult as is could be without running afoul of the law, and probably more difficult just to see if they can get away with it.<p>Regulation of guns would absolutely help nothing unless you ban possession of guns by healthy individuals without criminal record or any other problems - because you can not predict people going crazy, and you can not eliminate all sources of obtaining weapons by somebody very smart, very determined and having absolutely no moral problem to lie or commit any unethical or criminal behavior.  In fact, even completely removing all guns from law-abiding citizens would not change that - criminals will still have guns. Only coordinated campaign of terror and totalitarian control from the state - something of Soviet or North Korean measures - can make guns relatively unavaliable to common person. If you doubt that, think about how much successful were governmental efforts to make illegal drugs unavailable.<p>Given that, I would rather live with relatively small threat of psychos than in a totalitarian state needed to get rid of the threat of psychos.",1355646540

I understand these weren't available at the time of The War of American Independence, but going by the spirit of the Second Amendment, one would want people fighting tyranny to have the most effective weapons possible to do said fighting. Those(IEDs etc) seem to be the most effective weapons for a guerilla force fighting a tyrannical government (vs  Glocks or whatever).<p>And if you are considering <i>non</i> guerilla forces facing off with government forces, you probably need artillery and heavy machine guns (to start with).",1355645593

We know that the child has wild mood swings and alternates between ""normal"" and ""manipulative and violent"". I don't think it's clear at all that his behavior is due to raw intelligence. To be more blunt, this seems like armchair psychology with <i>nothing</i> in the blog post (or the other cases referenced in this thread) to support this perspective.<p>There needs to be substantial support if we are to believe that a child that experiences psychotically violent phases is doing so for logically sound reasons, because our current understanding of disorders such as this point in the opposite direction.<p>> <i>""As far as anyone becoming more isolated...Why does a person have to be social in the first place""</i><p>I think you're conflating two issues. There is indeed no reason to <i>force</i> anyone to be social - but the reality is that even in the 21st century it is practically impossible to lead a life without social contact. Even the most ardent hermit <i>must</i> interact with the rest of the world at some point.<p>The question here, in the context of the tragedy that occurred this week, is not about the child. It is about whether or not, if left alone without interference, the child will eventually pose a substantial threat to society at large. It's about the state of mental health care in this country and whether or not people like this child need to be ""fixed"".<p>And when it comes to explosively violent people - particularly people who can be set off by unpredictable triggers (the child's mother, after caring for him for <i>years</i> still has no handle on his triggers, and there is no real reason to believe the mother is unbelievably daft) - I emphatically believe that it is correct to pathologize this behavior.",1355645504

[Note: I come from NZ, so the perspective of a largely state-run health system].<p>I think that humane mental institutions would be a much better alternative to prison or surgical intervention.<p>A lot of people were locked up in mental institutions right up until the late 80s, early 90s. Often, people who should not have really been in them. I know people who were seriously fried by drugs administered largely to induce docility, and the brutal ECT of 50s-70s.<p>There were some serious problems with the way these institutions were run which were very difficult to fix. The pendulum has swung towards community care. In NZ at least, most of the mental hospitals have closed. The mentally ill were flooded back into the community. To be fair, the problems with the system were so severe that this was not an entirely bad outcome. Many have done well in the community.<p>From here we can divide the mentally ill into two classes: those who manage to function in the community, and those who end up in prison or dead. Sometimes it's the degree of social support they have which makes the difference, while some simply cannot be treated.<p>I think the pendulum needs to swing the other way a little. We need to identify the truly dangerous and incurable and care for them in humane environments before they hurt themselves or others.<p>Identifying when this needs to be done and ensuring the system works properly is obviously an incredibly difficult problem. Essentially you will be locking people up based on psychiatric diagnoses for things they haven't done yet. However in the current scheme of things even clear pleas from family members for intervention are ignored.<p>As an aside, I'd like to point out that you're proposing to take people who might be psychotic or schizophrenic, and implant remote control devices in them.",1355645293

We select our mates based on their phenotypes (like aggression, intelligence etc). It was more so in the past than now. People used to abandon infants that are born ""defective"" (we now have abortions). Parents selected the mates for their children because they are believed to be better judges of ""good"" phenotypes. It was customary to ensure that the family of the respective mate has no members with mental illness. Yet, after millennia of selective breeding, we still have all the crazies among us. The fact that those ""bad"" genes still exist must mean that they confer some benefits to the carrier.<p>The interplay between genes, RNA, proteins and other macromolecules is so complex that I doubt we can pin down a mental illness to a single gene or safely remove a mutation that causes mental illness from the gene pool without reducing other collateral beneficial traits.",1355645068

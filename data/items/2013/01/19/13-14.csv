5083376,comment,5083194,5083357,2,0,mgkimsal,,,"""Connections"".  You worked on connections to get in a YC startup (an amazingly small number of potential opportunities in the universe of opportunities).<p>I'm suspecting that you had a hankering to work at a ""startup"" and that colored your behaviour.  I know many people without any major credentials who are doing just fine in freelancing, making good money doing what they like to do.<p>Never bother with odesk - you wouldn't have gotten a YC-startup gig on odesk - why look for anything else there?  Work your network/connections - if you don't have any, build them up - that's what takes time and effort.<p>I also suspect many people on this forum (and on specific topics) are 'startup' focused.  While there's nothing inherently wrong with that, I do feel it sets a lot of people up for failure (""fail fast!  fail often!"") when many of them aren't psychologically or financially prepared for so such failures.  We rarely read about the failures of people who attempt 'startups'.  Even when we do, it's <i>often</i> a post-mortem look from someone who's now writing from a position of success, reviewing their own failures in public for others to see.  The implicit (sometimes explicit) message is ""see, even if you fail, you can be successful later in the same space"".<p>Good luck to you on your journey.",1358603874

They're taking a chance on me, which almost never happens with freelance work (especially not if there's a dude with 10 years experience competing with you).<p>And also I would argue that is much easier and quicker to find a good startup (just go down the list of YC companies) than to find amazing freelance work.",1358603454

5083355,comment,5080210,5083022,6,0,_dps,,,"Very crudely (Haskell experts please chime in!):<p>Every Haskell program is a lazily-evaluated tree of expressions; the program output itself is the root node and links represent data flow dependencies. The Haskell compiler turns source code into an initial representation of this tree as well as machine code that performs a sequence of reduction steps to turn the tree into a final output value. So a tree node at any given time is <i>either</i> a concrete value, <i>or</i> a chunk of code that can be executed to obtain that value (a thunk).<p>The compiler has the right to choose an arbitrary (semantics-preserving) node evaluation sequence to reduce the tree down to the final result.<p>Through strictness annotations (<a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Performance/Strictness#Evaluating_expressions_strictly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Performance/Strictness#Ev...</a>) you can force particular subtrees to be fully evaluated whenever-in-program-execution their parent node begins evaluation; to programmers in other languages this seems alien, but in Haskell you, by default, turn control of operation sequencing to the compiler.<p>Such annotations are sometimes desirable because the thunk representation of, say, a large chain of arithmetic operations on a list of numbers can be very expensive in memory, so one might want to force it to be reduced down to a concrete double as soon as possible (see, e.g., <a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/program.php?test=spectralnorm&lang=ghc&id=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/program.php?test...</a>, and note all the areas where function arguments are preceded by exclamation points; those are strictness annotations).<p>Strictness annotations are often important for getting good performance out of certain kinds of Haskell code, and are in some cases not just important but essential for controlling memory consumption.<p>It can be very hard for non-experts to reason about where and why to use strictness, and I submit that this is because you're essentially doing an indirect second level of programming. The un-annotated source code describes the value-transformation semantics, while the strictness annotations are a side-band language for controlling the tree-evaluator that is embedded into your compiled program.<p>Hope that helps :)",1358603358

Traditionally, children lived with their parents, even after marriage, until they can <i>afford</i> to live on their own.<p>There are millions of people in America living in much less than $75k per year and doing just fine even in the big cities.

In Manhattan, median income is $65k! There is living breathing proof of people living below these numbers everyday. <i>These aren't unicorns.</i> It's not rich, but nor is it poverty, which is defined as $11,500 in NYC for an individual.<p>Truth of the matter is, if I made $75k, I'd have a $75k lifestyle.

Mathematically his argument is no doubt true in the sense that if you can only accept a perfectly correct program, something like Haskell will always be better than something like Perl.<p>However he is willfully ignoring the fact that perfect correctness is not a requirement for most programs.  He might be unable to sleep at night without knowing that every case has been accounted for, but in the real world you can often create tremendous value hacking together a vague idea of what you need.  Piping some text files through an ad-hoc perl script can be incredibly useful even if the script has horrible horrible bugs due to unconsidered cases.<p>Atanassow seems to be arguing that the fact that the perl script has bugs that would have easily discovered in a statically typed program nullifies the benefit of rushing a script out the door that produces the correct output for the output at hand even if the incorrect cases would never be run in practice.  This mentality is a luxury afforded to PL researchers and other people who are paid purely to think, however it does more harm than good to bringing the powerful ideas in modern functional programming to the average programmer who, in my opinion, is in desperate need of them.",1358601248

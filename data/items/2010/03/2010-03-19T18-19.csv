It worked very well for that and the generated API's were easy to work with, albiet a bit bulky.<p>In another case, more of an experiment, I used them to serialize game data and sent it using enet. This proved very flexible and easy to change/add things, and the packets were extremely compact.<p>Pros:<p>* Read/Write access to data from C++ or Python<p>* Generated API's were easy to work with<p>* Very compact representation<p>* Ascii-dump version very useful for debugging<p>* More error checking than something like json (i.e. it tells you if you leave out a required field)<p>Cons:<p>* Adds some build steps, can be more of a headache to maintain (compared to json or something)<p>* API can't parse ascii version, bad for config data or other stuff that might want to be human readable (vs. xml or json)<p>* Generally requires copying your data into the protobuf struct, and then packing, rather than going straight from your ""native"" format into a packed buffer.<p>* Adds a bit more complexity<p>* Not as lightweight as json<p>For what you're doing, I would recommend them.<p>They're great for ""structure"" style data, a little weird for array-style. For example, one of the things I was storing was a 4x4 matrix, and I resorted to making a struct with 16 members such as m_00, m_01, etc.. which worked fine and it stored it compactly but was a little weird. I don't think there's a way to have a float[16] or something like that. I could be wrong, maybe there's a better way to do this.<p>Generally, these days i use one of three formats. I am very happy to have outgrown xml.<p>protobuf -- for hierarchical, nested data, if it needs to be compact and accessed from different languages<p>JSON -- for quick and dirty stuff, when format needs to be flexible (or when i need to use javascript)<p>GTO -- for large sets of structured data.

JSON is really useful even in languages other than Javascript. JSON wins over XML because XML is too complex and thus ambiguous. But JSON wins over s-expressions too, because s-expressions are too simple. How do you represent John Smith as an s-expression? Sure, it can be done.

By fun I don't mean comic, but emotionally engaging.<p>Same in theater. I've seen umpteen productions of Macbeth resembling a 3-hour funeral because Shakesperian tragedy is Serious Business. The best production I ever saw had no set and cheap costumes, but Lady Macbeth was greedy slut, Banquo was a snotty jerk, Macduff was a vengeful maniac, and Macbeth himself was a gullible, venal coward. The tickets were cheap, the theater was shabby, but instead of a literature class we got a bunch of foulmouthed armed sociopaths fighting over possession of a shitheap.

When other people started appreciating it and I make other lives better with my work and I get the reward -- you just have to <i>feel</i> it to know, but it took a long time to get that feeling -- years.<p>It was <i>sooo</i> hard.

That's plenty of time and we're growing and I look back and understand completely why almost everyone I know thought I was crazy.  But now they are envious.  ""I wish I could do that. I wish I could quit my job.  I have a mortgage.""  I had to move back to my childhood home in the middle of nowhere to make ends meet. I had to make <i>real</i> sacrifice.  I was living <i>on</i> the beach when I quit.  Now I'm 1500 miles from salt water, but I'm <i>happy</i>.<p>I do think sales is hard though. I don't get why <i>they</i> don't get it.

People like me don't stay here.  Technology people who work for the corporations are actually consultants who live in the huge metro areas -- in <i>other</i> states!  They fly in on monday and fly home on friday.<p>I work with companies all over the world, but people in my own town -- in my own state for the most part -- don't even understand what I'm doing and I wonder how or when I'll break through, but I'm going to keep trying.  Next time I'll put the payment options on the form.<p>I've gotten it down to three options: Fixed fee, Hourly rate, or Revenue share.  I have learned from past experience, that if you just put a price, people say no. If you give them options, they have something to think about.  Some people want to take no risk.  Some want to know what it'll cost up front and some just want the absolute best you can produce.<p><i>Every</i> potential customer is different. I can't seem to find a strategy that always works and it's difficult for me to predict how people will react and how to figure out which kind of customer the person is.  Are there subtle questions I can ask?  Can I tell from looking at their business or customers how I can convince them to proceed.  It's good technology. I know for almost sure that I can help them, but they are suspicious. They don't understand and don't want to be taken for a ride.  How do I reassure them?  How do I let them know I'm not one of those business guys who just wants to take their money?<p>I read lots of books and keep trying, but I don't know if it's easier to pick up sales. There is an aspect of gift to it I think. Persuasiveness. That ""status"" part of the theater class thread from the other day.  Lots can be learned, but it takes a lot of practice and a lot of time and a lot of -- just numbers, really.  Take your pride out of it.  Be confident and tell everyone you know.  Don't worry that you sound like you're tooting your own horn.  That's what you have to do.  If you don't tell anyone, no one will know.<p>I don't begrudge sales guys for what they can do.

It makes me think of generally how our relationship to music has changed over the past 20 years.<p>I have often thought of the jazz of the 1950's as being about as good as it gets when it comes to American cultural production. Take the production of Mingus and Monk as examples and you have two very different kinds of genius that produced challenging music to listen to.<p>It is really hard to listen to that music and do something else. Except ride subways - back in the late 80's living in Brooklyn used to listen to CDs while barrelling home at night on the G train or L train... But is demands your attention in a different way and can frankly at times be upsetting to listen to.<p>In the right (or wrong) frame of mind a song like Monk's version of ""The man I love"" or Sarah Vaughn's ""April in Paris"" or Mingus'  ""Ecclusiastics"" can unhinge me -<p>And even when the Jazz is more popular in orientation - if it is good it bears repeated listenings. ""kind of Blue"" - despite being overplayed stands up. The ""Ella and Louis""
albums likewise. That stuff is way overplayed and yet you can listen to it and get something new out of it.<p>On the other hand most music today is designed to be what Tom Waits describes in the intro to ""Better off without a wife"", music that is:<p>""... you know, you put a little nice music on. Maybe you put on like... you know... like shopping music, something that's not too interruptive...""<p>Most music is designed to not interrupt the flow of commerce, not it interrupt advertising but to fall in line in a supporting role.<p>I am old enough to remember a time in which it seemed that some music was immune to commercialization. I know this sounds naive - and it is. It was very disturbing for me to see the Rolling Stones selling cars or Iggy Pop selling cruises. Or seeing pictures of Jack Kerouac in a Gap jeans ad. And yet I can see now that in most cases (Rolling Stones, etc) that it I was just a logical extension of the form itself. There was no real transgression - just my frame of mind.<p>There is a radio show on my local NPR (WNYC) - and I think it is syndicated on Sirius. Jonathan Schwartz - ""American Songbook"" or something like that. I find the music not mostly to my taste (he is a big Sinatra fan) but to hear Schwartz talk about songs and instrumentation and specifics of a performance (the drummer had a cold that day, etc, etc) and it is the closest that I listen to music in the course of a week. I really love the guy's ethos (if I can only take and hour or so of the show.)<p>On a different tangent - when I was back in college (late 80's- early 90's) I had a friend who was an audiophile. He had ridiculous equipment especially for a dorm/student apartment. Dedicated mono amps for each stereo channel, finely balanced belt driven turntables. We would listen to recordings and he would point out things like the low bass rumbling of the subway passing by Carnegie Hall. Or how in the dark you could almost visualize the spacial arrangement of a string quartet.<p>To be honest I am not that musical and most of the times the things he discussed went over my head. The one thing that I could hear at the time was the difference between digital recording and analog on his system.<p>But for me it was an object lesson in the specificity of a performance that is often lost today.

Probably a dozen times a year, I do try and avoid such places as I don't like walking in faeces ...<p>I am in the city (<2km from midtown Manhattan) and the dog parks are fenced in areas where someone would not walk through faeces.<p>The fighting thing I will grant you as my point was anecdotal and yours was as well. There are very different attitudes regarding dogs and dog behaviour in different areas.<p>In the yuppie area that I live in it is pretty bad form to not clean up your dog's crap or to let your dog fight. So it doesnt tend to happen. But a short walk away to a more ghetto part of town and there are alot more fights and you are more likely to step in crap.<p>So point well taken.<p>I believe - however - that if dogs are socialized properly they will not tend to fight. In my life I have lived in suburbia and the city and a well raised city dog is a pretty fit and content beast. The suburban dog let out to a back yard where it stays all day barking at passing children, dogs and squirrels is often not.<p>My local dogrun is pretty heavily used by a population of about 500 dogs, there can be 15 - 20 dogs in there at a time. So it is surprising that there are not more fights. The city largely neglects the run so people informally replensh bags and scoops and fix the fence (server room zipties work great...)<p>>>...Thing is if your dog threatens to harm me or my child and I crush its skull under my boot then I'll be arrested.<p>Do not think so - if a dog is savaging another human it should be killed. That might depend upon the local laws but i think you have to kill a dog that is attacking someone. Not worth quibbling about but I was surprised by this comment.<p>>>... or hearing ""oh he's harmless"" as my toddler is knocked over by an out of control dog.<p>I hear you on this - I have 2 young boys (< 6yrs old) and it is troubling to see people with dogs they can barely control. The last nasty fight I say was some kind of mastiff which rally hurt another dog while the owner (who probably weighed less than the dog) shrieked nearby doing nothing.<p>A month or so ago, 2 dogs described as pitbulls in the paper were killed by the police as they seriously bit (shredded a leg in one case) 3 people in an apartment. (Though I found it even more disturbing to think that police were discharging a gun in an occupied apartment building but that is another issue.)<p>I find this indefensible - to keep dogs (or any animals)  in a situation where you cannot control them.

Random thoughts:<p>If your design doesn't accomplish a business objective, it may be better, but it is irrelevant to the business.<p>If data indicates your aesthetic doesn't increase a metric, then ultimately the only rational decision to make is to minimize the cost of your aesthetic. All things being equal, you take the equivalently successful design that imposes the least costs.<p>If the data indicates that your design <i>decreases</i> a metric, then ultimately the only rational decision is to kill the design.<p>There are also probably non-obvious cost factors. A much better Google SERP design may be more aesthetically strong, and may not hurt metrics --- it may even marginally improve  metrics --- however, if the end result of that aesthetic is that every other page at Google needs to cost more to cohere with the SERP, then, again, it may be irrational to improve the design.<p>Companies spend a lot of money on design. Companies tell themselves a lot of things about design. Somebody's whole career is predicated on the idea that the lobby of a class A office building in the Chicago Loop needs to be just-so. In the building I'm in now, somebody spent several million dollars to improve the aesthetics. I think that probably has more to do with vanity than it does with business.<p>Corporate annual reports are a marquee design project. Companies spend serious dollars on them. Berkshire Hathaway does theirs in Word, set in Times New Roman. They seem to be doing OK.<p>Sell me on aesthetics more? I don't see it.",1269022746

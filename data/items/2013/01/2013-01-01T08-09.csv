From my experience, I feel there isn't any specific book or instruction manual to follow. I've always felt that learning code is a simple three step process, no matter which the language.<p>1. Understand the logic of basic commands that you will be using, for example, in java script, event listeners is a pretty important concept.<p>2. After reading the core concept briefly, have a run through the syntax. Remember, you can always refer the syntax of a language, do not mug it up. The syntax will come to you after some practice.<p>3. Implement it practically. Make a personal website or simply start coding a few plug ins. This is where the actual learning happens.<p>I've always followed this paradigm and its worked out okay for me so long.<p>Although for a few initial concepts, <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com</a> is pretty good.<p>Also try reading Oreily books on Javascript, HTML5 and CSS.

4992229,comment,4989579,4992147,3,0,mrb,,,"I fail to see your point about the threshold of replacement. Assuming that enterprise-class drives get replaced sooner because sysadmins monitor SMART, it is still widely acknowledged that SMART errors are a strong indicated that the drive <i>will fail</i> soon. For example the Google study on drive reliability showed this correlation on consumer-class drives [1] There is no reason to believe this correlation doesn't exist with enterprise-class drives (or else, what would be the point of SMART?). Therefore the replacement threshold is mostly irrelevant as the enterprise drive replaced due to SMART would have failed soon anyway.<p>I really don't understand this skewed perception of consumer- vs enterprise-grade harddrives. Do you believe that enterprise CPUs are more reliable than consumer CPUs? How about enterprise NICs vs consumer NICs?<p>Consumer-grade drives are sold in volumes so much larger than enterprise-grade drives, that vendors have strong incentives to make them as reliable as possible. I would even say they have incentives to make them more reliable than enterprise-grade drives. Because a single percentage point improvement in their reliability will drastically reduce the costs associated to warranty claims and repairs.<p>My own experience confirms the CMU study. I have worked at 2 companies selling each about 2-5 thousand drives as part of appliances, to customers across the world. One company was using SCSI drives, the other IDE/SATA. And the replacement rates were similar.<p>I can see your point about the usage being different which could invalidate the CMU findings about consumer vs enterprise drive reliability. But I don't personally believe it explains it. The CMU study + my annecdotal evidence one 2-5 thousand drives + the fact that no study has ever <i>showed data</i> suggesting enterprise drives are more reliable, makes me think that they are not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/archive/disk_failures.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrust...</a>",1357030658

Miniature model making is a hobby that makes use of the mechanical engineer inside us, making the design at the push of a button is not only costly (because of larger overall machine) but also takes out all the fun.

4992218,comment,4990950,4991223,2,0,lawtguy,,,"I'll offer my perspective as a parent of a 10 year-old:<p>For #1, I see it as trying to preempt the ""but it's my iPhone, I don't have to follow your rules!"" argument.  The last sentence I read as self-deprecating humor: read it with ;) at the end.<p>#2, this is doesn't seem unreasonable to me.  Same as I wouldn't allow my son to have a lock on the door to his room that I didn't have a key to, I need to have access to his phone as well.  Hopefully she'd only use that access in a serious situation (suspected bullying, suspected drug-use, etc).  It could be she's always going through his things and never allows him any privacy, but this rule doesn't necessarily mean that.<p>#4: I see this as setting a strong boundary around when phone calls can be made.  When I was growing up, it was very common to see calling late at night as being rude.  I don't see this as not trusting his opinion but more as saying don't be on the phone late at night.  7:30 pm doesn't seem very late, but that's hard to say without knowing when they have to be up in the morning.<p>#5: Many schools ban phones or disallow their use in school, so not taking the phone to school seems reasonable.<p>#18:  I don't see anything in here that says the rules are set in stone.  In fact I'd read the last part as saying the opposite.  The first part I read as trying to defuse anxiety around breaking the rules.  My son often gets anxious when we set a new rule and worries that he'll break it.  Letting him know that breaking the rules won't be the end of the world helps.<p>Presumably #11 trumps number #3.  I assume they'd expect a common sense approach.<p>#1 and #6 don't contradict each other.  If I let you borrow something from me and it was broken or lost, I'd expect you to pay for it.  I think that's pretty normal.<p>Finally, 13-17 seem to be more aspirational than actual rules.  13, 14, and 17 could be replaced by: don't become so obsessed with your iPhone you ignore everything else.  I didn't read 15 as an exclusion of the son's peer's music.  More a suggestion to take advantage of the wide range of music available.<p>I don't see this as insane, but it's very hard to judge from the outside.  We don't know the kid or the mom.  It could be she's crazy overbearing or it could be she's just setting up reasonable rules for he son.  Being a parent of a high-strung 10 year-old, I tend to read it as reasonable rules for a very smart, very obsessive young teen.",1357030199

It was fast enough to run a web browser and most of the CPU intensive work (compiling etc) was done on a remote server anyway. The build quality was actually about the same, the main difference was the lack of an optical drive (which I didn't need anyway).",1357028510

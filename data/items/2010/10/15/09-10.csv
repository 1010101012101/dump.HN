If you're not making headlines, you're going nowhere.<p>This is not new by any means. The story of evolution and how Darwin ""beat"" Wallace to fame is a good example. History is littered with similar stories.<p>2. This is the peer review process working in full swing. Dammit it's very slow, but it works - eventually. Journal papers are supposed to be peer reviewed to catch the obviously wrong papers, and the downside is explained well in the article. However, the key is whatever bad research slips through is caught by repetition and meta analysis. And if these repetitions and analyses are themselves flawed, others will point them out.<p>It's exactly like open source. No one guarantees that open source produces bug-free code but we trust that the bugs will get weeded out faster.",1287133734

The kinds of systems that make a good biology paper are still pretty abstracted from anything directly applicable, so its good to know that the science still gives you the right result on real people.",1287133401

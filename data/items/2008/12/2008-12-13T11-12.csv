396657,comment,396596,396596,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Using eBay buying Skype and Sun buying MySql as proof of the superiority of the US system seems a little tenuous, since both those American companies seem to be headed down fast (while the European ones produce actual quality products), and the ease of buying out foreign competitors was largely due to the availability of easy money that's at the heart of the current credit crisis. Meanwhile the larger trend, due to the US's status as the world's largest debtor, has been the other way - foreigners buying up US companies, despite significant regulatory barriers that the US government has put up.",1229169257

Members of my own family died in the nazi death camps, so how could I be against fighting that war? However, no amount of complexity and evil could make me drop an A-bomb on a city.<p>At some point I have to say, whatever the consequences, I'm just not going to do this. You don't torture. You don't kill indiscriminately. Otherwise there is nothing left worth fighting for anyway.",1229168966

396652,comment,396596,396626,0,0,taylan,,,"As a US-educated entrepreneur based in Europe, I disagree. Their entrepreneurial culture is what's going to save the Americans, since they have the means to innovate their way out of this meltdown; be it through web 2.0 or greentech. Generous welfare state that we have in Europe presumes presence of a stable economy generating enough surplus wealth to sustain it. If we get outcompeted, it'll be the first thing to go unfortunately. We need to figure out a way to combine best of both worlds.",1229168522

I've always found those cost estimators to be rather useless (they are often off--literally--by orders of magnitude).  A far better estimate would be to look at the actual development cost of competing commercial products with a full-time development team.<p>It also depends heavily on how the program is designed: it's possible for the same amount of ""effort"" worth of code to vary by a factor of ten or more between two programs <i>that serve the same task</i>.  Some programmers naturally write extremely terse code that makes heavy use of abstraction, while others tend to be quite verbose.<p>Plus, it's one thing to write code: it's another thing to have that code become good.  My project above has not changed significantly in code size in almost three years, despite the fact that every year has had more development than the previous one.<p>Such metrics would state that the value of the above project has merely doubled since it was originally conceived in a personal CVS repository by original developer Laurent Aimar, despite the fact that easily 95% of its value has been added since the original bare-bones framework released five years ago.",1229168317

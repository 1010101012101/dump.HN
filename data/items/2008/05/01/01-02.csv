177970,comment,177606,177645,0,0,pg,,,"Usually the way startups die is that they launch something, users ignore it, investors are lukewarm, and they get demoralized and give up.  Sometimes there are other forces encouraging them to give up, like the pull of school, or the push of founder conflicts.<p>It's normal for users not to like what you first launch with, and for investors to be lukewarm.  (Investors are basically permanently lukewarm.)  So the groups who give up usually are looking at about the same information as other groups who keep going and succeed.  Most of the time it comes down to whether they see the glass as half full or half empty.",1209606176

177968,comment,177722,177722,0,0,vlad,,,"Up until Google, software products in Beta usually had many bugs.  Typically, this would be desktop software that had not been tested in more operating environments than the developer's own computer.  I believe Google was the first major web application to use the term beta, and at the time, it was a very strange thing to do.  It was probably because they were in ""beta"" that they didn't try to place ads all over the place; they didn't want to worry about that because they were too busy trying to figure out the best search algorithm.<p>Beta could mean that more features are coming soon, like with Google.  But Beta can be the original meaning--that the software or web app is available for feedback but may not even work correctly.  That's not something new, however.",1209605980

177966,comment,177650,177933,0,0,icey,,,"I think your last sentence illustrates why guys like me (unfairly) have issues with Clojure wrt the JVM. I don't do Java at all; I messed around with it back in the days of 1.2 and pretty much forgot about it.<p>It seems like a most of the people using Clojure come from a Java background, and most of the things being done with Clojure dip heavily into the Java ecosystem.<p>Now as I said previously, I think this is an unfair assessment, from me or from anyone else. I realize that Clojure used to also live on the CLR. It's just that it is incredibly easy to implement the functionality from Java (and I suppose it was this way on .Net as well), so that it feels almost like it's loose DSL written in Java, not a full language that <i>just happens</i> to live on the JVM.",1209605627

They see a <i>lot</i> more companies each year than most VCs.  They can't see as much of the potential of the founders because it is so early in the process...but they have a lot more to choose from, so they're able to pick the ones that seem about to explode from excitement about their business and seem smart enough and dedicated enough to deliver it.<p>pg has said that investors (including him) invest in businesses that are like a train leaving the station, whether the investor is on-board or not.  Investors hate to miss a success, even more than they hate to bet on a failure, so if you aren't convinced of your own success with or without one particular investor, you aren't what they are looking for.  It seems to me that you probably weren't convincing on this point.",1209604404

I'm being granted an opportunity to learn more JCL, which is the language used to control jobs on z/OS mainframes.<p>I'm currently studying ""z/OS JCL"" by Gary DeWard Brown, and one of the first exercises has me programming a really simple job. However, none of the examples use straight JCL. Instead, they utilize (respectively) COBOL, PL/I, FORTRAN, and C/C++. I'm encouraged to use the language I'm most comfortable with, however, I have no practical experience with any of these languages.<p>This could be a defining moment for my early career. The code I choose to utilize will probably be the one I work with for the extent of my time with JCL. Therefore, I'd like to pick one that will make me a ""better programmer"" and more desirable to future employers. Please advise.",1209603882

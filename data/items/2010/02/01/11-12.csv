1092192,comment,1091936,1091936,0,0,alexpopescu,,,"I think it would be a mistake to think of NoSQL as a replacement of RDBMS. Its main goal is rather to make our lives easier for a set of scenarios that were created with the read-write web. I'd encourage you to take a look at these NoSQL usecases: <a href=""http://nosql.mypopescu.com/tagged/usecase"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nosql.mypopescu.com/tagged/usecase</a>. Hopefully that would give you an idea where some of these systems are fitting in. If you check other presentations on MyNoSQL you'll notice that many live systems are using a mixture of RDBMS and NoSQL.<p>:- alex",1265025217

1092185,comment,1091369,1091369,0,0,mseebach,,,"No-reply is useful when you want the person on the other end to reply by taking specific actions. I helped an organisation migrate annual dues to e-mail+credit card invoicing. the emails went out from the (active) info@ alias.<p>However, we included a link to get in touch with your local membership officer, to cancel membership etc. which would be completely automated, but we'd get loads of replies relating to those things, and spend quite some time processing those.<p>After we started sending from a no-reply and just included the contact-email in the mail-body, we didn't get a single e-mail related to those.<p>We might have pissed off some people who couldn't be bothered to read beyond the first five words, but I don't really care.",1265024749

I'll start...<p>I want to be able to scribe meeting notes and have them recorded digitally for circulation to colleagues and CRM systems.  This could take the form of a printed note-taking template, where by OCR could determine different sections (attendees, date, actions, notes) when scanning them in.  It is not good etiquette (here) to scribe notes on a laptop during a meeting, and typing them up by hand is very time consuming.<p>What are your problems?",1265023669

That's why the overall team need to be balanced.<p>I think that people stating that things <i>ARE</i> a certain way or somebody <i>BEING</i> at a certain level, could gain benefit from looking at Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics or more particulary trying expressing themselves in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime</a><p>It's not bad being judgemental however, and I think that going with ones gut feeling regarding co-founders is a good thing. I wish I had had no tolerance for bullshit and done away with some poor performing co-founders early on, because the net effect would have been better for everyone. It's the team that counts, and those people who fanatically prefer to do waterfall development and enterprise java solutions don't belong in a fast paced startup environment, because they cannot deliver good results in this setting, they count on orders coming in from ""management"" instead of being proactive themselves..",1265023006

(You can do a surprising amount with this, using complicated select-and-alter primitives.) And it has indexes.<p>The ""mmap and update in place"" design has upsides and down. Up: it's very fast and it doesn't allocate any new space for simple updates. Down: data will be trashed if the DB is shut down rudely, so you need a replica of each node just to keep ACID.",1265022585

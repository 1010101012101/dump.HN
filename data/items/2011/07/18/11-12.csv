2775909,comment,2774254,2774959,17,0,gizmo,,,"> what really irks me about your post is your complacence with cheating because its not in your self-interest to pursue those who cheated<p>Why don't you hold the other professors to the same standard? It's not as if the other professors are oblivious to rampant cheating. But what's the point of trying to catch cheaters if it hurts the class dynamic and if those who get caught don't even get suspended? The students are clearly OK with cheating otherwise the cheaters would be ostracized by the other students. The school management clearly doesn't care, since they don't take action against those who are caught red-handed. The teachers who care are punished for it: bad reviews and bad class atmosphere in return for extra hours on top of an already heavy schedule. And yet you don't thank the professor for trying to fight against cheaters (and losing that fight) but you effectively criticize him for having tried in the first place!<p>> discussed it and concluded you were just racist<p>A teacher is in a bad mood when a significant portion of the class is exposed as having no academic integrity, doesn't want to teach the class but still, according to your own words was a ""great teacher in the classroom"" and ""gave good lectures"". How do you explain his bad mood? Why of course, he must be racist.<p>> all the students had received your email demanding those who plagiarized to come in to talk to you, naturally everyone, even those who didnt cheat, felt very uneasy and worried<p>This exact scenario happened in a class I attended some years back. Guess who felt nervous? Those who knew they cheated on the assignment and those who plagiarized habitually but didn't remember whether they plagiarized in this instance. The students who would never, ever, ever, copy-paste plagiarize did not feel the slightest bit worried. I'm sure you ""collaborated"" with a friend on a small part of the assignment. Yeah, that's the word all cheaters and plagiarizers use.<p>> teaching evaluations dont just measure your ability to give good lectures<p>If you give a better evaluation to mediocre teachers who smile and say sorry when they're late, then that's exactly the kind of teachers you're going to get instead of the teachers who are great in the classroom and who teach classes where you learned a lot.<p>Save your post and re-read it a few years from now. You'll probably be able to see it from a different perspective.",1310990242

It has binary compatibility with BeOS and new apps are being created for it all the time (avoiding the chicken-and-egg problem). There is a variety of them (some open sourced professional apps). It is not UNIX-like, but it has POSIX compatibility. Haiku has a journaling-file system which is fast and supports user-definable attributes (Be engineers brought a subset of it to Apple with them developing Spotlight and Microsoft had been working on a similar feature).

For example, up here in SV startups are everywhere, and you can't go anywhere without bumping into someone who works at a startup or major tech company.  It's in the air.  So it's a lot more likely that an engineer has a friend who sold their company for millions of dollars or who made a bunch of money working for a company like Google.  Or maybe all of their friends are working at startups right now.  This kind of stuff makes startup life seem a lot more viable, like ""yeah, I'm just as good as them - I could do that.""

But it often does the opposite, exploiting an information gap / ignorance; in fact it's often explicitly and completely unapologetically <i>aimed</i> at doing that, looking to create and exploit information asymmetries. You make more money by selling people an expensive version of something they can get equivalent cheaper, or by luring people into a contract whose full cost they don't realize up front. There's a reason advertisers tend to read up on behaviorist psychology, because exploiting weaknesses in human decision-making, to encourage people to allocate their resources in a way that they wouldn't do with perfect information, is a big part of the game.<p>I may just know the wrong people, but I don't actually know anybody in marketing who doesn't have a sort of cynical ""tricking suckers into buying our clients' stuff"" view, at least some of the time. That's the game; you don't last long in the business if you have a purely idealistic view of only matching people to quality products that are a good match for them, especially since at larger firms you often have no choice about which products you're supposed to be selling.",1310989669

A thorough review of all the evidence shows that: a) Watt stopped adding inventions after 1782, and b) when his patent expired in 1804 horsepower of new engines rose immediately and significantly. After securing his patents he left the engine unchanged for some 22 years.<p>It should also be said that Watt's patent was an exception: his connections to power allowed his patent to be extended for 24 years by parliament. However the ""regular"" patent system impeded Watt. He had to use the inefficient sun and planet gear instead of a crank because Pickard had patented it. Pickard patented the crank: a device we have evidence of from 5BC. Watt used his less efficient gear system until the patent expired, and then immediately switched. Pickard had offered to license the crank in exchange for the condenser, but Watt spent a year inventing his gears instead.<p>Fact: a number of significant improvements were made to steam engines by people other than Watt.<p>Fact: the patent system prevented anyone but Watt from selling steam engines because he had a patent for the condenser, without which all other inventions were pointless.<p>Fact: Watt did <i>not</i> license any of these improvements, nor allow anyone to license his patent, nor make any further improvements of his own.<p>Fact: only when Watt's patent expired were these technologies incorporated into products (and immediately so).<p>Fact: Steam engine technology was stopped for 22 years by the patent system.<p>The numbers are not in question. The question is, ""without patents, would any of the inventions have happened at all?"" Watt basically bankrupted himself developing the condenser to the extent that he took a job for a couple of years. It then got investment in exchange for a share of the patent. Would anyone have invested in his idea without patent protection? I do not have any proof one way or the other, only evidence that thousands of businesses are started every year without support of a patent.<p>The issue is of great concern to HN readers: we make a living through our intellectual property. Watt made a ton of money because he could patent his idea. Without patent protection, he would have had to compete in manufacturing, service, or rapid innovation. With patent protection, he could have one good idea and hit the jackpot. Although I may personally like the idea of making a million off an idea, I believe that the world is better served by allowing ideas to be unpatentable, and instead requiring competition in execution.",1310987577

If the subprograms happen to have global variables that share the same names, then they will interfere with each other and likely fail, usually in difficult to diagnose ways.<p>* Newlines get converted into semicolons. JavaScript has a mechanism that tries to correct faulty programs by automatically inserting semicolons. It sometimes inserts semicolons in places where they are not welcome.<p>* Operator typeof is not very helpful. For example, ""typeof null"" is ""object"", ""typeof [1,2,3]"" is also ""object"".<p>* Operator + adds numbers and concatenates. The + operator can add or concatenate. Which one it does depends on the types of the parameters. If either operand is an empty string, it produces the other operand converted to a string. If both operands are numbers, it produces the sum. Otherwise, it converts both operands to strings and concatenates them. This complicated behavior is a common source of bugs. If you intend + to add, make sure that both operands are numbers.<p>* Operators == and != do type coercion. Use of the === and !== operators is always preferred.<p>* Too many falsy values. 0, Nan, '' (empty string), false, null, undefined are all false.<p>* for ... in operator mixes inherited functions with the desired data members (it does deep reflection).",1310987555

I would've been extremely pissed off if I came to office hours with a legitimate question about the material, only to waste my time waiting on a bunch of people arguing about cheating.",1310987358

Various teams in our office have access to this account by sharing the password to the Google Account.<p>Example: company.name [at] gmail [dot] com / password<p>The requirement is to restrict access to GA by:\n(i) IP address -- using custom URL for GA where any IP which does not belong to office cannot access the account (Can you create custom login screen for GA?)\n(ii) Password -- by using a password manger (but firefox will show the password at browser level, is there a way around this?)\n(iii) Using One Time Password (OTP) -- by using GA API to create dynamic passwords for every login (is this possible?)<p>Is there any other way to achieve this?<p>Thanks in advance.",1310987242

One common theme: although espousing a culture of innovation, and although some are very profitable, most are simply not cutting edge, and some are very behind the times.""<p>An informal survey of LA start ups.. awesome. Any word on how exactly you went about conducting said survey? My guess is it was based on recalling random techcrunch articles read over the past couple years, but please correct if I'm wrong. LA has a ton of start ups that have all kinds of products, working environments and compensation levels, most of which I would guess the author never heard of.<p>""In most Silicon Valley Startups, coders know SQL, a major scripting language as well as HTML and CSS. However MySpace had positions solely for just HTML/CSS, a trend that harkened back to the 90s when web pages were manually created.""<p>So basically, no one needs to know js and css/html anymore because they are all magically generated by some server side fairies. So facebook, twitter and google do not have people who specialize in js or css/html because that's just way too simple. Totally. For a product the size of what MySpace had, I think it would be shockingly incompetent to not have people who would specialize in that tech.<p>""Another Los Angeles great, eHarmony.com, uses 40 to 50 engineers for its matchmaking algorithm and servers, whereas OKCupid.com uses only 10.""<p>In your survey, did you happen to ask them why they had such a discrepancy? Because i'm pretty sure it's not because eHarmony's employees are 5 times dumber than okCupid's. There could be a ton of reasons why these numbers are what they are besides lack of skill.<p>Anyway, I think this is an attempt to rationalize some failure the author has experienced at his previous job. But frankly I think this was a pretty bad attempt at generalizing something as big as the LA and SF job markets. Start ups exist everywhere and come in all shapes forms and sizes, LA has lots of them. To say that an entire city's worth of start ups is one way or another because of myspace, eharmony and your last work place is just way too simple. Anecdotally, I have friends in several LA start ups that are doing just fine, have working environments as good as their peers in SF, if not better, and are using the same range of technology people in SF use.",1310987178

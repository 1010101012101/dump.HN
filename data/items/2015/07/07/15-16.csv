The three\nbest barriers:<p>(A) Geographical.\nWant a business where \nall competition is within\n50 miles, that is, \nno business more than 50 miles\naway is a competitor.<p>So,\nDon&#x27;t want to compete with\nAmazon, Dell, Cisco,\nMicrosoft, Google,\nGE, Citi, Wal-Mart,\nsome company in China,\nthe Middle East, etc.<p>Examples:  Fast food,\ngas station and convenience\nstore, grass mowing and landscaping,\nroofing, kitchen/bath renovation,\nauto repair, auto\nbody repair, pediatrics,\ndermatology, dentistry,\nsome <i>big-truck</i> little truck\nbusinesses (buy merchandise\nin large quantities with a\nbig truck and sell it\nin small quantities\nfrom little trucks --\nmay become increasingly\nvulnerable to Amazon, etc.),\nbakery selling fancy cakes,\nwith customer decoration,\nmaybe with a lot of whipped\ncream that doesn&#x27;t ship well,\nChinese carry-out,\nFrench bistro,\nItalian red sauce restaurant.<p>Doing well running\nfour franchised\nfast food restaurants\ncan be fine -- doing well\nwith 10 can do still better.<p>E.g., I know a guy in NYS in the US\nrunning 4 Burger King\nlocations; he&#x27;s from Turkey,\nstill doesn&#x27;t speak English \nvery well, needs a bath, a shave,\nand some clean, neat clothes,\nis great with people, and is doing\nwell.<p>(B) Can&#x27;t be Automated.<p>(C) Legally needs a professional\nlicense.<p>(3) Cross Section of Local Economy.<p>Want a business with many\nsmall customers across a large\ncross section of the local\neconomy so that if the local\neconomy is doing anything at all\nthen can still have an okay\nbusiness; this likely\nmeans no one customer\nprovides more than 1% of the\nrevenue.<p>(4) Small, Medium Town<p>Try to locate in a small\nor medium sized town.<p>Advantages:<p>(A)\nReal estate costs much\nless, and can buy and own\na house in a rural location\nwithout too much driving\nto business locations.<p>(B) Easier to build the \n<i>brand name</i> you need.<p>(C) Taxes lower.  Regulations\nfewer.  To ease regulatory approvals,\ncan know the people\non the Town Council and the\nZoning Board and the\nlocal people holding\nelective office.<p>(D) Usually better environment\nfor having a family.<p>(E) If the economy gets really\nsick, can then just <i>retire</i>\nto rural house and get most of\nfood from own garden.<p>(F) Have a shot at having\nnearly a local monopoly,\nsay, dry cleaning, coin laundry.<p>(G) Can have spouse, kids\nhelp in the business --\nbig advantages here.<p>(H) Have various ways to\nsave on taxes.",1436283782

In today&#x27;s American society, a diverse (and often mutually disagreeing) set of groups see the limits set in the Constitution as quaint and outdated, too inflexible for the modern world.  Some see the Fourth Amendment as unreasonably limiting the effectiveness of national security and law enforcement.  Some see the Second Amendment as a relic of a more violent world.  Some see the First Amendment as intolerant of intolerance.  Some see the Ninth and Tenth Amendments as needlessly frustrating the federal government&#x27;s ability to quickly &quot;fix&quot; problems.<p>Today, I find the Constitution—and more importantly, those who bring it up in polite political conversation—to as often as not be marginalized as &quot;extreme&quot; or, worse, comedic.

S&P rebalances it index through out the year and there are always people trying to predict adds and drops and make some money.<p>The real diseconomy happens in the Russel indexes. They are rebalanced annually with the methodology for adds/drops announced ahead of time. Various funds that are pegged to Russel are forced to rebalance at this time buying and selling huge baskets in one day. To avoid large stock market movements and capitalize on them traders try to predict the changes to the index and prebuy the rebalance trade. Their actions through the market leading up to the rebalance and agreements to sell the rebalance trade to the Russel pegged funds reduce price swings on the day of the rebalance.<p>Trading desks that engage in the Russel trade spend the entire year preparing for it, modeling the methodology, acquiring clients for the rebalance trade, and prebuying the trade. Their profit comes from the difference between the closing price (mostly governed by Russel adds/drops) on the day of the trade and the price that they prebought at. Essentially their ability to accurately predict the rebalance add/drops and acquire clients to sell the rebalance trade to. There are desks that make $10s of millions this way on that day. There may be desks that make $100 of millions this way.<p>PS. I may not have stated it clearly, but funds that are pegged to Russel indexes make agreements with external traders to handle their rebalance trade for them at a fixed bps to the closing price. Traders are able to make money on this because they can take on risk and prebuy the trade; something that the Russel indexed funds can not do.",1436282361

9375644,comment,9374691,9374999,0,0,xrstf,,,"The same holds true for Silex[1], the Symfony Components-based micro framework. Silex and Lumen look very similar (not only because Laraval/Lumen use Sf Components as well), not only because both use (just as Laravel) Sf Components. Slim 3 seems to move in the same direction of modern PHP frameworks, where you <i>return</i> a response from your controller, instead of setting up some global state (the main thing I don&#x27;t like about Slim 1 & 2).<p>For now, Silex is still my favorite, as it has the temporary bonus of having more providers available to integrate 3rd party libraries. Sure, I can drop-in whatever library I like, but having someone do the setup (configuring Twig alone can be a burden if you want to get it right) just makes it easier for me ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://silex.sensiolabs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://silex.sensiolabs.org/</a>",1429030751

The construct may not degrade security under several caveats. Most implementations are extremely likely to share resources, which will introduce weaknesses. I&#x27;d wager those weaknesses would degrade security much more than the composition would enhance it, but it&#x27;d depend on the exact situation.<p>> Yes but it would involve highly paid cryptoanalysts. My proposal is first of all to disprove the root of this thread. Secondly, it makes surveillance more expensive while it&#x27;s free for us. That what&#x27;s cryptography all about. Making their life harder while not so much for us.<p>My exact point was that those cryptographers would already need to develop generic attacks for all the non-standard (read: non-secure) cryptosystems out there. Composing a homegrown cipher with a peer-reviewed secure cipher will not make their lives harder. It will make maintaining and improving the system harder. The net result is overwhelmingly likely to be detrimental.",1429030722

The problem was that the <i>Java language designers</i> didn&#x27;t understand generics, and accidentally implemented varargs in 1.5 in a way that produced a completely unnecessary and avoidable collision with the parametric polymorphism system (designed by Wadler) that they also introduced in 1.5.

The &quot;devops revolution&quot; <i>is</i> the &quot;evolution retardant&quot; you&#x27;re talking about: the engine of evolution is adaptability and incremental innovation.  The Arch philosophy optimizes for adaptability over efficiency: by giving users who are so inclined the tools necessary to understand and interact with the inherent complexity of the system, rather than rely on opaque processes hidden beneath simplistic frontends, it enables users to more effectively adapt their tools to their own needs, solve problems by understanding what&#x27;s actually causing them, develop new techniques that better serve their purposes, and discover new purposes that their existing tools and systems can serve.  Approaches which seek to maximize the <i>efficiency</i> of existing tools and processes are necessarily less adaptable to change, and reliance on them <i>stagnates</i> evolutionary progress.<p>If you&#x27;re looking at documentation filled with console commands as an analogue of &quot;click here to install the system&quot; automated tools, then you&#x27;re missing the point: that list of commands isn&#x27;t there for you to blindly copy and paste into your shell.  It&#x27;s there for you to <i>read and understand</i>, so you can learn how the system and the tools that manage it work, so you can ultimately use them in the way that best serves your own purposes.<p>> sent to you with a monthly magazin that contains lots of manual input instructions for your modern device (and a lot of comics)?<p>I&#x27;d love it.  I absolutely <i>hate</i> the feeling of constraint and limitation I have on e.g. modern mobile devices.  I ended up switching from iOS to Android precisely because of the increasingly common frustration that I felt when I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my phone, but couldn&#x27;t, because Apple didn&#x27;t expose the functionality that was clearly there for me to control and direct in the way I wanted to.  I was artificially locked into someone else&#x27;s way of doing things, and any particular use case that they didn&#x27;t think of in advance was something that was just blocked off to me; and the best I could do was petition that someone else to modify my tools to fit my purposes.<p>I&#x27;d absolutely love a phone OS that made it as easy to understand and control the functionality of the phone as Arch makes it easy to understand and control the desktop, and I&#x27;d gladly read a regular publication that was consistently full of information that improved my understanding of how it all works.<p>It&#x27;s becoming increasingly apparent that there are two distinct cultures of technology: one that seeks to use technology to extend and improve human capabilities, and one that seeks to use technology to <i>replace</i> human capabilities. Arch is for the former, and sealed black boxes that &quot;just work&quot; are for the latter.",1429030485

I do however thing that the ULA system is a primarily-mechanical solution while SpaceX is using a primarily-computer based solution.<p>Background - I have a BS in mechanical engineering, work professionally as a software engineer now, and spent a few years in the defense industry working on nuclear submarines.<p>Both approaches have key mechanical and computer/control challenges. However ULA&#x27;s primarily relies on increased mechanical complexity with relatively simple computers. They are adding separation between the tanks and the engines in the first stage. This is relatively proven tech - we separate stages all the time - but it will complicate the piping and structural design of the first stage considerably. There are also mechanical components related to the hyper cone and the parachutes. The whole thing then follows a relatively simple trajectory and then relies on the skill of human pilots to capture the falling engines. We have done this, but again they&#x27;re using mechanical systems & proven techniques to recover the engines.<p>Meanwhile, the Falcon 9 doesn&#x27;t use a whole lot of extra mechanical components to be reusuable. Arguably the only extra bits are the legs and the grid fins. The grid fins are very simple. The legs are a bit more complicated, but probably less than what it takes to separate the entire engine assembly. SpaceX puts all the complexity in the control <i>software</i>. The engines are re-firing multiple times, and during the last few minutes of landing the computer is doing some serious work to balance everything out. At the end of the day, there is no human interaction on the landing.<p>You often see this trade off between mechanical complexity and software complexity in systems that bridge the domains. I&#x27;d personally bet on the company using the primarily software driven approach nearly every time. Software is hard, but mechanical systems are even harder. The economics of software are also way better. Manufacturing costs are pretty much linear to number of rockets, there isn&#x27;t that much scale in the current market to reduce unit costs. Software costs are relatively fixed compared to number of launches, plus lead times are dramatically different.",1429030051

The best book to slowly work through is &quot;To Mock a Mockingbird&quot;, by Raymond Smullyan. After that you&#x27;ll have a conception of what computation is. All computation is is substituting something in place of something else, or forgetting it, in a systematic way. From that point, you can move to something like the programming language Racket, which has a very simple syntax that is close to the lambda calculus. After this, you ought to be experienced enough to follow whatever path you wish to, for example understanding Javascript and how HTML on a webpage is scripted by it in response to user actions.<p>My best wishes to you.",1429029227

This requires understanding a lot more about how the market and bidding process actually functions, but there really isn&#x27;t a single canonical price at any point, and there are many ways to define what you&#x27;re looking for, depending on what you&#x27;re referring to - <i>all of which are valid</i> according to different assumptions.<p>Think of it as a special kind of eventually-consistent database. Depending on the consistency model, you can&#x27;t ask what the value of x is <i>right now</i>, because there are multiple possible values that are all valid. It&#x27;s only after they converge (which takes time) that a single, canonical value emerges.<p>This is one of the reasons that quotes are always delayed - it&#x27;s possible to talk about what the price was at some point in the past, because those ways of defining the price dynamically have all essentially converged to the same value, but it&#x27;s not possible to pinpoint a single price in the present.<p>To get all of the various sources of real-time data that can be considered the &quot;current price&quot; requires a lot of low-latency connections to various market players.

It was a &quot;partial plaintext&quot; attack, where the &quot;CC&quot; in question was plain old gzip. Basically the attackers controlled a small part of the plaintext (for example, a field in an HTTPS request they could send with CSRF) and they were able to use known properties of the CC to get some information to leak into the message length -- namely, if the message fragment they controlled appeared elsewhere in the request, the gzip encoding would be shorter, and hence the encrypted request would be shorter.

You do need to be careful, though.<p>An MS can be a good way to build a portfolio, gain some skills that are hard to develop while working full time, and explore interesting ideas and options that might turn into a startup or software application.  It isn&#x27;t the only way, of course, but it can be a good way.<p>The ground rules:<p>1) don&#x27;t go heavily into debt<p>If you are pursuing an academic MS, you can often get a TA position that will reduce or eliminate your tuition while paying a stipend.  Alternatively, consider a highly regarded public university with relatively low tuition - for complicated reasons I won&#x27;t get into here, public graduate programs in CS/Engineering tend to rank far more highly than the general undergraduate programs.<p>I want to emphasize the debt thing again here - if you go heavily into debt, none of this is worth it.  I hear what I can only call horror stories about people going 100k into debt for an MS in things like religious studies.  I&#x27;m not surprised some people are passionate about this field, and by all means, they should find a way to pursue it.  But I&#x27;m amazed that the federal gov&#x27;t created a special non-dischargable kind of debt that allows people to go 100K or more into debt for masters degrees with such limit career earning potential.<p>By contrast, 10-20k of debt with a MS from a reputable engineering school is no big deal.  Really, the loss of income eclipses this, since people who can apply to MS STEM programs are usually already capable of earning a decent salary.<p>2) choose a program with flexible requirements.<p>If you get into a reputable MS program in a STEM field, odds are good you&#x27;ve already done mathematically rigorous and highly structured undergraduate degree.  Your new program should allow you to choose courses that match your more specialized interests.<p>3) it&#x27;s ok to take a relatively easy academic load and pursue side projects. Maybe even better.<p>This is where I fell down a bit.  At Berkeley, I could have taken Intellectual Property through the SIMS/Law schools, product development through the MBA/Engineering schools.  Instead, I dropped those courses to keep up with advanced nonlinear optimization and integer programming.  Those are great courses for people who plan to be research professors in those fields, but they weren&#x27;t good courses for me.  I would have enjoyed myself more and gotten more out of my coursework if I&#x27;d realized what I was really there to do.<p>On the bright side, I did pursue a lot of side projects, mainly software applications inspired by things I was learning.  If you&#x27;re at a good university, there will be a lot of interesting speakers, seminars, students, projects, and other types of activities that are highly relevant to your field.  Of course, it all depends on what you&#x27;re there for, and if you are planning on advancing humanity&#x27;s mathematical knowledge of integer optimization, this wouldn&#x27;t be the right advice for you.  But keep in mind, a university is actually fertile ground for interesting ideas that, oddly enough, don&#x27;t really fit into something that will get you credit hours.  Don&#x27;t lock yourself down with coursework to the point where you can&#x27;t tap into that, especially if you aren&#x27;t PhD bound anyway.  Plus, you <i>may</i> be able to convert one of these activities into a MS project.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s still up to you to decide whether it&#x27;s worth the loss of a year or more of income.  It can be difficult to pursue ideas like this if you&#x27;re working full time, and what you do in an MS program may put you on a much more interesting and fulfilling path long term.

Since October last year the increasing demand on Java Android programming has exceeded this decline, thus pushing Java more than 3% during this period.

Looking back at it now, her cognitive skills and memory had to be excellent.<p>As a matter or practicality, we did have her team lead sit with her before she was ready for code review (at least at first), just to help make basic formatting corrections etc. This just reduced us discussing minor formatting issues that the tools missed during a code review.  As time went on the amount of effort others put in to help her on formatting was pretty minor, but at the beginning it did take some extra effort.<p>Another thing I learned working with her, she took great care in thinking through a problem before writing a single character of code.  To the point that I feel she would work through things mentally way more than her peers that would do many more compile/test/code cycles. So I think that helped her too.<p>She also had everything in black and white, no color formatting in her code windows etc.<p>It was neat to work with her, no one questioned her ability after a little while, but there were people asking us wtf we were thinking hiring her at first.

Changing a single bit in a program tends to radically alter its behavior, in a very non linear way. Program space does not map smoothly to output space.&quot;<p>You correctly identify the main hurdle. I admit I am not sure it will work.<p>However, I think it might be possible to design the programming language such that changing a few bits doesn&#x27;t usually radically alter the output.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you are trying to learn a grammar to draw a blue irregular polygon. If there are primitives with fewer parameters that can get you an approximate output, say a circle, this makes possible a learning path that looks like &quot;circle&quot;->&quot;blue circle&quot;->&quot;simple blue polygon&quot;->&quot;complex blue polygon&quot;. In addition to that, if the grammar rules that generate similar output can be clustered in the space of grammar rules, small jumps in this space may give you small output changes. Using bayesian priors will naturally use the simpler, fewer parameter shapes first and pivot to more complex ones as enough information is learned while, I think, creating these more complex rules close to the simple ones in the space of grammar rules. That is my hope anyways. I got it working as expected-ish with a simple vision example like I just described.",1429028461

The point of argument #2 is that the government&#x27;s ability to poison the DNS makes it unsuitable for storing end-user keys, which, no matter what the DNSSEC deployment goal you have in mind is, is the core function of DNSSEC.<p>3. Elliptic curve cryptography is from the 1980s. Secure elliptic curve functions take you to the early 2000s. Authenticated encryption functions are late 90s early 2000s.

I&#x27;d take some pay cut to work on F# code instead of C#. Everytime I write anything in C#, I keep thinking how easier and shorter it&#x27;d be in F#. Just this week, we lost a whole day to a mutation bug:<p><pre><code>  inputParam.Bar = Baz // oops, now we just updated the callers notion of that .Bar property

Yeah, we coulda caught it in code review.

And you can still leverage someone&#x27;s knowledge of .NET, the frameworks and libraries and all that.

I have, uh, recalibrated since.<p>(The biggest technical hurdle I had was frameworks that didn&#x27;t target .NET, but targeted C#. They&#x27;d depend on undocumented output of the C# compiler expression trees. Those were a bit of a pain to fix, but not too hard. Another annoying thing is the MVC teams decision, since C# doesn&#x27;t have tuples, and dictionary creation syntax is too clunky, to pass arbitrary types as parameters (@Html.Foo(new { this=&quot;is&quot;, just=&quot;some&quot;, anon=&quot;type&quot; }). Then they go using reflection to inspect the properties of the type. That&#x27;s just dumb and has caused tons of bugs.

Media queries, clever nonsense with things like &quot;:target&quot; or &quot;:not([class]) > div > img&quot;, it&#x27;s all ultra-simple because there are no logic bugs you can introduce once you know the syntax – the only logic you need to think about is in the positioning of elements on the page.<p>As a backend web developer, you will find it all very simple. A bit of bloody-minded Googling <i>will</i> solve the majority of your problems, and the CSS answers on StackOverflow are more helpful & polite than they are in many other areas.<p>For HTML, some features I have found useful include definition lists, dfn, nav, header, section and article elements. It may also be useful to check out Schema.org.<p>So I guess my recommendation is to get the box model and positioning down pat for CSS, and get semantic elements down for HTML5.<p>If you like genuinely clever and awesome tricks, check out Lea Verou (<a href=""http://lea.verou.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lea.verou.me/</a>).<p>*&quot;seen&quot; as in &quot;made myself&quot;",1429027963

There are many cases where the intuitive answer is &quot;well, the worst case is that it&#x27;s just as good as without our custom wrapper... so let&#x27;s do it.&quot; But under cryptographic analysis it is revealed that the custom wrapper renders whatever other good, accepted cryptography that is in play completely useless.",1429027386
9375211,comment,9374927,9375052,0,0,coffeemug,,,"Slava, CEO @ Rethink here. There are two aspects that you should consider.<p>Firstly, as Daniel pointed out, RethinkDB is licensed under AGPL. An acquirer wouldn&#x27;t have the legal means to close the source code, and with over 700 forks on GitHub they also couldn&#x27;t do it practically.<p>But beyond licensing, consider our personal motivations. We&#x27;ve been working on RethinkDB for five years, and had quite a few opportunities to sell the company. We turned them all down because we really believe in the product. The world is clearly moving towards realtime apps, and we feel it&#x27;s extremely important for open realtime infrastructure to exist. It&#x27;s easy for people to make promises about the future, but consider this from a game-theoretic point of view. If we wanted to sell, we could have done it long ago. I know it&#x27;s not a guarantee, but hopefully it&#x27;s a strong signal to help with your decision.<p>(Also, there are lots of really interesting companies building products on RethinkDB that we can&#x27;t talk publicly about yet. It would be silly to sell given that momentum)",1429027383

9375194,comment,9374802,9375000,0,0,jocluteseh,,,"1. Why?  An unqualified blanket statement does not prove anything. SPF, DKIM, DMARC provide strong cryptographical ties to a specific, real, and verified account holder.  DNSSEC provides domain level certification.  So, with all four items, there is a very strong assurance level of the validity of the email account holder.  Do you honestly disagree?<p>2. Can DNSSEC be re-directed to incorrect public keys? Sure.  But DNS can be pointed anywhere anyway.  DNSSEC does no extra damage.  And exploitation of DNSSEC enabled domain records is very easily discoverable by the domain holder, since the public key will no longer match the domain&#x27;s private key... which is still very much in the domain owner&#x27;s control.<p>3.  Much of cryptography dates to the 1950s.  This &#x27;90s cryptography stuff is pure nonsense.<p>4. Only if you don&#x27;t value the hard work by many smart people over a long time.<p>5. OK. Denial of service is a bad thing.  If you have a worldwide network, you are going to have denial of service.  Mitigation is possible... maybe instead of throwing out other people&#x27;s work, some resources could be used to improve what&#x27;s already out there... ah... but then back #4.<p>6. Yes it is.<p>7. Revealing hostnames is only a problem if a domain is seeking to hide hosts.  So, this particular issue is domain level dependent -- why not let a domain owner speak for him/her self?<p>8. Again with the &#x27;old&#x27; is bad &#x27;new&#x27; is better? Got anything else?<p>9. Wrong. SSH public keys, Email public keys, DKIM public keys... check your email headers from Google... they all have &quot;unprotected key&quot; because Google doesn&#x27;t use DNSSEC -- the large provider host hiding problem is most likely why.<p>However, for a small domain, DNSSEC is terrific.",1429027205

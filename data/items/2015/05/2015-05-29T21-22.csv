The retaliatory penalty shall be equal or lesser than the harm caused by the crime.<p>This is a big problem with victimless crimes and offenses against the public welfare.  The extent of actual harm to actual people cannot be easily measured, so there is no rational limit upon punishments levied against the offenders.<p>Evidence that a criminal intentionally acted in such a way as to reduce the potential harms wrought by his crimes is <i>VERY</i> relevant to sentencing, in my opinion.  The same holds true for malice and negligence.<p>For instance, if you sell heroin, that&#x27;s illegal.  If you refused to sell heroin to people younger than 18, and also embargoed and beat the excrement out of anyone you discovered to be passing heroin on to minors, that would still be pretty awful.  But it would also show that you were making some attempt to be less awful than you could be.  If, perhaps, you kidnapped any customer who lost his job, and forced him to dry out and clean up in your own private rehab, that would still be pretty nasty.  But it would also show a commitment to reduction of harm.  You should probably get a below-median sentence, as punishments for drug kingpins go.<p>Contrariwise, if you keep your drug stash and your loaded shotgun in your baby&#x27;s crib, then screw you, buddy; you&#x27;re getting the maximum on all counts.",1432936449

San Francisco<p>If you are wondering how your magical skill-set in data analytics can create tremendous value in a hundred billion dollar industry, this is your answer!<p>We are a team of MIT grads and Y Combinator alum. We are building a pillar platform that aggregates the businesses&#x27;s data in the parking industry to eventually solve the notorious parking searching problem. To start with, we provide a SaaS solution that collects, analyzes, and visualizes data for parking businesses to help them significantly improve their business performances. This is an industry that generates hundreds of billion dollars a year worldwide, but still mostly uses paper and Excel to analyze their business data. We clean and structure the raw data, then apply machine learning and optimization techniques to predict occupancy rates over time. Using predictions, we dynamically lower prices to increase the utilization rates of parking spaces. It helps garage owners make more money and help customers find parking more easily at the same time.<p>We are eager to meet you if you are:
- A firm believer of the value of data analytics in traditional industries, and obsessed to use math to solve real-world problems; 
- A data guru who can quickly parse, manipulate, and analyze data from multiple sources and formats; 
- Proficient in Python. Experience with Python analytics libraries (numpy, pandas, etc.) is a big plus; 
- Familiar with Linux development environments. Familar with SQL and git; 
- Experienced in machine learning, statistics, and optimization.

This is an industry that generates a hundred billion dollar revenue a year worldwide, but still mostly uses paper and Excel to analyze data. Through data analytics and visualization, we help business owners better understand their daily operations, and monitor them in real time. We also aggregate parking data and provide useful information for people looking for parking spaces.<p>We are looking for an outstanding front-end developer who is

San Francisco<p>DESCRIPTION
Want to use your design skills to bring a $30 billion industry (USA) into a new age? Smarking welcomes you!
We are a team of MIT PhDs and Y Combinator alumni that collect, analyze, and visualize real-time data for parking businesses. The parking industry generates $30 billion in revenue a year in the US alone, but still uses paper and Excel spreadsheets to analyze their data. This leads to bad customer service, and millions in untapped revenue.
Starting from messy raw data, we produce beautiful charts and dashboards for parking managers to help better understand their operations in real time. We also visualize data for parking customers to help match the supply and demand.<p>Responsibilities:
- Produce beautiful mock-ups of charts that visualize real-time data, historical data, and predictions 
- Design intuitive user interfaces that make it easy to find aggregated data (e.g. Average occupancy on Saturdays, revenue from people arriving at 5pm, etc.); 
- Work closely with clients and users to understand their needs and blow them away with awesome designs<p>Requirements:
- A strong portfolio that demonstrates your ability to design beautiful user interfaces (e.g. personal website, dribbble, behance, cargo etc). 
- Be self motivated: Have the drive to take charge in projects from the initial client engagement to deployment. 
- Great communication skills: Should be able to effectively articulate your design decisions to both clients and developers. 
- Have a basic foundation in front-end web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript). 
- Experience building mockups using software such as, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Sketch<p>Things that will make you stand out: 
- Advanced front-end development skills and experience with front-end frameworks such as AngularJS and D3.js 
- Extensive experience working with CSS3 animations 
- Able to produce animated mockups using Photoshop or After Effects<p>#4 DevOp Engineer

And by clear I mean clear to a reasonable and moral person, and not just a speculative personal opinion.<p>Given that frame of reference, I would argue that (1) the notion that online drug dealing would lead to harm reduction for a drug addict is speculative rather than clear; (2) the harm caused by improved access to hard drugs by more potential addicts would be tremendous and therefore likely exceed any potential harm reduction; (3) given Ulbrict&#x27;s apparent willingness to hire hitmen, I find it impossible to believe he was in any way motivated by concern for others.",1432936099

You can spend and save at the same time. There are many ways to spend and save at the same time. You can buy something you are only going to need later, you can buy stocks in a business that will use the money to buy equipment and employ people, you can lend to a business that will buy equipment and employ people.

Thanks for providing evidence that supports my point that libertarians are not conservatives.<p>> Objectivists, have taken part in conservative or right-wing political coalitions aimed at economic policy.<p>That&#x27;s a political strategy in a two-party system. You&#x27;re equivocating. Communists, socialists, anarchists, etc... must also choose a side in a two-party system. It, however, does not make them equivalent. More ignorance on your part.<p>Regarding fiscal policy, yes, you&#x27;re right, I unintentionally was discussing foreign policy. Thank you for the correction, but it in no one affects my point. It seems fairly trivial to recognize I was talking about foreign policy, not monetary policy. Either way, my point stands. You would&#x27;ve been better off addressing that instead. Again,<p>> social conservatives [bias] is really the only bias you&#x27;ve presented.<p>I presented a general anti-conservative bias, not a specific one. I&#x27;m sorry you misunderstood.<p>> If you feel libertarians are not &quot;conservatives&quot; it is because you are a social conservative.<p>Nope. Your views are reductionist and yet again extremely ignorant. From a reductionist point of view, libertarians and conservatives differ in regards to Social, Foreign, Monetary[1] (as opposed Fiscal) and Federalist policies. Getting further into the specific details undermines your myopic view of non-liberals altogether. It&#x27;s really quite a wonder how much of a disservice your ignorance is to making your own points.<p>[1] Libertarians are unrelentingly anti-Federal Reserve, while conservatives have historically mostly ignored it and Republicans actually helped create it: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#Creation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserv...</a>.",1432935416

9627566,comment,9624123,9624718,0,0,slvr77,,,"Healthy economies will always displace workers through creative destruction.  For example, the internal combustion engine decreased demand for horse whip makers but increased demand for oil workers.  While few horse whip makers could make the transition to oil workers a healthy economy can usually adjust.<p>Structural problems in economies can also create sub-optimal use of labor.  For example, in a debt based economy debt and savings are just call options on future labor (production).  In a healthy economy the concept of debt and savings is used as a way for people to buy and sell call options on their labor.  For example a student may choose to sell a call option on his labor by taking on debt for an education with the expectation that his labor will be more valuable in the future.  Somebody in middle age may chose to buy a call option on the students labor with the expectation that the value of his labor will decline in his old age.<p>However in a pathological economy structural problems can create sub-optimal use of labor.  For example, if deflation becomes entrenched then all rational actors may chose to defer consumption into the future where labor will be cheaper.  This can create structural unemployment like it did in the 1930&#x27;s.  Other examples where the available call option on future labor is smaller than the demand.  For example the demand from Baby Boomers looking at retirement, demand from the 1% to maintain their relative wealth, corporate coffers that can&#x27;t be repatriated due to tax minimization strategies and sovereign wealth funds may exceed the productive capacity of the future labor pool.<p>In that case the economic system may be &#x27;signaling&#x27; to the rising generation to defer their labor but in a way that exceeds their actual capacity to defer the labor creating sub-optimal use of labor.",1432934789

Unfortunately, it received a lot of criticism from AI academics that, frankly, didn&#x27;t understand the problem space which still gets repeated today.<p>Most of the criticisms of using approximated Solomonoff induction for AI has the caveat that they presume a naive and &quot;obvious&quot; approximation that had little connection to the theoretical computer science constructs actually being used to solve the problem of efficient, general approximation. In other words, the criticisms are a bit of a strawman fallacy.<p>Sophisticated approximations with excellent theoretical properties for general purpose computation had another critical defect instead: they had terrible scalability on real silicon due to the strong non-locality of operations when implemented in any obvious way at the time. Basically, you could prove that a different computing substrate would scale up to incredible capability but vanilla silicon was pathological which limited it to toy problems in practice. In principle, these Solomonoff induction approximations should easily outperform any of the &quot;deep learning&quot; technologies currently being used.<p>However, I would make the observation now that these computing models should be practically scalable using recent topological parallelization techniques, computer science that did not exist in 2005.

Giving an example of where such a system exists and works. The &quot;war on drugs&quot; is the wrong approach. I implied, rather indirectly, that prison quotas have a lot to do with keeping drug <i>use</i> illegal. It makes it easier to fill quotas.<p>Now then - the parent and my focus were both more on the users and the wrong approach for the &quot;war on drugs&quot;. A response to me focused more on distribution and extrapolating the legal stance of Portugal. So I cited a Wikipedia page that was more specific and re-iterated that my focus (and the parent I responded to, by extention) were more focused on <i>drug users</i> and treatment doing more good than going on witch hunts for distributors.<p>Congratulations, you caught Ulbricht. Now what about all the other dealers that people will turn to? Especially local dealers who might lace their drugs or have improperly manufactured drugs (ie. containing arsenic) that may lead to more deaths of users?<p>I have no idea how the Silk Road worked, but I imagine dealers had accounts and received feedback. This meant there was some level of Social Quality Control over the drugs. Anyone selling faulty/laced drugs would be quickly rooted from the market. Providing a &#x27;safer&#x27; place to buy, even if still illegal, does more good for the users than having to trust shady dealers.<p>This is very, very related to the war on drugs.

Because they hold the supply of drugs rather than simply being a two-sided marketplace like the Silk Road, they have to physically defend that supply and the locations which house it (from rival organizations, the Police, etc). In a way, not only were the drugs being sold on the Silk Road safer, but the process of selling drugs was probably safer.<p>EDIT: This argument would probably hold up a lot better if Ulbricht hadn&#x27;t tried to have people killed. <i>sigh</i>",1432934063

You can see people commenting about it, if it&#x27;s not stated (and projects clarifying this point).<p>Take a look at fiasco with Veronica Mars crowdfunded film which was released with DRM. Backers of the film said all they thought about this failure. Interest in DRM-free releases was expressed very clearly there. If anything, crowdfunding is a major driver in putting an end to approach of the sick-minded publishers obsessed with DRM.<p><i>> In all seriousness, how much do you care for art?</i><p>As much as I&#x27;m interested in something. If I see a project that&#x27;s interesting to me, I consider supporting it on condition that it doesn&#x27;t plan to use such unethical garbage as DRM in result. How much would I invest in it? That depends on the project. I don&#x27;t do it out of having unlimited funds. Not at all - my funds are pretty limited. I do it because I care for those projects and without my support they are less likely to be created. I don&#x27;t see how exclusivity fits into this. It doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m against perks - if someone wants to invest more, it&#x27;s OK if they get more rewards. But DRM is not something that should be added as a distinguishing factor to anything. Because it shouldn&#x27;t exist to begin with. Would you support the project which says that if you pay more, they&#x27;ll give ecological wrap for you, but for the rest they&#x27;ll ship the product in poisonous package?<p>Another reason to support some projects is to demonstrate demand. For instance, I would support games which are released for Linux (if I&#x27;m interested in them too), but won&#x27;t support those which don&#x27;t plan a Linux release.<p>For instance, Underworld Ascendant added Linux support to the base goal after getting feedback about it. As you can see, this also reduces exclusivity - it&#x27;s inclusive, because more users are reached when release is cross platform. DRM-free release is similar in this sense.",1432934061

This is also subject to which allocator is used and what the application&#x27;s allocation pattern is.  There&#x27;re suboptimal GC mechanics as well in some cases, such as CMS tenured space using free chunk lists with no compaction, so any young GC that requires promotion can possibly increase the young GC time because the GC needs to find appropriate free block size, and if there&#x27;s fragmentation, this may take a while.  Point being is that malloc/free vs GC isn&#x27;t quite as clear cut on its own, nevermind that malloc/free aren&#x27;t called that often.

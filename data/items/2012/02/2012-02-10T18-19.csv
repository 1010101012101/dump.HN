I've been working on my software and have come across a big customer who wants to use it. This would be my first sale (yay!) and would make the company. If we don't make the sale, we'll still be good for a while, thankfully.<p>For those of you doing software or SaaS sales, do you have any advice on terms? Specifically, anything I should worry about or think about? Non-compete, non-solicitation, long-term support, etc. clauses are all on the table and to be honest, it's getting a little scary.<p>- Anonymous, for likely obvious reasons",1328900366

It also seems that what we refer to as self-awareness is an emergent property that living things have, although in theory, not specifically limited to living things.<p>That set of properties is what is formally defined as having a mind.

These are not the problem nor the answer. It isn't just a CompSci issue.

Then we figured out a way to do it!  Oh man, intelligence, right?  Well, no.  We realized that you can stick the voice through a spectrograph and measure the peaks, that's certainly not intelligence.  And that you can detect the edges of bits of faces pretty easily and then compare various ratios for similarity.  That's clever on the part of the algorithm designers but nothing intellect-related.<p>I've never heard anyone say that music requires intelligence.  Creativity maybe.  But I can make a very simple program that has a bunch of hard-coded music patterns that it picks from and nests randomly.  It can 'creatively' output trillions of different songs and clearly has nothing even approaching intelligence.<p>Intelligence is not about what an algorithm can mechanically do.  It's about comprehensive world-modeling that can predict and communicate with other agents.  If something can be coded in a month by a grad student to run on an 8086 then I feel comfortable saying it's not AI.<p>Edit: added the word mechanically to be clearer",1328900137

A slight variation in speeds cascades through human delay in reaction, causing a longitudinal wave to ripple backwards through the traffic. If the amplitude of the wave gets high enough, sections of traffic will periodically reach a standstill while the wave works its way through.<p>There's no meaningful trigger here. Decomposing the whole into parts won't solve the problem. If you didn't know that traffic density causes jams, looking into the root cause would seem mysterious, because the chaotic behaviour that gives rise to the initial perturbation is essentially unimportant. It's the interaction between the parts that matters, not the ""trigger"".<p>And even when you've ""solved"" this by building more and wider roads to spread the density, you find a different level of homeostasis; better transport infrastructure like roads encourages people to take more journeys, live further apart with more space, further away from work and play, leading to more traffic again.<p>Sometimes, when solving a problem, looking inwards, to parts, to triggers, to root causes, isn't the right approach; looking outwards, to the holistic whole, running experiments and simulations, creating new theories, is better.

Setting up the software also includes some mildly to moderately complex configuration tasks.<p>When we win a deal, we schedule development of these connectors, and our field team makes plans to go on site to install the software and connectors, perform the necessary customization, and perform acceptance testing.<p>We're stumbling badly here. We're finding bugs in new connectors, which isn't surprising. But worse,  we're fairly consistently finding disconnects between the connectors we build and what the customers really want. There's also a great deal of confusion about who's installing the software and when, and which connectors are needed by which date. Issues aren't always tracked to completion.<p>A big part of the problem is that we're doing everything by email. Someone will send an email with the latest schedule, but they won't include everyone who needs to know. Someone will send out issues lists, but each time they use different terms to describe the same problems and there's no place to track resolution. New requirements are send piecemeal by email. e.g. We'll get an email that says the customer wants us to add X. Shortly afterwards we'll get an email that says they want Y. Later they'll ask use the status of feature Z, which we never heard of.<p>We have a bug tracking system, but it's dreadful. We <i>don't</i> have a project management system where we can see deployment project schedules, action items, and issues.<p>I'm looking at replacing our bug tracking system <i>and</i> coming up with a better way to track our customer deployment projects. For the former, I want something that ties with out Source Code management system (currently svn ... I'm going to look at changing that later) and allows all checkins (bugs, connectors, and features) to be tied to tickets. I'd like it to be easy for our field guys to enter trouble tickets and connector requests and tie them to specific customer projects. I'm looking at Jira and FogBugz right now.<p>I also want a system that makes it easy for non-technical people on the project, who are not interested in spending much time to learn a new tool,  to post and update project schedules for customer deployments, and to share requirement documents, the status of action items, and the date(s) of forthcoming customer visits. Basecamp looks pretty awesome for this. I'd also like to make it possible for them to see the status of blocking bugs from our bug tracking system. This is where I'm having some trouble. What system have people used for handling these two problems and two types of users?<p>We're a fairly small company (~50-60 people), and I don't have resources for building a complex system. I just want something to get us out of the email h*ll and that can be extended as we (hopefully) grow.<p>TL;DR: How can I set up a system for a ~50 person company where non-technical account people are able to create and manage customer deployment project schedules, requirements, and actions; and technical people can manage their bug and feature tickets; and where both groups can share the high level information each other needs to be effective.",1328898500

OSX widgets may be immature and tasteless, but they're not a hindrance.<p>If retro design is crippling anything, IMO, it digital audio workstations (DAW).

It seems to be working well, and the students really like it.<p><i>""The PI technique relies on the power of the 'flipped classroom.'

Instructors spend their time addressing students' difficulties rather than lecturing.

But the price is steep, about $2,500 for the package.  What you get is a whole list of detailed contacts infos (phone number included) of all journalists who's writing about your vertical.<p>So being an entrepreneur myself, my idea is to split the cost with someone else, ideally 4 or 5 other startups to lower the cost (but more is better).  If we get a group of 5 or more, our average cost will be lowered substantially.<p>So if you're looking for journalists to reach out to them, this is it (or you'll have to spend countless hours going through Twitter and LinkedIn).

3576811,comment,3576432,3576432,8,0,rkalla,,,"The ""serialization using ByteBuffers"" should be clarified that it is ""serialization using <i>direct</i> ByteBuffers"" -- as in they exist in the native OS memory space and not inside the JVM's heap.<p>Direct ByteBuffers are <i>excellent</i> when you can make use of a long-lived, fixed-size buffer that you are using to communicate with a native resource (e.g. socket, file, etc.)<p>My own experience with using direct ByteBuffers is allocating read/write buffers to a running Redis process that I use to write commends to the server and read the results back. The difference in performance using a direct buffer instead of raw byte[] (basically a standard ByteBuffer) were astounding.<p>I have seen people argue against the use of direct buffers pointing out that at some point your calls and payload have to cross the JVM-native barrier and using a direct ByteBuffer simply moves the point of entry/exit which won't change the performance of the entire round-trip.<p>I can't argue with that, but I would point out that in my own work with Redis, having a native process input and output data to and from a native OS buffer that I can then pull into the JVM gave me at least an order of magnitude improvement in speed than sticking with raw byte[] in and out over a socket.<p>ASIDE: I attribute my success here to the fact that I was able to queue up out-bound commands as fast as possible inside the JVM, pushing them out into the native buffer space which streamed them into Redis; reading back the replies as quickly as possible in a separate thread. My understanding is that by moving the ""blood-brain-barrier"" to this point, I am allowing Redis to consume and produce as fast as possible as long as I keep the input buffer full and output buffer relatively empty. In other words Redis wasn't being blocked (for the most part) by waiting on me to push and pull data in and out of my running JVM on every single read/write.<p>ADDENDUM: Just had a fun impl thought for anyone that read this and thought it was interesting... a custom InputStream and OutputStream impl along the lines of the JDK's Buffered streams, but the input and output streams are actually backed by direct ByteBuffers.<p>The use-cases for the stream would need to be very specific and the underlying approach clearly spelled out in the Javadoc, but it would provide a nice bridge between standard JDK stream-based I/O and the NIO work without burdening the caller with knowing about how to use the NIO APIs.<p>For anyone interesting, I'll likely add a first-pass impl of this to the Universal Binary JSON Java libs[1] later today to compliment the re-usable ByteArray stream impls that are there already.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/thebuzzmedia/universal-binary-json-java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thebuzzmedia/universal-binary-json-java</a>",1328897731

Sadly, they are often correct.  But a small portion of the time, they are mistaken, and somehow the specious claim of sexism is particularly odious.  That tiny portion of the overall picture is what I was pointing out.<p>With men, it seems more often that either they shrug off the accusation because they are fine with being an asshole (which is particularly distasteful), or they respond by further turning up the arrogance dial (""I'm not an asshole, its just that I'm better than you"").",1328897031

I love the code golf option on 4clojure for that also, because for so many of the problems I just can't see how people get the smallest solutions - not that I would want to write code like that for a shipping product.",1328896959

3576741,comment,3572108,3573854,2,0,SkyMarshal,,,"My dad and sister are lawyers, and I seriously considered it at one point (took an LSAT course), so I have some familiarity with it.  My impression of the field is that it's similar to programming - very detail and abstraction oriented.  To think correctly at higher levels of abstraction over any domain, you have to know the details and fundamentals of it, be it law or programming.<p>As far as the differences, I'd like to say that there is less room for error in programming, since you're working with a perfectly literal machine.  However, you can create incorrect abstractions that fail to run and immediately throw errors, but you can also create incorrect abstractions that do run, but return either obviously or subtly incorrect results.  Not so different from the legal system.<p>So I suppose the big difference is the relative accessibility of the two.  As soon as you buy a $200 netbook and start programming basic, c, or whatever, you're immediately subjected to the instant feedback loop.  With law, you can take a few courses in undergrad, or go to law school.  But attempting to learn law on your own, without guidance, is probably easier to go off on tangents, than attempting to learn programming on your own.<p>In either case, transitioning the skills from one domain to another will require some study of the core body of knowledge, hence the state of legal discussion on programmer sites (and state of tech discussion in Congress, for that matter).",1328896911

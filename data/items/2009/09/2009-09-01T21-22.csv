799036,comment,798196,798563,0,0,Daishiman,,,"Powershell's single, deal-breaking problem is that there is no integration with the rich Unix CLI environment, which means that it can hardly be used as the superglue that bash and zsh can be used for. Which means that it's basically a shell language on steroids, for which I'd much rather recommend and interactive Ruby or Python shell.
Powershell's problem is that it exists in an ecosystem that does not acknowledge the CLI, and it will not be useful until that situation is reversed. Since, to this day, mos windows apps don't have backends for CLI interaction, I doubt thethings will change for several years.",1251841941

Using Reddit as an example (because I have no familiarity with HN's source) there is client-side javascript that intercepts clicks on links and appends story IDs to one of the Reddit cookies. Next time a request goes to Reddit, they get a list of recent clicks.<p>This can fail in a lot of ways, most obviously if Javascript or cookies are turned off. Also, the cookie isn't sent to Reddit until I load another page, so if I read an entire page of links and then close the browser without refreshing the page, the cookie doesn't get sent. Plus, the script clips the list around 20 elements, so even if I did refresh Reddit, it wouldn't know I'd clicked on more than 20.<p>My point is not the numerous weaknesses of Reddit's approach. Instead, it's self-reported information that must necessarily be suspect and incomplete. If an article on an obscure programming language pops up here, and every single person who reads it uses Lynx with cookies turned off for security, there might be no opportunity to record any views.",1251839451

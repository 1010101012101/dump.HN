So to execute that program, the programmer would simply give a command for the list to evaluate itself in the context of all the definitions that had gone before, And in a truly spectacular exercise in self-reference, it would do precisely that. In effect, such a list provided the purest possible embodiment of John von Neumann's original conception of a stored program: it was both data and executable code, at one and the same time<p>In Mathematics, the technical name for this sort of thing is recursive function theory, which was why McCarthy called his first public description of Lisp 'Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation By Machine' Today ranked as one of the most influential documents in the history of computer languages, that paper established that a language could have a rigorous mathematical foundation. And it signified that John McCarthy had finally come up with a framework that was precise enough, rigorous enough, and compelling enough to satisfy even him""<p>His paper can be found here: <a href=""http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf</a><p>I am just amazed how often his name appears on this book (the first time he is mentioned, Waldrop talks about how strange people said he is).

842861,comment,842685,842833,0,0,Keyframe,,,"> commercial implementations like Lispworks and Allegro<p>I understand that Clozure CL and SBCL are also good. Maybe not THAT good, but good. Thing that bothers me with that argument is if CL or Lisp in general had the appeal to the critical mass of programmers, it would be built - no matter if standards were the obstacle or commercial implementations. They would come and build a new one, no?<p>As for the libraries - there surely is a way to make bindings to other libraries. For example, we have that kind of problem in D, but we can easily bind to C libraries, so that is not that much of a hassle.<p>My deep thought on all of that is what bothers me the most. Here is my theory. Is it possible that the real reason is that there are basically two types of programmers:<p>1. Recipe / Cargo Cult programmers that are programmers by career inertia<p>2. Programmers that think more about the nature of the problem and hack their mindset to the code. You know, the type that thinks more than they code - code is just a splurt at the end of the process.<p>If that is true, and if Lisp appeals only to the second bunch (not all of them, of course). It might be a hypothetical disastrous indicator of the ratio in programmer  population.<p>Or maybe I'm just thinking too much about it all.",1253850235

842858,comment,842677,842677,0,0,azanar,,,"You needed to say these things <i>before</i> separating from your employer. In fact, you needed to say these things <i>as they came up</i>, rather than letting them pile on and form into a huge rant like this. I'm actually having a hard time following each and every point you have, even though some of the ones I can pick out seem pretty valid. It is overwhelming, and overwhelming usually means nothing is going to get done, because no one knows where to start.<p>I agree with the other comments so far that this shows a certain degree of passive-aggression which isn't particularly appetizing.<p>However, I will <i>strongly</i> disagree with the point in a couple of the other comments that the acceptable alternatives are: shut up, do as your told, and detach from your job as much as you possibly can while still performing it; part ways politely without indicating anything was ever other than you expected it. These take an adversarial stance that you and your employer have nothing more to offer one another than what was strictly agreed to as the job duties and wage, and that any such attempt at offering will only result in bad outcomes for the weaker party.<p>When did we get so fucking bitter and jaded? And when did we decide that this outlook was <i>optimal</i>? I honestly wonder if this sort of attitude contributes to polemics like this, because we insist that people have an seemingly infinite ability to remain stoic and bottle their frustration. The alternative of trying to separate emotionally from a job never, <i>ever</i> works. Doing bullshit for eight hours a day to fund eight hours of ""recovery time"" is not zero-sum; the effects are real, as much as people want to blame those effects on the mere state of being alive. <i>You are not preprogrammed to be depressed; this is not a least-energy state!</i><p>The other option is to quit, but employees usually don't until the get to the polemic-spewing boiling-point of their frustration. It sneaks up on them, because they've been bottling it so long. Writing it and then deleting it is therapeutic, but doesn't accomplish anything. The next job will likely be the same, like a self-perpetuating prophecy, because a lot of employers suck, because a lot of employees within are trying every day to convince themselves they don't care. This is least-energy for the employer, <i>not</i> the employee.<p>If you really want to step off this cycle, perhaps it is time to admit what you've known all along: you <i>do</i> care what you are doing 8 hours a day, and who you are doing it for.",1253850159

I have often wondered why. Compared to Lisp, it is inelegant and inexpressive. Perhaps people who hacked larger computers of the era did not interact with microcomputer hobbyists. Perhaps it was too difficult to get Lisp fast enough to be usable on the old hardware, although if it was possible on big iron in the late 1950s, it should have also been possible on microprocessors in the 1970s.<p>An entire generation of programmers grew up using GOTO <i><line number></i> to call subroutines and execute loops.

My primary focus in life has been computer graphics, and my first language was C. I was born in 1980 and my early serious computer endeavor is inherently  tied to the Amiga platform (SAS C and alike), so I didn't have exposure to other language paradigms at all until later.<p>Later on, through a marvelous turns of event I was exposed to Scheme and at first I didn't ""get it"" - but there was this epiphany moment or two where I could see almost everything I needed in computer language for my needs, yet it was so simple.<p>Not to bore you more with details - I always wanted to get into game development. Career of TV and Commercials direction happened in the mean time, and now I am back into making my game development ideal a reality. My weapon of choice is D/Tango, since it really best suites my mindset. However, after seeing a PPT/PDF from naughty dog earlier this year about how they have utilized an embedded PLT Scheme, I came to wonder once again about maybe using Scheme as a scripting language after all.<p>tl;dr; Can anyone, preferably a pro Lisp or Scheme developer give a rationale why it isn't used more often? Everything I've read makes absolutely no sense why it isn't. Oh, and about the python argument that gets thrown around - I like the python as the next guy, but let's not fool ourselves.<p></rant>",1253848465

Perhaps a gesture, like, if you put 2 fingers on the screen (one at the top, one at the bottom) and rotate them to correctly orient the content, then the Phone should take that as an order to change the orientation from portrait to landscape, or vice-versa... Possibly also add a ""lock orientation"" icon just to the right of the clock at the top centre of the display so you can lay down, gesture to change orientation, and then lock it.",1253848293

These circumstances were preventable.<p>Functional code was repeatedly discarded during development, resulting in delays and cost overruns.  This occurred as late as two days before the predicted shipping date, at which point a rewrite was guaranteed to negative impact the schedule.  The technical justification for replacing the functional code did not advance company objectives.<p>Management of X was apprised at the time that the team was unable to resolve their difference of professional opinion as to whether to keep the functional code or reimplement for aesthetic reasons.  Management was apprised that the decision to reimplement would negatively impact timely deliverability of X.  Please find attached supporting memos #41 (request from team member to reimplement authentication), #47 (opposition by self to team member's request to reimplement authentication), #49 (decision by manager to reimplement authentication), #51 (warning by self that schedule would be negatively impacted), and #73 (request for authorization of 3 man-months to address slippage).<p>I am writing you out of professional courtesy.  Management is aware of all facts in this memo.  I recommend action to avoid further cost overruns to the company in the future; no reply to myself is required.<p>Respectfully yours,",1253847907

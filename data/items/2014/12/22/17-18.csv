I frequently have to close them on my phone because it can&#x27;t handle the articles.<p>It seems like, other things equal, slow sites will do worse. So they must be getting some massive advantage to having so much cruft, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t do it.<p>Of my day to day, it seems like only Hacker News, Paul Graham&#x27;s site, and a few other holdouts load quickly and are easy to read.<p>There&#x27;s also less user generated content in google searches.

8784172,comment,8782399,8782923,0,0,bunderbunder,,,"> rather than “for” loops, it’s often easier to think in terms of the common patterns: “map”, “reduce”, “filter”.<p>It is.  My lament there is that, at least in my experience, optimizers haven&#x27;t caught up in this department.  So while I invariably start with the higher-order operations, all too often the profiler subsequently informs me that I need to replace that code with a for loop.<p>I suspect that side effects are the culprit there: In a language without referential transparency, the optimizer&#x27;s very limited in what kinds of reasoning it can make about a function.  I&#x27;m not quite ready to give up side effects just yet, though. I wish I could work in a language that only allows them in functions that explicitly declare that they want to use them, though.",1419271094

When they told me to append my code to the end of my password and I click on the password field, my password would be wiped away so I&#x27;d have to type in my password AGAIN and then add the security token to the end of it.<p>You don&#x27;t need a third field. On mobile, if you pass the password auth, you go to a new screen and bring up a number pad and ask the user to wait for the text message. It&#x27;s pretty smooth.

Instead, I did a deeper analysis, mixed with some intuition about myself, and went with what was at the time a fairly low ROI option (masters in AI/CS - at a time when the average MS in CS was paying 5k more than a bachelors). I did this because I knew it would open certain doors for me, not for any monetary gain.

8784110,comment,8782033,8783768,0,0,tomphoolery,,,"That talk posted by one of the creators of Siri last week highlighted plenty of things that can still be done with search. Google&#x27;s been doing a lot of those things, except with text. I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;ve fully given up on their search service. Search in the future will be more about compiling different structured information services together in order to show as much information about a given topic as possible. For example, if I search a movie on Google that is currently playing in theaters, I get a Wikipedia article, IMDb page and showtimes for the movie. DuckDuckGo does stuff like this too and I believe that is one of the more innovative parts of their engine, apart from of course the privacy features. While the voice recognition part of Siri is damn cool, the real killer feature of that app is the ability to pick out words and context from what you&#x27;re saying (or typing, as the original version did allow just typing out what you wanted to say to Siri) and use that context to perform queries against an amalgamation of services to figure out what you want.<p>There&#x27;s no question that Google still wants to &quot;own search&quot;, but their idea of &quot;search&quot;, in my opinion, is more about what it will become than what it is today.",1419270674

As footwear, the feature embodies a tradeoff that&#x27;s only practical for a particular class of people: Riding a horse is easier, at the expense of making walking a bit less practical.  But since this class of people happened to be wealthy, and it&#x27;s common for folks to want to mimic the habits of those wealthier than themselves, eventually a fashion for high-heeled shoes developed among non-equestrian classes.  That development also divorced the shoes from their practical roots, which allowed fashion to take over and push the shoes to even more impractical extremes, which is where we get modern incarnations such as women&#x27;s pumps.  To some extent, the only real purpose served by such shoes is to signal to others that your day-to-day life doesn&#x27;t involve doing anything that would render them <i>too</i> impractical, and therefore you&#x27;re of a higher social status than anyone who doesn&#x27;t wear them.<p>Higher education seems to be starting down a similar path.  It used to be that it was a thing for the upper classes, who were expected for various reasons to have a well-rounded liberal arts education.  Because of this it became desirable in part because wealthy people do it.  Nowadays that seems to be a major driving force.

Also I am not entirely sure that functional == declarative although that is a very powerful combination.  As far as I am concerned functional programming centers around the guarantee that f(x) has the properties associated with a function, i.e. for every x, exactly one f(x) is correct.  That&#x27;s why your data structures must be immutable.  That&#x27;s why you need referential transparency, etc.  But how you calculate f(x) really doesn&#x27;t determine whether this is FP or not.  There&#x27;s certainly a lot of power that can come from a language that can compose or decompose functions for you. But I wouldn&#x27;t use that as a litmus test for FP.<p>But I suspect (not entirely sure, but suspect) that if you apply sufficient discipline, and omit from the equation the global necessities of registers, you can probably create functions in assembly, and call them in a functional way.

VMS used the Files-11 file system, with built-in file versioning.<p>A more complicated but more correct story is that PCs come out of a different heritage. VMS admins would purge old documents when the disk was full (see <a href=""http://www.neurophys.wisc.edu/comp/docs/oper/dspace.html#userd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neurophys.wisc.edu/comp/docs/oper/dspace.html#use...</a> for an example) and before that point contact users to purge their own space. But PCs don&#x27;t have admins the same way. Unix people learned about the tools from other Unix people, including USENIX and IEEE publications. PCs users tended to have quite different background and training. But a story which starts &quot;you learned poor practices because of your cultural upbringing&quot; might offend the sensibilities of a CEO. ;)<p>Dropbox is a modern example of a file-based networked versioning system. It keeps older versions of a file so people can go back them.<p>(Before going further, I have to complain bitterly: many of the examples imply that it&#x27;s a good thing for workers to spend their free time - &#x27;3 in the morning&#x27; and &#x27;Saturday afternoon&#x27; - on company work instead of one&#x27;s self or family. It&#x27;s very easy to go from there to the narrative that distributed version control is meant to exploit workers. Why can&#x27;t these examples be &quot;at 3 in the afternoon&quot; and &quot;on Tuesday&quot;? Oh, right: because then there&#x27;s network shared directories, which ruins the rest of the story.)<p>I&#x27;ll evaluate the branching examples, to evaluate how unimportant branching really is for the goals.<p>0) &quot;pull P&L statements on a Saturday afternoon&quot;<p>Read-only access to an Excel file doesn&#x27;t require branching, only secure access to the office network.<p>1) &quot;to change our marketing and communications theme. Awake at 3 in the morning...&quot;<p>A DVCS is much less useful when working with single file projects, like Word documents.<p>If that&#x27;s in PowerPoint then branching is little different than making a new directory on the network drive and copying the PPT file there. If there&#x27;s auto-versioning on the network drive then it&#x27;s <i>easier</i> to use than a DVCS like git.<p>Since my Mac has built-in Time Machine, I also get auto-backups every hour or so, even for local files.<p>2) &quot;Distributed branches&quot;<p>Right, so I&#x27;ve worked on it on my own machine, and when ready I copy it to the network drive and tell collaborators the filename. This is significantly worse than a branching version control system because ...?<p>3) &quot;Without a distributed system, the normal way of controlling the system is through something we call Access Control Lists&quot;<p>A distributed system also has ACLs. There is such a thing as a private repo, for example.<p>Regarding &quot;Access control is a crude instrument. A user can change something or they can&#x27;t.&quot; That&#x27;s an incomplete statement. If I have read access then I can change the file on my local machine. I just can&#x27;t commit the changes to the original server. I can of course make my own CVS repo with the modifications. I&#x27;ll lose distributed history tracking, but the essay doesn&#x27;t give examples of why that might be useful or important.<p>Then again, even under a distributed system I might be prevented by the server&#x27;s ACL from pushing the change on the server. There&#x27;s anonymous access to read github, but not make a new repo on github. There&#x27;s not even an anonymous way to make a pull request - you have to have an account on github first.<p>The solution proposed was &quot;simply request a &#x27;pull&#x27; to the maintainer, who can easily see that this is a simple change and merge it&quot;, but that&#x27;s cheating. It requires a human to take the place of the ACL.

8783926,comment,8780098,8782767,0,0,psygnisfive,,,"Ahh this is a very good question.. I&#x27;ll give two answers, the first more philosophical and the second more example-driven, and both hesitant, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m not sure anyone&#x27;s really thought about deeper why&#x27;s like this much. :)<p>1:<p>My first answer is, because of the nature of what a logic is. Logics are systems for reasoning about some problem domain, or put it another way, logics are ways of convincing yourself that you&#x27;re justified in believing a judgment (`A is true`, `B is a proposition`, `C is tasty`).<p>What this means is that, to have a proof `M` which proves a judgment `J`, is to have some piece of data which you can look at. So all proofs are some kind of data, in the same way that all novels and all movies are some kind of data.<p>A harder question is why all data is a kind of proof and that&#x27;s more subtle. Some people actually want to say they&#x27;re not, proofs are just a special kind of data, while others want to just say to loosen the notion of proof and proposition. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good answer for this direction.<p>2:<p>My second answer is, it turns out they couldn&#x27;t be anything else! Consider the inference rule (written in natural English):<p><pre><code>    if you know\n      A is true\n    and you know\n      B is true\n    then you can conclude\n      A&B is true\n</code></pre>\nwhich tells you when you can make the judgment `A&B is true`. When you use this rule, you have to supply two justifications of the premises `A is true` and `B is true`. That is, you have to provide two pieces of evidence, two proofs, one for each premise.<p>Now consider this description of how to make pairs:<p><pre><code>    if you have\n      M of type A\n    and you have\n      N of type B\n    then you can make\n      (M,N) of type A*B\n</code></pre>\nHere we&#x27;re just describing how pairs are formed: you take two things, and stick them together with a constructor to form a new piece of data.<p>Now I ask you, what are you doing when &quot;proving A&B&quot; if not taking two things (two smaller proofs of `A` and `B`) and sticking them together to form a new piece of data (the proof of `A&B`)? I would argue you&#x27;re not doing ANYTHING different. The act of proving a conjunction is just the same as the act of making a pair!<p>Now do this for other logical connectives:<p><pre><code>    proving a disjunction is just the same as giving an element of a tagged union\n\n    proving an implication is just the same as giving a function\n\n    proving the trivial proposition is just giving a 0-length tuple\n\n    proving the absurd proposition (which is impossible)\n      is just giving a void-type value (which is impossible)\n</code></pre>\nSo why are type theories a logic? Well just look!<p>----<p>Now, I should say, this connection does not mean that all logics are type theories! Type theory has a very specific view of how inference rules are justified, by appeal to certain principles which turn out to be computational in nature.<p>Why these principles should be so <i>powerful</i> as computational principles, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s a mystery. Maybe God is a type theorist? ;p",1419268429

From the article:<p>> Like I said on Twitter last night, I can see my way to saying that DPRK was behind this. I can use Occams Razor to apply the logic of who had motive, look at their actions on the face of it, and say “most likely” it is them.<p>I don&#x27;t know if my brain is stuck on some self-reinforcing loop with this, and feel free to call me Mr. Pedantic here, but I don&#x27;t think Occam&#x27;s Razor can take you that far. The simplest-explanation buck stops at &quot;someone who really wanted to hurt Sony&quot;[1].<p>Given that tons of groups would have axes to grind with Sony (anti-piracy, losing customer data regularly, general &quot;Golliath&quot; image & behaviour), you&#x27;d need to have a reason why the simplest choice is NK in particular. I may have missed something, but I just don&#x27;t see it.<p>* Would you have needed super-l33t 0-day APT ninja bullfrogs (that only a state actor could have afforded?) No, the reports make it seem that Sony&#x27;s networks were (still!) much akin to a merry-go-round[2]. So, from a &quot;capabilities&quot; perspective, I don&#x27;t see a state actor as a more obvious choice than a disgruntled ex-sysadmin + his friends.<p>* Would NK have any motive to deny involvement? By my read of their past PR patterns, they&#x27;d own it loud and clear (&quot;we own you with nuclear, we own you with cyber! fear us, fear us&quot;).<p>[1] Could still be someone counting on one of the side-effects of this FUD shitstorm.

A startup company, or any organization, should act as a unified whole. &quot;It&#x27;s not my problem&quot; is not an option, especially when the company is small and the stakes are high. Sales depends on engineering which depends on support and management, an interconnected web. Rotations build empathy, lead to innovative thinking from outside perspectives and give people greater context. I&#x27;ve proposed them at several of my past jobs only to be shot down each time. It says a lot about the management of Etsy that they encourage designers and product managers to do a rotation on the coding side, when I wasn&#x27;t able to convince my team leaders to let php developers from one project rotate to work on another.<p>&quot;Human resources&quot; has come to mean paperwork and discipline, but the real value of the term is much closer to its literal meaning. Developing peoples&#x27; innate capability is very important. Any company can compete to hire the &quot;best people&quot;, but the really smart companies put that effort into increasing the value of the people that they have. The capacity of the human mind is one of the broadest and most versatile things in the universe, but most of us quickly settle into limiting patterns of thought. Just a few days of seeing things from a new perspective can make all the difference in the world. Etsy&#x27;s engineering rotations seem like fun, but I think they will pay off in a big way. It&#x27;s hard to put a number on increasing teamwork and understanding. Programs like this are a great way to maximize that value.",1419267620

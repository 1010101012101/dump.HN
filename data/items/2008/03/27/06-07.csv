147620,comment,147559,147607,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Amen.  My hope is that computers will become more and more ""unitary"", for lack of a better term.  That is to say they'll become simpler in use, even while they're becoming more flexible and powerful in effect.<p>Basically I'm hoping that computers become better <i>tools</i> and not just better computers.",1206600323

147613,comment,146604,146737,0,0,staunch,,,"The only site that I used that and reminds me of HN is Perlmonks(.org). It never had any commercial ambitions and the quality has been maintained for a decade. There's tons of lessons to be learned from it. They use blind voting, have user levels, and the higher level users moderate.  The community there is unbelievably awesome and it has a very similar feel to this site.<p><a href=""http://perlmonks.org/?node=PerlMonks%20FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perlmonks.org/?node=PerlMonks%20FAQ</a>",1206598487
147612,comment,147455,147455,0,0,condor,,,"Great story. I hope that parting words about buying Porsche's  was said as a joke.<p>It's great that the owners achieved the outcome they desired, very positive; however I also think it's important to keep in mind that it will take some time for the buyer to realize value from the acquisition. In my opinion that should be the metric of success, did the acquired company create value, not for the previous owners/investors through an acquisition, but for the current and future customers through it's operations. I think sometimes the idea the companies should create value-added as an ongoing entity gets lost in the discussion about the company's stock creating a return for the investors/owners.",1206598484

147609,comment,147601,147601,0,0,e1ven,,,"I'd reccomend passing on at least this round of Ycombinator.<p>Your family's welfare has to come first- Not only is there the loss of income to think about, but health insurance.<p>Instead, I'd suggest spending the next 6 months living below your means, and putting the money aside. You don't need much, but enough to comfortably live on for a few months, supporting your family.<p>Price out private health insurance- This is cheaper in regulated states such as Massachusetts, but your situation and location will vary.<p>After you have a few months salary put aside, then you'll be in a stronger position to take time away from a job to start a company.",1206598271

Nothing should slide, fold or twist--just a slab of input/computation/output. almost completely sealed, it should easily survive a coffee spill.<p>bonus points for something like ultravnc support so it can just be an extension of your desktop display.",1206598091
147606,comment,145417,145745,0,0,h34t,,,"Also -- in response to the thought experiment:<p>For me to ""apply Munger's theory of misjudgment in this startup to make it better"" would basically entail putting myself in that startup's environment, probing the situation to get a sense of what's going on, and then using all the ""mental models"" or ""thinking tools"" I've got (including a lot of stuff about human misjudgments which seem to be really useful and accurate a lot of the time) to understand their situation & think of what could be done in new and better ways.<p>I don't believe that the best way to solve most problems is by using formulas that are so overcertain of themselves that they presume to be able to solve someone else's problems from a distance, without knowing the details of a situation or interacting in that environment.

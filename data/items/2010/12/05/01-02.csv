Causality could easily work either way here though.  CA, WA, and NC are some of the only states with enough tech companies and tech employees to care about this stuff.  Software has a much more favorable cost structure than most industries; employees can easily fully implement their ideas on their own time and their own dime.  So it makes sense that these issues have come up enough often enough in the legal system, or tech companies/employees have lobbied hard enough, to fully flesh out the legislation on the matter in these states.",1291514187

If an employee of Google writes a song about working on a search engine, does Google own that?<p>I think that it's silly to presume that a company should own something just because it's the same class of work. Does a newspaper own the diaries or private correspondence of its writers? Why should it own the personal blog? If the work is produced without compensation from the company and without using any company tools or resources, how can anyone make an argument that the company ""owns"" it just because the originator is employed there?<p>I can see how non-competes might be enforced to upbraid the release or participation of employees or ex-employees in businesses thought damaging to the employer. But that just gives the employer respite until the term of your non-compete agreement runs out; thereafter, all works should still be owned by their original author, and he is free to do as he pleases. You shouldn't be able just to steal that work without regard to the employee.",1291514119

You are usually not with people you work with (unless you go to a club that is inside your company - which I would not recommend). Not being with people who are your co-workers - gives you the freedom to screw up.[1]<p>For a book on public speaking, I highly recommend this one:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Speaking-Secrets-Masters-Techniques-Professional/dp/0937539228"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Speaking-Secrets-Masters-Techniques-Pr...</a><p>Because it has a lot of different perspectives and views on how to do it.<p>If you go up to the mike at a public meeting and ask a question or state an opinion, that is <i>public</i> speaking. Try it, it's kinda scary but you might get addicted to it.<p>For conversation, the best technique I've learned to start a conversation - don't start with a question - that puts the person on the spot right away (for example - 'What do you like about this painting?' - what if they don't like the painting?, 'What books are you reading?' - what if they don't read books?). If you ask a question, you are asking someone to contribute right away - you need to start the conversation - you did approach him or her right? Instead, start with a context-sensitive statement ('I like the brushstrokes in the painting. It makes me feel like I'm watching an action movie.' - 'I don't read enough books. I feel like I need to find a new genre to read').<p>Also, for conversation, avoid the ""God perspective"". A lot of people make this mistake in conversation. See, I just intentionally used the ""God perspective"". Let me try again - ""I feel that a lot of people try to come across as experts - especially when meeting new people - 'This restaurant is the best' and sometimes I think it backfires and just makes them seem insecure, seeking approval'.<p>Practice hearing people talk about feelings. From guys talking about their favorite team to women talking about shopping, there is always an undercurrent. The secret to relating to someone, to getting along with someone is to acknowledge how they feel and tell them how you feel.<p>[1] Also <a href=""http://rejectiontherapy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rejectiontherapy.com</a>",1291513941

I had the procedure done using a machine that didn't have eye tracking, so I had to look straight ahead and not move my eyes during the procedure. I must have done something wrong because my eyesight had some...issues.<p>All the visual anomalies they'll warn you about in your consultation (halos and starbursts), I had in spades. They were so bad I had trouble functioning in dark settings. So walking around at night was difficult, watching movies was awful, and so forth.<p>My vision DID kick ass though otherwise.<p>My surgeon had me coming in regular to monitor my progress, and when things weren't getting better scheduled a touch-up (all included in the initial cost). After the touch-up, all the problems were resolved, and 6-7 years later my vision is still pretty damn good. I don't need glasses, but my vision took a tiny dip a year after the surgery and maintained the quality ever since.<p>So with all that said, would I recommend Lasik? Absolutely. First, the technology has come a long way since then. Two, my brother had the surgery the same time I did from the same surgeon, and his turned out fine the first time. Third, having perfect vision is something I'm still thankful for all this time later.<p>tl;dr - I had Lasik surgery twice. First time gave me problems seeing at night, a subsequent touch-up fixed the problems. I still recommend the surgery, but when they say problems can happen, BELIEVE IT.",1291513786

I like those!<p>I actually have an Rdio account, because I have a curious bias towards web sites with sexier names/subconsciously believe I am judged by the names of web sites I use. When I joined I had the impression that Rdio would only let me listen to unlimited songs if I paid you money. Now I see that's not the case, so I'll give your service a go.<p>First thing I don't like is that you don't give me a big search bar. I'm not paying you money. I don't want to log in. I even resent Grooveshark's making me log in to share songs, that's how lazy I am. (I do have a Grooveshark account, which I rarely use.) So the fact that your front page looks more like a product than like an easy service, that scares me away.<p>I think the two most common-looking site designs are: search bars and product pages. Product pages are universally ugly and I run away from them actively. Search bars I will type in something and see if the engine meets my whims. So Grooveshark's front page sells more.<p>Rdio fails the Cardiacs test: <a href=""http://www.rdio.com/#/search/cardiacs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rdio.com/#/search/cardiacs/</a> returns nothing, whereas Grooveshark gives me almost their full catalogue. Cardiacs is my general test of band obscurity: If you have them you're bound to have most of what I want, and if you don't then I trust you less. (You both fail my Victoria Pipe Police Band test, which is pretty sad, because I request my fervent demand for pipe music be sated. >:( )<p>When I go to a band's page, I get something that looks like informational bullshit. Which is nice — I use Last.fm for my band-related nonsense — but when I want a music player I want small entries that show me as much music as possible. If I search a band I want three albums on my screen simultaneously. Grooveshark gives me a LOT of music, and fast.<p>But here's the clincher:<p>When I go to play music, you ask me to sign in or register. BAM! I'm looking for a new site. I don't like giving out my email address. I don't like picking new secure passwords. I will only do it if I think you're worth the effort.<p>Right now I use three sites to listen to music. I use Grooveshark, or I use Bandcamp, or I use TheSixtyOne. Occasionally I use Pandora but that's WAY rare. Grooveshark's for general music hunting; Bandcamp is for searching for and buying music, and listening to musicians I know use it (like Sufjan Stevens); TheSixtyOne is when I want to explore random music. Each one is designed specifically to mimic my usage pattern. They look the way I want them to look.<p>Rdio looks like a college design project. (I'm not saying it looks bad. I go to a design college.) While it's pretty, it's not very <i>functional</i> — you have a lot of design choices that go against the way I'm trying to use the site. Kind of like when search engines make gangly content-crammed designs that stop me from actually finding what I'm searching for. I'm going to stick to the stripped-down tool that does what I want when I want it.<p>If you want to compete with Grooveshark, go slimmer, more efficient, and sexier. Make it easier for me to find the music I want than Grooveshark, easier to share, easier to — anything. If you don't, I have no reason to even <i>contemplate</i> switching. The good news is that I'm not loyal to Grooveshark beyond my affection for its design; because I don't have an account or use more features, I'm not entrenched. If you do something convincing I'd consider moving over.<p>Feel free to discuss this more with me, either here or in email. I love discussing design philosophy.",1291513061

I of course encourage projects that can and should to support opera, but there are plenty of reasons not to support it and in most of those cases they're right not to do so.",1291510999

Marx's ideas is that there's a violent takeover of all property by everyone, and then the state controls everything. He theorized that after some time of this violent control by the revolutionaries, the need for the control would naturally dissipate and we'd live in a harmonious utopia.<p>This has now been tried, and didn't go like he predicted. In fact, it produced much worse outcomes for just about everyone involved, but especially the most skilled and industrious people.<p>If Google's deal is bad, save some of that large paycheck for a year or two, and then quit and take a go of it on your own. You can do that because you're free. Under Marxist systems, you're not free to disagree with the people.<p>You gotta be careful talking about Marx in rosy tones without noting how vastly terrible every implementation has been in real life. The banner of Marxism has done more harm in the last 100 years than just about anything else. It out-competes fascism by a drastic margin, which is really saying something.",1291510896

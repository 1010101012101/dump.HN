Steve Job's reformulation of this story, as if he were some kind of zen minimalist monk in the old days, sure sounds better than what he said at the time, which was way more prosaic -- something like ""I just bought a big house so I would have some place to live and Apple has kept me so busy I haven't had time to buy furniture.""",1197667426

89670,comment,89615,89615,0,0,brianr,,,"This past summer I did a couple interviews for a position that sounds similar to this one. If the interviewer is like me, these tips will be helpful:<p>-Do some of the Project Euler problems: <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems</a> . Think about how you could optimize your solutions. 
 
-Read/skim through the 'language reference' section (<a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php</a>) of the PHP manual, paying particular attention to the PHP5 section on classes/objects.<p>-Familiarize yourself with a couple of the popular PHP5 frameworks (cake, symfony, codeigniter), just do get a general idea of how object-oriented web applications are done. If you have time, play around with one of the sample apps or build something simple (i.e. a blog).<p>-Make sure you're comfortable with all the relevant PHP and SQL vocabulary--not just the definition, but also the application.<p>
Specifically, here are some questions from my usual set of technical questions:
-Explain the difference between private, public, and protected, and give an example where each is useful.
-Explain the difference between an abstract class and an interface, and when each is useful.
-Explain the difference between an inner join and an outer join.
-What is the difference between GET and POST?
-In as much detail as you can, explain what happens between the time when you type ""<a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com</a>"" into your address bar and press enter, and the time when Google's homepage appears on your screen. (Looking for basic knowledge of DNS, routing, TCP/IP, and more specific knowledge about the HTTP protocol)<p>-(Given a small db written on the whiteboard,) write a handful of SQL queries (testing knowledge of joins, group by, having, subselects)<p>-Two PHP coding questions, one solved by writing a recursive function and one to write a basic class for string-processing.<p>I'd also ask a few questions about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<p>Hope this helps, and good luck!",1197666281
89669,comment,89615,89615,0,0,edw519,,,"Here is the dirty little secret about evaluating the code you write in the interview:<p>What is on the piece of paper (or editor) doesn't make a whole lot of difference.<p>What happens when you and I talk about what you wrote tells me almost everything I need to know.<p>Less than one percent of interview code I've ever seen even compiled.  What I was really looking for was:<p>- Did he understand the problem?<p>- How did he approach the problem?<p>- Does he appear as if he has any idea what he's doing?<p>- Can he explain what he has done?<p>- Can he defend what he has done?<p>- Does he understand the concepts of order, cleanness, iteration, branching, recursion, etc., etc., etc...<p>- Based on this small sample, do I think he can do the work we need done?<p>- Do I like him?  Will he fit in and be a good team member?<p>So assuming they interview like I did (a big assumption), here's the good news...whether or not you'll do well has already been determined.  So don't bother to ""cram"" between now and Tuesday.  Relax.  And have fun.  Be yourself and it will all work out OK (one way or the other).",1197666192

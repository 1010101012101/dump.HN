6780450,comment,6779883,6780143,2,0,w0rd-driven,,,"This is how I&#x27;ve structured our use at the place I&#x27;m at. TortoiseGit is better than svn to me. Submodules are the key though in our situation these are best when they can exist in the same directory structure.<p>We create a master repo with all the design assets, statement of work, and any other useful files for the end product. Then we have a client repo as it were of the files we serve in the wamp www directory. Because this is physically different, submodules make little sense. For the WPF builds that all live together in the same directory structure, submodules are perfect. My only hiccup is remembering to commit the subs via the master but that&#x27;s a habit I need to change. The files in the wamp repo are deployed to client computers using git pull with a read only ssh key so people aren&#x27;t committing from them.<p>Our wamp files are primarily text either in straight html or usually PHP. We take care not to commit user editable sections so we don&#x27;t overwrite what a customer ultimately changes. This is kind of a hand rolled version of the now many git deployment tools out there and it works rather well.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t gaming nor are our source files that large but the psds can be astronomical very quickly on just simple web pages. I could only imagine what goes into &quot;next gen games&quot;. GIT is still useful for binary deltas but you definitely have to carefully plan how you partition things in repositories. If I can do this, really almost anyone can. Kiln brought excellent binary support to Hg so there&#x27;s really no need to stick to svn. There may be areas where its still useful but the distributed nature of dvcs is just too compelling when your team is well... distributed. I do hear great things about perforce too and I hope any company uses the better vcs not because they think the users can&#x27;t cope with anything new, but there is extreme benefit for doing so. Again, if I could help our team move into Git with very little hand holding, you would probably be surprised how quickly people adapted. Especially if something like TortoiseGit isn&#x27;t that much different than TortoiseSvn or TortoiseHg for that matter.",1385124809

6780440,comment,6776753,6776753,1,0,poub,,,"I think it’s a great opportunity. Shoutcast has a greater installed base than Icecast. But more importantly a really passionate user base.<p>However there is broken feature by design on <i>ALL</i> those streaming services: they stop for whatever reason.<p>As a listener it’s a terrible experience. It’s alaways when you start listening something you really like that it stops.<p>And you could think it stops because I try to listen on the mobile, so that’s normal. NO it stops even at home on your desktop. When you start listening a stream, you’re 100% of one thing : it will stop but NOT when you decide to stop it.<p>But it wouldn’t be that hard to build a system that actually use a better caching system and pretend to be live instead of trying to stream a live content.<p>Listeners already grasped the idea of listening events which are not “live” thanks to podcasts.<p>In fact what is streamed nowadays is mainly pre-recorded songs/stories. So the notion of “live” is absolutely <i>not</i> necessary unless you’re broadcasting sports or once-in-a-lifetime events.\nAnd then TV / FM does a much better job.<p>That said, Shoutcast services are mainly non-live type of streams anyways.<p>So there is a great opportunity to buy the installed base of Shoutcast creators and listeners and Winamp userbase (pro-anti itunes).<p>The main idea is you change the sofwtare to make it work even when there is no internet connection.<p>A better caching system needs to be made on the device itself and on the server side.<p>In terms of monetization, it’s easy: audio adverts have already proved financial success.<p>It does work only because of their repetition AND their relation with the audience.<p>The best example of audio adverts are the songs with high rotation counts: they are the adverts of the big labels.<p>Here you got a system of dedicated listeners that you can target repetitively, endlessly, fairly (you don’t have to stream blocks of minutes of adverts)<p>Audio ads on webcast radio start to catch up with Radionomy systems by example.<p>AOL proved they couldn’t leverage that community. I don’t think Microsoft will do any better job as their main focus will be “integrate”. \nA strategy that rarely works.<p>Of course “a non-stop stream even without internet connection“ can happen without buying Shoutcast & Winamp, but what a fantastic opportunity and shortcut for those who can.",1385124621

So every Sentinel is listening for configs with an epoch that is greater than the current config, to update its view of the cluster.<p>* Now Sentinels try to force the cluster to have the setup of the latest config in memory (but with some delay to try to receive updates). So for instance slaves replicating with a wrong ip/port are reconfigured and so forth.<p>* Finally Sentinels persist their state on disk at every configuration update, or every time a new slave or sentinel is added to a master, so the system model is much more reasonable. Redis instances when reconfigured are sent a &quot;CONFIG REWRITE&quot; as well. TLDR: process restart friendly.<p>In general the code is now much simpler. The state, as you understand from the above description, is eventually consistent with a last-config-win semantics (where last means the configuration with the greater epoch).",1385122389

After dismissing them first, the author comes around and ends up giving the protesters too much credit in my view. I read the protesters&#x27; arguments exposed back then and I couldn&#x27;t make much sense out of those. Yes, things may be wrong as they are and some change is perceived as necessary to avoid the collapse of social order, and for that I also agree that a critical mass of people is needed, which means that the change proponents are in need for as much adherents as they can get, but to crown fools is dangerous.",1385122020

Please quit giving Upworthy titles to techniques or tools I will never, ever want to use any part of in practice.  When I make something for fun or to try something novel, I still use the best techniques I find suitable for the problem.  If it&#x27;s really a pedagogical tool, it would have comments, built up examples, and conclusions about the paradigm in light of what was learned in the implementation.  This is utter nonsense that reminds me of doing random things in middle school when it was quite plausible that any information was valuable information in light of a relative lack of experience to draw upon.",1385121953
6780322,comment,6778754,6780244,5,0,larsberg,,,"> Fascinating stuff, though I do not what IRs are used by the modern \n> compilers like LLVM, GHC, Java, .Net?<p>There are a couple of things going on with CPS as implemented in this style of compilers that make it particularly nice for writing optimization passes:<p>1) There are only function calls (&quot;throws&quot;) and no returns. Though there&#x27;s no theoretical reduction in the stuff you have to track (since what is a direct-style return is now a throw to the rest of the program starting at the return point), there&#x27;s a huge reduction in in the complexity of your optimizations because you&#x27;re not tracking the extra thing. For some examples, you can look in the Manticore codebase where even simple optimizations like contraction and let-floating are implemented in both our early direct-style IR (BOM) and our CPS-style IR (CPS). The latter is gobs more readable, and there&#x27;s no way at all I&#x27;d be willing to port most of the harder optimizations like reflow-informed higher-order inlining or useless variable elimination to BOM.<p>2) IRs are cheap in languages like lisp and ML. So you write optimizations as a tree-to-tree transformation (micro-optimization passes). This style makes it much easier to enforce invariants. If you look at the internals of most compilers written in C++, you&#x27;ll see far fewer copies of the IR made and a whole bunch of staged state in the object that&#x27;s only valid at certain points in the compilation process (e.g., symbols fully resolved only after phase 2b, but possibly invalid for a short time during optimization 3d unless you call function F3d_resolve_symbol...). Just CPS&#x27;ing the representation of a C++ compiler without also making it easy to write your optimization passes as efficient tree-to-tree transformations will not buy you much, IMO.",1385121907

5464947,comment,5463210,5463210,31,0,Udo,,,"Another question is, of course, if straight dating can be fixed at all. After short stints on all the major dating websites, and of course trying to date in the real world, I've come to believe that the basic expectations people have can't really be satisfied, mostly by virtue of mathematics.<p>The following is a male perspective, but I think the observations should be on par for the other side as well:<p>First, there is supply and demand. There are not a lot of available women around (once you exclude the spam accounts), and that may very well be in large part due to Hollywood expectations. There are, however, a lot of men. That fact alone means that for most men, this won't work out at all. Once you get past a certain age (say 30), this mirrors the situation of the physical world <i>exactly</i>. At this point, it's a game of playing musical chairs that a lot of us simply can't win. But it only gets worse.<p>While most of the female profiles portray fundamentally damaged people, the men are overwhelmingly fit, handsome, and great in general. This could mean that women are just more honest in filling out these profiles, but it could also mean that women only join online dating sites <i>if they have absolutely no other alternative left</i>, whereas men <i>create profiles as a matter of course</i>.<p>So being me, I can't begin to compete with the other guys on attractiveness, or money, or general awesomeness. Not only that, I'm so vastly outnumbered it's not even funny. And the very limited resource we're competing on seems to be mostly reluctant, frustrated women who hate being on the site in the first place.<p>And in what I can only assume is a typical pattern, I meet exponentially more women AFK than online. Now if it continually isn't working out in meatspace, there is really no reason to assume it's going to be any different if the introduction was through a website. If anything, online-induced meetups are vastly more awkward. At least if you meet organically, it can always be in a friendly non-committal social context. When you meet online dates, it <i>has to be</i> about dating.<p>I don't think this is fixable. I'm not sure <i>it should be</i> fixable. There are plenty of people who still profit from online dating, but it doesn't really provide any discernable advantages for people who are already at a disadvantage. The perception that there <i>must</i> be someone out there for every single one of us is also a Hollywood myth.<p>In fact the only reason I can conceive where online dating makes sense is for attractive people who just don't get to meet a lot of potential partners in their daily lives. Now, that's not a small market. It may even be the majority of cases. But it took me a while to figure out that there is not a lot online dating can do for you if you don't belong to that group.<p>Having friends make your advertising for you doesn't change these mechanics. Of course it might improve the quality of the experience for the above-mentioned privileged group, but at the end of the day I'll have exactly the same odds as on any other dating site. To some degree, all dating sites (even those genuinely interested in making online dating not suck) capitalize on the Hollywood illusion that somewhere out there is my reasonably perfect match. They're playing on the assumption that everyone is dateable, and they in fact have to deceive you into thinking that the world of dating is not as depressing as it actually is.<p>Online dating works well for people who are already likely to be successful at dating AFK. For these people, online dating could probably be optimized. For others, probably not.",1364637239

5464939,comment,5464708,5464858,4,0,jcr,,,"Thanks for the input. Great points.<p>The flagging system on HN shares some similar aspects to the ones you\nmentioned (congrats on 250K active users!), but in many ways, it's a\ncompletely different system and has a slightly different intent. It only\ntakes a few flags from established users for new submission to be marked\n[dead] and invisible to most people, save those who have ""show dead""\nenabled in their profile. In this sense, HN flagging is designed to\ncrowd-source the task of removing spam, abuse, and off-topic material\nfrom the site.<p>Essentially, flagging is community cleanup, and it's the reason why the\nflag link is so prominent... --You probably remember when the front page\ndidn't have flag links. For a long time, only the /newest page had\neasily accessible 'flag' links. The change of putting 'flag' links on\nthe front page was made because junk kept getting up-voted onto the\nfront page, and since most people didn't know how to flag (by visiting\nthe 'link' link), the result was discussions about inappropriateness.<p>Flags on HN work differently than what you described. If\nyou flag something and it gets flagged by enough other people (tempered\nby anti-abuse ring flag/vote detection) to be marked [dead], then it was\na ""good"" flag. Similarly, if you flag something and <i>not</i> enough others\nflag it to become [dead], then it was a ""bad"" flag. The more ""good""\nflags you make, the more weight is given to them, and of course, the\nmore ""bad"" flags you make, the less weight is given to them.<p>(NOTE: Above I'm paraphrasing something pg posted eons ago, and I can't\nfind the link, so I might not have the details perfect, and the details\nmay have changed since then.)<p>Also, flags reduce rank in the HN sorting, but exactly how flags reduce\nrank is undisclosed (contra-factor --see pg's second post here):<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1781417"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1781417</a><p>If you flag something, and it does not go [dead], your flag still has\nsome effect, but the details of whether said flag is ""good"" or ""bad"" are\nunknown. All I can say for sure is if something is highly up-voted, and\nalso heavily flagged (i.e. <i>contro</i>versial), it sinks down the ranking\nand off the front page very quickly even if it is never marked [dead].<p>It's a very clever design, reduces the workload on mods/admins, and\nenables you to do some other interesting stuff...<p>Most of the details are not public, but I'd bet PG uses the good/bad\nratio to determine things like the per-user threshold value where\nflagging is disabled for a user. I also suspect it would take some other\ncount and/or good/bad threshold of flags per-submission or per-post for\nadmins/moderators to be bothered with any kind of alert. Why bother the\nmods/admin when enough known-good users have flagged it to [dead]?\nThese two points are pure speculation on my part, but having the\ngood/bad flag ratio per-user allows you to lighten the workload on\nmods/admins.<p>Of course, pg not elaborate on the anti-abuse code, and I sincerely\ndoubt he will neither confirm nor deny anything I've said publicly\nbecause he just can't without jeopardizing the effectiveness of his\nanti-abuse code. (Yes, I'm intentionally giving him an out).<p>On the other hand, having PG provide a bit more instruction on what he\nwants flagged could be really useful to the users watching the /newest\nqueue, prevent well-intentioned folks from unnecessarily triggering the\nabusive-flagger threshold, and at the same time, help improve the\nquality on HN.",1364637093

A tiny minority of people rake in money on ads, which frees up the vast majority of engineers to work on other stuff. AdWords and AdSense scale, they simply don't need an army of employees to maintain them, Google doesn't need 15,000 employees all working on ad serving.<p>Like the vast vast vast majority of all consumer facing internet businesses ever created since the dawn of the Web, Google was created to do something: Search, without any clear business plan about how to make money. Most Web businesses do not charge end user fees, they are founded to get users, and either make money from ads, or get acquired by those that do.<p>Facebook: Ads. Twitter: Ads. Yahoo: Ads. New York Times? Ads. You really think the journalists at the New York Times view themselves as working at an advertising company because that's the only way they can get paid? You think it's accurate to describe the New York Times as an Ad Agency?<p>Much rarer do we see people saying ""Facebook is just an ad company"" in forums, this charge is always lobbed at Google, which says to me that there's some intellectual dishonesty going on, people with an axe to grind.<p>Google spent nearly $7 billion on R&D in 2013. Most of this spending is targeted not at ads, but in trying to develop other lines of business with diversified revenue sources. Larry Page is not an idiot, he sees that relying on ads for 97% of your revenue is a risky proposition. It just turns out to be a hard problem to get people to pay for content now, even on mobile you can see prices being driven down to free + freemium. Unless Google wants to be an Enterprise company like Oracle (a market where people have a proven track record of throwing money at stuff), it's at the mercy of what people are willing to do, and as shown over and over again, people like get stuff for free if paid for by others (ads).<p>Even for HBO and some other channels, the majority of media people consume, even that on ""for pay"" cable TV is still funded by commercial ads.

5464919,comment,5462515,5462515,1,0,abhinavsingh,,,"All the best for your hunt, but here are some bare facts you must consider:<p>1) A startup hiring a fresher from a foreign country to work on their multi-million dollar vision is going to be a rarity. Imagine, why would someone hire a fresh talent from foreign land while they can very well find one in their local area. What specialty do you have to offer in particular?<p>2) Instamovie, SSH hacking, Impressive github projects list isn't really going to be a criteria for any startup to hire you. For most companies these points in your portfolio only mean that you are worth a talk. Also early stage startups need talent to come in and start contributing from day 1. They really don't want to hire and invest in nurturing someone. Thus, until unless one of your projects have similarity with what startup is trying to do, they are just some points in your CV.<p>3) Over the years, I have seen a number of my colleagues who also wanted to work in the valley (for very same reasons as you stated) wasting their energies behind finding a gateway to the valley. It's totally not worth the (dedicated) effort because, even if a startup that is sponsoring Visa hires you, getting through the Visa process can take significant time. Process of H1B Visa starts in April and within 1 month all Visa slots get exhausted. If you are lucky to get your visa processed within this cycle, you will have to wait atleast until October for Visa process to complete. If you are unlucky and your Visa application is not entertained this April, all you can do is wait until next April. Till then you can only work for the company from India (or visit on a B1 visa). B1 visa and working remotely, both again seems like a rarity for a startup.<p>So until everything falls in place by itself, your best bet for a ticket to valley would be:<p>a) Go for MS/Phd and follow the path as someone explained<p>b) Join a company in India, gain significant experience for an year or so, then try your luck again. With real world corporate experience behind, you will stand a better chance of getting hired by a startup abroad.<p>Just my 2 cents. All the best again.",1364635911

In all other ways, yes - you get to pay an price that's averaged over a reasonably large peer group that you just happen to fall into. That's how insurances work: They redistribute risk. They protect you from extreme outcomes by charging a low, steady price. All in all, you usually pay more than you get out and only a few actually benefit financially.

5464905,comment,5464880,5464880,1,0,lsiebert,,,"native apps will continue to be built so long as there are performance benefits, or increased access to native functionality, or finer grained control over UI or other benefits available to native applications. As I recall (I wasn't an owner of the original Iphone myself) it wasn't until a second version of iOS that an App store and third party native apps were allowed.<p>How could you have a web app that interacts with a device without a native layer at some level? At some level, you have to have a native application, though a company could make their stack directly compatible with web applications.<p>That said, I think you are going to continue to see people developing frameworks like Phonegap, because the idea of developing once has a variety of advantages for developers, and I/O is going to be the limiter on many processes.",1364635021

5464902,comment,5464880,5464880,3,0,beryllium,,,"No. Native apps won't die.<p>There seems to be an ebb and flow between ""thin client"" and ""thick client"" computing. Right now we're leaning heavily toward the ""thin client"" realm, with the emphasis on ""Cloud this"" and ""Web that""; however, it's entirely possible that something will happen to bring that remote compute capacity back to the local device for the sake of efficiency.<p>And even now, there are reasons to compute locally in a native language instead of remotely via an abstraction. Some of those reasons (speed, primarily) are beginning to be mitigated by new technologies, but the reasons will likely always exist for why a native app can be a better solution than a thin client style implementation.<p>Probably what we'll see is an emphasis on APIs and intercommunication - this gives companies the power to do a lot of logic server-side, and just roll native apps for things that are difficult to do on the server. Implementations like Dropbox, Evernote, Wunderlist, and Netflix are good examples of this bridge between philosophies.",1364634923

5464899,comment,5463210,5464818,6,0,insickness,,,"Agreed. I liked the article until he got to the proposed solution. Part of why I like online dating is that my friends are NOT involved. I can take as many shots at finding someone I like without the problematic repercussions of complex social networks (both online and off) where every swing and a miss could come back to haunt me. Whenever you date a friend of a friend, there is always the possibility of fallout. OKCupid without a social network allows me to break free of the constraints of involving my friends. Making OKCupid social turns it back into a burden. Your ""friends"" online (most of who are not friends, but acquaintances by the way) will feel obliged to say nice things about you. No one will say the bad things which may be true. And your romantic prospects will know this. I like the idea of an online wingman, whom I could exchange tips with, but the idea of a group date? No way. If I'm not into a girl I make a quick exit on the date. No harm, no foul.",1364634701

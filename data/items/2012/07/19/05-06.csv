Use a metronome and master each exercise. Start slow and work your way up.<p>2. Learn music theory, I'd burn through Mark Levine's 'The Jazz Piano' book, don't skip anything in that book including the little excerpts of songs.<p>3. Learn your favourite songs by ear (after you learn your favourites be diverse and learn other genres by ear), and pick one great musician you like to study to death. Learn all their songs by ear, every single note in every single solo etc.<p>If you want to learn piano quickly then make sure you practice everyday for a long time deliberately. If you want to learn piano extremely quickly then find a really good teacher and take lessons, often teachers are invaluable until you get to the point where you can give good self feedback.",1342677454

4264645,comment,4264180,4264595,4,0,enjo,,,"The more interesting debate is about overall health outcomes. Even the most ardent low-cholestrol folks are forced to admit that this link between higher LDL (particularly the big ""fluffy"" stuff) and heart disease exists.<p>There are two really interesting things, however.<p>1. The link between dietary saturated fats and increased LDL isn't nearly as strong as those earlier studies suggest. This is certainly supported by my own anecdotal evidence: My LDL levels went way down when I moved to a higher fat diet.<p>2. Some studies have suggested that controlling for all natural deaths that OUTCOMES on higher fat diets are better, meaning people on those diets tend to live longer. It appears that cancer rates are reduced for those eating higher saturated fat diets for one thing.<p>This is all outlined in ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"", and there is a wealth of study to support the idea.<p>I recently was seated with a prominent nutrition researcher at a local university. His take was interesting. Essentially he laid out why these studies are very difficult (as your cited book did). He said there are two clear things that comes up in research time and time again:<p>- Many preservatives, particularly the high sodium nightmares found in processed foods, are pretty bad for you.\n- Sugar is the devil. Studies have suggested time and time again that it's sugar that is responsible for elevated LDL levels. Worse yet sugar promotes higher levels of very dense LDL which is a huge risk factor for heart disease.<p>He recommends a whole food diet. Basically don't worry so much about what your eating and more about how fresh it is. The shorter the time between something living and the time you eat it the better. The fewer steps it takes for something to be prepared the better.<p>Calories still count of course, but I've essentially been following that idea for awhile. I eat more fruits and vegetables and I've drastically cut my sugar intake. I eat more steak and pizza (made from high quality and fresh ingredients) than the ADA would like. My blood chemistry levels have been amazing ever since.",1342677353

Willet, M.D., who writes in ""Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy"" (co-developed with the Harvard School of Public Health):<p>""There's no question that two types of fat -- saturated fat, the kind that's abundant in whole milk or red meat, and trans fats, which are found in many margarines and vegetable shortenings -- contribute to the artery-clogging process that leads to heart disease, stroke, and other problems...monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in olive oil and other vegetable oils, nuts, whole grains, other plant products, and fish -- are good for your heart.... Our bottom line is this: It is perfectly fine to get more than 30 percent of your daily calories from fats as long as most of those fats are unsaturated.""<p>""The term saturated means that the carbon atoms in a chain hold as many hydrogen atoms as they can...saturated fats come in gradations of bad...butter and other dairy products most strongly increase LDL (bad) cholesterol. Those in beef fat aren't quite as powerful at boosting LDL and those in chocolate and cocoa butter have an even smaller impact.""<p>HDL and LDL are lipoproteins: ""...fats must somehow get from your digestive system to your cells...like oil and water, fats and blood don't mix. If your intestines or liver simply dumped digested fats into your blood, they would congeal into unusable globs. Instead fat is packaged into protein-covered particles that mix easily with blood and flow with it. These tiny particles, called lipoproteins (lipid plus protein), contain some cholesterol to help stabilize the particles.<p>""Lipoproteins are generally classified by the balance of fat and protein they contain. Those with a little fat and a lot of protein are heavier and more dense than the lighter, fluffier, and less dense particles that are more fat than protein. The proteins also act like address labels that help the body route fat-filled particles to specific destinations.<p>""LDL is often referred to as the bad cholesterol...they can end up inside cells that line blood vessels. Once there, LDL is attacked by highly reactive free radicals and transformed into oxidized LDL. Oxidized LDL can damage the artery lining and kick off a cascade of reactions that clog the artery and set the scene for artery-blocking blood clots.<p>""In contrast, HDL particles sponge up excess cholesterol from the lining of blood vessels and elsewhere and carry it to the liver for disposal.""<p>He goes on to list several studies: Ancil Keys' 1956 international survey called the Seven Countries Study which found a strong link between saturated fat and heart disease; the Framingham Heart Study, which identified high levels of cholesterol as linked to impending heart disease; the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (both very large cohort studies); the Lyon Diet Heart Study; and others. ""In the 1950s and 1960s, dozens of carefully controlled feeding studies among small groups of volunteers showed conclusively that when saturated fat replaced carbohydrate in the diet, total cholesterol levels in the blood rose....""<p>The book also talks about the challenges of practical, large-scale studies of nutrition ""in the wild"": it's not easy to track and correlate people's eating habits over decades, for any number of reasons.",1342675769

Part of the problem is that there is this stereotype of the tech ""nerd"" who is socially awkward, doesn't shower, works 70+ hours a week. That serves as a roadblock for guys to get into tech as well, but it's far easier for guys to overcome it than women. The fact that women are much less likely to find that stereotype desirable is used as a reinforcement of the notion that ""girls just aren't well suited to the tech lifestyle"". But the ""tech lifestyle"" is not an absolute, it's just a semi-arbitrary tradition. And it forms the core of just as much of an ""old boy's club"" as, say, traditions of cigars, scotch, and golf do in other activities. Or, more so, traditions of strip clubs and casual acceptance of pornographic representations of women, which is also a thing in many corners of tech.<p>Self-reinforcing stereotypes are part of the problem.

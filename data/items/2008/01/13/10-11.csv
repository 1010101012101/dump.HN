Often I think people like these sites as they appear to be amateur and not run by some slick corporate",1200221168

He realised that to be a ""me to"" wasn't going to work and so his model was to offer a completely free dating site and make money from advertising. Whilst others obsess with creating great design and how cool they are, this guy just created something that works. I think rather than being negative towards him, we should learn a lesson from him.<p>On some of the comments below regarding shady tactics, I can't speak for this as I don't know anything about the company.  If this is the case, then it's not great, but from Rockerfeller to Steve Jobs this has sometimes been the way of it.  I think if we can take some lessons from the good side - ie quick to market, novel approach to making money, and apply them to what we are doing ourselves then that's a good thing",1200221101

I wouldn't underestimate Markus - running a site with 300MM page views per month single handedly is pretty impressive.<p>One quick observation: it's not an accident that some of the ugliest websites on the internet (MySpace, Craigslist) are also the most popular.",1200221065

The clean, uncluttered design appeals to the 'elite', but the masses just have different taste in things.

97808,comment,97625,97778,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"That's <i>the point</i>. It's inevitable because we're human, we can't remember hundreds of different passwords. Why not allow the user the connivence of logging in once using a single password, and at the same time improve the overall security?<p>With OpenID, your password is only ever entered in <i>one place</i>: the OpenID provider's login page. When another site wishes to authenticate you it redirects you to your provider where you enter your password then get redirected back to the original site along with a token proving you have authenticated and granted authorization to the site.<p>The most important thing is that you use a provider that you <i>trust</i>.<p>A good OpenID provider can actually help prevent phishing and identity theft. For example, myopenid.com (and probably others) lets you select a personalized image that is displayed whenever you're prompted for your password (much like Bank of America and other banks' ""SiteKey"") and you're supposed to train yourself to never enter your password unless you see the correct image, to prevent phishing (though most of us are smart enough to look at the URL too). They also provide a comprehensive log of every site which has authenticated using your account, so if your password has been compromised it is <i>very</i> easy to find out.<p>By the way, OpenID doesn't require you authenticate to your provider with a password. It could be done via a SecurID token, or even biometrics. Passwords just happen to be the simplest and most common method.",1200220548

Sorry for any confusion.<p>> <i>If epistemological state means anything at all ...</i><p>It is clear (to me, anyway) that by ""epistemological state"" Yudkowsky means ""state of beliefs and knowledge"" rather than what you say is the only thing it can possibly mean. Why do you think the only thing it could mean is what you state?<p>(I think he should have said ""epistemic"" rather than ""epistemological"".)<p>> <i>If EY had meant ... then maybe he should have spelled all that out</i><p>Maybe. But what he wrote was pretty long already, and ""since I am running on corrupted hardware"" (which is what EY <i>did</i> write) amounts to much the same thing. There's nothing a writer can do to guarantee that every single reader will understand correctly.<p>> <i>I reassert that very little new was said in this article</i><p>So you do. But you're reading only a portion of it; you make claims about its overall purpose which are clearly contradicted by the article itself (hint 1: ""to me this seems like a dodge""; hint 2: ""I now move on to my main point"", followed by a statement of that point which is <i>not</i> anything like ""how can I best respond to trolley problems?"" or ""our robotic overlords will be vastly superior to ourselves""); you ignore large parts of it altogether. Why should anyone care whether, treating it thus, you find anything new in it?<p>> <i>and what was said was wrapped in a ton of verbiage</i><p>Well, yes, Yudkowsky is not the most concise writer in the world. I think that may be partly because he's found that being terser gets him misinterpreted more often. From your consistently inaccurate paraphrases and summaries here, it seems to me that his main problem probably wasn't excess verbosity.<p>> <i>that does not seem to jibe with what he actually says: ...</i><p>Situations <i>where you're in the sort of epistemic position described in trolley problems</i> are very rare. Situations <i>where you can, and maybe should, harm some people to benefit others</i> are not so rare.<p>I dare say there are ways in which a superintelligence could ""fold all the remaining meat-machines into itself"". It's not so clear that any of them would result in there being a superintelligence which is a ""version of"" any of those meat-machines.<p>I neither know nor care exactly what your attitude to super AIs is.

2088613,comment,2087267,2087267,0,0,amalcon,,,"This is a good point if you make the assumption that people tend to accumulate wealth as they age as a rule.  I think this is likely, but it has not been established as a general proposition.<p>The shapes of individual ""wealth curves"" will not necessarily be identical.  Here are a few examples to consider:<p>- A person who is raised in a middle-class home, and has basically the life story in the blog post will have a curve similar to that one.<p>- A person who is raised in a poor home, is unable to afford college even with loans, and makes a few bad economic decisions early on, though not so bad that he cannot pay for them, will have a similar-looking debt event, followed by little change for the rest of his life.<p>- A person who is raised in a wealthy home, goes to college without needing loans, and is taught from an early age the value of savings and investment will have a much steeper exponential curve, and a much flatter ""retirement decline"".<p>- A person who is raised in a poor home, is unable to afford college even with loans, and makes catastrophic economic decisions will likely either declare bankruptcy or end up in prison.  Either event resets wealth accumulation to an unspecified negative value (to account for the stigma and reduced access to various opportunities), yielding a significantly different curve.<p>- A person who is raised in a rich home, with a trust fund, but whose trust fund was invested in real estate and Bernie Madoff.<p>- A person living the Equalland scenario encounters a catastrophic financial event at some point (illness, crime, failure of an over-leveraged investment such as a home) and is driven considerably into debt.  Servicing that debt will require either a significant portion of income thereafter or bankruptcy.<p>- A person living the Equalland scenario, except that his chosen field of education is overproduced in his generation, will have a similar curve to the fourth scenario above.  The education debt does not necessarily produce benefits thereafter.<p>I do think the Equalland scenario is likely to be most common, but I recognize that my suspicions are likely influenced by the fact that it is the most common scenario amongst my peers.  I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that it is the overwhelmingly most common scenario in general, especially with so many different scenarios resulting in a net wealth loss over the course of a person's life.",1294671322

Most bigger companies can't build Dropbox because to release a product like Dropbox one has to run a gauntlet of middle managers, and it's hard to get a roomful of software professionals to sign on to something that (a) is difficult to build and requires a lot of painstaking attention to detail, yet (b) can be described in three sentences.<p>It's just hard to talk about a simple, elegant mission in those ubiquitous meetings. People ask how the project is going, and you have three things you can say:<p>A) ""No, the folder doesn't sync yet.""<p>B) ""Yes, the folder syncs.""<p>C) ""No, the folder doesn't sync because of this particular small issue with this obscure API call in this obscure library on this obscure version of Linux blah blah blah TECH TECH TECH yes I'm so sorry too much detail I will shut up now.""<p>So pretty much all you can do is smile serenely. This is a big strategic disadvantage. Even a medium-sized company features multiple projects. The projects fight for resources: people, budget, management attention. They may fight in a very friendly and even above-board way, the way siblings fight for attention, but they do fight. And the project that tacks on more and more requirements gets to claim more and more resources, because, hey, requirements are hard! Bigger checklists require bigger teams, and bigger teams require bigger budgets, and more management attention. Add features! Attach a marketing campaign! Bolt it on to a much larger brand!<p>I need to go read <i>Parkinson's Law</i> again.

2088592,comment,2088150,2088150,0,0,blasdel,,,"What's so funny about all this is that the distribution constraints of the App Store do not make it incompatible with the GPLv2. Having to pay Apple $99/year for keys is irrelevant, as is the signing of binaries that prevents redistribution between devices (and even if those were problems, there's jailbreaking).  Hell, it wouldn't violate the GPLv2 even if there was no way for users to get their code on the device at all (see TiVo, et. al.). It's unfortunate that all the early discussion of this was laser-focused on the irrelevant DRM.<p>Rémi's argument is that the Apple Store Terms & Conditions constrain your usage rights — <i>""YOU SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO USE THE PRODUCTS ONLY FOR PERSONAL, NONCOMMERCIAL USE.""</i> — and downstream authors/distributors are not allowed to <i>""impose any further restrictions""</i> beyond the GPL.<p>Rémi is technically correct (the best kind of correct!) that the App Store terms are in conflict with the GPL. The clause in question isn't just for apps, its basic purpose is that purchasing a song or movie from Apple doesn't give you public performance rights to it. Apple could pay their lawyers to bloat out the whole usage section so that it'd be difficult for Rémi to pick a fight over it, but they probably won't.<p>But if people are going to pick fights over minor unenforceable EULA terms, they're going to find them everywhere they look. I mean for fuck's sake you also agree that you will not use iPhone software in the operation of nuclear facilities or for aircraft navigation, like in a great many EULAs. If some ideologue really wants to burn it all down they could probably find a ton of high-profile but ultimately pointless technical GPL violations in this vein.<p>Wherever a fight is sought it will be found.

In closed ecosystems the GPL's copyleft clauses make the code hard to use (there are server based loopholes). I think the unwieldiness of the GPL in closed environments is a net win because it creates incentives to moving to more open systems.\nThe FSF / GPL were started in an era where the PC environment was similar to the mobile environments of today. Over the period of their existence they have contributed to pushing the world in a direction where developer tools are freely available and the idea of spare time hacking is no longer a fantasy. I am hopeful that someone will create some mobile software under the GPL which is so useful that it creates the wedge required to open the mobile app landscape such that there are no restrictions on what languages are used to develop and how the apps get deployed.<p>In short its not the GPL thats broken here, its the closed nature of the system in question (iOS).

Design by committee\n2. Winners are determined by relationships and lock-in\n3. Educators don't care about finding the best, just good enough\n4. Great developers don't want to work in this sector<p>The first should be obvious.  Anything run by government tends towards design by committee, and educational software almost tries to be bad in this way.<p>The second is true of other sectors, but it is especially true in education.  Intermediate Units (I work in PA) and school districts don't try to work together by default.  Even at the top, deals are done by who knows who or who hates who.  And, the enormous cost of switching products for the large systems creates a lock-in environment.  People will say/promise anything to get a sale, because they know they will <i>really</i> have to screw up to lose customers.<p>Third, educators as a rule are afraid of technology or are at least more unaware than anyone here on HN.  They don't want to spend the time to learn; they want to spend whatever it takes to get the problem off their plate.  Remember, there are a great deal of people who went into education because of the vacation time.  Some people really care and work hard, but the percentage is lower than other industries, I think.<p>Finally, for all the reasons above, the greatest developers don't want to work in education.  The bosses are almost never developers; winners aren't determined by quality; most code is CRUD type code with lots of rules and exceptions from state law/procedure.<p>I get excited at the thought of change, which is why I stay.  I want to be part of that change.  But, on the low days change seems impossible, and I start thinking about other jobs.<p>One side note: why isn't there more OS in education?  This really bothers me, as it seems like a perfect scenario for it.  I'm thinking it goes back to points #2 and #3.  People want to pay for something now rather than funding something everyone shares.  If I could be part of the change in one way, this would be it (I'm looking for ways now).<p>EDIT: One more: pay.  Because most code is crud code, and because bosses aren't developers who can discern good from bad code, the perception is developers should be paid like teachers (or worse).  Not going to attract the great developers that way.  In the long run, all these software costs more to develop as a result of not hiring the best, but non-developer bosses can't understand that.",1294669811

He hooked me up with a New York Times interview, promoted the app on the Shopify blog, and there was even talk of buying the app from me. It was very, very basic, so I held out with the intention of fleshing out the feature set before considering selling it.<p>Six months went by, and I always seemed to find things to work on besides the app. Tobias even gave me a heads up about a competitor hitting the App Store. A few months after that, I found out that Shopify bought the competitor app for a pretty decent sum of money and made it official and free.<p>Had I worked on updates for my Shopify app instead of taking on the (fairly low-paying) clients I did, I probably would have made much more in sales than I did with client work, not to mention whatever price I could possibly have gotten from selling the app.<p>From the whole experience, I learned to manage my time, money, priorities, and client base in a way that allows me to give a lot more time to my own projects.",1294668959

I dont think anyone will argue with that.<p>> Then I copy-pasted that text into a website that revealed the hidden code my document was carrying. Here's a snippet:<p>The author is complaining about the HTML that comes out of Word. Is it really a huge surprise that something as complicated as Word formatting doesn't come out clean when converted?<p>>Word's idea of effective collaboration is its Track Changes feature, which makes an uneventful edit read like a color-coded transcript of an argument between the world's most narcissistic writer and the world's most pedantic and passive-aggressive copy editor.<p>First of all, this is incorrect. In the latest version of Word, if you have files stored at a shared location you can collaborate by both editing the file directly like in Google Docs. Second, the Track Changes feature is awesome. It does exactly what it's meant to do. Any changes you make while tracking is the displayed. I dont understand what ""world most pedantic and passive-aggressive copy editor"" has anything to do with the tool, rather than the editor himself.<p>> When I was writing a book, which required lots of alone time with a giant fileand lots of word-counting, which Microsoft is good atI stuck with Word.<p>Good for you.",1334203055

3830938,comment,3824908,3827443,5,0,10098,,,"It's like the industrial revolution. 
Long ago, things (like furniture) used to be made by craftsmen. They had to choose the materials, they had to get a picture of what the final product should look like. They used to work by hand, using only simple tools. It was hard. To become a skilled craftsman you had to be an apprentice for several years and learn a lot from your master.<p>Then came factories. Factories were super-effective, they produced a lot of things fast, and cheap too, and the level of skill required from a factory worker was in no way comparable to the skill of a proper craftsman.<p>I notice the same tendency in software development today - we, the software developers, are more similar to factory workers mindlessly sticking together parts than ""ninjas"" or ""rockstars"". Of course, the process of software development today is not entirely like a factory, but I sense it's moving towards there. And if it is, programmers will become something cheap and fungible. Imagine hiring illegal immigrants to write an iPhone app :)",1334202993

3830933,comment,3830350,3830572,10,0,chime,,,"Edit: I would appreciate some feedback/criticism instead of just down votes.<p>Let me explain it from the point of view of my users. My Chrome extension Plus Minus is quite popular ( <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pidkbnhjgdngcfcaikoocdanfijkgdli"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pidkbnhjgdngcfcaik...</a> ) and has some pretty hard-core users. Before the new change, my extension enabled users to mark posts as read (by collapsing them to one-line like most email UI), allowed you to control which circles showed up in your stream, and allowed numerous UI customizations (widen the stream, fade out the distracting right sidebar etc.)<p>Last night at 1am I updated my extension because a minor G+ change broke it. This morning I got flooded by notifications because the entire G+ UI changed and my extension broke again. G+ users installed Plus Minus because they truly felt G+ lacked some key features they found necessary. Plus Minus allowed hiding users from specific circles before G+ made a feature to adjust per-circle weight on the main stream. Try using the old or new G+ on a wide LCD and notice the large empty spaces where content should be.<p>Users do not care if I'm not using the official API or directly making changes to the DOM. They only care that my extension works well enough to improve their G+ experience. The philosophical question here is whether a website owner should encourage, discourage, or be ambivalent towards 3rd parties that improve a user's experience via client-side plugins. Everyone supports data-sharing via REST APIs, why not client-UI? Having a decent TOS for the UI API (don't hide ads, don't auto-post etc.) should help keep it respectable.<p>Reddit has RES which drastically improves the user experience. I haven't seen any official support for it, though neither have I seen any official opposition. What I have seen are users who go ecstatic when they find out about RES. Why doesn't reddit say how they feel about RES? Why don't they support it via official UI-handles? Why can't G+, FB, and other large sites do the same? Greasemonkey is too greasy. Why not officially encourage UI-improvements?<p>To put it bluntly, I think I can significantly improve on the G+ interface for a typical power-user because my incentives are vastly different from Google's. I don't want the big Hangout feature all up in my face, regardless of how amazing it is. I would rather see better/more content and filter it well. My 10k+ users feel the same. Should Google support me in any way? I don't expect them to but it would be nice.<p>Just like Mohamed, I spent a considerable amount of my personal time on a free extension to improve Google's social platform on Google's web browser. I have nothing to gain from this except kind words from strangers. Yet I feel I have helped G+ in a small way. When my extension does not work, I don't feel like browsing G+. My users have said the same thing to me repeatedly, publicly. So while 10k user is statistically negligible for Google, there are many extensions out there and extension-loving power-users make a significant portion of G+ early-adopters and frequent posters. Maybe Google no longer has to worry about early-adopters and is going straight for the masses. Again, not my right to judge. I'm just saying I spent a lot of effort on making a piece of software loved by tens of thousands and instantly, it's all gone to waste. Mohamed has 100x my users so I can understand his frustration.",1334202831

Additionally, I seriously doubt that Apple deliberately withheld the ability to use 8GB of RAM in software only to add it back later.

The problem is the collusion to raise prices in lock-step with other publishers.<p>The fact it was 9.99 or 14.99 or .99 isn't the problem, it's the fact the publishers colluded together to artificially raise prices.  If the price of ebooks was $1000 for some non-collusive(right word?) reason, the government would likely do little, but if the price of ebooks was $.05 by fiat, the government would step in.<p>It's a weird little world we live in, where the law recognizes multiple players in a market agreeing to artificial price fixing is bad for markets (and people, the actual reason for the law, the constitution doesn't care about markets), but at the same time grants strict monopoly rights to individual players in markets via patents and copyrights.",1334202082

Plain text is easily transferred, stored, parsed (with grep, or whatever you use for regular expressions), and, as a bonus, is easy for humans to look at. HTML helps with exactly none of those things. There's a reason that Erik S. Raymond emphasizes the power of plain text in <i>The Art of Unix Programming</i>. There's a reason that <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> has a chapter devoted to it. That's because plain text (more specifically plain ASCII text) is the closest thing we have to a universally understood format in computing. For something like e-mail, plain text is by far preferable to HTML, XML, JSON or some other structured format. You can't know that your target will have a parser for a structured format.

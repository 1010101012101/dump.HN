My twitter feed actually slowed down for a few days while everyone played with the new kid, only to pick right back up again.<p>The great thing about G+ is it seems to be popular with a few really interesting people I like to follow who post more to G+ than they did on Twitter.  However the lack of an API is preventing wider use and adoption.  Right now there is no convenient way to say integrate your own blog and while I actually use the twitter website a lot more now, 3rd party tools are still the most popular way for people to organize their multiple social networks together..<p>Of course I realize API integration has it's dark side too, mostly in the form of spammers, but it's a small price to pay for having a more active community.",1315324758

2966016,comment,2965497,2965919,0,0,stevelosh,,,"As much as I hate Vimscript, I don't think changing it to something else would work.<p>First, there's just a ridiculous amount of plugins and such already made.  Either
they'd need to be ported to the new interface (an <i>insane</i> amount of work) or the old
interface (Vimscript) would need to be maintained alongside the new.  Neither option
seems very practical.<p>Second, the main advantage of Vimscript is that it uses the same commands you use
every day while working with Vim.  `edit foo.py` in a Vim plugin does the same thing
as `:edit foo.py` in your daily routine.  This makes it really easy to get your feet
wet with Vim scripting -- in fact it makes it all but unavoidable.<p>Users learn tidbits of Vimscript while working, then start hacking stuff into their
.vimrc files, then move on to learning more and writing plugins.  It's a fairly
natural progression.<p>If you're going to change Vimscript to something else you have a couple of options,
all of which suck:<p>* Replace Vimscript in the daily routines with Lua/whatever.  Instead of typing `:e
  foo.py<cr>` I now type `:edit(""foo.py"")<cr>`.  No way this would ever work with
  Vim's community.<p>* Keep using Vimscript for daily commands, but use Lua when reading from files.  This
  loses the main advantage of Vimscript (which I think is a really important one),
  plus you now need to maintain two interfaces.",1315324674

Neither did I until it took away my creativity, imagination, enthusiasm and the ability to enjoy anything at all. Depression is not ""feeling sad"", it's an illness that makes you psychologically and <i>physically</i> sick, and you can't ""snap out of it"".<p>It may be that your friend isn't actually depressed and is just too lazy to work. But if she is in fact depressed, you're not doing her or anyone else any good by saying she should just ""suck it up and get on with her life"", because she can't, and being reminded of that is just going to make it worse. Depression feeds on itself. She may look fine to you, but you can't see if someone's depressed. We tend to hide what it's really like, this absolutely maddening feeling in our heads, the constant headaches, dizziness and mental and physical fatigue is not something you want to announce to the world. Nobody except my doctor knows about my depression.<p>I don't know about the statistics presented in the article, but I'm an example of the economic and social cost attributed to these illnesses. I've wasted a year of my life on depression, during which time I've been unable to work. Luckily, so far I've been able to live off my savings but if I'd been needing support from the state that cost would've doubled. I've never been the most social and outgoing person, but with the depression I became grumpy, uninterested, whiny and generally a little unpleasant to be around.",1315322461

Patents are NOT needed in the software industry to promote what is already a very fast moving environment. I prove this by showing something that is plain to everyone who is familiar with how tech companies work: they base their technology on incremental innovations, internal research, or open source. They do NOT read patent disclosures. We do not need to give out 20 year monopolies to incentivize patent disclosures by ""inventors"" to the public, because no one cares about these disclosures!!<p>The relevant numbers would be the proportion of companies that public patent disclosures have helped. For example, how many people were helped by Google publishing their PageRank algorithm (in its ""best form"")? Probably some were helped, but not a lot. And this is one of the BIGGEST and most HELPFUL examples of patents. How many were helped by amazon's 1-click patent disclosure?

Now, if one person who I trust is His follower says ""God told me X"", and then X is wrong, the theory would be disproved<p>> That would disprove if that particular person received words from God. It would not disprove if God talks to his followers.<p>Actually, it kind of would.  I mean, if I judged what was the word of God by what was reliable and true, you'd be right -- that would be circular and immune to any sort of experiment.  It would be saying ""things that come true come true."" And when I was first learning to pray, I did exactly that; I wrote things down, I tested them, I compared them with what I knew and checked them out.<p>But look, after years of this, I know what the voice of God sounds like.  It's pretty common for experienced Christians to say the same.  So if someone I knew to be experienced in such matters (or I myself) heard something that turned out to be false or worthless, I wouldn't just say, ""Well, I guess that wasn't God.""  I would have to rewrite major chunks of my worldview.<p>You have to understand, this experience is so real and constant for me (and for many Christians), that books have been written about what its absence is like.<p>But I want to be perfectly clear that this is a bit off the beaten path.  I think most Christians I have talked to have, once or twice in life, personally observed something that I think is empirically, clearly a miracle: being told specific information they couldn't know, gaining the temporary (or permanent) ability to speak or understand a language they don't know, experiencing very specific shared visions.  But let me be clear: <i>This isn't one of the ""important things.""</i>  Faith doesn't revolve around miracles, and isn't built on private revelation.  In fact, such things are so far from the center of our faith there is a debate in theology as to whether they occur at all(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessationism_versus_Continuationism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessationism_versus_Continuatio...</a>)!  Life as a Christian is about faithfulness to Jesus, not divine intervention.<p>I mean, such experiences generally aren't even used in apologetics -- they're too unverifiable, and too sacred anyway; you want to keep them private.  I do mention them when people ask if my faith has any current, rational foundation. But when one seriously wants to talk about the intellectual foundations of Christianity, we go to <i>big</i>, <i>well-documented</i> miracles, like Jesus' resurrection.<p>>> God is more interested in advancing His goals than impressing people.<p>> He sure has a lot of big homes and statues for someone who doesn't want to impress people.<p>A rather tame display for someone who can cause supernovas without breaking a sweat, don't you think?  And anyway, I doubt he actually commissioned all of those.  They seem to me pretty inconsistent with God's commands to devote our wealth to taking care of the poor.<p>But perhaps it would be better said that God impresses, but he isn't upset by people who aren't impressed.<p>Let me give you an example.  When Jesus was alive, he did a lot of miracles.  (I know you don't agree with that, but roll with it for a second -- I'm trying to show you, based on the story, how he feels about proving himself to people.)  Anyway, Jesus did a lot of miracles.  He raised people from the dead.  He healed incurable disease.  He restored birth defects.  He walked on water in a storm.  At one point, he fed 4,000 people on a few loaves of bread.  <i>Right after he finished that</i>, some folks came up to him and said, ""When will you give us a sign that you are really from God?""<p>And he said, ""Look, if you don't think what I've done so far counts, then you aren't going to get one.""<p>(Mt. 15:29 - 16:4)<p>It's like . . . if you've ever argued with a troll, you know there's no such thing as absolute proof.  People can explain away <i>anything</i>.  There were people who <i>watched Jesus do miracles</i> and didn't follow him.<p>So what do you do?  Well . . . you do pretty much what I'm doing right now with you.  You put the information out there.  And if they want to explain it away rather than thinking about it, that's on them.<p>I think God takes that approach, too.  There is no shortage of evidence that he is real and acts in history.  The content and history of the Bible, the historical fact of Jesus' resurrection, the experience of the modern church, and the origin of the universe -- those are the big ones.  But if you're determined not to believe in him, there's no such thing as proof.  People say, with Ebeneezer Scrooge, ""You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of underdone potato (or a space alien!)"".  They prefer to believe they are hallucinating over believing that God is speaking to them.<p>And that's <i>their</i> prerogative.<p>At the end of the day, I think such resistence isn't based on reason.  It's based on emotion.  If someone desperately doesn't <i>want</i> God to exist, nothing will prove it to them.  And even if God went so far out of his way as to make belief really unavoidable, what would that accomplish?  It's not like they'd hate him any less knowing for sure he was real.",1315321882

2965829,comment,2964008,2964008,1,0,euroclydon,,,"I think anything that brings value up the market will benefit consumers. Let me quote from Mark Mills of Forbes, where he explains that, although a tiny fraction of a percent of the U.S. population works in agriculture today versus 100 years ago, much of that population is now involved in food preparation.<p><i>Roughly a century ago when America had fewer than 100 million citizens, nearly 12 million worked on farms, a number that then comprised over 40 percent of the entire labor force.  Now barely three million people call themselves farmers, accounting for a shade over two percent of todays workforce.  Meanwhile, technology enabled a 600 percent growth in agricultural output.<p>Both in absolute and relative terms technology blew the lid off agricultural productivity, and crushed direct farm employment.  But, over that same century, somehow the American economy managed to generate enough wealth to create jobs for more than 100 million more workers.<p>Most of the new employment over the past century came from new services and new products that didnt exist in 1900  airlines and computing to name only two examples. It is worth noting that a lot of the new employment actually came from the same industry, food, as farming.  Its just that we count the jobs differently.  While barely two percent of the modern American workforce is in farming, over 15 percent work in the food industry.</i><p>What is the next step beyond food service?",1315321761

2965825,comment,2965479,2965763,2,0,yayadarsh,,,"No one is saying that HTML and CSS aren't with flaws.  They are the industry standard, supported by <i>all</i> modern browsers, which changes everything.  Similarly, you may prefer the syntax and philosophy of Lisp, but that doesn't change the fact that Java/C++ are far-and-wide the most popular languages used, and in many industrial applications -- industry standards.<p>The pro's for separating code and markup are thought to outweigh the cons, but there is nothing forcing anyone to adopt this standard.  As you may or may not know, re-usability and maintainability can go a long way when working with a large webpage.  If I am trying to massively overhaul my website while maintaining the same use-cases, the javascript is probably not going to change, but the HTML and CSS will, and herein lies the benefit of separation.<p>That being said, if for some reason you would prefer a button's behavior to be more apparent in it's markup, scripts can be used in-line with identical functionality.  If your concern is linking to an external document (which is also done as a step of <i>simplification</i> of large projects, not obfuscation) it is totally acceptable to style an HTML page from internal <style> tags.",1315321623

So, please don't believe me without additional supporting evidence.<p>However, what I took away from those classes was that gender was a very mutable 'invention' that Humans created through culture to systematically specialize labor in response to environmental forces.  Some cultures invented two-genders, aligned with biology, to succeeded in environments where two specialized gender roles were more advantageous.  However, other cultures of Humans invented several types of genders, and genders that crossed biology, to succeeded in different environments.<p>So, if those memories are even accurate, gender and gender roles in Humans are more aligned with the overarching systematic cultural forces than biology.  And, even if we consider biology, there is a lot of cross-over.  Humans are a very adaptive and mutable species.",1315321500

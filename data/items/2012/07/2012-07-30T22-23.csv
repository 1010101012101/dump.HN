4315127,comment,4312731,4313881,8,0,tripzilch,,,"> How about we just make a ""blacklist"" of these known bots, look up every user agent, and compare against the blacklist? So now every single request to your site has to do a substring match against every single term in this list. Depending on your site's implementation, this is probably <i>not trivial to do without taking some sort of performance hit</i>.<p>???! Excuse me? Are you programmers? Efficient substring matching is a solved problem. How many entries in that blacklist are you looking at then? Can't be more than a few thousand to catch 99.9% of the ones where a blacklist would work.<p>If done right it's easily faster than<p>> see if the client can execute Javascript.<p>because that requires a whole extra request roundtrip before detection. Also it's no longer true that bots don't use Javascript, the libraries are freely available.<p>It's also definitely faster than<p>> some sort of system that analyzes those clients and finds trends (for example, if they originate from a certain IP range)<p>> This is smarter than just matching substrings<p>No. It's smart to grab the 99.9% of bots with a blacklist of substrings, <i>most importantly</i> because it has a very very low false positive rate (unlike checking for JS support) because any human user that goes through the trouble of masking their UA as a known bot certainly knows to expect to get blocked here and there.<p>After that you can use more expensive checks, but at least you can bail out early with on the ""properly behaving"" bots with a really cheap string matching check (seriously why do you think that's an expensive operation--ever check how many MB/s GNU grep can process? just an example of how fast string matching can be, not suggesting to use grep in your project. Your blacklist is (relatively) fixed, you can use a trie or a bloomfilter it'll be faster than Apache parsing your HTTP headers)",1343688922

The key in such a system would be keeping users engaged in the site from the time they first start learning to the point that they are ready and qualified to get their first job.

      process(a)
    end.bind! do |b|
      process(b)
    end.bind! do |c|

I find the former a lot more readable, partly because the ""end"" keywords don't all pile up at the end, and especially if you try and do error handling (in the nested case the error handling ends up in reverse order!).<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/samstokes/deferrable_gratification#bind-for-when-one-thing-leads-to-another"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/samstokes/deferrable_gratification#bind-f...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad_Laws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad_Laws</a>",1343688582

Somewhere in the last decade they went from being the most feared tech company to one that is no longer even viewed as a competitive threat:<p><a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2011/googles-schmidt-microsoft-not-driving-consumer-revolution/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geekwire.com/2011/googles-schmidt-microsoft-not-d...</a><p>>> In past eras of technology, one company has ruled. Microsoft and IBM, for example. But now, Schmidt sees a gang of four companies providing the major consumer technology platforms<p>>>  Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.<p>It also doesn't help that they've seen many high-profile employee defects - many of whom are now working for Google. They haven't been <i></i>the place to be<i></i> (if you're an elite hacker) for quite some time.<p>If you look at the past focuses of all the different companies you'll find a pattern of Microsoft doing all the chasing - where they try to get their finger in every new market pie and mostly failing (besides XBOX). They tried to take on Google's Cash Cow with Bing, Apple's iPod with Zune/Kin, Amazon AWS with Azure - now they've had a complete rewrite of their Smart Phone OS to try compete with iOS/Android and still can only muster 1.3% Market Share (even after shelling $1B to Nokia) <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2012/chart-microsoft-nokia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geekwire.com/2012/chart-microsoft-nokia/</a><p>The only hurt they've been doing lately is to their only real partner, Nokia - after they Osbourned all of Nokia's WP7 products when announced earlier this year that NONE of the phones Nokia is selling will be able to run WP8 - with no release date when they have a device that will?! The only possible excuse for this madness is to see Nokia's sales and market value crashing so they can pick them up for a cheap buy later.<p>The re-imaging of Windows 8 are warning signs of desperate times for Microsoft, as they're trying to leverage their Desktop OS Monopoly to compete with the iPad - but at the cost of disrupting one of their primary Cash Cows and actually providing a worse UX for Desktop users. Win 8 does look pretty but it's frustrating to use! I'll still buy a Win8 promo licence but I'm waiting for the first ServicePack UX with improvements before I'll even consider the switch.<p>>> If you dig into any documentation from Microsoft that speaks about their vision you'll find that their model is based on a lot more than ""Smart Phone + Tablet"". It includes phone, tablet, laptop, PC, console, TV, desktop, server, and cloud. Think about that for a minute.<p>They can pack as many complex and numerous features in as many devices as they want, but if it doesn't appeal to end consumers it will be as good as their current efforts to date.

Just as these are not audited they are also  not nearly as likely to be benchmarked and tuned.<p>If there is a reason to serve static files out of script, that reason will be because of some positive reason (like convenience or the need for some particular flexibility) rather than some vague sense that using Apache is ""obsolete"".",1343687747

I worked at an ad network where one of the clients demanded we prove that the mouse had moved prior to ""clicking"" on one of their ads. No problem, we said, and most of the traffic passed  the test. The traffic had referrers, legit user agents, javascript, and they were triggering the mousemove and click events. Out of curiosity, we sent a fraction of traffic to a test page, wherein the actual page was displayed in a full window iframe, then blocked access until the user clicked, and tracked their mouse movements. Easy enough; annoying for a user, but not a deal breaker for most.<p>The user movement maps we ended up with were straight lines of randomly spaced dots with sudden acute corners. A human could not replicate the pattern with a ruler and a pen pad, and we certainly didn't expect 90% of our human users going for that client's sites to be sitting around with rulers and pen pads drawing lines of randomly spaced dots. We checked the testing code and ran a dozen tests, and we couldn't figure out how a human could replicate it on any browsing device. Our conclusion is that somebody bothered to program a bot that would replicate mouse movement and we accidentally broke it by blocking programmatic access to the page, so it couldn't find a link to click and went crazy.",1343687195

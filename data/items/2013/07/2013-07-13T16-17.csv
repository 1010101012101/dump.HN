We started the company out as a consulting venture because we couldn&#x27;t raise VC money. The launch of the SaaS platform coincided with the V2 of our GUI, and so we had a strong indication from the consulting that folks would pay, but it was quite relieving to actually see dollars coming in to our coffers.<p>>How many times did it take before you got it right?<p>I think it&#x27;s honestly still a work in progress. The first time I felt ok about asking someone to pay for our product was when I was comfortable using it myself and when I could see real value when positioning it to people. This was roughly a year after I started (I&#x27;m in my 3rd year now) because we didn&#x27;t get it right on the first iteration at all.<p>>What works for traction?<p>Content. We started doing Expert Q&A sessions that attract a lot of attendance, but they&#x27;re active traffic acquisition channels for us. Each presentation nets about 1000 views a month right now, so there&#x27;s a lot of value in continuing to develop that kind of high-quality content. I think people in your industry value expert commentary, so if you&#x27;re in a position to provide it, do it. (We are at $X,000,000 in revenue in a little over 3 years, bootstrapped, so I know it can be done).<p>>What promos work?<p>Promos usually don&#x27;t work. We&#x27;re not in PayPal land where your cost of acquisition can be $20 per customer. That&#x27;s insane. What works now is great content, syndicated effectively.<p>>What marketing tactics?<p>1) Great content<p>2) Speak at conferences<p>3) Charity (Not because it&#x27;s going to pay you back, but because people love the things you&#x27;re passionate about)<p>I think the best promotion/marketing advice I can give you is to be passionate about what you do and represent that passion with class. That&#x27;s the ticket to success, in any walk of life :).<p>TL;DR: Content Marketing + Syndication. People will buy your SaaS when it solves a problem you yourself experience daily.",1373734778

It was about 6 months in.<p>We started making a very general CI service, and it took 3 months to realize that we should refocus on web-apps only. At that time, we started to get a bit of traction: maybe 10ish customers were using it, and after a month we asked them to pay.<p>Most said they would, but for many, the service was too slow and it caused their tests to fail. So we spent another 6 weeks rewriting the backend to make Circle incredibly fast (we had been using t1.micros, we changed to huge machines with LXC, and many custom tweaks), and then our first paying customer, Zencoder, paid.<p>So we only got it slightly wrong once in this startup, but we had both fucked up a startup before, and learned a lot from it (mostly talk to your customers, and make sure what you&#x27;re building is something they really need and want).<p>For us, it wasn&#x27;t marketing/promo tactics at all, it was just to focus on a great product. Our biggest growth has come from word-of-mouth, and our biggest customers (eg Kickstarter, Shopify, a few more I can&#x27;t name) came in organically. We got a reputation as being best of breed, and spent a lot of time focusing on how to improve lives for customers.<p>Rather than thinking in terms of tactics/promos, I would focus on making sure that people want your product, and they want it so much they tell their friends (in our case, colleagues at meetups and over twitter). That&#x27;s long-term sustainable growth. (You certainly do need short-term growth tactics too, but its harder without the great product behind it).",1373734724

6037975,comment,6037537,6037721,1,0,niels_olson,,,"> Security is about systems<p>That should be the top comment. Having done force protection for an aircraft carrier before, during, and after 9/11, it&#x27;s all about systems. We involved nation-states in this. All our systems and all their systems. It took months if not years of planning, advance trips, meetings in SCIFs and prestaging assets to bring one of those into a foreign port. Lasers, standoff air defense, dolphins, guys in in cafes &quot;reading the paper&quot;. Training 2000 sailors on .50 cal, shotgun, 9 mm. Boat teams. Here&#x27;s us getting underway from Virginia a week after 9/11:<p><a href=""http://m.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2001-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2001-12</a><p>People with no dog in the fight, famously the older warrant and limited duty officers, guys who came up through the ranks for 30 years, would continuously poo-poo my plans. &quot;What if this....&quot; &quot;What if that...&quot;<p>Toward the end of my tour, the fleet force protection officer, a senior SEAL commander, drug my counterpart from another ship in, an old warrant officer who had been doing physical security since before I was born. The SEAL drilled our team on scenarios in front of this other guy for an hour. Then he turned to the warrant and said &quot;These guys might take the first hit, but I know what they&#x27;re going to do. I can count on them. I can plan around what they&#x27;ll do. I have no idea what your ship is going to do. Fix it.&quot;<p>Screw the what-iffers, but make sure you can annihilate their what if scenario twice before it ever comes to that. Take ownership of you defense. Take you job personally. Use the what-iffers for the cheap war gaming they offer, and then don&#x27;t worry about them.<p>Get everyone in your organization on board with your plan. Make sure you know who has the authority to pull which triggers, and make sure they&#x27;re available on the necessary timeline, or devolve that authority to people who are. But don&#x27;t let the intern have so much authority he can inadvertently start a war.<p>Know what your internal and external reporting requirements are, and <i>why</i>. For example, I&#x27;m willing to bet the security of gmail is considered a national security priority at this point. Even if no one in DC can do a damn thing about it. It&#x27;s been wargamed, and the Pentagon battle watch commander can get a googler with need-to-know on the phone in under a minute. If that googler doesn&#x27;t know that, he probably ought to have figured out why.",1373734672

6037932,comment,6037188,6037856,0,0,GuiA,,,"Jef Raskin, The Humane Interface, page 51:<p>&quot;BUTTONS THAT CHANGE IN THE NIGHT<p>Some aircraft have pushbuttons that contain  dot-matrix display used to change the legend that appears on the button. This change is done under the aircraft&#x27;s computer&#x27;s control so that the buttons can be relabeled on the fly. The advertising copy for one brand of these buttons made some human factors claims. or one thing, fewer buttons would be needed in the limited cockpit area. For another, avionics and other system changes could be effected without having to rewire the cockpit.<p>From the perspective of cognitive science, good labels enhance visibility. Assuming that the person choosing the labels bothers to test the wording, to make sure that the chosen labels are effective and unconfusing, it is, on the face of it, a good idea.<p>But more careful thinking reveals a number of potential pitfalls to the product: All legended buttons get obscured– by the very finger you are using–just as you are about to press them, obviating a last-second check that you are pressing the right button. But this is a minor problem, for normally you have looked at the legend before you press the button– if you have looked at all. (I am certainly not looking at the legends on the keycaps of my keyboard as I type this)<p>Then there is the deeper problem of the disappearing button. You want to enable, say, the manual controls on the cabin air conditioner. There is, you recall, a button labeled MANUAL AIR, but it is nowhere to be found. The reason is that it now says COMM BACKUP. You have to figure out how to get that button to light up the way it did before. Perhaps a switch or a button somewhere else changes the legends on the buttons. Or perhaps the legends are context sensitive and won&#x27;t allow you to change the air conditioning right now. Whatever the cause, when a button has variable legends, the button you want will perhaps have vanished because the system is in a different mode.<p>But the gravest problem has to do with habituation. Imagine the experienced pilot reaching up and pressing a button. The radio&#x27;s not working; something&#x27;s wrong. A communications problem: Time to enable COMM BACKUP. She jabs out expertly at the COMM BACKUP button. Click! Too bad. The copilot was adjusting the cabin temperature in response to a passenger complaint, and the buttons are now in climate control mode. The pilot has just achieved complete manual control over the air conditioning system.<p>Variable-legend buttons could be useful, for instance, if several people use the same console, each using it in such a way that the buttons do not change meaning for any one user. But this is a situation seldom encountered. Soft keys, whereby a display has changable legends that affect on-screen buttons or buttons adjacent to the display, have the same liability as do variable-legend buttons. A similar problem exists with the use of function buttons, labeled F1 through F11 on many computers. If their functions are unchanging, the labeling is mnemonic. If their functions change, you cannot use them automatically. In either case, they are a poor design.&quot;",1373733673

The jQuery docs explain it:<p>api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events<p>> Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time. By picking an element that is guaranteed to be present at the time the delegated event handler is attached, you can use delegated events to avoid the need to frequently attach and remove event handlers. This element could be the container element of a view in a Model-View-Controller design, for example, or document if the event handler wants to monitor all bubbling events in the document. The document element is available in the head of the document before loading any other HTML, so it is safe to attach events there without waiting for the document to be ready. ... In addition to their ability to handle events on descendant elements not yet created, another advantage of delegated events is their potential for much lower overhead when many elements must be monitored.",1373732703

Obviously it&#x27;s a question of whether a sperm cell carrying an X or Y chromosome gets into the egg, but both parties have a lot of biology involved between meiosis and fertilization that might impact that.<p>> Now I haven&#x27;t studied seriously biology but to change the meiosis of sperm cells to skew the odds seems more effective (and simple) than to have the egg cell select the sperm with the X or Y chromosome during the fertilization that is messy as it is. And if X and Y sperm cells were somehow different I think we may have found out.<p>X and Y sperm cells are different - one is carrying an X and the other is carrying a Y and these will therefore have different masses and probably some other characteristics will differ.  As female mammals tend to invest hugely more resources in the individual child, it&#x27;s more likely to be worthwhile to them to sacrifice some chance of conception to favor a particular gender.  Furthermore, if the child is more likely to stay with the female, the female is a better predictor of the environment the child will be raised in.  Since meiosis produces an X and Y cell inherently (it splits a cell with an X+Y in half, with one chromosome going each way) and furthermore happens well in advance of mating when the partner may not even be determined, it seems less likely that the cause for any pattern in SR would be manipulation of the ratio of X vs Y cells during meiosis.  Of course, biology surprises on occasion, I just think you&#x27;re making entirely unwarranted assumptions.",1373732543

Code written in the E programming language (<a href=""http://erights.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erights.org</a>) for example, is orders of magnitudes more easy to verify, simply due to forced encapsulation and that the semantics of it are much more obvious.",1373732123

6037836,comment,6037464,6037464,0,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"The largest reason why I would hesitate to use Perl in my startup would be the core philosophy of TIMTOWTDI (there is more than one way to do it).  Being able to write something multiple different ways leads to Perl being a lot easier to write than it is to read.  As a result code maintenance can become a huge headache due to someone not understanding the idioms used by the person who originally wrote the code.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this happen on a number of projects that I&#x27;ve worked with using Perl.  Typically a person wouldn&#x27;t be familiar with &quot;silver ball&quot; (Effective Perl Programming), would go off an write a large body of code which would be difficult to wade through.  This gets exacerbated by new coders not understanding how perl expects you to understand some of its idioms (like $_, @_, etc.) implicitly.  Because reading other people&#x27;s code is a great way to learn a language, this makes Perl a lot less approachable.<p>I think Ruby suffers from some of these problems to a certain degree as well.  I haven&#x27;t worked with Ruby professionally, but in the few times I&#x27;ve played around with it I&#x27;ve found myself spending a lot of time trying to figure out which looping construct I should use over another.<p>Python does have a leg up in this department.

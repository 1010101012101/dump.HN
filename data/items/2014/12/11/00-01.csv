Silicon Valley&#x27;s history, however, has little relevance to the discussion at hand.<p>You seem absolutely convinced that entrepreneurs can&#x27;t build successful companies without a certain kind of &quot;ecosystem&quot; in their city. It&#x27;s simply not true, but please don&#x27;t take my word for it.<p>If and when you leave Houston and come to an area with a great ecosystem, like the Bay Area, you&#x27;ll soon discover that despite the ecosystem, there are tons of entrepreneurs and wantrapreneurs who aren&#x27;t any better off. The only difference might be that instead of the excuses you&#x27;ve provided (&quot;there&#x27;s no ecosystem&quot;, &quot;the investors don&#x27;t invest in tech&quot;) you&#x27;ll hear a different set of excuses (&quot;I can&#x27;t find a co-founder&quot;, &quot;YC rejected me for the fifth time&quot;, &quot;the VCs won&#x27;t invest in my company&quot;).",1418259598

So many of these marketplaces have failed the past year, what reason should people have to trust Buttercoin or think that they are more secure than the likes of Mt. Gox? Being a funded marketplace just means that you are more than likely to be the target of hackers trying to prove a point. I&#x27;ve already lost a little bit this year because of various marketplace collapses.<p>What protections are in place for losses? What are you procedures for storing coins (hot wallets, cold wallets, etc)? Do you have a guarantee you are willing to publicly stick by? Has your marketplace been audited and verified by a third party security firm? How often will you undertake auditing of your marketplace to ensure that it remains secure and funds are safe? If customer coins are ever compromised, will you cover 100% of the losses?<p>I have a few BTC, I would be more than willing to try this out, if you were more forthcoming in regards to security and your guarantees. Being a funded marketplace, I would like to think you built a decent and secure environment for Buttercoin as well as got the site audited independently by a third party security firm who perhaps specialise in financial/marketplace scripts.<p>I am not trying to be cynical here, Buttercoin looks great, but you can understand given the losses I have endured the past year, that I am very very hesitant to trusting another marketplace and I assume there are many out there like me who have been burnt the last year. My trust in all coin marketplaces has been broken, I just need the public reassurance you will do things differently and your policies/procedures before I move any of my BTC.",1418258715

First of all, you could release a bookmarklet and browser plugins that would let people mark up websites for others to see. Each such mark would have its own associated discussions etc.<p>But we could go even further. We could source facts and debunkings of claims. We could in fact build a graph of dependencies between claims and give people a way to assess their truth value. In this way we could for example have a discussion of varios religious claims once and for all, and any visitor would see what other claims they depend on. I thought, for instance, that Coca Cola invented the modern image of Santa Claus as wearing red. I was wrong.<p>Snopes, Politifact, etc. could all be sources.

This paper introduces causal profiling, a novel profiling approach that not only indicates exactly where programmers should focus their optimization efforts, but also quantifies their potential impact. Causal profiling works by performing a series of performance experiments at runtime. These experiments quantify the impact of any potential optimization via virtual speedups, which emulate the effect of real speedups by slowing down concurrently-executing tasks. Causal profiling further departs from traditional profilers by identifying optimization  opportunities that increase throughput or reduce latency. We present COZ, a prototype causal profiler, and empirically demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness at guiding optimization efforts.",1418257344

Anonymity can solve some problems in research, but it will make other worse.<p>When people are anonymous, they ARE more likely to be truthful in their criticism.

No one likes to make enemies.<p>On the other hand, anonymity can pretty clearly bring out some of the worst in us. Some people feel little obligation to be fair or honest when their reputation isn&#x27;t on the line, and so you see people trying to knock down rivals, people they don&#x27;t like, or random strangers just for the &quot;thrill of the troll.&quot;<p>Imagine if every time you applied for a job your potential employer had access to anonymous feedback on your past work.

Even if, on technicalities, the states may not be very different, the perception is strong enough to scare people into California, a state that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have more than weather and inertia.<p>One of my posts is already linked here, by mwhite, and my perception hasn&#x27;t changed.

Then again, the old thinking (reinvented using fratty Young Republican types who get funded) is invading the Valley.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see that Boston is taking on Real Technology. That&#x27;s great. Honestly, if something can be run by Lucas Duplan or Evan Spiegel, it probably shouldn&#x27;t be done and it certainly shouldn&#x27;t be funded at the expense of something legitimate. All that said, one of my gripes with Real Technology (and with Boston) is that there tends to be a militant PhD Bigotry in it. I get that advanced degrees are more common than pigeons out there, but it&#x27;s a bit irksome to be treated like a junior just because one doesn&#x27;t have an doctoral degree.<p>I mean, look, I&#x27;m not without cognitive ability. If I weren&#x27;t a public figure, I could lie and say I was a Stanford PhD in CS and would easily pull it off. Almost everyone would believe me (except for Stanford CS graduates, who could call me out on campus specifics or professors). I have zero interest in lying about my background or history; my point is that I&#x27;m smart enough that I could get away with it and hold up. So the lack of a credential shouldn&#x27;t matter, yet I&#x27;ve had more than one Boston company (when interviewing with them, in the past) tell me that I wasn&#x27;t a <i>real</i> data scientist or a real quant because I didn&#x27;t have a PhD. Never mind that I am so much smarter than the person who set these little rules in place that I could claim that I invented the letter &quot;Q&quot; and they&#x27;d believe me.<p>Real Technology can afford PhD Bigotry now because there isn&#x27;t much of it and (unlike the consumer web space, which is mostly stupid and product-driven but takes more chances on people) it can be picky, so long as it doesn&#x27;t try to expand. But these academics and ex-academics need to realize that if they want to be relevant again instead of falling into another AI Winter, they&#x27;ve got to drop the pedigree bigotry.<p>Ok, that last rant has more to do with technology in general than with Boston. I guess I&#x27;m here to say that I&#x27;m very glad to see Boston&#x27;s high valuation applied to <i>substance</i> getting it some press. I want Boston&#x27;s tech scene to succeed.

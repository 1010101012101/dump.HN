He hasn't changed employers since, although he's changed divisions, and his employer has changed names a few times ;-) Of course, he started out as a lineman/installer, and he's now a senior consultant racking up 100K international frequent flyer miles per year.",1230533838

412723,comment,412439,412687,0,0,newt0311,,,"Having only a single auto-increment column with sharding is likely a bad idea to begin with. In most DBs, (not MySQL I think), the engine uses a specialized setup to hand out the next value in line globally so that while the auto-increment column will be unique, it will be slow. In MySQL, I think they use some sort of special table and mark the rows as they get used up (I could be wrong. I don't usually use MsSQL). Thus, on a MySQL DB, it is possible to get incorrect behavior when changing something in the middle of  transactions. So, adding in shards with auto-increment in MySQL could turn bad very quickly and very silently.",1230533142

They must be finessing the meaning of 'see'.<p>Who are these ""online financial service providers"" where my ""online banking credentials are stored""? They aren't named, but the wording suggests they are someone other than either Mint itself or my own financial institutions.

412712,comment,412700,412700,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"It does have a lot in common with one- except I am legally obligated to pay in because other people were conned. People are getting paid by new investors, and I guess the whole plan was kick started with people getting payments despite not paying in. The other striking thing is that the government has been siphoning off the excess investment for years, instead of saving it for when people need it.  The whole plan is about to get payment heavy, and I hope it changes soon before I have to pay much more in. I don't plan to be able to get anything out.<p>I really don't buy the author's assumption of infinite growth. Also, the comments on that site are completely batshit insane.

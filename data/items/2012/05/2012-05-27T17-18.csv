Possibly with a large subscription purchase, you'd save enough money that your customers would get a deal for coffee AND the paper while you up the revenue.<p>2. add breakfast! smoothies? Breakfast burritos? Those take time, are usually pretty healthy, and are highly portable.<p>3. send them a morning playlist??? like a new jazz/downtempo CD of their genre preference to get ready with while they wait? If I'm busy, which is what I'm going to have to be to use your service, I probably don't spend a lot of time getting new music.<p>4. have really really good looking delivery people. Nothings gonna make someone get ready faster and better in the morning than that. Hire college sororities/intramural soccer teams?<p>5. market yourself to startups that want their folks to come in before just getting free lunch--like a jumpstarter for their day. Maybe they'd pay a bit to see if you can get their engineers in by 9:30-10. 15-20 bucks for an extra hour or two of work sounds like a stellar rate for a top flight hacker...<p>Honestly though man, I'd use this as a vehicle to learn about starting up and not as the roadmap.

This might be the one time QR codes could work!. A Well placed QR code on the cap??<p>2) If you try to cut your costs (ie the coffee) look into a starbucks gift registered card, every x number of coffees you buy you get a free one. Also, once you hit a certain threshold you can customize (add flavors) to cups of coffee for free. Still charge the customer for it, but you get it for no additional cost.<p>3) It doesn't have to be Starbucks. I'd try partnering with unique coffee shops and try cutting a deal with them. They get people aware of their coffee and grow their customer base.<p>4)Or just simply use this to meet people doing interesting things.

From a legal standpoint this is not an admission of guilt. Apple believed that either a) the legal costs of mounting a defense were about the same as the potential damages, b) they could not win in the European Courts (this could be because of the interpretation of their anti-trust laws), or c) the PR debacle would harm their brand and reputation too much. I would pick a combination of B and C in this case, though mostly B.<p>As far as the DOJ anti-trust division is concerned, their job is to investigate and prosecute companies that allegedly  partake in anti-competitive behavior that adversely affect consumer prices. They saw a rise in prices as competition increased, which is contrary to how price dynamics are supposed to work in an increasingly competitive market. Given that the source of this rise in prices was due to simultaneous pressure from publishers on Amazon to switch to an agency pricing model from a wholesale pricing model, it makes sense that the DOJ would investigate. This suit will likely take a few years to come to a conclusion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipad-iphone/news/?newsid=3353332&olo=rss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipad-iphone/news/?newsid=3353332&#...</a>",1338140430

Amazingly, even though this is typically taught in introductory statistics virtually no students actually digest its importance.  You literally cannot understand frequentist statistics without understanding the idea of a sampling distribution.<p>The sampling distribution is the distribution of your statistic (MLE estimate, mean, EAP, MAP, or whatever you want) under repeated sampling from the population distribution.  Frequentism is an evaluation procedure, which can be applied to any estimator whether it be Bayesian or something like MLE.  Frequentists are interested in whether this distribution has ""good"" properties. Supposedly good properties include things like unbiasedness, consistency, minimum variance, etc.  Inference is typically expressed as a function of this distribution (confidence intervals) or by comparing the sampling distribution under some restriction (the null hypothesis) to the actual value of the statistic in the observed sample.<p>Given that you can't typically sample from the population distribution, the practical question becomes how do you approximate the sampling distribution. Typically this is done by appealing to a central limit theorem.  Bootstrapping provides another intuitive approximation.<p>There are all sorts of problem with this approach to statistics despite its success.",1338139610

A product is not just the code.  We see proof of marketing ruling with garbage products getting into customers hands and they have no idea of better solutions that are available.<p>The most important part of this journey is absolutely finding the customer, finding their need that they're willing to pay for, finding how to reach them, and then part addressing their need through code.<p>You need all of those to have a business that makes money, other wise you have a project you want to try to make money with, not a strategic approach to establishing a business.<p>Focusing on making money is terrifying to too many technologists.

In some countries, including Egypt (72%), Bangladesh (69%), Brazil (65%) and South Africa (61%), these numbers for Opera users are significantly higher.""</i><p>> Granted, I'm in the US, which is probably very different from the demographics in Opera Mini's user base.<p>I can only speculate to why they prefer using a mobile, but I think that the infrastructure is so different from our countries that we shouldn't necessarily base our assumptions on what we would have done.",1338138423

It's a great trick that works well, and doesn't require any additional markup if you use :before and :after pseudo-elements. Using CSS instead of images means it's easy to programmatically manipulate it, as well. eg A color picker system with a notch that varies with the color being picked. The new Google+ design uses the triangle trick with a twist, making an open triangle that shows what's underneath it, like your cover photo.",1338138185

What I find interesting is the duality like relationship between MCMC and variational methods. Variational methods are an optimization alogrithm. I don't understand variational methods enough to say anything insightful but given the work showing the duality between optimization and probability* I find this new development of hype to be highly interesting.<p>Drawing on the concept of duality, I  think Variational methods will come to be seen as holding no more power than probabilistic techniques. But a Duality is still great cause you can plumb old techniques to get new results.<p>*<a href=""http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~akian/publis/akian_quadrat_viot_98.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~akian/publis/akian_quadrat...</a>",1338138081

Also, the product is fairly price sensitive and delivery has to be done on a tight schedule.<p>Some suggestions:<p>* target businesses. Your orders will be larger, evenly scheduled and the customers are less price sensitive. Expect tough competition, though, unless ...<p>* Broaden/specialize your product range. I assume you've chosen Starbucks because of the brand recognition. But what if you offered <i>spectacular</i> coffee from local coffee shops (assumption: Starbucks produces average coffee)? This could be one of your USPs: great coffee from local baristas delivered to the doorsteps of your customers.<p>* Transportation makes or breaks any type of delivery service. You need a form of transportation that's dirt cheap (no gas), small yet can carry many cups of coffee. I'm thinking a bike designed for cargo, maybe something like [1] ?<p>* Vacuum flasks may solve some of your issues. Why not carry around a couple of these and pour the coffee when you reach your destination?

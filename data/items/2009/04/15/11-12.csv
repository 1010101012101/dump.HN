563313,comment,563246,563302,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I'm having trouble understanding your problem with the original statement.  To me, it clearly means that with the facilities available (no enormous rockets, for example) it can't easily start from the Earth's surface and get into orbit.<p><i>Approaching</i> the Earth is a completely different issue, and I don't understand why you mention it.  It simply isn't a problem if you're already in space because you make sure you go into some sort of orbit (elliptical, parabolic or hyperbolic - any will do).  You easily have enough speed to do this because you're falling into the gravitational well, and you simply need to deflect your path to one side, miss the atmosphere, and you're on a hyperbolic orbit.  Slow a little and you're in a large elliptical orbit.  Slingshot properly around the Lagrange points (including ""bouncing off"" the unstable ones) and you can convert to a ""standard orbit"" with very little effort.<p>Launching from the Earth's surface requires a huge amount of energy, and it's been stated that it wasn't done.<p>Now, what was your question?",1239796240

563302,comment,563246,563246,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"""In the case of the latest Star Trek movie, the trailer clearly shows the construction of the Enterprise – on earth. This is the source of Nerd Rage for many who will not-so-calmly explain that a Constitution-class starship could not possibly be built on earth because it is too large to escape the earth’s gravity.""<p>Wha?<p>So when the Enterprise comes near to the Earth what happens?  It just can't escape the Earth's gravity, or does it only get stuck when it's near the Earth's surface?  It's not the moon you know; it has engines.<p>NCC-1701-D is supposed to weigh about 400,000 tonnes.  Leaving the Earth's surface to reach LEO requires a delta-v of 10km/s so you've got to accelerate 400,000 tonnes to 10km/s.  The Space Shuttle does this and it weighs around 2,000 tonnes.  So are we really expected to think that a vehicle 200x the size of the Space Shuttle could not be launched into orbit?",1239795648

For example, I searched for ""Gwoemul"" and none of the micro-genres it returned matched the reason I liked the movie - the deliciously dark humour.<p>When I searched for Eight Legged Freaks though it returned ""terrorize goofy carnage"" which is a close enough, if over-simplified, description of Gwoemul.<p>I suppose it boils down to the audience size as well.  More people (on that site) are likely to have seen Eight Legged Freaks because it's older, and because it's Western movie (Gwoemul is Korean).",1239794392

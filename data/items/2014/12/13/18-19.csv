He argued that barbarians deserved enslavement because they lacked souls.<p>Back in 1550, Aristotle was marshalled in an important debate on race: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valladolid_debate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valladolid_debate</a><p>While much of the debate was around the notion that Spain had the right to conquer the Americas, a major part of Bartolomé de las Casas&#x27; debate with Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda centred on the rights of Native Americans. Both men were humanist theologians and well versed in classical works, so Aristotle&#x27;s idea of Natural Slavery was central to their cases.<p>De las Casas argued that native Americans were worthy of the same rights as European Christians because they were rational human beings with souls, not natural slaves. Years later, De las Casas expanded this idea to a universal statement that no human being regardless of race deserved slavery.<p>Sepúlveda took Aristotle on face value and argued that Native Americans were natural slaves and as such didn&#x27;t deserve to be treated as rational human beings, he made the odious argument that enslaving them was a paternal response which improved their lives.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that the debate on the shared humanity of the races and their human rights is an argument that is at least half a millennium old.",1418497175

I&#x27;ve published a small game experiment for iOS and didn&#x27;t expect many purchases after bumping the price up to 99 cents, but the drop-off at even that price point is remarkable. If Apple ever sent me a check I didn&#x27;t notice it. Acquaintances would say &quot;wow, cool!&quot; and then not decide to spend a dollar and try it out. It seems that an enormous amount of self-promotion would be required to make better results likely.<p>The market clearly does not favor this kind of product, but the amazing thing is how often I still hear about friends wanting to get into selling software or games to consumers. I always tell them to consider getting into the enterprise market instead, which is comparatively boring but has a reasonable chance of providing non-trivial income. Say what you will about corporations, but they actually pay for software.<p>My advice to anyone with similar options is to sell software to businesses and <i>maybe</i> hardware to consumers. This effectively rules out most entertainment products. Some people are not discouraged by that, but those people will almost certainly be working day jobs for the foreseeable future anyway. I&#x27;m lucky to have enough free time and money where continuing work on these projects is possible without compromising on quality of life, but the odds are they will never be a primary source of income and I&#x27;m OK with that.",1418497115

Absent a segregating force (e.g. dipole attraction, what causes oil to separate from water), one expects two fluids to eventually become well mixed.<p>Conversely, if you mix two fluids which have a segregating force, you don&#x27;t expect them to stay mixed.

Does it strike you that people who take the opposite view of Einstein&#x27;s—or who even <i>consider its possibility</i>—are treated as merely <i>mistaken</i>? As suffering from a <i>misconception</i>? No—they are treated with opprobrium, condemned with epithets (<i>racist</i>, <i>fascist</i>, etc.), and purged from civil society.<p>No reasonable person denies that the ancestors of slaves were mistreated, but as an explanation for group differences this is not mutually exclusive with cultural or biological factors that may have nothing to do with past oppression.

8745950,comment,8743425,8743995,0,0,Bulkington,,,"HN<p>Journalist here, survivor of several &#x27;digital first&#x27; revolutions and now, officially, a &#x27;content director&#x27; and glad to have a very good job. A couple of things:<p>1. A really good newsroom is really tight. Very few print-trained journalists are in it for the money, so the cause and comradeship are everything. A quick way to ruin a newsroom is to implement sweeping changes that have nothing to do with good storytelling (and also mean a lot of extra work). I&#x27;ve been through several of these reorganizations. In the worst, management delivers a master plan heavy on digital/social goals but then provides no tools or training. Essentially, somebody went to yet another publishing conference, heard the latest on why everyone&#x27;s losing money, or what sort of digital results you need to hit the multiples the current VC owners want to flip their share ... Oh hell, this is too frustrating to relive.<p>Gist: By and large, print journos don&#x27;t do digital. A good story is a good story, but the tools/skills are essentially different. It&#x27;s like telling someone skilled with an epee she&#x27;s going to have start breaking boards. Ordering an accomplished story teller to deliver a list and a quiz each week and promote them heavily across multiple social platforms, for example, is a mistake. You want clickbait, get a pro. You want video, get a pro--not GoPros and iMovie tips for the writers.<p>2. Of course, owners are absolutely expected to do what they think is best for a property. And outside of TNR alums and friends of recent staff, the reaction of journalists has been largely to shrug: Nothing new here, other than the duly noted wrongheadedness of trying to make TNR something it&#x27;s never been. (There&#x27;s also probably some jealously: TNR was a good gig.)<p>But this is what we all fear:\n<a href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/12/charles-johnson-a-digital-darth-vader-113522.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/12/charles-johns...</a><p>And this:\n<a href=""http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/12/01/if-you-cant-parody-them/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/12/01/if-you-cant-parody...</a>",1418496818

Artists literally have to beg publicly for money, to resort to what amounts to a medieval patronage scheme, just to survive at all, all because the audience has simply decided en masse that the value of all creative work is effectively zero.</i><p>Quite. The big gain of copyright was to liberate artists from that to some degree and put them on an economic footing of productivity, where their work could be valued for its commercial potential, with the reasonable proviso that people who wanted to enjoy it would pay to purchase it in some form. Despite the flaws of the publishing industry this worked pretty well and there was a cultural explosion that paralleled the industrial revolution.<p>In HN debates on the subject, I&#x27;ve noticed a small but persistent core of resentment for professional artists, based around the idea that artists shouldn&#x27;t be so greedy as to ask for money because being an artist is fun. And while it certainly can be, a lot of the time it&#x27;s a tedious grind same as any other line of work. I find this analogous to saying software engineers shouldn&#x27;t be paid because they like playing with computers.<p>I read the original Pomplamoose piece and while I respected the position of &#x27;hey we&#x27;re a startup, and while we haven&#x27;t made it we are making it, plus being in a band is awesome&#x27; it nonetheless radiated an air of desperation. The cold hard reality is that you can do a 2 month tour, play to packed houses of paying fans, and still lose $10,000. Criticisms that they paid too much for the stage show are misplaced; it costs money to hire those things, and you need some of those things so that people say your show was fun and exciting rather than dull and boring. People go to a concert to be entertained, after all. Traditionally, bands signed deals with labels because labels have the capital and know-how to promote music, much as studios have the capital and know-how to put out films and so forth. It&#x27;s very very hard to build up that capital organically, and it&#x27;s also very hard to produce a marketable product without a capital investment.",1418496695

The Norwegian fjords, due to their nature, would likely be one of the hiding places for a NATO fleet in a Soviet/Russian battle. Basically they would make the fleet, carriers or subs very hard to find by the one of the biggest threats posed by the Russians, the anti ship missiles launched by aircraft like the Bear. It would also make the Soviet/Russian attack submarines have to work a lot harder and become more exposed - esp to any anti-submarine warfare craft which might UK-Iceland-Norway triangle to operate from.<p>By hiding in the fjords, NATO could still strike using conventional aircraft, cruise missiles or nuclear forces - while the Russian aircraft would have to be much more exposed in order to get a radar picture of where the NATO fleet would be hiding.<p>The Norway coast also offers a wide open flank that NATO can use for attacking any Soviet/Russian nuclear missile submarines and/or attack subs which might try to sneak out over SOSUS into the Atlantic. It essentially has the effect of controlling any movement from the Baltic, Norweigan or Barents Sea - essentially the areas from which some of the most important Russian ports are. A combined fleet/marine assault on a Russian port would also be an option. NATO would also want to deny it to the Russians as it offers a close route to attacking the UK and arguably the Russians see it as an exposed flank.",1418496677

8745887,comment,8745438,8745438,0,0,robert_tweed,,,"The ideas presented here seem pretty sensible. However, there is a risk that if such data is collected, it may later be used to compare surgeons to each other. One of the reasons that is risky is that good surgeons tend to deliberately take on more complex and riskier operations than those less capable, and therefore have statistically worse outcomes. There can also be geographical biases if statistics are summarised, such as certain hospitals having poor outcomes because they happen to get a lot of gunshot wounds, or stabbings, or the local population is older than average, or childbirth rates are higher, etc. It would difficult to control for all possible such variables, and ever more difficult to explain the methodology to the public.<p>It&#x27;s probably a universally good idea as long as there are safeguards to ensure that the data is not shared generally, which might lead to misinformed reactions and subsequently, target-chasing (see: Goodhart&#x27;s law). Using the data purely for personal improvement seems like it should be effective. I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that most surgeons would want to self-improve if they can. Also surgeons tend to be especially competitive, so creating a competition against themselves could be a good motivator in itself.<p>The data could perhaps be used to weed out poorly performing surgeons too. I believe the right way to do that would be to share the data anonymously with peers who are able to interpret it properly. These peers could then flag any worrying anomalies in the data that can&#x27;t be explained away, which should trigger a follow-up investigation of the individual concerned. This could perhaps stop the next Harold Shipman, as well as weeding out incompetence.<p>Of course, it may not be possible to usefully anonymise case data since some of the more complex cases may be sufficiently unique that the surgeon could be personally identified from the description. This would only work if case can be classified broadly enough to avoid personal identification and narrowly enough to provide enough information for peer review.",1418495763

Streamy -  The Voice Of Internet. A social network without the &quot;social&quot; and the &quot;network&quot;. A user can post something and it is visible to everybody but not like Twitter where everybody has her own &quot;stream&quot; of tweets. There is just a single huge stream of posts. No followers, no friends, no private/dedicated stream. Just post something and it will be visible to everybody.<p>2. Tempexchange - Upload a file with no size limit and set an expiration time (max 24 hours). Download it from anywhere with a public or private url. No registration required. No client required. Just upload, share the url, download.<p>3. Moneyplicator. This is a bit complex to explain (and to realize). The concept is: give us X $ and we will you back X + Y% $ (where Y is considerably high, like 20%) but we cannot tell you when (maybe in few hours, in few months or years). How is it possible to manage that in a profitable way? Example: User A gives 10 $ and expect to receive back 12 $ (10$ + 20%). User B, later on, gives 20 $ and expect to receive back 24 $ (20$ + 20%). When the intermediary collects the money from user B it is able to repay user A, retaining a small percentage fee Z (let&#x27;s say 2%) for itself. So the balance for the intermediary would be: +10 (from A) +20 (from B) -11.8 (to A, including a fee of 0.2) = 18.2 of which 0.2 is cashed as the fee and 18 will be used to pay back the money to B. The whole loop keeps going with the following users. It is clear that the intermediary will always have debts to pay but not a deadline to do that and meanwhile it is cashing fees. I am not sure all of this makes proper sense, what do you think?<p>Please let me know your feedbacks!",1418494948

People will post up the ugly pictures and they will post up their favorite slogans, and they will denigrate opponents with brutalities like, &quot;baby killer&quot;<p>This kind of noise completely destroys rational advocacy / debate on the topic, which is why religion and politics are often discouraged in technical and other discussion venues.<p>Now, personify it.  I took a story from Brazil where a 9 year old girl was raped by her father, her mother wanted to get an abortion for her, and the church, state, father and others wanted to deny the girl that.<p>Instead of the usual advocacy path, I asked people what they personally would say to the little girl who doesn&#x27;t want to carry a pregnancy.<p>This required they simulate the scenario, and express their thoughts as actions, or virtual actions in this case, rather than just pull out their favorite &quot;pokemon battle card&quot; type sayings...<p>Amazingly, the dialog split into two camps!<p>The majority of participants answered honestly, and were quite disturbed at the experience.  The majority said they would not tell the little girl no, regardless of their personal beliefs / preferences.  It was the human thing to do.<p>For those ideologues who were being absolutist about it, they would not answer, because they would reveal cracks in their black and white vision of things, so they vilified instead!  And it was intense.<p>The rest of the group turned on them, and they got shouted down.  Secondly, that experience changed the group dynamics.  Abortion noise is no longer tolerated like it was before.  It&#x27;s potency as a distraction is now much less in that venue.  The personification really impacted people.<p>Edit: One absolutist actually said the right answer was to cut the girl open after she has carried the baby far enough along to be viable.  The group response to this was harsh, and they were banned.<p>I personally took a lot of heat for that disturbing approach and had to apologize for the rough dialog.  And I did, citing my interest in finding out what trumps what.  This was well received, but the whole thing was expensive emotionally.<p>Honestly, this is one of the few times I&#x27;ve ever seen the noise machine beat back into submission like that.<p>Lesson there somewhere.<p>(Yes, this is an area of interest of mine, and I&#x27;ve been running little experiments for some time as the problem identified in this thread is growing rapidly and we have few answers.

We should be trying to root out whatever the underlying causes are that lead us to segregate ourselves into the groups that we end up in.  Forced de-segregation (as in the case of bussing kids around in public school districts) is only temporary, as the people who want to be in their groups will take action to achieve that end.<p>For whatever it is worth, I think income inequality (between rich and poor, all races) is probably the biggest inhibitor to this problem.  Motivated-yet-poor people cannot easily break out of their groups, with no money for college and (alot of times) a criminal record preventing them from enlisting in the service.  If you have resources you have choices, and the poor have very little in the way of choice.

Here are the major ones seen very frequently:<p>1. Subject change<p>2. False comparison<p>3. Claim of too many opponents<p>4. Silence<p>5. Claim to either be a member of, or opponents of discussion being members of club, with said membership somehow required to complete what is otherwise a non-rational conclusion.<p>6. Claim of overall subject and or implications of subject complexity being greater than scope of discussion; therefore, it’s all a waste of time. (You would not understand)<p>7. Transformation of rational point at hand to emotional one.<p>8. The bible.<p>9. Redefinition of common words.<p>10. Personal attack.<p>11. Obsfucation. (however you spell it)<p>12. Excess verbosity.<p>What I did was post this, put names on it, including my own, and then start citing it when the behavior is seen.<p>I expected people to moderate the behaviors and perhaps improve dialog.  What actually happened was the behaviors intensified!  They created new ones, and started using them in combination:<p>Subject change, excess verbosity, silence was very common.  Blow up the dialog to prevent realizations or consensus, then go silent to let it all fade away.  Then do it again, and again...<p>Now, something good did happen.  Participants who get it, tended to add their own observations to the list, and a bond formed between them.  This helped differentiate the dialog some, and high clarity material, rational material was easier to identify and that dialog did improve.<p>But the noise makers also improved, making better noise, more frequently, division went up, and the overall tone of the place was harder to enjoy.<p>This led me to another realization:<p>We very often want to frame things as debate when the truth is we are often doing advocacy.<p>Advocacy has three components:  Reason, character, emotion.  Advocacy is a super set of debate.<p>Effective advocates employ all three and here is the kicker:<p>They will trump an effective debater in a dialog.<p>Interesting isn&#x27;t it?",1418493891

There are no external controls at that point.  Now if it&#x27;s only for their benefit what possible reason would a surgeon have to game the score you might ask?<p>You can provide all the assurances in the world that the score is a personal motivator, but we all know that could change at the drop of the hat.  I&#x27;ve seen this far too often in the security field.  Someone will come up with a great measure, will reassure everyone that all unintended consequences have been considered and then boom.  A year down the line an executive, unaware of the ramifications of unintended consequences will want to use the metric for performance evaluations.  I think any surgeon who believes the score is only there to help them and that they shouldn&#x27;t plan for a future where someone pushes to make it more public is being a bit naive in the ways of the world.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say I don&#x27;t think there could be a solution.  The scoring system needs to be built from the ground up with an offset risk equation which provides significant incentive to operate on at risk patients.  Maybe a surgeon gets three points for operating on the patient and if they die they only loose one.  However if they have a healthy patient maybe they start off with one point, with just one to loose.

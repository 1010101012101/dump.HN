14120,comment,14095,14095,0,0,nickb,,,"""Similarly, only two-tenths of one percent of visits to Flickr, a popular photo-editing site owned by Yahoo, are to upload new photos, the Hitwise study found.""<p>Wow! That surprised me. This is very, very low. For a while, blogs were quoting various stats saying that 1% of users are creators, 10% are participators/aggregators (people who vote, comment etc) and rest are lurkers. New numbers are really unnerving since I have so much energy currently invested in a social/participant site. I think it's time to seriously start planning for a plan B.. ""what if"" situations.",1176915090

In fact, I found this article eye-opening, which is funny, because the result seems so obvious.<p>It seems most people who join social networking sites are essentially voyeurs, and this has consequences for the kind of business I'd like to start.<p>What is the trend?  I bet it's pretty constant, or slowly increasing.  -But I have no data to back any of my statements up :)-",1176915032

14115,comment,13924,13943,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Certainly there are different strategies for different markets. I believe Facebook is a bit different from Virb; it started with a relatively new niche. In a way it still serves mostly the same niche, except that the niche it attacked proved to be extremely large, popular, and profitable.<p>If Virb is marketed as a MySpace killer, it's entering crowded arena and cannot escape a feature-by-feature comparison with MySpace. Assuming they are trying to grab defects from MySpace, it seems reasonable to sport a features galore -- as long as MySpace users can feel right at home. If they want blinky text, they got it. Embedded music? Got it. Want more than MySpace? Have more than MySpace. Stuff like that.<p>That said, I think it's more about being clear about your target market and your product goals. Considering iJigg though, I am not so sure about aiming for a similar userbase is what you meant by ""similar goals"". The reason I bring this up is because I'm interested in how you are planning the next steps for your product. I'm nobody to give suggestions here, but I would be cautious about aligning myself with Virb if that's what you're talking about.",1176914404

14111,comment,14109,14109,0,0,Tichy,,,"It annoys me to no end - I already switched back to Yahoo as my primary search engine because Google sends me to the German page all the time. But Yahoo does the same with their mail service (luckily I hardly ever do it). <p>Why? It seems like the worst idea ever! Are programmers just sitting around thinking ""let's do something really cool"" and add this anti-feature? For the record: if I wanted the german Google, I would be clever enough to type google.DE instead of google.COM.<p>P.S.: I know there are ways to make Google show me the english page, but they either involve enabling permanent cookies or typing a longer URL.",1176913625

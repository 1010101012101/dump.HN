I sometimes like to go back and use languages I haven't touched in a long time - it makes me thankful for what I have now, and the code I write in the old language is always better for the exposure to more powerful languages. Not that I'll be breaking out QuickBasic anytime soon. =)",1207277815

I've worked as a Cartographer. Can you show me some of these applications?<p>What Everyblock has done (I've read the article quite a while ago) is assemble a whole lot of opensource technology and make it scale. But is this what really makes the Everyblock product impressive? The simple answer is no. I'm pretty sure the EveryBlock product is far more complicated than the simple apps your College mates whacked together.  In fact I put it to you the EveryBlock technology is just as impressive as googles if not better.<p>It's an easy mistake to make as technologists to just see - technology! The real interesting bits of the Everyblock product can be found in<p>Data collation: the collection, massaging and scrounging of information and correctly applying it to a position.  If you read the article carefully there is some very clever collection of data. Not all your data is given to you on a plate. Some you have to extract from third parties then work out the best way to display it with the limited information you have. Everyblock not only does this to the geographical cadasta but at the Thematic layers as well. With google maps due to it's expansive coverage even the base layer is dodgy.  I noticed this in some of the google examples in my own hometown (melbourne, au).<p>Generalisation: the way the data is portrayed at various levels so it makes sense to the user. For example notice how not all the roads are added (but the block structure is). So if you know the major roads you can still count the minor streets & guess their name.<p>Themes: the way separate layers of information can be interrogated independently.  google does this but as a toolset only. It is up to individual developers to do this and hence we have very little meaningful comparisons of various thematic data in specific geographical areas<p>Ground Truth: is what you see on the map is what is on the ground? This is one problem that Everyblock solves particularly well. They control the geographical database so only official geo data is added from reliable or known official sources. Thematic overlay information can be verified by individual users. If the user information is wrong at some stage the opportunity is given for others to correct it.<p>Style: The google map layout has no style. There is no subtlety in type-faces, word placement colour.  Everyblock developers seem to understand that the difference between an accurate usable map and one that is really easy to read and understand is in the typographical and graphic design.<p>Everyblock succeeds where google does not, because they have concentrated on several big cities instead of trying to map the earth and fail in all but the big cities. In the end maybe I'm comparing apples & oranges. Google has written an API for others to use. I don't think google cares about the end users as much as Everyblock does.",1207277609

154500,comment,153812,153849,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"Thanks!<p>I was thinking of that very link when I wrote this.  Dunno know why I didn't look more carefully for it.<p>The number L = lambda/10 is actually part of the standard definition for a microwave system.  Any circuit that has a physical dimension greater than L is too ""big"" to use standard circuit analysis, because the voltage and current values you measure at different points will be different due to propagation delays, even when those points are connected by a wire with no reactance and negligible resistance at lower frequencies.<p>The world's biggest microwave system (biggest machine period, actually) is the US power grid, even though it oscillates at a measley 60 Hz.  Lambda is about (.6c / 60 Hz) = 1800 miles.<p>This is proof that, electrically as in so many other things, the Midwest is 180 degrees out of phase with the rest of the country.",1207277469

154496,comment,154077,154484,0,0,halo,,,"The current $80m in revenue is an extremely misleading figure to base a valuation upon. Craigslist exploit the absolute minimum of their assets and any company taking control could make considerably more with little additional expense without even considering the potential of international expansion or using its ability to expand other brands or services.<p>While I think the article is more than a hyperbolic with its projected revenues and valuation, I certainly think a valuation of a few billion would be fair, especially when you consider Skype was bought for €1.9b, YouTube was bought for $1.65b and Bebo was bought for $850m.",1207277190

While for a large project this is pretty easily  the ""right"" way to design a DVS (if for a large / professional grade project you're not explicitly planning everthing, you should be worried), for smaller projects I think darcs' patch dependency tracking approach is much better (or at least much lighter weight).",1207275505

154484,comment,154077,154077,0,0,trekker7,,,"I'm genuinely confused about valuations. Craigslist is making $80 million in revenues, and of course less in profits. Say someone buys the company/organization for $5 billion. Won't it take a good many years to recover the price paid via the site's profits? In general, when companies acquire other companies, they should want to make back their purchase cost quickly and hopefully make a lot more in the near future right? Even if the acquirer thinks they can hack the business model, add more advertisements, or charge for more things, isn't it a huge gamble to pay so much over the <i>current</i> profits? I'm missing something but don't know what.",1207275377

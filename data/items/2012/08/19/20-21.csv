Sure, the interior of the car will change, but compare with other modes of transport that you can be on without driving: fights, trains, busses, even being a passenger in a car. I don't think it's a coincidence that in all of them, you're sitting or lying still in varying degrees of comfort, while working and/or being entertained.<p>Also, there an elephant in the room: The RV. It's great for road-trip holidaying, but not practical for living. I don't see how driver-less-ness changes that value-proposition drastically - although a road trip holiday with most of the driving done at night, while you're sleeping, could be awesome.",1345409842

On the one hand we're all here to support each other in building things and all that plus this really was a good way to show the HN crowd how Branch is used/useful which I know would appeal to a lot of us. There's no doubt having a guy from Branch post a Branch here is a great way to get people using it and talking about it. But then again it also feels a bit sneaky and just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. If we give him the benefit of the doubt we can assume that because he's involved with Branch he uses it and also wanted to pose a question to HN so in the end his use of Branch would seem just this side of innocent. If we don't give him the benefit of the doubt then I'm not sure it was right. I do give the benefit of the doubt though, personally.<p>As to whether it belongs on the front page... Well technically the front page is a reflection of this community. If its on the front page then it belongs there because it was voted onto it.

And of course it's possible, but should that happen it won't be a great vindication of the Copenhagenists, it will simply mean that all interpretations of the theory are equally wrong.<p>Second argument tries to address the parochiality argument by raising the suggestion that decoherence may be necessary for consciousness, which is itself exceedingly parochial. Sure, we haven't observed consciousness in a coherent quantum system, just as we haven't observed photosynthesis, or planet formation.

For example:<p><pre><code>  users.select(&:meets_some_critera?).each(&:update!)\n</code></pre>\nYou could totally do that in a for each loop if you wanted.  But it isn't really composable.  While this works for the basic update...<p><pre><code>  for user in users do\n    user.update! if user.meets_criteria?\n  end\n</code></pre>\n... what if you wanted to then sum up the new account balances?  In the first example, you'd just chain on a couple more enumerable methods:<p><pre><code>  users.select(&:meets_some_critera?).each(&:update!)\n    .map(&:account_balance).inject(&:+)\n  \n</code></pre>\nWith the for each construct you'd have to pass in an accumulator variable and keep track of whether to sum or not.  While you certainly can do it in a for each construct, I'd argue that you'd be missing out on what makes ruby, ruby.  And getting beginners in that more functional(ish) frame of mind sooner rather than later is a very good thing.<p>--edited a few times for formatting/clarity",1345407276

Yes, a walled garden is no fun for anyone once it reaches a critical mass. We're sort of starting to see this with Twitter, with their recent API adjustments. Decentralized and open platforms are also really tough, just look at OpenID. The adoption is not there.<p>Apple saw that the current SMS implementation was flawed in many ways and sought out to improve/replace it. For example, all of the carriers (at least in the US, with the exception of the underdog Sprint) charge an exorbitant amount of money just to send/receive text messages. I pay $20 per month for that ability. SMS also has a limit of 160 characters. It also only works via cellular, whereas iMessage works via data connection. This is awesome for me, as I live in the boonies where I don't always have a cell connection (but do have excellent wifi). Being able to reply from multiple devices is also nice. Let's not forget all of the little 'nice-to-haves' like knowing when a message has been delivered and/or read, knowing when the other party is replying, etc...<p>Alas, they did this because the carriers wouldn't. Prior to Apple releasing the iPhone, you couldn't buy a phone that didn't have some one-off UI, preloaded with garbage apps, etc... Apple forced the hand of the mobile industry with their iPhone (this is obvious to many, but concrete evidence exists inside of the Samsung vs. Apple court documents recently released)<p>Apple is now doing this again with iMessage. They took something that really needed revolutionizing, and did it.  It began as something great for members of the Apple ecosystem.

After using ""each"" for a while, I came to realize that I was programming in a functional style without even knowing it.<p>Earlier today I read through Rich Hickey's posts explaining reducers and actually used them to get crazy performance gains from some Clojure code I was writing...but I highly doubt I would've gotten there without Ruby's ""each"".<p>I've seen Zed argue on this point before, and I've always been dubious of his ""concern"".

7310626,comment,7310077,7310077,7,0,programminggeek,,,"I think the bigger problem with ORM&#x27;s or database driven application design in general is that you start to see the world through the eyes of the database and how you move things around inside it. Thus, your code resembles your database more than your database resembles your code.<p>Ironically, developers would never think to do this with a storage mechanism like the filesystem. There is no great popularity in filesystem based ORM&#x27;s. Somehow when we deal with the filesystem we treat it as it is - data storage and retrieval. When we deal with 3rd party api&#x27;s we tend to keep them at arms length as well.  Yet, when we deal with the database, we treat it as some other thing that seeks to influence the design of our code on a fundamental level.<p>I wrote about this like a year ago: <a href=""http://brianknapp.me/the-filesystem-test/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brianknapp.me/the-filesystem-test/</a> and I don&#x27;t think much has changed since then.",1393480514

I&#x27;d only been using Haskell for a couple of months, and I&#x27;d never done any web programming; so I figured I should try to use something that wouldn&#x27;t require quite so much &quot;stuff&quot;.<p>I finally decided to try out Clojure because I&#x27;m planning on using Datomic for the main datastore (because it looks like I can have it backed by Cassandra, which lets me store all of our data in an HDFS cluster.) and the &quot;Web Programming with Clojure&quot; book just came out. I figured I could probably figure out a very basic database-driven view web app just by going through the book. That turned out to be true, actually, and it wasn&#x27;t that hard to get my app up and running.<p>What dawned on me going through the book was that what seemed complicated to me really wasn&#x27;t a function of the language, but the way almost all mvc web libraries seem to be laid out; and that actually once I understood how they worked, I could probably implement the same thing very similarly in almost any language that has a similar library.<p>So I might eventually look into making a REST api using Snap to handle the requests, and sort of encapsulating all input and output in the system with Haskell.",1393480261

You have to understand indexes, clustering, execution plans, and query optimization to get good performance. Add an ORM to the picture and then you have to figure out how to say what you want in this brand new language, through a mapping layer.<p>I don&#x27;t want to give up either objects or relational databases, (the choice that some other comments have suggested). What I am willing to give up is an ORM generating SQL. Writing SQL doesn&#x27;t bother me. What bothers me is dealing with Java PreparedStatements, Connections, and ResultSets. This is all trivial boilerplate stuff, that an automated approach can do easily. I want to preserve my brain and fingers for the hard stuff, writing clean, fast Java and SQL.<p>I have heard that iBatis takes this approach, but I haven&#x27;t tried it myself.",1393478715

Is it that I just upload the source and it runs some magic, or you will review manually and return back in a week? As it&#x27;s something new (at least for me), I am a bit confused. But maybe explanation would be confusing for users? But maybe then people who would sign up convert better since they were not mistaken?

7310503,comment,7310441,7310441,2,0,Aqueous,,,"That&#x27;s technically my title, although my company is so small (8 people) that it is not exactly clearly defined. However, a lot of what I do is &quot;architect-y&quot; in that it involves the exact planning or blueprinting of the software that we are about to create.<p>I spend a lot of time leading the planning of new features for implementation. This includes, in many cases, going through the requirements/specifications documents and, as precisely as possible, laying out what needs to be done to implement each feature. Since most of our applications are MVC-patterned database-backed web applications, I start off by defining the SQL schema, down to writing the SQL evolutions. Since the primary data structures in any given application mimic the schema, the data structures usually follow directly from the schema and are pretty easy to clearly define. Then, having created the schema/model structures, it becomes a matter of defining exactly what functions/methods need to be written, defining the function signature of each function (we work primarily in Scala). I leave the function signatures as stubs to be implemented by our developers. \nThen I create cards for our Kanban board. Usually I create one card per unit of functionality (along with complete unit tests) for this functionality. I also create separate sprints for integration test of each piece of functionality. I put them in the Backlog and assign them to each of our programmers. I then code along with my team to rip through the cards as quickly and correctly as we can, hoping to honor my design as much as possible while making any necessary changes when it turns out the implementation we had planned is either too difficult or complex, or will not solve the problem adequately.<p>The planning process really serves to pre-answer as many questions as possible that would otherwise come up during the course of implementing a user story or feature.   I go down as fine-grained into the detail of what needs to be done as possible without actually writing the implementation, so that developers have as few questions as possible when they actually sit down to write the code. The more questions we have pre-answered, the more clearly defined our follow-up questions will be, the ones we encounter on the way to implementing our design.<p>I hope this helps.",1393477941
7310502,comment,7306446,7309599,1,0,mendicant,,,"There are certain languages and situations where the pattern does make sense. But as a heavy C# coder, I find that more often than not you&#x27;re dealing with a class heavy codebase where it&#x27;s more important that you _don&#x27;_ do foo()?.bar?.bing(). Specifically as things happen such as refactoring you often need to ask the question should something &#x27;care&#x27; that a foo has a bar which has a bing. Perhaps if you want to know about a bing that is down the chain from Foo, perhaps Foo should provide you with the Bing somehow (which really helps with refactoring as codebases grow to years and potentially decades old).<p>It&#x27;s not always so cut and dry, and there are situations where this is a very valuable tool. I just feel that down the road if you feel like there is a valid reason for refactoring object hierarchy that you&#x27;ll potentially be doing yourself (or those that follow) a disservice in the long run.",1393477930

Additionally, I don&#x27;t think we know if the security updates released for mountain lion and lion also affected Snow Leopard. And if it did, well, Apple moves quicker than Microsoft does anyway with new OS release every year.<p>If there are still people running Snow Leopard, either they have an old computer that is more than 5 years old, or they specifically don&#x27;t want to upgrade to Lion. For the former, Apple knows most people will have upgraded their old computers by now, or will soon in the future. For the latter group, most know what they&#x27;re doing by not upgrading.<p>Snow Leopard is 4 years old. And the last update for it was September 2013, just 5 months ago.

This has proven to be pretty dumb.  It&#x27;s both less performant and less reliable than the relational databases it purports to replace.  On top of this, any interesting application of the data besides basic CRUD is either slow and a total pain in the ass or just not possible.<p>SQL isn&#x27;t going away because it&#x27;s valuable to exploit relationships between data and because it&#x27;s pretty good at doing that.

That way I can run my apps in standalone mode or as part of a &quot;real&quot; deployment (nginx, uwsgi, python-app, mysql). SQl-Alchemy definitely helps take some of the pain out of that arrangement (although certainly not all of it). For some tasks I use the ORM layer of SA and for other tasks I just use their SQL Expression Language.<p>I also appreciate all the work the SA devs have done to help mitigate SQL injection. I recommend using the SQL Expression Language without the ORM to help mitigate SQL injections (following from defense in depth).

7310492,comment,7310077,7310355,5,0,habitue,,,"Yeah, I think sqlalchemy broke the mold. It starts from the idea that you already know and understand SQL and relational constructs well, then adds a layer of abstraction that lets you skip tons of boilerplate and write really elegant code. Personally, while there are lots of good decisions in sqlalchemy like the unit of work pattern (in contrast to the active record pattern), the one that pays off time and again is representing the SQL ast as python objects. It eliminates and entire class of text munging issues that occur when you write raw SQL and just completely makes you wonder &quot;where&#x27;s the mismatch they keep talking about?&quot;",1393477615

Sad day all around.<p>Edit: in fact I wonder if instead of building yet another IPv4 traversal tool, new applications that require P2P connectivity should actually start building it as an IPv6-in-something tunnel.

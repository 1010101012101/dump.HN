What do you think it says about you as a candidate if you couldn't be bothered to replace ""Dear Hiring Manager"" with my name?

Not single right answer, but here's an idea: Most jobs--especially at startups--are really about solving a problem that the hiring company has. Sure, the job title might say ""DevOps Ninja"" but if you read carefully you can figure out that what's really going on is the company has grown rapidly and needs to get serious about its messy, hacked-together infrastructure.

This is generally a good thing, but it's bad in the context of rapid scaling (which is what most VC-funded startups are trying to do) because convexity creates a need to fill specialized job queries <i>fast</i>. In a saner world, companies could hire a generally smart person and give her 6 months to train up. Most VC-funded startups either can't afford that, or don't think they can. They want ""plug and play"" and that necessitates purple squirrel queries, which creates a job market that leaves them just as unhappy as employees.<p>It sucks for both sides, but the upshot is that when you get a job, you're generally paid well (perhaps to compensate for the wonky purple-squirrel queries, companies going out of existence, and high turnover).<p>Incidentally, as bad as our job search latency is, I think it's worse for regular managers at the same pay level. In managerland, the going assumption is that it takes 1 month to find a new job per $20k; for us, it seems to be 1 <i>week</i> per $20k if actively searching. The biggest mess for us is the stereotype that makes active searching dishonorable because ""good developers never look for jobs"" (which isn't true).",1364864111

If it's a good company and you're happy with everything else, you should stick with it. Good jobs are rare, especially in VC-funded startup land (despite its excellent marketing).<p><i>I make roughly 115k a year, which at first seemed like a ton after moving here from a relatively low COL area. Lately though, the combination of looking at my account balances after paying rent + seeing people talk about salaries on HN make me think that I am on the very low end of the pay scale.</i><p>Financial outliers seem more common on HN than they actually are. You're probably on the low end (~30-40th percentile) compared to where you should be, but not by that much, and you're on the high end by the standard of most of the country. The delta is a rounding error compared to issues such as the quality of work you're getting and your likelihood of advancement.<p><i>Combine that with the paltry amount of equity I have and the fact that my company gives absolutely zero bonuses</i><p>That's typical. Raises are also rare in startups. If things are going well, the improvement of equity valuation <i>is</i> the raise. If things are going badly, that's not a time to be asking for things.<p>I hate to break it to you, but there are only two ways to get a serious equity slice in most startups: (1) be a founder, which probably isn't within your financial resources right now unless you have the connections to get immediate funding, or (2) become one of those god-awful executive implants that VCs shove into companies, who don't get large percentages (they might get 1-2%) but get their cut when the company's de-risked and the valuation is legitimately high, making them paper millionaires if they survive the vesting period.<p>Once companies take outside funding, they generally can't give real equity to non-executives even if the founders want to. The pathetic equity slices aren't because the founders are assholes, but because the employee option pool might only be 10-15 percent.<p>You may want to read this: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/07/08/dont-waste-your-time-in-crappy-startup-jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/07/08/dont-waste-yo...</a> . I know nothing about your company, but there are a lot of awful startups out there built to turn clueless young talent into gold.<p>The real question is, though: what are you learning? If you're getting good projects and learning a lot, you should probably stick around until you stop learning or get ""pigeonholed"" or overlooked by management. If you're treated well and see a future at this company, then stay. $115k for a developer with 5 years experience is slightly on the low side, but I've seen numbers <i>much</i> lower. If your job is legitimately challenging, I don't think the difference between what you have and what you'd get at your next job (probably 10-15k) merits the risk of being ""the new guy"" again and getting a lesser quality of work-- unless you find something really good with people you trust.<p>The Bay Area and New York are disgustingly expensive. Some people our age are getting savings, and some of us are living in expensive, singular places with the hope of rapid career advancement. The career progress that comes from living in a ""star city"" is our ""savings"", for most of us. But there are a lot of good companies outside of the star cities, and that seems to be accelerating, so if you can find something great elsewhere and can get real savings and rapid career growth, obviously that's a huge win.",1364862830

The reduce has a semantic goal of computing one value out of the array, besides explicitly handling intermediate results, e.g. in this case, you can think about the .reduce as computation of a single deferred that will fire when everything completes, whereas you can get to the same effect with the .each loop by using the pipeline variable.<p><pre><code>  var alldone = $('[id^=row]').toArray().reduce(function(l,r){
  		return l.pipe(function(){
  			return $(r).animate({opacity:opacity}, 100);
  		});
  	}, $.Deferred().resolve());
</code></pre>
The conceptual boundary between .each and .reduce is blurred due to the two-phase nature of this code, i.e. the outer function runs as soon as the execution hits the statement and traverses all the elements, and the inner function runs as the deferred chain fires and consumes the deferreds. .reduce allowed me to think both the inner and outer functions to run as a reduction; even though the outer is really a loop.<p>Interesting thing about code reviews: 10% of the code generates 90% of the discussion.",1364861710

However, the color of a person's skin does not contribute to the sickle-cell anemia pathology in any way, it is merely correlated to the presence of sickle-cell trait. A light skinned person with sickle-cell anemia responds to treatment in the same manner as a dark skinned person, the dark skinned person is merely more likely to develop the pathology due to genetic correlation.<p>The same logic applies to this case-study, if it were not compounded by various other idiosyncrasies.

Velocity has to do with the amount of economic activity associated with a given money supply."" [1] It can be thought of as the ""rate of turnover in the money supply"" [2]. It is a good indicator of the ""health"" of a currency.<p>The annualised velocity of the M2 Money Stock for Q4 2012 2 was 6.152 [2]. That is, the average dollar in the form of notes and coins in circulation (M0), traveller's cheques, checking account/demand deposits, savings deposits, time deposits/CDs under $100 000, and individuals' money market deposits was spent 1.538 times on economically useful activities in the fourth quarter of last year.<p>The annualised velocity of the Bitcoin Money Stock for Q4 2012 was 1.27. That is, the average Bitcoin in existence was transacted 0.32 times in the last 90 days of 2012. This includes economically useless transfer payments, i.e. transactions not involving the exchange of real goods or services, as well as economically useless hoarded or lost coins, i.e. Bitcoins not in circulation and so less a unit of ""money"" than a speculative asset (in the case of hoarding). Since this is a ratio, the two balance out, though it is still biased to the downside. For the 30 days ending on 29 March 2013, it was 1.86. Here is what it has been doing since February 2009 [3].<p>More encouragingly, Bitcoin Velocity has quadrupled YoY. M2 Velocity declined 4% over the same time. I would thus offer, very tentatively, that there is a substantial portion of the Bitcoin economy involved in real transactions (versus financial ones, e.g. trading on an exchange).<p>Curiously, yet to emerge (to my knowledge [EDIT: which was  wrong]) is a majour vendor of Bitcoin mining equipment that accepts Bitcoin as a mode of payment. If that were to happen, the Bitcoin economy would have an endogenous ""risk-free rate"" in the form of mining yields, with power companies serving as the most salient factor.

Which is a whole lot better than the crap ""common wisdom"" of EVERYONE NEED 8 HOURS OF SLEEP that is thrown out for days on end.<p>Also, never take personal anecdote seriously.  Anecdotes will only lead to worse science, not better.",1364861047

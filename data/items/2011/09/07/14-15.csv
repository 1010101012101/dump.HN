The more Unix you touch, the more you realize you can't rely on Bash to work how you expect it across all different systems (if they have Bash installed). You will end up relying more on sed, awk, grep and your shell scripting will become more generic - but more portable.<p>On the other hand, Perl rarely changes.

This means the latency of their system will look relatively better by a factor of 4.<p>If they now find an algorithm that scales to 2000 nodes with an efficiency as low as 20%, this is a breakthrough achievement. It would be portable to a C/C++ based program with ""only"" a 4 times faster interconnect.<p>That said, an engine with a primitive search scales better because the tree is more regular and it's easier to predict the real size of workloads.

User Interface design (aka, usability) was a computer science specialty long long before it was a thing people with degrees that have anything to do with photoshop or color have been doing it.<p>I <i>constantly</i> see designers put out things that are non-standard and unintuitive (I work in the iPhone world). I don't want to hear any ""no-true scotsman"" about that how they're bad designers, they're not.  ""Design"" people generally come from information display background, not interactivity design background. Interactivity was a discipline that came from ergo and HCI researchers, not design schools.<p>But usability is different than information display. They throw expensive, non-functional items out there all the time, as well as ridiculous control schemes that work like crap.<p>For this reason alone, ignoring designers, and at best working with a <i>usability</i> expert, could be productive, but worrying about people who specialize in visual appeal and just try to stick onto interaction design because it sounds good on a resume is a bit rich.<p>UX as a field sucks because too many people who were taught to make pretty things are putting on airs as if they have an education on making things that work well. Actual usability people (with training and all that) are gems usually. If you don't know how to do a usability study, with controls and all that, you're probably missing a few things to prove yourself as a user interaction designer.",1315407265

Craigslist has come quite far without what we would all consider ""design"" (though that's debatable - functionality <i>is</i> design). Alas, traditional aesthetic design has never found its way to Craigslist.<p>As a designer, you might find scripts / examples / tutorials that work, but without understanding the entire web stack it's going to be difficult to even get an ""MVP"" running. If I asked some designer friends to go set up a server to run Django, they probably wouldn't know where to start (though some would hunker down and truly figure it out, they would be the exception).<p>My opinion is that ""decent design"" is easier to achieve than ""decent functionality"". Don't get me wrong, I'm all for professional design and appreciate every minute that goes into it - every single app I've built over the past few years was started by an awesome designer (even my no-revenue side projects).<p>For the developer, though, things like <a href=""http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap</a> are helping us get <i>very</i> far into an app without asking designers for favors (or paying someone).",1315406686

Besides the website, part of the original concept was to seed the world with ""Rosetta Discs"", metal spheres with an approximately 2,000-year lifespan, etched with optically readable samples of thousands of written languages. Future humans who found the discs would be able to review and understand the dead languages on it as long as at least one of the languages on the disk was still known. The website (<a href=""http://rosettaproject.org/disk/concept/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rosettaproject.org/disk/concept/</a>) describes how it would work:<p><i>The Disk surface shown here, meant to be a guide to the contents, is etched with a central image of the earth and a message written in eight major world languages: Languages of the World: This is an archive of over 1,500 human languages assembled in the year 02008 C.E. Magnify 1,000 times to find over 13,000 pages of language documentation. The text begins at eye-readable scale and spirals down to nano-scale. This tapered ring of languages is intended to maximize the number of people that will be able to read something immediately upon picking up the Disk, as well as implying the directions for using itget a magnifier and there is more.<p>On the reverse side of the disk from the globe graphic are over 13,000 microetched pages of language documentation. Since each page is a physical rather than digital image, there is no platform or format dependency. Reading the Disk requires only optical magnification. Each page is .019 inches, or half a millimeter, across. This is about equal in width to 5 human hairs, and can be read with a 650X microscope (individual pages are clearly visible with 100X magnification).</i><p>The disk still seems to be a work in progress, but the Rosetta project is concentrating on many Internet and audio-based initiatives (see <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/us/29bcculture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/us/29bcculture.html</a>)",1315406663

When my co-founder and I started building our company, we made sure we followed the process of user-centric design and took wireframes and mockups and photoshop files to our customers well before we even started coding.<p>We would have completely missed our market if we had just jumped into coding before going after design.

For example I wouldn't waste time in developing you own tracking system (point 1) but use an existing one using markers. Also for the depth images I think you could do much better with a Kinect instead of this camera, because it will give you much more detailed depth image (however only indoors). I think the ideas of tracking the eye position and is really worth exploring. The projecion of the image on the retina is also realy cool, but I think it is much more difficult and one year will not be enough to achieve reasonable results. Good luck :)",1315405357

Every tool has drawbacks.<p>1) Documentation for the standard Scala library is absolute crap.  The JDK is much better at not only documenting methods in a reasonable way but also giving you common usage patterns for classes/packages.  I really don't like having to piece together the method signatures of a class to figure out the intended usage pattern.<p>2) This might be a problem in IntelliJ but I can't figure out a good way of getting the debugger to work well.  Sometimes it'll catch breakpoints other times it won't.<p>3)Lack of maturity in libraries.  A perfect example is Scala's built in XML support.  It works for 90% of what you want to do but finds good ways to waste your time, especially if you're dealing with namespaces.<p>4) Obscure syntax and abuse of the single argument method call syntax.  What does :+ mean to anyone?  What's the difference between +++ and ++ or :: and :::.

The software requirements are only PHP and MySQL so I'm guessing it's not doing anything like in-memory caching and it'll need to hit MySQL quite a bit to generate the chat. How does it perform under 100 users? Or 1000? or more?",1315404223

Although I must admit I have no idea if the game mentioned allows in game trades which are crucial to allow RMT.<p>If so it's not so risky as the sucker will end up being the player who bought the items and I doubt anyone ever pursues their claims as they've invariably violated the TOS of the game.<p>Edit: The more I think about this, the more genius a way to monetize this hack it is.",1315404176

I wanted to write a quick FUSE fs using ruby, so I installed gems and other dependencies. But since MacFUSE has been deprecated for a while, it's not easy to get everything working.<p>It could probably work under OSX, but given the current state of FUSE on Lion, I gave up (and did not try it under Linux yet).<p>While trying to setup my FUSE environment, I installed every FUSE version, many gems with a couple of ruby versions with rvm, rbenv, ruby-build, etc. When playing with new tools and environments, I always end up with lots of useless or broken stuff.<p>This setup allows me to keep my base system clean and simple.<p>I do not use it daily, but it's nice to have it ready to launch when needed.",1315404065

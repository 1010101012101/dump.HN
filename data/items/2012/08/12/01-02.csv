The response is essentially that successful petitions bring the topic to discussion at the White House. This might not seem like much, and it isn't ""much"", but it's something. In the same way big donors do not (usually) buy policy directly, but rather the ear of the administration, these petitions give a small voice in the proces of governance.

These people religiously run 45-55 miles a week (slightly below your number, I know, but there is nothing magical about those last 5 miles).<p>They also run a slow 50. But, they still run around 50 a week and they are overweight.<p>The point being there is nothing magical about running long distances and being lean, IMO. Someone could (and like I said, I know several) run that and be overweight). I know plenty of people who ride bikes 150-200+ miles a week and are overweight.<p>What I suspect you mean when you say 50mpw is that someone running 50mpw at 5 min/mile pace (or less) is not going to be overweight. And that is probably true. But you are factoring in intensity then, which changes the equation entirely.<p>For instance, I know someone that lifts weights 4 times a week for 1 hour a day and is fat. He's been doing it for years.<p>I also know someone who lifts weights 4 times a week for 1 hour a day  and just won a local bodybuilding contest.<p>There are so many things I didn't say in the above it isn't worth talking about them?

4371553,comment,4370338,4371197,3,0,hazov,,,"In my experience I think notation would not make the life of a student much easier if you're learning things at the level Terry Tao writes in his blog, he's not writing college level math for engineers (ie. Calculus, LinAlg, Basic Fourier Analysis and some other topics) but Graduate level math for mathematicians and people interested in pure and/or applied mathematics. Notation is not the problem when you're having a hard time studying Functional Analysis, Algebraic Topology, Advanced Probability (using Lebesgue integral) or trying to understand the proof of the Prime Number theorem.<p>The problem actually is that notation preference is a matter of personal preference, the physicists love the bra and ket notation I think it is very confusing, maybe because I'm not a physicist. I think any time someone comes with new notation for settled things they just turns the matter worse.<p>Partial Differential Equations is a perfect example how these things works, there's generally different notations being used by mathematicians, physicists and engineers, at least in my experience, and because every couple of years someone comes with a new notation to ""simplify"" everything to his field of study, but a introductory note of a page or two in any book is enough to explain the differences between the notations.<p>The grandparent argument is valid for some math below graduate level and some confusing bits in advanced mathematics but it's generally not a problem for anything above. I actually think notation is a problem for students that are not that much interested in mathematics, high schoolers and some engineering students that I saw in my life generally are confused why some things are written the way they are without any justification. This is a problem with learning methods and if you just give a new arbitrary notation to these students I believe the problem will persist.<p>I also think that trying to reboot the entire mathematical notation to fit areas such as aerospace control theory, algorithm complexity theory, abstract algebra, biostatistics and thermodynamics, among other fields would probably result in failure, like creating a universal language like esperanto that would never be used.",1344736084

4371551,comment,4371057,4371285,2,0,douglasisshiny,,,"I have a similar disclaimer: personal weight loss, no reddit.<p>The main point of this post: I was under the impression that high-protein diets are not healthy over the long term. That such diets lead to health problems because of the high protein content.<p>I agree that less intake, more exercise is vague advice, but aren't nutritionists a better source of advice? It doesn't seem difficult to find more nuanced advice on the internet, although I just sort of figured it out on my own.<p>Anyway... I entered college at 270lbs. I gained weight eating at the dining hall (pizza, etc.) After hating myself long enough, I decided to lose a lot of weight. Contrary to some comments in this thread (stating that running / cardio doesn't result in much weight loss), I did it by running. I ran 3-5 miles 4-6 times a week (for awhile it was just 3 miles). For a 3-mile run, I would burn about 500 calories. When you consume about 1700-2000/day, and run 3 miles 4-6 times a week, that adds up quickly, especially considering you're burning calories even after the run.<p>I also ate a diet consisting of reduced everything (fewer carbs, fewer proteins, fewer fatty foods). I focused on eating a lot of vegetables, fruits, some lean meats, and healthy grains.<p>After four months I was down to 200lbs. Years later, I'm around 185. I've gone up a few pounds at points, but never let it get out of hand.<p>This post is cluttered, but I guess my main point was that it's not much more than exercise more, eat healthier. And eat healthy in a way that you think ""this is my diet for the rest of my life."" I'm perplexed by people who initiate insane diets that deviate from the dietary habits of humans for thousands of years; or spend a ridiculous amount of money (I was lucky to have an indoor track at my college, but these days I just run outside).",1344735926

I don't have more than 3 hours a week to lift very heavy, and don't want to spend more time at the gym. I have better things to do. Yet, I'm down from 185lbs a few years ago to 145lbs and 7% body fat and will likely hit 6% or lower soon. You've all seen Fight Club, you know what that looks like. It's a huge personal satisfaction and you feel healthier than ever.<p>How? Cut calories and cut carbs to 100g a day or lower. Primal/paleo/IF work wonders, but you still have to count calories very carefully at the end of the day. The whole ""eat whatever you want as long as it's fat and protein"" works down to maybe 10-12% body fat, but below that you need to start cutting.<p>Mark Sisson might give you the impression that you can eat all you want, but you got to look at some of his food logs to get an idea of how you can look like him at age 50+.

I had started reading up before this was available, but it really tied a lot of basics together that I was confused about.<p>From there, read papers.  For me, my primary interest is in neural networks.  Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio have two very good groups that both have contributed a great deal to research in this area, and their websites provide lots of good stuff.<p>After spending a bit of time on a survey of the field, try to come up with a practical goal as quickly as you can: I want to use ML to do X.  Then, try to do that.  When you get stuck, get back to reading until you find the answer.  Rinse and repeat.  The math naturally falls into this--you'll get stuck on things that you can't fix without a decent understanding of the math.  So figure out how to formulate the question you're really asking, hit google, and read.  Then try again.  Rinse and repeat.<p>If you're interested in neural networks, I can also recommend the deep learning tutorials associated with Theano, a library for compiling python code down to CUDA code to get speed increases on certain operations that will let you train your models about 10-40x faster on GPU than if you tried it on CPU.<p>For me, putting things into practice has helped me make the biggest leaps in understanding, but of course I wouldn't have been able to do that at all without getting a basic grasp of the mechanisms involved.  So it's a bit of push and pull between practice and learning, like anything worth doing.",1344735271

Though, I must ask...what is your goal?<p>My belief is that nearly everything in how someone eats, worksout and approaches fitness and health should be decided AFTER they understand what their goal is. Nearly all the studies above seem to have no idea what they are actually testing (the goal).<p>Right now I am an amateur powerlifter and bodybuilder. I play sports like hockey, basketball and flag football. In the past I did triathlons and ultramarathons with friends. Do you think I approach the different phases in my life EVEN REMOTELY the same in terms of diet and exercise?<p>So what is your goal? I'll provide a quick handy guide for some I read above.<p>Trying to maximize your years on this earth? Only known way is to calorie restrict. Like extreme calorie restrict. Say, around 1000-1200 cals a day.<p>Trying to maximize athletic performance in power sports (hockey, football, basketball, baseball etc)? Sprints+heavy weights for a workout. Carb cycling for food (high carb days post working out, low carb days when you don't work out).<p>Trying to maximize athletic performance in enduro sports (distance cycling, distance running)? Know your carb maintenance level, eat for that + protein and lower(ish) fat (fat + carbs leads to weight gain almost universally. So, if you NEED to eat carbs as your main source of fuel, you'll need to lower fat if you don't track your carb intake very closely). *<p>*Note: there are plenty of people that perform enduro sports on VLC (very low carb) and use fat as their fuel. However, I haven't found studies on this yet so I don't recommend it wholesale. If someone wants to try it and can work through the re-acclimation period in their body, give it a shot.<p>I can go on, but I need to know what people have in terms of goals. I personally wasted too many years middling around without knowing what I actually wanted to achieve. I know others do as well. Know your goals, then you can set your approach to achieving those goals....persist and you'll hit 'em!",1344735269

As for why Mars cooled off faster, I don't think anyone knows definitively.  Mars has very little atmosphere so it doesn't retain much heat.  It is also much smaller than the Earth so it would be expected to cool off faster under equal conditions.  On the other hand Venus is also smaller than the Earth but is one seriously hot place, and not completely due to its proximity to the Sun.<p>So why doesn't Mars have an atmosphere?<p>Well, it has little to no magnetic field so it is very poorly protected from solar winds, a massive solar ejection could have just ripped the atmosphere off.  On the other hand maybe Mars used to have a magnetic field and it was only lost due to cooling effects that occur even with an atmosphere.  Using Venus again as a counter point is also has nearly no magnetic field yet it maintains an extremely dense atmosphere so there is no 1:1 correlation with not having a magnetic field and not having an atmosphere.<p>I don't know of any consensus on what it takes during planet formation to end up with an atmosphere to retain heat and a magnetic field to protect that atmosphere, I've heard lots of theories but its still an open question to be answered.",1344733841

Our understanding has changed and we now know much more.<p>For instance, there are hormonal changes that come from eating the above (re: hgh secretion, testosterone production (both up and down) and insulin (which we knew all along)).<p>Eating little does help you lose weight, but the key is the word 'weight'. If you are beyond trying to just be a certain number on a scale and care about things like muscle, performance, body fat percentage or how you look, there are other things to consider.<p>For instance, trying to build muscle? Eat protein+carbs post working out heavy with weights. Do not eat carbs before you workout. Which means, fat+protein only before a workout.<p>Trying to lose fat? Have a long way to go? (say upper teens+ in body fat). Do very low carb (protein+fat+veggies like broccoli) for 6.5 days a week. The evening of the 7th day, eat protein+carbs (the carb refeed). do this until you like what you see in the mirror. (this is a muscle sparring approach).<p>Just trying to live a normal life and don't care about the two above (and you don't exercise much)? Generally restrict carbs to around 100g a day MAX. You aren't using them, so your body doesn't need them. If you keep giving your body carbs it doesn't need, overtime you'll get fatter. Play with the number of carbs a day, but know this is the one dial you have.<p>You'll have much better results with this than lowering the total calories.",1344733738

As I understand it, there's nothing in the DMCA requiring that a copyright holder file a takedown notice with the site before they file one with Google, since those are independent. They could file one with Google for the search results first, or they could file the notices simultaneously. That would result in sites being demoted <i>even if</i> they do comply with takedown notices, because under Google's new policy they'd be demoted just by the fact of Google having received DMCA notices.",1344733696

On his own admission he doesn't even use computers much and doesn't read the research you can find on places like pubmed. He's nearing retirement and I'm going to change my physician (in France you have to declare one to prevent people from hopping to one place from the other whenever they're ill and ""paranoid"" and save costs to our health care) once I get done with the paperwork, since I am very lazy when it comes to anything that has to do with paperwork. Btw I know all this about him because he's rather talkative and love to waste time once he's done with the check up. One thing that enforced my laziness in looking for another one is the fact that it can be good to have a physician who knows all your health history from the start, even if he's somewhat incompetent.<p>When you end up with that kind of ""doctor"" the internet doesn't look so bad.",1344733577

552192,comment,551907,552114,0,0,zmimon,,,"I remember reading about a proposal for a kind of ""good samaritan"" type law that would prevent people from being made liable through giving an apology. (I think this was specifically for medical malpractice.) It seems like a good idea.<p>I think some of this problem comes about because of ambiguity in the english language that prevents us from expressing ourselves properly.  Saying sorry can mean both that you feel regret but it also can mean that you accept responsibility, and which is which is ambiguous.  It's a shame that one can't apologize sincerely and then argue in court that your apology was the former and not the latter - but it seems you can't.<p>If we just had a better way of saying this kind of thing then I think a lot of the problem would go away.",1239159505
552191,comment,551907,551907,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I'm thinking about the times when I've been involved in a software deployment gone awry.  In highly-politicized companies, everyone points their fingers at some other person/group.  ""If they had configured the database properly....""  Nobody's taking even partial blame, so forget about apologies.  In most cases, everybody's at fault in some way, so everybody ought to be taking blame for something.  However, if one group does the ""right"" thing and admits a failure, the other groups seize the opportunity to exonerate themselves at the honest group's expense.  So, nobody wants to be the first to flinch.  How can cultures change so that the self-aware are rewarded for honesty and those in convenient denial are punished?",1239159458

552175,comment,551794,551901,0,0,patio11,,,"Important clarification for many people reading this discussion: the sticker price of a Japanese apartment is not anywhere close to the amount of money it requires to actually move into it.  I pay 45,000 yen (approximately $450) a month for my apartment in central Japan.  Its quite spacious and very much in the stix.  However, three days before movein I had to wire my landlord approximately $2,000.<p>2 months security deposit (nota bene: as a matter of course, this is not returned in this country), \n1 month rent,\n1 month finder fee, \nvarious insurance, etc, etc<p>That includes NO key money.<p>""Key money"" (礼金) is a fun little idiosyncracy of Japanese real estate that says your landlord is sort of your buddy in a new town so you should give them a little gift to ensure their good favor.  This gift can range from 1 to 3+ months rent, in cash, delivered prior to move-in.  You will never see it again.  The social justification for the tradition is long since dead (I've never even met my landlord, just the apartment referral service that handled everything) but, like all societal traditions that result in someone making money, it is shockingly durable.<p>There are other reasons I could name why a pay-by-the-day option is preferable to a traditional rented apartment (lack of a guarantor, lack of verifiable employment, etc) for folks in desperate situations, but I won't bore you too much.  Suffice it to say that I'm glad I'm not in that situation but I understand why someone in it would choose to be ""virtually"" homeless.",1239158679

While postmodern subjective morality has fundamental contradictions (as I outline in my other post here), that doesn't prove the existence of <i>an</i> objective morality.

552153,comment,551756,552031,0,0,jerf,,,"One of the great accomplishments of mathematics in the 20th century was to establish that the self-referential paradox (""This sentence is a lie"") was not merely a clever word game or unimportant paradox to be waved away as irrelevant, but a deep and profound true paradox with implications that challenged mathematics to the core and changed it forever. Merely reading a bit about Godel's proof isn't enough; you need to read enough history to realize that what was amazing about Godel's proof isn't what it proved, but instead the fact that it was a <i>proof</i>. Mathematicians and even ""normal people"" have of course known about the paradox for millennia. What Godel did was truly, finally make it inescapable. You can not have a nontrivial consistent theory while still waving away the self-referential paradox.<p>I wish this style of proof would penetrate through to postmodern philosophers. If everything that one person chooses to believe is true for them, and that person chooses to believe that there is an objective truth that precludes this statement, then you have a problem. This is not wordplay or an irrelevant point, any more than Godel's proof was. Either there <i>are</i> false statements about morality, or your claim that everything is subjectively true is also false. It's not a trivial point.<p>And I find that in practice, what gives is that postmodernists do in fact believe in absolute morality and it's all just a game to fool themselves and you into thinking otherwise. I see no reason to play that game any more, especially as I think most people would be repulsed if they took the time to work through what postmodern morality really is, instead of what it claims to be.<p>(This doesn't mean that we automatically know what the objective morality is, or whether there is one or many. It simply means that true subjective morality is fatally and irretrievably flawed. I say ""true"" because the moment you introduce an absolute, it is no longer subjective. Any absolute will do. Moralities can be quite complicated and nuanced, like utilitarianism, even as a utilitarianist must inevitably take their utility measurement as an absolute axiom. There isn't much ""absolute"" there, but it is non-zero.)<p>That said, reading the original article, I'm not sure that David Brooks would necessarily disagree with what I just wrote. I'm not sure he's advocating total relativism so much as observing that whatever concretes may exists seem to bear no particular relationship to the concretes that are claimed by anybody, religious (or aggressively non-religious), philosophical, or otherwise. I think there's a difference between merely observing and making claims about what <i>should</i> be true, and this op-ed strikes me more as an observation. So I guess I'm responding more to your comment than the article.",1239156990

3272673,comment,3271685,3272233,10,0,nitrogen,,,"I think the problem people have with Google's control over the search results is that they (perhaps mistakenly) expect Google to be an impartial facilitator for accessing the world's information.  It could be argued that organic placement of piratical content in autocomplete and instant searches is a desired outcome, as it shows the average person what's ""out there"" on the web.  Removing actually-popular searches from the autocomplete and instant results is, in a way, lying about reality.  People may be thinking, ""If they're lying about this, what else aren't they telling us?""<p>From my perspective, if those of us arguing for things like shorter copyright terms are to have any success convincing the broader public (whose access to information is largely through the media conglomerates), maybe having those people accidentally stumble upon torrent sites when they search for their favorite movie or pop idol is a good thing.<p>Not because we want them to pirate the content, but because we want them to know that technology provides another way -- that there is a conceivable, technically possible existence that doesn't depend on a controlled feed of entertainment from the existing media players.  If only they could experience the digital utopia that could be created if not for the impossibility of negotiating licenses, they might be willing to support a reform of copyright that is in the best long-term interests of society as a whole, both creators and customers.",1322099792

HN <i>is</i> unfriendly to new users who are used to the kind of interactions that predominate elsewhere.  It is in many ways a close reddit analogue, and yet even veteran redditors will find themselves downvoted to oblivion here.  I certainly did, when I first signed up.<p>Like HN, Wikipedia requires getting used to.  There is a ""Wikipedia Way"", which is very different from how people interact on other parts of the Internet.  It can seem bureaucratic and neurotic, and it is, but it keeps things running relatively smoothly for the regulars, which is the important part.  The people who take the time to learn the ropes are the ones who end up ensuring that the content is useful and informative.  Yes, some people will be put off by the fact that only reliable secondary sources can be considered when determining the notability of a subject, but the restriction is there for a reason: it keeps the crap out.<p>None of this means that Wikipedia is not open.  If you waltzed into the Linux dev channel and insisted that something be done a certain way, you'd be banned.  Linux is similarly complex, and there is a ""Linux Way"" of doing things.  Take the time to learn that way and contribute, and you'll be welcomed.  Insist they're wrong and write blog posts about how wrong they are, and you'll be ignored.",1322099784

3272661,comment,3272466,3272568,23,0,philwelch,,,"The reason is because deletion is one of the single biggest areans for status games.<p>See, from the outside, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. And there's a community there to write an encyclopedia. Sensible, no?<p>Actually, the community comes first and the encyclopedia is a side-effect. The community functions very politically, and very much like a game as well. The original intention might have been an encyclopedia with the minimum number of rules necessary to make that successful, but ultimately, the rules and red tape turned into the fun part of the game, and the encyclopedia-writing is just the grinding bit.<p>If all you wanted was a huge encyclopedia unlimited by the constraints of physical book size, you'd have a deletion policy like this: ""each statement of fact has to be cited from a reliable source, every article has to be composed entirely of statements of fact, any other content should be deleted"". So if there are no reliably-sourced statements of fact about a given subject, you don't get an article about them. If I started a Wikipedia article about my neighbor's cat and wrote a lot of outrageous claims, they would all be deleted and we'd be left with a blank article, which would probably be deleted as a relatively boring matter of procedure.<p>But what fun is that, when we can have a concept like ""notability""? Ah! Suddenly, instead of all that boring shit about citing facts and removing uncited content, and just keeping whatever reliable information we have about something, we can have a massive PvE game where you get to find articles about subjects you don't care about and declare ""this isn't notable!"", and then you can lawyer a ""consensus"" of other players into agreeing with you. Or if another player disagrees, suddenly you have a massive PvP battle! Fun! Well, at least for a certain type of person who enjoys lawyering and gets off on will-to-power stuff that motivates one to try and delete articles from an encyclopedia, which is exactly the type of person that gravitates towards the project. And--believe it or not--these kinds of highly-social games, and one's success in them on Wikipedia, are a major factor in getting elected ""administrator"", at which point your duties now entail <i>judging</i> these lawyering games and <i>actually deleting the articles</i>!",1322099584

(""Arbitration"" is Wikipedia's name for the process governing, among other things, removing administrator privileges and banning contributors for long periods of time.) Contributing to Wikipedia is a usability disaster because of all the red tape, process, policy, and other crap the core group of contributors has constructed.<p>But the project is big and popular enough, and the work is easy enough, that people still throw themselves into it. You start by just making a few small edits to something, or adding some sources and information to an article. Then it goes on a bit, and you learn some of the terminology and process, and you start feeling personally invested in it. I mean, it's Wikipedia! It has lots of information about everything! It's free! The human race needs something like this! Before you know it, you're in a ""community"" of core contributors. There are people with impressive titles like ""arbitrator"", ""administrator"", ""bureaucrat"". You start playing status games. You worry about your edit count. You try to get an article up to ""featured article"" status. You network. You try not to make enemies. You try to sound wise on ""Articles for Deletion"", or the ""Administrator's Noticeboard"", or a million different talk pages. Eventually someone nominates you for administrator. You answer a few questions and other contributors vote for you. Let's assume you played politics well enough leading up to this point. You win! Now in addition to all the crap you were doing before, you get to play with your administrator tools as well. Fun, eh? Well, for some people it is. But at that level, Wikipedia is 90% politics.

I'm no fan of piracy and I'm not an apologist for those sites at all but I don't think it's Google's place to do that. Google's mission is to index and organize the world's information and blacklisting websites like that would be hypocrisy. Even if we all agreed it was okay for one site it becomes a slippery slope where Google can use that for their own or their partners' benefit. There'd be an exodus and Google would slowly lose market share from that point on.<p>It's one thing to stop making it so easy to find a site that you barely have to type 2 letters before you get what you want. Its an entirely different thing to limit access to certain sites. If its not on Google then it doesn't exist on the Internet for all intents and purposes. We're back to emailing each other links in that case.<p>This should be as far as Google reaches on this short of banning these sites. From there it's the job of users to stop supporting piracy and law enforcement to shut down illegal sites in their own jurisdictions using the current laws and <i>without creating new laws to prosecute people unless it's absolutely positively necessary</i>.",1322096836

Unfortunately, it's also much slower.<p>In my experience with something similar - compiling LLVM to JavaScript in Emscripten, which also needs to properly implement integer math in JavaScript - it actually isn't a lot slower. On the Emscripten benchmark suite enabling overflow correction everywhere makes it only 5% slower. We might be running very different benchmarks I guess.<p>(However, overflow correction does increase code size a lot, which is why we have tools that let you get rid of it where it isn't needed.)",1322096654

I have some very high-traffic pages that differ only in a URL parameter - but the contents of the pages differ entirely. No data is duplicated, no content is duplicated, or anything.<p>A month ago, I became aware that Google was consolidating all search results for mypage.php to mypage.php?id=4, which makes no sense as the most popular page is mypage.php?id=1<p>I added a sitemap with explicit references to the different urls, added the HTML canonical URL tag to each page, went to webmaster tools and resubmitted the sitemap and each link individually, and went to webmaster tools and specified that the id query string is NOT to be ignored and specifically defined its behavior as specifying and differentiating page content.<p>A week went by and a distinct search result for mypage.php?id=1 went back into the Google results and I thought it was all over... until today when I find that all mypage.php results are being consolidated as mypage.php?id=1<p>What can I do? Where did I go wrong?<p>Search terms: ""EasyBCD"" should go to neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1 and has been in 1st place position forever. Now it's no longer there, but somewhere around position 6 is the result pointing to neosmart.net/dl.php?id=4 - a completely unrelated page. :(",1322096633

I have a business degree and worked in accounting, but decided I'd like to get back into programming after dabbling in it when I was younger. I wrote some Rails apps as side projects and put them on Github, which ended up helping quite a bit.<p>What made the difference in the end was good social skills. I met the CTO of the company I work for at a Ruby meetup, and had a good conversation with him. I ended up applying for a position he was trying to fill, and after an interview and a review of my projects on Github, I ended up with a development job without having any formal experience. I've been at it for over a year now.<p>So, this is definitely doable as long as you're committed to learning a lot, and are able to sell yourself well enough to convince someone to give you a chance.",1322096580

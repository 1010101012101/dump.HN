Newtonian systems are markov, if you know the state of the system you can run it forward in time deterministically. Even if your knowledge of the state of the Newtonian system is not fully known, you can still run the distribution of states forward in time precisely.<p>current_state = previous_state + process_noise<p>typically expressed in matrix math but the idea is as simple as that.",1404748795

7999475,comment,7998609,7999426,3,0,ep103,,,"Last time I checked (5 years ago), small satellites were a _booming_ industry, but also a very amateur / research oriented one.  While a professional military or communications organization may launch a number of small satellites, they tend to go through the same process as when they&#x27;re building a large one.  As such, most of the small sat world is focused on amateurs launching small satellites of their own design, student organizations and startups launching 1U type boxes, and research efforts for which a tiny box is sufficient.<p>As for your second question, a few points:<p>1) yes, it is massively cheaper to give your nation cell coverage via satellite as opposed to via tower.  There have been a number of success stories in Africa where a local government / business managed to put together the funds to buy a communications satellite, and overnight, the entire country has cell phones.<p>2) No, you wouldn&#x27;t do this via a small sat, you&#x27;d need a real deal communications satellite to achieve this.  One of the key features of small sats is that they are small enough that if you beg and plead enough to the powers that be, you might find room on a launch vehicle to launch your tiny satellite in some spare room.  If this service can open that  up to people who don&#x27;t have governmental / educational connections, all the better.<p>3)  There is research on creating swarms of small satellites that can communicate and act like one giant one.  That&#x27;s pretty cool.  I worked with these guys <a href=""http://www.spacecraftresearch.com/blog/?page_id=260"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacecraftresearch.com/blog/?page_id=260</a> for a time, and they were working on setting up satellites that were so small, they couldn&#x27;t even fit a real antenna on them, but figuring out basically a radio based encoding pattern so that you could pull their signal out from beneath the noise floor anyway.<p>That all said, the industry is dominated that way because of the difficulty of launching a satellite to begin with.  If you can make it easier to launch sats of any type, then people will start building those too.  Build it, and they will come.",1404748737

That is one of the most remarkable things about the universe we live in: it&#x27;s really hard to come up with compact models that are consistent with all the data.  So you can eliminate the vast majority of prospective models by eliminating those that 1) aren&#x27;t consistent with the data or 2) don&#x27;t compress the data efficiently.  What you are left with is invariably a very small number of potential models.<p>The bigger problem is people&#x27;s unwillingness to let go of their cognitive biases.  For example, economists still (AFAIK -- I don&#x27;t actually read the economics literature) make their careers publishing papers based on the efficient market hypothesis despite the fact that there is overwhelming evidence that markets are not efficient.

If you want acreage and multiple guest houses and privacy and your own vineyard and stable, you might end up west of the 280 in Woodside off of Whiskey Hill Road. This is the Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs (Jackling House), Thomas Siebel, and Gordon Moore approach. Trivia: I was talking to a general contractor last week who said Gordon Moore&#x27;s home upgrades/maintenance on his estate in a private valley on the north end of Woodside kept his business afloat during the 2008 downturn. If you want significant acreage, you&#x27;ll need to budget tens of millions.<p>But in Woodside you don&#x27;t get very much within walking or horseback distance, except Roberts Market/Bucks/Woodside Cafe.

A defective battery is something that is covered in the warranty, so you could get it repaired, but instead you return it.  I understand if you would have had a shitty experience overall, and the battery was the proverbial last straw, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case from your post.<p>You list 5 problems, 2 of which are fixed, 1 which is a production defect that can be repaired at no cost to you, and 1 of which you yourself say &quot;it isn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it once was.&quot;.  Overall, you have 1 decent point (the keyboard), and if you had used that point as your reason to return your Surface, that would have been perfectly valid.  Instead you use the one thing covered by warranty as your primary reason in the summary at the top.  It&#x27;s possible you intended this to come across differently, but in that case you need to elaborate some more.<p>Windows 8 on a desktop and on a tablet are very different animals, purely because of the way you interact with them.  Windows 8 has special controls for touch, which you don&#x27;t usually see on desktop.  That&#x27;s why 2 weeks is still a short time to spend with it before declaring it bad.  Try a bit longer, there is logic in there, it&#x27;s just unfamiliar.<p>As for tips, you could have expanded on the steps you took for your issues, so it would be more balanced against the bad parts of the review.<p>I understand the concern about the return policy, and I don&#x27;t see any problems with returned a product you&#x27;re not happy with.  I just wish you would have written a more balanced article with more reasoning behind it and a better indication of what you liked.  The current version reads too much like &quot;There were some good parts, but most of it was literally worse than Satan&quot;, mostly because it&#x27;s a list of issues rather than a review.

I grew up in SF and came back because I have family here, but I find the irrational aversion to LA from SF extremely irritating.<p>LA does have somewhat dirty air, compared to SF, this is true.  However, out by the coasts, it&#x27;s not too bad, and the water quality at the beaches is actually very high (it has improved immensely over the years, but perception hasn&#x27;t quite caught up).  LA also has a lot of old neighborhoods with a really cool vibe.  Hiking and more remote beaches aren&#x27;t nearly as difficult to come by as people up here think, and the beach towns (Manhattan, Hermosa, and so forth) are pretty great.  Also, people in LA don&#x27;t start sentences with &quot;as a fourth generation native LA resident&quot; crap that is truly irritating in SF, and they don&#x27;t seem to think that &quot;right to move&quot; is unidirectional (we can move out, but nobody&#x27;s allowed to move inâ€¦ I&#x27;m looking at you, Seattle).  LA is also adding more and more density, getting more urban (as the bay area sprawls out due to severe building constraints).<p>Also, there&#x27;s quite a bit of very interesting and creative work here.  I worked for a film compositing software company, and it was kind of great.<p>With electric cars on the way?  Eh, maybe some days LA will get its air quality under control.  Then it really will be a huge, traffic clogged, overcrowded, clean, creative gem of a cityâ€¦ well, at least parts of it.<p>Ok, one thing - I&#x27;ve been hard on SF here, but that&#x27;s because this is a particular issue where I think SF residents have it totally wrong.  On the balance, I actually do think SF is a beautiful place - it&#x27;s got problems, but the undeveloped coast, redwood forests, hills over the bay, and so forth are also spectacular, and some sections of the city are historic, dense, urban, and walkable in a way that you still don&#x27;t really find almost anywhere else west of the Mississippi.

Even smaller than a Falcon 1.<p>Beal Aerospace also tried to bring pressure fed composite launchers in the nineties, though he used hydrogen peroxide and kerosene:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beal_Aerospace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beal_Aerospace</a><p>While methane has the advantage of self-pressurization, it is also about half the density of kerosene, meaning there will be double the volume for the same mass, and the pressure vessel will be double the mass. Pressure vessel mass is proportional to volume and pressure. That&#x27;s why Beal used very dense fuels, even when they have less exhaust velocity.<p>The heavy tank is a worse problem for sea-level launched rockets that need high engine pressures to reach passable engine exhaust velocities.<p>The rocket equation shows that exhaust velocity is important to reach high rocket velocities:\ndelta v = v_exhaust * ln(m_full / m_empty)<p>In a pressure fed rocket the engine pressure is the tank pressure (minus some pressure loss in the injector). If you air launched, it might be a bit easier, since ambient pressure is only a quarter of sea level at 10 km. Airlaunch LLC tried to use these synergistic technologies some years ago: \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirLaunch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirLaunch</a><p>Basically in the atmosphere you exhaust at ambient pressure (or not very far from it). If your chamber pressure is low, then you can&#x27;t expand much before you&#x27;re at ambient at sea level. Thus the nozzle can&#x27;t produce much thrust for the propellant flow. The upshot is that low pressure rockets suck at low altitudes.<p>But for relatively small rockets it might work well: apparently because of some minimum-gauge issues, they need to have pretty thick walls anyway so going to pressure fed is not such a huge overhead. Also equipment like turbopumps does not scale well at the low end. (I haven&#x27;t studies this in detail though.)<p>Armadillo Aerospace has tested oxygen-methane self pressurized rockets years ago and they are simple and work well. They can also be controlled precisely. NASA bought one from them and flies it occasionally. I think it is a blow down pressurized version though (helium is filled directly to the main propellant tank head spaces for pressurization):\n<a href=""http://morpheuslander.jsc.nasa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://morpheuslander.jsc.nasa.gov/</a><p>So auto-pressurization is nothing fancy, in fact it can be seen as a simpler version of blowdown pressurization, which is simpler than regulated pressurization.<p>If I had to create an orbital launcher with minimum capital, this is a reasonable design, though I&#x27;m skeptical about the aerospike.<p>To convince me, they need to first fly some sounding rockets.<p>There&#x27;s been many rocket startups in the recent decades, with little flying hardware, and even that has been no guarantee of going further.",1404746026

And because the money has already been taken out, you can be more detrimentally effected; the bank has to investigate and decide to give you your money back, basically, which takes time (and hopefully you have an uncompromised account if you need to pay bills or whathaveyou) whereas with credit cards the bank has to investigate and decide it&#x27;s not actually fraudulent behavior and re-charge you (not sure how all that works though).

Sounds like a top heavy organisation to me.<p>Reminds me of a project a collegue was involved in at work (which is at a big established firm).  This had; 1 programmer, 1 manger (who requested more  technical staff cause he knew 1 programmer wasn't enough but was turned down), and 2 project managers. As the project was running furhter behind schedule (due to agressive scheduling and vague requirements and  mainly because lone programmer was in status meetings ever day), various high-level management were thrown at the problem.<p>Eventually, the programmer spent about 1/2 his day in meetings about the project, with his manager, 2 project managers, 1 VP, 2 senior VP's. Project was never finished ... \n",1190930215

Didn't build a single product or hirer any developers. Went to Bubblecon 2008 to raise some VC with my army of consultants. With $20 million in the bank I then bought Super Bowl Ads until I got acquired. Yay!\n",1190929950

60365,comment,60109,60338,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yeah, I did the same with my web app scalability contracting work...started at $95/hr, and kept that rate for years, but then when I started getting sick of the business, I started cranking it up.  By the end I was charging $150/hr for local work and $3k/day minimum for ""have to fly to get there"" jobs, and hadn't lost any customers--I was still saying, ""No, I can't get out to see you until the week after next, but I'll fix the particular problem you've mentioned remotely tonight when I get back into the office.""",1190929244
60364,comment,60109,60225,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed.  My girlfriend thought I was crazy when I started turning down $1000/day local contracts and $3000/day ""get on a plane"" contracts to instead work on Virtualmin (for no money for the first several months, and until recently very little money).",1190928924

60361,comment,60326,60326,0,0,neilc,,,"I think the author is almost right: Google's vulnerability is its dependence on advertising for its revenue stream, but I don't think widespread adoption of ad blocking software is very likely: most people don't care, and/or don't have the knowledge to install browser extensions. Text-based ads are also harder to block, and it will just lead to an arms race in which only a small portion of users will bother to take the measures necessary to block all/most ads.<p>But I <i>do</i> think Google is vulnerable to a collapse in the web advertising market. Look at all the pain that was caused the last time this happened (didn't we learn our lesson about building businesses that are totally dependent on advertising income?). If the advertising market were to collapse, what would Google do? (I'm genuinely curious to hear speculation about this...)",1190928344

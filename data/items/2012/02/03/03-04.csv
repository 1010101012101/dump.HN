I'm a US citizen living in Australia, and was landing in San Fran for a 3 week visit about 8 years ago.  As required by law, I travel on my US passport in and out of the US, so no problem right?  But no, I start getting the third degree about what I do with myself - ""I'm a student at the University of Melbourne"" - ""What is that?  A college?  What's Melbourne?"" - err, where I just came from, and its best known University.",1328241585

3545678,comment,3544015,3545571,1,0,kls,,,"It is not the points, rather it may be an indicator of a trend among the demographic of individuals. For example say I participated in a car club, where all members where experts at vehicle technology and then over time said BMW jerks took over more and more, the information would start to reflect their preference (BMW tech) and thought process and at some point there will be a event horizon where it seems like all car club members are jerks and all information was being presented by jerks who think so little of opposing viewpoint that they would disable your car, for something as petty as making a point that maybe a particular Mercedes technology is superior. I personally don't like information that is biased by ego. I am not saying that HN is close to that, but it was not long ago that the thought of someone systematically down-voting another member in HN would be unheard-of. My point was not that I am on the cusp of leaving but rather I share the concern that with HN's growth we have to be aware of possible decline in quality and discuss ways to ensure the quality that HN provides.",1328241548

3545676,comment,3545457,3545634,1,0,eck,,,"Fishy but not unexpected.  Online publications always switch off comments when they see a huge traffic bump and realize they have made fools of themselves and are being told as much in the comments.<p>For example, a few weeks ago the NYTimes Public Editor made a blog post about whether it should be their policy to note in articles when public figures are obviously lying in their remarks.  (They're worried about seeming like the liberal media and they think they should ""fairly balance"" truth and fiction on issues like climate change or what percentage of planned parenthood's money is spent on abortions.)  This resulted in immediate outrage from the commenters and vicious comments.  Not profanity -- articulate rebuttals that just made the NYTimes look like idiots.  Comments switched off.  Later they attempted to walk it back, poorly.  Same articulate rebuttals, NYTimes look like idiots again.  Comments switched off even faster.

I'm not really into customizing my system all that much either so it wasn't that either. It's Lion that has me a little upset.<p>First off, Lion has replaced GCC with LLVM which for the most part is fine but I was doing some work with Ruby that I started on my Linux machine then when I cloned it on my Mac (which is where I do the majority of my work) I had problems with Rubygems and RVM. This was due to me having the latest Xcode 4.2. I was getting a weird Posix error because some gems needed to be compiled with GCC. So then I had to remove Xcode, get GCC as a standalone install and I'm still stuck with errors. Most things work but the other day I just wanted to deploy a new Octopress blog and rake generate throws a long list of errors at me. So that was the first time I was truly upset with Mac.<p>Then the other little things are:<p>- inability to save or rename files without a name (as in .htaccess). I always have to open my main text editor for that as you can't rename files that way nor does TextEdit allow that<p>- no more ""Save as""<p>Showing hidden files got a little harder too and then there were some general quirks that made it seem like the OS was babysitting me and not letting me just do what I knew I wanted to do. For the most part I'm over those and I love my Mac to death but I'm still pissd about how much of a chore it is to get RVM and Runygems working in Lion.",1328241533

But only when it allows reversible computing. I don't know how practical that is though. Anyways I've separated out the parts of the list which I think are less common. And listed examples off the top of my head so by no means is the below meant to be exhaustive.<p>The uncommon ones:<p>* <i>Units </i>- F# and Frink<p>* <i>homoiconicity</i> - Lisps, Prolog, Io, Factor, Pure?, ...<p>* <i>macros and extensible syntax</i> - the above list, Nemerle, Dylan<p>* <i>Unification </i>- Prolog, Mercury - logic languages. anyone with type inference. anyone with predicate dispatch, a full example of which I do not know. F# Active patterns and scala extractors are close.<p>* <i>Error (managing numeric Imprecision) </i>- Best I can understand I can only note that I have seen people treat similar concepts with monads. So haskell and any language which allows easy monads. So scala, f#, haskell, clojure, nemerle<p>* <i>Math types</i> - Axiom/Aldor. To an extent, dependently typed languages - not practical. yet?<p>* <i>Polymorphism </i>- Although it sounds more like structural typing. So OCaml, Scala. Also F#, haskell partially.<p>* <i>Aspects </i>- Metaprogramming makes this relatively easy and clean to implement. so anyone with macros too. Arguably, monads are another way to follow the same philosophy.<p>* <i>term rewriting </i>- not common, very niche and not mentioned, but pure-lang allows this and for abstract math programming it is a really fun & powerful concept.<p>* <i>pluggable types</i> - F# has this as type providers. Gosu open types. I have used it in F#. At a start, it is a very awesome way to consume an api.<p>Less Uncommon:<p>* <i>pattern matching </i>- most functional languages. to a small extent the java.nexts<p>* <i>Immutable values</i> - most functional languages<p>* <i>Parser </i>- parser combinators or any language which implements PEGs e.g. Nemerle<p>* <i>Design by contract</i> - eiffel and as a library in most languages<p>* <i>laziness </i>- the usual functional suspects.",1328241296

I'm a PHP dev and I have to admit, PHP isn't cool. It's thought of as a language for bad programmers because it's so easy for beginners to pick up. That's precisely the reason why I'm a PHP developer to begin with! And boy have I given ammunition to the side that argues that PHP is a ""bad programmers language"". But oh well. That's really a good thing that total newbies can pick it up in a week like I did some years back.<p>But really no one cares about your language except other people with chips on their shoulders too.

You're making a distinction between two kinds of code bloat: the kind that comes from verbose languages and the kind that comes from duplication.<p>I don't know of any way to separate these. Look at it this way: to make small systems, we need both powerful languages <i>and</i> good programmers.<p>If you don't get to choose what language to write in (as is the case on most software projects), it's still better to write less code. But how can we measure the impact of language choice? I don't think we can. You'd have to write the system twice, holding the other variables constant. But writing the system once already changes everything.<p>I don't disagree with you about the importance of good abstractions for reducing code size. Where we might disagree a bit is on the influence of programming language on what abstractions get created. It's fashionable in the industry to downplay the importance of language (algorithms matter more, libraries matter more, programmers matter more - pretty much everything is supposed to matter more). But I think the language we're writing in influences the kind of thing we write, and thus the kind of thing we think, all the way up to how we conceptualize the problem. Maybe it isn't the strongest influence at any point, yet it's compounded over every decision made in the lifetime of the system. Once a system has passed the embryonic stage, by far the most important factor in how it develops further is how the existing parts already work. Language seems to me deeply involved in conditioning this trajectory - why the system grows this way and not another. Not every idea is equally likely in every medium. I think we see this in the fact that distinct languages give rise to such distinct programming cultures.<p>As an aside, this is something the typical way of comparing languages -- juxtapose a known algorithm written in X to the same thing written in Y -- fails to address.",1328239659

3545565,comment,3542415,3545454,1,0,eldude,,,"I'm distinguishing between a ""monopoly"" as is used commonly (and loosely) like in this case to describe Google and a true monopoly, which by definition no one is able to compete with equally, like the US federal government. I think that ""monopolies"" (Google, any entity that doesn't use the government backed by force to protect it from having to compete equally) are okay, but a monopoly is not, and is prone to corruption, thus our founding fathers' belief in limited government.<p>This isn't my disagreeing with the judge, this is my disagreeing with their right to try Google in the first place, a power which _no_ government should have: the right to try and punish someone for a future intention of exercising one's property rights. It is France's violation of these human rights which I find reprehensible.<p>Regarding ""monopolies"" having no restrictions placed on them, this is true in the extent that the government is concerned. The government should neither help nor restrain individual businesses, and should instead create an equal environment where property and contract rights are enforced, and companies are not found guilty of success by the greed of others with a government that sanctions such greed.<p>I highlighted the definition of a monopoly, because everyone is throwing that word around without any regard for its meaning. Google does not have exclusive ownership of maps through any legal sanction; It does not have command of supply as a Google map is a combination of bits and knowledge of information that is freely available to _anyone_ that would take the time and had the incentive to assemble them; There is no concerted action as there's no 2nd party with which Google has been acting with.<p>Finally, I never said a monopoly is beholden to _a_ customer, but instead to _its_  costomer_s_. A company in a free market cannot exist in perpetuity without providing some value for which someone will trade their money for. So long as both parties are free to trade value for value, no monopoly exists.<p>I enjoyed your response by the way.",1328239078

3545561,comment,3542507,3545316,1,0,genbattle,,,"I think this is a case of not being able to have your cake and eat it too; you can make something easier to use, but it usually comes as a compromise to more expert users because you have to simplify the interface, remove functionality, reduce configuration options, etc. Conversely, adding more power will usually mean increasing the difficulty for beginners; if you require that users are comfortable with using a semi-programming language to write configuration files, you get more options and more power than you could via a simple and straightforward gui.<p>In the end I don't think either approach is better, just different. To address your first statement, I think editors can either choose to become better for experts in a particular domain, or they can choose to be easier to learn for beginners, or some compromise between the two. I have yet to see an application that manages to do both.<p>I agree that someone's subjective opinion of editors other than the one(s) they use is not very useful, but i don't think that was the point of the post you replied to. He was simply stating what I stated above; an app that is good for a beginner is not necessarily the best for an expert, and in the end you have to find some compromise between the two.<p>EDIT:\nFor the record, I think vim has a pretty good learning curve; vimtutor is great, and you only really need to know the most basic parts of modal switching for gvim to be used like any other text editor. Once you gain some mastery of things like movement command, macros, markers, etc. you can really start to accelerate your workflow.

However, I think you're not quite addressing my point, which is that violating DRY (by not using high level abstractions) is worse than verbosity.<p>Is it verbosity that is the best measure of complexity, or is it code size?

When I asked about their costs they told me that although most of the components (lenses, energy units & wiring etc) were produced locally, the chips that converted light & thermal signatures to vision were imported, and they cost a lot.

I think that might be all: each piece can contain 4, 2, 1 or 1/2 of the original square's corners, since (lacuna) all pieces must contain the same number of corners and further subdividing the corners (into 1/3s, say) would mean some pieces don't touch the centre (another lacuna).",1306414608

2587522,comment,2586586,2586586,4,0,bane,,,"Something to keep in mind with Tufte's ideas is that, while he has many wonderful ways of thinking about visualizing data, often it's hard to generalize his concepts into a simple set of general purpose visualizations, suitable for use on a variety of problems. Instead, you find yourself seeking to find a way to display data in as ""Tufte"" a way as possible, which more of than not means a discrete visualization for every kind of data you have.<p>This becomes a problem in data visualization software, where the number of data visualizations is far less than the number of possible datasets of interest. So many datasets will tend to map to very few visualizations: bar chart, scatter chart, both with a time series, relatively uncomplex graphs of low connectivity density, etc.<p>You can see Tufte has this problem himself, with his singular ""invention"" the sparkline really just being a form of a tiny time series line graph. Which is cool, but it's not particularly earth shattering.<p>My takeaway has always been to be mindful of Tufte's analysis, but don't be slavish to it unless you <i>can</i> produce a unique visualization for each kind of data.",1306414164

2587520,comment,2587403,2587403,8,0,wccrawford,,,"I think this is pretty much spot-on.  I've always called it 'removing the pain-points' because any time I get sick of something, I automate it.  Sometimes that's after 3 times, and sometimes it's 100.  But if I start to hate it, I automate it.<p>I do choose to remove some of the pain points differently, though.<p>I write things in the newest languages at home, rather than at work.  Anything I do at work should be re-usable by anyone on the team, and that's hard if it's in some fancy new language that nobody else has looked into yet.<p>Rather than sort through email manually, I set up filters.  Then I scan the subjects of all the new emails in that tag, read the ones that are important, and then mark the rest read all at once.  (I don't have to archive because I set my filtered email to never hit the in-box.)  GMail has some nice shortcuts as he noted.  I use this to mark all unread messages as read:  <i>UI</i>N  (Select all unread, mark read, unselect.)<p>I also streamline anything I'm asked to do repeatedly, like add new fields to a form.  I know I'm going to be asked to do this constantly, so now it's just a matter of adding a little metadata and the rest happens automatically.<p>And I also put everything I can into the hands of others, so long as it doesn't involve changing code.  If there's a list of Titles that change a lot, I give the ability to change them to whoever requests it.  (Business rules are what stop them anyhow, not me.)  Then I don't have to do that any more.  (That's rather simplistic, but I can't give more elaborate examples for fear of breaking my NDA.)",1306414127

The film should have a brightness, a crispness and sparkle that makes an impact. It should look like a movie! -- not a mediocre big-screen television.""<p>Note how the Ebert cites his 'gut' evidence right at the bottom of the article.  This is not by accident - but a master stroke.  For why would you admit that you have no pragmatic basis for your outrage at the beginning of the article?

It's called ""wire"".<p>https://github.com/radiosilence/wire (MIT Licensed)<p>Because Facebook, SMS, E-mail, Twitter etc are all utterly compromised and untrustworthy for political purposes, I thought that people needed a new system to post events, register activity, message each other (with optional encryption).<p>There are options out there but honestly I think uptake is low because the majority of activists are not hugely technically competent and whilst I2P, PGP et all are fantastic in their own right, they aren't really feasible for the average political protester.<p>So the idea is to build a system that is simple to use, anonymous (IE no IPs logged), and provides some neat features that would otherwise be unavailable to the average activist (such as encryption, self-destructing messages, destruct keys, etc).<p>The entire site will be hosted using SSL on my server, but there will be instructions for easy deployment to other servers should people wish to set up their own installations (for security, trust, which is understandable).<p>Currently the UI is fairly minimal and modelled to be familiar to people who've used Facebook for events and messaging. Conversation is done in the form of flat threads (currently) between as many people as desired (people can be added to conversations).<p>It's built on Redis and Python/Flask. Encryption is done using AES-256 and a custom PBKDF algorithm based on stretched Whirlpool, so it's exceptionally secure.<p>Without HTTPS enabled (to actually benchmark the script), it can perform about 1000 requests per second on my tiny server, but obviously it can scale, because of the back-end technology used.<p>Currently got a landing page set up at:<p>https://wire-bbs.org<p>But if anyone's interested in the code or contributing, check out the GitHub repository.<p>Screenshots:<p>https://wire-bbs.org/event_screen.png<p>https://wire-bbs.org/thread.png<p>https://wire-bbs.org/inbox.png<p>https://wire-bbs.org/create_event.png<p>Most of the feedback I've been getting is on the design, though what would be nice is the more experienced technical people advising me on some logistics and reviewing whether my security is sufficient (methods of encryption, key differentiation, etc).<p>Another idea I had was to be able to store messages purely in memcached, so if the server was shut off/restarted, any messages in memory would be lost. However, a friend said that memcached stuff would still be paged, which means being written to HDD - this is bad, obviously.<p>How else could I get some traction for this project?

I think they're called the ""x"" and ""y"" theories--one is the one you just cited, and one is the theory that people like to work, and are intrinsically motivated to do a good job. Of course, business culture does seem centered around the more pessimistic theory which you outlined.",1282856398

Whatever clarity of thought and healthy skepticism I have developed, I give most of the credit to the great teachers who challenged me.  It is misguided to tell most high school students to go and learn completely by themselves.  Disregarding the motivation that school brings, someone that opts instead to study alone in their room runs the risk of fooling themselves -- the risk of not really getting the point, or not asking the right questions, or being just plain wrong (for long periods of time) without even realizing it.",1282856354

1637116,comment,1636099,1637001,2,0,telemachos,,,"Are you sure about that? <i>.rvm/scripts/cd</i> still has this at the top [1]:<p><pre><code>    # Source a .rvmrc file in a directory after changing to it, if it exists.
    # To disable this fature, set rvm_project_rvmrc=0 in $HOME/.rvmrc
</code></pre>
Also, the new security features that Wayne mentions in this post suggest that a <i>cd</i> automatically leads to a check on the directory you <i>cd</i> into. Doesn't that imply that rvm still has to plug itself into <i>cd</i>? (I may be confused here.)<p>I have to admit the <i>cd</i> thing ended up throwing me for an interesting loop at one point. I was scripting and no matter what happened, <i>cd</i> was returning 0 (success) - even when the <i>cd</i> command was actually failing. I could not figure out for the life of me why the right exit status wasn't being reported. It turns out that <i>rvm</i> wasn't saving and then returning the exit status of <i>cd</i> itself. (So the exit status I was capturing wasn't <i>actually</i> that of <i>cd</i>.)<p>Long story short, two minutes in #rvm and Wayne had it fixed [2].<p><i>Edit</i>: I think I see the confusion. Cldwalker is saying that he doesn't like <i>rvm</i> tinkering with <i>cd</i>.  Bgentry is saying that <i>rvm</i> no longer automatically switches Ruby if it finds a .rvmrc in a folder (after you <i>cd</i> into it). That's right, but it doesn't change what is bothering Cldwalker: <i>rvm</i> does in fact still get in front of <i>cd</i>. (I think 'hijacking' is too strong, but I know what Cldwalker means by it.) If you use <i>rvm</i>, then by default every time you issue <i>cd</i>, <i>rvm</i> runs the code in [1] (part of which obviously punts to the built-in <i>cd</i>). You can disable this behavior, as Cldwalker says, by setting the environment variable <i>rvm_project_rvmrc</i> to 0. Unless I'm wrong, the default is still on.<p>[1] <a href=""http://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/blob/master/scripts/cd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/blob/master/scripts/cd</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/f9aa3adebcca547924c8095fa7696967bd2d8d15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/f9aa3adebcca547924...</a>",1282855541

Instead, only the patch # is incremented on that branch, again about once a day.<p>So for example, the current stable release is milestone 5. This was built from the 375 branch.

1637013,comment,1635670,1636729,0,0,fr0man,,,"Here are a couple of scientific articles from two of the more well respected science organizations in the world.  There are a plethora more, though it's hard to wade through the opinion pieces, which are far more numerous.  The general consensus among the experts is human activity does have something to do with global warming.  And there is a ton of direct evidence.  In my mind (I'm not a climate scientist, but as a biologist I have been exposed to a lot of the research over the last 15 years or so), the question isn't so much <i>are</i> we contributing to global warming as it is <i>how much</i> we're contributing to global warming.<p>Like it or not politically, the way science works within a scientific community on issues like this is driven by the consensus of the expert community, which is informed by the data.  Granted, it's easier to get published in a peer reviewed journal with an article that supports global warming than one that tries to debunk it, but in a scientific forum the data will eventually stand up on its own. If someone uncovers a preponderance of empirical data that contradicts human contribution to global warming, it will stand up to scientific scrutiny. The best example of a paradigm changing finding of this sort that I can think of in modern science is punctuated equilibrium.  A lot of the evolutionary biology community screamed bloody murder at first, but the data were just too compelling to ignore.   
Unfortunately, on global warming the data all point in the opposite direction right now, i.e. global warming <i>is</i> happening and we as humans <i>are</i> contributing to it.<p><a href=""http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/News_and_Issues/Science_Issues/Climate_change/climate_facts_and_fictions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686</a>",1282853149

1636997,comment,1634471,1635878,0,0,elblanco,,,"I agree, it's a bit of a meta-comment on the sad state of the Apple user-community. I read through probably a full 100 comments in this thread and found myself become more and more annoyed at the lack of basic critical thinking on display. In particular, Apple's done an interesting thing with the LED scheme on some of their hardware. It's a nice touch. It <i>deserves</i> to be noticed. It's interesting that it has never really been copied. Perhaps Apple's industrial design is really a generation or two ahead of the rest of the industry -- that's noteworthy and praiseworthy.<p>But an interesting LED scheme is immediately extrapolated in the article and by the vast majority of the posts here as indicative of the <i>overall</i> attention to detail Apple puts into its products. I'm simply trying to point out that this extrapolation is nonsensical and wrong by bringing up that Apple actually is good at detail in some areas, not so good in others. Therefore, attention to the detail in how the lights blink is not necessarily indicative of attention to detail in <i>all</i> areas. That seems pretty straightforward and logical to me. Supporting my supposition that critical thinking is clearly not part of the grotesque fawning going on here, here is the kinds of responses I get for putting forward an entirely logical, critical statement.<p>dieterrams - who is about as gushing a fanboy as the Apple ecosystem can produce.<p><i>""Your criticism is silly, and smacks of typical, petty anti-Apple resentment.""</i><p><i>""You lost any pretense of trying to provide the voice of reason here.""</i><p>This is the same person who's response to the OT was <i>""The moment I realized the LED was mimicking breathing (I first experienced it with a white iMac) was the moment I realized just how far Apple goes to make computers for humans. Truly personal computers.""</i> Very poetic and followed by a few dozen responses about how, yes, Apple is truly breathtaking and Ive and Jobs are geniuses, etc. etc.<p>epochwolf & powrtoch - who both asked a variation of the same question.<p>""Would you mind providing a few examples instead of citing an amorphous large list?""<p>And at risk of incurring more downvotes from the dieterrams of the world, I responded that no, I won't. All anybody has to do is use their products and read a bit of tech news. Apple's products are full of problems and issues. From lower than average hardware reliability for the industry to wireless signal loss, industry trailing video card drivers or just outright poor design decisions like various gafaws with their input devices -- even things that simple extended reliability testing should expose occur far too frequently and don't appear nearly as often in competitor's products like poor material selection.

If they are truly co-founders and not just early employees with a lot of stock, they have to believe the idea is just as much theirs as it is yours.<p>I'm moving to SF soon hoping to team up with some co-founders.  But I'm not going with any preconceived ideas of what kind of startup I want to pursue.",1179488956

I was also inspired by Richard Hamming ``You and Your Research''<p>""Age is another factor which the physicists particularly worry about. They always are saying that you have got to do it when you are young or you will never do it. Einstein did things very early, and all the quantum mechanic fellows were disgustingly young when they did their best work. Most mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and astrophysicists do what we consider their best work when they are young. It is not that they don't do good work in their old age but what we value most is often what they did early. On the other hand, in music, politics and literature, often what we consider their best work was done late. I don't know how whatever field you are in fits this scale, but age has some effect.""<p>I'm sure there are plenty of counter-examples, yes.",1179488051

The phrase has been thought about so much and repeated so often that I would think the negative would no longer be ignored, although on the first read it may have an affect of a Be Evil command.

Usually the reason is that I am not really hungry when I get up or before I leave for work. I could probably eat breakfast later after I get to work but then my choices are not as good/healthy. I usually just skip it. I am going to try this as a breakfast once I get to work.<p>I usually spend $8-10 a day going to lunch. I could certainly save some money by packing a lunch but I don&#x27;t do it. So I eat out. I also don&#x27;t always make the right choices at lunch. I often pick convenient over healthy. And I tend to eat too much of it. I am going to try this as a lunch at work. I think it might help me.<p>We usually have a decent home cooked meal for dinner at my house so, other than an initial attempt to go a few weeks on 100% Soylent, I am probably not going to have this for dinner very often. It won&#x27;t really save me time/money as I&#x27;ll already be cooking for the rest of the family.<p>So that is why <i>I</i> want to use this.",1399402561
7706391,comment,7705419,7705842,1,0,aliakbarkhan,,,"Why do you think the 4chan source would be any less awful? If you&#x27;re really curious you can look at the partial source that leaked a while back, but IIRC it&#x27;s not exactly amazing. (I&#x27;m paranoid, so I won&#x27;t link to it but it&#x27;s trivial to find with Google.) Edit: Just saw that you&#x27;ve already seen it. Nonetheless, my other points still stand.<p>At any rate, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be seeing an open source release of the 4chan source in the near future. Obviously I don&#x27;t know the specifics, but in my experience it seems like most purpose-built internal applications like the 4chan imageboard tend to be rather messy and filled with a lot of very specific code that&#x27;s hard to repurpose for more general use. In order to release it publicly, the codebase has to be sanitized of private information, disentangled from any internal utilities or applications, refactored to remove ugly hacks that solve one-off problems (ex. legacy integration), and so on. Then they have to switch 4chan itself over to the new codebase if they ever hope to keep the public repo up to date. That&#x27;s a lot of work for 4chan&#x27;s volunteer labor force, on top of what they already have to expend to maintain the site.<p>There&#x27;s also a good likelihood that the volunteers who contributed to the code have not done so in a way that would allow moot to release the source. I am not a lawyer so I can&#x27;t speak confidently about this, but I&#x27;m pretty sure copyright is a major issue here. Unless every volunteer contributor has explicitly agreed to allow their code to be released or directly assigned copyright to moot, the first prerequisite to an FOSS release would probably be to get that permission from every contributor, both past and present. The present contributors may not be that hard to ask, but given the nature of 4chan I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a few past volunteers have worked under personas they&#x27;ve since abandoned, effectively making them unreachable.",1399402551

He replied that what he was looking for was someone who would&#x27;ve relied on an existing solution to solve the problem instead of trying to code it all from scratch.

If you are going to have a lot of info show on any one place, you&#x27;d better direct the viewer&#x27;s attention.<p>I would keep the different contrast levels, but would do it differently.<p>Right now my there are several levels. My eyes are directed to page title and the words I searched for. Page title doesn&#x27;t really help that much for most pages (unless I&#x27;m looking for something quite unspecific) and I already know the keywords I looked for. Right now I go to the keyword in a three line summary and have to find where does it fit; I begin reading from the middle, it&#x27;s more exhausting and potentially slower<p>Page title is less important than the text surrounding the term I looked for and the domain name of the site.

I would try to cluster the results based on that, so &quot;man top&quot; returns clusters of linux help and of clothing and the user selects what he meant, filtering out the noise.<p>I don&#x27;t know how taxing that would be, but not every page has to be indexed this way. Even 10% of the index having these keywords would be statistically significant to build the clusters. The keywords from this index would be highlighted in the results. Search could be machine tailored in case the user decide to go deeper than the 10%, so as to return documents likely to belong to the cluster, but not processed into it.",1399402415

Whether or not they <i>work</i>, this is simply true. It is not an effective defense of political authority to point out &quot;All social organisation systems use political authority and are thus vulnerable to the same criticisms as our current system with its dangerously wielded political authority&quot;.<p>You&#x27;ve then gone on a very long back and forward with me over the various ways in which you think it might fail until terminating at this conclusion, that being; &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that the common responses to these questions which have already been raised are valid from a game theory perspective&quot; with some ad hominem about my understanding of what game theory actually is thrown in for good measure. And a restatement of the frequently proven wrong point that I am utterly convinced that this is the way that things would turn out in reality.<p>To rebuke that, again, and thoroughly this time because I think we&#x27;ve reached the point at which continuing this discussion is pointless; Merely being completely convinced that political authority in any system is an achilles heel does not carry over into believing that one potential post political system is <i>definitely</i> the one true path forward. When a religious narrative for the origin of the species is discarded on scientific grounds, and one believes that the most promising current theory is the scientific theory of evolution, even in the event that they turn out to be wrong about the latter does not automatically make them wrong about the former.<p>Succinctly, that is to say that I am utterly certain that the politicians are wrong, but not utterly certain that I and those who think as I do are right.<p>With regards to the fact that you don&#x27;t accept the common rebuttals to one of the commonly raised objections within anarchocapitalism, that&#x27;s your prerogative. I can&#x27;t say that I find your handwaving over &quot;you&#x27;re getting game theory wrong&quot; a particularly convincing argument that you are right, but I have no real desire to try and sway you from your position. What we think largely doesn&#x27;t matter, it is likely it <i>will</i> be tried in reality and at this point all the game theory handwaving in the world will not make a difference, one of us will be wrong, and one of us will be right.<p>Until then, we have our positions.",1399402265

In Rust `&&#x27;static str` and `StrBuf` are on more equal footing, so it&#x27;s not necessary to place objects on the heap to make it easier to work with them. Still, some people do it accidentally, so we&#x27;ve recently made some changes to make it harder to shoot yourself in the foot in terms of performance, most notably removing the `~&quot;foo&quot;` syntax for heap allocated string literals (which also had the side effect of making the language easier to read).",1399401323

It depends strongly on the shoe, wearer, and various failure modes (and how repairable / expensive to repair each of those failure modes is). In my own case, I&#x27;ve generally found that the expensive shoes fail to save money, because even though they&#x27;re more repairable, the cost of repairs eats up any savings, vs. just treating shoes as a disposable good (might be different if I lived somewhere with lower labor costs; around here even a simple resoling costs $50, and anything more involved starts at $100+). That might still be worth it if you prefer the nice shoes, don&#x27;t like unnecessarily sending things to landfills, or other reasons, but for me, from a strictly cost standpoint I&#x27;ve found it hard to come out ahead.",1399401193

If Google won&#x27;t tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong, how am I supposed to fix it?<p>Yes there are publishers out there who game the system and deserve to be banned, but there are also publishers out there who try to follow the rules as best they can, and sometimes they make mistakes. But Google won&#x27;t tell us which mistakes we make.<p>People use AdSense to make a livelihood doing something they enjoy doing, and when that gets taken away from them via an automated email that doesn&#x27;t explain anything, it&#x27;s extremely disappointing and may lead to backlash.<p>Transparency and some leniency would go a very, very long way.

A lot of the features and boards could be coded as modules and it seems like it would be a lot easier to maintain, but of course this is mostly speculation.

It is based on non-production JVM and does <i>not</i> use the same algorithms that are used in production level VMs. There is a huge performance difference between any GC from 1990s and modern generational GC used in production-level VMs.<p>2. Some part of the experiment involved simulation. You must be very careful with extrapolating simulation results onto real world. Actually someone on the Internet rerun one of the same experiment using non-simulated VM and got totally different results, but now I can&#x27;t find that blog post :(<p>3. It compares GC to &quot;ideal&quot; manual memory management, ignoring the fact that manual memory management is not free either. Things like heap fragmentation or computational cost of running allocation/deallocation code do exist and may cause also some real problems. The costs lie elsewhere, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t exist.<p>My experience with large applications is completely different than the conclusion of the paper. Unless you&#x27;re doing something completely crazy like generating several GBs of garbage per second, modern generational GCs overhead is typically very small (<5%) with only 20-50% more memory than the live set size, not 3-5x as the paper claims.<p>The biggest pain not solved completely are pauses, but researchers are actively working on it and things are getting much better.",1399399387

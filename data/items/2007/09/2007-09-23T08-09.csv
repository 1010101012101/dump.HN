58507,comment,58043,58110,0,0,olavk,,,"It is easy to add features to a language. It takes courage to take features away. If you just add every feature than anyone might want, then you end up with something like Perl. Which incidentally seem to be much more popular than Python, so maybe Larry Wall have a point.<p>By ""dumbing down"" I assume you mean ""looks less like lisp"". You can do the same as map and filter in a more elegant and pythonic way using generator expressions.<p>Btw. he was just thinking aloud. In the end he just moved map and filter out of the core language and into a library, and lambda stayed.",1190537404

58501,comment,58429,58467,0,0,Zak,,,"Neither you nor Derek Sivers  has made a case for PHP being the best language for large-scale web apps. In fact, Sivers only makes one argument for PHP: it's ""small and fast"". The rest of his arguments are either against Rails or against switching platforms for part of a production system that still needs to integrate with the old platform.<p>Unsupported blanket statements don't contribute anything useful to the discussion.",1190535254
58500,comment,58429,58429,0,0,Zak,,,"This is yet another article comparing a framework to a language. Aside from #2 and maybe #4, his points would be equally valid comparing Rails to Ruby without a framework. Only #4 is an argument against starting a new project using Ruby, and I think it's a bad one; programmer time is almost always orders of magnitude more valuable than machine time.<p>Edit: I took a look at the site in question. It's simple, fast and mostly well-designed, but the fact that it required 12k LOC and 2 months when he had the best possible functional spec (a working, but internally messy old version) doesn't give me much faith in his abilities or recommendations.",1190534488

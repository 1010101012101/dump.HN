And then you find out exactly why social sciences are progressing so slowly and have such a tough time of getting definite results.<p>I envy everyone working in natural sciences. Their jobs are immensely challenging, no doubt, but at least they have a clear path forward, more or less. But they are making impressive progress all the time.<p>Looking at human behaviour is much more challenging (so challenging that hardly anyone has an idea how to do it and most stick with boring unreliable ways that have somewhat kind of worked in the past), fraught with ethical issues, and so on.<p>Measuring everything is not a realistic goal. Measuring should be done whenever possible and is an awesome tool every designer should be using but it is impossible to employ it for every little change. And it has so far not been possible to develop a general theory of design that would help you decide small things without testing that specific instance of the design.",1392620153

I would argue that the local community, generally has <i>far less power</i> over individuals than their employers and therefore such restrictions are likely to be far less intrusive.<p>For example, if you are a salaried employee and your employer fires you for speech you make on, say, a political cause that goes against your employer&#x27;s interests, that&#x27;s quite possible and if that&#x27;s ok, that is <i>far more threatening</i> IMO to free speech generally than allowing lawsuits in court over defamation.

The over-the-top reaction to what is effectively a caricature in the likes of &#x27;Innocence of Muslims&#x27; is enabled because such treatment of Hinduism by Christians has a history, a history that still plays its part in everyday life of Indians (not just Hindus). Point in case, the article talks about the &#x27;criminalization of homosexuality&#x27;, but fails to mention that it was criminalized by British-raj. Indian judiciary just rejected to get involved into executive branch, a very sensible approach IMHO.<p>The article itself refers to such treatment by naming Edward Said, for example. But then swoops in with personal judgements, calling Rajiv Malhotra&#x27;s essay as a right-wingist parody and trying to link everything with rise of business-friendly nationalist Modi.<p>This is to be expected. Economical rise of any non-western country has historically correlated with doom-and-gloom about it in articles in western media, whether it is liberal or conservative. Even now it is hard for me to read an article about China in The Economist. Just today I saw an article about Chinese government cracking down on sex-racket, and how it is fomenting unrest and civil disobedience among Chinese.",1392619520

On one hand, functioning society, business, and government requires a relatively uninhibited flow of information, and it is particularly dangerous when a government, which monopolizes force, also decides to restrict dialog about issues.<p>But on the other hand, the limits of free speech are ones that must be decided close to those affected.  Brandenburg got off with calling for (and stating he wanted to be a part of!) genocide against African Americans at a KKK rally not because this speech contributed anything to the public discourse worth saving but because the US government had made a series of serious overreaches in prosecuting Communists.  Since one couldn&#x27;t draw a principled line between arguing for eventual genocide and arguing for eventual overthrow of the government, Brandenburg had to be set free.<p>In the end, I think, that communities have a right to make mistakes, and since free speech can&#x27;t be unlimited (handing someone a gun and saying &quot;I hope someone shoots so-and-so&quot; isn&#x27;t protected speech anywhere in the world), the peoples affected get to make this discussion.<p>One thing that bothers me though:  there are a number of fields, like historical linguistics which are malaigned by some in India as colonial (and in fact historical Indo-European linguistics arose from the colonial experience historically) but are argued against as straw men (thinking that the Indo-European hypothesis means Europeans invading India, which it doesn&#x27;t).  I do have a concern that by moving towards a more insular culture in this regard, that it is harder and harder for Indian scholars to make their voices and perspectives heard internationally.

They rely on the dice, negotiate badly (if at all!), buy everything they land on without any master plan in mind, and ignore cash flow until it becomes an issue. These are the opponents most kids will play against in ad hoc games of Monopoly, and in these games, kids will have a grand old time. When the outcome of each dice roll is the most decisive factor in a particular session, a child is at less of a disadvantage.<p>Also, fwiw, 99% of casual players I&#x27;ve seen overvalue the marquee properties like Boardwalk, etc., and undervalue the oranges, light blues, and reds.",1392616982

They are registered as a money services business with FinCEN, but they do not seem to have registered with the states.<p>It&#x27;s possible that they did FinCEN registration first (as that is the easiest and I believe is free, whereas the states require that you have a bond), and state registration is in the works, but I&#x27;ve not seen any evidence of that. I&#x27;d expect that if they were actually in the midst of getting that done, they would be trumpeting that fact widely, as it would be a great way to make themselves stand out from all the illegal-with-no-intent-to-become-legal Bitcoin money transmitters.",1392616960

There are still some pixel junkies left, but these are mostly programmers pretending to be poor designers.<p>> Designers are completely out of the loop after go live, they have done their &#x27;lorem ipsum&#x27; stuff.<p>Only in a failing company that doesn&#x27;t have real designers or doesn&#x27;t know how to manage designers.<p>> Proficiency at UX comes from delivering the deliverables, testing, testing and testing. Listening to the client and the customers. It does not come from a few static designs.<p>So you are saying designers are bad at UX because they don&#x27;t conform to your narrow minded idea of what designers are?",1392616914

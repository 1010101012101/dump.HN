Compared to even two decades ago there are millions upon millions of people who are no longer in poverty. There are countries who have become part of the developed, 1st world. And there are more countries on the way. ""Developing"" isn't just a euphemism for 3rd world shit-hole, a lot of countries are on their way towards the same level of affluence and development as the G8/G20.<p>Certainly there are a lot of problems in the world, some of them unprecedented problems. But there's little cause to bemoan the increasing population of the Earth. Human civilization is becoming more and more capable of dealing with problems like poverty, famine, environmental degradation, and even global climate change, even as it adds more and more members to its family.",1320083959

3178323,comment,3177815,3177815,5,0,steve8918,,,"It really depends on which angle you're coming from, when you mean ""hacker"".<p>Quantitative finance is all math, so in order to really understand it, you need a solid background in probability and statistics.  Even the most basic concepts make heavy use of probability, so without strong fundamentals you won't get very far.<p>There are other concepts, such as risk-free returns, etc that also play a big part in quant finance.  A book that I really enjoyed that gave a good background in a lot of these concepts was ""Trading Strategies for Capital Markets"".<p>One of the basic concepts of quantitative finance revolves around the Black-Scholes equation, which calculates a price for an option.  I would suggest first looking this up as well as how it was derived, to see if you want to pursue this further.  If you're having a hard time with this, then quant finance may not be what you're looking for.<p>A video tutorial website that seems decent for quant finance is Nathan's Lessons:<p><a href=""http://nathanslessons.com/?paged=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanslessons.com/?paged=3</a><p>-------------------<p>If what you REALLY mean is you want to program trading algorithms, that's a bit of a different beast.  For that you really need to understand how algorithmic trading works, how the market microstructure works, how to place trades, etc.  For this there are a bunch of books but the best introductory book is definitely ""Trading and Exchanges: Market Microstructure for Practitioners"".  It's a bit old, but still largely relevant and gives you a lot of the history.  I really wish they would update this book, because I would buy it again.  Another decent book is ""Algorithmic Trading and DMA"".",1320083898

If you are interested in theory, there are plenty of books discussing specific models.

Unless, like me, you have a screw loose :P )<p>If you want some practical discussions, ""Trading and Exchanges"" by Larry Harris is a bit dated, but nothing comes close.  Most of the descriptions are still valid today (even if some of the mechanics have changed)<p>If you want something more along the lines of what a financial engineer would know:<p>- ""Options, Futures, and other Derivatives"" by John Hull (goes over basic models without delving too deeply into theoretical math aspects)<p>- ""Stochastic Calculus for Finance II"" by Steve Shreve (goes over the basic stuff but has enough stats to keep a grad student happy)<p>- ""Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering"" by Paul Glasserman (much more practical, and goes over subtleties of monte carlo simulation and other stuff like low discrepancy sampling)<p>- ""Modelling Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options"" by Robert Jarrow (walks through how to perform certain simulations, covers lots of little details most theoretical books skip)<p>If you want something more theoretical:<p>- ""Introduction to Stochastic Calculus Applied to Finance"" by Lamberton and Lapeyre (Nice little intro)<p>- ""Arbitrage Theory in Continuous Time"" by Tomas Bjork (Slower discussion, larger breadth)<p>- ""Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus"" and ""Methods of Mathematical Finance"" by Karatzas and Shreve (Solid theoretical foundation, for the more mathematically inclined)<p>There was a good non-measure theoretic discussion of financial models but the name escapes me ATM.",1320083717

I realized that time is just one long stretch, and our convention of splitting it up into <i>week</i>s, <i>month</i>s, and <i>year</i>s is just a way to allow us to repeat the same existence over and over again. The day is the only unit that we biologically require, since we have to sleep once per day. We spend five days working, looking forward to those two that we can do what we want, before spending another five working again. We enjoy a given holiday, so we spend a dozen or two days anticipating it, hoping that this <i>year</i>'s installment is just as enjoyable.<p>At the time I had the ""insight"", it was incredibly sad to me. I felt like we have a beautiful stretch of time laying out in front of us, and instead of enjoying every unique moment, we entangle it with spirals and walk through similar lives, <i>week</i> after <i>week</i>, <i>month</i> after <i>month</i>, <i>year</i> after <i>year</i>.",1320083564

The bigger problem, and one that has nothing whatsoever to do with Twitter exposing this information, is the morally bankrupt turds at Klout asserting that I am using their service <i>when I am not</i>. They have plausible deniability, in the sense that ""on"" can refer to their harebrained 'analysis' of my timeline, but it's obvious that that's not their intended meaning.<p>EDIT: There's an argument that Klout is possibly violating Twitter's Terms of Service, too:<p><i>C. Your Service should not:<p>...<p>impersonate or facilitate impersonation of others in a manner that can mislead, confuse, or deceive users.</i><p>I'm pretty sure that ""look, this person you know is 'on' Klout!"" when I have and desire no relationship with their service would fall under this category (or would if Twitter actually enforced such rules, which it doesn't appear they do).

Or the pinnacle of my joy in programming, which, of course, is difficult to distinguish.  :-)<p>I spent hours upon hours poring over VGA graphics code in Pascal, then assembly (called by Pascal, since I wasn't sophisticated enough to understand how to build a stand-alone EXE from ASM) in high school.  I would tweak things, then run against the slick built-in profiler, then refine some more.  Some time later, I came across this vast information pipe called Usenet and found out that everything I worked on was years out of date, since ModeX provided dramatically faster access to video memory.

In every deed, pestilence and famine and wars have to be regarded as a remedy for nations as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the human race.""<p>-Tertullian (a Carthaginian priest in 210 AD when the world population was 250 million)<p>Can we improve the ways in which we utilize the resources on our plant?

Gimme a break dude.<p>Considering the vast difference between Windows and OS X APIs; it's quite clear why mal-programmers don't waste their time with OS X. You would have to spend MORE than half your time attacking the Mac for less than 10% of your total attack surface.<p>The only other argument that has been made in the face of this fact is from Gruber who said: If Macs have 10% of the market, why don't they have 10% of the viruses? That's like saying because I am Nth the size of the sun, I should have Nth the power of the sun. Reality does not work that way. Everything does not have to be proportional and in this case it's crystal clear why it is not proportional.<p>Would you please kindly concede this point now?",1320080577

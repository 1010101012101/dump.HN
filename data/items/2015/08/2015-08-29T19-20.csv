It is classic AI marketing.<p>From what I can tell their &#x27;AI&#x27; chooses colors, and fonts and does some basic layout. All three bits can be done very simply. So you choose a template, it stores a few basic qualities, then uses those qualities later to choose how to parameterise its tools for adding new content to your site.<p>It&#x27;s not strong AI, you might want to claim it isn&#x27;t AI at all. But even backtracking best-first search qualifies as 80s-era symbolic AI. I don&#x27;t think you need to have an undergrad CompSci to do that. My AI textbook is used by plenty of non-graduates, I certainly hope it contains enough to implement those kinds of tools without my readers needing advanced degrees or research credentials!<p>So I found the article overly cynical: I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re claiming it will translate your human language into a site. I didn&#x27;t get that claim, at least. I interpreted it as them using the inherent magicness of &#x27;artificial intelligence&#x27; as a marketing term, confusing together things that their tool will do, with things that the AI code will do.<p>Overhyped product which is a big UX investment masquerading as technical IP? Definitely! A scam with no intent to deliver? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>My first reaction seeing the video a few months ago was &#x27;clever&#x27;. Not &#x27;clever&#x27; as in &#x27;clever AI or tech&#x27;, but &#x27;a neat use of very simple AI tools with a UX focus to make blogging / portfolio software a bit more flexible.&#x27;<p>[edit: add last para]",1440878135

It sends out a pulse, it listens for the response.  It doesn&#x27;t know that your WiFi traffic isn&#x27;t a return signal from a raindrop.  And it has to be quite sensitive, because raindrops are small and are not exactly purpose-built radio reflectors.<p>The previous approach to monitoring for wind shear conditions was to have a surface station at the airport, and hope that the conditions at the surface station were the same along the entire final approach corridor.  Sometimes this was true.  Sometimes it wasn&#x27;t and people died.  Aviation is a lot safer these days, even though we fly many more planes in the same airspace.  Even an imperfect technology adds to the safety calculus.<p>Giving that safety and capacity up so you can use a shitty low-power low-bandwidth frequency in the 5GHz wifi band is not appealing to me.  (There are plenty of full-power, 80MHz-wide frequencies that are WiFi-only.  Use those!)<p>The FCC should have never allowed sharing to begin with.

I read somewhere, maybe in Peopleware, that in a lighting study, they found any change (brighter, darker) to a workplace imported productivity. The idea being that it was just the change, not really mattering what was changed.<p>Perhaps it reflects poorly on me, but I love novelty. Different places, new software, new languages (or improved features) - it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ll get a huge boost working on a shitty desk in a cold hotel, for a week. I started learning Ruby, and while I find it revolting in a way (it&#x27;s like the opposite of elegance), I&#x27;m enjoying learning it.<p>This must be a well known effect, as MS seems to make small but very noticeable cosmetic changes to their UIs. I feel ... something when using the older version. Something slightly beneath my conscious perception, something that changes and feels fresh when I upgrade. (Similar but not quite the same thing when I use a shitty cross platform UI that doesn&#x27;t get things quite right.)<p>I should probably collect a few good fonts and color schemes and rotate them automatically.<p>And you know, it doesn&#x27;t really matter when working.

You can get everything aligned for the font you&#x27;re using, and the tab width you&#x27;ve specified in your editor, but when someone else views the code in a different proportional font or a different tab width - or in a monospaced font! - they will likely see &quot;off by a tab&quot; errors.<p>Proportional fonts do work fine with tab-based <i>indentation</i>. If you stop using column alignment, as I did many years ago, then it no longer matters whether you use proportional or monospaced fonts, and it doesn&#x27;t even matter whether you use tabs or spaces for indentation. All sorts of code fomatting questions just become non-issues.<p>And column alignment was always such a hassle, I was glad to give it up anyway.

Here is the Wikipedia page on that concept with several citations: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adequate_and_independent_state_ground"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adequate_and_independent_state...</a><p>For other federal courts, one relevant concept is &quot;federal question jurisdiction.&quot; (So called, because raising a &quot;federal question,&quot; is synonymous with presenting a case that arises under the &quot;laws of the United States.&quot;) Here is a classic case on that issue (though it is much more complex than necessary to prove the present point.) Tennessee v. Union and Planters&#x27; Bank, <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/152/454/case.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/152/454/case.htm...</a><p>Here is a relevant quote (though if you really want to learn how this all works, I recommend reading the entire case carefully):<p>> &quot;We find it unnecessary to consider other objections to the maintenance of these three bills, or of any of them, because we are clearly of opinion that each suit is not one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, of which the circuit court of the United States has jurisdiction, either original, or by removal from a state court, under the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, as corrected by the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866. 25 Stat. 434.&quot;<p>And here is a more quotidian example: Lake v. Malone, No. CA 3:11-824-CMC-PJG, 2011 WL 2162711, at 2 (D.S.C. May 6, 2011) report and recommendation adopted, No. CA 3:11-824-CMC-PJG, 2011 WL 2162159 (D.S.C. June 1, 2011)<p>> “This case is subject to summary dismissal because the allegations contained in Plaintiff&#x27;s Complaint do not fall within the scope of either form of this court&#x27;s limited jurisdiction, and there is no other possible basis for federal jurisdiction evident from the face of the pleading. There is no viable federal question alleged and there is no apparent diversity of citizenship between the plaintiff and the defendants.<p>> Generally, a case can be originally filed in a federal district court if there is “federal question” jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 or “diversity of citizenship” under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, “constrained to exercise only the authority conferred by Article III of the Constitution and affirmatively granted by federal statute.” In re Bulldog Trucking, Inc., 147 F.3d 347, 352 (4th Cir.1998). Since federal courts have limited subject matter jurisdiction, there is no presumption that the court has jurisdiction. Pinkley, Inc. v. City of Frederick, 191 F.3d 394, 399 (4th Cir.1999) (citing Lehigh Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Kelly, 160 U.S. 337 (1895). Accordingly, a federal court is required, sua sponte, to determine if a valid basis for its jurisdiction exists, “and to dismiss the action if no such ground appears.” Bulldog Trucking, 147 F.3d at 352; see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) (“Whenever it appears ... that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.”). “[T]he facts providing the court jurisdiction must be affirmatively alleged in the complaint.” Davis v. Pak, 856 F.2d 648, 650 (4th Cir.1988) (citing McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 56 S.Ct. 780, 80 L.Ed. 1135 (1936)). To this end, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) (1)requires that the complaint provide “a short plain statement of the grounds upon which the court&#x27;s jurisdiction depends[.]” If, however, the complaint does not contain “an affirmative pleading of a jurisdictional basis, the federal court may find that it has jurisdiction if the facts supporting jurisdiction have been clearly pleaded.” Pinkley, Inc., 191 F.3d at 399 (citing 2 Moore&#x27;s Federal Practice § 8.03[3] (3d ed.1997)). Although the absence of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time during the case, determining jurisdiction at the outset of the litigation is the most efficient procedure. Lovern v. Edwards, 190 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir.1999). If the court, viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, finds insufficient allegations in the pleadings, the court will lack subject matter jurisdiction. Id.”<p>By the way, you&#x27;re right in one small, interesting respect: &quot;laws of the United States&quot; does not <i>just</i> refer to the U.S. Code. It also refers to federal regulations, federal common law, state-law claims bound up in the same dispute as a federal-law claim where the state-law issues do not predominate, and the very rare state law issue that raises significant federal interests. As you can see, lawyers and judges have given this phrase a lot of thought over the years. And don&#x27;t forget that Art III <i>does</i> also allow cases under state law to be brought in federal courts when the litigants are from different states. But you remain quite wrong that Art III, and the term &quot;laws of the United States,&quot; refers to <i>all</i> laws in the United States, whether state of federal, as the two cases above clearly demonstrate.

In practice, the quality of thought processes seems much more important than the the rate at which such processes are carried out.<p>For example, attempting to assess &quot;cognitive speed&quot; can be very dangerous in interviews. It seems like such a promising metric. A candidate who answers questions 10% faster than average will generally be much more impressive than a candidate who answers questions 10% slower than average, and it&#x27;s tempting to think person A will be 22% more productive. Of course, over time, it may turn out that he occasionally provides more <i>bad</i> solutions to problems, or can only solve superficial problems, or solves the wrong problems. And you realize the person who consistently solves problems correctly (albeit at a slower pace) is a better choice than the person who introduces new problems as quickly as he solves existing problems.<p>It could always be argued that person B is actually thinking faster, but thinking through the problem much more carefully, causing him to verbalize his answer later. Or perhaps both people are thinking at the same speed, but person B has simply thought <i>more</i>. Maybe person B is actually thinking slower but more effectively. From an outsider&#x27;s perspective, we can&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening under the hood, which makes &quot;cognitive speed&quot; a weak metric for judging effectiveness in practice.",1440877148

That&#x27;s possible, and one is allowed to complain. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s in bad taste to frame it that way.

Sometimes the 10m band is essentially unusable because of interference from CB users.<p>The end result is very similar to the WiFi situation, they ruined it for everyone.  Now it&#x27;s difficult for licensed amateur radio operators to buy amplifiers for use with low-power transceivers.  The FCC has rules about what the minimum power input to amplifiers can be, and require manufacturers to go to great lengths to prevent the amplifier from working on CB frequencies.  This reduces performance and reliability, and increases expense, all to prevent something no licensed amateur would do.<p>That said, the FCC has only a minimal enforcement budget, so there are plenty of illegal CB amplifiers readily available on eBay.  The rules only hurt legitimate American companies and users of licensed radio services.",1440874807

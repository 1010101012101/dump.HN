It doesn't make sense all the time since you might just waste a lot of time but it makes a lot of sense if it will cause you to grow.<p>Good tip!",1210222694

Also, I use google to search rentacoder.com bio pages and find someone who has already successfully done as close as possible to what I'm looking for, but for a different client.

Typically, they like articles to be short because the conventional wisdom is that people reading blogs have a 700-word attention span. (I tend to disagree with this wisdom, and even if it's true, I have little to say to people who can only comprehend 700 words at a time.) I was already pushing it at 1,100 words, and I had absolutely had to cut it down from 1,500.<p>Fortunately, if you do want something longer, there's always that 156,083-word essay you mentioned...",1210221981

If the latter you might consider whether your business can flourish under a GPL license with the option of a community interest to improve the software.<p>My immediate suggestion would be to get the code checked into a private repository, hosted at github or elsewhere. Then with a high volume laser printer on hand, get into a routine where you print out your code base on a weekly basis.<p>At that point its just a matter of hiring some folks to take a look at what you have, as far as the code base goes, before deciding who to pay next to advance the project.",1210221812

184205,comment,183846,183846,0,0,breck,,,"I wonder if it's because our generation rarely pays for software (since we've grown up in a culture with Napster, Gnutella, and BitTorrent). We expect to get every type of software for free. So the thought of developing software you charge for is foreign to us, even though that's where the majority of revenue in the industry comes from.",1210221529

I actually am visiting Boston right now, and lived here for about three years before moving to SF.  \nBoston/Cambridge area is great if you are going to school, as they are tons of students around, but after school is done, it becomes boring really fast, and winters are miserable.<p>There are lots of smart people around in here, but you are more likeley to meet the guy with the businness idea that just needs a developer, or the guy that worked for years, and has enough capital and connections to hire a bunch of code monkeys to implement stuff,  than smart hackers getting together to do something.  A lot of tech jobs around here are boring,  (financial companies, enterprise stuff), and if you are young, it will be a great handicap on how VCs will treat you.<p>Boston is just too conservative to be fun.",1210219285

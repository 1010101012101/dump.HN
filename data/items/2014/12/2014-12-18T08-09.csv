And I have exactly the opposite reaction about warfare.  I think that the terror of proper war is on an entirely different level, in most ways worse, in fewer ways not as bad.  Someone being attacked in a war can&#x27;t give in to a political threat and make the danger go away.  It&#x27;s entirely different. A state can perform terrorism but it&#x27;s not by dropping bombs on every city they can reach.<p>Civilians in a time of war aren&#x27;t exactly targets but they&#x27;re not 100% innocent either.  It&#x27;s complicated.  Children don&#x27;t make choices but they are affected by the choices of their guardians.  It would be nice to say that any civilian casualties in war are unacceptable but that&#x27;s clearly not how humans work.",1418893069

It&#x27;s also been positively affected from more CPUs, RAM, and the general computer speed advances in recent years. The ecosystem has also stabilized (jSite, SONE, etc. as mentioned in the article). I personally like what has happened in the Freenet user interface and the ability to choose between levels of connection security/trust over speed (read about that on the site).",1418892743

8766526,comment,8765836,8766460,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"I think the parent is suggesting that a fact based criticism of China is difficult to perform in China.<p>This claim is actually a much more complicated one than the parent suggests. While it is true that a number of search terms are going to raise eyebrows in China (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_blacklisted_keywords_in_China"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_blacklisted_keywords_i...</a>) the &#x27;blacklisting&#x27; is a much more complicated algorithm than post-and-you-are-disappeared - for the most part there are filters for how large an audience certain messages can reach although on some platforms &#x27;errors&#x27; will prevent certain words from being posted. (Anecdotally, I have encountered such &#x27;errors&#x27; in America on Facebook while posting news about Occupy, leaked Trans Pacific Partnership documents, Snowden Documents, Wikileaks links, Manning documents and others. Facebook assures me that it&#x27;s the spam filter - this never made logical sense to me but alas a tangent). Another complication is that much of the blocked content in China <i>is</i> foreign propaganda - if you look at the dissident news section of the Wiki article and follow up on them you will see that they are not grassroots news organizations but set up by Western states and notably America. This is a well known favorite tactic of the United States (see the use of militarized media in the invasion of Iraq, the Lincohn group infiltrations, Radio Free Iraq, Voice of America, the compelled press released by Iraqi bloggers detained while passing American checkpoints, etc - or look at the Cuban Twitter effort to overthrow Cuba this year - or look at the DARPA programs to use Twitter to &#x27;deradicalize the Middle East&#x27;, where they go so far as to use brain scans of people reading Twitter messages to predict which propaganda items will have the most positive US political impacts in Jordan, Egypt, Syria and others). A further complication is that America is under some of the same propagandizing efforts today and has asked a number of ways for authorization to interfere (it is not really known what is currently done without explicit authorization to combat these messages). Also, as mentioned in the &#x27;sister comment&#x27;, highly critical commentary is regularly and freely posted about the Chinese government. This is confirmed by both speaking with Chinese citizens and by Western studies of Chinese media.<p>Finally, I encounter this criticism fairly often. I actually agree in moderate doses with it. There are certainly states which a person would not get away with any sort of criticism of the government and there are states where all records of history are destroyed and rewritten as favored by whichever administration (both historically and today) - I do think to the degree that the United States allows most select information to become public and to the degree that the United States minimally alters records it should be commended.<p>Yet these freedoms are not worth anything if they are not practiced - it is important not to buy into the myths of our nation (well, my nation, I don&#x27;t know where the reader resides) and to demand ever more of it and of ourselves.<p>And we must be careful here of the comparison - we do not want to suggest that the United States is somehow in every way more free than China. China is landing very softly into a modern Republican Capitalism, it&#x27;s civil rights have been steadily increasing, and the China censorship bit is drastically overemphasized. As a last thought, the point the parent makes is tangential to the discussion at large, which is about Fourth Estate and penal system.",1418892719

2 - The patent and other legal grants in the licence won&#x27;t apply if we try to reverse engineer a compatible GPL2 equivalent for the kernel to use, which will be a HUGE risk for the few companies that would probably consider the cost of reverse engineering worth it.

We&#x27;ve been led to believe that they exist in a technological dark ages of sorts, with most of their infrastructure relying on technology that would horrify the average HN user. They&#x27;re certainly belligerent enough, but now suddenly we find that they have not just the technology to pull it off, but also the talent? How does that kind of talent even develop under a strictly regimented government like North Korea&#x27;s? What kind of ability do they actually have?<p>See, this really isn&#x27;t the case, and why most people believe this is beyond me, when a google search would suffice. I&#x27;m not criticizing you, actually, just pointing out that there&#x27;s an incredible amount of misinformation out there about North Korea. Look at these photographs of a technology trade fair in Pyongyang this summer, for example:<p><a href=""http://www.northkoreatech.org/2014/06/23/another-look-at-the-spring-trade-fair/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.northkoreatech.org/2014/06/23/another-look-at-the...</a><p>Most telling, IMO, is that a 32G usb is being sold for USD20, where at the time of writing, the same product was nearly USD16 on Amazon US. That&#x27;s a remarkably low markup for a product, especially for one in North Korea. Also considering that it&#x27;s a high volume, low price product with so little of a markup makes me think that other technologies must be very available and accessible, and that NK is hardly the technological dark ages that popular discussion has us think it is.<p>Of course, this all isn&#x27;t to say that NK performed the hack, but I hardly think that a lack of infrastructure would really be the barrier if North Korea really wanted to train a cadre of hackers.",1418890590

I&#x27;m not talking about a level of concern that causes people to modify their behavior around media consumption, I&#x27;m talking about the level of terror that breaks your enemy&#x27;s will to fight.  Again, terrorism falls within the spectrum of warfare - not criminal behavior.  I&#x27;d argue that the identity and reputation of the aggressor needs to be established for a bomb threat to be considered terroristic.  Even the CIA, an entity that would benefit from a loose definition of terrorist, refuses to classify a group as &quot;terrorist&quot; unless they have expressed intent <i>and</i> demonstrated capability.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t make any sense to exempt states from the list of potential terrorist actors - because the state invented terrorism.  As I said, spectrum of warfare.  Now intelligent people can disagree about the ability of individuals to declare war... but then terrorism is restricted to the state.  I hope you&#x27;ve misunderstood my WWII example, because otherwise you&#x27;ve just argued that civilian children, elderly and infirm were somehow not bystanders while huddled in bomb shelters.  My history isn&#x27;t super strong, but I don&#x27;t think anybody has ever argued that the British engaged in total war - which would be necessary for children to be classified as anything but bystanders.",1418890129

The Korean locale/encoding is very easily changed as a setting, obviously, but it&#x27;s also possibly used by NK hackers because it would let North Koreans type in Korean. Saying &quot;North Koreans don&#x27;t speak the same kind of Korean as spoke in South Korea, and thus wouldn&#x27;t have a Korean locale set&quot; is kind of like saying &quot;Americans have their own dialect of English as distinct from the British, so they probably will not have any English-language keyboards.&quot;<p>#4.

I checked the author bylines, because Judith Miller and the NYTimes, and David E Sanger I could see being politically motivated to make a case like that on some pretty flimsy evidence, but Nicole Perlroth has good tech journalist creds.<p>So, I dunno. Looks like it might be North Korea after all.<p>At the moment, I figure there are three scenarios, and none of them are really wonderful to think about:<p>1. It&#x27;s China, working through or with North Korea. They certainly have the ability (and in some cases, insider information), and they&#x27;ve been waging a network and technology-based conflict around the world for years now. But, in the past, they&#x27;ve been carefully diplomatic about managing relations between North Korea and the rest of the world; it doesn&#x27;t make sense for them to suddenly paint a huge target on NK&#x27;s back, and China&#x27;s past exploits have been kept pretty quiet. I don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;d want this one to be big and public.<p>2. It actually is North Korea. We&#x27;ve been led to believe that they exist in a technological dark ages of sorts, with most of their infrastructure relying on technology that would horrify the average HN user. They&#x27;re certainly belligerent enough, but now suddenly we find that they have not just the technology to pull it off, but also the talent? How does that kind of talent even develop under a strictly regimented government like North Korea&#x27;s? What kind of ability do they actually have?<p>3. It&#x27;s neither North Korea nor China. This is the most disturbing one to think about; now that the NYTimes and Washington are involved, it smells a bit like the kind of political maneuver with propaganda that we saw in the run-up to the Iraq war. At the moment, this is still really feasible, and it makes me wonder what Washington&#x27;s motives might be.<p>Only time will tell for sure, I guess.

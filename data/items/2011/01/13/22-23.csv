2101709,comment,2096619,2098026,0,0,Udo,,,"> <i>You're neglecting many reasons extra terrestrial life may pose a threat.</i><p>I'm ignoring the ones that are so far in the realm of speculation with today's knowledge they could go either way. For example the argument ""they may want to live here"" could be valid, but there is just as much reason to believe that any space-faring civilization bent on aggressive expansion should already have significant terraforming capabilities, thereby making uninhabited worlds an easier target. The second issue with this particular argument is the probability that Earth would be a perfect environment for a given alien species: We simply don't know how many earth-like planets are out there. If there are many, the probability of compatibility would be high, but so would the number of less-problematic alternative planets to choose from. If there are few, chances are our world needs to be terraformed anyway in order to make it habitable, meaning there is no reason to choose it for colonization over many other (uninhabited) candidate planets in the first place.<p>> <i>wiping out humanity probably won't be particularly challenging for them</i><p>Nobody said it would be.<p>> <i>Also, your second point is invalid, territorial reasons are not void. We may pose no threat now, however a technologically superior civilization may conclude we pose a future threat, and so wipe us out now before we can become one.</i><p>That's a misunderstanding. I did categorize reasons like this one as spiritual or ""other"", because it's not rooted in a concrete need to eliminate us right away. Never mind the categorization: yes, that's a possibility I tried to hint at with the paragraph ""<i>There are still some nefarious reasons why an outside civilization may attack us [...] There are certainly other reasons we can't even think of yet.</i>""<p>> <i>Also, the old 'dangerous biology from somewhere else!' is almost entirely null and void, organisms are adapted to their environment, they usually pose negligible risk to any other environment already inhabited by biological organisms. This is why, for instance we don't treat organisms from thermal vents as 'oh noes, biohazard material'.</i><p>I really dislike your polemic style, so let me answer in kind: the caretakers of countless pacific islands and other isolated places who are currently struggling to protect habitats from invasions of foreign species would probably like to subscribe to your newsletter. Little did they know how unfounded their concerns had been until you came along.",1294959522

A study they are careful not to elaborate upon in this press release. I worked for StarCom 1997-2000 in their new & shiny online advertising group. StarCom is heavily incented to produce research proving the effectiveness of all types of advertising. And they own a much larger share of online display advertising than they do of paid search engine marketing. I can't prove that their current research is biased. But when I worked there, we were quite careful to present our results in the best possible light. For example, we ran a very large banner ad campaign for a Proctor & Gamble product. There were two reasonable ways to determine if it was effective: Ask an online panel if the recalled seeing the banner ads in question. Or look at the actual grocery store / drug store sales data to see if the banner campaign caused any lift in sales. The first argued that the millions spent on this campaign produced OK brand awareness; the second demonstrated that it did nothing to move the product.

This person has been 'worn down' and is probably not going to be very helpful to your customers at all.    It's a common thing;  customer service is a hard job.  It pays poorly and offers few opportunities for advancement.   If you keep customers who can't be helped around, your customer service people often spend the majority of their time on people who can not be helped, something that would be incredibly frustrating even if the job paid okay and had reasonable opportunities for advancement.<p>Secondarily, even if the person still feels like you gave them poor service, the 'at least I got a refund' quite often mollifies them to the point of not complaining (or at least complaining less) in public.  I mean, I don't want to let myself be held hostage by public complaints;  some people will complain no matter what you do.  But, I think that a refund when a customer is unsatisfied is quite often the easiest, most polite, and in the end, cheapest way to fire a customer who needs firing.",1294957183

I'd never have experienced the beauty and creativity of crafting a piece of software<p>Xcode is free to download and use (you have to pay $99 to deploy your app but not to develop it). I have been learning Objective C for the past month, and I fail to see how is it that I am not experiencing ""the beauty and creativity of crafting a piece of software.""<p>Try it. I have used Visual Studio back in the day (before .NET, so I can't compare to today's Visual Studio), but Cocoa made me understand design patterns such as MVC and Delegate with much less pain and with much more pleasure than I would have had in some other framework that does not rely on them to such an extent.<p>I have been a tinkerer myself. I have been lucky enough to have my own little chemistry lab at my house when I was 10. I used Linux since 2003, and my daily living depends on it even now (at work I program software that runs on Linux servers). I understand where you're coming from. But I have also understood the other point of view, namely that the computer is just a tool, and not an end goal in itself, and as a tool it should just work, even if it means making some concessions to users who don't care about tinkering.<p>Just because you tinkered with electronic components, and today's hardware is more integrated, preventing you from doing that, doesn't mean that there isn't something else to tinker with. Also, you can still tinker with the iPhone -- as a photographer it made incredibly happy to find out that somebody had written a lightmeter app for the iPhone which uses the built-in camera to measure the available light so you could then enter those settings to fire up a manual film SLR from the 1970s. Just because today's tinkering is different from yesterdays doesn't mean it disappeared (or that yesterday's tinkerers are somehow inherently superior to today's).",1294957071

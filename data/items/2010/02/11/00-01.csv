You can't get away with abusive behavior towards employees and vendors and expect to keep the good ones around - anyone that's worth the money has far too many options to put up with cheapskate asshats like this.  If you treat everyone like shit, don't act surprised when only shitty people continue to work with you.<p>When a client starts dicking around with payments for work already provided and doesn't have a really good reason (yes, occasionally things happen and it's okay to be a little flexible if you're convinced it's on the level), my rate for future work doubles, and if that means that projects go elsewhere, so be it.  Fighting over payments is possibly the most unpleasant aspect of providing services to companies, and I'd generally rather pass up the work than get into those fights.<p>Don't follow this guy's example - you're not important enough to afford to be this abusive, and frankly, neither is he.",1265849094

I don't think it was very successful. They pulled some of the campaign types associated with these things.<p>It was a sort of automated system for specifying what you would like to pay per conversion and Google guaranteeing that you won't be charged any more for it.. I thin Given your conversion rate performance, it could give you some ppc bid for the system to work with. Then it could ""optimise"" your system to get you as many conversions as possible at the price you specified.<p>I think the problem was that they had to offer it to customers who were fairly sophisticated already. In the back-end it was really just converting it all back to pay per click anyway (I think). These advertisers were in control of their costs per conversion anyway. All the system really did was (potentially) save them time. But, you lose some flexibility which I think made it not worth much. I found that it performed less well then I could do myself.<p>Now they offer automated bid management, which really does something fairly similar, it automates your campaign for conversions.<p>What they cannot do under their system is offer you X conversions @ Y cost.",1265848838

The obvious candidates are purely asshole comments, trolling comments, intentionally racist comments, etc., and there are less obvious ones too. (Almost any joke where the author feels a need to reply, &quot;guess no one around here has a sense of humor&quot; after being downvoted probably fits.)<p>The discussion is better if those comments are lower on the page and, ideally, discouraged from being made at all. Downvoting does both.<p>> Then all you have is upvoting, which is based purely on merit. It sounds like people don&#x27;t like the idea of forum meritocracy, though.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what this means or what a &quot;meritocracy&quot; is in this setting. (The moderators are in charge; the highest ranked users will never form a ruling class or be in power. Most forums are not &quot;meritocracies&quot;, &quot;socialist exeriments&quot;, &quot;democracies&quot;, &quot;plutocracies&quot;, &quot;oligarchies&quot;, &quot;monopolies&quot;, or anything that implies something other than a loosely managed commenting system.)<p>HN has many readers that know an absolute shitload about different subjects, and I&#x27;d like them to share interesting information and anecdotes about interesting articles. I don&#x27;t want to read stupid jokes and memes on HN, because there are other places that are better for that.

Debt looks scary, but when other countries owe the US trillions too, it balances out somewhat. The net international investment position is an aggregate measure of how much over-leveraged the country is as a whole, and looks much less stark. This combines government debt with citizen assets, which is good and bad - masks federal policy issues, but also accounts for the artificially low taxes in the US and the impact that has on relative wealth placement.",1415678308

It was most definitely NOT OK for Britain to displace Chagossians the way they did, because adequate compensation did not occur. I think I made this very clear in the parent comment.<p>But Returning Chagos to the Chagossians now will not fix any of the million things that went wrong. We have plenty of nominally independent but barely subsisting island nations in this world, we seriously don&#x27;t need another. What is needed is a concrete plan to get the Chagossians (and their descendents) out of those Mauritian slums in which Britain so carelessly dumped them 50 years ago. Returning them to Chagos might or might not be a part of this plan, but if they insist on it at the expense of more urgent material needs, so much the worse for them.<p>&quot;What&#x27;s done is done,&quot; but we can do more. For example: British passports, British pensions, British health care, British education for their children, a formal apology, and fair political representation. Keep adding to the list until their children can honestly say they&#x27;re glad that their parents left their former home. That would count as adequate compensation.",1415677941

I do prefer this approach for headlines or animated effects, but perhaps (as was suggested elsewhere) changing the underline colour and/or tightening the spacing would help. A neat implementation though. Seeing links here, it&#x27;s true, the &quot;g&quot;s just seem to get demolished by the underline.

It uses the dpkt library for packet encap and decap, as well as dnet and pypcap for capturing and transmission. It&#x27;s probably not as fancy as WireEdit, but then again the intended audience is different. I started writing Hexcap, in ESR&#x27;s terms, to scratch my own itch.<p>I&#x27;m a grad student which means Hexcap goes for long periods without updates. But when breaks roll around I usually find time to hack on it. If this kind of thing interests you, I&#x27;d be interested in hearing about your opinion of Hexcap.

Would someone inevitably ask him for a favour? <i>&quot;Could you have your peon mow my lawn? -I&#x27;ll buy you a beer some time!&quot;</i><p>Would the ruler want more subjects? -Of course! It just means more benefits for him, more opportunities for making money at his subjects&#x27; expense! The possibilities are limitless!<p>Now take a bunch of rulers with 320 million subjects. Would Comcast ask them to make it difficult to compete with them? Competition is bothersome you know. It forces you to provide better quality at lower prices, even though you&#x27;d much rather just fleece a captive audience!<p>&quot;Corruption&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. It sounds like something is wrong, but actually it&#x27;s just an element of a system with rulers and subjects working as intended.<p>> There&#x27;s no shortage of stories of homeowners or landlords with videos of vandals and robbers only to be told to piss off. The police don&#x27;t want to mess with the gangs unless they have to or it looks bad if there are too many minority arrests that month.<p>You&#x27;re seeing another aspect of the system working as intended.<p>If you&#x27;re a ruler, do you <i>really</i> care about your subjects&#x27; well-being? -Of course not. You&#x27;ll <i>pretend</i> you do because you need them to refrain from overthrowing you, but your subjects are just <i>tools</i> to you.<p>Your &quot;Royal Guard&quot; (=the police) are meant to protect your power and to enforce your edicts, not to help your subjects.

As good a job as you&#x27;re doing, YC <i>is</i> the sponsor of HN and just because of that there will always be this perception.

Those lines were drawn long before you showed up and within those lines you&#x27;re doing the best you can.<p>FWIW I too recall several instances of users that were banned imho unjustly as well as some threads where the pro-YC bias broke through but over the vast amount of content generated here those are very very few instances, not by far enough to claim systematic bias or to be used as evidence for some nefarious plot.

I frequently visit mail.google.com, and I trust that I&#x27;m not getting phished. I&#x27;m going purely on the basis of the URL there. I wouldn&#x27;t feel the same way going to, say, mail.google.me.<p>In order to trust a URL, you must be sure that your client system isn&#x27;t compromised (and nothing in between). If it is, you&#x27;re vulnerable to much worse than phishing. Phishing is likely unnecessary at that point.<p>It has nothing to do with the URL being secure or insecure. Using web-enabled computers on a daily basis means that we&#x27;re trusting our systems not to be infected by unknown/undetected malware.

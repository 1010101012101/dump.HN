3354517,comment,3353618,3354346,15,0,UrbanPat,,,"I live in Birmingham, so I need to correct a couple things. First, the ""illegal"" tax has been around a long time. In this particular case, it was overturned on a technicality [1]. However, because the state government is hostile to Birmingham, it has been impossible to replace the lost revenue. However, that's relatively unimportant, because the sewer budget is separate, and funded only by sewer system revenues.<p>Secondly, the construction problems, common among massive public projects, really weren't the problem. The problem is that County Commissioners were BRIBED by bankers into taking out unwise interest rate swaps in 2003. I believe all five commissioners from that period have been convicted of corruption, particularly Larry Langford, commission president. [2]<p>The reason for the bankruptcy is less that interest rates rose, but primarily the freezing of the market for municipal bonds during the 2008-2009 recession. Bloomberg explains, ""After some bond insurers incurred losses on subprime- related securities, threatening the credit ratings they used to guarantee other Jefferson debts, investors in 2008 dumped the sewer securities on banks that had agreed to act as buyers of last resort. That triggered contractual requirements for the county to pay off $850 million of the debt in four years instead of the 30 or 40 under the original agreements, according to government records."" [3]<p>So it is clear that BOTH bankers and our local politicians are at fault for this problem. Both acted illegally. Our politicians are in jail, but the guilty bankers are not. So, yes, I think JP Morgan should pay a substantial penalty for this.<p>1: <a href=""http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/03/alabama_supreme_court_rules_je.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/03/alabama_supreme_court_ru...</a>

Passing a bill in the House does not require it to be palatable to the other party, the Senate, or the President, nor is it required for it to have any realistic hope of ever becoming law.<p>I didn't really mean for this to be an unpleasantly partisan post, just a statement of facts about the situation in Washington as I see it. The current Democrats in power have many flaws, but I see no reason to think their goal is to avoid action, because a lack of action would provide no benefit to them.<p>To argue that the House has genuinely tried to get things done during this session, I would think you would have to assent to one of the following two things:<p>1. Even with a divided Congress, it is not required for both parties to work together in a bipartisan spirit of compromise to pass meaningful legislation.<p>2.

I certainly agree that you can and should get help, but I also think that there are cases when the ""suicide is selfish"" people are the selfish ones.

At some point you manage to carry on despite all the bad feelings, and you're simply dragging yourself through the last bit of crap that's holding you back. I recognise that my patience is limited, so I've set myself a goal that I can attain before it runs out (getting out of here and back to a sunny country).<p>It's frustrating to know that many people said, while I was going through the worst of it, that going back to Australia, back home, would be running away from my problems. One thing I learnt during it all was that everyone gives different advice. You're so vulerable, and no matter what people say, you often follow it. It took me at least one year, if not two, to not take advice too seriously, except that which I gave myself. It's nice to get some control back, even though the things I can't control (my thoughts and feelings) still make life difficult.
It's been good to just vent a little even if it's to strangers and in public, though mostly anonymous.<p>What I find difficult is that I don't really know many people that are willing to simply listen.<p>Mostly people brush off how you are feeling with ""everything heals with time"", but all you need is ""yes, you're feeling absolutely rotten right now. I understand."" It's the people that really can relate that stop ignoring you're current situation, as if it didn't matter because something better will be there eventually.<p>So much more to vent, but I'll save it for someone else :)<p>Home stretch.

3354506,comment,3350208,3351420,1,0,chc,,,"It's part of the language's overriding design philosophy of pervasive OO. As much of the language as possible is implemented in terms of objects and methods, including seemingly syntactic things like ""private"", ""attr_accessor"", the top-level scope and all member access to other objects. It's all objects and methods under the hood, but you shouldn't have to think about it in those terms. You're not supposed to be concerned with how the accessor for an object's name is implemented  you're just supposed to feel like you're accessing it.<p>Other languages have been moving in this direction, too. Objective-C has dot notation, C# lets you define getters and setters, Python has the @property decorator, Scala has special ""magic"" methods and quirky syntax rules to make this work, etc. All of these serve the same purpose as Ruby's optional parentheses: To make simple method calls less inherently ""heavy"".",1323910259

- Texture display in the viewport. Somewhat amazingly, Blender doesn't seem to support this. When you're doing UV editing, you can see the polygons that use the UVs you're editing mapped with the texture you've selected as being visible in the UV editor, but that's about it. The sort of textured display that I'd expect, where all polygons are displayed textured with the texture(s) from their material, doesn't seem to exist.<p>- No N-sided polygon support. Yes, seriously. Quads or tris or nothing! So I think there's a mode where it works like MAX, where it works in tris but hides some of the edges to fool you (N-gons I think they call it), but I couldn't work out how to make this happen. (And there's some guy rewriting the mesh editing core to support N-sided polygons, but it's not done yet.) This caused me a big problem: Blender kept getting in my way! No way to create a rectangle with 6 verts, that's going to get an edge in the next step that splits it into two, because Blender will turn the intermediate result into triangles, forcing me to clean things up -- an extra step, that I didn't want, nor did I need. Now, maybe there is some special tool that I should be using, that does this in a Blender fashion -- but, seriously, I don't care. I can do things my way in every other package.
>>><p>Blender is one of the very few programs that has successfully moved me to tears of sheer frustration (funnily enough, I am very unlikely ever to try using it again), but plenty of people get on with it fine so it could just be me.<p>Regardless of my own inability to get to grips with it, I did think that the two limitations I describe above are kind of ridiculous for a 3D modelling package in 2010 - and I still think that. Every other package I've used just lets you jump in and create polygons with as many edges as you like, and shows you each material's texture in the viewport as you do it. Even if you can jump through some hoops to ge blender to do that too, that's too much - these things are basic features...",1323909241

It's more that property is an institution that develops from organic human action and self-organization. And in his vision people end up self-organizing into groups that will defend some version of property rights using threat of violence if necessary, and he goes further and thinks that, due to the nature of the market of violence, most will converge onto roughly similar versions of property that are best suited for human living.<p>My take on that is that this has already happened, but as it turns out the market of violence lends itself to aggregation and monopoly. We call this monopoly supplier of violence the State, which has found it utility maximizing to form a set of contracts, implicit and explicit, with most of the different parts of society, including price discrimination, loss leaders, etc.<p>In other words, Rothbard left out public choice and the economics of the firm, and when you add those into anarcho-capitalism you get... social democracy.<p>I deeply admire, though, his capability to imagine a different, more decentralized, and free-er world.

For instance, specifically saying what is a header, what's the best html structure for it and a couple css examples.<p>Some might think it's stupid or impossible, but I don't think so. How many simple header/2 columns/footer websites are they? Why are they all differently constructed.. Some uses #contents, others #main-container, others #wrapper, others #wrap, etc etc.<p>With a great specification for common patterns, it would be possible to document a HTML document by saying, for instance, this page respect the design #18. By that, you could clearly see the doc and it'd show a clear header/3 columns/footer page with all ids and classes used.<p>It'd make it easier for designers to submit design for project (Think Zen Css for instance). A css could be shared with different websites that use the same 'patterns'.<p>Think a little bit like the Gammas pattern; some love them, some have them, but we can't deny their usefulness when <i>communicating</i> or <i>documenting</i> a page. For instance, it's way easier to say: I've used the visitor and composite pattern for this tree of blabla rather than describing all the inner details. (Please, don't reply how Gamma patterns are in fact anti-patterns or lack of features of the language, I'm just stating that as example as what I mean by protocol, interface or pattern.)<p>Finally, it would just plainly make html, css (and maybe even Javascript) code less randomly hacked and easier to maintain. It'll be even easier for beginners to get started.

This causes musicians to vie for the favors of the industry they profess to despise.<p>These guys going out and actually making it happen on their own (even if the initial entrants have a historical advantage) will erode that sense of entitlement, and thus erode the willingness to submit to the industry that artists have.<p>Eventually, hopefully, musicians will be busting ass, giving away their music to fans early in their career, and getting increased funding/patronage as they go along, just like every other artist has since ancient times, not positioning themselves for a deal and being depressed if there's no A&R people at their big show.

 - no customer service page with email address or method for inquiries
 - generally no contact info that includes legal company name, address, local phone number
 - No 'login' link on the home page that would indicate an account is set up after the first order, that would allow you to manage orders once placed.
 - A blurry photo with only twitter IDs for contact
 - No references or recommendations or affiliations that help me trust you.
 - No conditions of use, or copyright, or privacy notice which are kind of standard on commerce sites.<p>I get you are probably in a YC cohort based on the orange Y background in the fuzzy photo. But unless you are only marketing to others in YC, the 800# and lack of all other ways to contact you is not at all confidence inspiring in terms of giving money to you, to the general public.<p>All that, combined with a business model where you bill it all up front, it could be perceived as a little suspect. So not one specific thing, for me a bundle of indicators. Hope that helps.",1323907346

It's just a screen name, it's not like you can't just make another one. Even if it's based on IP address, <i>hacker</i> news should be full of people that know how to get around that.<p>Just sayin' - if you've got something smart, constructive to say, say it. Who cares about banning if it's what you really believe in?<p>My personal rule about posting is simple: if a future employer links my HN profile to the ""real"" me, would that be grounds for not getting the job (or losing a job with my current employer)? If yes, then it's probably neither smart nor constructive, so doesn't belong on HN.",1323907242

And, I'm actually only deeply emotionally invested in friends and family, too.  I might have gone overboard on the emotional, bleeding into the cyberbully arena.<p>My primary issue is the, ""it doesn't matter,"" as a correct choice. It might be the correct choice that it doesn't matter if someone calls you a fag on the internet, you should shrug it off and carry on, or ignore it altogether. I read angersocks answer as basically saying it's OK to go into online communities and disrupt them because they don't matter, but they do. People wouldn't take time to type all this stuff out, to talk to each other, to engage, if it never mattered.<p>A community works to create an atmosphere and an environment, if it didn't matter they wouldn't try to maintain it.  I do believe that the communities we create online matter and its a wonderful thing when a community can maintain itself respectfully. I guess I just feel that discussion and exchanging ideas is important face-to-face or online, and we should invest enough to show respect.",1323907238

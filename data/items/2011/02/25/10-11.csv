The idea was having all the things I needed in a single, concise package.

The result is a single file (graph.js) with lots of things besides visualization (eigenvector centrality etc.) which seemed better suited to Pattern than integrating another, bigger project.<p>Best,\nTom",1298631014

But I don't like this update at all: There are still too many what-if's and classification problems (where do you stop?).

What is a whitehat SEO to do, but claim a few Keyword-In-Domains. Now KID's start to become more and more greyhat. Not because claiming a KID is so bad, but because Google has problem ranking relevancy over KID's.<p>Having a curated content farm, in itself is not a problem and perfectly whitehat. If its a good idea after this update, time will tell. I would really like to know if curated content farms with an editorial staff will be hurt by this update. I don't feel safe right now at all.<p>P.S. I guess I've found the first blackhat technique to combat being classified a low-quality non-unique site. Google says to add value. So you pull in content from multiple sources, instead of a single source, you article spin the content a little, you add reviews and comments, and then you comment on/review your own stories. Content farms will turn into comment/review farms, and no one will be the wiser.<p>Also affiliate sites (Google always had you in her sights) and ecommerce sites that used the supplied product descriptions  will have a harder time now. Realistically that would include smarter affiliate sites like hackerbooks.com (no unique content, just an Amazon storefront for all Google cares)",1298630391

They were literally around the corner, but no police at the station (1pm on a weekday) and they gave us the paperwork to fill out for the police report but never actually looked me in the eye. I really don't think they'd care enough to actually stop the crime, unless it started targeting locals.",1298628249

Maybe that doesn't fit your definition of successful, but I'd argue that having a good, stable, professional job was not only successful, but being, in the majority of cases, off the back of a decent education, pretty fortunate too.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.americablog.com/2011/01/us-income-distribution-2010-edition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americablog.com/2011/01/us-income-distribution-20...</a>",1298628182

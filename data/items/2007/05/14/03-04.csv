I think the sense of wonder and endless opportunities put forth by the author perfectly describes a nontechnical user of new web services. While you may say it is naive, I would say it is genuine and pure.<p>Consider the ""Epidemic Watcher"" idea. This could be easily implemented with the Google Maps API, tied to a medical news aggregator and partnered with WebMD. Now it may sound silly to watch a particularly nasty strain of the common cold march its way across the Midwest, but the idea becomes vastly more interesting when you start to plot SARS, Avian Flu, West Nile, etc. <p>Combine News articles and a graphical geological representation of an infections march and I think you might actually have a winner on your hands.<p>Although, the vast majority of the sites visitors may be hypochondriacs at least you have a good idea who to target your advertising to. <p>  ",1179115191

He came here in the 80's because of the weather (no kidding), given an existing research environment similar to Europe.<p>Before landing here I thought the USA was a great country. But my preconceptions have fallen.<p>I am aware I have started a thread that is drifting way off topic and can potentially get very personal. If you'd like to discuss the issue further over a beer, that'd be great. We can then talk about why I pay almost identical income taxes in the USA and in Spain, and yet here my money doesn't seem to come back to me. You can reach me at my surname at ucla edu.",1179113328
21861,comment,21857,21857,0,0,staunch,,,"I'm curious what other people think about sticking around after you've been bought? Would you have your deal terms include you getting to walk away immediately? Would you try to stick it out?<p>Mark Fletcher has said something about making an effort to ensure Ask Jeeves was happy with their acquisition of Bloglines. He hinted that he did this to maintain his reputation.<p>The Reddit acquisition seems like a pretty typical scenario. Aaron Swartz clearly had no desire to stick out in the Big Evil Corp after he got his check, while the other guys are managing to (so far). I can't help but wondering whether Aaron hurt himself seriously for future acquisitions by leaving in a tumultuous way.\n",1179113278

Google doesn't advertise but when they do talk about their service they talk about the products.... the specifics of the product.<p>I am constantly amazed at the number of people who put vague bs on their sites.<p>I can't count the number of times I've gone to a website where I thought they might have a solution to a problem I'm having (specific) or a need I have (again, specific) and seen a lot of vague bullshit that left me wondering, or unable to determine exactly what it is they do. <p>",1179111618

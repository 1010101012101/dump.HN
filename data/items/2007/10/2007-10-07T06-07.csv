Can you really know who might want to buy you?<p>Good advice from an old boss: DO NOT include words like kludge, bug, garbage, or swear words in code or checkin comments.  All production code has kludges, bugs, and fscking garbage in it but making it easy for a due diligence auditor to grep it can't help.<p>[True story, at MusicBlvd.com I was ordered to write a SUID root program to move html files from staging to production directories.  I protested but wrote it anyway and named it kludge.c.  After we were bought by CDNow I found out they had a SUID root bash shell on _every single frontend machine_.  Kludge indeed.]",1191740184

In fact, I think if anything that will increase the gap between the best and the worst of them.  They are becoming even less of a commodity than previously, which was not at all.    ",1191739123

Reasoning about code visually will not only make programming more accessible, but it will allow us to apply spatial reasoning skills to the task of writing applications.  Flow-based programming seems to have the best chance of getting this sort of thing off the ground: <a href=""http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/</a>",1191737520

Early on I realized that grades weren't that important and the best thing about going to school was having time to take huge intellectual risks with few consequences. In addition to the basic computer science concepts I learned, I also took on personal projects that caught my interest.<p>Through these projects I learned new ways of making things using current technologies like Ruby on Rails, Python, Mapreduce, Amazon S3 (and friends), Lisp, and other technologies that someone simply fulfilling the graduate requirements would likely not have learned. I also met great people along the way who were far more impressive than any programmer, designer, or manager I've met in the industry.<p>Oddly enough, now I'm in grad school, hacking the iPhone for a degree.<p>Eventually, I imagine that my continual curiosity will bring me to the startup arena, or perhaps to the international sphere.",1191737372

747367,comment,747009,747204,0,0,catzaa,,,"> It's accurate that what we have is not insurance. Real health insurance would look more like life insurance, with fixed premiums that can't increase if your health degrades over time.<p>That is what I have. It is called a “hospital plan”. It only covers me when I am in an accident and need to go to the hospital. And it is amazing what cost savings it induces over people with full blown medical schemes.<p>I found that things such as spectacles is over priced by 300%-400% (you can get away a lot cheaper). Dentists will take useless digital x-rays to rape a medical scheme – and most people don’t mind because they aren’t paying for it. Doctors also take useless digital ex-rays (for any slight back problem) - even though they aren’t experts and will only look at it for a few seconds. Doctors sometimes prescribe the newest (and most expensive) anti-biotic instead of a cheaper thing that will also do the trick. 
Paying out of pocket eliminates all that.",1249640899

747364,comment,747009,747345,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I completely agree with you analysis of all the problems with the American system, though I'd suggest a different way to address the problem because there's some very real downsides to Austria's system as well.<p>For fixing America's medical and insurance - in lieu of of free higher education, it'd be simple to drastically reduce requirements to practice medicine. To practice medicine in the United States, doctors have to go through crazy rites of passage, including years of their lives and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Groups like the American Medical Association have intentionally tried to keep the requirements very high, as that keeps doctors' fees and wages up by restricting supply.<p>Undergraduate + medical school + residency is way more than necessary to become a competent doctor. Could anyone really claim with a straight face that 4 years of intense study, plus 2-4 years of hands-on apprenticeship wouldn't far more than enough to practice a specific kind of medicine? People pick up many skillsets as difficult as medicine to a competent degree in a lot less than 10 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars of costs.<p>As for Austria, it's an interesting case, huh? Austria has one of the longest traditions of social services in Europe - Otto von Bismarck, Prussian Chancellor, was huge on it. Austria has lots of practice and does a pretty good job of offering a number of services.<p>There's a few downsides, though. Of course, most people have probably heard the argument about how it slows growth and innovation, and there's some truth in that. Typically people counterargue, ""Yes, but it's a worthy tradeoff to improve quality of life in the present."" And there's merit in that too.<p>But using Austria as a specific example - one of the real dangers of socialization of important elements of an economy is that it makes it much easier for the government to go totalitarian, as was seen under the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, the National Socialist German Workers' Party.<p>Limited socialism can work with a very strong constitution to limit governmental powers. But without that, politicians become in control of the courts, military, and economy. That's a very dangerous combination.<p>One of the tricky parts about socialism is that it can't adjust fast enough to fill diverse wants and needs. Governments are rock-and-hard-placed: A fast moving, fast changing government makes lots of mistakes. A slow moving, slow changing government doesn't adapt very fast.<p>But one thing socialism is really, really, realy good at is making what Clauswitz (another Austrian-Prussian, genius military scholar) called ""total war"". That's where your entire economy, culture, and civilization is focused on conquering or destroying another civilization.<p>Every major combatant during World War II went to a more socialized economy, including the United States and England. Government assumed control of much of the production and media. The Allies needed to, because the Germans and Japanese were that focused. One of the reasons that France fell is because it was severely overwhelmed in terms of technology: Less aircraft, less artilery, less mechanized infantry. The American and English governments saw this, and took greater control over their economies.<p>But could any of this have happened without government control of economies in the first place? A charismatic, psychopathic Austrian-Prussian Lance Corporal took over leadership of the National Socialist Worker's Party (Nationalsozialistische, shorthand ""Nazi""), and they already had large control over the nation's factories, food, banking, education, medicine, media, and so on. The ""trusting the government"" culture lets the inevitable bad government run by a psychopath run amok.<p>You could take North Korea as another example - they have the fourth largest army in the world (fourth! despite being #47 in total population!). All they produce effectively is military, but they do a pretty good job of it.<p>So a bit of a tangent there - I'm with your analysis completely about why the costs are high in the United States. I just also point out the very real dangers of state control of the economy. More government power leads to an easier path to totalitarianism and aggressive war. That's one of the reasons Bismarck, a real expansionary conquerer type himself, introduced the culture of social services to Prussian Austria. It builds national loyalty, especially with government-run education. It endears the people to the government and makes them reliant on it. And it lets them flip into ""war mode"" easily when the political leadership wants to.<p>There can be some advantages, but there's quite real dangers. I share the take as a casually interested historian, and would be very happy to hear some other people's replies and analysis.",1249640452

Anyways, it's annoying when they're reiterating the same line all the time...<p>""Ryanair promises four things: low fares, a good on-time record, few cancellations and few lost bags.""<p>Fares aren't low. Easyjet beats them most of the time. Their prices are low only on the front page. It's only 30£ both ways... just add 50£ airport fees (I wonder why other airlines charge only <10£ for the same airport) each way, 20£ if you want to add even 1 piece of luggage, 10£ if you don't opt-out of fast boarding and we're going to ask you to select your nationality many times (only slightly indicating that by doing that you agree to buy insurance). Oh, and 10-15£ fee for handling any credit card at the end. And other things...<p>So you end up paying ~200£ for a flight that's advertised as 30£. They also wanted to be excluded some time ago from services that listed their real prices.<p>Oh and on-time flights... that's easy - just say that a 3h flight will take 3.5h - this way they're always 'on time' and passengers can wait some time at the airport (I'm used to arriving 30 min. early on my usual flight)",1249640019

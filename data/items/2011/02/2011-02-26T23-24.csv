I'm new to this site and by no means technical, but my business mind and communication skills are top notch, especially when it comes to adding creativity or designing schemes to target consumers and opening new doors for all markets of business. So, with all the great minds who share here, how about we join forces as a community and accomplish something fairly simple. Let’s start with REDBOX, the movie rentals, currently with over 26,000 locations. What can we add to their pre-existing big red box to create a community revenue stream? Think out loud people, even if it’s stupid as hell. My initial thoughts would be to add a small blue box that dispenses unique items, possibly 3-D glasses for movies or a coupon dispenser for stores within a particular radius. The consumer is in motion spending money, what can we put inside that blue box? Remember, consider the stores that allows the big red box, our offerings must be unique and can’t clash to strongly with high profit items sold inside the stores.
Disposable 3-D glasses<p>Coupons (Bar-code Scan-able promotions, Macy’s??)<p>Subway/Metro passes for major cities (convenience)<p>Movie reviews from Youtube Links (sponsored by?? Coca-cola) maybe it’s a blue video box??<p>Maybe each blue box caters to its specific demographics??<p>Maybe it’s not a box, possibly a video screen similar to GAS-TV, maybe we can rent a space on each giant REDBOX and sell bulk ad’s to massive locations complimenting in-store items??

With so many new scientist moving in and political motivation to beat those communists, it sounds only natural that there was an outburst of technology at that era.<p>Meanwhile in northern European countries (I'm seeing this mostly in Finland's perspective) had to play nice and humble with the Soviet union it being geologically right next to it. In addition to that Finland had huge amount of war reparations to pay due to losing winter and continuation wars against Soviet Union. 
Also since Soviet Union was the other big player of that time, with its own space programs and so on, it was only natural that the brightest minds in technological perspective went to Soviet universities and did their possible contributions there (I'm not expert of this matter but I remember reading there was at least some level of brain leakage during that era)
Fall of Soviet union wasn't either that good of a change for Nordic countries since Soviet Union was one of our biggest sources of export.<p>Of course this is all just historical blabbering the real deal being imho the fact that in Nordic countries are good places in average, which means we do well in global rankings like PISA tests, but for technological innovation and economical rise it usually is the right side of gaussian curve that is needed.

Assuming these stats aren't totally bunk, something's gotta change in that statement to avoid massive cognitive dissonance.",1298761477

I just don't see why it all has to be wrapped in so many layers. GET /posts.json should return a list, GET /posts/1.json should return an object, and DELETE /post/1.json should result in a HTTP 204 if successful. In the case of errors, the response's status code and an object with exception information should suffice.",1298761428

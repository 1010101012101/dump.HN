Store owners do get to pick and choose what they're going to sell. You can't just come up with whatever lame product, show up at Best Buy or Amazon headquarters and demand that they start selling it in their stores. What in the world makes this guy or anyone else think the App Store is somehow an exception?""<p>Well, the problem is that Apple has made so that theirs is the only store in the world.  If your store doesn't want to stock my book, it's not a problem, I can always go to the bookstore across the street and cut a deal with them.  But if I write an app for the iPhone, the <i>only</i> place that I can sell it is the App Store.<p>That being the case, developers are going to see Apple being fickle about what apps are accepted/rejected, and they are going to start asking themselves is it worth the risk to spend 6 months developing an app just to discover that it can never even be put on the market.<p>Apple risks losing developers if they continue with this, and that doesn't help their cause.",1220597154

This guy, a tour guide in Tuscany, wrote some books make for light but entertaining reading:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url?_encoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Dario%20Castagno"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url?_encodin...</a><p>I think there's something to be said for simply wandering though (perhaps armed with some good books), especially seeing as how there is way more history and stuff to see in a place like Italy or France than you could possibly hope to absorb over a few weeks.  It's ""fractal"", too: you can look at the big ticket items, like wars, conquests of this or that country, but you can also get into the local goings on, which are often quite interesting in their own right.<p>For instance, one of my favorite things in Padova is the University Tour, where they have a lectern that Galileo's students built for him.  It's awful looking, because they were wealthy kids, not the sons of craftsmen, so they mangled it pretty thoroughly.  They wanted to make it themselves though, rather than commission it, as a sign of dedication.",1220596414
295627,story,,,21,10,ttol,"Bootstrapping to the Extreme (or ""Consulting Your Way to Millions"")",,"I've wanted to write a quick note on here for awhile but kept getting tied up. However, reading Paul Graham's recent essay, ""A Fundraising Survival Guide"" (www.paulgraham.com/fundraising.html), it touched upon some aspects that I had wanted to write about and how it relates to my latest venture.<p>PG wrote about bootstrapping and how that equates to consulting.  Yes, bootstrapping DOES work.  I've taken that idea to the extreme .. quite literally.  My third company, Boylston Technology Group, is purely driven by consulting.  The site is www.boylstontech.com, but a web site overhaul is slated to happen very shortly in the future so please excuse the ambiguities that currently exist.<p>At the moment, we have 15 people with offices in a great location in downtown Boston (directly above a Starbucks and the Arlington T stop).  We work with large clients and have even managed to secure an endorsement from Maria Shriver for the firm (She is great).  We expect to grow out of these offices shortly, although since we've only been here 9 months, we may use this space as a satellite office until the lease is up.  Our revenue is in the seven figures and we are profitable.<p>This is my third startup and when I was doing my first two, Y Combinator didn't exist so I had to learn through trial and error.  The lessons I learned from i2hub and from other ventures were invaluable.<p>However, I am not building to flip, but building to last.  I am very metrics driven and have a need to see gains and losses in a measurable concrete way.  Revenue is a strong focus for consulting services, as that business is the corner stone of a larger strategy.  I'll get to that in a minute.  I've also invested in infrastructure internally: we've custom built a platform to run our business. It runs off of webdevelopment.net, a domain we own.  Every member of our company uses this system and our clients use it as well.  It allows us to manage, plan, communicate internally as well as externally with the client.<p>My larger strategy is to get the consulting services to a point where it runs itself and is a foundational support piece of a larger business ecosystem with other companies we operate.  Once it runs itself, it then effectively becomes a funding engine and will fuel the development of the other companies.  One part is product R&D.  We think we have a good web-based product and have begun development -- far enough where we've got paying piloted customers.  A two-day trial brought $36K worth of licenses.<p>The other company-to-be is an internal financial trading tool.  We've created an alpha version of a software that automatically trades commodities with a proprietary algorithm.  The algorithm and the software was tested last year for two months on a small segment of the market and it produced $250K in revenue.  To test it on a larger scale will require more attention from us, and to this end, we've secured about 100 servers in preparation.<p>Mid to long-term, I'd like to form symbiotic business relationships between the three entities and leverage the strengths of them:
consulting services will provide the technical skillset and the initial funding,
the product development R&D will provide greater potential scalability business-wise, 
and the automated commodity trader will later on provide diversification as well as additional funding.  
Once the trifecta has been created, the plan is to then expand to another business either through ground-up or via acquisition.<p>As you're probably already thinking, with several different types of businesses, management will become an issue.  To this end, we've already started scouting a management team.  One of our recent hires has over 15 years experience in project management and is writing a book on project management processes.  We're also currently looking for a senior sales director, and then shortly after that we will be looking for a general manager for the consulting business.  This will escalate me out of the consulting business and allow me to then focus on either product R&D or the financial trading tool and repeat the stabilization process there.<p>So, if you <i>only</i> need capital and not the great ancillary benefits belonging  to YC gives you, bootstrapping does indeed work, and has allowed our company to grow and scale without outside funding. In my scenario, bootstrapping became a business unto itself.<p>Quick about me:
My first startup was, at the time, a top-rated news site which ranked higher than craigslist, nike, and walmart, etc.  My second startup, i2hub, was the number one file sharing service on colleges, with some interesting partners (one which eventually became the creators of the Graffiti app on Facebook, and the other was the Winklevoss brothers from ConnectU).  Between my first and second startup, I also had a lot of experience working with companies like the original Napster with Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, and several others.  I've also either written or been involved with projects such as Lancraft, Tribes 2, TetriNET 1 & 2, Nestea2, and was an IRC Admin on the oldest network, EFNet.

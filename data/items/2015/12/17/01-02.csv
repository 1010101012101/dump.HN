The most obvious are the lack of store-and-forward for messages to offline users and the poor to nonexistent support for persistent chat rooms (my solution: a &quot;conference call&quot; that&#x27;s been going for weeks without anyone having turned on the audio). It&#x27;s also very bad at handling changes in network connectivity, docking/undocking my laptop drops me from IM for at least a couple of minutes and often requires a restart of S4B.<p>I will agree that the softphone support is pretty good, but it&#x27;s non-interoperable with our VoIP environment so it goes almost entirely unused. Unfortunately this has been the case everywhere I&#x27;ve worked except for one place that had WebEx and Cisco phones - those would get along with each-other sometimes if you were lucky, but it wasn&#x27;t very reliable.<p>My point is that I&#x27;ve found the office communications landscape to be a terrible backwater of technology. I dislike Slack but I can see why it&#x27;s taking off - most of the on-prem options for IM fail at basic IM features while adding VoIP/telepresence options that are non-interoperable and complex to implement and support. It says something that my employer has multiple FTEs dedicated to scheduling and setting up the videoteleconference rooms, because it takes a specialist just to make a call these days.",1450317505

This would severely curtail the number of outlier cases the software has to be ready for, be actually safe, and allow for awesome quality of life improvement for commuters on those routes who can do something else while commuting.

So, given that, if there&#x27;s something I want an OS to do that Linux can&#x27;t do, I would be motivated to work on making Linux able to do that thing so I could do that thing on an Open Source OS I enjoy using, rather than work on replicating Windows so I could do that thing on an open source OS I don&#x27;t enjoy using.<p>But, it seems there are people who genuinely enjoy Windows more than Linux (or BSD), and are willing to work for <i>17 years</i> in pursuit of being able to run an Open Source Windows version.

That&#x27;s reasonable enough.<p>Tesla may have set the field back.  They released their &quot;autopilot&quot; as a beta, didn&#x27;t provide sensors to enforce driver hands-on-wheel, shipped a system that works well only on freeways but will engage on other roads, and claimed that if it crashes, it&#x27;s the driver&#x27;s fault. Everybody else shipping similar capabilities (BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, etc.) has put more restrictions on them (such as a hands-on-wheel sensor) to avoid over-reliance on the automation.  Now Tesla has had to remove some features from their &quot;autopilot&quot;.[1]<p>Google may be able to get approval for their 25MPH max speed mini-car operating without driver hands-on-wheel, on the basis of the slow speed.  Google&#x27;s system is much more advanced, and has a detailed model of what everything else moving around it is doing.<p>Expecting the human driver to take over if the automation fails will not work. The limits of human monitoring are well known from aircraft automation.  It takes seconds to tens of seconds for a pilot to grasp the situation and recover properly if the autopilot disconnects in an upset situation.  That&#x27;s for pilots, who are selected and trained much better than drivers, and who go through elaborate simulator training in which failures are simulated.  Watch &quot;Children of the Magenta&quot;[2], where a chief pilot at American Airlines talks to his pilots about this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/12/16/tesla-to-limit-self-driving-functions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/12/16/tesla-to-...</a> \n[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN41LvuSz10"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN41LvuSz10</a>",1450317062

Someone does a &quot;rude&quot; merge, or an illegal U-turn—and everybody just modifies their own driving to let it happen, even though it&#x27;s &quot;against the rules.&quot; On the road, I&#x27;m not really trusting other drivers individually; I&#x27;m trusting traffic as a fluid.<p>My big worry is that we&#x27;ll have autonomous-car-AI monoculture. If that happens, we&#x27;d lose the advantage of the &quot;compensation&quot; other drivers in traffic can do. We could end up seeing car-behavioral &quot;prions&quot;: glitches in car software that cause a strange behavior, which in turn triggers the <i>same</i> glitch in the cars attempting to compensate for that behavior. You could see, for example, every car getting into a state where it thinks it needs to swerve &quot;more right than other cars&quot; to avoid an emergency, and thus an entire &quot;pack&quot; of cars driving off the road and into a fast clockwise-torquing circle.<p>Or, less eyecatching but more fatal in the near-term, you could see a monoculture-wide decision that works alright for single driverless cars, but actively harms drivered cars (and other driverless cars with other-model AIs) when the majority of a &quot;pack&quot; of cars is from the monoculture. For example, I could see a &quot;pack&quot; of driverless cars all deciding to jam on the brakes at once (because, say, a bunch of spike-strips suddenly popped out of the road in between them or somesuch)—leaving the one drivered car boxed in by them to keep going and crash into the vanguard of the pack.",1450317033

The majority of my wealth is in them, after all.<p>The parent poster, however, is asking &quot;What&#x27;s the catch?  Where&#x27;s the trade-off to investing in index funds, and what sort of new systemic risks does widespread adoption of them bring to the financial system?&quot;  He&#x27;s right to ask that: there is <i>always</i> a catch, because the financial system is about distributing & incentivizing the wealth of society and doesn&#x27;t directly produce any wealth itself.<p>I&#x27;m saying that the catch is in diminishing returns from the index itself.  A well-subscribed index fund, by definition, will always give you the median return of the market it tracks.  I&#x27;m saying that the effect of large amounts of capital pouring into index funds is that the mean and median returns will diverge.  Market inefficiencies become more prevalent as fewer eyes are on each business; as a result, people who successfully exploit them become richer than they would otherwise.  Wealth becomes increasingly more concentrated in the few people that actively invest (usually with insider information) and do so <i>successfully</i>.  Passive investors continue to make the median return, but the median return falls further behind the mean return.<p>We&#x27;re seeing exactly this phenomena right now.  I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else who has explicitly linked it to the rise of index funds & passive investing, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s related.",1450316652

I haven&#x27;t looked closely yet at what the author did, and I&#x27;ve forgotten some details of what I did, but I can speak generally to our implementation comparing branching and branchless.<p>For repeated lookups, the first couple levels will all be hit in L1 cache regardless of which way the comparison goes.  The branch prediction penalty is about 15 cycles, and the L1 access is about 5.   The next level might be in L2 at 12 cycles, then the next few levels are in L3, with a ~40 cycle access time, then RAM with 100+ cycles of access.  The last few accesses will be within the same 64B cacheline (128B with buddy prefetch), and thus will be in L1 after the first access.<p>The branchless conditional move approach has a data dependency, while the branching &quot;if&quot; approach is a control dependency.  Modern processors &quot;run ahead&quot; with speculative execution past control dependencies (executing the instructions for one branch but not retiring them), while the conditional moves are issued but cannot be executed until the corresponding comparison has been made.<p>Because of speculative execution, the branching approach effectively has a 50% accurate automatic prefetcher that runs several iterations ahead.  The math works out so that for some access patterns this can be a significant advantage.  The speed gap can be closed (and if I remember correctly, reversed) by adding explicit prefetch instructions to branchless approach.   The branching approach can also benefit from judicious use of prefetch, so that each branch fetches acts as a prefetch for the opposite branch, which makes for faster recover after a branch prediction error.<p>As the author concluded, we also found that a batch approach could be beneficial.   You can mitigate latency from RAM (and even from L3) if you can arrange to have about 10 outstanding requests at a time.   For a single core, batch and prefetch approaches had similar top speeds.  For multicore (untested) presumably the excessive memory bandwidth of the &quot;wrong&quot; prefetches would give the advantage to batch.  Similar to the author&#x27;s experience on Broadwell, we found that on Haswell the SIMD gather had minimal advantage over repeated scalar loads.  We have a Skylake machine coming soon, and are hoping the hardware gather approach might finally take the lead.",1450316474

There was no big clean up with the data. Sometimes you get a data set and find out it has errors or wrong information. Everywhere we turned this data pointed us correctly...When we got the data I spent a week or more playing around with it – sorts and counts, which officers got written up the most number of times. Then I started looking at certain types of offenses, like “he had both a domestic violence and an excessive force.” From that I created a list of 150-200 officers. Once we had a nice healthy pool of targets we tried to find out more details on them by asking for the reports on the incidents.</i><p>> <i>&quot;This was a case where the government had this wonderful, informative dataset and they weren’t using it at all except to compile the information. I remember talking to one person at an office and saying: “How could you guys not know some of this? In five minutes of (SQL) queries you know everything about these officers?” They basically said it wasn&#x27;t their job. That left a huge opportunity for us.&quot;</i><p>via the 538 article, this sentiment is repeated:<p>> <i>The city had the tools to identify and curtail troublesome officers before Kalven pursued legal action. All of the complaints were stored within the department long before the Invisible Institute had access. As Kalven put it, “All the knowledge to transform the system existed within the system.”</i><p>edit: The 538 article is greatly appreciated...I didn&#x27;t even know of the Citizens Police Data Project, and now I do...but skimming the dataset, I would take a different approach than the one implied in the 538 article title. A good data investigation doesn&#x27;t have to come up with a statistical model for predicting bad behavior. A simple group-by-count is devastating enough. It is merely enough to show that with a simple aggregation of tabular data, we see that the majority of police officers are doing &quot;fine&quot; -- but that&#x27;s not the point. The point is that when police officers are <i>egregiously</i> and <i>repeatedly</i> bad, there is apparently no institutional mechanism to root that out. And we have little reason to expect that to change if, God forbid, more and more police officers decide to go bad.<p>In other words, we can argue that Chicago cops are generally good/great. But the fact that we don&#x27;t have as many cop-problems as we hypothetically <i>could</i> is a matter of luck and faith in human behavior and actions within a bureaucracy...Faith in the human spirit is a nice feel-good thing -- like believing the next shuttle will safely launch even though the Challenger just blew up --  but when it comes to public safety and justice, it is imperative to demand more. If the police loathe releasing disciplinary data (nevermind it being the law, of course), they should consider being a bit more proactive in policing themselves and removing the low-hanging bad apples.",1450315643

There&#x27;s something extremely satisfying about accumulating elements backward by consing, and then reversing at the end. I&#x27;m always worried in Ruby/Python that push()ing elements onto an Array might do all sorts of stupid re-allocations at just the wrong time; lists, on the other hand, have extremely <i>obvious</i> time-space complexities for all their operations.<p>That&#x27;s something that can be said about all the Erlang ADTs, now that I think about it—each one has been carefully considered such that you can guess the time/space complexity for each operation and be correct. Erlang (and Elixir) also has a policy that if two ADTs both have an operation with the same <i>semantics</i>, but the two operations have different <i>complexities</i>, then the two operations will get different names—which is amazing for making bad ideas (like trying to do random-access on a list) obvious.<p>(And really, while we&#x27;re on the subject, it&#x27;s <i>tuples</i> that are the weird Erlang type. As handy as they are as an underlying implementation for records <i>et al</i>, there isn&#x27;t really much theoretical basis for having a set of N fixed-size non-enumerable product types, each with integer-indexed, <i>untyped</i> slots.)",1450315103

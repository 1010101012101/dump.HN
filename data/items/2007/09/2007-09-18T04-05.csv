56117,comment,55556,55680,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I'd agree with everything here except to say pick a date for 4 weeks <i>after</i> you're ready. If you want a big launch, don't schedule it for the day you've just finished that last bug. Make sure you're really ready and then in those last 4 weeks you'll discover all those things you thought were finished aren't. Otherwise you're a big chance to miss the launch date and not be ready, that's bad news. ",1190091166

If I don't like it, I can say, ""another suggestion!""<p>And allow it to order one new outfit every 4-6 months based on which outfits I've been wearing, so I don't have to go to the mall to buy clothes.

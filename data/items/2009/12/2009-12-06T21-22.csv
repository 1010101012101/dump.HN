They just seem too me too esque and want to offer you things you probably shouldn't be spending on.  The things I should be spending on like a lawyer or accountant (thats debatable depending on your stage/finances) I will get through a personal referral.  I do a lot of events for MIT in Florida and it's often a large number of service providers that show up.  It's good in one sense, because we can educate them on things that are important.  On the other hand, it bothers me, because it detracts the value away from our main attendees- the entrepreneurs.",1260136786

They're interested, they google around for anything about you, and find this post.  They know exactly what your fears are, they know that you're not ramen profitable, and they know that you know that they're coming after you.<p>Which means, they can negotiate you down to a point where they're buying your company for pennies on the dollar.  What's your BATNA? (best alternative to a negotiated agreement) - right now, it's just to continue on, despite the fact that you're losing money.

They say ""well if we just lower the price, more people will buy these books"".<p>That isn't necessarily true because people can only devote so much time to reading. Much of the investment a person makes in a book isn't money (at least not directly) it's time.<p>It's entirely possible that the price of books is set by other factors, such as competing books. People may largely decide they want a book, then shop around, and buy one. Which one they buy may have to do with pricing, in fact that may be the key factor in pricing (if I'm on the fence about two books, I'll go with the one that costs lest).<p>So you can't simply assume that ""if the price is lowered enough publishers may earn less per unit, but could ultimately earn more in overall revenue and profit through a greater number of sales."" It's quite probably untrue.<p>I'd actually argue that if you want to sell more books, you should make them shorter. Fewer pages will get the reader through it faster. I'm sure this will only work to a point, as nobody wants to pick up a ""book"" that feels more like a ""pamphlet"" but perhaps digital media (where all of your ebooks weigh the same as the Kindle you read them on) will change that too.",1260134541

So distributors have to run all aspects of billing and order fulfillment and shipment in return for 20% .<p>Anything over that you have to buy non-returnable or do via special sales (book clubs for instance get more of a discount but buy non-returnable and minimum order size 5000 or 10K books at a time) usually direct from the publisher.<p>10% of the cover price does NOT go to the author, unless he is a bigshot (famous/celebrity) or has a surefire franchise (Stephen King level).<p>Usually, assuming the publisher is fair, the author gets a percentage of the NET amount the publisher gets.  Royalties are easy to calculate these days thanks to software for publishers that keeps track of that.  Example:  $19.95 retail, publisher gets $12.00, author at 10% gets $1.20 (not $2.00 ).  Sometimes foreign language rights are handled differently, sometimes they are the same.<p>Amazon is making the argument that ebook pricing is highly elastic - that if ebooks on LISP programming were 1/10th the price, I would buy 10 times as many of them.<p>Yet books and ebooks have to compete for time and attention against TV, Internet surfing, movies, and my need to sleep; which no doubt explains publishers' wariness.",1260133975

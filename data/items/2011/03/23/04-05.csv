Did you?<p>My notes:<p>- The product photo links to a photo hosting site.<p>- The heading text image is a link that goes back to the same page, which is irritating. No need for a link there.<p>- I suspect you shouldn't be misquoting a real person (Arnie), even as a joke.<p>- There's no closing quotation mark, at least not in Chrome. The text renders a bit awkwardly wrt horizontal whitespace.<p>- Apart from the colour scheme, there doesn't seem to be any connection between the style and branding on the product shot and the style and branding of the page.<p>- I have NFI who your target market is, but faux-insulting me with poorly written copy was a complete turnoff in my case. I found the premise somewhat offensive. It did remind me that I need to buy some more of the brand of face scrub I use, though (which is marketed at men but the only real marketing gimmick is the usual all-natural-aromatherapy-blah BS).<p>- I don't normally respond well to targeted ""men's"" advertising so maybe my dislike is not a good sample, but IMHO you should put some more time into (a) deciding who your target market is (b) deciding what your message to them is apart from ""nah ne nah you're a girl"" and (c) putting together some smoother written copy.<p>My 2c, anyhow.",1300856395

2358092,comment,2358010,2358010,0,0,morrow,,,"Gut reactions\n- is chiefs-skincare.com available?  I'd get that and forward the current url there as it's more clear.  I was seriously confused what I was geting into while the page loaded, almost closed the tab, not sure if people would be dismayed from clicking because of this.<p>- Lotion photo says 2010 on it (minor nit) _unless you meant Established 2010, in which case I'd use that or est. instead.<p>- Clean layout is nice, visually appealing -- I like the use of whitespace.<p>- Couldn't care less about the stereotypical ""be a man, buy X product"" copy, but I understand for some reason that goes with the territory these days.  Maybe stretch the hyperbole even further / incorporate the chief in there somehow to stand out.<p>- I'm guessing with the domain (skincare) and the phrase ""launching soon"", you aren't only going to sell ""Citrus Gel Face Wash"".  I'd reference this somewhere, because as it is now, it looks like a landing page for a single product, which is less interesting than a new line of products, or even better, a new philosophy to approaching the men's skin care industry.<p>- emphasize the ""order now, get a 15% discount option"" (I've only now noticed it on my 5th tab / back and forth)<p>- Get rid of the Arnold quote, I'd only use actual testimonials here or at least if it's going to be comedic, make it relevant.  ""Chief Face wash saved my marriage"" or ""Chief's Products give me so much energy, I don't sleep.  Ever."" that type of stuff.  The girlie man quote is too large, prominent, and irrelevant to make sense to me.<p>- Final message - get rid of the ""take off your dress"" as the ending quote.  It's funny up front, because you're ""catching"" the consumer in the act of using girly face wash, and ""correcting"" their mistake.  However, when trying to presumably capture their e-mail, _ending_ with that quote is overly negative, and the fact you are repeating yourself doesn't help.  I would end with positive copy here, like ""So {ditch the dress}, and get energized with Chief's.  Sign up right now and we'll take 15% off your first purchase with us! [email input].<p>- Speaking of ""take off the dress"", this is also a minor nit and a bit of a silly point, but doesn't ""take off that dress"" sound at least a little bit sexual to you?  I understand the sentiment, but there has got to be a better way to say that haha.<p>Hope this helps, and remember it's just 1 dude's opinion.  Best of luck.",1300856344

The numbers are WHO numbers, and not from Soviet HQ, but the predictions by other groups are all over the map. The WHO one was before there could be solid population measurements, and I don't see evidence of newer data from anyone.<p>One difficulty with the projection is that the author assumes that 4000 is the only number to consider regarding deaths with nuclear power. For roof installation he includes roofing accidents, but it does not include the (rather few) people who have died in industrial accidents with nuclear reactors. These are much fewer than 4,000 but he omits deaths due to mining accidents related to uranium extraction (only saying that it's less than coal) and neither does he use estimates for the deaths corresponding to steel and concrete production, like he does for wind power.<p>To be fair, elsewhere his pages go into the differences in the amount of materials needed for each one, and I think the differences I pointed out above are small corrections to the gross numbers given.",1300856150

These are 16 year old kids, old enough to know right from wrong, and with the knowledge and skills to exploit the system. And once the exploit worked, they didn't then responsibly disclose the problem to PHPFog; they started vandalizing, changing passwords, and the works.<p>This is like someone finding an unlocked door to the apartment building's maintenance office, taking the master keys from there, rifling through a bunch of people's personal belongings, sticking signs in the windows saying ""this building's landlords suck,"" and changing the locks on some of the doors to make it hard to clean up the whole mess.<p>They absolutely are the responsible party; you should never blame the victim of a crime just because the victim didn't take adequate steps to defend themselves. If I accidentally leave my door unlocked one day, that does not make it suddenly OK to come in and take my stuff and it's my fault for not having locked my door, instead of yours for taking my stuff.<p>Now, in this case PHPFog does bear some responsibility, because they have a duty to protect their customers as well as possible, and from reading about how this happened, it sounds like they were amazingly sloppy and irresponsible about it (passwords stored in the clear on the server, passwords shared between various accounts, leaving unsecured shared systems running after beta launch, etc). But that doesn't reduce the culpability of the attackers; they acted maliciously, with full knowledge of what they were doing, vandalized systems, changed passwords, and bragged about it.",1300855875

ASCAP represents ASCAP members, who choose to join the organization. ASCAP then becomes a legal agent regarding collecting royalties for the musician. Many musicians join BMI instead. But crucially, many do not join either organization. Neither organization is a publisher, they are a music licensing organization that works for its members.<p>For this to be comparable, ASCAP would become the representative of musicians whether they want that or not, and would be able to publish musician's works without permission.

But we are going to have to be very careful about how we build them.<p>I don't know about that....even just <i>careful</i> would have sufficed in this case (using an intelligent definition of careful).  Placing your backup generators at low elevation seems like an amazingly bad design choice.  I mean really, how much does it cost to build a very tall tower to house your backup generators?  In projects this capital intensive, it is a rounding error.<p>>What we should be thinking about is what the risk is in future; not what it has been in the past. If I told you I had an energy source that had a known 0.01% of ending the world, each year, but a clean 50 year track record, would you allow me to continue with it? Of course not!<p>Total hyperbole (ending the world)....but your general assertion is absolutely correct.  Nuclear power is statistically by far the safest form of energy, but there is a very large inherent risk, that while not terribly hard to manage, must absolutley be managed properly, without exception.  And I'd say in this case, was not handled properly, at all.<p>I am sadly disappointed in the nuclear industry in general, and also the Japanese...I expect more from them than I expect from other countries.  I may be wrong about one or more things though in this assessment, but that's how I think about it at this point in time.",1300855164

I know because I see it first hand, all the time, including in projects contracted by NASA. There's a ridiculous amount of cross-checking and testing that prevents it from being a serious problem most of the time, but as we can see it can cause oversights that can rear their ugly heads unexpectedly.<p>And this is why it's troubling to see people pushing so hard for nuclear with the battle-cry ""we've figured it all out"". We have to keep having it figured it out as long as the reactor as around, until they are fully decommissioned (which takes many years after they stop being productive). And there have to always be a handful of people who know their shit, always paying attention, and who can somehow resist the bullshit.<p>In 1998 one of the nuclear plants near Toronto, Ontario was taken out of service. During the Fukushima troubles, it sprang a coolant leak into Lake Ontario. Insignificant radiation, they say, and I'm inclined to believe them, but still...

When it comes to code, we want an almost mathematically-provable correctness, but the real world doesn't care. The real world cares about getting something that solves their problem; ugliness, code smells, and technical dept are irrelevant to them. So I wouldn't write off the managers and their fancy business needs as just some conspiracy keeping good coders down. I think this need for pragmatism is something that separates a computer scientist from an engineer.<p>It goes both ways though. Sometimes the shit is just terrible. When the cost of any change is introducing a new bug, you've got to take a stand and I think your insight is spot on here. The developer is in the best position to know when the cost of change has gotten to high. I don't bother asking permission, but I've never had to ask forgiveness either.

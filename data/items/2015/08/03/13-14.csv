The point is that someone pulled over at a traffic stop can keep a gun hidden and take the first shot if they want to. Each and every traffic stop is a nervous bundle of potential danger for a cop, and they aren&#x27;t paid to endanger themselves. That&#x27;s why we go out of our way to make cops comfortable during a traffic stop. Keep your hands where they can be seen. No sudden movements.

Those who want to pay for quality content quickly discover that it&#x27;s incredibly hard to find.<p>The analogy breaks down on the nature of the ads themselves. In physical magazines, ads are static and occupy fixed space on the pages.

9995761,comment,9994963,9995218,0,0,jerf,,,"Oh, the memories. I haven&#x27;t seen this metaphor fight in like 8 years now, since web annotation basically died. And here we finally are with a version of this debate that people actually care about, because there&#x27;s actual money at stake. Finally my years of prep are ready to pay off!<p>First, I suggest everyone resist metaphors. Physical metaphors don&#x27;t work here <i>at all</i>. For one thing, the &quot;free content&quot; may in the future decide that you can&#x27;t load the content in the page until after the ads and trackers confirm that you have indeed loaded their content and executed it to some degree, which wrecks every physical metaphor you can come up with. Physical content is dead. Web content is code. It gets to do code-y things. No physical metaphor will keep up.<p>Next, this obviously produces an arms race. The first iterations of this will be stupid and client-side, because it&#x27;s cheap. When that doesn&#x27;t work, server-side things can be done so that at the very least, you <i>must</i> download the ad; that can be confirmed fairly well in a non-forgeable way. The ads will also run arbitrary bits of code in an attempt to verify that they&#x27;ve really been shown; the client side plugins will retaliate by simulating the relevant code and not actually showing the ad. With the current state of web technology, this would stabilize in a sort of middle ground, where the client-side correctly doesn&#x27;t render the ads, but the requisite requests to convince the server that you can see the content would by necessity still leak tracking information in order to convince the servers to show it at all. You could try to do things like use client-side stuff to scramble those values and share them among users or something, but that&#x27;s fairly easy to detect at scale.<p>Where that becomes particularly relevant though is that the clients at this point are becoming increasingly outright deceptive and duplicitious. Instead of passively failing to render ads, actively deceiving the remote systems opens a new door both legally and ethically. At some point after this the publishers have both a legal and ethical case that you are not merely &quot;experiencing the content as you wish&quot;, but actively defrauding them.<p>This, of course, won&#x27;t stop people from arguing they have a right not to be tracked or advertised at, which means that they will essentially be arguing in favor of a right to have their programs make fradulent requests in order to get this &quot;free&quot; content. Which is fine and dandy locally, but consider what that means globally... and in particular, at this point how do you argue that it&#x27;s ethically wrong to put trackers and ads in content, and for that matter even spyware, if the &quot;other side&quot; is retaliating in kind? If you&#x27;re not careful with the ethics here you surprisingly find that you end up arguing in favor of the very things you thought you were arguing against, and end up making a &quot;good for me but not for thee&quot; argument, which even if you do end up believing that is still not a very powerful or compelling ethical/legal position.<p>Pardon if I&#x27;m leaping about 4 steps further down the road than most people here are at... I worked this all out about 12 years ago. (It&#x27;s a bit dated now and I cringe a bit at the writing style, as befits any writer linking to something they wrote 12 years ago, but you can see what I worked out at <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/blogbook/communication_ethics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/blogbook/communication_ethics</a> .

I&#x27;d much rather PAY some monthly fee that is divvied up between the sites I actually visit over the course of a month. There are a number of service that have attempted this (Flattr being on the top of my head) but none have made it seamless.<p>Mobile is the big sticking point. On the desktop I could use an extension that reads some meta data out of a site&#x27;s head to identify that site and mark it down for receiving a portion of &quot;subscription fee&quot; but on mobile this becomes much more of a challenge as I&#x27;m not willing to switch to a single-purpose browser (not that iOS would make it easy even if I did) and there are no browser extensions on mobile and no, I&#x27;m not going to do some gross &quot;share&quot; hack to record the sites I visit.<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer to all of this, it all sucks.

It was a very entertaining talk covering the business and technical aspects of this project.<p>From the start the art team on Big Hero 6 wanted to make a really big movie.  They envisioned those big sweeping shots of San Fransokyo that made the technical folks shudder.  They have a massive rendering farm at their disposal but still probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to render all the shots in time for the release; for one reason, because the art folks kept making changes, and for another, because they contain so many entities.  A handful of folks on the rendering team built a proof-of-concept renderer with support for the global-illumination look they wanted while also being able to handle the massive scale.<p>As the linked article mentions, the solution was to optimize a massively-parallel algorithm by finding coherent rays that can be efficiently calculated together.  It&#x27;s a batch method: start casting a bunch of rays, identify similar rays and group them, calculate collisions for each group, cast reflected rays, identify similar rays and group them, etc.  What I like about it conceptually is that in a way it treats light as a field rather than as individual directed rays.<p>Their initial tests were rendering an infinite plane of generated buildings.  The dystopian metropolis was mesmerizing, and I think Disney would be wise to come up with some dark plot line to set there.  Anyway, someone way at the top (the director or art director I think) saw the proof-of-concept renderings and decided that it was the perfect tool to attain their vision of this movie, which, by the way, has a hard release date something like three months away.<p>So they proceeded to turn the proof-of-concept into a production-grade renderer in time to render all the frames and save the movie.  And somehow they pulled it off, they released a really beautiful movie, and they wrote a paper about it, too.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.acm.uiowa.edu/uicc/speakers.html#nichols"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acm.uiowa.edu/uicc/speakers.html#nichols</a>",1438608899

Second, I think you deserve some real credit for 1. identifying that you were unemployable and 2. fixing it.<p>However, the real trick is identifying when you&#x27;re unemployable (or even starting to get close to it) before you&#x27;re unemployed. This is a game - and one that you&#x27;ll never really win. But like all games: you keep playing - you get better. The trouble lies in that this is a game in which you need to be ahead of the gamemaster (that is - current and future employers).<p>>  I do think if I found myself unemployable again I could repeat...<p>I want to stop you right there. I think your objective from here out is to make sure you never find yourself unemployable again - rather than waiting and/or hoping it doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>> almost any kind of expertise in a major JavaScript framework like Angular, Ember, or React/Flux might get you a remote job fairly easily<p>These are valuable skills and expertise to have - and they will land you a job - but don&#x27;t let it make you a one tricky pony - as that&#x27;s a fast-track ticket to unemployment. I think few of these front-end frameworks will be here for the long-haul.<p>If I were in your shoes (of course I&#x27;m not in your shoes - it&#x27;s 100% your choice) I would take what you&#x27;ve developed so far and start to dive into the fundamentals and then get the expertise.<p>For example: get to know the architectures of these frameworks: analyze and criticize them, attempt to improve them if you can; learn design patterns and identify the anti-patterns (important !); learn your algorithms - as it is these features that make you a valuable professional in the long run. Not just another PHP/JavaScript/ColdFusion dev.<p>Then you can wade in deeper and build up deep full-stack expertise. You could think about:<p>&quot;Oh how can I optimize view rendering in Angular?&quot;\n&quot;How can I solve head-of-line blocking when using web sockets?&quot;\n&quot;What is the optimal compression algorithm in order to serve JavaScript files for mobile devices?&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t imagine a huge number of people think about how to solve these challenges - but I would bet that a lot of people face them.<p>All the other stuff is just tools to enable you to apply your expertise easier and faster.",1438608860

You are either using ads people don&#x27;t see, or doing terrible things like many Minecraft mods, often downloaded by kids, and  hosted at a particularly nasty site where the obvious download link gives you malware. To block horrible things like that, we also sink anyone trying to use sensible advertisements. Behaving like a good citizen just gives a website less revenue, and gains them pretty much nothing.<p>At least one ad blocker tried to avoid this by marking some advertisements as legitimate/unobtrusive, and not blocking them. That didn&#x27;t fly very well, as the rest of us just claimed that they were in league with advertisers, and just using this unblocking as a different source of revenue.<p>That&#x27;s why the good actors are moving towards mixing advertisements and other content to be so similar as to be impossible to filter. Sponsored stories, content modified to add a few links to advertisers and such. Pay people not to post advertisements on their page, but to actively talk about you in the same way they talk about other things on their site.",1438608608

As a kid, time management is extremely different. You presumably had much more time and less options of things to pick from, so for the most part, video games may have taken up a large percentage of what you enjoyed, and even what you cared about.<p>As a kid, I would sit for hours playing the nes Zelda and repeatedly dying, picking up the controller, and having another go. But now, now if I even have time to play video games, I just want to sit down and play some mind-numbing, flashy video game to blow off some steam. After a day of work, I don&#x27;t want to continually be challenged and exert mental effort.<p>I just wish that both clever and mind-numbing games were still being built, but lately consumer trends have skewed towards the mind-numbing.. which I do believe is unfortunate for people with more time and interest in playing quality video games, namely the next generation of kids.",1438608549

At this stage they don&#x27;t need to know that a top level object has been implicitly created for them and this statement is part of that object.  We&#x27;ll get to that stuff later.

It&#x27;s a multidimensional integral equation. Unidirectional path tracing is an algorithm he introduced to solve the rendering equation. It uses several rays traced from pixels in the camera bouncing randomly through the scene.  It&#x27;s a Monte Carlo integration algorithm for solving the nasty integrals.<p>Photon mapping involves a pass algorithm tracing light from light sources into the scene, then a pass (like path tracing)  gathering that light back at the camera. It better handles more complex light effects like caustics.",1438608141

This could either happen due to language barrier, or due to lack of understanding of the users.<p>What I think is this - when they said &quot;Internet&quot;, 3-4% users understood that to be open Web, with browser, a .com and the whole package. They responded correctly that they don&#x27;t use it. But correctly identified that they spend time on Facebook. So in users&#x27; mind, they correctly distinguished open Web from the apps. However, they conflated the term internet with the web.<p>And a lot of people will make such distinction. If you don&#x27;t do any Web browsing but remained in contact with your family over Whatsapp, you will term it as, &quot;I was off the Web to save time, but I did use Whatsapp.&quot; That does not mean what this article concludes, that you don&#x27;t think that Whatsapp uses Internet.",1438607158

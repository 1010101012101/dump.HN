7285328,comment,7282005,7285299,4,0,sillysaurus3,,,"This isn&#x27;t a defense of Apple&#x27;s choices, but:<p>Using public implementations for crypto code has been difficult until pretty recently.  There didn&#x27;t exist many high-quality, trustworthy, public implementations of the types of crypto that real-world systems have wanted to do.<p>Even now, the situation is pretty grim for anyone who wants to integrate crypto code into an existing large codebase.  The canonical answer is &quot;just use NaCl.&quot;  However, I&#x27;ve had developers outright refuse to use NaCl because &quot;it&#x27;s so hard to compile.&quot;  They were saying NaCl has some issues compiling on certain types of architectures, and issues compiling as a dynamic library.  When libsodium was suggested in response, they retorted that libsodium was &quot;NaCl but with modifications by people other than the ones you&#x27;d want making modifications to crypto code.&quot;  In other words, libsodium purports to be &quot;NaCl, but easy to integrate into your project,&quot; yet the reason it&#x27;s easy to integrate is because someone other than recognized cryptography experts fiddled around with NaCl until it was easy to compile.  So apparently it&#x27;s an open question whether libsodium is as trustworthy as NaCl, and NaCl is a pain to integrate.<p>All of this implies that the current situation is <i>still</i> not very good as of 2014 for people who want to just do crypto safely and in some standard way.  And rather than writing that code in 2014, Apple had to write it years ago, when the situation was far more painful than the present day&#x27;s shortcomings.<p>To answer your question, yes, there are public implementations which could theoretically be used.  But actually using them is... difficult.  Not nearly as difficult or as error-prone as rolling your own, but perhaps difficult enough where someone who isn&#x27;t an expert in cryptography might make the dire mistake of believing that rolling their own is less difficult.<p>I wish Matasano would publish an open-source crypto library.  An &quot;NaCl that&#x27;s easy to use and that people actually trust.&quot;  They have the resources and the credit to pull it off.<p>Alternatively, I wish we could gather funds to have them audit libsodium.<p>Also, all of this is based on the assumption that NaCl or libsodium actually meet the needs of what Apple was trying to do with this crypto code.  It probably doesn&#x27;t, because NaCl / libsodium provides a complete replacement to the entire crypto stack of an application.  To take a wild guess, I&#x27;m thinking that Apple needs to implement / interact with some other kinds of crypto than what NaCl/libsodium provide.  For example, certificate validation.  So then you&#x27;d suggest &quot;use cryptlib!&quot; but this is hampered by the fact that in addition to all the previous considerations, cryptlib also isn&#x27;t free.",1393144124

The UI is terrible, and plenty of the statistics it shows appear to be broken in unfathomable ways.<p>Estimated audience sizes? Nonsense.<p>Suggested ranges for bids? Sometimes change by almost an order of magnitude between submitting the ad details and checking the dashboard a few minutes later.<p>Preview your ad as viewers will actually see it to make sure you&#x27;ve got the image size right? ::hilarious laughter::<p>Figures for click-through rates? I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d only want to pay for actual clicks to your site and not other things like people clicking like on your ad or your page. After all, someone liking an ad that will be gone tomorrow is surely worth as much to you as someone actually visiting your site.<p>What times will your ad run? We&#x27;ll assume you&#x27;re in the US even though you explicitly told us you&#x27;re in the UK. And then we&#x27;ll also price everything in dollars, so you pay a conversion fee on every bill. And no, you can&#x27;t change this once your account is set up.<p>Just set it up the same way as last time, we were satisfied with that? Sorry, the system has changed again and you have to start over.<p>Maybe we could use a third party ad manager to try to overcome some of these difficulties? Sure, but they&#x27;re all going to work a bit differently, and the options they present won&#x27;t match what you see on Facebook&#x27;s own ad management pages.<p>All of this is based on various experiences as a small business advertiser, and in most of the cases I&#x27;m thinking of the real numbers still worked out favourable despite all the problems and the frustration of trying to get everything working so the campaigns went ahead. But if Facebook treats larger customers spending serious money the same way, it&#x27;s not hard at all to see why we hear stories like this from time to time and why legal action can result.",1393144102

7285317,comment,7284099,7285027,7,0,comex,,,"Hold up.  Regardless of whether the media appreciates this point, a memory corruption bug in a relatively restricted (compared to the wealth of JavaScript) protocol like TLS has a decent chance of being very difficult to exploit reliably on modern systems, probably including the NSS bug you mentioned.  The NSA might be able to do it, but it&#x27;s not magic, and failure has some possibility (though low) of being detected; a bug like the current one, an exploit for which is basically 100% reliable if set up correctly and is probably less likely to be detected if not, is going to be a lot more appealing, and sniffing data rather than executing code is probably usually good enough for its purposes.  Many other adversaries won&#x27;t even try difficult exploits, but can easily set up this one now that it&#x27;s been disclosed.<p>Admittedly, the above leaves aside the elephant in the room - regular old browser bugs, which are vastly more common, more likely to be reliable, and for the aforementioned other adversaries, relatively easily leveraged with exploit kits.  As I assume you know, browser sandboxes provide protection against renderer bugs on MitMed or attacker-controlled origins being used to hijack a HTTPS site (and OS-level sandboxes protect non-browser SSL applications), but sandboxes get popped all the time and one of the two targets of this bug, iOS Safari, is single-process, so meh.<p>I agree the coverage of this bug is overblown (...depressingly, since that&#x27;s just saying that modern computing is drastically insecure); I strongly doubt it was introduced intentionally, or that the NSA, if it knew about it, was &quot;relying on&quot; it in the sense that the disclosure is a huge loss.  But it&#x27;s still a particularly good bug.",1393143871

For example, someone might simplify the code by removing the explicit comparisons with 0 that are unnecessary here, and then later someone else might &quot;fix&quot; an &quot;obvious bug&quot; by replacing the &quot;(err = x) || (err = y)&quot; construction with the common construction &quot;(err == x) || (err == y)&quot; that they assumed was intended, perhaps prompted by a compiler warning. Obviously they shouldn&#x27;t if they didn&#x27;t properly understand the code, but when has that ever been a reliable guarantee? :-)",1393142662

Code execution bugs obviously is game over for me. But now with everything in the cloud, an attacker could get all I&#x27;m afraid of losing by fucking with my SSL connections.

It is about having a limit on the range of salaries in the organization and the cleaners happen to have the lowest there. The idea is that the extra profits should be shared by all the employees and not collected by the top executives.<p>As to why they wouldn&#x27;t just leave, well let them. You could hire better faculty members and you will have a sparkly clean university that can attract better students. Your research/teaching statistics go up and you can pick more funding. At some point other universities will follow your example and administrator salaries will normalize.<p>Not going to happen though .... more likely they will outsource the cleaning so that the president can earn 10x the salary of the IT stuff. Then they will probably outsource IT as well ...",1393142431

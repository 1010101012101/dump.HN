9592920,comment,9590694,9592564,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"I think we&#x27;re talking about several different things here.  I&#x27;m asserting that there are five essential inputs to one&#x27;s economic outcome.  In no particular order, they are:<p>1. The activities in which one engages to obtain income.  This can be labor, crime, cheating and manipulation, employment of capital, or some combination of these.<p>2. Starting position: did you enter adulthood with an inheritance or trust fund?<p>3. Management: what do you do with the income you receive?<p>4. Environment: macroeconomic conditions and public policy (presently inseparable).<p>5. Luck, those arbitrary events that affect an individual or small group of people (as distinct from environmental factors that affect everyone).  These can be positive or negative.<p>Individuals generally can control (1) and (3), though the available options and their merits are products of external forces.  You seem hung up on the notion that these are the only two factors that matter.  You acknowledge (5) but assert that it&#x27;s ultimately irrelevant to outcomes.  You don&#x27;t seem to acknowledge (2) and (4) at all.<p>I am asserting that a high probability of good economic outcomes (i.e., financial independence) requires that at least (3), (4), and (5) all be favorable if we begin from the premise that the only sources of income and capital available are the proceeds of labor and one&#x27;s own accumulated capital.  That is, we&#x27;re not going to cheat or steal and we weren&#x27;t born into anything.<p>I am not asserting that good economic outcomes are <i>impossible</i> under other circumstances, only that they are highly <i>unlikely</i>.<p>It would be very useful to bring some data into this conversation.  I would like to compare the outcomes achieved by hypothetical pairs of individuals who satisfy our constraints on factors (1) and (2) and are identical in their luck (there are no material events) and management, but differ in environment.  For example, suppose that there are two individuals born 20 years apart, one in 1955 and the other in 1975.  Both are male Americans, both are employed in full-time, year-round work beginning at age 20, neither is ever unemployed for any reason, and both set aside some fraction of their age-appropriate median-wage income and invest it in one of a few simple ways (we can vary that fraction and how it&#x27;s invested).  Each pays the taxes he legally owes and no more, and for simplicity&#x27;s sake each is single and lives in a state with no personal income tax.  The object of this exercise?  To check in with each at age 40 and see, in today&#x27;s dollars, the purchasing power of their assets and the purchasing power of the income those assets produce.  We could then examine other splits; for example, two people born at the same time, one in Japan and the other in Switzerland.  Or fraternal twins, one male and the other female.  The possibilities are limited only by the availability of data.<p>It would be great to see such a study.  If anyone has done it, the results are not particularly easy to find.  Most of the data exists: historical tax laws from the Tax Policy Center, historical income data from the Census Bureau, deflators and unemployment data from the BLS, interest rate and bond market data from the Fed, and stock market prices and dividends from the exchanges and many other sources.  Some countries keep better records than others.  Having looked into what&#x27;s available, I think someone could put together something reasonable in a week or two.<p>According to your thesis, these studies will show that everyone will obtain approximately the same outcome, because in all cases we have controlled for luck, starting position, income, and management strategy.  Only the choice of management strategy will have material impact.<p>According to my thesis, these studies will reveal (a) that environmental factors dominate the outcomes, (b) that there are many environments in which there is no non-oracular management strategy that will yield an outcome as good as that achieved by a male American born in 1955 who employs a simple, moderately frugal management strategy, and (c) that the vast majority of environments that have existed over the past 20 years, including today&#x27;s, are strongly detrimental to positive outcomes.<p>I assert this despite the ultra-simplified deterministic model I propose to use.  I further assert that the stochastic injection of periods of unemployment (in accordance with actual historical rates) will radically worsen outcomes in at least 3 quintiles relative to the above-mentioned baseline.<p>Finally, I assert that these results are obvious.  I&#x27;m not exactly going out on a limb here.<p>I know I sound like a &quot;progressive&quot;.  I am not.  I do not advocate redistribution, higher minimum wages, more rent control, or a culture of victimhood.  Quite the opposite on all counts.  What I do advocate are changes to public policy that make it much less likely that decades of any individual&#x27;s working life will be lived in an environment that strongly penalizes the proceeds of labor and accumulated capital.  You should not attack me based on your preconceived ideas about &quot;what I want&quot;, from either the markets or public policy.<p>More directly to the point, my original assertion was that teaching a child that factor (3) is the only one of import does him a great disservice.  Prudent management of one&#x27;s finances is almost always necessary but almost never sufficient.  Acknowledging this is not casting blame but rather observing the world around us, thinking critically about how it works, and accepting it as it really is: healthy things for any child to do from an early age.",1432389478

Most discrimination is due to unconscious biases, both in our responsive to negotiation tactics from men v. women, and in our initial &quot;gut feeling&quot; about how valuable an employee someone will be. Humans aren&#x27;t rational logic machines, as much as we like to pretend we are.<p>> if it were an act of discrimination, every boss would have to be in on it a la Nash Equilibrium.<p>Prima facie, this seems like it should be true, but there&#x27;s also a positive correlation between height and income. The Nash Equilibrium hasn&#x27;t solved this. Why? Even if you have no answer, denying the fact because you can&#x27;t explain it isn&#x27;t a great option.<p>The usual explanation, which seems bared out by the data, is that subtle, unconscious bias (not explicit, conscious bias) is pervasive enough that in an imperfect market with transaction costs. If someone could choose to be immune to this bias, and thus be 100% non-discriminatory, that would be an advantage, but it&#x27;s not as simple as just choosing not to be biased, nor is it simple to then demonstrate that fact to the entire labor market.",1432389161
9592906,comment,9592642,9592871,0,0,mrdrozdov,,,"I&#x27;m not too sure. In my experience, salary negotiations will earn you a few percentage points at most. It does make it easier for a potential employee to decide between two companies (this is what the other company offered, can you match it?), but it&#x27;s a relatively small number compared to difference in promotion level and team. If we&#x27;re talking about software engineering, these positions tend to have 5 or so levels plus different teams. Salary is tied to team and level. I don&#x27;t think what Ellen is doing will directly make a huge impact on the gender gap because the problem in software engineering is more about underrepresentation of women.

Probably it would...<p>A study from 1992 on the effect of a minimum wage hike along the NJ/PA border found that there was not a significant impact from raising min wage.

Many folks point out the minimum wage is primarily intended for young people, but it&#x27;s not being used that way anymore. And, in fact, other places have adapted without terrible consequences. Australia, for instance, has a juvenile minimum wage around $6.60/hr (USD), which doubles for adults.<p>>  Are stock buy backs a good idea? ...down to what...is the best use of the shareholders money.<p>The point here is that McDonalds is making mutually exclusive arguments.

This added crimes to the list of when wiretapping may be done. It&#x27;s used to target journalists, activists, or anyone else who can be suspected of &quot;providing material support to terrorists&quot;.<p>Section 202 -- Wiretapping in computer fraud and abuse felony cases. Used to harass and intimidate whistleblowers, such as Drake.<p>Section 203(b) -- Sharing wiretap information. Enables parallel reconstruction and lets all federal agencies share in the surveillance.<p>Section 203(d) -- Sharing foreign intelligence information. Like the above section but lets intel be shared with local officials. This is how you end up with local police mining Facebook chats for Occupy Wallstreet plans.<p>Section 204 -- FISA pen register/trap and trace exceptions. Lets NSA tap into the internet backbone. Justification for implanting malware into Xcode, cell phones, routers, etc.<p>Section 206 -- FISA roving wiretaps. General search warrants for companies, facilities, etc (and their millions of customers/employees/students/users).<p>Section 209 -- Seizure of voicemail messages pursuant to warrants. Lets voicemail content be harvested as easily as e-mail and internet traffic.<p>Section 212 -- Emergency disclosure of electronic surveillance. Immunity to internet/phone companies for helping run the surveillance state.<p>Section 214 -- FISA pen register/trap and trace authority. Lets all internet, phone lines, and devices be tapped, including inside the US.<p>Section 215 -- FISA access to tangible items. Like the above section but compels companies to assist in the surveillance.<p>Section 217 -- Interception of computer trespasser communications. Like the above section but it explicitly authorizes collecting full content.<p>Section 218 -- Purpose for FISA orders. Declares every American subject to surveillance, whether for petty crime, serious crime, terrorism, pre-crime, or juicy gossip.<p>Section 220 -- Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence. Ensures that a few judges near D.C. can rubberstamp paperwork and have their orders apply anywhere in the country.<p>Section 223 -- Civil liability and discipline for privacy violations. This sections suggests that government liability for surveillance sunsets too.<p>Section 225 -- Provider immunity for FISA wiretap assistance. Immunity for all companies helping run the surveillance state.<p>...

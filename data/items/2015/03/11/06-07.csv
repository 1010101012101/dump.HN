Boys do manage a nice scream, but it doesn&#x27;t sound the same, especially past the age of 3.</i><p>I worked as a neurology technician for four years, doing tests on a patient load that was half paediatric, plenty of whom had an induced drowsy state to bring out epileptic activity. Drowsy kid, strange environment, strange person touching their head, and sometimes autistic. For four years, I spent half the day in the presence of children&#x27;s screams. I promise you that they don&#x27;t sound different, and <i>certainly</i> not to the qualitative level you&#x27;re trying to shoehorn in here.<p>And seriously, it&#x27;s not like the statement was a neutral explanation. It&#x27;s a trope - no-one says &quot;run away screaming like a little boy&quot;. Trying to defend it as a serious qualitative explanation of the actual sound made is nonsense.<p>> <i>A desire for equality will not be achieved by erasing all differences, but by celebrating all differences, and recognizing each is valuable in its own way.</i><p>I wholeheartedly agree - we need to recognise people as individuals and individual differences. Hence why we need to drop generalising tropes like &quot;run away screaming like a little girl&quot;, because they are about stereotypes, not individuality. There are plenty of girls out there who don&#x27;t do that - my mother&#x27;s earliest memory is of patting a hairy spider, for example.

We were basically building around having a daughter card handle decoding the video and handling the communication with Netflix servers since there just isn&#x27;t the memory (and probably not the real time horsepower) to do everything on main CPU.  The idea was that an rpi could prime the nametables and communicate via MMC3 style interrupts with the main board, but we wanted to make sure we resisted the temptation of other hacks and simply punch the HDMI jack out of the back of the device and run everything through a primed emulator.  We set the rules at &quot;real hardware&quot; and trying to keep true to what you could ship in a cart (though possibly a big one) that a user could put in and play.<p>Sadly, we had to cut the rpi this time due to time constraints.  So we set the data up as if that was doing its job and focused on the current rendering issues and understanding the NES side of things.  Hardware interfaces aside (I&#x27;m no wiz there), the rpi parts and encoding magic should have been fairly trivial.  In the end, we had plenty of CPU cycles left during playback which leave me pretty confident on the rest.<p>That&#x27;s not to say we wouldn&#x27;t have run into some sort of problems with keeping the PPU primed, but we can save that for another (hack?) day.",1426056251

While it doesn&#x27;t quite support SQL transactions, it is durable.  The data is journaled before being confirmed, and once confirmed will be written to disk.  It can be consistent, but this sort of breaks the whole idea of scaling and distributing the load in Mongo, or causes massive performance problems, so that is something to consider when using it. Understanding and adopting eventual consistency is tough, but it&#x27;s an issue with every distributed database, not just MongoDB.<p>And you don&#x27;t &quot;keep your entire data set in memory&quot;.  You should make sure your <i>indexes</i> fit in memory. Your data can be as large as you like.  Most people with terabytes of data in MongoDB don&#x27;t keep terabytes of RAM in their servers.<p>Foursquare did NOT keep every single check-in in RAM. They kept an index of them in RAM, sure. But the problem was they had a sharded MongoDB deployment and one of the shards became unbalanced and exceeded the available RAM.  If that happens (harder to do these days, but not impossible), it can be very difficult to recover.<p>MongoDB tries to bridge that gap between NoSQL and SQL. I think the MongoDB folks originally ignored decades of database research when developing MongoDB, but they&#x27;ve been forced to adopt it as the years have passed. Is it an Oracle killer? No.  But it can be a useful and productive tool if you understand and apply it appropriately.",1426053993

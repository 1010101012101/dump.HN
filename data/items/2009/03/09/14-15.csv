But I just wanted to say that had he started with this level of analysis, he might not have gotten so many down mods or at least got his more serious points noticed.  Studies on recidivism rates are very relevant to this discussion, and it is disappointing that citations to serious studies about it are now grayed out and buried deep in a comment thread.  It would be useful for the debate to have some arguments in favor of keeping drugs illegal that include empirical data, and I think newt0311 could have contributed some of that,  had he not led with the ""kill all the drug users"" opinion.<p>To respond to you, the idea that the solution to the drug problem is the same as the solution to crappy writing is interesting.

508454,comment,508238,508335,0,0,mbreese,,,"This is much lower level and doesn't require javascript to work.  (Ignoring the fact that the demo is an in-browser javascript http server).  So, it's not comet.<p>The problem is that this isn't supported by any clients that are in wide-spread use, so you can't just load up a webpage and see a demo.<p>The advantage of this type of approach only becomes clear when you are using a lower-level http client library to access resources.  It gives the server a chance to poll the client for information, without using Javascript.  For browser approaches, this may not matter.  However, for lower-infrastructure things, this approach is great.<p>I've used a very similar technique to link compute nodes to a job server where the compute nodes were behind a NAT.  This eliminated any long polling required and still allowed the server to query the nodes for their status.<p>Again, not the type of thing where you're running anything in a browser, but I wanted to use HTTP as the protocol for simplicity, and needed a way for the server to talk to a client behind a NAT.<p>Now the down side is that you basically have to rewrite a web server in order for this to work.  I'm not sure if this could be bolted on.  You also need some sort of session management built in, so you can pair incoming (client->server) requests and outgoing (server->client) requests.  And then you need a client library that can spin up it's own http server and handle it's own requests.<p>In my case, I was able to write everything from scratch.  But I doubt my code would scale very well.  I'm also not sure that in this case it isn't better to just make a new protocol.  There is a lot of hackery required to get this to work, and I doubt you'll see web browsers support anything like this.",1236610180

508450,comment,507959,508201,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"You're correct in the sense that eventually train security will approach airline security and take just as long, but trains still have the advantage of being able to load and unload faster (there are more doors and they are generally more spacious) and baggage doesn't have to be handled by a crew... each passenger can carry on his own bags and stow them.<p>Also, once you are on a train, the crew doesn't have to spend as much time doing pre-departure stuff like checking seatbacks/belts/tray tables and running through the safety instructions that no one listens to.<p>Lastly, they have a slight advantage (when run well) of being pretty darn consistent on departure and arrival times, meaning riders don't have to leave as much fudge time. In my experience, if you only have a carry-on, you can catch a plane by showing up an hour early, but you can catch a train by showing up 30 mins early (I'm thinking of the Eurostar, where security is similar to an airport).<p>Personally I think <i>the</i> big advantage is passenger comfort. The comfort level of a high speed train, even in 2nd class, is better than first class on a plane. There is more space, you can stand/sit/walk at will, and there is actually something to look at besides a white ocean of clouds. Not to mention the bathrooms aren't the size of high school lockers.",1236609985

Check-in, security checkpoints, and boarding 300 people through one tiny door are all exclusive to air travel.  When you take the train, you buy your ticket from a machine, put it in a turnstile to access the platform, and then wait until your train pulls in.  Then you board through one of the 20-or-so doors that is closest to your seat.  It's really that simple, and it has been that way for years.<p>Remember, America is almost 45 years behind the rest of the world here.

However, its not clear at all if related crime and accidents would go up.  Looking to the example of alcohol prohibition, crime went sharply down when it was re-legalized.  Many people die as a result of alcohol use while driving every year, so it seems possible that accidents from driving on drugs would increase with legalization.

508440,comment,507358,508332,0,0,seertaak,,,"Musicians don't think the world owes them a living. In fact I can scarcely think of an endeavour which requires more individuality and self-reliance than music. Your callousness (""they should get another job instead"") and propensity to attribute sloth and recidivism to us, when all we're asking for is that people pay a fair price to listen to the music they love, is unseemly and saddening.<p>As for your facile lecture in economic theory: the problem, quite simply, is that people ""aren't prepared to pay enough money"" because they've grown accustomed to acquiring their music through illegal means (partly, admittedly, as a result of missteps from the industry itself). By your argument, whenever we encounter a situation where the technology is such that copying can occur at zero-cost, we should just throw are hands in the air and say ""that's it, there's nothing we can do: economic theory dictates that this has no value"".<p>By that argument, Microsoft Windows or Office has no value; its price should be zero. There should not, in fact, exist software whose price is non-zero. Movies, too, should not cost anything. They should be given away for free in stores, because you can copy them too.<p>But why stop there? Why enforce property rights at all? After all, it requires a massive investment in the form of a police force to stop or dissuade me, for example, from burgling your home. Stopping property theft requires political will. Intellectual property enforcement is different in practice but not in principle. The goal has to be to raise the cost of downloading music illegally until the majority cease to do so and purchase it through legal means.<p>In the final instance, if a potential customer thinks the prices charged for CDs are excessive, he/she has the right not to listen to them. But if he/she chooses to listen, then damn straight they'd better pay the asking price! -- as I mention above, massive amounts of effort, blood, sweat, and love went into creating it. It is right and proper that that work be rewarded.<p>In conclusion, the public should pay for albums, not because he/she ""owes it"" to the musician, because by not doing so (and still listening to the album, as several people on this thread have advocated), you're taking away the freedom of the musician to set the price of <i>his/her</i> music as he/she sees fit.<p>It's as if you ran into a Luis Vuitton store with a gun and said: ""Your prices are too high! Give me that handbag for free!"" Nobody in their right mind would defend that behaviour, even if there's general agreement that said handbags are over-priced. The reason is that it is Luis Vuitton's right, as the maker of the handbags, to determine what the price for them is; not yours as a consumer to demand a certain price and steal it if you don't get that price.<p>Again: we're saying: ""I think this CD is worth 8 pounds. If you want to listen to it, pay me that amount. If not, then don't listen to it"".<p>There are many ways of obtaining music legally now. I live in the UK, and pay ten pounds a month to use Spotify (which I heartily recommend, it's an awesome program and works even works on Linux with wine), and I pay another ten pounds to use napster.co.uk (which lets me listen to their <i>entire</i> catalogue from my browser). Or I can get the music through iTunes. Or amazonmp3. Or if I'm a hi-fi purist, I can buy the CD.<p>If you're too cheap to pay 10 pounds a month to have legal access to a massive catalogue of music, then just admit it -- spare us musicians your hypocritical self-righteousness. You basically admit you steal music, and then you have the gall to lecture us about ""owing us a living"".

In the end, you bear more responsibility (and bear all of the consequences).  But that does not make the tobacco industry morally neutral or good, in my opinion.",1236608320

I'm working on a JavaScript web application that communicates with a Common Lisp backend using S-expressions one way and JSON the other way (for good enough reasons).<p>I devised a neat scheme with nested alists and wrote a poorly-specified, bug-ridden implementation of half of Common Lisp in JavaScript to make sense of it all.  Then I got really confused for a couple of weeks until I finally figured out why it was so hard to get right.<p>JavaScript doesn't have a cons or pair type.  There's just no way to get cdr and cons to work sanely without being able to juggle Arrays' individual conses.  Adding a class for such a fundamental unit and implementing my own linked lists with that would bog everything down just a bit too much.  So the house of cards collapsed.<p>In hindsight it's obvious, but I spent a lot of time wondering why the whole thing was so confusing.",1236607825

You are a good programmer because you are a good programmer. It's a combination of traits that the individual aquires during all the points in life before the one in which we declare him a ""good programmer"". For every self-thought good programmer, you can name one with a degree. And vice versa.<p>The point of this article is not the way you learn to program. The point is how the company attracted someone and inspired him to fullfill his potential, and in the end be a true asset to the company.

""That means a hundred million potential customers"" for electric cars.<p>That's the kind of absurd and ill-informed thinking that brought GM to bankruptcy (and yes, this guy is a former GM employee). I moved to China a month ago, and I was astonished to see the number of e-bikes here. There are a lot of cars too, but they are clearly not practical. While US is designed for cars (highways, suburbia life, big stores with parking, etc...) in China owning a car seems extremely inconvenient: No places to park, horrendous traffic jams, stress, narrow streets, not even mentioning the cost of the car itself and maintenance.<p>In the city I live (Shenyang) a bus ride is 1 yuan (US$0.14). A taxi ride is between 8 to 20 yuan (US$3). Plenty of streets have bike lanes and every store has free bike / e-bike parking. The ROI in owning a car must be ridiculous, and it is very inconvenient.<p>To believe that every e-bike owner one day will be a electric car owner is totally naive IMO.",1247939047

For example: client certs, tokens, OTP systems, old-fashioned HTTP-auth, etc. For that matter, you could require the use of more than one IdP!

On the other hand, it&#x27;s worth noting that I probably saved us a whole 5-10 minutes on each coordinated coffee trip at the cost of hours and hours of (admittedly extra-curricular -- much like a current project I own at Netflix, at the time Caffeinator was explicitly not what I was getting paid to work on) work.  It&#x27;s quite likely I could have invested some of that time in other projects I was just as passionate about which may have been more relevant to the business (but, well, I didn&#x27;t and I&#x27;m OK with that).<p>That said, I&#x27;d argue the debt tracking system built into Caffeinator was a totally unnecessary bolt-on that made it unnecessarily complex.

We enjoyed competing with each other in learning math, but it resulted in us going into 6th grade knowing everything we would be learning for the next three years. In Math alone. We were falling asleep in class, waking up at the end, and getting perfect-score-plus-bonus on every daily quiz.<p>We made the choice (not our parents, mind you) to try and skip a grade in Math alone. The school fought against us in this, and we eventually broke through, skipping two grades in math. Because our middle and high schools were next door to each other, we could walk across the street to take more advanced classes. The only downside was that I ran out of Math classes to take after my Sophomore year.<p>This isn&#x27;t a brag. Far from it. <i>All that this did was bring us into the level of math we were already prepared for</i>, and which some private schools or wealthier schools already teach at that age-level, without skipping grades. I am grateful for the opportunity to not sit on my hands for two additional years, and to not be artificially disadvantaged by a system that moves too slow for the current standards of college preparation.<p>I have bumped up against the &quot;Curse of the Gifted&quot; in several places in life. I suspect I am hitting one right now in some aspects of how I produce software. But skipping two grades in lower-level Math was not one of them. In fact, it is now standard at my middle and high school, among the top students, to simply skip ahead at least one year in math.

I can&#x27;t speak definitively for the movement at the time, but my mother was absolutely aware of MTFs and was fully supportive.  She was aware of MTFs because of women&#x27;s studies classes, and her definition of feminism came from those same classes.  So there was at least a sizable feminist subset that subscribed to that definition.  Frustratingly, FTMs still weren&#x27;t widely acknowledged, and while she was supportive she chalked what I said about myself up to being a tom-boy, while trying to stay open to the possibility that there could be FTMs.",1392157880

7220967,comment,7219872,7219872,26,0,bane,,,"<i>edit</i> a little stream of consciousness follows<p>Curse of being gifted is <i>very</i> real. I wonder sometimes how many people couldn&#x27;t break out of it and have ended up in bad jobs, or worse.<p>Probably like many HNers I also suffered from it mightily in K-12 and by the time I realized what was going on, I was already so far behind that escaping school, rather than redoing years of what I missed, was the easier option.<p>It took me a few years of milling around before I finally got my head together the right way and turned my life around into something productive.<p>One thing that still comes up to this day for me is a profound sense of isolation and loneliness. It&#x27;s hard to relate to people because the kinds of problems most people have seem trivially simple to me and are not the kinds of problems I have and the kinds of things people want to talk about are not of interest to me. I try to stay intellectually engaged by turning the issue into one of how to communicate with people who aren&#x27;t as quick as I? Adult education, how people learn, are a small hobby of mine. I even did a short stint as a teacher.<p>I&#x27;m consumed with relationships with mapping out the other person&#x27;s cognitive limitations and patterns and trying to work within and around those. This is not a good habit, but I find I end up doing it with most everybody. The people I tend to keep around me are those that I haven&#x27;t been able to conclusively do this with. I guess they keep me interested? I&#x27;m rarely surprised by people.<p>I remember I mentioned this to an associate one time. He asked me if I had done this with him. I answered yes. He challenged me to prove it. I went down a list of his cognitive biases, how they fed into his decision making process, and how this created a pattern of where I could even start inventorying what I thought he had in his apartment (I&#x27;d never been to his apartment). I missed the color of his couch, but guessed correctly where he bought his furniture, what kind of car he drove and was likely to buy and why, what TV shows he watched, what music he listened to (and had listened to in the past), the clothes he did and didn&#x27;t have in his closet, what kind of food he liked and where he liked to shop, I picked his neighborhood, choice of home computer, where he wanted to retire and even a handful of books he probably had in his home library. I think it hurt him, or his sense of individuality, to be deconstructed like that. It was the last time I ever did this to another person. On the flip side, he tries to mix his life up, make random vectors in his life now and not be so predictable. But I know also that he does it because of what I did. It&#x27;s just another behavior to slot into his patterns.<p>Relating to people impacts me in many ways, from coming up with product ideas to finding a mentor, to the closeness of friends. It&#x27;s tough, I have very few close friends but I hold onto them fiercely. With most people I interact with I feel like we&#x27;re simply in a status of mutual understanding and shared purpose, but not friendship. Maybe out for some laughs and a good time, but that&#x27;s it.<p>I got very lucky and found a wife who&#x27;s smarter than me, and she keeps me on my toes and from drawing the world down into my brain and further isolating myself with walls of internally consistent, but bad ideas. I&#x27;ve never figured out how to predict her thinking process beyond some high level abstract patterns. I think she does it on purpose, to keep me appreciative of her.<p>Not having a mentor has probably been the hardest. I feel like I have nobody helping me find my path most of the time and have to literally carve a path in the universe for myself. My parents were simply not equipped to deal with a kid like me at all and made many mistakes over the years. From moving to the country (thinking the quiet would help me grow, when it just isolated me more) to schooling choices, etc. School didn&#x27;t know how to handle me and in business I&#x27;ve found woefully few people I look up to.<p>I yearn for a simpler life, but realize I couldn&#x27;t live that life for long, I would quickly lose interest. I start to crave novelty and surprise. New things are interesting to me. But I&#x27;ve also found that once I start to understand the pattern of newness in something, an entire field will start to bore me.<p>Actually most of the life skills I have I learned from my school&#x27;s music program. How to break a problem down, how to communicate with people of various levels, how to tutor and teach, how to lead a group and present, setting and keeping schedules etc. Most of my adult years have been spent trying to adapt these skills from orchestra into the rest of my life, while most people would have learned them in more context appropriate ways.<p>But I guess I turned out okay. I do not look back on most of my childhood with much fondness, I do look back on it with a great deal of sadness and regret and wish I could redo it all. I found out a few years ago that my mother had saved all of my report cards growing up, lovingly stored in a scrapbook. When I found out she had done this, in a fit of anger, resentment and deep embarrassment I tore them up and threw them away.<p>There&#x27;s no solution, it just is this way. I live a very fulfilling life that I enjoy and I try to minimize regrets and find joy. I think I&#x27;m on a path towards simplifying my life, but I have a notion that I&#x27;ll find a more minimal life dreadful and boring after a few months.<p>I <i>do</i> seek out others who I sense have a similar story, but I find that none of us ever really build close bonds with each other. We exist more in a group of mutual acknowledgment than in friendship. I&#x27;m drawn towards groups that promise an intelligent gathering, but I&#x27;m frequently disappointed by what I find once I get there.<p>My mother once asked me why so many smart kids end up in drugs and drink, I responded that, at least for me, it slows the thinking down and clarifies the thoughts. It&#x27;s like having an engine in your car that&#x27;s always at full rev, and then finally taking your foot off the accelerator for a bit. It also lets the emotions flow a bit easier, the ones that we have to keep bottled up during the day, the slow accumulation of small frustrations from dealing with people who I can&#x27;t relate to. It&#x27;s like a sore I can pop and let the puss flow out for a bit.<p>It&#x27;s hard staying positive, not falling into hopelessness and depression. I&#x27;ve had very close scares a couple times where I thought about disengaging from everything and ending it. Feeling like you&#x27;re in the wrong world all the time is maddening. I found a way to continue on, and it works for me. But that endless well of despair still sits there, but it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m walking around the edge of it, like walking around the edge of a swimming pool, trying to make sure I don&#x27;t fall or jump in.",1392157754

I might have a record that has a new field added. Now it&#x27;s not necessarily pretty to upgrade on call with a pattern match or using a code upgrade protocol but it&#x27;s easily expressed dynamically.<p>Another is in the interface, like adding new arguments or changing from a synchronous call to an asynchronous one. These are a bit easier to handle via indirection though they show that you&#x27;ll need to plan your entry/exit points for upgrades carefully (again, OTP has things like gen_server which make this much easier).<p>If Haskell can manage to get past they type boundary issue then it&#x27;s really a matter of supporting at least 2 simultaneous versions of code so each process can be scheduled and upgraded in natural course. Handling more than 2 could be of use depending on how aggressively you want to purge, for example, a local rather than fully qualified call can be caught in a closure and passed around as in some value to be called later.

Because with generics and exceptions you can actually wrap the whole result in an algebraic data-type that also has handy methods for dealing with failure (e.g. a monad), as in:<p><pre><code>    Try(executeWithRetries(5)(funcMayErr)).map(x => x + 1).getOrElse(default)\n</code></pre>\nCheers,",1392156352

7220804,comment,7217284,7220058,3,0,Crito,,,"We shouldn&#x27;t give a shit about current drug dealers.  The idea is to allow other people to provide a safe and consistent product out in the open, out-competing traditional drug dealers.  These drug dealers will no longer have the opportunity to exploit children as street-level pushers, those children will get thrown into the legal system realistically erasing all job prospects.  Legalized possession of drugs will keep even more innocents out of the legal system, and furthermore will remove many of the tools that police have traditionally used to justify violating people&#x27;s right.  <i>&quot;I smelled weed&quot;</i> will no longer be an excuse that police can use to frisk any minority they please.<p>> <i>&quot;Also the more complexity that goes into &quot;appropriate&quot; regulation, the more likely that specific (ie used by the upper classes) drugs will be the only ones that get deillegalized. Which will fail to address the actual problem at all.&quot;</i><p>The entire class of <i>&quot;we&#x27;re only legalizing &#x27;upper class&#x27; drugs&quot;</i> arguments are complete nonsense.  The fact is that disadvantaged minorities are <i>massively</i> over-represented in marijuana arrests, despite using marijuana at similar rates as white americans.<p>> <i>&quot;But promoting it as an integral part of the solution helps perpetuate the same tired government-should-be-involved thinking that caused the problem in the first place.&quot;</i><p>We&#x27;ve got bigger fish to fry.  Drug laws are modern Jim Crow laws, concerns about the merits of taxing vices and luxuries have a lower priority.",1392156135

The guess is reasonable because from what FG claims, they put much resources on the OS development, thus, for a small startup, it is impossible for them to develop the motherboard and the whole industry design (even they have the ability to hand build a prototype).",1260554359

990099,comment,989539,989901,0,0,grellas,,,"The legal risks of a binding contract being formed merely because parties have exploratory discussions are pretty minimal.<p>To have a binding contract, even a verbal one, you need to have a meeting of the minds on terms of a deal that typically include mutual consideration - if what you are discussing is preliminary and does not include commitments upon which people can reasonably rely, it usually is safe to conclude that there is no basis for a binding contract.<p>The ""false promise"" type of situation is a specialized one that normally does not arise in most startup situations. In general, it is a variation of fraud. Fraud generally consists of false representations made to a party upon which that party reasonably relies to his detriment - in other words, getting ""tricked,"" misled, etc. in a way that hurts you. A typical misrepresentation must be one of a fact that is falsely represented by a party (e.g., ""my company has achieved x sales and you should invest in it when sales are nowhere near what is represented). The ""false promise"" variation of fraud is one in which the misrepresentation consists of a false fact but the fact itself is intangible - in this case, a false representation of one's state of mind. Thus, if one makes a promise without any intention of ever performing it, this is in the nature of a false statement of fact by which one can ""trick"" another person and thus constitutes a basis for fraud (e.g., if you do x, y, and z for my company, I will grant you a 20% interest in my company where the person making the promise never had any intention of performing on that promise). This ""false promise"" type of fraud is not the type of promise upon which a contract is formed but rather one upon which an action for fraud is predicated. In the contract context, it is most often used to try to get out of a contract (""I know my contract says I must do x, but the only reason I entered into it was in reliance on a promise made by the other party that he never intended to perform - because of the promissory fraud, I can rescind my contract"").<p>With respect to promises or exchanges upon which parties try to claim that a partnership has resulted, you need the essential element that any such venture has to be based on the idea of <i>splitting or sharing profits arising from your joint activity</i> in some fashion (almost always in some percentage fashion). Thus, this represents only a narrow category of situations where one might inadvertently find himself faced with a claim by another party that negotiations they engaged in allegedly resulted in a legal partnership between them.<p>As appears in the TC case, the ""false promise"" and ""binding partnership"" type of claims tend to arise when parties have had complex dealings between them, allowing one or more of the parties to assert colorable claims of having been misled to one's detriment or of claiming that the parties agreed to undertake a venture by which they would split profits.<p>In 99.99% of cases, you can safely undertake typical negotiations with another party without fear that you will inadvertently enter into a contract. This is one aspect of law in which, surprisingly, common sense is actually your best guide. Contracts ultimately tend to turn on reasonable expectations of the parties and, if what you are doing does not feel like a binding commitment, it usually is not.",1260554091

How will SQL deal with low-level semantics that do not provide transactions in the way SQL-users understand them but requires the user to understand the concepts of the CAP principle?  How well does SQL deal with conflicting data being returned from retrieval operation?  If SQL is being used as nothing more than a small set of verbs (a la memcache) then why bother?<p>I certainly hope that document-store developers do not take the lazy route and prematurely converge on a standard like SQL.  Fortunately it seems that few of them are particularly interested in this route and the more likely path seems to be providing multiple interfaces with RESTful HTTP, memcache, and a programmable/functional interface using JavaScript and/or the language the DB is coded in (Erlang and Java primarily.)

990020,comment,988585,989219,0,0,dkarl,,,"It isn't really true that programming is ""de-skilled.""  Entry-level programming may require nothing more than cleverness and knowledge of a language, but most programming jobs have an element of engineering to them.  Not only that, programmers in many jobs have surprising latitude to design user interfaces, information architectures, and other elements that really ""should"" be left to experts, but which are left to programmers by the same mechanism -- underestimation of the task and underestimation of the influence of individual performance -- that created opportunities for women to program in the first place.  Especially at a small startup, ""mere"" programmers are left to decide for themselves things that aren't considered vital enough for the ""leaders"" to pay attention to.  And you know <i>some</i> of those things will end up being more vital than anyone expected.<p>I think it would be more accurate to say that programming has been ""de-institutionalized.""  By and large, programmers learn their craft outside of formal schools and training programs.  In fact, it's very hard to get into programming through formal education (see my comment here:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=971157"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=971157</a>) without also following the now-traditional way of hobby programming as well.  So the selection process for becoming a programmer is not one that confers prestige.  Being a Stanford graduate confers prestige.  Being a better and more desired programmer than a Stanford CS graduate confers no prestige whatsoever except in the eyes of other programmers.<p>People in fields where degrees are important, and where colleges are the gatekeepers, are seen as more well-rounded and more generally intelligent than people in fields where long private pursuit is more important than a degree.  The fact that programming is within the grasp of any kid whose parents buy him a computer diminishes it in society's eyes.<p>I think it also diminishes the career in women's eyes.  The university-controlled career path in, say, chemistry, provides a built-in work-life balance and a shared experience with people in other fields.  In programming, the coding virtuosity acquired by hours and hours of practice is overvalued and is often confused, especially by other programmers, with a programmer's overall ability.  Yet this time is not officially recognized by educators and professionals.  It is not discussed or accommodated.  Musicians and athletes are expected to spend long hours practicing, but CS programs have no concept of programming ""practice"" in the sense of hours spent repetitively honing a skill.  Programmers must sacrifice other parts of their lives in order to acquire this practice, and most who enter the field are happy to do so.  Women feel like they can't compete unless they make the same sacrifices, and naturally, they don't like a field with a built-in bias against people who aren't obsessive.<p>(In programming, that bias is obvious from the start.  In academic research science, the bias emerges in graduate school and in the slog for tenure.  Elizabeth Blackburn, who just won a Nobel Prize in medicine, said, ""But many women, at the stage when they have done their training really want to think about family . . . and they just are very daunted by the career structure. Not by the science, in which they are doing really well.""  Blackburn's point is as valid in programming as it is in science:  obsessiveness and exclusive dedication may be helpful and may be a common element in mythologies about great scientists, but it is far from a requirement for making outstanding contributions, and we lose a lot of talent by filtering out (intentionally or unintentionally) people who don't want to dedicate the whole of their being to their career.)<p>In the time since I made the post linked above, I've been thinking about how to ameliorate this bias towards obsessiveness and the resulting distortion and loss of talent.  I'm encouraged by the hours of repetitive practice that are taken for granted in music and athletics.  I think programming could be made much more friendly to women by simply recognizing the importance of ""practicing"" programming in the same way that musicians practice.  It is understood that a significant amount of a musician's time and effort must be dedicated to practice, and that this practice time must be balanced against instruction and theoretical study.  Music buildings are full of practice rooms.  The hours that a budding programmer spends coding should be recognized and labeled as <i>practice</i>.  The time dedicated to it should be acknowledged.  Computer science professors -- who certainly <i>know</i> better -- should stop pretending that their classroom curriculum is sufficient to produce skilled graduates.<p>If the time spent practicing programming is acknowledged and accommodated the same way musical practice is, I think women (and, not insignificantly, men as well) will see software as profession where one can excel and also have a reasonable, balanced life.",1260551512

3170816,comment,3166137,3169948,1,0,jhuni,,,"<i>> And on top of that they were pretty much the only search engine for the web for a long time, so much so that ""google"" has become synonymous with internet for the average user.</i><p>There are a variety of industries which can be classified as natural monopolies [1], examples of this include public utilities like water services, electricity, and telecommunications. It is too expensive for a competitor to arise in these industries, so it is most efficient to have a central distributor. I believe that utility computing is another example of this, which justifies Google's status. You also mentioned ""all the flak they are getting,"" could you provide specifics?<p><i>> Because control of your computer includes control over your data.</i><p>I have complete control over my data, because I use entirely open systems based upon Linux, and in order to communicate my data over the internet I host my own personal server. At the same time, I am glad to have access to intelligent services provided by google, such as search and machine translation. These are helpful services, they don't hinder me in anyway.<p>On the other hand, if I choose to use Apple software, such as their iOS, I am entirely dependent upon Apple's every whim, and I am providing Apple with the opportunity to delete any of personal data. Similarily, if I host all of my personal data on external servers out of my control, like the ones controlled by Facebook, I will be just as disempowered. On the other hand, accepting assistance from intelligent services such as Google search is not a cause of any problems.<p><i>> And at last Apple's goal is to deliver easily usable, reliable and sexy hardware and software</i><p>Sure they create ""sexy"" products, but they present their sexy exterior to hide that they are doing evil things like restricting users with DRM. It would be totally ridiculous to have a motto like ""do no evil.""<p><i>> Again, you are mis-using words. Tyranny means they are alone and have all the control and are enforcing it brutally...</i><p>Apple does exert significant control over its subject computers through DRM [2], restrictive licensing [3], etc. I wouldn't necessarily say they enforce these restrictions ""brutally."" My use of the term tyranny to describe to describe Apple is partially inspired by the article On the Still-Undefeated Tyranny of Apple [4].<p><i>> There are lots of alternatives and on top of that</i><p>Could you show me what alternatives you are referring to? Are any of them free software? Do you think iTunes is acceptable just because there are some ""alternatives"" that are accepted well others, such as PyMusique, are unfairly shut down?<p><i>> And by doing this, they have shown how successful this way of distributing is thus finally they were allowed to drop the DRM.</i><p>Apple still uses DRM extensively today [2], even after they opened up their music player.<p><i>> Nothing was stolen here.</i><p>Which is why, if you look back I put a question mark after the term steal. I recognize that it is questionable what you might even qualify as stealing. The fact is Apple has a long history of taking other innovations from external sources (Xerox PARC, BSD, etc) and then being the ones to successfully market them. The real talent Apple has is for marketing and profiteering, not innovating.<p><i>> you make your own product choice and your own personal preferences to be something like a categorical imperative that you want to force on everyone despite the normative power of the factual.</i><p>Hang on there, I just a poor man, I can't force my ideas on anyone. The only thing I am advocating for here is to provide people with the freedom from being forced into things by big corporations like Apple and Microsoft.<p>You can get freedom from corporate forces by using free software operating systems, using Linux distributions such as Ubuntu or Android distributions such as Replicant.<p><i>> And I dare you, you show me a single contribution you have ever made to Linux? Or free software?</i><p>Yes, I have contributed to free software projects (e.g JSAN) but not as much as I would like to unfortunately, but I am still young, so I think still have time to do more. Check out my accounts on launchpad, github, etc.<p><a href=""https://launchpad.net/~jhuni-x"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchpad.net/~jhuni-x</a><p><i>> See, here is the point: that is your borderline-religious opinion. Nobody really cares about this.</i><p>Plenty of people care about these, especially people and governments outside the U.S that don't want to be dependent upon American companies. [5] [6]<p><i>> there is absolutely no DRM on my Mac keeping me from doing whatever I want.</i><p>You blame me of being a ""fandroid"" for my support of Google's AI projects. Yet you a clearly a huge fan of Apple yourself considering that you claimed that their products are ""sexy"" and that they contain ""absolutely no DRM.""

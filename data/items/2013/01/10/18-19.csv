5038963,comment,5037904,5038462,1,0,trotsky,,,"zero day means it was first seen in the wild (ie, they just found out about it very recently as well). It takes more than a day or two for even some of the most efficient organizations to find, fix, test and deploy even a critical vulnerability, especially when said organization supports hundreds of different permutations of architecture/os/major level/minor level etc. etc. And oracle is far from the most efficient of organizations.<p>The reason you normally see fixes deployed when you hear about the bug is because of ""responsible disclosure"" - details are held until a fix is ready. Those suggesting that oracle won't fix this outside of their normal quarterly patch cycle are off the mark though, surely there will be a (relatively) quick response from them (within a week or two would be my bet).",1357844354

Times article that opens the thread here notes with regret that the New York Times report<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/health/americans-under-50-fare-poorly-on-health-measures-new-report-says.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/health/americans-under-50-...</a><p>on the same report provides more detail. The lede paragraph shows the importance of cultural and lifestyle factors rather than health-care-as-such in the mortality and morbidity outcomes:<p>""Younger Americans die earlier and live in poorer health than their counterparts in other developed countries, with far higher rates of death from guns, car accidents and drug addiction, according to a new analysis of health and longevity in the United States.""<p>Drug addiction in particular is a severe problem in the United States to a degree not seen in (for example) east Asia. The stark historical memory of the Opium Wars imposing Western drug-pushing on east Asian populations makes many countries on the other side of the Pacific Rim very wary of letting young people start drug use. Illicit drugs were all but unknown in the childhood experience of my wife under Taiwan's former military dictatorship. Growing up free of harmful psychoactive substances allows young people clear heads to learn a lot (including learning other languages for international understanding) and to grow up to promote social improvements, such as the steady democratization and upgrades in provision of health care in Taiwan during my adult life.<p>So let's be clear what the report tells us: health outcomes in the United States often fare poorly compared to the health outcomes in other countries approximately as rich. But the challenges to health in the United States sometimes differ in ways that reflect long-standing differences in United States culture that still need to be nudged in healthier directions.<p>AFTER EDIT: There has been some hand-waving (without specific deep links) about OECD health statistics in this thread. In fact, the United States does not fare as badly in comparison to other OECD countries<p><a href=""http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2011-en/12/01/01/12-01-01-g1.html?contentType=&itemId=/content/chapter/factbook-2011-104-en&containerItemId=/content/serial/18147364&accessItemIds=&mimeType=text/html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2011-en/12/01/01...</a><p>as some of the statements in this thread have suggested.

Is it possible to feed my curiosity and supply queries/sec? :)<p>> ... any simpleton can make it so that all you see is a single include, but that doesn't stop the fact that you must still manually include each and every other file -- at some point in the framework -- before you can use it.<p>No, you only need to include the files you actually use. When you use them.<p>There's a strong argument to be had for being explicit, especially once performance becomes a concern.<p>The thread here is about arguing for autoload on performance grounds, and my opposition to such.<p>> pretty much every modern framework uses autoloading.<p>Pretty much every framework is crap, and a very bad way to build larger, complex systems, and maintain them over time. The majority of them are CMS and conventional website oriented, and apply poorly to other use cases. But you are perfectly welcome to limit your perceptions based upon what you consider to be modern and popular frameworks if you wish; it's entirely possible that - as I suspect - my experiences going beyond the above are a bit abnormal.<p>> Removing include calls does not make the code more complex nor harder to follow, any decent IDE will let you control-click into the definition of classes. I'd argue that less LoC is a good thing (so long as we're not talking about ""clever code"", which this isn't).<p>If you are looking at a block of code and the execution flow is dependent on an entire framework's dependency resolution mechanism (autoload or similar), with inexplicit dependencies, then it seems to be an obtuse perspective to argue that the code has not lost the property of being explicit.<p>> Even with this simple example, the non-require version is 2000x's faster than the require version. This is also in a perfect world, e.g. there's no other files also being required that'd overflow the realpath cache, nor is there really any other OS activity that will hamper my tests. In the wild, there could be 50-100 requests being served concurrently, which would affect the system calls even more.<p>First of all, clarity of code is far more important than performance in almost every case.  If you really want to justify the lack of explicit dependencies on a performance basis, my point is that it's not possible.<p>>  with this simple example, the non-require version is 2000x's faster than the require version<p>Err, here's what I got.<p>test1: 0.0000250\ntest2: 0.0177090\ntest3: 0.0062518 (same as test2 but with require_once instead of require)<p>Yeah the overhead is larger, no it doesn't really mean anything. However you include, you still have to include. not including is faster than require_once() is faster than require().  Nothing shocking there. I believe if you add APC and php-cgi and/or tmpfs as a mountpoint (vs. raw disk) this will decrease markedly, with no requirement to alter code.<p>I remain unconvinced.<p>Props on the custom framework vibe, IMHO every time I've looked, what's out there prebuilt is all crap (not relevant for anything but web-only, OO-centric, high overhead both performance and cognitive).",1357843800

As an experienced programmer, you have habits and intuition that make developing and debugging your code vastly easier than for a novice. The reason that C has given so much ground to a language like Java is not that Java is intrinsically more powerful, but that novice and intermediate programmers can be much more productive with it from the start. Companies don't want to hire a 10-year C veteran at $125/hr to code up their CRUD app, even if one were readily available. They want  to be able to hire interchangeable $50/hr Java guys with a bit of experience, who won't have to waste days at a time trying to track down intermittent memory problems or re-writing the wheel because they aren't aware someone wrote a C lib for something Java has built-in.",1357843733

To the guy programming a fancy toaster in whatever version of an Assembly language C is a high level language. To be anally retentive and follow your comment about the ranking of languages, if I follow that logic then the only two low level languages would be C, Assembly, and perhaps a compiler complier circa the early 70's that whose name I cant remember.

Assuming, he can quickly filter out a significant portion, it's possible to be very involved and have a significant chance of a large exit. This, of course, assumes that he's good at what he does which is an underlying assumption of this whole proposition.<p>Rationale:\nLet's assume a home-run rate of about 3% which is my rough estimate of what it is for YC startups. That means that funding 75 startups yields a 90% chance of at least one home run.<p>Now one might ask how long this will take. If we assume that 50% of the companies can be marked as failures quickly, he will only need to invest substantial time in ~37 companies. If he can focus principally on 3 at a time for a period of 6 months, it will take approximately 6 years to achieve a 90% home run probability. Of course, he'll almost certainly have had some modest successes before then.<p>Again this is all predicated on hmexx being good at selecting and advising startups.

I would never have believed such a simple conjecture could provide so much illumination around the myths and realities of startups.<p>First, its a great deal, both for hmexx and folks who take him up on it. Frankly I think it could be revolutionary. My reasoning is as follows;<p>Many ""products"" over the last couple of years have been fairly straight forward web ""apps"" built on top of existing infrastructure. They provide some basic customer value, they tend to be fashionable (moderate lifetime), and generally take less than a year to produce.<p>That is almost exactly the same as the book publisher model.<p>So hmexx sets himself up as an MVP ""publisher"" and pays ""authors"" $5000 up front and a 50% interest in the proceeds going forward. Now lots of new book authors would <i>love</i> that deal because they know how to write books but they have no idea how to promote them into bookstores and Amazon's top lists etc. Unlike books though web apps don't pay out a revenue stream on per-unit sales. Instead they tend to either a pay a chunk via a buyout, or they generate income over time with advertising/partnerships. If we're talking about ""apps"" for mobile then there is a revenue stream very similar to books.<p>So I reason its a good deal because the content creator has a much better chance to benefit from their creation than previous generations of artists had.<p>Now as an illumination, the whole 50/50 thing shines a light right into the core of the startup 'dream' mentality. It is the idea that you will start a company that becomes the next Facebook and you become a billionaire over about 10 years of nights. 50% of zero is zero, 50% of a billion dollar company is $500M worth. The closer reality is that if the idea has 'legs' then you can expect a series A round that will reduce both of you to 33% and then a series B which takes you to 20% to 25%. If you get there you're probably making a decent salary and have some small but non-zero shot of a return.<p>Every year somebody makes over $50M on one of the big lottery games in the US, its only like once in 5 years that people make over $50M from their startup. The good news is that fewer people have the chops to ""buy in"" to a startup lottery ticket.<p>So that is the reality. If you want to make some money, buy a house, raise a family. Go work for Oracle or Apple or Microsoft or Google. Don't do startups for the money, do them because you are passionate about what they are trying to create. If you do them for the money you will become bitter and depressed.<p>But this offer, to be paid $5000 in exchange for a half interest in the lottery ticket you create? Given the 'two, three month' worth of work estimate. There is not a whole lot to complain about.",1357841485

For example, in some places, they seem to be the norm for things like on-line banking or interaction with government web sites. As a second example, they are also used for UIs on network-accessible devices. As a third, Ive seen quite a few used for interactive illustrations on academic/training web sites. People have been doing these things with Java for at least as long as theyve been doing them with Flash. And there are plenty more cases: tomjen3 already mentioned games, IIRC the conference call/screen sharing service used by one of my clients is Java-based, etc.<p>The likes of Google and Mozilla might want us all to drop these tried and tested technologies and move to shiny new ones like HTML5 and the latest JS and CSS developments, but realistically, it takes time for users to move on. Most of us dont have the luxury of controlling our customers platforms so we can ensure they run up-to-date builds of Firefox or Chrome with all the latest toys.<p>It takes time for developers to move on, too. Im currently working on a project that uses a Java applet for a client. If I were starting the same project today, Id probably chose different tools, but it wasnt started today, and not so many years ago when the architectural decisions were being made, those new tools didnt exist yet.<p>The main thing holding Java applets back today seems to be the second rate support they now get from the major browsers and/or Oracle, assuming they are supported at all. The number of blatant, show-stopping bugs in browser/Java interactions is getting silly, and code that has worked for years is breaking because someone installed a software upgrade. Thats a pity, IMHO, because the JVM is still a decent platform, and there are several interesting modern programming languages other than Java itself that we could be using to develop web apps otherwise.",1357841221

Thank you for experimenting and being creative.<p>A couple thoughts:<p>* If you have a month to work on a project, consider taking this offer.  Nothing helps motivate people (myself included) like a deadline and a partner.  Don't get hung up on the equity split or other boring details -- just go do it.  And be thankful you have the free month to work as you will; not all of us are so fortunate!<p>* I am skeptical using 50-50 as a basis for a partnership in general, much less with someone on the internet I've never met.  You are probably a chill dude, but I had similar optimism for too many girls I met online... :)  Everyone claims to be funny and open to new things.  If I had goals to work on this project fulltime, I'd be very concerned that the two of us might not work well together (I have no reason to believe this, but this is a risk based on past experience).  I'd prefer some way to break ties.  Either 49/51 split or something.  If I had goals to work on this as an anonymous internet side project like my github work that happens to generate income, then rock on with 50/50 because it's simpler and anything else gets in the way of the product.<p>* Would you mind documenting the outcome of this experiment?  PG often cites YC's internal data as influencing their decisions.  Not having access to that data and believing I see a large number of survival biases on HN, I'd be curious to see someone as honest as you document what actually happens.  If anything, I imagine the outcome from the experiment will better inform you of improvements than any comment from HN.<p>* Best of luck!  I love creative experiments.  No one here knows how this will turn out, but I know we all are interested to follow along.",1357841067

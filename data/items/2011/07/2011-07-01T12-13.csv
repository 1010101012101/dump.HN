The mainstream wants something that their other <i>mainstream</i> (not early adopter) friends are also using. The early adopters are revolutionaries. The mainstream likes status quo. But that's true about every single technology. Facebook has gone through this, too. Twitter, as well. Would your mom or wife use Twitter in the first year after Twitter launched? But I think Google+ transition to mainstream will be pretty smooth, because it's a great and easy to use product, and it's just a matter of having enough early critical mass to get everyone to hear about it.<p><a href=""http://www.quickmba.com/marketing/product/diffusion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quickmba.com/marketing/product/diffusion/</a>",1309525198

But Fexl converts that into pure combinators like so:<p><pre><code>  \flip = (S (C (S I)) C)

2718082,comment,2717281,2717519,2,0,Symmetry,,,"<i>People tend to undervalue security until it's too late.</i><p>This seems unclear to me.  Surely, in being disproportionaly exposed to failures of security, as opposed to people getting away with insecure practices or the inconvenience of good security procedures, security professionals are going to have a distorted view of the costs of security?  People tend to be very bad at multiplying in the process of making moral judgements[1], and its very hard to give equal weight to the sum total of traveler inconvenience our airline security policies cause relative to the risk of terrorist attacks.  And there's no reason to think that the TSA takes into account the >100 people killed each year by their policies [2].  If you think that airline passengers aren't going to allow another 9/11 that's probably more deaths right there than the TSA could plausibly claim to be preventing in terms of airline bombings.<p>I don't think private airline security would be perfect and it probably would go a bit too far towards lax security, but it would almost certainly be much better than what we have right now.<p>[1] As an example, people will pay almost as much money to save the lives of 10 starving orphans as they will to save 1 starving orphan.  No, I didn't get that reversed, and if you've ever studied psychology you shouldn't find that too surprising.<p>[2] <a href=""http://aem.cornell.edu/faculty_sites/gb78/wp/JLE_6301.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aem.cornell.edu/faculty_sites/gb78/wp/JLE_6301.pdf</a>

When the PC came along, it wasn't as capable as the minicomputer, but it let you have a lot more control over your own environment, and it was a <i>lot</i> cheaper. Or what about desktop publishing versus old page layout solutions.  Not as capable, but way cheaper and way easier to use, it ended up completely wiping out the old typesetting systems.<p>I see FCPX in a similar light.  It may not be as capable as the other video editors out there in terms of format support / workflow support (and I include FCP7 in the list of competitors), but what it does do, it does really well.  FCPX is blazingly fast compared to the other video editors out there, and that is a killer feature.  Over time we can expect Apple to provide better workflow support - they've already indicated that they are adding xml support and a few other things that will go towards addressing many criticisms of workflow changes.  Format support, and in particular tape support, may get left behind, but in this brave new world, tape is less and less relevant.",1309524059

Because OO isn't a perfect fit to modern hardware, is often not the most cache or out-of-order-execution friendly way to organise code and data, doesn't lend itself well to parallelism and isn't suited for stream processors (GPU, PS3's SPEs...)<p>Actually, the PS3 pretty much forces data to be organised in structures of arrays for the SPEs, as far as I know.<p>So, yes, as far as I can tell, games do use some form of OO these days, but they also seem to be moving more and more to a data-oriented parallel/streamcache friendly non-OO architecture. I don't think OOP will be forgotten any time soon, of course, as it is still a useful means of modelling games and code, but I do think OO will become increasingly less important.<p><a href=""http://research.scee.net/files/presentations/gcapaustralia09/Pitfalls_of_Object_Oriented_Programming_GCAP_09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.scee.net/files/presentations/gcapaustralia09...</a><p><a href=""http://gamesfromwithin.com/category/data-oriented-design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gamesfromwithin.com/category/data-oriented-design</a><p><a href=""http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are...</a><p><a href=""http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/start"" rel=""nofollow"">http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/start</a><p><a href=""http://justinliew.com/blog/?p=2890"" rel=""nofollow"">http://justinliew.com/blog/?p=2890</a>",1309523795

  <a href=""https://github.com/chkoreff/Fexl/blob/master/src/long_add.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chkoreff/Fexl/blob/master/src/long_add.c</a><p>In short, when you evaluate (long_add 2 3), that value is <i>replaced</i> with the number 5, right inside the machine data structure.  So in that sense there is a ""side effect"", but it's a purely functional referentially transparent side effect only in the C internals -- nothing mutable going on at the Fexl level.<p>I'm all well-versed with CPS (continuation-passing style), e.g. I've done stuff like this:<p><pre><code>  \do_stuff = (\state\return
      do_this state \state
      do_that state \state
      return state)
</code></pre>
But that doesn't in itself help me, yet.<p>By swapping the order of the parameters ""state"" and ""return"" in do_stuff, do_this, and do_that, I can transform that function into a monadic style:<p><pre><code>  \do_stuff = (\return
      do_this;
      do_that;
      return)
</code></pre>
But as it turns out that accomplishes nothing <i>essential</i> -- it is merely a syntactic difference.<p>Keep in mind that Fexl is purely combinatorial, and ultimately what's really going on under the hood are the application of these two rules:<p><pre><code>  C x y    =  x
  S x y z  =  x z; y z
</code></pre>
So maybe that will give you some insight into just how irredeemably lazy this language really is.  :)<p>(Yes there are some other combinators such as I, L, R, and Y, but these are ultimately shorthands for S and C forms.)<p>If by ""interleave the add operations"" you are suggesting a change to the core evaluation strategy used in the interpreter, that is probably out of the question -- I've made my bed there and I have to lie in it.  There's not much I can do at this point about my reliance on combinators, I mean, check out the S combinator:  <a href=""https://github.com/chkoreff/Fexl/blob/master/src/S.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chkoreff/Fexl/blob/master/src/S.c</a> .  That's baked in the cake!<p>But if you mean there's something I can do different in my Fexl function itself, that might be something to consider.<p>I tried the full gamut here, using both accumulator and CPS:<p><pre><code>  \test_big_sum_4 =
  (

  \sum == (\N \total \return
      long_le N 0
          (return total)
          (sum (long_sub N 1) (long_add total N) return)
          )

  # TODO still a problem!!
  \N = 100000
  sum N 0 \total
  print ""sum 1 .. ""; print N; print "" is ""; print total;nl;
  )

  test_big_sum_4
</code></pre>
But to no avail:  it still uses up large amounts of memory.<p>However, I could force the evaluation of (long_sub N 1) and (long_add total N), and that might do the trick.  Then it'll be totally tail recursive with machine integers at every turn, and run in constant memory.",1309523188

It's about magnifying, in your enemy's mind, what is actually a small threat.<p>If you have an entire military, you don't use terrorism; you kill your enemies en masse. If you're a small band of nutjobs, you scrape together the resources for a few small hits. You hope that fear will do the rest of the job of crippling your enemy.<p>The way to defeat terrorism is to <i>not be terrified</i>. To call them on their bluff. ""You are a tiny band of nutjobs. You can't kill us all. You can't even kill .00001% of us. You are less of a problem than peanut allergies.

3844343,comment,3843839,3843839,2,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Even if it's significantly better, do the means justify the ends? On massive sites with millions of images, like flickr or facebook, converting all their jpegs into webps to save on bandwidth and speed would mean that they would have to duplicate every single jpeg image (keep the jpegs for older browsers) with a webp copy to serve to newer browsers that support webp. But by doing that you're nearly doubling the HD space of the entire service. More HDs, more servers, more electricity, more personnel. So whatever money was saved on bandwidth (which is getting cheaper all the time) is negated by the architecture required to pull off the transition.<p>I feel like this is one of those: ""good inventions that are better than the competition but have no demand from the market.""",1334516330

You have a responsibility to drive carefully.<p>Please don't make the roads any more unsafe by doing activities or encouraging others to do activities while driving that may distract them from the task of driving safely.<p>Find other ways to reclaim your commute such as moving closer to work, working from home on some days or using public transport.

They don't even want a reply.<p>* The political call to action is an annoyance; it wants me to sign a petition against CISPA. I plan to write my congress people directly instead. I don't know how I got subscribed to these, but writing this comment reminded me to unsubscribe.<p>* I don't want to read any of the four newsletters. I might want to read them some day, and ideally, they'd be filtered in to a ""newsletters"" folder and not show up as ""new mail"" when they come in.<p>* The account statement is something I want to <i>have</i> but not <i>act on</i>.

I'm kind of curious as to where these people got my email address, as they appear to be actual employers and not recruiters.<p>* I might go to the meetup.<p>* I wrote a reply to my friend, agreeing to host her website and telling her what she needs to do to make that happen.<p>How do you propose to improve my experience?",1334515443

Group conversations.<p>In the work environment, little is more frustrating than not being addressed/cc-ed on some important/critical conversation.  Someone leaves your address off, and ""Bam!"", you're out of the conversation.<p>I call this the ""submarining conversation"".  It dives below the water, and you remain unaware of it unless or until it surfaces.  (Whereupon it often causes considerable disruption.  E.g. An entire section of specifications that you were never made aware of.)<p>Or you are added to an assignment and have to spend time and effort chasing down the various email conversations that have comprised its efforts to this point.  AND... once you have them, gluing them together in your head and/or on screen or in text, in order to come up with a coherent and not overly redundant picture.<p>Google's Wave I saw as a genuine effort to address this.  Actually, it is really an iteration on the centrally stored, group conversation.  For example, web bulletin boards that were ""all the rage"" about a decade ago.<p>Wave added decentralize-able membership controls and sophisticated authoring and version control.  Things very useful in a work or similar environment.<p>It didn't need to be email.  But it could better fulfill a role too often filled poorly by email.<p>HOWEVER, Google slapped a ridiculously bogged down and unintuitive user interface on top of it, then said ""figure it out"".  And so, it died, at least as a Google product and with respect to gaining Google's potential momentum.<p>SO, I'd say there are some applications of email, that could better be done other ways than through email.  But this is not email's fault.  It is the result of the limitations of users, both conceptually and in terms of the limited scope of tools that -- particularly in many work environments -- they are supplied and permitted.<p>P.S.  Such organization of conversations pertains not only to contemporary work, but also to compliance and audit-ability.  When trying to determine later what happened, with email conversations one it left to obtain, search, and/or reconstruct any number of email archives, hoping that none of the archives nor individual messages have been irretrievably lost or deleted.",1334514858

I wonder what computer scientists thought of a general purpose ""all-you-can-edit"" online encyclopedia in the late 1990s. The quote from Vannevar Bush in a sibling comment mentions a ""profession of trail blazers"" contributing content and links, which sounds more like Nupedia or Knol. As McCarthy with m-expressions, Jimbo found out Nupedia was superfluous.<p>[1] Often inaccurately summarized as ""Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible""; <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Thomson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Thomson</a>",1334514504

The people who love it <i>dearly</i> love it, and it is exceptionally great for any type of linear algebra or relational database problem. One of the interesting insights I was made aware of: in K, the slowest operation is usually no more than an order of magnitude slower than the fastest. Since all of the operators are 'approximately the same speed' it's much easier to reason about a program's performance. It's also the reason K programmers obsess over the character length of a solution, often the shorter solution <i>is</i> the faster one.<p>On the downside, I found K to be very polarizing with respect to interoperability. There is a K way to do something and 'the other ways,' and attempting to bridge the gap leads to a lot of headaches. Part of it is that K is so good 'inside' that not as much effort is given to interacting outside of that world. The K programmers I know are aware of this, and I think this is more of a critique on the size of the community rather than its mindset. They're focused on solving actual problems rather than the gardening involved to keep the language friendly.<p>One nice thing is that K programmers tend to be higher up on  the intelligence side of things[1], so if you meet someone who knows it you're probably in for a great conversation.<p>[1] like look at this crazy shit <a href=""http://www.nsl.com/k/ray/ray.k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsl.com/k/ray/ray.k</a>",1334514501

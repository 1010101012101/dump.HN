I check my email every morning over breakfast so it could work out nicely.<p>If you want to put some advertisements (that aren't obnoxious) along with the data, I really don't care. I am a moderately affluent college-aged male who enjoys buying electronics, games, and other goods online on a frequent basis.",1199051949

93729,comment,93654,93658,0,0,icky,,,"> This has been asked before, a lot of the comments seem to revolve around the idea that it is unpreventable.<p>It's a hard problem, but not impossible.  The structure and function of the site itself plays a large part in governing group behavior.<p>Reddit worked for a long time because it had smart people, and a voting system that responded to whatever its userbase wanted.  Now it's in rapid decline because it has a growing majority of not-so-smart people, and the voting system still responds to whatever the userbase wants.  Reddit also suffered from being known as the site where smart people hang out, which brought lots of Digg refugees over to it (thereby destroying the quality they were looking for).<p>I'd be very interested in seeing a list of reddit headlines with votes weighted by seniority on the site.  It might resemble classic reddit.",1199051535

93726,comment,93654,93657,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I wasn't thinking about this regarding YC news's quality.  It's remained amazingly stable since I've been using it.  I was thinking about this regarding Reddit, and how the signal to noise ration seems to be degrading even more recently.  The main reddit is fairly unusable for me now, although I like the science and programming sub-reddits.<p>I was asking for ideas for future reference regarding sites with social components.  It seems to be a common problem online:  how to avoid the troll issue and signal to noise degradation issue.  <p>I was thinking that votes could be weighted based on  length of stay, or karma or both. Users who've been around longer and who had higher karma are obviously more invested in the site than hoards of users that just started.<p>@PG:  I really hadn't thought of weighting everyone's votes similar to the editors.  A nice, elegant solution I think.",1199050414

93723,comment,93537,93710,0,0,aswanson,,,"I disagree.  Critism of college in terms of what it proclaims to be and what it is, I think, is as healthy as self criticism.  You could argue that criticising college is a form of hyper-intellectualism, in which case the person criticising makes the observation that it does not live up to it's ideal in many cases.",1199050061
93722,comment,93654,93654,0,0,gojomo,,,"One dimension of the problem is that misleading, attention-whoring headlines work. (Maybe the sites even like these, because they generate traffic in discussion threads.)<p>Headlines could be rated separately from the link; perhaps a smaller group of trusted editors, or a random panel of unassociated readers, could approve/edit headlines. Further, votes without having visited the target article could be deweighted. <p>Another dimension is vote-gaming, including outright fraud. Increasing the cost of votes, with captchas or even registration/poll fees, might help. <p>Actually making vote-mobs explicit, as in the 'Uberfact' idea [+], I also think has potential. That is, rather than making recommendations/correlations for every user account, let users create their own named cliques. (Let the founders of such cliques have ultimate say on who else can join as voters.) Then, every article gets a different score per clique, and you can view the 'top' items from any clique's (or combination of cliques') perspective, whether you share their views or not.<p>Some cliques could be ideological, others by membership in some external community, others purely automated (perhaps mirroring some external scoring, like PageRank or Digg-score). Then you channel a lot of the gaming into a more productive and filterable expression of passion; the default view of the site might degrade, but even slightly savvy users can extract a elite, useful view. <p>[+] <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/uberfact-ultimate-social-verifier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/uberfac...</a>",1199049886

The ARM based at91sam9260 has that functionality and runs linux.  Low priced ($6 in volume), it seems like a good place to start for you.",1199049804

And closed development is not necessarily closed source! And the iPhone running Linux would not make it a worse (or necessarily  better) product. They would have to release their modified kernel code but that is it. How would this effect the final product? This has to be a joke article, or this guy is truly ignorant. Yet, he claims to support open source at times...",1199049783
93719,comment,93654,93712,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Both digg and reddit have karma systems so that each vote is not equal. I think that as a social news site grows (or any community), you have to subdivide the community somehow - essentially create a collection of niche sites.",1199049723
93718,comment,93654,93654,0,0,ericb,,,"You hit the nail on the head. The next ""big thing"" for social news will be an implementation of an ""editors"" concept. Social sites don't have the lock-in they like to think. Users moved from friendster to my space and now from my space to facebook. <p>Social news is where search was before Google came along. A  social news site that solves the editing problem (designed to naturally implement ""star editors"", perhaps) can still win big here by virtue of having better content, being less game-able, and not degrading over time. Someone do this, and send me an invite, please!",1199049323
93717,comment,93654,93654,0,0,robg,,,"I think the problem at a digg or reddit is that everyone's vote is considered equal. Yet, why should someone who's just arrived have as much say as someone who's been there for over a year? In real-life communities, voices take a while to accumulate. Why should online communities be any different? <p>I'd argue we expect that implicit hierarchy to provide a trustworthiness. If someone's submissions aren't being up-voted, they have the choice to either conform or find a community better suited to their interests. To the extent they match the community principles is the extent to which their own voice becomes heard and amplified.",1199049300

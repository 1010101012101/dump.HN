The more decisions you make about specific properties, the more special cases you will need to handle (and those are a continuing source of frustration for both programmers and users down the line).<p>In this case, most of these issues can be avoided by allowing a free text field instead of dedicated fields for street name, number, apartment, floor, state, county, district, and whatever.",1369915194

I'm glad that you and others are looking at P2P solutions to this problem.  The big challenge would be getting expert witnesses to testify in court that the timestamps are valid, or otherwise convincing the court to accept them.<p>The switch to first to file might render this moot, though, since it seems that inventions that are never made public can be ""stolen"" by someone else filing a patent at a later date (corrections welcome).",1369912126

Silverlight(Netflix) and Widevine (HBO). Currently its either a total hacky solution or impossible to use this on linux. Better have it standardized than a closed source restricted solution.",1369911997

I've averaged in the 70mph range on that trip, since there are stretches of I-5 where much higher speeds are fairly safe (and the speed limit is 75 on a lot of it).  9h of concentration isn't that unreasonable, since you do need to stop for gas once (in Oregon, usually, which means it's slow).<p>San Jose to Vegas is 523 miles, and doing that in 6-7 hours is quite feasible (although it's entirely possible for it to take 12-14 hours with traffic on I-5 and I-15 if things go wrong)",1369911888

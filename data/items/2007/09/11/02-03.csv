Amortize your equipment costs (which is what machine shops do) over a 10 year or maybe longer trend and it's perfectly profitable. Your monthly run cost may just be 20-30,000 a month.<p>There are few places open 24 hours here in the Bay and I'm so giddy about this I already sent in my money.",1189478946

Doing that by tossing out the system toolbar and hacking together your own is very questionable, though.<p>The link they put in at the bottom suggests that Leopard might adopt their selection style.  Gruber linked to it, citing it as a situation where some good can come of a company's bucking a standard.  So it turned out well, if only by luck.",1189477063

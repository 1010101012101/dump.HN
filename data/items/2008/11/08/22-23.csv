357893,comment,357856,357856,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"I had the same thought as Mark Cuban. A PhD in Economics, even winning the Nobel Prize (see my critique of Krugman) doesn't give you the real world feel that starting and running a business does. Economics is full of unintended consequences. Couple of examples, which every start-up person here can appreciate: if you make it very hard to do a lay-off, that leads to businesses becoming extremely cautious in hiring. The minimum wage directly leads to entrepreneurs not taking a chance to hire a less skilled person and train them on the job. These are easy enough to see when you run a business.<p>It would amaze  you how many things that are ""common sense"" for an entrepreneur are hard for someone sitting in their ivory tower.<p>This is not just a problem in economics. After I got out of Princeton with a PhD in Electrical Engineering, it amazed me just how orthogonal to the real world much of my adviser's academic work proved to be - I happened to land a job that <i>directly</i> dealt with one of his core areas of research, though I wasn't involved in that area during my PhD myself. My realization led me to write a paper that pointed out that his work was dealing in mathematical models that were not very relevant to the real world, which predictably led to our intellectual parting of ways.<p>I felt experience working as an engineer should be mandatory for anyone aspiring to be an engineering professor, yet you will find that most engineering faculty have never worked outside of academia.",1226184465

357890,comment,357857,357857,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I have an MBA, and this sentence is probably the most important: ""If you have a non-business undergraduate degree, then an MBA may make sense, even if your are an entrepreneur."" The MBA program was originally designed to be specifically for engineers, who, in mid-career, were taking on management roles, and needed appropriate business training to do those jobs well. And if was supposed to be for people that had been away from school and had work experience.<p>Unfortunately the programs seem to be full of business undergrads, who go straight from their undergrad and (I guess) see it as a way to differentiate themselves. If your undergrad is not in business, then the accounting and finance training alone is worth it. And lots of people do the degree part-time (as I did) so the argument that its a waste of time doesn't hold up. For the right type of person.",1226184314

He did no work in those 3 days, our company paid all his travel and food expenses, and he was pretty much guaranteed a job once the funding paperwork was filed. Personally, I would have preferred to pay him for the 3 days he was up, but then going somewhere to get free food is better than sitting at home paying for your own food ;-)<p>At least in the UK, there are plenty of opportunities to get funding for graduates. Call up your local universities and they will pay you to take people on.<p>My own internship was paid, with 2/3rds of my wage covered by my university. I'm now employed full-time here.<p>In summary, if you're looking for an internship, get one that pays.

Argument against is that they will have to change their script to deal with a non-integer when the serial number doesn't exist.""<p>Now your manager might not think that was so great, they might think you ""can't get things done"" because it took you all day and you didn't actually get a decision, the other 6 folks are pissed off because you slammed them in your snippet for being lazy, and you get slammed back for not being a team player. So you write a more 'friendly'<p>""Spent the day working on the serial number issue, not a lot of progress was made.""<p>And now your manager complains that you are being so imprecise in your snippet that nobody can tell if you're working or slacking off. So you go looking for others who are nominally at your grade level and their snippet streams. You see either snippets like:<p>""Organized a summit meeting of key stake holders around our efforts to re-architect the serial number categorization issues which are have been plaguing SRE for months. Using the input received I've put together a comprehensive plan of action for addressing system wide issues.""<p>Which is eloquently worded bullshit which makes young managers feel all happy inside but really doesn't say anything, or you see<p>""No snippets in the requested range, last snippet was xx/yy/zzzz (some year and a half to three years ago).""<p>You ask around and folks will say ""Oh everyone knows what <some engineer> is up to."" but you ask and say ""Do you?"" and they admit that no, they don't but its probably important, after all they've been here forever and they are a 'big cheese' in the system.<p>And of course if you point this out and it causes trouble for the 'big cheese' where it comes out that you asked their manager why they didn't seem to need to write snippets, well things would get really bad for you for a while. And its then that you note that what snippets 'are' is not at all obvious or useful.<p>That being said, I've always kept a note book and I write notes in it and track various projects. Its great to review and figure out what is stuck and what is making progress and it is wonderful to dump all the state into a single page or two so that I can work on a different project but 'swap back' into the stalled one just by re-reading my notes.

In the example (Java) implicit down-converting isn't allowed, so this is a result of the spec putting arbitrary limits on array size (must be indexed by nonnegative 'int' values).

Record shows to be watched later?<p>Even if the tool is as simple as going through a series of menus answering questions, the underlying mechanism is that your creating a 'program' to achieve some objective.

3530645,comment,3528940,3530525,5,0,onemoreact,,,"We already have robotic dentists doing dental work better than a human can.  Back in the dark ages of say 1995 if you wanted to get your teeth into better alignment you went to this guy who attached this complex apparatus that would forcefully move the teeth in your mouth and every so often you would go back to this same person to do adjustments and such.  Sure, it often hurt, look a long time, looked bad, interfered with proper dental care, and only allowed for fairly simple work, but at least it was expensive.<p>Now, with automation and 3D imaging technology we can have a specialist specify what to change and let a computer design a series of discrete non-invasive attachments that allow a home users to quickly attach and remove their implant.  It's far less painful, takes less time,can far more precisely preform complex work like rotating a tooth, and the only downside is it costs about the same amount as braces.  Note: This is an actual company not just BS (<a href=""http://www.invisalign.com/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.invisalign.com/Pages/default.aspx</a>).<p>PS: I still occasionally see a teller for complex interactions, but I trust an ATM to be far more accurate for my day to day needs.  And there is still plenty of work for orthodontists, but a lot of the simple stuff is simply better handled by a machine.",1327957345

Personally, I almost prefer cli at this point for lots of stuff, but a lot of it is still just so cryptic.

3530642,comment,3530199,3530523,1,0,klodolph,,,"No, you're exactly right.  The author defines ""weakness"" versus ""strongness"" as whether you can do something like ""int + array"" and get a result other than a type error.  ECMAScript is very ""weak"".  Haskell is ridiculously ""strong"" by this definition, since you get a type error for computing ""(1 :: Int16) + (1 :: Int32)"".  As far as stricter languages go, there is perhaps only Ada.<p>There are two kinds of language comparisons I've seen:<p>1. Language comparisons posted by dabblers, which you could scrape together by reading Wikipedia.  You see a lot of poor logic and unsatisfying definitions, because if the logic were sound and the definitions useful, a dabbler would never have enough expertise to write the post.<p>2. Language comparisons by experts, which restrict the discussion to history, the underlying logic of type theory, or empirical observations about a small set of languages.",1327957315

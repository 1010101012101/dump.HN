That is, if you assume every actor will act in their own personal best (best being defined as ""optimal short term rewarding"") interest at the <i>exclusion or detriment</i> of everyone else but your system still functions then it's a good idea.  For example, in your incentive example above it strikes me that some teachers would purposely not use material from other schools because they want that incentive money for themselves (game theory).<p>I would also mention that there will be a potential resource problem.  In every field there is a small subset that are the pinnacle of that field.  If your system will only pick that pinnacle then you'll be understaffed.

It's a PR stunt.  My point is only that this $100M would, on the margins, help far more kids if it were directed towards helping individual families escape the public school system.<p>For example, if I had $100M to blow, I might accept applications from families and then rank them by amount needed to convert out of public schools (from smallest to largest), and donate the money in that order for those amounts.

1718875,comment,1717307,1717307,0,0,sgentle,,,"I really like these kinds of puzzles. I'm not sure if they have a name, but I like to think of them as ""invariant puzzles"". The key to understanding them is finding an invariant - something that doesn't change when you manipulate the objects in the puzzle.<p>You can tell it's an invariant puzzle because they seem to be missing one vital piece of information. This is because one of the factors (in this case, whether a card is face up or face down) has been canceled out due to the invariant.<p>So what's the invariant? Well, let's start with what we're trying to find. We want the number of face up cards in the new deck (let's call it Deck 2) to equal the number of face up cards in the old deck (Deck 1), so Up1 = Up2. We know we can flip cards, so that's equivalent to Up1 = Down2.<p>But we're still missing a bit of information. How can we add more face down cards to the second deck when we don't know which way they're facing? Here comes the invariant... it doesn't matter! We can make Up1 and Down2 closer to equal by increasing Down2 (by moving a Down card) <i>or</i> decreasing Up1 (by moving an Up card). Essentially, the value of (Down2 - Up1) decreases by 1 when we move a card no matter what.<p>So we want to keep moving cards until (Down2 - Up1) = 0. (Down2 - Up1) starts at 10 in this case, so we do it 10 times. We flip Deck 2; Up becomes Down, Down becomes Up, and we're left with Up1 = Up2. QED!<p>Another cool invariant puzzle is the wine mixing problem (also known as the water/wine problem, the red/white marble problem): <a href=""http://www.smart-kit.com/s330/red-wine-and-white-wine-brain-teaser/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smart-kit.com/s330/red-wine-and-white-wine-brain-...</a><p>(Oh, and incidentally there are some problems that seem to be missing an important piece of information, but aren't invariant puzzles, like xkcd's Blue Eyes (<a href=""http://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html</a>).

1718833,comment,1717850,1717850,0,0,sbaqai,,,"Can someone explain to me Facebook's value? And please understand, I don't ask that to be antagonistic - from what I understand and have read, I've yet to take a side on whether facebook is the new king in SV or if its a sign of another bubble. If someone can calmly explain what value they provide, their prospects for future growth, and future competitive advantage, I'd seriously be grateful.<p>Here is what I understand:<p>Facebook earned $650M in revenue in 2009. Most of that came from brand and performance-based advertising. $50M from Microsoft ads alone. $10M on virtual goods. [1]<p>Their biggest revenue share comes from advertising. Now, again, from what I understand, their ad targeting isn't as focused as, say, Google. I'm going to make an assumption, but it makes sense to me that Google users demonstrate more purchasing intent, which is why they can charge high CPC. I've never found a Facebook ad relevant to my purpose for being on the site, but regardless, I can understand the value for any company to spend money on brand awareness, getting views on a high traffic site with quantifiable demographics.<p>Performance advertising is interesting in facebook's case. When I type in 'Digital Camera' in google, I'm voluntarily giving out a query in exchange for information. Ads for digital cameras, photography books, etc would in fact be quite welcome for a decent percentage of people. But the search-engine user controls that exchange of service. Its akin to using a hammer. Google is the tool. The functionality is in your hands.<p>Facebook's model is more of an extraction process. Someone has opened a coffee shop with free coffee - but its only free if you hang around the place. Over time, they are trying to develop a model of you based on information that is overheard and asked of you. This is where I'm unsure if its sustainable. I'd also say a great majority of facebook users don't realize how the site has changed since its inception. A large majority of my non-technical friends have no idea how information is being analyzed. I'm not sure how robust facebook's brand is if some terrible scandal/event breaks out and people become really sensitive to what they share with the site. This ""social contract"" between users, facebook, and advertisers is something I don't think the majority of users understand. They just see it as a site with their friends. And its to facebook's benefit for users not to fully understand.<p>The last point I want to make is about Social Media. I understand how its shifted interaction and all that. But my concern is with its ties to the capitalistic sense of value. Technological progress does not always = making a ton of money.  There are a lot of major technologies that changed the world . There were 2000 car companies at one point, and now only 3 american companies remain. Cars changed everything, city planning, etc, but investors, in aggregate, got fucked. The airline business is a similar story. There was also the tech bubble.<p>EDIT: I also want to add that since it is a private company, it is in almost everyone's favor to drive up its valuation. Founders, investors, and employees with stock, etc all benefit. When a company is public, there is an incentive to introduce negative information (hence the utility of short sellers).<p>Now, I'd love to hear an explanation on why its such an 800lb gorilla in the valley.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-wont-be-a-multi-billion-dollar-company-for-many-years-2010-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-wont-be-a-multi-bill...</a>",1285225308

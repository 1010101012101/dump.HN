The market didn&#x27;t collapse, so there is no such method.<p>You keep saying that, but it&#x27;s full of assumptions that simply aren&#x27;t true.  Just because a successful method exists does not mean everyone can or will apply it nor does it mean the market will collapse.<p>> How is that so hard to figure out?<p>How it it so hard for you to see the absurdity of what you&#x27;re saying?<p>> When a scientist encounters a description like this, he always assumes a priori that it&#x27;s chance. That agrees with the null hypothesis and Occam&#x27;s razor.<p>There&#x27;s a reason scientists are in general not rich people.  And I have much respect for scientists, but you&#x27;re just being absurd.<p>Investigate a bit before just claiming it&#x27;s nonsense because  you&#x27;re not giving it the thought you should, you&#x27;re just presuming you&#x27;re right and making absurd claims based on absurd assumptions that don&#x27;t hold water.<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-on-efficient-market-hypothesis-2010-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-on-efficient-m...</a>",1393451994

7308291,comment,7305938,7306450,1,0,cpncrunch,,,"Actually, I think you might be better looking elsewhere for help with depression. In my own experience, and that of other people I know, psychological factors have always been the main cause of depression, and resolving them results in curing the depression. The problem is that it isn&#x27;t always easy to identify the factors causing the depression.<p>As for the science: we do know that both psychological stressors and infections both cause inflammation. Stress results in activation of the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system, which screws up the immune system in various ways (including inflammation). Conversely, having a severe infection can make you feel depressed.<p>It&#x27;s really just a theory that inflammation causes depression. I think it&#x27;s more likely that it&#x27;s a result of cortisol and/or neurotransmitters (i.e. too much brain activity). Cortisol seems a more likely candidate for being central to depression in my opinion.<p>The science here seems to be based on a desire to have a physical rather than a psychological cause for depression. Michael Maes has a history of that (see his CFS publications).",1393451839

All (or at least most of) the control structures for the language come for free, because there&#x27;s an instance of Monad.<p>This tends to be quite helpful especially in the case where there are multiple interpretations you might be interested in. For example, a graphics library might provide an interpreter that executes drawing primitives using OpenGL to put stuff on the screen directly, as well as one which interprets the same data by manipulating arrays of pixels. Perhaps another could construct an SVG.<p>To do that, you&#x27;d provide a data type whose constructors would encode whatever drawing primitives your library supported, things like circles and lines and Bézier splines, and then use the interpret function to define each interpreter by supplying a function which takes a given primitive and says how to carry out whatever actions are needed to be taken to display or render it.<p>(Note: this example is likely a little simplistic, because most of the operations in a drawing library won&#x27;t have return values, but this set-up allows for such things. You could also make a version where the things drawn also continuously produce values by reacting to user input, allowing for some sort of optional interactivity.)<p>You&#x27;d also likely define a bunch of user-facing versions of the primitives which would amount to singleton applied to each of the constructors of your data type, just for the sake of convenience and implementation-hiding.<p>Then you have a library where people can define complex drawings in terms of the primitives you provided, and supply any one of those to any one of the interpreters you defined in order to put it on the screen, or write it out to an SVG file, or whatever.<p>For no additional work, you get operations like<p>sequence :: [Drawing a] -> Drawing [a]<p>from the monad library, for taking a list of drawings and producing a drawing which carries them out in sequence (whatever you&#x27;ve decided that ought to mean via your interpretations, probably stacking them on top of each other), as well as many others.<p>A more interesting example (in that it would involve input as well as output) might be a library for coordinated communication of some sort over different types of underlying network protocols (necessitating different interpreters for the primitive communication operations). Again, you&#x27;d get lots of control structures for free, things like for-each loops, and ways to define new bits of a protocol by applying a function to the results of a bunch of smaller pieces of communication.",1393450935

With asm.js, it was a specific goal to make optimizing the code in other browsers as simple as possible. That was one of the main reasons for actually defining asm.js, so there is a clear &quot;contract&quot; - &quot;this is what compiled C++ code looks like, these patterns are easy to optimize in obvious ways.&quot; That avoids the risk of there being anything special about generating code using emscripten and executing it in Firefox: the generated code is asm.js with the &quot;contract&quot; just mentioned.<p>For Dart there isn&#x27;t anything comparable. dart2js emits JavaScript code, which runs in all browsers, but there is no reason to think it&#x27;s performance is or will stay similar to the Dart VM. Instead, the Dart strategy there seems to be more along the lines of &quot;the Dart VM is open source, if you want comparable performance to Chrome you can adopt that codebase.&quot; There is merit to that approach - it&#x27;s much better than if Dart were closed source - but it is quite different than the one in the previous paragraph.<p>The second major difference is that while both Dart and asm.js relate to both content creation and execution, one is made by Google, which owns several of the most important sites on the web, whereas the other is made by Mozilla which obviously is nowhere near anything of the sort and not even trying to be.<p>Why this last point matters is that if the VM eventually becomes much faster than the dart2js path, Google can essentially force other browsers&#x27; hands by adopting Dart on Google sites. Imagine if google.com, gmail, google docs etc. all run much faster on the VM than otherwise - other browsers would be forced to adopt the VM to stay relevant. This is huge leverage that Google has. You can&#x27;t be a browser that people use if you are not competitive on Google-owned properties.<p>Going back to the previous point, should that happen, adopting the VM might be the only option - there is no way, unlike with asm.js, to get similar performance otherwise (in the asm.js case, the high performance is achieved with a small modification to an existing JS engine, which could be done on other engines as well - no one needs to adopt SpiderMonkey). So this is the potential bad scenario that could happen due to both of these issues.<p>Obviously there are similarities between Dart and asm.js too, as you mentioned. But I believe the two factors I described explain much of the concern some people have about what Google&#x27;s plans with Dart are. It might all end up ok, but Google might also leverage its huge influence in multiple areas for what is best for Google, and not for the web as a whole. There is no such risk with asm.js.",1393450877

Instead of pitching Very Important Programmers all day, I pitch Very Important Editors.  But, unsurprisingly, the things that make a great story pitch are the same things that make a great recruiting pitch.  You&#x27;re completely right - research, knowing your audience and his/her skills, history, and interests, are more important than anything else.  Candidness and full disclosure are key, as is professionalism.  And receiving dozens of emails a day from people who pitch without abiding by those processes is probably a huge pain in the ass.<p>However.<p>I think it&#x27;s also important to realize, from a recruiter&#x27;s perspective, that not everyone feels the same way you do.  How would a recruiter know, before you posted this extremely condescending letter, that you&#x27;re too important to speak to anyone but your mother on the phone?  Some people prefer the phone to email (I certainly think it can be more efficient, especially when dealing with Q&A).  How would a recruiter know that you actually WANT to not be considered for amazing jobs in certain areas because of your sexuality?  (In my thinking, that&#x27;s a type of discrimination that should be discouraged.)  How is a recruiter to know that what would be too much detail in a job description for another potential hire is not enough detail for you?  Or vice-verse?<p>Everyone is busy.  Recruiters are busy, programmers are busy, stay at home moms are busy, CEOs are busy.  As soon as you think you&#x27;re too important and busy to show other people respect, there&#x27;s a problem.<p>I certainly think you&#x27;re right about many things.  Publicists who send blanket mass pitches that begin &quot;Dear editor,&quot; give the rest of us a bad rap and make our jobs that much harder.  But closing your letter with &quot;Most engineers hate recruiter pitches not because we hate being pitched, it’s because we hate dealing with recruiters&quot; tells me even if a recruiter follows all of your guidelines and sends you amazing pitches, you&#x27;ll still think of him/her as a less important person than you, and treat her/him accordingly - simply because of the career they&#x27;ve happened to choose.  As a person who&#x27;s been on the receiving end of emails like yours before (along the lines of &quot;I don&#x27;t deal with publicists&quot;) I can tell you you&#x27;re not going to gain a lot of respect by making sure everyone knows how Very Important you are.  If I were a top recruiter and happened to read this, you can bet I wouldn&#x27;t bother approaching you in the future - I&#x27;d look for someone who communicates like he remembers what it&#x27;s like to not be on top.",1393450415

While her tumor is shrinking (it was originally the size of a baseball), her doctors continuously insist on more and more treatment to get it as small as possible, even though it’s stage-IV. Her treatments are so fucking specialized that even after the insurance company does their thing, we’re still out five-figures per treatment. It’s insane, and criminal. When asked if there were any alternatives, the reply is always, “this is what we have to treat her with. There’s nothing around it.”<p>While I’m not a conspiracy theorist, I’m confident in saying that someone is getting paid. Guess what? It’s not my mom.<p>There was news today, however, that with four more months of what she’s doing with her treatments, she might have bought herself another year to live. If everything goes to plan, she’d able to pump the brakes on all these hardcore treatments.<p>In August of 2013, I had in excess of $150k in my savings. This was from good client relationships, an acquisition, some domains I sold, a lucky lotto ticket, and always being thrifty. (and not spending money on clothes, though I desperately need some)<p>When it was confirmed she was very ill in late October of 2013, I moved back home. I packed up all my stuff, said cheers to my startup fam on the coast (which I was going to do anyway), and began a frivolous job hunt. I sold my car, and everything I could, because I knew what was about to come.<p>My bank account is nearly dry. It’s currently sitting at $10. Yes, just $10. My checking account is at $1.26, and there are no pending checks, or wires, coming my way.<p>Where did the money go? 97% of it went to my mom’s bills: 4 months of treatments, drugs, hospital visits, seeing specialists…<p>My father, who is a good man some of the time, hasn’t had a relationship with my mother for 25 years. How they popped out three kids is beyond me. (it’s funny because if you look at our birthdays, our dates of conception are all holidays!) There are politics behind that which I don’t care to go into but will if asked.<p>Sometimes he’s a good father, particularly to my brother -- why? I don’t know. He does nothing special, and has an assortment of issues (violence, anger). My sister, being the only girl of two generations on my father’s side, is of course spoiled endlessly.<p>My sister, while we’re on the subject: She’s my best friend, and she sticks up for me whenever my family (“ “) decides to talk shit about me -- because I’ve been so removed for so long, and still misunderstood, my mother/father/brother assume the things that happened so many years ago and applies them now. My sister will plead with them in tears in her eyes, begging for them to just get the facts straight.<p>What does my word mean? Very little to them. To my sister? Everything.<p>Here’s a picture. <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/EZNKdI0.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/EZNKdI0.png</a> Yes, she is beautiful.<p>My father is able to provide the basics, but not able to assist in the bigger picture of things for reasons I’m not cleared to know. He was taken back by me taking control up until this point, but now the future is up in the air. Will she get her treatments? That depends if it becomes classified as “emergency” by the hospital.

He didn’t for his own mother who he was close to, so I’m just going to assume he’ll continue to be negligent.<p>I can’t take out a loan because my credit is bamboozled. I’m already in about $6k in debt and it’s not fun.<p>I’m desperate to do what I can for my mom. I haven’t always been the best of son, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not trying to be now. I am doing what I would do for anyone, and because it’s my mom, it’s all that more dear to my heart.<p>I have a (mostly) full-time job right now, co-founding a startup that we’re bootstrapping. I’m yet to get a paycheck after almost 2 months of work because my co-founder hit a snag with some investors from a previous gig. I’m OK with this because in the long-run things will be golden. While those checks would be nice, they don’t cover much unfortunately. Thankfully, though, I have a lot of what I need to do done, so I’m able to look for other work to fill the gaps.<p>I’d get a full-time job but I don’t have a car and I live in the deep suburbs of Minneapolis. I’m also terrified of driving in the snow (PTSD). I Uber everywhere (I won some monthly credit on my account a while ago).<p>If anyone has any work they can kick off their hands / can put me to use for, I’d be gracious to take it. I know my ways with Ruby and I do love Rails. Lately I’ve whipped up some SaaS platforms, written APIs, conquered APIs, mined iTunes/Play Stores, built my mom an app to keep track of her meds, stuff like that. I’ll email a portfolio / linkedin / whatever when we talk.<p>To all of you, &quot;Be Content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are.

7307908,comment,7307299,7307299,2,0,joewrong,,,"Dear Secretary Lew, Chairwoman Yellen, Commissioner Curry, Acting Chairman Wetjen, Chairman Gruenberg, Chairwoman White:<p>I write today to express my concerns about the US Dollar. This cash currency is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly unstable and disruptive to our economy. For the reasons outlined below, I urge regulators to take appropriate action to limit the abilities of this highly unstable currency.<p>By way of background, the US Dollar is a crypto-currency that has gained notoriety in recent months due to its rising exchange value and relation to illegal transactions. Each the US Dollar is defined by a public address and a private key, thus the US Dollar is not only a token of value but also a method for transferring that value. It also means that the US Dollar provides a unique digital fingerprint, which allows for anonymous and irreversible transactions.<p>The very features that make the US Dollar attractive to some also attract criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement. Due to the US Dollar&#x27;s anonymity, the cash market has been extremely susceptible to hackers and scam artists stealing millions from the US Dollars users. Anonymity combined with the US Dollar&#x27;s ability to finalize transactions quickly, makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse fraudulent transactions.<p>The US Dollar has also become a haven for individuals to buy black market items. Individuals are able to anonymously purchase items such as drugs and weapons illegally. I have already written to regulators once on the now-closed Silkroad, which operated for years in supplying drugs and other black market items to criminals, thanks in large part to the creation of the US Dollar.<p>That is why more than a handful of countries, and their banking systems, have cautioned against the use of the US Dollar. Indeed, it has been banned in two different countries--Thailand and China--and South Korea stated that it will not recognize the US Dollar as a legitimate currency. Several other countries, including the European Union, have issued warnings to the US Dollar users as their respective governments consider options for regulating or banning its use entirely. While it is disappointing that the world leader and epicenter of the banking industry will only follow suit instead of making policy, it is high time that the United States heed our allies&#x27; warnings. I am most concerned that as the US Dollar is inevitably banned in other countries, Americans will be left holding the bag on a valueless currency.<p>Our foreign counterparts have already understood the wide range of problems even with the US Dollar&#x27;s legitimate uses - from its significant price fluctuations to its deflationary nature. Just last week, the US Dollar prices plunged after the currency&#x27;s major exchange, Mt. Gox, experienced technical issues. Two days ago, this exchange took its website down and is no longer even accessible. This was not a unique event; news of plummeting or skyrocketing the US Dollar prices is almost a weekly occurrence. In addition, its deflationary trends ensure that only speculators, such as so-called &quot;the US Dollar miners,&quot; will benefit from possessing the cash currency. There is no doubt average American consumers stand to lose by transacting in the US Dollar. As of December 2013, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows 1. % inflation, while a recent media report indicated the US Dollar CPI has 98% deflation. In other words, spending the US Dollar now will cost you many orders of wealth in the future. This flaw makes the US Dollar&#x27;s value to the U.S. economy suspect, if not outright detrimental.<p>The clear ends of the US Dollar for either transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling make me weary of its use. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued a report just this month stating, &quot;There is widespread concern about the the US Dollar system&#x27;s possible impact on national currencies, its potential for criminal misuse, and the implications of its use for taxation. Before the U.S. gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.<p>Sincerely,<p>U.S. Joe Manchin III<p>United States Senator",1393449439

Again, you seem to think that only lower component parts are technology (e.g the CPU itself). And you think that building a product that utilises disparate component parts (and needs tons of other engineering decisions besides) is not &quot;creation of technology&quot;. I believe this is wrong.<p>><i>If this distinction were not important, anyone who acquired a computer could claim to be its creator. If this distinction were not important, someone who put a computer in a box would be equal to someone who invented binary arithmetic.</i><p>Apple is not a company who &quot;acquires computers&quot;. It designs and builds them, including solving tons of engineering problems in the process. That it doesn&#x27;t (usually) build the low level component parts its beside the point. Technology is modular.<p>I also pointed out, which you conventiently sidestepped, that Apple also creates their very own products, from designing logic boards and dedicated processsing units, to software such as Logic, FCPX, iWork etc. They don&#x27;t just buy some Intel cpus, some Samsung disks and some X brand memory, slap it together and call it a day.<p>><i>It means someone else had the education and creativity to invent something for Steve Jobs to sell, to call &quot;fantastic&quot; to crowds of eager consumers, to import into his reality distortion field.

You forgot the part were Apple, the company he run, isn&#x27;t Best Buy (a seller), but the actual creator of the products it sells.<p>Jobs didn&#x27;t just sell stuff. That would be Jeff Bezos, or the Walmart guy. He was the CEO, and quite the micromanaging product manager in the company (actually, companies) that also designed and build those products.<p>He was the CEO of a tech company. Not the CEO of a reseller chain. And, yes, he wasn&#x27;t an engineer himself. Technology, as available to the people, is not created by engineers alone, especially in the form of final products.<p>And engineers don&#x27;t just work in isolation and deliver their stuff ready for manufacture to some sales guy. They take directions, advice, suggested changes to how stuff works, etc, from a product manager guy -- and Jobs was very much hands on with such things. For the mere selling of stuff, Apple had Cook and top level retail managers on board.<p>After all, you sure know that Steve Jobs had got the &quot;Vollum Award for Distinguished Accomplishment in Science and Technology, Oregon&#x27;s most prestigious academic honor&quot;?

That&#x27;s pretty cool.<p>A problem with this algorithm is that it&#x27;s pretty slow. It would be hard to use it for real time scaling.<p>I think that it&#x27;s pretty cool though for any precalculated conversion to vector format.  It would also be pretty cool if there were software that allowed you to create a pixel art image with a live preview in this format and the ability to export into a vector format.<p>One of the benefits of pixel art IMO is that it&#x27;s got a pretty distinct style and its simplicity and restrictions means it&#x27;s easy to be aware of composition where if you are given an unrestricted canvas that freedom can make it hard to know where to start.  If you are given a 8x8 pixel grid to indicate &quot;happy&quot; there&#x27;s only so many ways to do it, a symbolic heart, a little smiley face, etc.  Given a whole sheet of paper you&#x27;ll have more difficulty.<p>With the high res displays, there&#x27;s more to consider than just the upscaling of old programs, the fact is people (especially indie game devs) still want to work with pixel art, and the number of titles with the term &quot;8-bit&quot; in their name that have come out recently.  Part of that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s in vogue now, but a big part of it is simply that a poor artist can make a passable 24x24 sprite.<p>But it&#x27;s still a shame that on high res displays they end up looking like a blocky mess. If you had a program that let you author your sprites under the same conditions, but let you preview an upscaled version and left you with a vector image (or high res texture with mip maps) you can make use of the fidelity while maintaining the simplicity.

Even if you&#x27;re running a small business on a reasonably sized EC2 instance, handling the password hashing on an already busy server can definitely cause problems if you&#x27;re serving several requests per second (or more). It&#x27;s not a big issue, but certainly a real one that many people don&#x27;t realize they have. (Interestingly, if you use NewRelic and do Bcrypt stuff -- check it out!).<p>In regards to user data -- you&#x27;re completely correct. It&#x27;s not an authentication problem.<p>I wrote about that quite a bit as I think it&#x27;s important as user data is also sensitive information. Just like you wouldn&#x27;t want to leak user password hashes, you also wouldn&#x27;t want to leak user data.<p>At stormpath, we provide the data service because we think it&#x27;s critically important to have your user data secured in the same fashion as your user authentication information -- and as a side effect -- it helps users scale this.<p>If you&#x27;re on EC2, you&#x27;ll likely get the same latency you&#x27;d have writing to a Cassandra database locally (with very small overhead) from the Stormpath service. Furthermore, our clients implement really smart caching rules, and can do interesting stuff like transparently handle object caching to a memcached or redis cluster, smartly handle data synchronization, etc.).<p>Hope that helps!<p>Also: I really do appreciate these comments, it&#x27;s an incredibly interesting topic, and it&#x27;s really useful to hear what other people think!

7881290,comment,7881171,7881171,1,0,Swizec,,,"Great article, two issues:<p>1. Instead of looking at averages for entrepreneurs (and stock-holding employees) it should look at expected values. Those take probabilities into account. So with a 0.1 chance of a $100MM payout[1] gives you an expected payout of just $10MM for ~7 years of very hard work. Not too shabby, but not spectacular either.<p>2. <i>&quot;Assuming you don’t have any exits and you work 65 hours a week while running a company (compared to 50 hours per week with a regular job)&quot;</i> ... while I agree that people work this much and more, the funny part is how a lot of cold hard research proves that working that much makes you less productive and lowers your chances of a serious payout.<p>Now can someone make this for freelancers? I feel like we&#x27;re somewhere between employees and entrepreneurs. Salary definitely grows quicker than 6% and risk is definitely smaller than &quot;pure&quot; entrepreneurs.<p>[1] billion dollar exit, let&#x27;s say $100MM actually gets into a founder&#x27;s pocket",1402534738

7881273,comment,7879942,7881243,2,0,schoen,,,"I was also just reminded of the documentary <i>The Century of the Self</i> which I think I originally saw at Aaron Swartz&#x27;s recommendation.  The documentary took me by surprise in some ways because it seemed to start off with a familiar narrative about the benefits of individualism and economic growth in giving people more choices.  But at a certain point it turned darker and described how marketers had understood that giving people certain kinds of experiences of choice and personal attention could be deployed as a means of manipulation.  It&#x27;s something like the advice I just read the other day that you can get little kids to put on their shoes by asking them <i>which pair of shoes they want to put on</i>.  The question puts the focus on their choice while directing their attention away from the question of whether they wanted to put on shoes in the first place.<p>The darker later parts of the documentary make me think that we have a lot of practice celebrating people&#x27;s power of choice and freedom from constraint (which I fully agree with).  We have a lot of recent experience saying <i>yes</i> when there&#x27;s no reason not to.  What we perhaps haven&#x27;t been practicing as much is saying <i>no</i> at those times when there is a reason to.",1402534352

7881271,comment,7879756,7880545,6,0,Pacabel,,,"The reviews I&#x27;ve read about the existing Firefox OS phones, which have reportedly cost well over $25, have not been very encouraging. Pretty much all of them have pointed out that the hardware is quite poor, and this results in a rather bad user experience. Even considering how rapidly the cost of mobile hardware has been decreasing, what will prevent a similarly negative user experience on these cheaper Firefox OS devices?<p>While the ideological benefits of HTML5/JavaScript/CSS &quot;apps&quot; are often touted, we&#x27;ve yet to see anything truly remarkable done using such technologies. At best, we&#x27;ve only really seen clones of existing Android and iOS apps, but these generally feel less responsive and less capable than their native counterparts. If Firefox OS only supports these kind of non-native apps, how is it supposed to truly compete with Android, iOS and the other mobile platforms that support these HTML5/JavaScript/CSS &quot;apps&quot; just fine, but also offer far more choice and capabilities to developers in the form of real native apps?<p>And one other thing that I rarely see considered by the advocates of Firefox OS is how we&#x27;re seeing more and more used iOS and Android mobile devices ending up in developing nations. They tend to be quite affordable and usable, even if they are somewhat outdated. Why would people in developing nations pay for a new Firefox OS phone, when they can get a used Android or iOS phone that may very well perform better than the Firefox OS phone, while offering a wider selection of apps, while also costing roughly the same?<p>Can you address these concerns?",1402534341

7881243,comment,7879942,7880848,5,0,schoen,,,"I just read the book <i>Two Cheers for Anarchism</i>, where James Scott describes his experiences of &quot;anarchist calisthenics&quot;.  He suggests, slightly tongue-in-cheek, that practicing occasionally disobeying laws in minor ways like jaywalking could help develop a disobedience skill that he might need some day for an important moral reason.<p>I think in the same way that we who live in an exceptionally wealthy society often get little practice in giving things up, but that this practice might be beneficial.  It&#x27;s not a very original observation to notice how having so many resources and opportunities and conveniences available to us makes us feel more and more dependent and averse to every sort of inconvenience.<p>As a vegan, I always find it remarkable how emphatically people feel that it would be impossibly difficult for them to go without eating animal products, or that they can&#x27;t imagine how someone could possibly manage without them.  Maybe that&#x27;s literally true in the Aleutian Islands or the Australian Outback or something, but not so much in New York City or Portland, where one could eat in a different restaurant every day for a year without running out of vegan entrées to order directly off the menu.<p>But there are plenty of resources and technologies that I have that my parents and aunts and uncles grew up and lived and worked without for decades and that even today most of the world&#x27;s population doesn&#x27;t use—but that it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine life without.  (When I visit friends in Brazil, they don&#x27;t have a machine to dry their laundry, but use a clothesline, the way almost everybody in history has done it, and to my amazement the clothesline still works OK.  It&#x27;s not even much more labor, just more latency in the clothes-washing process.)<p>The habits we form from being well-off and having so much access to everything we want, worry some people because they consider how something could go wrong and there are skills we might need that we haven&#x27;t developed.  (We might also feel more acute suffering from losing what we&#x27;re used to; psychologists have documented that losing what you had is consistently perceived as a much greater cost than failing to gain what you didn&#x27;t have.)  War or social unrest or natural disasters or ecological disruption could strike middle-class city dwellers pretty hard because we mostly don&#x27;t know how to grow food, how to fix things, and so on.<p>But another consequence of our abundance of resources and choices, one that I think is more core to what the parent commenter is getting at, is that when we become dependent on technologies and products and resources, our demand curve for them shifts.  The people who supply these things to us have more power over us in terms of extracting money or concessions, because we and then understand that we&#x27;re unlikely to actually give up our habits.  That has consequences in terms of the difficulty in resisting changes that harm us (a classic example is if an Internet service changes its privacy policy in a way that reduces existing users&#x27; protections; service operators know that very few people will stop using the service even if most users dislike the change).  It also means that the prospect of boycotts over ethical issues that affect others is dimmer.  Manufacturers think that there&#x27;s not that much chance many people would <i>actually</i> stop buying something because of disagreements with how it was made.<p>I think it would be amazing to have a culture where people commonly had the experience of successfully giving up a habit or a product that they liked quite a bit, without being forced to, just as a result of a conscious choice.  My Catholic friends often do this once a year during Lent (the religious tradition in many communities used to be to give up specific foods, but many people today interpret it more broadly and personally pick something to give up temporarily—normally, something that they enjoy and that it will be an effort for them to give up).  From what I hear, many people find it satisfying and empowering when they succeed.  And following Scott&#x27;s idea, it might be good practice for when you decide that you do have an important reason to give something up.",1402533805

Women tend to do better than men in terms of grades, and perform competitively with men in the relevant range of logical/mathematical tests. E.g. even in the 98-99th percentile range of the SAT Math, the representation is 40% women. Tech employers, however, hire based on measures that have a large social component.

Insurance is basically a means of pooling together money then someone has to assign to fix the people that need it.<p>That's not what's wrong with healthcare. What's wrong with healthcare is that the lower middle to middle class don't have much money to be taxed with or to contribute to healthcare.<p>At the end of the day what needs to be done is someone needs to figure out how to get money and spend it wisely.

202461,comment,202311,202311,0,0,ericb,,,"Frankly this type of monitoring (geographically dispersed) is most often requested by pointy haired bosses.  Measuring is great if what you're measuring is realistically under your control. If your app is slow in Outer Mongolia, are you going to upgrade the internet backbone there? Or go upgrade the users dialup modem?<p>Only pay the extra to measure response time from say, china, if you have a target response time in mind, money, and a plausible plan to improve it if it does not meet the target. Otherwise, spend the money on making your app faster by load testing and scaling it locally and paying for a reliable, professional host. This is not to say don't monitor--you need to watch relative response times and downtime, but the services you're describing cost a lot more, and buy you very little.<p>Edit: Also, I strongly suggest transactional monitoring. If your monitor plays a transactional script (add to cart, checkout, etc) as opposed to a simple page request and you monitor the returned content, you will be able to catch all sorts of errors that are missed by simple page checking. (someone kicked the database ethernet cord out, db lost connection, etc),",1212001142

But there are so many problems in healthcare that Wal-Mart isn't positioned at all to fix.  Tens of millions of Americans need health insurance (though the 47 million number that is thrown around includes many who are young and don't want insurance, and many people in between jobs and temporarily uninsured).  If Wal-Mart can't insure it's own employees, I don't think they'll become the health insurance provider for underserved Americans.<p>That said, here is another problem that Wal-Mart can ""fix"":  It's too hard, and too expensive to see a doctor for a minor illness.  CVS' MinuteClinic and related offerings by Wal-Mart are trying to exploit this niche.<p>But basically, there is too much wrong with healthcare for any one entity  (incl the gov't) to ""fix"" it.

I, like most people, make a conscious effort to ignore things like gender and age when I'm reading someone's opinion (here or on any other site). But the fact that I sometimes have to make a CONSCIOUS effort means that there is at least a bit of a pre-existing bias or stereotype based on different demographics.

The last thing you want is that beautiful L-shaped desk not quite fitting in your office<p>4. The article mentions this, but __read__ your contract. Living in an apartment for a few years means there will be wear and tear, and this should be included as part of the contract. A lot of apartment complexes are just looking for an excuse to take away your deposit on something as flimsy as ""the carpet has worn out"". Of course its worn out, I walked on it for 3 years!<p>5. Take a tour of the apartment complex before signing up. A lot of apartment complexes advertise gyms/swimming pool facilities, where the gym has one stationary bike from the 60's and the swimming pool looks like it has not been cleaned for years. Talk to any residents if you can, and ask them about the responsiveness of the apartment's management for any and all issues especially emergencies. Considering I live by myself, I normally pay attention to that. Considering I live in OH, I normally ask how the apartment complex deals with snow and ice. This is normally a liability issue for the complex, but its best to know stuff like that<p>6. A lot of apartment complexes mandate that you need to have home owners insurance when you move it. Even if they don't, you should buy it<p>7. Look around the complex. Is there a pharmacy around, a grocery store? This is critical especially if moving to a big city since you may not know the neighborhood well. Again, useful in emergencies",1211998268

202395,comment,201819,202306,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, you assume they are meant to be irritating because they irritate you, probably largely due to my use of the word ""fanboy"". If I had posted that article on an Apple Developer forum rather than my personal blog, that might be a reasonable assumption. Hell, if I even wrote it here, that might still have some validity (though I think not much) given that most people here probably use OSX.<p>But they're on a website whose URL is my real name. It should be pretty clear that I write for myself and people like me. I am of the opinion that much of the tech media is held in thrall by Steve Jobs and is abandoning their job of fair and balanced reporting because they want to have early access to new iPhones and iPods. (In fairness, I blame Jobs as much for having that policy as I do for them abiding by it.) So I write about it.<p>If that's irritating to you, don't read. But don't accuse me of trolling for simply expressing Matt Maroon's opinions on mattmaroon.com. That's very small-minded, and egocentric. No offense, but I don't care enough to spend my time irritating you.",1211998164

Well, that isn't cross platform you might say. However, Java mostly covers that and still it did not happen.  There are also numerous tools that allow you to write in one language (Java with GWT, some lisp one I cannot name) that runs on the server side that automatically generates equivalent javascript for the client.<p>There is no reason (and you provide no argument) that using the same code on the client/server results in decentralization. Furthermore, we have the fact that it already exists and still did not lead to decentralization.",1298362450

Nevertheless, I stand by my point that human readability does not necessarily imply easy human comprehension. For that matter I believe that the working group introduces that design goal to ease problem tracking and not to imply that xml is suitable for human to human communication (which imho should be the main design goal of computer languages). I have great respect for your mental abilities but for me its difficult to understand larger ant scripts as xml is a data container and not a control flow language.",1298361742

Originally they were offering it with the 15mb and 19mb ADSL 2+ profiles with a Thomson Speedtouch modem and a D-Link gateway or you could substitute your own router. When they moved to the VDSL2 profiles they started using the Actiontec VDSL modem/router combo which is a requirement.<p>There's no way to turn bridge mode on and the best you can do is turn on the DMZ and run your own router out of that. However, you're then double NAT'd which possibly could slow your connection down and it also allows the ISP to have a direct line into your personal network with wich they can mess any settings.<p>The main complaint is that the ISPs used to just own the line form the node to your modem and now they are DEMANDING to control your internal network as well which is a fucking joke.",1298361642

Fortunately, we are nowhere near saturating the capacity of our nodes under normal operation (we are only doing about 1,200 queries/second). We are also able to offload read-only queries to slaves that are replicating off of the masters, which should help with the read capacity, which is our biggest demand.",1310745591

2767856,comment,2766853,2766853,10,0,peteboyd,,,"Dealing with clients is all about setting expectations.  I really view our contracts as just the expectations codified and hopefully never read again.  The key is what the clients actually expect you to deliver.  If we ever have to turn to the contract language, we have already lost something in translation.<p>I wont go over all the articles points; I think it is well written.  I am a bit envious that they have a product to transition too. However, I will point out two ways to help small agencies deal with clients.  Specifically on how to take payments and whether to accept certain clients.  Both of these areas will help alleviate stress in running the business.<p>1.  Not getting paid.  To fix this issue simply demand more up front.  We start projects at 75% due.  Have done this for 10 years now.  Larger contracts, over $15,000, we will start with a 50%, 25%, 25% split. We have never started a project for less than 50% of the entire.<p>The key is that you never work on collection model.  Never send an invoice for work completed.  You always are working from your funds you have, so you are never at a loss.<p>Sure some clients balk at the higher up-front costs, but do you want those clients?  Stick to your guns.  If a client likes you and your portfolio, they probably will sign even if it means a bit more upfront costs.<p>2. Owning your time.  We get our fair share of ""interesting"" clients, but have found a way to weed them out in the sales process. This way we only work with clients that we like and want to help. Key tips that it will be a ""interesting"" project and you may want to pass:<p>- Wanting to change our standard contract.  Our contract is a short 1-page that is really fair to both sides.  The more they change the harder the project will be, always.  Stick to your contract.
- The client needs to start, now, now, now.  Basically someone internally has dropped a ball in scheduling and now it is your problem.  Charge more to help them or pass on the project.
- Disorganized email chains and hectic meetings.  The client won't suddenly become organized during the project, which means you are now their organizer.  Have fun with that project if you accept, but charge more for project management.<p>Anyways, I think going the product route is great for web agencies.  But you can make a successful agency model work and have fun, we have for 10 years now.",1310745397

2767845,comment,2766756,2767611,5,0,wnewman,,,"There's probably more to it than that. Humans do typically play Go on 19x19 boards, but Go is still relatively hard for computers (compared to Chess) even on smaller boards like 9x9, where the branching factor is reasonably comparable to Chess. And the branching factor in the kind of Go tactics problems collected as exercises in books for human players isn't that much larger than the branching factor in chess, either. Decades ago chess programmers could remark that their programs solved typical chess tactics problems faster than humans could turn the pages in the book. Even today solving typical Go tactics problems is somewhere between a very serious programming challenge and an open research question.<p>Broadly speaking the difficulties in Go tactics seem to be similar to the difficulties that computers have historically had in Chess endgame tactics, which clearly wasn't a problem of branching factor: branching goes down in the Chess endgame. (However, today there is an important dissimilarity: the space of Chess endgames is small enough that modern computers can tabulate the solution for a significant fraction of the problem space beforehand.)",1310745266

In real life you get together frequently to watch baseball on TV, go to ball games, etc. and primarily discuss baseball. That can be done on Facebook, but not yet on Google+.

The way to solve it is with a series of intermediate barters which cancel out, whose only purpose is to coordinate exchanges (I first give Z to B in exchange for Y, which I then trade for X with A).

2767778,comment,2767176,2767543,3,0,reirob,,,"Yes, this could be an explanation. But why would the Greek government provide the money to the banks? I mean they could invest the money (that they've got from EU and IWF) in infrastructure and economy and then declare default. If I understand it well Argentina was as well helped by IWF, but in the end they defaulted - and it seems like it was the right step. So I do not really understand what is the EU's interest to absolutely safe Greece from default? They are pumping more and more money at a time where many voices say that Greece will not be able to pay back. Even George Soros thinks: ""A Greek default may be inevitable but it need not be disorderly"" (<a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/43720940"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/id/43720940</a>).<p>So if you could explain, why is it important for the banking system to be able to handle a Greek default? I mean throughout the financial crisis everybody is saying that it is absolutely important to save the banking system - every politician repeats this like a parrot. But why? Most of the middle/lower class population in Europe does not have spare money in a bank account but in contrary has debts for housing or other stuff. And I would guess that this is by far more than 80% of population. These people would not necessarily suffer from banks collapsing, but they are suffering from the economic cuts that the governments are doing everywhere in order to save banks - who are actually responsible because they did not mitigate the risk and triggered the subprime crisis.<p>So if you have a good explanation, please share with me.",1310744473

2767776,story,,,2,2,chaselanc,"Forget Greece, Save Italy",http://chaselanc.com/post/7029017575,"It seems the Greek fiasco is headlining just about every newspaper and magazine these days.  Europe and countries around the world are focused in on how Greece can finance the next few years of its government and how it can do so without defaulting.  To be sure, a Greek default would have massive consequences worldwide.  But it seems many politicians and investors have overlooked other countries that seem to be in pretty bad shape too.  Enter Italy.  Moodys has recently indicated that it may downgrade Italys debt due to macroeconomic structural weaknesses and the surrounding economic turmoil of its neighbors.  Just last Thursday, Moodys said it might downgrade 13 Italian banks if the the countrys rating is cut.  Most people might consider taking Italys warnings more seriously for the following reasons.  Italy has experienced decades of declining productivity and poor growth.  2008 and 2009 GDP declined by 1.3% and 5.2%, respectively.  The unemployment rate is 8.3% and youth unemployment is 29%.  The nations debt load of 1.8 trillion euros makes it the 4th highest public debtor in the world.  And while having debt isnt a bad thing, it is when your GDP is sluggish - resulting in a debt/GDP ratio of 120% (compare that to Greeces of 140% and 2x that of Spains).  Beyond the sluggish growth and high debt load, Italy, like Greece, has a number of problems that make solving these issues quite difficult.  For example, collecting taxes seems to be uncharacteristically hard.  It is estimated that Italy will lose 120 billion from tax evasion in 2011 (not a typo).  Compare that to Greece - 15 billion a year.  While Italys Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti is widely credited with shielding Italy from the global economic crisis, it seems a little premature to consider Italy a success story.  As Berlusconi loses his political grip on a country he has ruled for 17 years, Italys annus horriblis seems to be just getting started.",1310744460

We have a lot more customers. Before one or two of our web designer clients could hold us ransom over a big cheque - the sort of thing we needed to make payroll. Now we'd need a mass exodus of customers for the same to happen, and usually that would be because <i>we</i> screwed something up (i.e. it's fair).<p>2. Customers now have clearer expectations. Web design customers can expect all sort of things which they consider reasonable, and don't understand why they're not (e.g. supporting a website 5 years after you built it, changing their business fundamentally mid project, expecting 'as many designs as it takes' to get right etc). I know you can and should educate your customers, but essentially you're dissatisfying them. With products, generally people pay a fixed amount to use a thing for a time. If it doesn't work, we refund them. Simpler and happier all round.<p>I totally agree with your last point - if you can scale it pays better.

If I happened to be writing an e-mail and I got an @-reply on Twiiter with a notification, pressing back after reading the tweet should throw me right back to writing the e-mail.<p>I said it in yesterday's thread and I'll say it again here: the back button IS NOT an up button. Bad applications will attempt to ""re-create"" their internal stack of intents when you jump directly into a middle intent (like reading a Tweet or an e-mail), which breaks the back button's functionality. The author touched upon this in his post. A good analogy is Twitter's hash-bang urls breaking the back button in your browser. In this scenario Android's native Gmail app does it right: clicking back from a notification does NOT bring you to your inbox: it brings you right back into whatever you were doing.<p>Lazy app developers will try to shoe-horn ""up"" functionality into the back button. They're doing it wrong. What's the proper way to do this? The menu button and/or an on-screen UI element. If you're reading an e-mail and hit menu, there's a quick link to jump to your inbox. Other apps choose to use a button of sorts on the header or title area of their application.

Anyway the running of these deficits _does_ need to be curbed. It's clear that Greece has been pretty terrible at collecting taxes and managing it's finances. Even now with ""Austerity"" the UK is still spending 4 for every 3 it earns. Austerity just means ""slow the increase in debt"". In fact it's prob not even a first-order change, but second order: slow the rate of increase!<p>Edit: don't know why you've been dv'd, your point is absolutely relevant.",1310742227

To solve that you might need to epoxy a wireless transmitter into one of the ports and pair it with mice/keyboards as needed.  But for situations where wireless devices are not allowable, I can't see any cheap solution short of soldering the USB wires to the motherboard.  Damn USB for being so... universal.",1310742173

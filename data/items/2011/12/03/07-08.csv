One of the points of some of the exercises was to show that communication is more complicated than the seemingly a priori rules.  Human languages are <i>not</i> formal systems.<p>It's actually pretty easy with spoken language to completely mangle the rules and not only be understood but be even more evocative; that's how languages evolve.<p>It's more complicated with written words, but certainly possible.<p>One trick is to make up a completely new rule and ""teach"" it to the reader.  Another is to create a pattern and then break it for effect.  The results can be nonsensical, but quite meaningful.<p>Not something you might use in an everyday report or memo, but a good tool and a great way to de-provincialize language.<p>BTW, your ""Cat mouse mouse run run."" sentence can be made intelligible by inflection rather easily.  In English nouns and verbs can often double as adjectives and adverbs. With a little preparation a reader can be made to ""hear"" the inflection and understand the meaning.<p>Try and puzzle this out:<p>((Cat mouse) (mouse run) run)<p>Loose meaning is something like: The catlike mouse runs with a mouselike gait.<p>Tarzan explaining something obvious to an idiot big game hunter...<p>(The movie Tarzan, though.

Academic research is, almost by definition, solving problems that people will not yet pay for (I say this having been a graduate student and professor, and now in the startup game).<p>I'd encourage you to think about what marketable problems you are well-equipped to solve, rather than thinking about what you can do to sell your pre-existing research. The former is the essence of a startup and the latter is, on average, a recipe for disappointment.<p>On the legal matters: the University will almost certainly license the idea to you. Universities are not in the business of business, so just holding the patent is not particularly useful to them. They <i>want</i> someone to go out and start a business around the idea. You would be a good candidate for that. There is essentially no chance that they won't license it to you if you are credibly starting a business around it (though they'll probably want some kind of stake in the company). This is exactly the situation Google has: Stanford owns the PageRank patent and licenses it to Google in return for (I believe) a portion of Google's early stock.",1322898228

3307165,comment,3306364,3306364,1,0,icarus_drowning,,,"An interesting note: Mike Schmoker's book <i>Focus</i> addresses most of the points raised both in Seliger's and pg's essays; indeed, he comes to many of the same conclusions that Seliger does, recommending heavy doses of close readings of texts as a ""jumping off"" point for learning how to write. It also mirrors a lot of pg's thoughts in that it stresses the incorporation of argumentative writing as well.<p>I'd highly recommend Schmoker for anyone who's interested in these issues, whatever your opinion of these articles:<p><a href=""http://www.ascd.org/Publications/Authors/Mike-Schmoker.aspx?id=772617157001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ascd.org/Publications/Authors/Mike-Schmoker.aspx?...</a><p>I use most of Schmoker's methods even in my music classes, where students are consistently asked to write about the music they are learning, as well as to learn how to take a position about that music (e.g., ""the woodwinds are not properly used in this piece <i>because</i>..."") in addition to the more ""dry, academic"" writing (research papers on the Baroque era, etc). I've had a <i>lot</i> of success by simply following Schmoker's recommendations, which are almost universally applicable across the humanities.",1322896121

I guess what it boils down to is how frequently the nodes report their status back to the master (or whatever its called) so that it can determine which operations have succeeded and which are still pending/failed.<p>I wonder how much of a tax it takes to report the result of each operation sequentially vs. doing it in a batch at the end of the segment. If the difference in performance is because Hadoop reports sequential while sector does it batched, be nice to have something that gives you a sliding bar to chose somewhere along the gradient between failover optimization and optimistic optimization where your failovers are far and few in between.",1255967992

890274,comment,889516,889516,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"Part of the reason Java's documentation is so ""good"" is that it needs to be. If you want to know the length of an array, it's .length (carefully avoiding parenthesis), for a Vector, it's .size(). For Vector's, there's also .capacity() which is different from size. Then there's setSize() and trimToSize(), one of which affects size (and capacity) and one of which just affects capacity. Then you have ensureCapacity() and isEmpty() which do things you could easily check on your own.<p>In Python, the way to tell how long anything is is the len() function. There is no concept of capacity because there's no reason to care. If you want to check if a list is empty, you just say ""if list_variable"". Once you learn those two basic concepts, which apply to the entire Python library, you never need to look at documentation for sizes and capacities of anything again.<p>Python's slice notation replaces an overloaded add(), elementAt(), firstElement(), get(), insertElementAt(), lastElement(), remove(), removeAllElements(), removeElement(), removeRange(), set(), setElementAt(), and subList(). And it works the same for all list-like objects in Python. Java's copious documentation on those functions (some of which are exact duplicates) is not a good thing. It's a sign of a serious design problem.",1255967090

890270,comment,889928,889928,0,0,zck,,,"One of the downsides of taking less time to graduate is requiring earlier decisions. Many students don't graduate with their major unchanged from what they thought it at the time they matriculated. Personally, by the time my freshman year was over, I had taken only three courses total in what would become my two majors (math and computer science), and one didn't count (C.S. for non-majors). I had no idea what I wanted to major in when I went to college. I needed that time to decide. Of course, moving one year of college into  summers would make for the same amount of work each semester, but temporally compressed, at the cost of removing all your intra-college summers. No summer internships, no summer jobs. That means you can't go work for google; you can't work for Fog Creek. You can get an internship during school, but that won't be full-time; just a day or two a week. For many students, they'll be away from their families for most of those three years, which would consist of nearly-constant work.",1255966956

It's been a while so I don't remember all the details, but I'll roughly sketch out how it works.<p>Year 1: Calc 1 during the summer, calc 2 fall, calc 3 and 4 concurrently in the spring. Take other standard intro courses (Physics 1-2, Chem 1-2). Goal of year 1: make sure no prereq requirement stops you from doing year 2.<p>Year 2: Basic senior level/grad courses (quantum mechanics, math methods, functional analysis) and whatever other grad courses are offered. Fill in distribution requirements.<p>Year 3: Whatever other senior/grad courses I missed and fill in assorted distribution requirements (literature, intro prob&stat, etc).<p>I think the main trick is to take hard courses first. Then you can load up on credits without doing much work (my senior year I took 36 credits, which was nowhere near twice as much work as 18 credits). For example, stat mech (in year 2) was hard. Thermo took about 4 hours of work: 2 hours refreshing stat mech before each test.<p>(For those who weren't physics majors, statistical mechanics == derive thermodynamics from first principles.)<p>In short, it's doable. You need to know your major and plan ahead, but it's eminently doable. The hardest part is fighting with the beaurocrats who will try to stop you.",1255965665

1. Droid specs on phandroid (and other sites) include WiFi and GPS. Given Verizon's involvement with the phone's development it would (at the very least) strange if they crippled them. Also, do you think Google would have been involved with Droid (as opposed to letting Verizon run with the open-source code on their own) if they knew Verizon was going to cripple it?<p>2. How long would it take Apple to mercilessly expose the ""iDon't"" marketing campaign if the iPhone has features (WiFi and GPS) that Droid doesn't?<p>3. I remember reading (sadly, I don't remember where) that all future Blackberrys on Verizon will include WiFi. If that's accurate, Verizon must be softening on WiFi and there's no good reason to cripple Droid out-of-the-gate. In fact, I wonder if Droid's WiFi is what gave Blackberry the leverage to insist on WiFi for their phones as well.",1255965424

And now, my arguments about why he is not the best programmer.<p>1) djb software is not the most elegant software around at all. Actually trying to write high performance and bug free software his style is the most procedural possible, with very little abstractions layers.<p>2) his software is well known to be uneasy to configure. There are qmail hackers around. When there are <name of a unix deamon>-hackers around it's a bad sign about the quality of the interface between the program and the rest of the system and the system administrator itself.<p>3) Djb played no role at all in the programming languages world. AFAIK he never suggested some new idea for programming languages or new directions that are now considered important. You can't be <i>the best</i> without being influential in the field.<p>4) Djb newer wrote big systems that were crucial for the programming world. Qmail and djbdns can disappear tomorrow and everything will be up and running anyway. GCC or the Linux Kernel are a different matter.<p>I can continue, but I think 1+2+3+4 are already enough to deny the argument aaronsw is trying to push in the article.",1255965056

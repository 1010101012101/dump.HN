You don&#x27;t even get function calls - the templates work under many circumstances, but not all (and are a pain to debug).\nAlso don&#x27;t get me started on invisible syntax errors (tabs vs spaces), and the only error message Make has&#x27; Missing separator. Stop&#x27;.<p>Writing a build system in Python loses you that concise declaration syntax (but again characters typed isn&#x27;t everything, as long as you maintain clarity it doesn&#x27;t matter), but gets you ugh more flexibility to produce rules under complex circumstances, which saw at you need for portability.",1392195305

It also contains most of the distro specific stuff outside of init.d, opening the door for lots more reuse.<p>But if you&#x27;re an upstream developer and wants to ship sys-v init scripts, nobody has the power to stop you. Downstream will either simply write a systemd init file, or you might choose to add one if you like, or if you put LSB comments in your sys-v init file downstream might opt to use that with Systemd if they want to.<p>How exactly is upstream being forced to do anything?<p>How exactly are distribution developers being forced?

Nor do I have the interest in becoming the consultant or startup route. For me, the coolest to do is to contribute to open source projects, lean programming languages/Linux Kernel/Bioinformatics/ML etc. for fun; I&#x27;d love to find the right balance of doing either menial work or mindless web dev work without being too taxing to fund my own personal interests; and am willing to be basically work at an livable income (40K in a big metro).<p>Recently a gentleman mentioned on a thread that he is doing indie game development while working at a Target warehouse. I&#x27;d love to hear people who are have gone down this route or have the same mindset. Do you guys work say half a year doing consulting and half a year on your own stuff? Or do you guys work at a menial job and work on your free mental capacities after work. Or do you work at a menial web dev job or at a company that offers &quot;summer hours&quot; (4 day 10-hour weeks) or flex-time and work on cool stuff after work. Would love to hear some of your thoughts and journey should you have gone down this path.",1392192496

Without that tying, we already have (known, tested) tools that cover most of these features.<p>This is the argument we&#x27;ve heard over and over again.<p>The problem with traditional unix init scripts, together with cron, acpid, inetd, etc is that you need a big brittle mess of shell scripts to tie it all together to form a system that actually works.<p>While the traditional approach may work alright for a static setup like a server that is booted once and stays on forever, it&#x27;s not good enough for a desktop, laptop or mobile device. There may be changes in power (mains/battery/low power), network connectivity (ethernet, wifi, mobile) and connecting peripherals (including external disks) and lots of other things which need starting/stopping services or mounting/unmounting partitions. The amount of shell script glue to make these things work is unwieldy and doesn&#x27;t really work that well.<p>And distribution maintainers have to make a choice, supporting more than one init system is going to be a burden that will hurt end users in the long run.<p>Finally, no one is forcing <i>you</i> to use a systemd based distribution. If OpenRC solves <i>your</i> problems, do go ahead and use Gentoo or another OpenRC based system.",1392192369

This lends credence to the idea that it isn&#x27;t merely the quantity of food availability, but its unnatural palatability that makes people overeat.<p><a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/3/665.full?ijkey=f7644b482b3a3375f7ca3c77e4cfe27640bdae83&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/3/665.full?ijkey=f7644b...</a>",1392192314

There is great educational value in being in a class which has different levels.<p>If you are smarter: learning to help others, working together with people that are slower than you are, learning that usually intelligence is not one-dimensional and kids that are not very good at math might be great at writing…<p>If you are less smart the benefits are across the board. I remember reading a study about mixing kids from different incomes in the same school as opposed to wealth segregation (you might argue that smarts and wealth are not the same, but they are often highly correlated at least when starting out) and the conclusions were that there was no drawback for the rich kids, but huuuge advantages for the poorer.",1392192282

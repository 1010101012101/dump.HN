917000,comment,916737,916900,0,0,noste,,,"<i>Comparing Norc to batch is similar to comparing it to cron. Many of the limitations of batch processing come with retrying or auditing complex trees of dependencies (bigger than a handful of tasks).</i><p>Condor has DAGMan (<a href=""http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/dagman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/dagman/</a>) for managing DAGs of jobs, and I suspect that it can scale higher than just a handful of tasks.<p><i>I believe resource management is limited to overall system load. Batch isn't designed for things like managing available licenses.</i><p>Condor acts as match maker for jobs and cluster nodes using ""classified advertisements"" (<a href=""http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/classad/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/classad/</a>). Classads allow you to describe the jobs and the cluster nodes, and to express arbitrary requirements and preferences for both. This allows jobs to say ""I need a node with X"", but it also allows nodes to express requirements (e.g. ""I won't any run jobs coming from the psych department""). I don't see why you couldn't use this system for expressing requirements regarding licenses.<p>However, Condor appears to be <i>very</i> complex. The PDF version of the Condor 7.3 manual has 991 pages in it. OTOH, Red Hat MRG Grid is based on Condor (<a href=""http://www.redhat.com/mrg/grid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redhat.com/mrg/grid/</a>), so commercial support should be available.",1257177554

And it might be just one of those things that I have somehow missed during all my time coding QBASIC, VBA, C++, C, Ruby, Python, etc...<p>Most of the time when you are writing an if statement, you are comparing a mutable variable to something constant (i.e. variable to string, variable to integer, variable to symbol), so you can avoid the assignment-instead-of-comparison bug by writing constant == variable instead of variable == constant. This way if you forget one of the equals signs you'll get a syntax error. The key with this is you have to get in the habit of doing it and do it all the time, so that you don't have a false sense of security. \nSo instead of:<p>if foo.to_str == ""hi everyone!\n""<p><pre><code>  puts ""hello there!""  \n</code></pre>\nend<p>use<p>if ""hi everyone!\n"" == foo.to_str<p><pre><code>  puts ""hello there!""  \n</code></pre>\nend",1257177472
916998,comment,916532,916842,0,0,jerf,,,"""What biological advantage does a large family have over a small family in an affluent society?""<p>The <i>definition</i> of biological advantage is having a large number of offspring rather than a small one! (Simplifying a bit; said offspring should also reproduce, recursively, but it's a decent approximation to just consider offspring.) What kind of weird question is that?<p>Also, to bundle a reply to another of your concerns, of course you don't observe changes yet. If you have one population averaging 3 children per couple and another of equal size averaging 1, in the first generation it may not look like that big a deal, but by the fourth or fifth generation the 1-child-per-couple group has been effectively eliminated as a significant part of the population. Surprisingly small differences magnify surprisingly rapidly across generations; evolutionists have observed species going extinct because of far smaller differences than that. I just used large numbers to make the point more understandable, it applies equally to 2.1 children vs 2.15, it just takes a few more generations in that case... and not even <i>all</i> that many.",1257177469

The number (2<i></i>-256) gives much more comfort than saying:<p>If you hash 4KiB-long blocks, then every possible block will share the hash value with (on average) 128 different 4KiB blocks. And on a standard 200GiB disk you can fit (more or less) 52,400,000 blocks.<p>This explanation is a bit less reassuring. Now consider the fact that your data is never random and you hit the same patterns all the time (loads of zeros / ascii letters / x86 code)",1257175399

I should note that I am in the market for this service and only gave them the extra time I did, because of that.  Were I a more idle visitor, that back button would have had skid marks on it.

Literacy rate in the USA is a poor proxy for ""education"" because it's just too basic (you can be considered literate in American English and still have only a fourth-grade education) and is covered by the universal primary education system that we've had for years. The US population has grown largely through immigration since 1850, which makes it misleading to attribute changes in literacy rate directly to trends in childhood education. And, even apart from that, the major factor in the US literacy rate from 1850 to the present is likely to be the difference in education available to different subsets of the population, and the relative sizes of these subsets:<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp</a><p>In 1870 80% of the black population was illiterate, presumably because it was composed of former slaves who had generally been forbidden to learn to read.

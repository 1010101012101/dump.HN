8052425,comment,8050144,8050649,6,0,morkbot,,,"James Long from Mozilla has his answer for this:<p><i>Aren&#x27;t you tired of having to query the DOM tree and manually manage the structure to create UIs? Web Components doesn&#x27;t solve this at all, it just tries to encapsulate the work. The problem is that building apps is building components, so you inevitably are forced back into the manual DOM management to create your app-specific components (like how you constantly have to create directives in Angular). You also need to jump into JavaScript to configure and wire up any Web Components you used. It&#x27;s a very messy abstraction, and fools you into desiring a pure HTML-based declarative way to write apps, which is like wanting steak but eating liver.</i><p>See <a href=""http://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-...</a>",1405681176

Sure they are much heavier and saver, but overall fuel consumption is not much improved.<p>You should also calculate energy needed to produce and maintain the car. Wartburg engine has only 7 moving parts and can be disassembled and fixed with screw-driver. Most modern cars are thrown away after 10 years, because it is too expensive to maintain them.<p>I think we could easily reduce energy consumption 5x by making simplier and lighter cars.

However, I can also walk into a pharmacy here (Ireland) and explain to them that I&#x27;m an asthmatic, and need a releiver inhaler. They will give an &quot;emergency&quot; inhaler, (same inhaler, no questions asked) over the counter and ask me nicely to go to the doctor for the next one.<p>You&#x27;re probably an edge case. The vast majority of people who are ordering from online pharmacies are doing so because they think they know what they&#x27;re doing, and because they feel X or Y, they should take Z. This isn&#x27;t really a problem with inhalers per se, because the amount of them you are required to ingest is actually pretty damn high before you are in any danger, but for stuff like prescription painkillers, people are self medicating and avoiding doctors visits for issues that they should be seeing a professional for.",1405678899

Malaysia Airlines said that after the crash it immediately altered its flight paths, while other airlines either did likewise or emphasised they had already been taking alternative routes.<p>&quot;With immediate effect, all European flights operated by Malaysia Airlines will be taking alternative routes avoiding the usual route,&quot; said a statement from the airline.

Essentially they become low interest loans at that point. Investors would obviously prefer to have equity in the company and equity at a seed stage level might place pre-mature valuation on the company that is often disadvantageous.<p>If you expect to be profitable and do not wish to raise, venture debt or other means of capitals might make more sense. Alternatively being profitable does not mean you shouldn&#x27;t raise. Raising capital helps with bringing on board investors and mentors you otherwise lack access to, capital to accelerate growth, etc.<p>Unless you expect insane growth and profit without the need of new capital, chances are anyone investing would want the company to scale up quite large.<p>Again, as a disclaimer, I am not an investor but this is just what I understand being in the startup game for some time.",1405677625

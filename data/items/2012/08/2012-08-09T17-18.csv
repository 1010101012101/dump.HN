Consider that the CEO of Chase National Bank, one Albert Wiggin, was caught secretly selling short his bank's stock in 1929, at the same time he was committing his bank's money to buying the bank's shares, and he did this through a Canadian shell company to avoid US taxes.[1]  Or consider that the Chairman of the NY Stock Exchange, one Richard Whitney, was sent to jail at Sing-Sing for embezzlement in 1938.[2]<p>The forced separation of commercial and investment banks by Glass-Steagall in 1933, the creation of the SEC in 1934, and the enactment of many investor- and market-protection laws and regulations via the Investment Company act of 1940, were all a response to the Crash of 1929 and the resulting Great Depression.  The underlying assumption behind all these efforts was that Wall Street could not be left to its own devices.<p>The country subsequently had decades of relative financial market stability: there were no crashes like 1929 until the regulatory apparatus was dismantled in the 1980's and 1990's, leading to the crisis of 2008.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Wiggin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Wiggin</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Whitney_%28financier%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Whitney_%28financier%29</a>",1344535180

You get back a token to reference to make the actual charges in the future. You don't have to do an authorization up front. Virtually every payment gateway has such a feature. There's no need to implement storage on your own and take on the compliance burdens.<p>If you use SpreedlyCore, for example, you point your signup/billing form to their server, which stores the card data then redirects back to your site, so the user never sees anything but your site yet the payment data never hits your server. If you use Stripe, for example, the form submission gets intercepted by JavaScript that sends it to Stripe instead of your server, then returns a token in a callback. If you use services like these, there's virtually no compliance burden at all.<p>> Then, you have the issue as to whether or not the card has the amount available in the future when you intend to charge it...<p>You'd have that issue whether you used a 3rd party processor or your own merchant account. Amazon Payments wouldn't have given them money when the customers' cards had no funds either.<p>BTW: There is no PCI-DSS or PA-DSS level that allows storing of verification codes, for either businesses or payment software companies. The whole point of that code is that it's never stored.",1344535143

Heck, I was outraged I even blogged about it.<p>However, I'd like to play devil's advocate for a moment. A few weeks ago, the Ryan Holiday fiasco went public. If you don't remember this, he was the guy who lied his way into coverage in mainstream media (ie - ABC, MSNBC, the New York Times, etc.) This was a situation where journalists didn't check their own facts (in this case, they didn't vet their expert) and they printed lies.<p>A few months ago, ABC tweeted that Hosni Mubarak had died. Turns out he was still alive (and it took journalists about twenty minutes to figure that out).<p>Journalists are in the business of fact checking, yet they've been caught many, many times unknowingly spreading hoaxes. Social media is incredibly powerful (now), but it will become useless if we don't teach civilians how to check their facts before they start lynch mobs.<p>Anyone have any ideas how we can guide users towards showing some restraint in similar situations?",1344535131

4362287,comment,4361390,4361449,16,0,breckinloggins,,,"OK, so I've been looking through the code and from what I see I suspect a big reason for the rewrite was to move huge chunks into platform-independent C++ for an ultimate Win32/Linux/Mac trifecta release (maybe for TM3).  If so, this would explain why things got so bogged down.<p>The actual layout/folding code, for example, is in C++.  When it needs to draw it calls Core Graphics C functions.  A lot of the other things like commands are similarly abstracted.  But the thing is, if you look in Frameworks/layout/src/layout.cc for example (the code that actually lays out the text), it looks like nice platform-independent C++ code.  Ah, you think, this will be easy!  Until you get to, say, CGRect layout_t::rect_for (row_tree_t::iterator rowIter).  The return type is CGRect and it's calling CGRectMake.  These are Mac-specific Core Graphics calls.  The drawing code is similarly Mac-specific.<p>So the first thing you'd need to do is follow the architecture and start TRULY abstracting the core functionality into these C++ classes and, when they make a call to something platform-specific, you'll need to replace it with something platform-independent.<p>To do this, you'll need to:<p>- Make or move to an abstracted Graphics Context library.  You could use something like Cairo or roll your own (which is what WebKit does).<p>- Further abstract the application structure away from the actual classes.  So, for example, you would have platform neutral code to talk about the UI logically but then have each ""MyWindow"" C/C++ class hold a ""PlatformWindowHandle"" which, on Linux might be a GTKWindow pointer, on Win32 might be a Window HANDLE or COM object reference to a .NET Window, and on Mac be a pointer to an NSWindow.  You'd obviously need similar platform-neutral library infrastructure to call into each of these with a similar API and translate to the platform actually running at the bottom.  You could write this yourself, or you could maybe just use wxWidgets or some other library that's had a decade-long head start.  You lose some control that way, though.<p>- Repeat with all other areas of the app that are still Mac-specific.<p>My opinion is this would be a good starting point for such a thing, and if you really wanted to make it happen you could.  But you're NOT going to just go in there and replace NSWindows with GTKWindows and NSButtons with GTKButtons and call it a day.  It will be MUCH more work than that.",1344535096

They make up a large percentage of their yearly income and don't even offer any kind of support beyond automated responses.  Amazon also doesn't keep the same standard of service as their sellers.<p>They have bots that will auto-ban your account with no recourse.<p>If a customer complains, they get their money back in 99% of the cases (even if it's > 1 year later) without ever having to return the item (I got scammed by many customers this way).  Amazon also has no way of banning a customer, so they can keep doing it, leaving you negative feedback, and their bots will auto-ban you (good luck getting it un-banned after this happens).  So you end up losing all of the money and the item you sold.<p>If I buy an ipad and complain, Amazon (If I'm buying from Amazon.com..and not a 3rd party seller) will make me return it before I get a refund.<p>I was a seller for many years and finally called it quits.

Micropayments and free to play games are moving from the fringe to the default and this is terrible for gaming. It's terrible because it forces companies to become zyngafied.

There's no ""there"" there.""<p>You could say the same thing in reverse: it's just opting out of the pro-college dogma.<p>Colleges have a huge amount of overhead like land, buildings, bureaucracy and enticements like fancy campuses and perks; much of it for students studying soft subjects with a lot of grade inflation. It's all paid for by government incentives and a trillion dollars in student loan debt.<p>A lot of studies say that college degrees are still worth the cost, but I'd like to know if such studies control for the self-selection of college students. Is it that college puts people on the path toward success or that people on the path toward success tend to choose college? Also, do the various majors independently justify their costs, or are political science majors lumped with engineers?<p>Today, I'd still probably choose college if I were 18 again (in engineering or one of a few other subjects). But ten years from now, I hope there are better alternatives available (which will make the colleges better, too), and college will just be one option that can survive without government subsidy.<p>Such a change will also improve the liberal arts and soft subjects at colleges. Right now, such subjects are diluted by a lot of people that just don't know what to do, and think that those subjects are easier and leave more time to party. When those people are no longer encouraged by easy money and enticed by fancy campuses, or fear the stigma of not going to college, then the softer subject classes will be left with serious thinkers.",1344534684

Wired regularly comes out with these neo-luddite articles.  The reality is, software bugs cause money.  Knight was punished for their ""sins"".<p>Meanwhile I profit because HFT makes the market more efficient for me.  I know this with certainty because I trade derivatives (options spreads) and I've done so in areas where there is no HFT and where there is a lot of HFT.  My orders go better at closer prices when there's HFT going on.  I've experienced the additional market liquidity first hand, and the underlying is shockingly stable for the nature of the business, so I don't think anyone could say that HFT is destabilizing the stock price.<p>At this point people might be tempted to shout ""anecdote"" but the thing is, economics and reason also support this view. Thinly traded markets are simply less price efficient because there are less people analyzing price and thus willing to buy or sell at a little better price. Computers are efficient at this (I know almost all the counter parties to my trades are computers, it is really easy to see because they react instantaneously to my actions.)<p>Finally let me point something out.  Facebooks IPO has been pretty poor, while Google's was great. Google was able to go public when it was still in its high growth phase.  This meant that the public was able to invest in google and make very high returns.  Facebook, however, grew up in a different regulatory environment, especially after 2008 (Which was itself a result of regulation in the first place, though for political reasons we're fed a constant stream of lies to the contrary) ... in this regulatory environment going public is much more difficult.<p>Thus, instead of you and me profiting from buying facebook stock in 2006, where we would be up 100-fold by now, only venture capitalists and large companies were allowed to participate in that.  This is really a shame.  In the 1990s a company like facebook would have gone public much earlier.  People seem to think that because there was a bubble (again government created) and some companies went bust that somehow magically ""regulation"" will ""protect"" people.  It doesn't, it just hurts people.  We all missed out on Facebook, and now facebook was forced into a situation where its stock is going to suck wind for awhile-- hurting the entire startup sector.<p>But it always starts with articles like this-- nonsense to scare people about HFT, this creates the political support for legislation (which always favors certain interests, not the least of which are the politicians who wouldn't do it otherwise) at the expense of society.",1344534251

Yes, that's correct. There is no global dipole magnetic field on Mars [1]. However there are weak fields ""frozen"" into some of the oldest rocks on Mars [2], which indicates that the planet did have a global magnetic field at some point in its early history. Scientists think that the lack of a global magnetic field was part of the reason that Mars lost its atmosphere. [3]<p>For humans to settle on Mars and stay for any length of time, we will need to find a way to shield ourselves from the ionizing radiation that reaches the surface.

You could dial in to a terminal and then connect to any of the local machines.  Most were VAX/VMS or Ultrix systems.  The VMS systems all had open GUEST accounts that were limited, but allowed you access to BITNET.  I managed to chat with Taran King, who was co-editor of Phrack at the time, a few times over the BITNET chat protocol which was great fun.<p>However, my actually hacking life started on the Ultrix systems.  I don't remember how I first had access since I don't think it allowed Guest logins, but I discovered a great hack:  all of /dev/tty* was word-readable until someone fully logged in to a particular port at which point it was only readable by the user logged into that port.  so every few hours, I'd just ""cat /dev/tty* >> passwords.txt"" and harvest logins for everyone who logged in during that time.  I had some fun with one of the admins for awhile having unknowingly logged into his account.  We chatted a bit and he was a good sport about it, but the hole was patched a few weeks after.  I never knew if it was already a known issue or if I was actually the only one who found it.<p>A friend wardialed a system that appeared to be a Dept of Transportation front-end to the brand-new digital readerboards along the Interstate.  Let's assume we never actually changed any text, but I cracked the password, TRAFFIC, on the 3rd or 4th attempt.  Good one, guys!<p>Exploring random address on TELENET dialups was a blast as well.

4362126,comment,4360829,4361853,5,0,Jd,,,"I would argue that the problematic conflation exists in the original program, insofar as the 20 under 20 program is often described as a potential replacement for higher ed. As far as I see things, there are a whole bunch of extra factors which are much more extensive than your three categories and which require a much more rigorous analysis.<p>For example, how do we foster innovation in specific subjects?  For instance, we presumably know that with respect to atomic physics, this requires highly knowledgable people who have spent a lifetime studying very abstract subject matter, and this is most likely to be facilitated by institutions not governed by a profit motive. This is not quite as clear for innovation with respect to alternative energy, which may require any of the following: developing new types of energy, developing the technology which employs the new type of energy, or bringing an existing technology to market.  The skillsets required for all of these areas are different, as is the institutional setting in which they will foster. If you take a very brilliant person who could ostensibly be working on harnessing new potential energy from the atom and put him in a program focused on entrepreneurship this would be a total mis-utilization of talent and, consequently, a  huge step backwards. This is to say that business and entrepreneurship are only a solution for a certain set of problems and these are not the only problems.<p>Also, certain subject areas require super-specialization. So you need to start early and stay focused. The means for doing this will probably depend on what the subject area is. Is ""higher ed"" the solution for a would-be master electrician? No, probably some combination of vocational school and apprenticeship is. Likewise for a pianist. You go to a specialized school for a specialized subject.<p>Standard higher ed is an easy whipping boy insofar as it is often the default solution for many people who don't know what they want to do with their lives, many of whom don't actually end up taking advantage of the resources available to them and learning all that much. In a certain sense this might be a fault of the institutions themselves, including massive inflation in costs, multiplication of institutions, and failure to actually teach anything of value. However, the fact remains that for certain cases, there are no obvious better options than higher ed.<p>In any case, I think higher ed should be looked at as a set of tools rather than a solution to a specific problem, least of all the question ""what should I do with the next four years of my life?"" If you look at it that way, you might find that the tools that are available for you, including potentially interacting with a number of bright and diverse people and broadening your experience in various unexpected ways will be beneficial in many ways.<p>Case in point: I was chatting with a professor at Harvard yesterday who studied French and German before focusing on Arabic, and he was lamenting the fact that he had not had the chance to study more Sanskrit (he did study a bit) or Urdu or get his Persian up to snuff, all of which he though would have deepened his understanding and approach to life, which have some relationship to his scholarship. Of course, all of these things take time, and usually they take some form of institutional support, but as far as I see it they can be valuable if they expose you to certain ways of thinking about the world that you might not experience otherwise.<p>For that reason, I think you are right about entrepreneurship as a possible thing to do alongside your studies or even to replace your studies, but it very much depends on the person and where they are trying to go with their life. There are a lot of very hard problems that cannot be solved in the context of a startup and indicating to the youth that this is the best option may deprive them of valuable life experience.<p>As for the specific question of age, I agree that there is no set time to do anything in life. There are, however, natural patterns, insofar as people are not usually ready to leave the home and exist on their own until sometime in their late teens. What they do at that point probably should depend on their talent and proclivities. In that sense, I do think that Thiel's initiative may be right for some people. It is, nonetheless, billed as a solution for all sorts of problems for which it is not (much like the gazillion online education initiatives).",1344533255

I did actually meet you once, although you won't remember :-)  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IXI_Limited"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IXI_Limited</a><p>I will say that the techpubs group at SCO did a heck of a lot of work.  SCO Unix distinguished itself from other Unix versions by being very friendly, even for administrators. In theory you could do everything from the GUI.  And of course that also meant comprehensive usable documentation.  SCO was the first company to license the NCSA Mosaic browser, with SCO's techpubs group using it for online help.  In IXI we went way further than that, including adding scripting (TCL) and making it possible to combine help and preferences.<p>Many people do not know how SCO's business worked.  When computers were a lot more expensive (think fridge sized boxes with a minimum cost of $100k) they weren't practical for small businesses (eg a dentist's office).  There were 15,000 VARs who you could call if you were a small business and they'd bring in a several thousand dollar computer (typically Compaq), some terminals, tape backup system, the operating system (SCO) and software for managing the office.  Since they usually charged a percentage of the goods, it didn't matter if the Unix cost $1,000.  It was that side of things Caldera wanted to get into, rather than selling for $19 a copy at a store.<p>For many years if you wanted to run a pet cemetery, then the only management software was on SCO Unix.",1344532802

        *to = *from++;
    }while(--n>0);

This is almost the same as Duff's code without the switch statement.  It's a simple unrolled loop that copies 8 words per iteration.<p>Next, consider how to handle a <i>count</i> that is not a multiple of 8.  You could simply add a loop that copies a single word at a time, but to avoid the overhead of a loop, you could instead use a <i>switch</i> statement, making use of C's fallthrough behavior when omitting the <i>break</i> after each <i>case</i>:<p><pre><code>    switch (count%8) {
    case 7: *to = *from++;
    case 6: *to = *from++;
    case 5: *to = *from++;
    case 4: *to = *from++;
    case 3: *to = *from++;
    case 2: *to = *from++;
    case 1: *to = *from++;
    }
</code></pre>
Now take a look at the actual Duff's device implementation line by line:<p><pre><code>  register n=(count+7)/8;
</code></pre>
<i>n</i> is the number of iterations of the copy-8-words unrolled loop.
The +7 causes the division by 8 to round up in order to count the extra partial loop iteration required when <i>count</i> is not a multiple of 8.<p><pre><code>  switch(count%8){
</code></pre>
<i>count % 8</i> is the number of left-over words that need to be handled with a partial copy loop (rather than full 8-byte copy loops). The switch will jump to one of the following case labels in order to skip to a part of the unrolled copy loop such that exactly the number of left-over bytes will be copied.<p><pre><code>  case 0:	do{	*to = *from++;
</code></pre>
This is the first case of the switch, but also the beginning of the unrolled copy loop.  If <i>count</i> happened to be a multiple of 8, then <i>count % 8</i> would be 0, and the unrolled copy loop would begin executing as normal, identical to the simplified code above that only handles multiples of 8.  Note that C's switch statement cases are essentially just labels; execution will fall through to the next case label unless a <i>break</i> is encountered, so after first entering the <i>do{}while</i> loop, the <i>case</i> statements are essentially ignored.<p><pre><code>  case 7:		*to = *from++;
</code></pre>
This line is where the real magic begins.  If <i>count % 8</i> was not 0, part of the first iteration of the unrolled loop will be skipped <i>by jumping into the middle of the loop</i> using the <i>case</i> label matching the number of extra words required.  Then further iterations of the loop will continue as normal, copying the full 8 words per iteration.<p>The following case statements all serve the same purpose: to set up a label for a partial copy loop of the given number of words during the first iteration.<p><pre><code>  }while(--n>0);
</code></pre>
This is the end of the unrolled copy loop. <i>n</i>, as calculated above, is the number of times to run the unrolled loop; remember that it included an extra iteration (due to rounding up) to account for the partial first iteration if <i>count % 8</i> was not 0.  When execution reaches this <i>while</i>, it will jump back up to the <i>do</i> (which happens to be in the middle of a <i>switch</i>, but that doesn't matter anymore - the <i>case</i> labels are ignored and the unrolled loop will now execute as normal, copying the full 8 words each iteration.<p>The magic is in reusing the same unrolled copy loop code to also do the initial partial copy.",1344531708

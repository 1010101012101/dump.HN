Having been a leader on a good amount of projects that involved programming, I have completely lost count of the number of times someone didn't do their job and coded something completely different because they thought they were superman and could save the world by coding something else or coding it differently than what we thought.

320083,comment,319889,319889,0,0,geuis,,,"This is just IMHO: The whole ""rant on Apple's app store policies"" meme has run out of mileage. Its kinda getting like Rickrolls, except not as funny. I know several developers that have successfully gotten apps into the store. One of them is doing <i>VERY</i> well. His opinion when I asked him about this was basically, ""Apple states it all pretty clearly in the documentation when you sign up. Some types of apps (podcaster for example) are obviously going to run up against functionality Apple already has implemented, if in a different form. You just don't develop for those areas.""\nIt seems like mostly the only people who have been yelling, complaining, bellyaching, and blogging about Apple's policies are the ones that can't read the frakking docs. The developers who are all doing quite well don't have a big problem with the restrictions.<p>Bottom line, the iPhone SDK wasn't developed by an organization like W3C. It was built by a company that wants to make a profit. They own the incredibly popular platform. If you want to play, you play by their rules.<p>Otherwise, you can write apps for Android. You can sell your apps to the 1/10 of a percent of people that will buy the clunky HTC Dream and similar devices that do or will run the Android platform. I'd love to see Android running on the iPhone. That would give the great hardware plus the open OS. I would stick with the iPhone OS, but the option should be out there.",1222810685

320073,comment,320068,320068,0,0,portfolioexec,,,"Here's the rub: a divergence of incentives...<p>""The typical investment manager/financial innovator thinks: 'If I win, my profit will be proportional to the gross sales I have initiated. If I lose, I will be dismissed, and perhaps I will lose my reputation in the process.' Thinking even further, the manager realises that the downside is limited to being fired, but the upside is limitless. This asymmetry between profits and losses encourages audacity. Once a certain risk threshold is breached, the investment manager who places bets with other peopleâ€™s money ignores danger. From a social point of view, the problem stems from the divergence of incentives. Even though the intermediary knows that he may suffer a severe personal loss, it will never be proportional to the losses inflicted on investors.""",1222809694

There are three posts in favor of Flash on the iPhone here and as of this posting, they have all been downmodded to -1. Assuming they are legit opinions, I don't understand the Flash hate.<p>In the face of standards, fine. But knowing that the consumer doesn't care about standards, the ability for a Flash application to appear consistent across platforms, which is plain drudgery in HTML now (and given IE6's prevalence, will last for a good while, like it or not), I can see downsides, but it doesn't look overwhelmingly bad.<p>Or, would you explain the principle argument against it, aside of the standards bit?",1222809440

It's very much at odds with the ""common wisdom"" portrayed by the media.<p>As for how it could happen - my cubemate bought a house in the South End of Boston in 2006, right next to downtown.  He's a well-established professional, solid skills, solid resume, and I believe makes over 6 figures.  But he bought the house with a $500k interest only mortgage.  His banker told him that nearly everything they wrote these days is interest-only, and he should buy the biggest home he could afford.  So if housing prices fall, he has every incentive to walk away.  It hasn't happened yet (he got promoted to CTO, and prices are still rising in the South End), but I could imagine there're many people who took out similar terms but don't have the same wherewithal to pay them.",1222809057

320050,comment,319582,319582,0,0,jamiequint,,,"I disagree.<p>Take a midsize bank market cap of $5B and multiply it by 25-50 for the number of banks that might fail. That is a total loss of around $125B-$250B for which shareholders and employees of these companies bear the losses. Also should these banks fail, the government will have to step in via FDIC. The problem with this is that assuming an average balance of $10000 per depositor $700B covers 70 Million accounts. While this is probably sufficient for average individual depositors, what is to happen to the small businesses that have greater than $100k in assets? Also, what happens to the availability of credit with so many banks in default?<p>Bankruptcy actually seems more risky, as the people who would lose are small businesses and those with over $100k in the bank, people who would <i>never</i> have recourse to get their money back. Rather than socialized losses (through inflation), its losses for an unlucky few. The bailout plan, however, which involves taking warrants in the companies we are giving money to seems to have a good chance of repaying at least a significant portion of what it costs overall.<p>Thoughts?",1222808709

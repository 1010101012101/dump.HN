2624201,comment,2624086,2624111,34,0,petewailes,,,"This.<p>When you get right down to it, all marketing is finding an audience that someone else has, and borrowing it. If I'm buying AdWords ads, it's Google's audience, if I'm getting press in the NYT, it's theirs, if I'm putting up billboards in the middle of London, it's the M4's traffic into the city.<p>The key is threefold: 1. audience interest & profile compatibility, 2. clear conversion points, and 3. a UVP.<p>Breaking those down:<p>1. What you're pushing out, and the interests of the audience, have to be aligned. So if you're launching a new HN-style area, you need to know who your audience are (probably dissatisfied HN-ers, some people from Reddit, programmers etc), and identify where those people are (HN, GitHub, Engadget, Bit-tech, Twitter...) and how you can reach them (ad platforms, publicity on blogs that they read, referrals, recommendations from trusted sources).<p>Understanding your users is key, both in being able to find them, and being able to serve them when they reach you.<p>2. Know what your points of conversion are. Is it getting someone on to the site? Is it having them sign up for something? Registering an account? Downloading something? Leaving comments? Starting threads? All these things are valid conversions, but it's important to know which ones you want to look at, and which ones are just going to be distractions.<p>Also, what are you going to do with this data? How about setting up a notifier for your first 250 users, when you reach that point, so you can email them all in person and thank them for coming along? Think about what you want to do with the data you collect, before you collect it. Data without purpose is just time invested for no gain.<p>3. What's your UVP (Unique Value Proposition)? Why should people come to you instead of wherever else is available? Audience quality? Signal to Noise ratio? Curation of content? Design? Features? What's the benefit that you offer over someone else?<p>If you can't convey this clearly, you're going to have problems. It's rare to get something like Twitter's early days where downtime and a confusing message is overcome by audience enthusiasm and the community doing your messaging for you. Ensure that you know what you want to tell people, and how you're going to do it.<p>Hope this helps.",1307353788

Or at least, I think of them as alternatives, and they're often presented that way.<p>The classic error-signaling approach is in-band signaling through 'error' return values, but that has the problem of any in-band-signaling solution, clash between the control and data values. Two possible solutions are: 1) in-band signaling with a more complex (data,control) encoding scheme, in this case every function returning (value,error-code); or 2) out-of-band signaling. The simplest example of #2 is C's <i>errno</i> facility, with one global out-of-band error status system; exceptions can be taken as a more sophisticated improvement that implements local context, along with infrastructure to make it easy to specify error-handling policies.<p>But it's interesting to think of exceptions as syntactic sugar on an in-band-signaling solution, rather than out-of-band signaling at all (at least conceptually), with Monads wrapping the code to check/propagate the error signal.",1307353122

Currently the bar is far below that, with many teachers obviously phoning it in to anyone paying attention. They can't be fired, and that's the problem I was talking about. I went to an excellent public school, and I was tiered with the 'smart kids', so I generally had relatively good teachers, and some that were absolutely excellent. Even there, though, some were blatantly awful, and should have clearly been fired. I took a couple of non-""Gifted and Talented"" classes, and the teachers there were a good bit worse on average. Some seemingly knew less about their subject than some of their students, and taught things that were just false in some cases.<p>It's demoralizing to have terrible teachers.

It's cliched, but the kids in schools do form the base of the country's economy a few years down the road, and if a high percentage of them can't do much more than manual labor or service work because they weren't inspired and decided that learning sucked, the US is screwed in the long term.

Ruby and Python were getting popular long before Rails and Django came on the scene so before you go running your mouth about core people ignoring the needs of people you should think long and hard about subverting the needs of an entire community just so you can develop another web app.",1307351763

What are you doing that other student publications aren't?<p>When you say ""If you have a game-changing idea"" do you honestly thing NSU is ""game-changing""? What game are you changing?<p>You come across as incredibly entitled and arrogant in your post, I hope for the sake of the success of any future ""start ups"" you participate in, it's not the case.<p>""I have no deference to authority figures and have never been shy to voice my opinions, oftentimes to my detriment.""

There are obscure forums that I sometimes read on the portal bsh.co.il - this is an Israeli social work portal. Click on a message in a forum like <a href=""http://www.bsh.co.il/forums/AllMessages2.asp?Fnumber=10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bsh.co.il/forums/AllMessages2.asp?Fnumber=10</a> - there is going to be a checkmark next to the message you clicked from now on, even if you reload the browser (presumably, there is a cookie). This is a small custom-written forum with very little programmer muscle behind it, I doubt it's more than a couple of guys. If they can do it, everyone can do it - and it's a small step to hiding threads completely, etc., etc.<p>I've concluded that there is just no demand for sophisticated threading/reading software of the type we had in the '90s. If there was demand, there is certainly technology to fill it. If they can run Linux in a browser complete with a little C compiler, they can run the equivalent of trn. As you pointed out yourself, Gmail covers the basics already - why not make it more sophisticated and bring the technology to Google Groups? No demand. Otherwise, one of the sources of innovation in this industry - big corps, startups, or academic/open source, would have filled it. Even if it required extending HTTP/HTML somehow - these extensions happen quickly when really needed.",1307351318

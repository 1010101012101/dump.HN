The Haskell notation is a simple, concise representation of the actual semantics. If you try to transpose those semantics to a more conventional notation intended for different semantics, it gets complicated due to the mismatch.<p>This notation I’ve suggested doesn’t even accurately express such details as currying and typeclasses, which the original notation conveys neatly.",1442105920

And the amount you pay to transact stock at one of these places is the best deal you could find to transact virtually anything.

5709669,story,,,1,2,quavtum,"Bitcoin mining to earn money from free web content or mobile apps",,"Recently there have been discussions about how to pay content generators money for reading their content.  E.g. How do I pay a good journalist who writes a great news blog for his or her work?  Has anyone thought embedding Bitcoin mining JavaScript code that runs in the Browser while the reader is reading the content? Similar idea (native code instead of JavaScript) could be used to support free apps on mobile phones and tablets.  This idea has several nice properties:
1. The content creator gets paid directly by mining Bitcoin. 
2. The payoff is proportional to the amount of time the content or application is used by the user.
3. No need for ads to support content or free apps.<p>Unfortunately, the idea also has a couple of disadvantages that I can think of:
1.  I have read that it gets progressively harder to mine Bitcoin.  Depending on the exchange rate of Bitcoin to physical goods, this could be a problem.  My guess is this is a flaw due to the design decisions of Bitcoin.  Another virtual currency designed so that mining it does not get progressively less fruitful, would solve this problem.
2.  The User could hook the javascript/Browser and possibly steal the mined Bitcoins.  This could be mitigated by making it hard enough that the payoff would be too small.  Also, for the mobile apps, the hooking and stealing should be a lot harder.<p>The whole idea seems obvious, so I wonder if anyone has already tried or done this?",1368582610

Universities, and boards of regents, are deeply conservative, risk-averse institutions in some ways.  There's also a lot of cost to startup a program like this, and public universities aren't exactly rolling in money right now.<p>Beyond that, a lot of companies have some kind of tuition assistance for graduate degrees, and a lot of companies are having trouble finding skilled talent to begin with.  So it's a way to save money and improve recruiting.<p>The business models of companies like Udacity and Coursera are probably going to rely heavily on the hunger of companies the size of AT&T, Google, etc. for a steady supply of trained workers. Somebody's got to pay the bills and make the VCs rich.<p>I like to think of this as shifting part of the cost of the education from the individual to the company that's ultimately benefitting from it.

5709563,comment,5704892,5704892,4,0,NamTaf,,,"A lot of people seem to be struggling to understand why this solution is needed in place of {big metal bar, hanging chains, flashing signs above road, etc.} and why drivers seem to act counter to logic and common sense by ignoring warnings and so ending up in situations where they're stuck and cause damage to their truck or load.<p>It's as simple as this: signs around the edge of your field of vision are far less noticeable than signs directly in the centre of your field of vision. Signs around the edge are also far more common than signs directly in the middle of the road. Common events (such as these signs whizzing past) breed complacency and it's a fundamental tenant of workplace health and safety that some of the biggest risk events are not those that are inherently risky or difficult, but those that are performed so frequently that the practitioners become lazy with complacency (example: smacking yourself in the face and knocking your teeth out when undoing a tight bolt because you're pulling the spanner towards you). Driving is such a repetitive task that said complacency is incredibly high as a result, which explains all kinds of road phenomenon that you'll witness on a daily basis and wonder 'what the HELL was that idiot thinking?!?'.<p>In the rail industry, level crossing incidents are way too common. I recall one several years ago that killed the two train drivers when a B-double ran a crossing and ripped the oncoming train right off the tracks when the train ran in to the trailer of the B-double. The report ([1] specifically sections 2.3.7 and 2.3.8 starting PDF page 72. Fascinating reading about human factors of accidents if you're in to that) made it very clear that the truck driver failed to see the flashing lights and associated signage alerting that a train was coming. As a result, he failed to stop. Importantly, it notes that it is entirely possible to miss major changes to your environment (big flashing signs, in the tunnel case) if your attention is elsewhere.<p>Couple that with the fact that driving long distances for extended periods can be almost hypnotic, especially at night and when fatigued. Driving becomes almost automatic. Ever driven a long distance and realised you don't actually remember specifics of the journey? Yeh. These guys are going to be driving at night (due to being in the middle of a major city) where lights from billboards, etc. are surrounding their field of view. It's like driving through a star trek warp speed tunnel with lights flashing past your field of view constantly. That's hypnotic and you zone out as a result. As such, the driver's attention levels are pretty much nil and no low-hanging beam is going to snap him back to reality.<p>By throwing something completely different directly in the field of vision, the driver is immediately snapped back to reality in a big way. Your attention is (usually) mostly focused on the road in front of you when you're driving, even when you're distracted. Furthering the extremity of the reality check is that it's a gigantic 'STOP' sign - not just the word stop, but the word stop in the big red hexagonal sign. The sign is designed to provoke a response by its shape and colour (we're conditioned to hold that meaning to said shape and colour) and throwing it immediately in front of the driver will grab their attention in a way that bars and chains and all that simply will not.<p>In summary, by using a sign directly in front of the driver rather than through some secondary communications medium (e.g.: banging on the roof of the vehicle), the likelihood of detection and subsequent reaction is far higher. It will succeed where other mechanisms of alerting will fail. Water is used because it's convenient, doesn't cause lasting damage/debris and can be deployed very quickly. For the benefit such a design brings (avoiding blocking just about the biggest express road thoroughfare in Australia's largest city), the upfront cost is negligible and is easily justified over cheaper but less effective alternatives.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/~/media/Safety/railsafety/safetyreports/Pdf_rail_safety_investigation_qt2459_complete.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/~/media/Safety/railsafety/safetyre...</a>",1368580734

I've done a ton of studies in microbiology, you don't even need a 101 in biology to see how random and unpredictable life can be. Genetics will not guarantee you are getting the same dog back.

There's also something called epigenetics (changes in genes throughout your life), it's another reason why twin develop differences after birth.<p>Losing a pet can be tragic, but don't let grief push you in the wrong direction.

Were not yet ready to announce a specific program cost, but the plan is to offer the Georgia Tech OMS CS for a total cost of under $7,000a fraction of the cost of Georgia Techs on-campus program and even less than that of comparable private universities.<p>> The total workload is the same as the residential program; the weekly or hourly workload depends on how quickly students wish to complete the program.<p>This is <i>revolutionary</i>.<p>Not only is it much cheaper, the incentives are now back in alignment. I know plenty of people that could graduate much faster and get on with their lives - The schools on the other hand, want them to stay longer (and thus pay more).<p>This removes the nickel and dime element and all kinds of backwards tedium.",1368579749

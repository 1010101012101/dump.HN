This made coordination of inviting guests over difficult for me and my girlfriend, as we had to choose whose number to use -- an idea born.<p>This is my first venture into entrepreneurship, so I'd really like to hear any feedback.  For those curious, I'm using Play 2.0.x on Heroku.  Twilio's the phone provider and Stripe's the payment provider.  I started this project to learn some new things and break out of my J2EE dayjob doldrums.<p>Since buzzeromatic folded, there doesn't seem to be anything else in this space - although the real challenge now is how to get it to the consumers who'd find it useful.

A core of customers do, of course (and I am one of them), but the vast majority are happy with their Samsung Galaxies and their HTC Ones. They don't care about 'stock'.

But I prefer to give HN the benefit of the doubt.<p>Umm I try and be gentle.  But let's talk about the fundamental problem, since you appear to understand it.<p>TCP-RST DoS is like the worst denial of service ever, since it has such massive negative amplification. You're spending like something like 30k * (required window guess packets) to interrupt one connection, which requires like say less than 10 packets to re-establish. Unless you're talking about BGP, which shit, we normally use TCP-MD5 for anyway. Even commodity home bullshit throws most of your packets away for free.<p>I take things quite slowly. The normal HN methodology is to go ""Incorrect. blah blah blah."". Reality is nuanced and complicated. I try and avoid doing that, because honestly most statements are actually right when you squint at them the right way. Unfortunately, I get the most fake internet points when I say stupid and ultimately unsupportable bullshit while drunk. I still try to avoid doing that :/  But ahhhh here I go anyway.<p>The nuanced version of this is that most people's devices are going to get DoS'd way harder by fake ipsec traffic which forces checksums in CPU than it is by out of sequence packets which get handled in hardware.<p>But why don't we live in this fantasy world where we can all terminate TCP connections with imaginary sniper packets and ipsec solves everything.",1361462066

So yes, there almost certainly are people at Sony who could do what you described.<p>I'm torn on this whole issue. On the one hand, I think the world would be a much better place if we didn't have silly draconian copyright laws, so I don't like to see those silly laws given any further legitimacy by using them (and I write that as a guy who makes his living creating stuff that is protected by copyright). On the other hand, those laws <i>are</i> laws because of companies like Sony, and hoping they won't be used doesn't stop them being laws.<p>I suspect if companies like Sony started paying obscenely disproportionate fines for careless minor infringements, this might be the fastest way to get the problem fixed, though regrettably with significant collateral damage resulting along the way. For example, if they have sponsored laws that call for criminal sanctions against individuals who infringe copyright for commercial gain, those laws should be hovering over any conceivably responsible individuals at Sony and anywhere they outsourced to as well in cases like this. If merely working for a company like Sony on any creative project is potentially enough to get you a criminal record, the true damage caused by draconian copyright laws will become apparent to them very quickly (and probably quite briefly, since it seems unlikely that a company that became so toxic to employees and agencies would last very long).<p>I really dislike that I've come to that conclusion, but looking at the world as it is rather than as I wish it to be, I have trouble seeing any more logical outcome.",1361460890

For example at my work Racket is the most popular Lisp: I use it and no one else ever used or is going to use any other Lisp... :)<p>Racket is a very young language. Until a few (3?) years ago it was a (PLT) Scheme; Scheme has it's uses but they are very specific, nobody would use a Scheme as a general purpose, systems programming language. Racket evolved and is now much more than simply a Scheme-with-extensions: it's a platform for language creation as well as robust runtime and has many very good tools.<p>It all makes sense if you look at Racket as a fresh language, that only started a few years ago - think about Python in it's infancy. It is very impressive and surprisingly mature in comparison, but it's still very young and has many parts missing - it's <i>almost</i> ready for production, but not quite there yet and I don't think this should be rushed.<p>Sticking with Racket now is a kind of gamble. I think that in a six to eight years time Racket will be competing with Clojure for a place of the most popular Lisp in existence and I think that in the future it will be the ""new hot thing"" for a while, just as Python or Ruby or JavaScript were. Most importantly Racket is a language that I'd really like to use in ten years. But still, it's uncertain and any number of things can go wrong and Racket can remain unpopular, niche product for eternity. That's the risk of using young, aspiring languages - I once won betting on Python and now I'm going to try again with Racket.<p>So, to summarize this rant: Racket is very young; languages need time to gain traction; if Racket evolves as fast as it does it will become insanely popular when the time comes.",1361460679

5257894,comment,5256888,5256888,13,0,mtgx,,,"I think Google messed up badly early on by not putting marketing muscle behind the Android brand, which was also a side effect of how they treated Android itself.<p>They let Android be turned into whatever others wanted it to be, and maybe they promoted the Android brand, maybe they didn't. And if they did, they tried to ""own"" it. But mostly they've tried to mention it as little as possible, while promoting their own stuff.<p>Google <i>should've never let this happen</i>. They should've treated it the same way they treat the Chromebooks. Nothing gets changed in ChromeOS unless Google says so. And everything works the same across Chromebooks. All upgrades come from Google for all Chromebooks, and every 6 weeks. It's tight and it's clean. And they get to promote the brand.<p>But Android is the opposite of that. Google has no control over 99% of the Android devices when it comes to upgrades. This is terrible for users, terrible for developers, and terrible for the security of these devices, whenever there's some big security exploit. Okay, Google can still uninstall apps from your phone in case something like that happens, but they can't really fix the issue usually.<p>Android should've been run like Chrome and ChromeOS from the very beginning. They should've had the ""main brand"" (like Chrome), and then they should've had the ""open source brand"" (like Chromium). Google only ever promotes the Chrome brand, and now that's what OEM's and customers want. They want Chrome. They don't want Chromium.<p>They missed that opportunity with Android. Android should've been the main bran that Google owns, gets to modify, and updates. If they would've done that from the beginning, then OEM's and customers would've also wanted the unaltered Google-owned Android, rather than the ""heavily-customized open source brand"" that Android has turned into, and is the main choice for virtually every OEM. So the Android world is like a bizarro world where ""Chromium"" would be what most OEM's and customer want, not Google's own Chrome.<p>But there is still time to fix that - by expanding the ""Chromebook-tight"" Nexus program. Get Nexus become to Android what Chrome is to Chromium. And then try to make 99% of OEM's and customers to prefer the Nexus over the heavily-customized open source ""Android"". This will probably take 5 years or longer now, but I think it can be done. Even if half of the market is ""Nexus devices"" 5 years from now, I think it will be worth it.<p>Of course it would've been much easier to do this from day one, since now they have to fight and uphill battle, and ""unconvince"" OEM's that they want to use the ""Nexus OS""/stock Android, not their own customized stuff. But slowly, they can convince customers to buy those, and in time the OEM's as well, if that's what the people want.<p>So if they are indeed applying this strategy, then that's good. I've noticed they are promoting the Nexus devices lately. Now they just need to get more OEM's on board (not just one at a time). That would give people more choices through out the year for Nexus devices. Some may like the Nexus, but if they want to buy a new phone 4 months later, they might just get the latest Samsung or HTC device, because they'd still prefer a newer phone.<p>This also needs to happen for low-end devices. I want to be able to buy my mom a very cheap Nexus phone. I'm thinking $100-$200 range here. It can be done with Cortex A7, a decent 720p capable GPU, and a 800x480 resolution display. It should be good enough performance wise, but Google should still make sure these devices aren't very buggy or something. And they should handle the updates for them.<p>A good way to start pushing more ""Nexus"" devices in the market is by getting Motorola to use only stock Android. I think they'd be really stupid if they aren't doing this. Their customers <i>want</i> them to do it. <i>Screw</i> the other OEM's if they get upset about it. They're free to join the Nexus program (and they should be), and use stock Android, too. They'll come around if Motorola shows there's a market for that. So Google needs to stop fooling around, and start being serious taking back control of Android with the Nexus OS/program.",1361460347

The expressions would be gigantic, unmaintainable messes, and probably not even possible to write by hand, but nonetheless it's more of a practical problem than an issue of formal language power.<p>For example, WebKit sets a maximum DOM nesting limit of 512 [1], and most other browsers have a limit as well. A context-free language restricted to a finite maximum production depth becomes a regular language, so WebKit's parsing <i>could</i> be done by an NFA or DFA, and the parser could be encoded as a regular expression if desired. But the only plausible way to write such an expression correctly would be to mechanically ""compile"" it from a grammar.

Why commiserate in places where OP is actually repeatedly at fault and chose the wrong way? How can you properly commiserate at times when OP was right if you can't see where they are?

Providing basic care as early as possible to people is the best way to catch problems earlier and reduce overall cost of treatment. Anything that gets in the way of a person seeking basic care, such as payment or wrangling with insurance, means that some people will choose not to seek or will delay seeking basic care. Universal health care options that do not require individuals to pay at time of service are far better for removing barriers to accessing basic care.",1361459069

One piece of advice I can give from experience:<p>After you've left your first startup behind you, <i>take a break.</i><p>Mine was only a month, but it was the most productive, thoughtful, and interesting month ever. I came up with new ideas about business, people, philosophy, and the world, and just had some of the best and most clear thinking I had had in many years. I processed my former mistakes and turned them into valuable lessons that I will remember forever. I had tons of new ideas and started writing them down. I went skiing a lot. That month has proved immeasurably valuable.<p>It's amazing what your brain can do when it has space, and you need to let it have that space, especially after such a long time being focused on one thing.<p>My explicit recommendation to the OP: leave it all behind for as long as you are able (a week, 2 weeks, a month), travel, and bring a journal.<p>And rememberyou'll have a new perspective on all of this in a year's time. Try to keep that 1 year/5 year/10 year outlook and just take the next step. Don't worry, it's just life.",1361459022

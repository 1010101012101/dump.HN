It is one of the unique strengths of Silicon Valley (and the tech industry at large). People both overestimate and underestimate the value of an advanced technical degree in Silicon Valley.<p>On the overestimation side, you can work at the most extremely technical end of the spectrum without a relevant degree <i>if you are good enough</i>. You can be named an IBM Fellow without completing high school or do some of the most advanced theoretical computer science research without a degree. I know of several examples. The idea that a degree is <i>required</i> for this is nonsense even if it certainly makes it easier. Additionally many slightly more mundane jobs require a high degree of intelligence but the skill can be learned by a sufficiently motivated individual.<p>At the same time, most people are not that good. And in those cases, a degree helps considerably. People have a tendency to overestimate their own abilities so they do not really know if they are good enough to get on without a degree until many years after they enter the workforce, at which point that knowledge is moot.",1370843687

What happens next?  What&#x27;s the solution?  We could just accept that privacy is a thing of the past.  Or could a better standard make the server not even be capable of handing over your data if it wanted to?  On the surface, the idea seems patently absurd.  And maybe it is.<p>I&#x27;m no encryption expert.  I&#x27;m sure there are AT LEAST a few dozen people here whose knowledge on this subject dwarfs mine.  So, let&#x27;s get those mental juices flowing.  Maybe something already exists but isn&#x27;t being used.  If not, I&#x27;m hoping the mere suggestion of the idea sparks an idea that leads to greatness.<p>After thinking about what such an implementation might look like, the best I&#x27;ve come up with is a key that changes each time to be used for the next message.  You send an message to a server.  It&#x27;s encrypted with a key that your client generated the last time it sent a message.  The server can use that key (which it received with the previous message and stored) to decrypt that message.  Included with your new message is a new key that will be used next time.  This allows the server to store a bunch of messages for you, but it&#x27;s only capable of decrypting one of them.  To be able to view history, the keys would all be stored on your own computer.<p>Unfortunately, this brings us a step backwards in terms of usability.  Suddenly you&#x27;re back to the days of only having one client capable of reading your stuff.  The other thought that crossed my mind was client-to-client communication.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to accomplish the same end goal - give companies an excuse to tell the FBI/NSA &quot;Sorry, but I couldn&#x27;t give you that information, no matter how badly I want to&quot;.<p>What do you all think?

But even then, we are not requiring real identity and we are implementing SSL everywhere and are happy if users use VPNs or Tor to connect.<p>Why all the fuss? I believe that through a persons&#x27; interests one can determine political affiliation. So I believe that to allow people to organise themselves freely around their hobbies and pastimes, that we must consider this and protect them from any entities that might use that information against the individuals. Further I believe that when people of shared interest come together that they are likely to organise to protect and preserve that interest, and this means that interest groups galvanise ad-hoc lobby groups and activists.<p>I also hope it changes, but I&#x27;m going to act as if I believe it will get worse on all fronts.",1370840871

I can answer it, hopefully with good points of my own, since I&#x27;m the guy who created the Flood Washington with 1984 campaign earlier this evening.<p>Several reasons:<p>- Elected officials have a direct vote. &quot;These programs are subject to congressional oversight and congressional re-authorization and congressional debate.&quot;  President Obama on June 7. \n- If the campaign is successful, journalists will hear about it in a way that makes it more interesting to report on. If I&#x27;m a journalist, I want to write about a grass-roots campaign to change Washington--not a campaign to--what, change journalism?\n- I&#x27;m upset with elected officials such as my own Dianne Feinstein who are publicly defending the program. I have no beef with journalists.\n- It didn&#x27;t even occur to me to send the book to journalists.<p>P.S.

It all depends on the agency and the role. Some are &quot;Public Trust&quot; which is the barely-above civilian clearance which takes less than a month. On the other end of the spectrum are your top-secret clearances which take months to years to complete.

Patents are only granted if there's no prior art and as such if apple uses anything (such as slide to unlock) in one of their devices without patenting it that also removes the possibility for anyone else to patent it.<p>>If Samsung or Google would lead the mobile Race...<p>There are already more android devices than iOS devices. Google also leads in various other internet spaces and isn't nearly as aggressive patent-wise as Apple.<p>You're right that patent reform is the real solution, but I don't think it's us who ""dont [sic] get the reality of the whole patent thing"" but you.",1341489437

Building my own website as well as working as the senior engineer during my day job forces me to be involved in all facets of web developing. The jobs are not abstracted. You are expected to know what you're doing from the front end to the back end. If not, nothing get done in a timely manner.

I could <i>not</i> reproduce it in a dev environment.  Worse, we didn't even notice it for a long time because it was a nightly job, and people were not reporting an absence of their notifications.  (nightly job to email reports).<p>Finally got a dump of live data to dev system (it's a lot of data, so I don't pull it all the time).  Someone had updated their email address to something invalid, and the system threw an uncaught exception in the middle of the loop (yay java).  So... half the people were getting their stuff, the second half didn't - guilty record was a user with last name starting with L.<p>Yes, we should have prevented a bad email from going in with validation, but it slipped my testing (and the client's).  It's just shocking to me today that professional people whose job it is to send and receive email can mistype their email.  ""john smith @yaho"" is not valid, yes I should catch that, but someone <i>typed that in</i>.  Adding on top of that was my own dynamic language background not mapping well to the JVM - one bad address in the middle of a loop doesn't just get skipped and logged, but the entire process now stops.<p>Multiple lessons learned from that one certainly (logging, validation, exception handling, etc) but... it would have been a lot longer for me to even consider putting in an invalid email address (it worked in dev - it was working for end users, etc) - pulling live data was the only thing that made it apparent.",1341488531

At present this is something which no existing stereoscopic HMD (or indeed, Google Glass) handles to my knowledge.<p>It's also worth noting that existing stereoscopic HMDs, while impressive, have been known to cause discomfort such as headaches in some people when worn for more than a few hours.<p>So there doesn't appear to be any link to Project Glass which, it should be noted, has also been patented by Google.

Can you let him on?  I don't know how to use this thing.""<p>* Grandma calls her son the Dad who's away on a business trip: ""I know you've blocked Facebook from your daughter's machine, but it's also blocked on my laptop.  Can you unblock it for me?  I'm trying to make plans!""<p>Sure, one could try to walk someone through the steps over the phone, or even remote desktop into a box to make the changes... or just tell them ""wait til I get home, too bad!"".  But theoretically, both of these scenarios could be fixed with a cloud oriented mgt system.<p>Look, Cisco made a total clusterF out of how they handled this, but it's also easy to see what they were trying to solve for.  They just hamhanded it, in a huge way.  Also, these scenarios are potentially rare, so they made people change everything about the router just to solve these edge cases, agreed.<p>But I suspect many more products will have cloud/external management before long, whether they should or not.

We have rarely managed to hold a meeting without one of our small team struggling to see either a word processor document or a spreadsheet properly, and that's just the minor cosmetic or browser incompatibility bugs that keep appearing along with all those minor UI changes. We have also experienced some much more serious problems, including corruption/data loss and seeing the entire change history for some files become inaccessible for no apparent reason. In other words, it's not just minor UI errors that crept in as the product evolved, there are evidently fundamental flaws in the underlying architecture that don't store the data robustly.<p>Another example: I spent a couple of days last week trying to figure out why a site that had been working fine for users until recently and had not been changed at all on our side was suddenly generating bug reports. It turned out that recent Chrome builds have broken some HTML5 features in multiple ways. There have been related bug reports in some cases, but they have been closed as the specific example given no longer seemed to be a problem. Again, the nature of the problems makes it obvious that these are not just one-liner issues but fundamental flaws, typically where Chrome is so aggressive with its cache usage and/or trigging redrawing/relayout that it just plain doesn't work. And even though the bugs had been reported, obviously the correct root cause was never identified and fixed.<p>Another example: I recently spent some time looking into how the Closure Tools are coming along. Have you tried the examples/demonstrations for the Closure Library recently? Many of them simply don't work in Gecko-based browsers, and that would be obvious if anyone working on the project had made even a cursory attempt to test them for five minutes.<p>I will finish by once again acknowledging that my experiences here may be atypical, and that the particular projects I've mentioned that I happen to be using may not reflect the wider Google culture. But on the evidence before me, I see an organisation that keeps breaking things in its rush to push new features out and that demonstrably lacks robust architectures that keep data safe, effective testing processes before pushing code into production, and proper issue resolution processes when defects do get reported.",1341486848

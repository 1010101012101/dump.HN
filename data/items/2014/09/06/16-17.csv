Having that &quot;CEO&quot; and prior experience managing complicated projects on my resume absolutely puts me in a different class in looking for new jobs if it comes to that. I would have been hard pressed to come by that kind of experience at Intel or another big company, even though at one of those places I would have gotten tons of great experience in doing tech development.",1410022714

In DRAM you have a charge hidden in a well behind a single transistor and it&#x27;s designed to be stable for a while (the refresh interval) without anybody doing anything to it.  SRAM doesn&#x27;t have that static component at all, it&#x27;s a set of 6 or 8 transistors which have two stable configurations when powered and which lose their state as fast as all the other logic in your chip as soon as the power is cut.<p>You can play with the temperature if you want, but the mechanisms that prevent unauthorized access in normal conditions will have their lifetimes extended or decreased as much as you change the lifetime of the data you&#x27;re trying to access.  And liquid nitrogen temperatures at least tend to make everything happen faster in CMOS circuitry.  That&#x27;s governed by a complex interaction between the effect of temperature on carrier density and carrier mobility, so I&#x27;m not sure that you couldn&#x27;t slow things down with, say, liquid helium, but even then I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re buying anything.",1410022132

Top worldwide reseller for several products. But the companies we resold for were so keen to cash out that they stabbed the resellers in the back to improve the numbers right before the sale.

They are a sort of enlarged monopolies, and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of employments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the natural price, and maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits of the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate.</i><p>On bargaining power between labour and capital (&quot;masters&quot;):<p><i>The masters, being fewer in number [than labour], can combine much more easily: and the law, besides, authorises, or at least does not prohibit, their combinations, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work, but many against combining to raise it.</i><p>...<p><i>We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate. To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours and equals. We seldom, indeed, hear of this combination, because it is the usual, and, one may say, the natural state of things, which nobody ever hears of. Masters, too, sometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of labour even below this rate. These are always conducted with the utmost silence and secrecy till the moment of execution; and when the workmen yield, as they sometimes do without resistance, though severely felt by them, they are never heard of by other people. Such combinations, however, are frequently resisted by a contrary defensive combination of the workmen, who sometimes, too, without any provocation of this kind, combine, of their own accord, to raise the price of their labour. Their usual pretences are, sometimes the high price of provisions, sometimes the great profit which their masters make by their work. But whether their combinations be offensive or defensive, they are always abundantly heard of. In order to bring the point to a speedy decision, they have always recourse to the loudest clamour, and sometimes to the most shocking violence and outrage. They are desperate, and act with the folly and extravagance of desperate men, who must either starve, or frighten their masters into an immediate compliance with their demands. The masters, upon these occasions, are just as clamorous upon the other side, and never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combination of servants, labourers, and journeymen. The workmen, accordingly, very seldom derive any advantage from the violence of those tumultuous combinations, which, partly from the interposition of the civil magistrate, partly from the superior steadiness of the masters, partly from the necessity which the greater part of the workmen are under of submitting for the sake of present subsistence, generally end in nothing but the punishment or ruin of the ringleaders.</i><p>There are many more examples in <i>Wealth of Nations</i>: <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm</a><p>As for modern economics and markets, there&#x27;s Coase (eponymous theorem on market extermalties), Olson (&quot;Logic of Collective Action&quot;), and Akerlof (&quot;The Market for Lemons&quot;) and a whole slew of other market failures:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure</a>",1410020938

There&#x27;s no getting a free pass for playing sports. The year I graduated high school, my school ranked as one of the top 5 in the UK public school system (it was also the only one that the examiners made no mention of ways to improve, meaning it was likely the top school in the country) and I didn&#x27;t even know we had a football (soccer) team that competed against other schools.

I was an over-performer. I got one of the highest grades in class and did nothing, didn&#x27;t hand in homework because anything that was to the standardized test I aced. One of my elementary school teachers thought I was slow and wanted me to get tested for dyslexia or other learning disorders and said I would fail the Key Stage 1 tests. I was 3rd in my class. The bar was so low that me and my &quot;nerdy&quot; friends in high school barely worked in classes. My chemistry class we would be finished our work within 20 minutes and spend the rest of the class talking with the teacher.<p>There was no drive to excel. There was no &quot;this kid&#x27;s smart, lets focus on him more&quot;. I passed so they didn&#x27;t give a fuck, it meant they could spend more time on the dumb kids and subsequently boost their budgets.",1410019990

For example, an index fund tracking the S&P 500 does it by holding all the shares that comprise the S&P 500.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund</a>",1410019986

HTTPS is widely used, it&#x27;s secure, insanely old/insecure software is not supported. (Ideal outcome)<p>2. HTTPS is widely used, but using SHA1 certs for a little longer so that insanely old/insecure software is supported.<p>3. HTTPS is less widely used, but is secure with SHA2 certs, and insanely old/insecure software is still supported.<p>My concern (and Matthew&#x27;s too I think) is that the aggressive deprecation of SHA1 will put us on a trajectory to outcome 3.  We&#x27;re at a unique point in history right now: there is incredible momentum behind converting sites to HTTPS, even sites that traditionally would not have used HTTPS (such as all static sites).  The SHA1 deprecation might throw a wrench into this and cause site operators to reconsider switching to HTTPS.  If not for this momentum, I&#x27;d agree that aggressively deprecating SHA1 would be the clearly correct course of action, but at this moment in history I&#x27;m deeply ambivalent.  Disrupting the HTTPS momentum would be very sad, especially since switching to HTTPS provides an immediate defense against mass passive eavesdropping.",1410019850

I don't get it.<p>I have gotten good service at Apple stores, and (as in life) it pays to be nice to the person you're dealing with. Overall, however, I find them fairly confusing; hard to find stuff, don't know where to pay, etc.",1227890384

379369,comment,378847,379353,0,0,cfabbro,,,"That's a pretty extreme case and wonderfully framed to back up your assertion, but even it is kinda wrong IMHO.<p>Dating sites in particular tend to promote the values their clients hold.  If it's a dating site where ""wholesome"" is the clients primary value then advertising on a porn website would be detrimental, however a company like adultfriendfinder benefits greatly from advertising on porn websites.<p>What I assumed we were talking about was actual big brands like McDonald's or Nike.  They, unlike dating sites, tend not to be as dependent on their customers moral values and so context isn't as important.",1227889555

Contrary, hand coded oo interface can handle that well. (You can always hand code memcached layer in your own model with MVC framework of course, but here I am arguing that framework should have a universal way to make the utility of memcached invisible)",1227889489

I asked Dell (over their online chat) if it can be replaced and two days later a technician knocked on my door and took care of it. Total time wasted: 10 minutes.<p>PS I didn't even have to pay for the warranty, as you can usually get a 3-year at-home warranty from Dell for free.",1227888547

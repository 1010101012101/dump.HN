They fall into exactly two categories - shorter games that are shallow in their content with low re-playability and longer, more elaborate games for older kids. And I can tell you with certainty that 3-5 year olds is an under-served market.<p>With regards to the app (the paid version of it) - it looks promising, but the test subject is napping. Three things though -<p>(a) the app is lagging heavily on iPad 1. For example, clicking on the ? icon scrolls the page up in jerky increments, it looks like the app is really struggling.<p>(b) the music selection is a no-go. For one, I doubt the classics will fly with my kid, and for two - it will most certainly annoy the hell out of my wife and myself.<p>(c) the ""purchase more"" hooks - I appreciate why you have them, but as a rule of thumb I will do my best to avoid any apps that have in-app purchases. Having for-a-fee options always leads to ""what is that?"", ""why can't I press this button?"" and so on and on. This is a not so subtle form of parent arms' twisting by an app developer and I as a parent passionately hate it.<p>On a more constructive note regarding (c) - add a single option in a config menu ""hide all related to real money"" <i>or</i> let me buy ALL you optionals at once (full unlock) <i>or</i> explain exactly how the accumulation of monsterbucks works.

Most of the savings came from saving bonus checks and not increasing spending when I was promoted.<p>My remark about the car specifically was to point to the fact that almost all of my coworkers were fortunate enough not to have that type of family pressure, so they could afford to get nicer cars (my BMW is a 40K 3-series, for which I could take a lot of deductions because I was running a startup at the time, compared to some of my subordinates driving 160K porsches).

If your interests have changed and what you signed up for is no longer relevant to you, it's the best thing all around.  The company doesn't have to keep trying to send you emails that you don't want which might be getting rejected by your mail server using cryptic messages (for example, major ISPs use some variant of a 4NN response such as Yahoo's 451 message deferred) making your mail server waste resources rejecting messages you don't want.  The sending mail server also keeps retrying until it either gives up as undeliverable or until it eventually gets into your mailbox.  If it makes it to your inbox then you waste your time marking it as spam again.  Or maybe it goes into your spam folder where you waste your time reviewing the messages to ensure there were no false positives.  It also penalizes other users who actually do want to receive the email since that email has a higher likelihood of getting delayed or undelivered because of your actions.<p>By all means mark as spam stuff you didn't opt in to receive.  But marking stuff you did opt in to receive is the digital equivalent of hanging up on your best friend when he calls to see if you'd like to go for your usual weekly coffee.

Someone who works 80 hours is generally better than 2 people who work 40 hours because that one guy has all the aggregated contacts and operational knowledge that would otherwise be divided across two people which would come with the overhead of those two people syncing up and communicating with each other. If this wasn't true, then every company would hire 2 people to work normal hours rather than one person who works twice as much (doctors, HFT, whatever).<p>I actually think that a good model for the way salaries work is with regards $/hours^2. So $500k for 100hr, that means its $50 / hr^2, then 50 hour weeks would get paid $125k, and 25hr weeks would get you $32k. (I actually think that is breaking down once you get down to 25hr though) If you are able to pull $100k working 25 hrs / week then you could be making a lot more than double if you worked 50 hours per week.<p>(I'm assuming you are a software developer or related job.

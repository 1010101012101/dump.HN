You start out immersing for two weeks, have a 20 minute conversation, then two more weeks end loop. This process repeats itself until you've certified yourself a genius or dropped out (in finance that usually means to a consulting or worse a teaching gig) at which point other people immerse themselves thinking about your 20 minutes of wisdom.<p>Ed Prescott (Nobel in econ) had an office down the hall from me, and he was famous for saying things like ""aggregate balance sheets matter"" and much smarter people than I would spend a week trying to parse just what he meant.",1187652267

For example, if I have a bad knee towards the end of my life, if I have European style care I get put in a queue with a small but significant probability I will die before I get the treatment. In the US of A I get it immediately at great expense regardless of how long I will actually use it. <p>I don't know if knee pain made their metrics, but if not it would be a significant expense with zero gain. The article mentions a negligible effect on survivability but even small changes can muck up results when death is involved. For example, if two countries have exactly the same care but one elects not to expensively treat a terminal disease. Those who are treated in the first country may die anyway and if they don't will probably live out their longer lives at a reduced health status. Since they were equal otherwise, the first will have lower health relative to the second even though they have spent more, an apparent scandal.<p>One solution would be to set health status for the prematurely dead to be as though they were very sickly but alive. But how sickly, and how long do these un-dead individuals get to stick around? You're fudging either way, so I'm suspicious of what they actually did.<p>Maybe I should go find the article... or get back to work... /emote is acting conflicted",1187651647

He felt bad because he couldn't make it to the demo day after earlier confirming he would be there.<p>Y Combinator had more companies (19) and more variety. I wish I could have written more about specific Y Combinator companies, but we were asked by Paul not to write about them unless they were already launched. Many of them were further along than the TechStars companies. <p>The good news is I saw several good teams at both Y Combinator and TechStars. Some significant winners will emerge.",1187651426

I consider it a must read for anyone who is going to be looking into using Erlang. I had a beta copy of it about two months before it was published and it helped me tremendously by simplifying some of the design patterns I had constructed myself.<p>Also, if I had to complain about Erlang at all the documentation is the one thing I would complain about. I find so many useful features by reading the source code (which also makes my own code better by reading other peoples code) that are not documented that I often wonder who is choosing what to document and what not to.<p>For instance, the to_lower() function to make a string lower case is in the http_util module, instead of the string module. Took me six months to find it and I had written my own in the mean time, theirs is much more efficient, but all but undocumented.",1187651219

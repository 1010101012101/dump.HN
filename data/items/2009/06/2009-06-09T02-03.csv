Bicycles get stolen like nothing else in a lot of places. In cities where bicycle transport is common (The places I have experienced this have been Amsterdam & Beijing), they seem to have arrived at an inelegant solution to this: Cheap bikes you can afford to lose. That way you can rely on a combination of crappy wheel lok (no need to tie to a pole), low resale value & indifference to losing a bike or two a year.<p>For me, this is what keeps me from replacing my driving with cycling more often.",1244516066

648440,comment,648317,648368,0,0,patio11,,,"I would go the other way on that -- overwhelmingly, your customers want to get their music streamed, NOT get a pretty wrapper around a separate service that is way the heck over their technical skill level which they nonetheless have to understand.  If I were you, I'd see if you could possibly structure it such that a) they paid you in advance and b) you stored all the music on YOUR S3 account, which is then an implementation detail that no one has to care about.<p>Now, of course, the obvious worry with this is the major advantage for your service is ""If you use us, you can listen to music without having to pay for it"", which is pretty much the selling point of every Internet music based startup I've ever heard of, and you'd probably prefer to structure things in such a way that you don't know that 90% of your customers are using your app as a convenient pirating service, because that will result in less legal hassles.<p>This is why hell will freeze over before Apple integrates any sort of cloud offering with their iPods.  As long as they can't see the contents of their hard drive, they can continue with the polite fiction that their hipster twenty-somethings are filling those eight gigabytes with music they've either purchased legitimately or which is licensed appropriately.<p>More broadly I think the challenge with startups in the music space is coming up with a value proposition which is not ""Using this service is a lot cheaper than paying for your music"".",1244515700

648401,comment,648061,648355,0,0,patio11,,,"Conversion tracking:<p>It is close to trivial to get a basic level of conversion tracking established -- copy/paste some Javascript into a page which probably already exists in your conversion funnel.  Back in 2007 Google's conversion tracking had some accuracy issues (i.e. it was nowhere close to what my numbers were -- counting 50% of transactions whereas I expected 90% of customers to see the page I was counting at).  That has since cleared up.<p>Fear of autopilot:<p>They have pretty comprehensive budgeting control (you set it in terms of a per-day thing, but that is basically a marketing-friendly wrapper around a per-month budget).  That lets you sharply limit the risk -- I think at the start I had a daily budget of $10, which means if the process went out of control for a month I'd be out at most $300 when I got the next bill and terminated it.  They've since performed well enough that I've adjusted my budget upwards several times until they were unable to spend most of it.  (The default for AdWords is to adjust your bidding to spend up to your budget -- for example, if you have $500 unspent, they'll adjust your bids upwards to get you more clicks and spend that last $500.  This default is in Google's interests, but not in yours, because it will result in you paying absolutely stupid per-conversion costs at the end.)<p>For this Halloween I'd feel comfortable authorizing them to spend several thousand dollars.  (Halloween is my best season and its the only one where my ads ever get budget-constrained.)<p>Ways it could have been easier:<p>Conversion Optimizer is about as easy as I could want it to be.  AdWords, hmm... I'd like there to be a clone of me who I can get to write creatives (that is advertiser-speak for ads and landing pages) and check if they're performing well without me having to actually do it.  Everything about quality score could be more transparent, particularly for newbies to the system.<p>Changes to improve ROI:<p>I've always got ideas for this, I just don't have nearly enough time to implement and rigorously test them all.  My big project right now is turning my desktop application into a web app, which I think will result in a substantial across-the-board increase in conversions due to the elimination of the download, install, execute cycle and the possibility to collect email addresses to implement an autoresponder & etc.",1244513783

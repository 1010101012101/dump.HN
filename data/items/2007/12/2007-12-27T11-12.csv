Nothing quite like self made men who stay grounded.<p>There's one thing I'm conflicted about when it comes to the idea of creating jobs for so many people like this. It just seems so close to modern day feudalism. There are some <i>significant</i> differences obviously, and there's probably nothing immoral about the modern version. Ultimately though there's essentially a king (owner), his knights (directors), and the peasants (workers). This guy may have been a benevolent dictator, but his death puts all of those people's future at risk. If the new CEO isn't as smart and ethical (likely) they're in for harder times because they put their livelihoods in his hands.<p>I think I would feel much better about enabling 100 families to become financially independent for the rest of their lives than supporting 10,000 dependents for N years.",1198756056

2934019,comment,2932858,2932858,2,0,jfasi,,,"I think the reason is both technical and social.<p>The JVM has a very hard time integrating existing C code and extensions. For instance, in the case of python, Jython lacks the ability to take advantage of the significant number of modules written in C.<p>Consider what this means for performance. Imagine a pure python module that attempts to import a C submodule for performance, and falls back on on the pure python implementation specifically to allow it to run on non-CPython implementations. json is an example of such a module.<p>This module was likely engineered and architected with C module optimization in mind. I'd assert that in most cases the pure python module is a crutch to allow a CPython-targeting module to run on other implementations.<p>This leads into the social reason. Community takes a long time to build and using the JVM for dynamic languages is a relatively new trend. The JVM is a very mature, well-optimied technology for static languages. It is only now that dynamic languages are starting to gain traction on it.",1314543334

It costs a lot to produce high-quality content.<p>Both are wrong. Many people would happily pay for high-quality content if they had to pay for it. Newspapers and magazines were hugely successful for years before the internet.<p>The real problem is #2. The internet has drastically lowered the barrier to entry for experts to publish content. Some of the best information I got on timely content, like Libya and Fukishima, were from blogs that I am unlikely to ever read again. People freely publish information every day about any subject you can imagine, and it keeps me quite satisfied.<p>I'm not unwilling to pay because I'm a stubborn scrooge, I'm unwilling to pay because I don't need to pay!<p>That said, there are plenty of content distributors who do well thanks to advertising. High-quality blogging can also server as a marketing tool, drawing potential consumers through viral and search marketing.

Google (and other companies) control what emails get through to you and your email history.

I upgraded the memory to 6gb (had some lying around) and switched the 5400rpm drive for a 7200rpm. When I have the cash to spare, I'll put in 8gb and a SSD which should speed it up more. I run CrunchbangLinux (debian + xfce) upgraded to Sid repos instead of Squeeze. The only problems I have with it are the video switching can be a pain (solved with a bios mod that lets you disable the ati card, which I don't really use much at all) & the usual annoying broadcom wireless that means you need to connect wired to get the driver the first time or have the .debs downloaded first.<p>The model is a bit older now but the specs are good and you can probably find them quite cheap now. There is also a second gen version (3830 i think is model?) that has most of the same specs except second gen i5, usb 3 & i think nvidia instead of ati video.",1314541208

The only thing I'd warn you is that when you're doing heavy work (video encoding or lots of heavy compilation/running) or heavy play (lots of flash), the battery life will probably be just under 5. Not at all like the 7 they claim, which is really only for casual surfing where the processor is bored out of its mind.<p>(I have the same i5 13"", it's been great)",1314541185

""chomps"" the input (which here means: removes newlines (if present) from each line, more general explanation:\n<a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/chomp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/chomp.html</a>\n2. and automatically adds a newline to each output newline (see below how to achieve this in a shorter way with a relatively new Perl feature).<p>-a: turns on auto-split-mode: this splits the input (like awk) into the @F (for fields) array. The default separator is one (or many) spaces, i.e. it behaves like AWK.<p>-n: makes Perl process the input in an implicit while loop around the input, which is processed line-wise: ""as long as there is another line, process it!""<p>-e: execute the next command line argument as a Perl program (argument in this case beeing 'print $F[0]').<p>Note that the example can be shortened if you use\n-E instead of -e. -E enables all extensions and new features of Perl (which aren't enabled with -e because of backwards compatibility). This allows you to use 'say' instead of 'print' which adds a trailing newline automatically and lets you drop the -l option (if you don't need the 'chomp' behaviour explained above):<p><pre><code>    $ perl -anE 'say $F[0]'\n</code></pre>\nOf course, the AWK command line is still shorter - and that's expected, because AWK is more specialized than Perl.<p>Still, Perl one liners are often very useful and can do other things better / shorter than AWK - especially if the one-liner uses one of the many libraries that are available for Perl.<p>A thorough reference of all Perl command line options is available at:<p><pre><code>    http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html\n</code></pre>\nor just:<p><pre><code>    $ man perlrun</code></pre>",1314540768

So your contribution to the world economy would be $423.5 billion over 10 years. At that scale, getting $58M is really nothing. In fact, only getting $58M back for $423.5 billion of contribution smells like communism.",1314540505

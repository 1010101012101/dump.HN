Some implementations use dedicated logic, while others leverage the arrays of shader processors in modern graphics chips. Turns out all this hardware-accelerated mojo may be no better than old-school software transcoding. We've put together a detailed comparison of video transcoding on the PC that explores everything from performance to image quality to power consumption.  The verdict: software transcoding consistently produces the highest-quality results. If you can live with artifacts, the QuickSync logic built into Intel's recent CPUs is easily the fastest of the hardware-accelerated solutions, though the output quality varies widely with the software used. A beta version of the OpenCL-accelerated x264 encoder produces good results on multiple hardware configurations, but it's not much faster than pure software transcoding on a modern CPU.",1343685134

Reply following approach by Google (due to Stackoverflow etc), then rejection on sending CV.<p>Thoughts? Do you hire non-degree holders?<p>---<p>Hi (HR person),<p>Thank you for your reply. I had to think about this for a bit, as Google is the first company/client I have ever had ask about my degree (or lack of).<p>Unlike other disciplines like mechanical engineering or architecture, we programmers can start at an early age building virtual things, exploring complexity and simplicity. Many of us spend a considerable amount of time studying the science, rather than just coding.<p>I have had a lot of exposure to CS graduates over the past year, at a highly regarded UK university. Of those I encountered, most of students were doing it because they were bright and didn't know what to do with themselves. Some ""downgraded"" (as they saw it) from maths or physics because it was harder than they thought. Of the remainder, half were ego driven coders and half were actually any good. The very few that were good nearly dropped out because they were not excited enough (and some of them even ended up coding cool things alongside me).<p>You can't build amazing things without science, and the Internet means I don't require a degree to learn the science to build cool things. I can do that on my PC, right here, very cheaply and efficiently.<p>I do accept that the cost of exploring what excites you most without the formal structure of a degree has its costs (such as being filtered out of Google's hiring process) ... despite this I wouldn't go back and earn a degree if I had a time machine, so that's a cost I happily accept.<p>One of the beautiful things about programming is its immediate availability to all who want to learn ... even those who decide to do things differently.<p>I hope Google would in future take a longer look at people learning on their own steam, in their own time and out of love.<p>Regardless, I've very much enjoyed talking with you and I hope you find great candidates for the positions.<p>Thank you for your time!

4314683,comment,4312731,4314219,16,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, this is why people don't take you seriously.<p>I know a couple of guys like you in my local activist community, who take a very hostile ""I know the truth and you're all fools!"" attitude, despite the fact that their audience is mostly very sympathetic to most of their assertions. We <i>know</i> spying on the Internet takes place; HN is full of cantankerous old Internet geeks who've seen, first-hand, plenty of examples of the state (whatever state you may choose, as it happens all over the world) behaving unethically on the Internet, spying on people and punishing people for things that shouldn't be crimes.<p>But, your paranoid approach is counter-productive. You might as well be working for the people you claim to be afraid of, for all the good you do (negative good; you're convincing people that the folks who believe the government is spying are all paranoid nutjobs who scream at anyone who has the gall to mention other possible explanations).<p>So, let's review:<p>1. Just because spying has taken place, and is currently taking place, and may even have the complicity of facebook in that spying, it does not mean that facebook is running a botnet to steal advertiser dollars. The simplest explanation is that facebook looks the other way while <i>others</i> run the botnets. facebook wins (a lot, as long as most advertisers don't know it's happening), botnet owner wins (a little), and the advertiser loses. But, there are other plausible explanations, including incompetence.<p>2. When you paint things in a ""Either you accept my theory in its entirety, or you're all idiots"", you force people to choose a side. Nobody wants to be on the same side as an asshole, so you force them to choose the other side. You make people who may even agree with you (to a greater or lesser degree) to begin to formulate plausible reasons for why you're wrong about the crazier stuff you're spouting...further convincing themselves that you're <i>entirely</i> wrong. The <i>best</i> you can hope for is people ignore you and don't have the chance to be inoculated against your ideas; having you as their first exposure to these concepts guarantees they will be less likely to believe them in the future, even if they come from a more credible source. Humans are funny creatures.<p>Thus, I would point out that there are some really naive and stupid people on HN that have zero grasp of effective argument, persuasion, and even basic logic.<p>You might be well-served by reading about non-violent communication: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication</a><p>Edit: Removed the word ""schizophrenic"" as it was an insensitive use of the term, and was counter-productive to making my point.",1343682349

You don't advertise only on Google or only on Facebook; as much as your budget allows, you advertise on every channel you can achieve a positive ROI on.<p>For any advertiser looking for a direct response, like a signup or purchase, I doubt anything Facebook can do would make the ROI better than advertising on search. No amount of demographic and interest targeting will make advertising to people as effective as advertising to intent. You can pay Google to send you people while they're in the process of looking for your product; Facebook doesn't do that.",1343682348

A form of terrorism that has been quite rare in the West, despite all of the publicity.<p>If you look, you'll find plenty of non-suicide attacks; and the suicide attacks are not all Islamic - the Tamil Tigers (1979-2009) are an excellent example of terrorist failure.<p>> And one could argue that those have been quite successful so far: with only a few successful attempts, they've gotten our full, almost daily, attention for over a decade now.<p>Well, I'm glad their ambitions were just to beat Snooki in ratings - like Osama bin Laden before his late demise, they can take consolation in watching Fox News.",1343682253

Possibly.  I&#x27;d say that is left up to the individual implementor.  We don&#x27;t need to all literally agree on a list of individuals to blackball.  A general trend across some subset of the community would do just fine.  Some people may take it to the extreme, some may only dissociate from a narrowly defined group of people.  This sort of social tension, or pressure, doesn&#x27;t need to be engineered with exacting precision.

In fact I think that would explain a lot of the reaction on all sides.<p>E.g. when we allow the FBI to wiretap people pursuant to a lawfully-issued warrant, that&#x27;s in reality done with the understanding that the FBI had the <i>technical</i> capability to execute that wiretap, warrant or not. The warrant isn&#x27;t technically required anymore, it&#x27;s only a procedural safeguard. But most people do not necessarily spend a lot of time thinking about how the FBI could be listening to all of their phone calls, since they know that they are not actually being targeted in practice.<p>So it is on what is truly a global Internet. The IP packets don&#x27;t go flying around with &quot;I&#x27;m an American&quot; bits set, so in the end the only real safeguard if you&#x27;re going to try to mine data of national interest from the Internet is procedural. At best technical safeguards could be used within the NSA&#x27;s various data warehouses after collection has occurred, but there&#x27;s no way to get around the fact that American and non-American data is intermingled everywhere on the Internet.<p>Is this a satisfactory state of affairs? Nope! If you&#x27;re a privacy advocate you might say that the response is to simply stop collecting intelligence at all and accept all the consequences that follow from that. If you&#x27;re kind of in the middle you might want to add more oversight, transparency and other safeguards to retain the ability to gain intelligence (not just for counter-terrorism, but for everything the nation needs it for), while not risking mass abuse of civil liberties by differenting definitions of &quot;targeting&quot;.<p>But the sea change was not the NSA deciding to spy on Americans, it was Americans deciding to join the rest of the world on a global network, a problem the NSA didn&#x27;t previously have to really sort through. I won&#x27;t say I agree with all the inventive ways they&#x27;ve found to try to collect intelligence, but nor do I think that there is some directed effort by NSA to violate American civil liberties as a goal in and of itself.<p>You&#x27;re right that &quot;terrorism!&quot; has been their go-to reasoning in the public eye, but to be fair that is one of the big things the people are large are concerned with and, to parrot the top comment on this thread, the full truth about diplomatic cloak-and-dagger games is rather nuanced.",1384227082

6715668,comment,6714371,6714786,4,0,pmjordan,,,"<i>I do assume using goroutines is slower than multiplexing though, but still plenty fast.</i><p>Surely, the goroutine model is just an abstraction <i>built on</i> multiplexing? As in, it uses the exact same syscalls that a multiplexing server written in C would use, except instead of storing state explicitly in a connection structure, it&#x27;s stored implicitly in the goroutine&#x27;s stack. The main (only?) real difference is code structure and thus the dispatch mechanism to where in the connection handling code processing should resume: In the goroutine, you&#x27;re literally storing the instruction pointer and jumping straight to it. In the hand-written case, you&#x27;ll probably go through some buffering code and an explicit state machine.<p>Basically, Go and its goroutines save you reinventing the connection state capture and resuming code for every single protocol you implement - it comes for free as part of the language. (you can make C do similar things with makecontext/swapcontext plus some extra plumbing code of course) Performance wise it should be a pretty close call: resuming a goroutine will presumably cause a branch prediction miss (due to the change in function return pointer), whereas the multiplexed code will need to wind its way through the state machine logic - almost certainly also a branch prediction miss. CPU cache behaviour should likewise be similar (you&#x27;re storing the same state either way).",1384226756

For example in a system like this, someone who is an amazing programmer who spends more time making everyone around him smart than writing features doesn&#x27;t have to rank lower than someone who quietly sits by himself writing a ton of feature code. That, plus no expectation/forcing of a certain distribution (e.g. the 10% lowest scoring people aren&#x27;t necessarily shit, they could all be adequate in terms of value and deserving of a solid bonus, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re not as high as the folks above them) are what makes the process truly work and keeps confidence/trust in the system high (as well as the fact that all employees participate in the process.)",1384226111

If you imagine a language that lacks finalization functionality but has automatic memory reclamation, things turn out okay.<p>Not in fault-tolerant message passing systems, to name just one obvious example. Suppose that you put a bunch of file objects into a buffered channel, and then the goroutine that was supposed to receive those objects panics. Your program wants to recover from panics with recover(). Who closes the file descriptors in those channels? Nobody owns them yet: they were in a channel and the goroutine that was supposed to receive them died.<p>You might be able to solve this by handing out references to the channel to another goroutine that is supposed to clean up the file descriptors, but this gets really complicated. This sort of thing is why Go is GC&#x27;d in the first place. It&#x27;s much easier to just have the GC clean up the file descriptors in channels in which one endpoint has gone dead, and that&#x27;s the sort of thing finalizers are for and I assume it&#x27;s the reason that finalizers were built into Go.",1384226015

119782,comment,119360,119745,0,0,airhadoken,,,"Thank you parent poster. This was the other part I wanted to cover in my post above but didn't think I could find hard data for.  It seems like the contracting business has attracted large amounts of ethically-challenged scum, who are building houses that aren't likely to last as long as the mortgages paying for them.

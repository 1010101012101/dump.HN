764239,comment,764033,764224,0,0,chrischen,,,"The whole benefit of open source is so that stuff can be openly improved. If Chrome has a better javascript engine, then why not firefox and safari adopt it? They could always improve the Chrome version afterwards anyways (I'm assuming the V8 engine is indeed better). There really are only two browsers duking it out, Internet Explorer and the open source browser. Why? Because open source has no barriers to adopting it's own technology and can be considered one entity in theory. If one javascript engine is clearly superior why waste effort developing seperate open source implementations? It's not like the user interface where someone might prefer the style of firefox's javascript rendering over Chrome's. Competition even in open source is natural and should be encouraged, but they don't have to necessarily compete to improve. They can build <i>on top</i> of each other.",1250301443

Lots of people complain about their iPhones, and i HATE my mac, but get railed for saying so (and I fully expect to get down voted here for saying it). 
Part of the Apple marketing magic is droning on about how great they are, and it seems to me most people go along with that.<p>I'm not saying the iPhone isn't a great device, but I don't think you can rely on these kinds of stats when you are talking about one company with a cult-like following and another that is just trying to get back after years of mis-steps.",1250301439
764237,comment,763329,763521,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>And then there's Taiwan. It has always been a country of small and medium sized businesses</i><p>Yes. This was one of the most striking differences between Taiwan and the Republic of Korea during the 1980s, as each country was ""graduating"" from the Third World into the First World as newly industrialized countries. Taiwan had many small businesses, many of them family businesses employing family members, while Korea had a smallish number of huge conglomerates, employing tens of thousands. There were exceptions to the general pattern in each country, of course, but that was the systematic difference between Taiwan and Korea. Each country thrived with its own economic pattern. Each democratized, even more peacefully in Taiwan than in Korea, over the same period.<p>In Taiwan, an ancient Chinese proverb is often quoted, sometimes in somewhat modernized form: 寧為雞頭，不為牛後 ""better to be the head of a chicken than the rear of a buffalo."" A lot of Taiwanese people cherish being business managers rather than employees, and indeed my wife (from Taiwan) has been a small business owner most of her life. She wouldn't want to be someone else's employee just to have more secure employment--she likes making her own business decisions.",1250301395

And in February, the Division of Civil Rights found probable cause that a ladies'-night ad in Westword had discriminated against Horner although just a year earlier, the same director at the same division had determined that a ladies'-night ad in the Denver Post had not discriminated against Horner, and in his determination cited the judge's ruling in our Denver County Court case, a ruling that exempted newspapers.<p><a href=""http://www.westword.com/2009-05-21/news/steve-horner-doesn-t-even-live-here-so-how-can-we-discriminate-against-him/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.westword.com/2009-05-21/news/steve-horner-doesn-t...</a><p><a href=""http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/10683429/detail.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/10683429/detail.html</a>",1250300975

At my local Whole Foods, the bike rack is usually filled with 30 or more bicycles.  (Mostly employees, I assume, but I'm sure I'm not the only person that uses his bicycle for grocery shopping.)  Inside, people seem to be thinner than the average shopper at Jewel down the street.  (If you want highly-processed foods, that is where to find them -- everything is highly processed.  So while Whole Foods may not be perfect, it's orders of magnitude better than ""normal"" grocery stores.)<p>I agree that Whole Foods has a lot of ""unhealthy"" food.  If you eat nothing but steak, yeah, that's bad.  But if you eat it once a month, it's better to buy a good one from a cow that was not pumped full of antibiotics and that ate what nature intended it to eat.<p>I am not sure that Whole Foods has a lot of ""highly-processed carbs"", though, so it would be good if you could clarify that.  Sure, you can buy pasta there, but I consider that ""minimally processed"".<p>In addition to all that, they do have a lot of healthy food available that you can't find elsewhere.

764212,comment,755365,763207,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"I don't know, I typed a long response but I can't really express what I want to say.  I didn't diagnose you.<p>The ability to concentrate very intensively for hours on difficult material is not a common trait (in the population at large).<p>Feeling 'bored' enough that you avoid going to class despite all the extra work this implies, and the grade implications, is not a common trait (among people who hope to go to a good graduate school).<p>However, for someone with ADD, both hyperfocusing on things they find very interesting, and avoiding situations that require sustained attention on anything that they don't find especially interesting would be almost a given.  More then a given, these are symptoms.<p>Finally, something can be a valid explanation of why an action was the right one, but still be a rationalization if it doesn't take into account the true motives behind the decision to take the action.  There is certainly a school of thought that says basically all explanations (both before and after a decision) are at least in part rationalizations, since we do not know our true motivations at all.<p>So I believe you 100% when you say you ""used your time to your best advantage"", but I believe you came to this course of action, at least partly,  to give yourself an excuse for avoiding unpleasant feelings of boredom, even though it is clearly expected for students to attend class.<p>Finally, you continually state it as though you had to choose one, read up on research or go to classes you found boring.<p>Here is why your explanation doesn't convince me:<p>Classes take up 12-16 hours per week, so skipping them gives you 12-16 hours of extra time studying important things. Awesome! That is a good thing, I'm not being sarcastic.<p>Add commute time, meals on campus, conversations and other crap, now we are at 14-28 hours per week, which is sizable.<p>However, sometimes you can't skip a class, do to tests or turning in papers, so subtract a few hours per week from your 'time gained'. Maybe we are at 10-24 hours per week gained now. (Guessing around 4 hours combined of class time + overhead of commuting etc that is unavoidable per week)<p>In most classes you could sit and read whatever you want the entire time, while still benefiting from being there and recognized by the professor (good if you need anything from him later, also this unfairly effects your grade) and are aware of homework, readings, and at least partially of discussions and what the professor cares about.  You may also find that you are more interested than you thought you were, and the class is no longer considered 'wasted time'.  Once you take away time 'reading what you want' in the lecture, and 'unexpected interest in subject' time, maybe you are at 2-18 hours gained now.  (Guessing around 6-8 hours per week can be spent reading what you want, unexpected interest in a subject cannot be estimated.)<p>Now subtract any commute time you do regardless of class attendance.  For example, if you are a commuter and you have to attend one class, go to the library, or talk to a professor, you have to do the full commute regardless of class attendance. I estimated between 1 and 8 hours of commuting time per week.  If you end up going to campus every day, or you live on or near the campus anyway, you are down to between 0 and 10 hours of 'time wasted' per week.  You cannot say that even the maximum possible 10 hours gained per week is some kind of deal breaker to studying on your own.<p>So that is my thought process when I read your initial post.  Then I thought, if this person isn't <i>really</i> gaining much time to study by skipping class, why do they feel so strongly about it?<p>So an unconvincing explanation of why, a statement that those classes are 'boring', a statement that if you had to attend those classes you probably would have quit school (they must be pretty unpleasant to you!) all adds up a high likelihood of ADD <i>to me</i>.  Your analysis may be different, but given the limited facts I have available I am  convinced.  This is not a diagnosis, merely a statement of how it seems to me.",1250299817

And then, if you are good middleman and know how to deal with government you can ensure that nothing of much importance comes later.<p>I don't know, maybe I am cynical. Maybe these guys really care for transparency and want government to start releasing data in bulk so that as much data as possible gets released as cheaply as possible. So maybe I am wrong.<p>Then again maybe not. If you wanted open government above all you would not mind much about exactly what format the data came in.<p>And the fact that you just flamed me and accused me of trolling out of the blue, makes me even more doubtful the motives of the original article's drafter are honest.",1250298714

I'll just pick on your 2nd paragraph:<p><i>""Now, I’m not one to claim to know what filthy rich is all about, but I do know what it takes to be one; dedication, imagination, faith, and some luck. Do I desire to be filthy rich? Sure I do; who doesn’t?""</i><p>I don't. And I'm sure there's plenty of other people on HN who don't. Not all wealthy people got to where they are because it was a desire they actively strove for. Personally, my startup is able to pay me far more than I need or have ever desired earning. Aside from some material comforts/luxuries, my life is no better because of my income (my wife might disagree ;) ).<p>About your statement that it takes ""<i>some luck</i>"" to be filthy rich, here's a quote from <i>What Should a Billionaire Give–and What Should You?</i> by Peter Singer:<p><i>""The Nobel Prize-winning economist and social scientist Herbert Simon estimated that “social capital” is responsible for at least 90 percent of what people earn in wealthy societies like those of the United States or northwestern Europe. By social capital Simon meant not only natural resources but, more important, the technology and organizational skills in the community, and the presence of good government. These are the foundation on which the rich can begin their work.""</i><p>In other words, the amount of money you're going to earn in your lifetime will be determined by more than ""some"" luck. All the dedication, faith, and imagination in the world can't change when, where, and to whom you were born.<p>I'd suggest you take a step back and ask yourself ""why do I desire to be rich?"" If you haven't yet, I'd recommend reading Felix Dennis's book (""How to Get Rich""). It's a great read and one of the points he repeats is that money alone will not make you happy.<p>Cheers.",1250298713

Of course knowing C would help one to understand how Ruby, Python, etc. work, just like knowing assembler helps one to understand what C is doing.

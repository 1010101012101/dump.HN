Erlang is certainly catching on.  Can't speak for Clojure.<p>I learned Scala and erlang.  Did a real world webapp with erlang 5 years ago before it was noticeably cool.  Didn't  me make any money aside from the one project (I chose the tech myself simply out of interest).  Both scala and erlang helped me be a better programmer and renew my flagging interests.  Other than that, I haven't seen any financial profits from it.  I'm using ruby now simply because I have webapps to run and its the simplest way to get the job done.<p>Previous comments that people that learn these langs are putting themselves in better company are on target.",1252655967

Seems more likely to be a reactive criticism against Darwin, but (not having read the book, only the intro) provided it makes VALID points that need to be considered, it will (hopefully) aid our understanding as to how we got here, and where we may end up going...",1252655884

But I wouldn't mind a prepaid model so much. IE, I pay for a month or six upfront and then pay again to renew.

Your data is presented on your eyebrowse profile in the form of interesting and insightful visualizations, allowing you to gain personal and social insights and catch a glimpse of what Google knows about you.<p>Currently, most web browsing data is collected by search engine companies (Google, Microsoft, Alexaâ€¦), which is hardly available for public domain research. Eyebrowse seeks to fill this gap by providing a public repository of web trails. By making this data available, we hope to support the creation of open public services that analyze and report major trends on the web, services that support personalization of the web through collaborative filtering and other crowd-sourcing techniques, and other as-yet unimagined services that require a mass of data about the world's interaction with the web.<p>Check out some real live profiles and our page stats graphs, which are accessible from any page via the plug-in.<p>Eyebrowse is an open source project hosted on Google Code implemented using Django, Javascript and HTML5. It is actively seeking users for feedback and beta testing.<p>happy surfing!

Emphasize how much you'd like to work with them, and how much you think you're going to learn. Don't try to sell yourself - nobody cares. You're boring to to other people, no one cares about you. Instead, tell them about themselves, about what you like about them, what you admire about them, and what an honor it would be to make them the first person you contract for. Tell them that you expect to make some mistakes for a lack of experience, but you're working to work 130% to make them very happy, and that working for an undermarket price would be a tremendous opportunity for you to learn alongside someone who is a veteran.<p>Again, DON'T SELL YOURSELF. No one cares. Tell the person you're taking to about themself. Tell them what you like and love about them, and then tell them how you'd like to help them, and what an honor it would be, and how much you expect to learn. Let them know you're doing it for a very selfish reason - so that you can learn from them.<p>It's key you legitimately respect whoever it is, because you'll sound empty if not, and you <i>are</i> going to make a million mistakes that are very obvious in hindsight. So find someone you really respect, and talk about them (not yourself - no one cares, really), and then make damn sure they know they're getting 130% effort for 30% price or so. The lessons and reference from someone you respect are going to be worth a heck of a lot more than whatever you could get by trying to over-represent yourself to an unsophisticated buyer.<p>To work with someone very talented, they'll want to know that you're mentally and emotionally onboard and very excited to work with them personally, and that your effort will make up for your inexperience. The enthusiasm is what gets them willing to give you a chance, the undermarket rates is what gets you the contract. Later on, you can raise your rates, but do try to make the first person you get someone you really admire - bad clients are really a nightmare, and you'll have to deal with that later, but good clients are like mana from heaven. Do what you can to get people you really truly, deeply respect for your first gigs, even if it's a bit less than you could get on the open market. It'll be very worth it in the long run.",1252655276

Unfortunately, I think it's just too far beyond people's understanding of technology.<p>The interesting thing about it for me is that this advancement, this creation of humans, is feared. It tells us a lot about ourselves. Why do we fear what we create? Why do we fear advancement?  When we watch movies about the future, the Terminators and such, they're all bleak.<p>And because of this fear, we disregard the future. We deny it or abandon thoughts of it.  In doing so, we leave serious contemplation of these technologies to those who are using it ways that <i>should</i> be feared.  We're building killing robots and unmanned drones -- exactly the thing of our nightmare scenarios.<p>Instead, we should be reducing our use of advanced technologies to cause harm to humanity.  Without serious discussion of the ramifications, we are leaving decisions to the unconscious, to the short term thinkers who will use the technology in the quest for world domination.",1252654501

1008945,comment,1008601,1008819,0,0,hugh_,,,"<i>I think just the fact that so many are now considering the position of the poor facing moral choices of theft or starvation makes this an excellent sermon.</i><p>When was the last time anybody actually managed to starve to death in Great Britain? Great Britain is already a welfare state. It's easy to get paid for not working. If you fall through the cracks of that system there are dozens of charities devoted to helping those in genuine need. In addition, there's a beggar on every street corner. Oh, and there's always the Church, which really should be working on feeding the hungry itself (perhaps by reducing its own gold-plated candelabra budget) instead of sending 'em to knock over Tesco's.<p>Finally, if you somehow manage to be completely unable to find food <i>anywhere</i>, and you haven't eaten for days and you're actually in danger of dying of starvation, all you need to do is go to hospital, where they'll say ""hey, this guy is dying of starvation"" and give you free food and medical treatment.<p>In conclusion, dying for lack of food in modern Britain is very, very difficult.",1261439942

1008938,comment,1008382,1008705,0,0,bphogan,,,"There are a lot of web application developers out there don't have a clue how to build accessible web applications. JS is <i>not</i> required to log in to sites, nor is it required to send data back to the server. But devs do it because they see other sites do it, and rather than learn how to do it the right way, they just do it the way they see how.  Blind and low-vision users disable JS too, because it prevents popups from taking focus, and prevents mouseover events that can also mess with people who have motor impairments.<p>Javascript is a great way to enhance the user experience, but you are being irresponsible if you develop sites that only work with JS enabled. It's seriously not that hard. Make it work first, then detect xhr on the server to add the nice partial updates, etc. And don't tell me it costs more money to do that. If it does, you designed it wrong or chose tools that are inherently inaccessible. In both cases the blame falls on you.<p>Full disclosure; I am a low-vision web application developer, born with congenital cataracts, along with my father and my daughter. Developers who use the excuse of ""you have to have JS on for my stuff to work"" make me incredibly angry, so I tried to keep this as civil as possible.",1261439814

1008932,comment,1008646,1008878,0,0,pyre,,,"> <i>Simply put, I do not buy the idea that by being vegetarian I'm doing significantly less harm - I may be one slight degree more removed from the animal that has to die to put food on my plate, but morally it makes little difference, and technically it makes even less difference.</i><p>Those animals are going to be mauled by the machinery <i>anyways</i>. You are not saving them from the mauling by eating meat. If you avoid animal products or at least limit your consumption of them, you are reducing the demand to produce these products, thereby reducing the amount of animals that are ravaged by our industrialized food engine. While this might not seem to make a noticeable different due to our ever-increasing population, were all the vegetarians/vegans out there to revert back into omnivores demanding meat/dairy/eggs a resulting ramping up of production to meet this demand would occur.<p>There are two points that I have with your argument:<p>1. Animals that are ripped to shreds by farming equipment are at least able to live a 'free' life in the wild. Animals that are part of the industrialized livestock industry commonly live in cages where they can't even turn around. Sometimes their flesh melds into the cage walls (as can be the case with egg-laying chickens) completely grafting them to their cage (i.e. hens whose feet have grown <i>around</i> the bars/wire of their cage floor leaving them permanently fixed to the cage).<p>2. The idea that ""well animals are going to die anyways so why even bother"" is not an attitude that I find healthy or conducive to change.<p>> <i>I object against this presumptuous attitude. Plenty of us meat-eaters ask these questions - and we decide to continue being omnivores while being entire conscious of its consequences (as well as the myriad of negative consequences of pure vegetarianism). ""Them ignorant meat eaters"" is all too common a presumptuous attitude I get from self-righteous vegetarians. Thanks for portraying us as a bunch of ostriches with heads in the sand, while heroic vegetarians lead the way. On, comrades!</i><p>I apologize if I came off that way. Most of the time when expressing your views as a vegetarian or a vegan all you get are responses like, ""I'm going to eat <i>TWICE</i> as much meat just to offset your moral choice! Haw haw haw!"" And I agree that there are people that have at least weighed these ideas and have made the choice to eat meat. I applaud you for doing so.<p>There are plenty of people that think of the topic as 'taboo' because it's 'unsightly.' I've met people that don't go to petting zoos because they don't want to <i>see</i> the farm animals that they are eating when they eat meat. The idea that they might associate the meat with the face of an animal frightens them because it means that they might end up with a moral dilemma. I have relatives that don't want to hear about the conditions in the slaughterhouses because it would make it hard for them to eat meat. I have a huge loss of respect for these people.<p>Update: I should add that I don't 'look down' on people that eat meat like a lot of vegans/vegetarians do. Though I may have come off as having a self-righteous attitude, I don't. Unlike a lot of vegans, I don't have an extremist attitude. If we were able to ween ourselves off of the heavy dependence that we have on animals (at least in food) I think that we would be in a much better place morally and nutritionally as a society (though I am <i>not</i> of the mind that a vegan diet is 'automatically' healthy like some people seem to believe; there are tons of unhealthy foods that are perfectly vegan).",1261439605

1008893,comment,1008410,1008610,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I'm thoroughly enjoying this discussion, because it's forcing me to challenge my assumptions and think things through. Before I respond, let me clarify - there's general game theory which I'll mention, and there's my opinions on governance, and I try to keep them largely separate. Your comment mixes your thoughts on both a little bit, but I'm happy to weigh in on both topics. I'll try to note which I'm weighing in on - I mention this because game theory type analysis is less subjective than figuring out what ""good governance"" is, which is a lot more open to opinion and interpretation. But I enjoy both topics and am happy to weigh in on both.<p>> Now, the way you tell the story, it's the legislators' fault for the secondary effect of amending the law causing Google to leave.<p>I try not to make moral judgments when pointing out consequences - I wouldn't call it ""fault"", so much as simply saying it happens. I find words like fault/blame, fair/unfair, good/bad, good/evil, and so on cloud a discussion. I'm more interested in finding out what's going to happen in a given scenario first, and then once we have all the data, then come to a decision. So I wouldn't say it's a legislator's ""fault"", I would simply say it's an unintended consequence of their actions.<p>> But equally, you could take the view that Google should have never entered the market relying on a tax loophole which was never supposed to be there in the first place that lawmakers were unaware of.<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa - reread and think that through. You want private citizens and organizations to guess what the laws are supposed to read like and act accordingly? You want them to guess what lawmakers were aware of in the laws they wrote? Wow.<p>> It was Google who changed any equilibrium by using the loophole.<p>What if they had no operations in Europe? They certainly don't need operations on the ground in Europe. So if they had no ops and no business presence, there's no basis for taxation. What next? Block them at the ISP level China-style unless they pay taxes? And so on.<p>> You can espouse the benefits of low taxation and the evils of legislators and bureaucracies and the laws of unintended consequences therein, but I don't see how game theory works in your favour in that argument.<p>I'm a huge devotee to the ""Never ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence"" school of thought. I don't think legislators and bureaucracies are evil, trying to drive business out of their countries and hurt people. No, I think they're well-meaning but clumsy.<p>As for game theory, it handles situations of competition and cooperation - it covers government/business interactions decently. John Forbes Nash actually won the Nobel Prize for economics by using these ideas in market economics. So I'm both not slinging mud at governments using game theory, yet noting that game theory is very applicable for slinging mud at governments if you so choose ;)<p>> I think taxation is a careful balance between maximising revenue and encouraging business and work, but this is increasingly difficult to balance with the existence of free trade agreements and the existence a global market. But whatever you think about tax policy, we should be able to agree that tax loopholes have no place in that equation, and that tax policy shouldn't be implemented via the backdoor with the benefits only available to large corporations with sufficiently clever accountants.<p>I <i>completely</i> disagree. I think it's <i>awesome</i> that governments are being forced to compete with each other for citizens and industry. I think a lot of old world government assumptions are going to fall apart when governments are forced to compete, and we're going to be left with a much better world. But now we're totally straying from game theory and getting into governance.<p>> N.B. England doesn't have a government - it's the UK Government.<p>Cheers for that - Clumsy American that I am, I slightly tweaked a few Englishmen by calling them ""British"" instead of ""English"" when I spent time in London, so I probably go a little too far in calling everything ""English"" now just to be on the safe side. For anyone that knows, what's the appropriate adjective for the UK government? British government? Or would you just say UK government every time?

They found that what was detrimental for women was detrimental for everybody, but women tended to be on the margin and so were more severely impacted.

Like the humble car, an engine-in-front design may protect the driver from nasty impacts, in this case blue-shifted gamma rays and microscopic particles that have been blue-shifted to the point that your ship is in a giant particle collider. If you could hide the crew in a sort of eclipsed position behind (in relation to the direction of momentum) the event horizon would act as a shield. This would mean you only had to harden equipment against radiation, rather than find a way to protect the crew themselves.<p>IMO though, if you've built a black hole, you might as well be moving something big, as in either a planet, small moon, or giant colony. On these scales the need to travel fast would become redundant, your colony ship could be so big it could literally house a world. Then an organisation like NASA would essentially become a planetary bus-driver association.",1259711708
971121,comment,970934,970934,0,0,jeremymims,,,"For the life of me, I can't understand why craigslist has had this mentality. I basically have to chalk it up to Craig being stubborn. He was burned by ebay grabbing 20%, he hasn't changed the design ever, and may constantly live in fear of being co-opted by the man. But like it or not, Craigslist is the man. And when your users go out of their way to create pieces of software that actually improve the experience for your users (like letting me sort through the pile of duplicate, spam, and misleading listings) don't shut them down. Open up and help them. Craigslist lets people post their information for free in many cases, but for some strange reason won't let people take information out.<p>I had hoped that the culture might become more developer friendly after Jeremy Zawodny (formerly at Yahoo) joined up.

Given that you could get a faculty advisor and independent committee to sign off on it, you could patch together your own degree from the courses offered in any of the colleges.  The idea was to encourage students to create an inter-disciplinary course.  They took care not let anyone who'd just changed majors 10 times to graduate with a BUS.<p>By combining courses from the Architecture, Film, and CS departments, I created a 'Digital Media' degree which doubled my salary in the graphic design department I was working in at the time.  (My responsibilities stayed exactly the same).  Since then no potential employer has asked about it, but it set the precedent for paying me more money.<p>Lessons learned: 1) You don't have to follow the same path as everyone else.  2) For plenty of places, the fact that you have the paper means more that what's printed on it.",1259709268

It hasn't hurt ATM usage, in general.  Likewise, PayPal fraud is still an issue that they fight every day...but PayPal is incredibly profitable.  eBay and craigslist also have huge fraud problems, but again, the sheer volume of legitimate transactions and the value of the huge markets they serve is enough to overcome any misgivings people have about using the services.

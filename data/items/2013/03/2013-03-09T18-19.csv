All the work is done openly and is open source, and that includes the spec, the Firefox optimizations and the emscripten support for asm.js.<p>> That's a ridiculous waste of resources, especially on battery-powered devices.<p>~2x slower than native is not optimal, sure.

My sense is that innovation prizes are mostly the whims of the wealthy - they are the modern equivalent of patronage. Performance-based patronage with a dash of magnanimity. Crowd-funded innovation prizes will probably not have an iconoclast to give the enterprise focus and visibility. That's not deadly, though: it's easy to imagine a crowd-funding site which solicits two things, money from ordinary people and endorsements from celebrities. You know, Paris Hilton's smiling face encouraging you to give $20 to the Singularity Prize.<p>And while I like the performance-based approach, unlike patronage this places a great deal of risk on the shoulders of the innovators. If they are independently wealthy, no problem. But most scientists aren't. Which means they'll need to get funded, which means dealing with capital. Now VCs are already, quite directly, in the research game. But even $10M prizes are small. Indeed, a $100M prize might be too small if there are many competitors and the challenge takes years. These prizes would have to be a lot bigger to compete with the kinds of payouts startups can yield.<p>Or perhaps the idea is that people compete while they are not doing anything at their day job at the Swiss patent office?",1362853235

The main symbol is a relocation in .data, not .text. Which is as you would expect given that declaration. You might be able to get around that by doing something like<p><pre><code>    unsigned char code[] = { 0xf0, 0x0f, 0xc7, 0xc8, 0xc3 };

    int main(void)
    {
        ((void (*)())code)();
        return 0;
    }

Some ISPs will let you tag your routes with BGP communities that say ``when advertising to AT&T, prepend some extra copies of some ASN so that AT&T will be unlikely to send me traffic via this path.''  <a href=""http://www.onesc.net/communities/as174/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onesc.net/communities/as174/</a> does not list any communities which would affect how Cogent advertises routes to AT&T without affecting how Cogent advertises to all of their other peers.  On the other hand, while 174:3001 is an extremely coarse tool, your traffic ratios may be sufficiently outbound only that sending most of your inbound traffic via Hurricane Electric might turn out OK, even with Hurricane Electric being only 1G and Cogent 10G (although this change might make your network less robust in the face of a DDOS attack, and you might want to drop 174:3001 when dealing with such an attack).<p>If the overloaded links are only overloaded in one direction, then you may only need to do one of these things, not both.",1362852472

2049302,comment,2048874,2049192,0,0,maguay,,,"My main goal is to profit while addressing a market I feel is under-served.  At the very least, I planned to shoot for a $9.99 or less price to get the higher royalty rate on Kindle (and to not looked overpriced versus other books in the same eBook marketplace).  I notice Rework is $9.02 on Kindle; does this pricing have anything to do with the Kindle Marketplace dynamics?<p>So, essentially, I'm planning on writing eBooks that I would sell as PDF/ePub on my own site or in a marketplace like TutsPlus, and also list the same eBooks in the Kindle and other eBook marketplaces.  I'm hoping to fill a need I see, as well as take advantage of the increasing popularity of eBooks and eReaders in general.  Just like the iOS store, there's a bit of market advantage to having a lower price since it gives your item more visibility.  My idea is to make books that are somewhat small (~150 pages or 10 short chapters), but a good value for the size.  Additionally, many self-published eBook writers are recommending taking the prices extremely low, to as little as $2.99 or so just to boost overall sales.<p>I know this isn't the approach 37signals usually takes, but with the above in mind, would you see an advantage to lower pricing or would you stick with a higher price?  Thanks again for your time and advice; I appreciate it more than you could ever know!  I'm thinking I ought to go ahead and get Rework about now...",1293641964

One response that the United States will eventually have to develop to this competitive environment in world trade is to build up the skill sets of young people growing up in the United States, for which school reform is still urgently needed, and to increase the entrepreneurial orientation of young people born and brought up in the United States. (I am trying to do my part, as the homeschooling parent of four children who have lived in the United States and overseas, to ensure that my children get sound primary and secondary educations and are entrepreneurial in their thinking.)<p>That said, another response that the United States never forgets to use in such challenges is being open to immigration and to foreign investment. If young people in another country stand out and succeed, they are always welcome to move to the United States and set up businesses here. And foreign entrepreneurs are always welcome to sell their products and services here and to set up branch offices or the main corporation headquarters here. The openness of the United States population to immigration and the openness of the United States economy to international trade allows Americans to gain most of the benefits of these trends, even if American-born persons aren't the chief drivers of these trends. The countries whose lunch is really being eaten are those like North Korea, closed both to immigration and to trade, and oppressed by dictatorial governments.",1293641932

The power of ""anonymous functions"" is <i>not</i> in failing to give them a name, it is in your ability to just create one in the flow of another function and have all the mighty power of closures. The anonymity is, in the grand scale of things, quite incidental.<p>I wouldn't say this except for how people go ballistic if their ""anonymous functions"" aren't supported in a language that has everything else you need. That's silly. You don't need the YCombinator in Perl 5 or Perl 6 because ""my $func; $func = sub { $func->(...) }"" is perfectly fine.<p>In other news, the importance of ""asynchronous"" is that it doesn't block, <i>not</i> that you've manually chopped it up into a lengthy stream of event handlers. If it doesn't block, it doesn't block, even if the code on first impression looks like blocking code but in fact the runtime takes care of the continuation transform for you. (Also I can rant about how the word ""immutable"" gets misinterpreted and cargo-culted but that would be a lengthier post.)",1293641342

Now construct a random spanning tree for the graph, and remove the walls corresponding to edges of the spanning tree. Finally, choose two leaves of the tree (for bonus points, two leaves that are maximally far apart; for even more bonus points, interpret ""far apart"" in a way that tries to maximize the difficulty of finding the path between them) and label them ""start"" and ""end"".<p>How do you construct a random spanning tree? One way is to use Kruskal's algorithm with random weights on the edges.

Our goal is to gather as many users as possible during this time of the year (whether we make a profit on them or not) so the app can spread more easily organically after this period is over.<p>Let us know what you think of our move!",1293639119

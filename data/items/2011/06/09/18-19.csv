2638349,comment,2637691,2637691,4,0,RomP,,,"This is an abomination.  This patent clearly fails the obviousness test (that is, if somebody is capable of reading the patent all the way through without being disgusted and embarrassed for the ""inventors"").  Unfortunately, most of the software patents are like this: the Patent Office is clearly failing us.  Math formulas are not patentable, and software is just that: math.<p>Seems like our only hope is if somebody powerful and famous, with a big software patent portfolio, can sacrifice it for the good of the industry and advocate for banning software patents.  Steve Jobs and his position against DRM in music comes to mind as a similar move.  Wouldn't it be great if leaders of the industry get together and petition/lobby for this change?  One can only dream...",1307645997

(Some would see this as cultural complicitness with client/server as technosocial class division, but the effect is similar regardless of how it's spun.)  A related technical problem is the use of carrier NAT, which gets very tricky to traverse.<p>So actually getting devices to call home to the personal cloud seems like it would be harder to make happen, and more importantly, harder to make reliable, because you can't use economic power to force at least one side to act in a convenient manner.

This whole thing was a ridiculous culture shock to me.  I quit because I wanted to try something different -- it was different, all right.<p>For the first year or so I was doing some development work on the client side as well as requirements gathering and dealing with integration.  I was cool with this, because  I was doing something technical but wanted something that would flex my people skills as well.<p>At one point I was tasked with requirements gathering for a customer who wanted some custom work done to their installation of our product.  They bought two weeks of my time to draft a spec, and no development -- my deliverable was basically to draft the SOW for the next consultant who was to write a technical design for someone else who was to write code.<p>I finished the spec, in spite of a client who really was extremely hard to deal with. The client sat on it for a few months and decided they wanted to revisit the issue, so I got on a plane again and spent two more weeks trying to tease some answers out of them so I could revise things.<p>The final specification amounted to approximately 95 pages including screenshot mockups.  The spec went back to the home office, where our development team reviewed it and quoted something like three or four months' time to develop it, test it, and hand off back to the customer for acceptance testing.  They planned for the invariable back and forth on that as well.  This was in February of that particular year; they were looking at taking the feature live on January 1 of the following year.<p>The feature they requested?  Four simple web forms, the code to validate their input, and a report generator to dump back out what was put into the form.<p>After we finalized the spec for this I turned in my two weeks and went straight back to academia, where four web forms and a report is something you write, wrap automated tests around, and deploy  before lunchtime.",1307645493

For the small fraction of use-cases that still need proprietary software there's virtualization.<p>They're not going after the home sector here (they have Android phones and tablets handling that for them nicely). They're going for the throat with Microsoft's last dominance: schools and businesses. If they can start upsetting the decades-long lock-in that Microsoft has had in those giant areas, then Chromebooks have succeeded.<p>(And before you ask, no the iPad isn't a suitable product for those areas.

You have some data represented in XML, and it shows up in a Word doc presented in a certain way.

The tech community really does not have the size and influence to be able to force even a fifth of the companies to withdraw their support of SOPA.<p>The overwhelming majority of the effort should be going to calling/sending (physical) letters to one's respective representatives, maybe setting up some sort of a fund to oppose SOPA/PIPA, urging tech companies like Google to spend more on lobbying (They can and should be spending more to lobby against the act), etc.<p>Edit: I was under the incorrect impression that OPEN act would end nonsense like SOPA/PIPA.

Here it is again:<p><i>I understand that many will say ""but there's no way you're going to make any kind of useful layer of abstraction in 10K of code!"" I disagree, but that a big can of worms to open up in a HN thread.</i><p>Wow, do people really think 10k LOC not enough to build up useful abstraction layers? Tell that to Alan Kay, who is working with the Viewpoints Research Institute working on building a full system (from the OS kernel to GUI apps like document editors) in 20k LOC. While they're not there yet, they have a 200 LOC TCP/IP implementation, 800 LOC graphics system, comparable to Cairo (which is 20k LOC of C if I remember correctly), and many other achievements. [1]
They're able to do this partly due to their language-oriented designs: they create specialized languages for each system. Note that the compilers for these languages are included in the LOC-counts given above. These are not general-purpose languages, but DSLs, and they are written in a language that is specialized for writing languages, naturally.

3389562,comment,3388893,3388893,31,0,raganwald,,,"The notion of programming languages being too powerful rests on fallacious assumptions.<p>The faulty reasoning is this: If Hacker Hortense does something with powerful language L that Newbie Nathan finds confusing, we assume that language J wont permit Hortense to do that, and therefore if we standardize on language J, fewer bad things will happen.<p>This reasoning is faulty. First off, if Hortense and Nathan dont see eye to eye on how to write programs, no language will solve the problem, because you have a disparity of experience and/or education. If what you want is code Nathan will like, and you dont want to raise Nathan to Hortenses level, you have to drag Hortense down to Nathans level with coding standards. And you could have done that in Language L just as easily as J. If you ban L, what will you do when Hortense implements Parser Combinators and Monads in J?<p>The first flaw is the assumption that language <i>features</i> introduce complexity, when in reality it isnt the features, its the <i>solution to the problem</i> that confuses.<p>This indirectly leads into the second fault with the reasoning. There is a hidden assumption that Hortense is going to write so much code, and there will be so many problems Nathan will have with his code, and every problem we eliminate is one fewer problem in the result. This is not how software works.<p>Lets say Hortense writes some code in L, and Nathan complains that there are seventeen things he doesnt understand. Ten of them rely on features of L, seven are independent of the language. If we tell Hortense to rewrite things in J, we cannot assume that the result will have seven things Nathan doesnt understand. It might have even more as Hortsense works around Js deficiencies.<p>For a demonstration of this, look at any modern Java Dependency Injection Framework. These complex and opaque software machines are made up of of XML, interfaces, and classes. They exist in no little part because Java lacks the reflection and meta-programming of languages like Lisp or even Ruby. Are these thing simple by virtue of being written in Java instead of Lisp?<p>Imagine for a moment that DI frameworks dont exist, and that Hortense had built something in Lisp with macros for dependency injection. Nathan is nonplussed, so Hortense rewrites it in Java and rolls her own DI infrastructure. Will the result really have fewer things that Nathan doesnt understand? Or will it be even more inscrutable thanks to the accidental complexity of working around Java's limits??<p>The problem is not that some languages are too powerful, it is that people imagine that teams of programmers can work together on complex problems without communicating, and some people assume that when there is a disparity of experience of knowledge, that people can work together without educating or learning from each other.",1324757317

The root cause of SOPA is a culture of piracy and a lack of participation by leaders in technology to develop better enforcement regulations.<p>Laws like SOPA are going to continue to be proposed until a better solution to copyright protection is enacted.  If we leave those proposals to be constructed by media companies who don't care as much about the integrity of the internet as they do about their bottom line, you'll just keep getting new laws that overreach and threaten our freedoms.  The fact that we're facing SOPA is bad, but it's the direct result of too many people pretending that copyright protection isn't an important issue that deserves better solutions, both by arguing against the rights of creators, and failing to proactively help create a better system of enforcement.<p>If you really want to do something powerful to stop SOPA-like legislation in its various forms, your essay should also aim to remind people that we're facing this legislation because people engage in piracy, and that we need leaders in the tech community to be more proactive about improving the DMCA if they want to have a voice in what shape copyright protection takes.  It might seem like SOPA is ""the problem"" but it's really one party's proposed solution to a very real issue.  An argument for why SOPA is bad without proposals about how to meet the needs of the party for whom SOPA is a solution only sends those people back to their misguided drawing board.<p>I respect the stand you've taken against SOPA.

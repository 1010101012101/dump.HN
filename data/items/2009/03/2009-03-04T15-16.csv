There's enough of a Ruby community that they can serve that niche and do it well.<p>There's nothing so exceptional about what they're doing that it couldn't be done in Python with what is available (the exceptional part is that they execute well and are highly reliable).  Basically, the benefit of Heroku is that they can keep extra hardware on hand for spikes and there's a decent assumption that, say, your site spikes to 300% of normal once a week, but that not all sites will be spiking at the same time.  Therefore, you get more efficient utilization of resources.<p>But you could do this yourself - it would just mean that you would need to buy all the capacity to handle spikes while Heroku works off the assumption that part of that spike capacity can be shared since not all sites will spike at once.",1236182134

502997,comment,502709,502926,0,0,garply,,,"When I dug into this when I was setting up, my understanding was that, in Delaware, there is established case law dealing with multiple shareholders that investors really like. But in Nevada, privacy laws are supposedly stronger (I believe they don't share corporate info with the IRS) and it is advertised that Nevada courts are less likely to pierce the corporate veil. A recent googling just turned up this counter-argument to that (<a href=""http://www.youngentrepreneur.com/forum/f2-general-business/delaware-vs-nevada-28415.html#post164025"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youngentrepreneur.com/forum/f2-general-business/d...</a>) so YMMV.<p>I believe the costs are pretty comparable if you're an out-of-stater: You'll get hit with annual registration fees (slightly higher in Nevada, I believe) and the need for a registered agent in either location, but you'll get hit with a franchise tax in Delaware (not sure if it offsets the Nevada registration fee off the top of my head). Either way, if you're not operating in Nevada or Delaware, the  state in which your business is operating is going to want taxes, so it doesn't really help in that regard. (And, as an aside, if you're in California, taxes really suck).",1236181602

Maybe the listener, having heard the music, determines it's not of any monetary value.  Are they obligated to pay anyway?  No, and the street musician knows this.  They understand that only a certain percentage of people that stop to listen will actually pay anything.  It's true, too, that maybe someone will listen to the music and be unable to pay.  Should they block their ears as they walk past because they cannot give what the musician would like to receive for his service?  In the case of a screen reader, maybe the user doesn't even know the ads exist.<p>If the street musician decides his business model isn't supporting him as much as he'd like, maybe he'll stop playing music.  And will the public that decided to not pay him anything really care that he doesn't play it anymore?  No.  They decided it wasn't valuable enough to pay for.<p>If you feel your content is worth something or you need money to continue providing it, you should charge people for it outright, or make an explicit request for donations.  If people find value in your content and are able to, they will pay for it.<p>It should not be expected that when you put content freely available somewhere, whether it be publishing a blog or playing music in the street that everyone who reads or hears it finds it of equal value or is willing and able to pay for it.

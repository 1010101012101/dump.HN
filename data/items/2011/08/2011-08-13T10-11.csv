2880730,comment,2877563,2880472,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"""Properly done CS _is_ maths.""<p>Okay, then you would agree with my thought on this thread that the math departments should just take over CS!  The CS would get some much better math, and the math departments would get a big head and tummy ache from the much needed contact with applications.  Fine with me.<p>""is disingenuous at best.""<p>No.  That chemistry uses some group theory for molecular spectroscopy and makes a mess out of it, which it has been known to do, doesn't mean that a mathematician who sits in a chair with plastic fake leather shouldn't comment.  So, yes, IP routing has been based on some network shortest path algorithms.  So, they used some operations research material since really it was operations research that first dug into networks that deeply -- yes, I know, there was a Nobel prize in economics for some work by Kantorovich (?) in the late 1940s on the transportation problem and, earlier, work in circuit theory as in Kirchhoff.  Still, e.g., with Ford and Fulkerson and then Jack Edmonds, network shortest path and flows on networks should be attributed to operations research.  If IP routing got to use it, then fine.  Once I used Cunningham's version of the network simplex algorithm on a problem in allocating sales forces in a tricky situation:  The problem looked like just integer linear programming, but if looked again it was just network flows where can get integer solutions for no extra effort.  That doesn't mean that network flows should be part of courses in selling!<p>But CS is not just using network flows but calling the subject part of computer science.  That's hijacking!  Or it justifies my ""Not really good."".<p>But, such things will happen.  There is no law that says that have to be an operations research person to publish in an operations research journal or to publish about networks in a computer science journal.  The NSF even works to encourage 'cross-cutting'.<p>Since my writing is so 'succinct', maybe I wasn't clear!  If CS wants to take a field like network flows for their own, then actually do a competent job of it and don't mess it up.  So, when there's is need, as there is, for the simplex algorithm, and not just using it but calling it part of CS, then do a competent job with the simplex algorithm.  If probabilistic analysis of the performance of algorithms is to be part of CS, then CS should do a competent job with the probability.  Else, CS is diluting the quality of these subjects.  I argued elsewhere on HN that CS has diluted the meaning of dynamic programming, also essentially hijacked by CS.<p>If you want to say that CS done well is math, then they should do the math well.<p>When I was in grad school, I took some courses in measure theory and functional analysis from a department not the pure math department.  And I took some statistics.  When the statistics got to sufficient statistics, which is from the Radon-Nikodym theorem of measure theory, the prof totally blew it.  I just walked out of the class; mostly I knew the material at the elementary level anyway, and at the level I wanted to learn the material the course was a waste of my time.  Well, in the courses in measure theory and functional analysis, the profs maintained quality only slightly short of Bourbaki.  They didn't have less than a beautifully polished proof for anything.  Any hint or suggestion that there was a logical gap was a very big deal in the department.  When I walked out of the stat course, the department dumped on me.  Then I dumped back on the mess made of the R-N theorem.  The next year the stat prof was gone.  That department, not pure math, took the math fully seriously:  A prof who blew a good proof of one important theorem was looking for a job.  The situation was SERIOUS.  We weren't a pure math department, but we did the math in rock solid ways.  The department also had some operations research:  Similarly.  The math was rock solid.  E.g., at one point in the Kuhn-Tucker conditions, I objected that a proof had used but not assumed continuous differentiability.  I worked up a proof with just differentiability, and my proof was in the course the next semester.<p>So, broadly, just because we were interested in some math topics not common in pure math departments, and interested in applications, didn't mean we did the math at a lower level of quality.  We were as close to Bourbaki as anyone.  It can be done.  CS should do it, too.  Sorry 'bout that.  Low quality is not good; I called out some low quality.  I was fully correct to do so.  The problem is not my arrogance but their low quality.<p>""In a general sense, yes, it would be good. Maybe you also need to read some better CS stuff?""<p>So, we are in agreement, ""it would be good"".<p>For my reading, that's about me, and that's not appropriate.  The issue is the book CLRS or whatever it is called.  I'm not the issue.<p>But for some ""better CS stuff"", you mentioned von Neumann.  Right:  In my favorite source of the R-N theorem, the proof is by von Neumann.  In my current project, there's some math at the core, some original, and some due to von Neumann.  I credit him and Kolmogorov.<p>For the paper I sent, I sent it to an appropriate journal.  The motivation for the research was a problem in computer science.  The main application for the original part of the research was just to that problem.  That there was some original math at the core of the paper was part of the work as in your remark that CS should be math.<p>You are agreeing with my main point that CS should clean up its math and then calling me arrogant for making this point.  Can't have it both ways.<p>For the course of study I outlined, what important about CS does that omit!  I know; I know; it omits heap sort!  And AVL trees.  Gee, looks like that course of study needs more, maybe a lecture, maybe even two, of an hour each?<p>Do the math.  For the CS, do that in the exercises and footnotes!",1313231818

4620676,comment,4620373,4620373,1,0,fruchtose,,,"I think the pricing scheme is way too clumsy. The Amon and Amon Plus seem to map to two different kinds of web apps: hobby, and mission critical. There's a huge gap between the two plans. You're basically ignoring the users between the two levels by insisting that anyone who needs more than basic service get the super deluxe model.<p>The pricing scheme drastically needs a change. The free level is fine, but there needs to be at least onepaid intermediate levels: 2 apps, with features between free and plus. Why? If a developer is doing 1 hobby web app and wants to take it to the next level, a 2-app plan will both provide support for their current app and allow breathing room in case they want to go for a second.<p>As a web app developer myself, I would not pay for the Amon Plus plan. I have 1 web app running on AppFog. I don't need to pay for unlimited servers and unlimited apps. I would pay for basic support, but paid basic support is not available in the two tiers offered.",1349535497

It just doesn't feel sexy/special to me as there is one iPhone millions lust for and the press and consumers go ape nuts over.<p>-  The carriers and device manufacturers have a stranglehold on Android.  Many Android users are not able to update their 2010 or 2011 Android device to 2012/2013 software as you can choose to do so with the iPhone.  Also the device manufacturers create they own UI and add bells whistles.  Android does not have one UI/UX to rule them all like iPhone.<p>With that being said as a long time iPhone owner .. I am annoyed by....<p>- Apple's tight control on it's ecosystem .. it indeed stifles innovation. I wish they would allow developers to build onto the built in apps (plug ins) like the camera, maps, alarm clock, facetime and other built in apps.<p>- New Maps definitely a step down from Google Maps<p>Overall I just wish there was only one Android device in which the UI/UX is controlled by Google.

And it's possible that software engineering never existed either. We program. We do it because we like it and it pays.

There isn't a single device for Sprint or Verizon (accounting for over half the market) that CyanogenMod supports.  With AT&T, you're limited to the Galaxy S II Skyrocket (and, really, you'd want the S III).  There's also not a device released in 2012 that CyanogenMod supports.  CyanogenMod gave me a workable system at a time when Samsung abandoned my device having never fixed major bugs.  However, with newer devices, CyanogenMod seems to be slipping behind.  If you're buying a nice Android device today and putting out $200, you're getting something like a Galaxy S III, a One X, or a RAZR M and it isn't clear that you'll be getting much support for your device (from the manufacturer, carrier, Google, or third parties).<p>I bought into Android with high hopes.  I understand how crappy Apple's closed model is.  However, Android is making you beholden to the device manufacturer and your carrier in the same way iPhone users are beholden to Apple - unless you can reverse engineer device drivers.  I know, in theory, you could hire someone or whatnot, but in practice Apple supports their devices for many years while Android phones may never see updates.  Buying an Android phone has to be a purchase where you assume you won't even get an OS that exists today unless it's pre-loaded on the phone.  Android manufacturers bought themselves a year of ""but it's going to change"" when they made the pledge.  That pledge fell through as soon as it came time to actually provide the upgrades.<p>Saying that they aren't stuck is somewhat akin to saying that poor people could just go out and become rich.  Sure, in theory, there are always opportunities and whatnot, but it just isn't that easy.  In reality, Google didn't free us, but tethered us to manufacturers that care less and carriers that are even worse.  If Google were to be credited here, I think they should have insisted on a model where device manufacturers release drivers (ala Windows) so that users could install Android from any source.  Even better would be to have those drivers be open source so that users could update them (providing updates is going to be easier than reverse engineering).  That would have led to real options.",1349532767

Attempting to teach programming to 20-year-olds entering an university seems to not work terribly well, while the basics can be picked by a 10-year old.<p>If you waited until people are 20 to start teaching them to read and write, you would probably also get poor results, while the weird kids who learned to read for fun when they were 12 would end up outperforming the regular students when they grew up.",1349532511

I'm a grad school dropout, so my bet is that my CS education is above average for a working programmer. A hiring process considered ""demanding"" (such as Google's) is basically testing if you know the stuff they learn in the first year and a half of an undergraduate program. Contrast that to the amount of training and test-taking that a doctor must go through and it'll put what I said in proper context.",1349532435

4620544,comment,4620220,4620410,9,0,woadwarrior01,,,"Are you sure? This was my reasoning when I bought a Nexus S in early 2011 just after it was released. It came with Gingerbread. Later, at the end of the year, they released the ICS update, and then subsequently was blocked. One of my friends got it, but I never got it (until I  downloaded the ROM from somewhere and manually updated). The official line was that this was due to poor battery backup, but I felt the battery backup time improved after the update. Eventually I ended up selling it for 100$ and buying a iPhone 4s.<p>Clearly, all hardware manufacturers have an incentive to not give updates in order to compel people to buy their latest devices. It's just that Apple plays a slightly different game by giving updates, which make your device slower and slower with every upgrade until about 18-24 months later, you just fork out cash to buy their latest device.",1349532312

Does it matter if he was initially passionate, or only after making the money?<p>A friend of mine hated piano as a child, only after many forced hours of practice (from his tiger mom) he became really good and started to win state championships for his ability.  After a few more years, he developed a passion for it and played piano for fun.  He never liked piano to begin with, but when he became good at it, he developed that passion.<p>So I'd argue that a bad programmer, after making some decent money, can become passionate at it when the initial driver started as money.",1349532292

To some extent it did have an impact, as some creditor nations stated publicly that our policies were affecting their decisions about buying future American debt.  One of the ratings agencies also dropped our rating slightly (though that was a partisan farce).<p>I think a lot of the impact was reduced by the fact that the money supply is already very large, and also by the fact that much of the new money didn't really enter the public currency supply. e.g. Buying a block of bad mortgages from a bank probably doesn't affect much. The bank was already treating this as a real asset, borrowing against it, etc.",1349532225

The telcos we buy phones from are and they want more models they can push. Also, there are certification issues on different markets. For instance, it's illegal to use an iPhone 5 in Brazil because it wasn't approved by the regulatory agency.<p>One way Motorola can get around this would be to make the phones more modular, with models differing in peripheral components (keypads, LCDs, cameras), keeping the computing engine consistent and manage building images with component-specific flags.<p>One way Google could step in to help would be to make less updates to Android core and release more frequent updates of their userland apps (GMail, Maps, Plus etc). I get JB has better rendering performance on current hardware, but I can live without a performance enhancement for a phone I already have if, in return, I get something like Google Now.<p>And finally, telcos can somehow mitigate the problem by making the phone purchase experience better. If the experience of upgrading a phone were enjoyable, people would do it more often, keep themselves locked in their contracts and just be happy about it.",1349532137

Marshall Brane&#x27;s <i>Manna</i> did something similar, even if  you don&#x27;t consider it fine literature. Charles Bukowski for poetry, which for some reason I can relate to, despite not sharing any experiences with the author ... which kind of worries me.<p>Various practical books such as <i>Secrets of Power Negotiation</i> by Roger Dawson if that sort of thing will help you.",1379203159

6387595,comment,6387044,6387044,1,0,Mazz,,,"Just read it... Here is what I came up with.\nI start work at 9:00 am, before work I always go to my favorite coffee bar called &quot;Muazam&#x27;s Coffee&quot; it&#x27;s 10 minutes walk from my workplace. So I arrive there 8:30 am to have a morning mocha with breakfast while reading the newspaper. One day a man approached me right before the coffee bars entrance and asked me if he could experiment a problem on me, he promised I would get enough cash for a coffee.<p>Well, why not I thought. He presented me Two Envelopes and said &quot;One contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep the money it contains. You pick at random, but before you open the envelope, you are offered the chance to take the other envelope instead.&quot;<p>Without giving it a single thought, I picked the one on left for me, and began to unfold it. He looked at me and said &quot;don&#x27;t you want to swap?!&quot;, I had just unfolded the envelope and pulled out $20 bucks, &quot;too late for that I guess&quot; I said. I could tell by the look of his face that he was disappointed, he unfolded the other envelope and pulled out $10 bucks. He left me without saying a word.<p>I went to the coffee bar and spent the money I&#x27;ve just gotten. I took my coffee and breakfast and sat down on one of the outside tables. I saw the Envelop man again, this time he had found another guy. He had two new envelopes and asked the guy the same question. But this guy took out a pen and paper and started doing some math. It was already 8:47, I had to go to work.<p>Next day, same routine. I go to the Muazam&#x27;s Coffee bar, and I see Envelope and mathematician guy(let&#x27;s call him Joe) sitting on one of the tables outside the bar. The guy is still trying to solve the problem. I was kinda impressed how much Joe had put effort into this, he already had four A4 full of notes that seemed like formulas.<p>This went for weeks, months, years.<p>Everyday, before work I would see them outside. The Envelope man having two envelopes by his side and Joe trying to solve the problem.<p>28 years had passed...<p>I was going to Muazam&#x27;s Coffee bar as usual when I noticed there was ambulance outside. I went to see who they came for, for my surprise it was Joe. I asked the envelope man, what had happened, he told me Joe had a heart attack.<p>Joe was admitted in a hospital, he was in bad condition.\nThe envelope man visited him and said &quot;Joe, I am proud of you. We have spent so much time together and you still don&#x27;t have the perfect formula to solve this problem. Maybe this problem can&#x27;t be solved with math..&quot;.<p>Joe looked him in the eye and said &quot;No, I won&#x27;t give up. I will get this right and get the highest amount of cash&quot;. The envelope man said &quot;You can have them both&quot; and he unfolded both of the envelopes. One containing $1 and the other one $2. This is where Joe had another heart attack.",1379203055

6387585,comment,6385600,6387004,1,0,lutusp,,,"> the link you provide in &quot;support&quot; actually said we CAN feed our present numbers<p>The hungry aren&#x27;t fed by unrealized possibilities. All the numbers do is fluctuate, they don&#x27;t ever indicate that we&#x27;re feeding the hungry. It&#x27;s not at all surprising that the numbers fluctuate, we&#x27;re talking about reality, not a computer model. But one thing doesn&#x27;t change -- the shocking number of people who are starving at any given time.<p>When it comes to hunger, there&#x27;s no point in arguing that that we <i>can</i> feed the hungry, as you put it. There&#x27;s only whether we did -- everything else is hand-waving.<p>> In short, your link does not in any way support your argument.<p>Of course it does. The number of people who are starving is very high. Some years it&#x27;s higher, some years lower, but it&#x27;s never &quot;acceptable&quot; and it always supports the claim I made about it -- we aren&#x27;t feeding the hungry.<p>The presence of unused stockpiles of food means nothing -- there are any number of reasons why that situation exists, but the bottom line is that the hungry aren&#x27;t fed. Do you really think some conscientious aid worker goes home after a hard day&#x27;s work, satisfied that he had fed the hungry <i>in principle</i>?<p>> Here&#x27;s a useful tip: most people are not complete idiots.<p>Think like a scientist. Use the null hypothesis as your guide. Let yourself be pleasantly surprised by what people know, but never assume that people know what they need to know to have any given conversation or deal with any given problem. The consequences of that mistake vary between foolish and dangerous.<p>> <a href=""http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html</a><p>Yes, very familiar with this article -- I use it in my anti-psychology campaign.

It is detailing the manner in which the USG is experiencing some brain drain due to both its policies and image. I wish the author had contextualized the Miami conference a bit better (and the Fedora comment is hardly forgivable, I hear Windows 8 is used in China too). There really is a need for some US cyber policy but I fear that in its current incarnation that the government is not well suited to bring on the kind of infosec talent that it needs. Yes there may have been excesses (I think I saw one or two Snowden articles on HN) but there are real attacks going on against both USG networks and those of prominent US companies. With all the people on here who are US based entrepreneurs (aspiring or succeeding) I think we want some level of government protection against foreign government attacks, in the same manner as brick and mortar businesses don&#x27;t want tanks rolling through their walls.<p>I just hope that the US as a country consisting of both public and private sector can reach a point where petty (rather outdated) regs don&#x27;t prevent willing top talent from helping the government while simultaneously ensuring that US tech companies don&#x27;t fall into being simple fronts for USG collection.",1379202792

You can see this in the US cellphone industry - by increasing the complexity of their plans, cellphone providers have made it more expensive to comparison shop, meaning that customers (rationally) go with the first option rather than the lowest-cost one.<p>You can also see this with some of the smaller-scale Ponzis and investment scams - so long as the amount of money each investor has invested is much smaller than the amount it&#x27;d cost to investigate the investment, it&#x27;s not rational for them to do so.

6387568,comment,6387044,6387044,1,0,scythe,,,"This is a fantastic and subtle paradox, and not at all taken to quick resolution. A resolution follows, first to spot a problem (if there is one) gets a cookie.<p>Consider the amount in the lower to be f(x), the higher to be x, given f(z) such that f(z) < z for all z. In this way we generalize to <i>all</i> distributions, as the problem clearly applies to <i>all</i> distributions. You open the first envelope, which contains A. The second envelope contains B. The challenge is to calculate the value of B.<p>First we must calculate x. The chance that A = f(x) is 1/2, the chance that A = x is 1/2. The average value of A is (x + f(x))/2, so the average value of x is [f+I]^{-1}(2A), where I is the identity function and [g]^{-1} denotes an inverse function.<p>Now we calculate B. The trick lies in this: <i>both calculations must lie in the same reference frame</i>. So B = x with probability 1/2, and B = f(x) with probability 1/2, giving us B = (x + f(x))/2.<p>The rest is plug-and-chug: B = ([f+I]^{-1}(2A) + f([f+I]^{-1}(2A))/2 --> B = [f+I]([f+I]^{-1}(2A))/2 --> B = 2A/2 thus B = A.<p>Therefore over all probability distributions that can be defined we have the average value of B equal to A in any case. A purely mathematical resolution is satisfying, but I am not in any case an epistemologist, so it may not satisfy people who take a different interpretation of math than me. It works, and I like it.",1379202524

One envelope has amount z, but the agent doesn&#x27;t know if z = x or z = 2x.<p>If it is true that not switching leads to an EV of 3x/2 but switching leads to a higher EV: then a single switch each round should come back with an average value of greater than 3x/2.<p>In the Montey Hall problem, we can code up such an agent to demonstrate that the naive intuition is wrong.

Lightening got the DTV box&#x27;s phone circuitry (the rest of box worked fine) when we weren&#x27;t home, and I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new one. A buddy showed me how to hack the card with a reader/writer, and I was into the scene for a while (I continued to pay DTV their money each month; this was a hardware fix, not payment avoidance). It was fun working on something at such a low level. Far smarter folks than me were doing the actual hacks, but I had a grasp of what was going on. Very simplistically, the card acted like the cable TV filters on the side of your house, deciding what the box would and would not decode for your viewing pleasure.<p>By the time Black Sunday rolled around, I had purchased a new box and gone &quot;legit&quot;. But I did read about it, and was impressed by a very cleverly put together and well-timed hack to make all of those cards go <i>poof</i>. What TFA doesn&#x27;t mention, and maybe I&#x27;m remembering it wrong, was that it was the hacks themselves that did the cards in.

6387528,comment,6387044,6387455,1,0,jamii,,,"I guess I skipped a lot of background knowledge :)<p>The quantity everyone is arguing about is &#x27;the expected gain from swapping envelopes&#x27; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value</a>). Informally, you might say &#x27;the average gain from swapping envelopes&#x27;. The way you work this out is you take all the possible things that could happen and for each one multiply the probability of it happening by the amount you gain if it happens. For example, suppose we play a game where I toss a coin. If it&#x27;s heads I give you $2 and if it&#x27;s tails you give me $1. Your expected gain from playing this game is:<p><pre><code>    E(Gain) = P(Heads)*Gain(Heads) + P(Tails)*Gain(Tails)\n            = 1/2 * $2 + 1/2 * -$1\n            = $1 - $0.5\n            = $0.5\n</code></pre>\nIf you play the game repeatedly, your average gain will converge to the expected gain ie if you played the game a million times you would win pretty close t half a million dollars. That&#x27;s called the law of large numbers (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers</a>).  That&#x27;s why we care about expectation - it tells us what would happen on average over large numbers of repeated trials. It&#x27;s also very simple to calculate and quite intuitive to reason about.<p>In the case of the two envelopes the problem comes from the fact that there are an infinite number of possible amounts in the envelope. It turns out that adding up an infinite series of numbers doesn&#x27;t always behave the way you would expect eg<p><pre><code>     1 + (-1  +  1) + (-1  +  1) ... = 1 + 0 + 0 ... = 1\n    (1 +  -1) + (1  +  -1) + (1 ...  = 0 + 0 + 0 ... = 0\n</code></pre>\nIn the example above we are adding up the same numbers in both cases, but depending on how we group them we get different answers. The same thing is happening in the envelope problem. The different arguments in this thread are just different ways of adding up all the possible cases and they get different results. The actual problem here is that the theory of expectation only applies when the sum is well behaved (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence</a>).<p>Because the expectation is not well-defined for the envelope problem the law of large numbers does not apply either. If you play the game millions and millions of times your average win per game will not settle down but will keep jumping around forever.<p>Like the Monty Hall problem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem</a>), it&#x27;s interesting because even expert mathematicians often get the wrong answer if they don&#x27;t carefully work it out step by step.

The paradox assumes that when we see the value of money in the envelope we open, we get no information about whether that&#x27;s the smaller or larger amount of money. Now, in practice, is that possible?<p>Let X,Y be i.i.d. draws from some distribution with CDF F, and say we see Y=y when we open our envelope. If the distribution satisfies the constraints of the problem, then we have to have that, for all possible values of y:\nP(X > Y | Y = y) = 1/2 = P(X < Y | Y = y)<p>In practice, this is impossible. The reason why this is impossible is because P(X>Y | Y = y) = (1-F(y)). Since F(y) is a CDF, if we take the limit as y goes to infinity we have that (1-F(y)) = 1. So (1-F(y)) can&#x27;t equal 1/2 regardless of y. That is, the probability that the other envelope contains the larger or smaller value is not independent of the value we observe in the envelope we open. And, more importantly, it can&#x27;t be, such a distribution doesn&#x27;t exist. You have to consider the sampling distribution to get a meaningful calculation.",1379201672

Remember that nature efficiently picks out those with the highest birthrates and makes them the entire future population. My point is that population growth is naturally unstable, depending only on food sources and a willingness to push other species out of the way.<p>1.1% per annum may not seem like a very large rate of increase, but 63 years doesn&#x27;t seem like a very long time to double the world&#x27;s population either.<p>Exponential increases of all kinds are rather scary to model.

I.e. strategy A is superior to strategy B if it yields higher returns after, say, 1,000,000 iterations.<p>So there are two envelopes, X and 2X. You select one, then you&#x27;re offered a chance to change your selection.

You&#x27;re forced to choose one of these possibilities randomly, because you have no information to guide your choice. Since two of them yield 2X and two yield X, and since your choice is necessarily random, then therefore all strategies will converge on the same expected value. In short, it doesn&#x27;t matter what you do. You always have a 50% chance of X or 2X, regardless of your sequence of choices.<p>At first glance this is similar to the Monty hall problem, but the critical difference is that information is revealed during the Monty hall problem.

6387408,comment,6387044,6387044,5,0,millstone,,,"This is one of my favorite problems. Here is one variation can help clarify thinking about it:<p>&quot;There&#x27;s two envelopes. One contains twice as much money as the other. No envelope contains more than $N.&quot;<p>This changes the problem dramatically. If your envelope contains more than $N/2, of course you should not switch: the other envelope necessarily contains less. If it contains $N/2 or less, perhaps you should switch: the other envelope may or may not contain more.<p>Say your envelope contains $x, and you don&#x27;t know what $N is. There&#x27;s two possibilities:<p>1. $x <= $N/2. If you switch, your expectation value is $3x/2, by the original argument.<p>2. $x > $N/2. If you switch, you will get $x/2, since no envelope contains more than $N.<p>If we assume the distribution is uniform on the range [0, N], then these possibilities are equally likely. Therefore the total expectation value is the average of the EVs of the two possibilities (3x/2 and x/2), which is $x. So we recovered the naive expectation of &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; from this variation. Now we can take the limit as $N goes to infinity, and while the EV of $x approaches infinity, the fact that switching does not matter does not change.<p>As others have said, the underlying problem is the assumption that a uniform probability on an infinite set makes sense, which it does not. However, we can instead take the limit for finite sets, in which case we recover the intuitive result that switching does not matter.",1379199787

DARPA gives overhead in all sorts of ranges.  Or so I hear.<p>And TSRI doesn&#x27;t give most of its professors salary, unless they are doing &quot;administrative duties&quot; (Pres, VP, dept chair, etc) If you run out of grants, you basically don&#x27;t get paid anymore.  At one point ~90% of TSRI operating costs were run off of NIH overhead, all coming in from a very dynamic patchwork of grants from all of their PIs.  I think then the pressure to keep getting grants made the place a bit of a boiler room, there was an uptick in shady science (Peter Schultz&#x27;s retractions, Geoffrey Chang&#x27;s retractions, and others I&#x27;m not ready to talk about yet)...

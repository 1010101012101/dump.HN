7924312,comment,7922266,7924131,2,0,tempestn,,,"> > To use the example from the article, any design must be described with a sequence of words. You can&#x27;t patent a sequence of words, so all patents should be invalid.<p>> This appears to be the source of the nonsense. You aren&#x27;t distinguishing between the words (or algorithms) that describe a thing and the thing itself.<p>That&#x27;s exactly my point.  By saying that software isn&#x27;t patentable because it is simply a collection of mathematical algorithms, you aren&#x27;t distinguishing between the algorithms that describe the thing and the thing itself.  Software is literally a collection of data and algorithms, yes, just like a digital photograph.  (Although you could stretch further and define data as simply a single-purpose algorithm.)  And legally a &quot;collection of algorithms&quot; cannot be patented.  But in reality, much like the photograph, there is a great deal more to software than that; there is thought and creativity involved in &quot;collecting&quot; those algorithms.  Saying software is a collection of algorithms is akin to saying a book is a collection of words.  Literally true, but missing the bigger picture.<p>And yes, I understand the difference between patent and copyright.  I was simply giving an example of something else - a digital photo - that is exactly like software: a collection of data and algorithms.  Does that mean that exactly the same laws should apply to software as to digital photographs (and everything else that is simply a collection of data and math)?  Of course not, because these things are fundamentally <i>different</i>, and are each more than the sum of their parts.",1403330218

7924306,comment,7922028,7924278,9,0,majika,,,"Can you please explain how markets address overharvesting and pollution, and examples of that happening? If your point is that states can overharvest and pollute too, sure - of course they can. They probably <i>will</i> if they&#x27;re corrupt. My point was that only states can <i>stop</i> it: see the legislation on whaling, fishing, poaching, emissions regulations and taxation, ...<p>On misinformation, you made the (unrelated) point that states are corruptible. Yes, they are; so are markets (e.g. LIBOR) and companies (i.e. employees acting contrary to the company&#x27;s interest).<p>Corruption occurs when the people involved are undesirable, and the reward outweighs the risk of being caught. In states where the electorate cares and is informed, undesirables are less likely to be elected, and there&#x27;s a higher risk of being caught. Ideally, the bureaucrats involved in choosing who to give the contract to (the bureaucrats being directly affected by the decision, because the government is smaller) would tip off the local broadcaster that the decision was rigged, and they would investigate.<p>I think it&#x27;s more likely for corruption to be unveiled in states than there is in markets or companies. The larger the company, the smaller the chance - and free markets tend towards multinational monopolies anyway (&quot;efficiency&quot; and all that).<p>My mention of misinformation was referring to things like: the media reporting on celebrities rather than legislation, or misleading advertising, or the media being paid to report a certain way or avoid a certain story. These actions have negative externalities, and the markets won&#x27;t stop them. What the market wants (more celebrity stories, or fewer oil spill stories) isn&#x27;t always what the market should get.<p>It should be illegal to use antibiotics in agriculture, yet the markets love them.

However solutions for most of these have been found<p>a) over-harvesting : only a problem in a non-fully-privatized situation (in other words, the more government involvement, the more you have this problem). This one is actually an argument FOR capitalism.<p>b) pollution is also a tragedy of the commons thing, and could be solved by privatisation. Of course, in the real world that presents some challenges.<p>c) misinformation : this is not a problem of capitalism at all. Or rather, it&#x27;s a problem that solves itself under capitalism (though not necessarily to people&#x27;s liking). For example, insurance can fix this. Under central planning systems, every one I&#x27;ve ever seen, the problem is not so much misinformation, but the total lack of relevant information at all (e.g. employing the mayor&#x27;s daughter in your management structure gets you the contract for city IT, good luck finding that info. Oh and if you&#x27;re an idealist : good luck preventing that from happening).<p>d) antibiotics misuse : well, on one hand this is happening partly due to misuse. However, where do you have any data whatsoever that it wouldn&#x27;t happen without misuse ? As far as I can tell antibiotics resistance happened even before WWII, when we were definitely not wasting antibiotics. At any rate, the ship has sailed and it&#x27;s a sunk cost at this point. We should not waste money and resources fighting it, as even massive effort can only slightly reduce the rate here, it can&#x27;t fix it.<p>(one theory I found is that what&#x27;s happening is simply that we are effectively raising the price of new and therefore working antibiotics, dampening their use, until a balance with nature is found. Sadly, it is blatantly obvious that in order for this to actually happen, the vast majority of the sick would need to go untreated, so there simply isn&#x27;t a good solution, capitalist or government)",1403327885
7924277,comment,7920108,7920265,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"If only. But no.<p>What happens when FAB technology stagnates, everything locks in place and micro-processor advancement halts? Nope, it takes years for the state of the art FAB technology to trickle down everywhere. All the while getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. That state of the art smartphone in your pocket, it uses processors fabbed using 28nm technology. Even switching to 14nm technology would quadruple the transistor count and allow a corresponding increase in performance. Also, as FAB costs come down it would be more and more cost effective to increase chip sizes up to the maximum feasible die size, further increasing performance. Meanwhile, as former state of the art processor manufacturing becomes cheaper and cheaper it becomes more and more ubiquitous. So now not only your CPU but also your flash storage is made using 14nm technology, and maybe they decide to cram a shit-ton of micro-controlling processing power in there (they already do) and a bunch of static ram for caching or whatever, and performance keeps improving. Meanwhile, the processors and controllers in the radio system, on the cell towers, in the switches and routers, and in desktop and server devices keep getting faster and cheaper too. So now you have a butt-load of resources &quot;in the cloud&quot; or &quot;the fog&quot; or whatever idiom you want to ascribe to the phenomenon, all available for making sloppy code run faster and better.<p>Ah, but wait, there&#x27;s more. This is all the boring stuff, but there&#x27;s crazy stuff out there too. Memristors are almost certainly the future of computing in more ways than one, and so far it looks like they&#x27;ll be as feasible to manufacture and as practical as we&#x27;ve theorized. With durable storage that has access times faster than modern ram the performance bottlenecks of the past (which have rarely been in CPU and have more often been in I/O or RAM) will fall by the wayside. <i>Pocket</i> sized computers will have terabytes of non-volatile super RAM. You can write 3D renderers in javascript and they&#x27;ll run at 4k resolution / 60 fps with detail beyond what state of the art GPUs are capable of pushing today.<p>So no, the hardware train isn&#x27;t coming to a stop, in many ways it hasn&#x27;t even started yet.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that caring about quality and writing highly efficient code isn&#x27;t worthwhile, but it does mean that there probably won&#x27;t be a big mean performance bottleneck forcing everyone to get their shit together in the near future.",1403327786

Clearly an owner has more right than his tenant to determine where his property is rented, especially if their lease agreement prohibits short term rentals.<p>If Airbnb received a legal notice from a property owner demanding it delist his property, it seems like they would have to comply. Otherwise they might face a pretty simple case of negligence for listing an owner&#x27;s property for rent without his approval.

I think the issue is either they don&#x27;t care, or there&#x27;s no easy way to do it. Perhaps somebody should set up a service that facilitates this process by reducing it to uploading a copy of the lease agreement and ownership records, then sending a request to Airbnb.

7924259,comment,7923807,7924083,2,0,grey-area,,,"Platform independence isn&#x27;t really a big deal. Apple managed this just fine with fat binaries, and you could have an analogous system on Android without problems and a build chain that automatically cross-compiled (easy in golang). Developers wouldn&#x27;t even have to notice. The size of binaries is often a small part of the total size of the app - resources tend to take up much more room.<p>The real problem would be porting all the current APIs. If Google actually decided to do this though it would be a good opportunity to clean up the current APIs and provide a new version free from legacy cruft. So it is doable, but a fair amount of work to provide UI bindings etc.<p>The obstacles are more political and monetary than technical.",1403327233

7924254,comment,7923849,7924202,2,0,neurobro,,,"When I was an apartment dweller, the noise, constant flow of people, and feeling of insecurity (and silverfish) went with the territory because that&#x27;s the type of place I could afford. If I had been in a nice, quiet apartment with pleasant neighbors, I would have been wary of being evicted for violating the lease unless the risk of my &quot;guests&quot; causing a problem was very low.<p>That&#x27;s why I have to wonder what the real situation is. I see a few complaints about disturbances with nothing being done by the landlord (which is what I&#x27;d expect at my old slum apartment), but nobody complaining about <i>being</i> evicted for using Airbnb (which is what I&#x27;d expect if a tenant were to turn a nice apartment building into a party hotel, as some complainers insinuate).<p>In any case, this seems like a problem that already has a resolution: Evict people for subletting if the contract prohibits it, regardless of whether the customers were found on a web site or in the back alley.",1403326961

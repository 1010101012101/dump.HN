But if they do start new ventures, expect a whole-hearted and long term effort.  (Kindle is one such effort that is just getting started, so I'd be very impressed if they launch another so soon.)",1249962327
754606,comment,754426,754426,0,0,ctb9,,,"My immediate advice is to include links to some of your best work in this thread or better yet in your HN profile. Where better to show off your skills than on the leading online community of entrepreneurs? Finding a job, especially one that doesn't suck, is a full-time job in and of itself.<p>In the longer term, if you have the money for it, a Masters in CS is likely a worthwhile financial investment, but spending two (or more) years of your life doing something you aren't excited about is a poor use of your most valuable resource.<p>You seem (I stalked your other posts) like you have the skills and the desire to start your own business. Is your only hold-up the lack of a good idea? If so, email me. I found myself in a similar situation this spring, minus any programming knowledge, and I still decided to take the leap.",1249962306

Meanwhile, Bret Taylor was the PM for Google Local (and I think Jim Norris was involved with this too).  Google Maps happened when the Local team met the Earth team and started talking about what they could do to get all this cool satellite imagery with desktop-like interaction into a browser.<p>Also, arguably Bret and Jim were the leads at FriendFeed, since they came up with the original idea.  AFAIK, they approach PB and Sanjeev as investors, and the latter figured that not only would they invest, but they'd sign on as cofounders.",1249961893

Twitter has supplanted it.<p>Twitter is great for exactly the reason that most people hate it.  It fills the void while I'm sitting in line at Fry's or something; I can immediately see what some of my friends are doing simply by looking at my blackberry, as well as give them totally pointless updates like ""omg I HATE THE LINES AT FRY'S!"" (you can see all of my stupid, inane tweets here: <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/blhack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twitter.com/blhack</a>).<p>Facebook also just feels like there is <i>too</i> much going on...twitter does exactly one thing and it does it very well.<p>For instance, I have a really fantastic pocket knife that a good friend bought me a few years ago.  It has all sorts of tools, one of them is a screwdriver.  Needless to say, it is not as good as...well...a screw drive.  Facebook's status updates, and twitter's ""tweets"", while similar, just aren't really the same thing.<p>Finally, there are a few people that I ""stalk"" on twitter that most likely have no idea who I am.  One of them is a Poet from the UK...I get to see things like ""I am release a few limited edition first run CDs from my original demo...get them while they're hot"" (he is actually a rapper...but got started doing poetry jams.  I feel dirty saying I follow a rapper).  There is somebody called ""Yuffster"" (I thinks she is a famous dev of some sort?  I don't know there was a post on here a while ago of ""must-follow"" twitterers and she was one of them...actually she was the ONLY one I kept following, everybody else tweeted like 100 times a day.)<p>Sorry, facebook, but you have lost my eyeballs.

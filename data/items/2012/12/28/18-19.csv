4978943,comment,4978282,4978282,3,0,ruswick,,,"In my opinion, passive investing rarely has the capacity to earn someone a substantial amount of money. Large, stable returns occur in only two situations: 1) You invested a huge amount of initial money, so even a low yield returns a lot of money. (This is, from my understanding, how a lot of super-wealthy people do it. Stored wealth perpetually generates income. If one has a massive amount of stored wealth, they earn a massive amount of passive income.) or 2) You invest over long periods of time.<p>Making large amount of money in short periods of time through investing necessitates either making a very active, labor-intensive investment (like buying a small company or flipping houses), or resorting to speculation. Obviously, this is not passive.<p>The market is self-correcting. It's absurd to believe that one can earn prodigious amounts of money quickly, predictably, and effortlessly.<p>However, you should take this with a huge grain of salt. I am not an experienced investor. (In fact, I'm fairly sure that the law prohibits someone my age from investing. Even if it didn't, I wouldn't be in a financial position to invest anyway.)",1356720980

It eventually turned around, but locked up all my capital until it did.<p>Basically, I refuse all conventional stock investing advice. I never diversify; at most my portfolio has two positions at a time. And I invest upwards of 90% of my cash on most trades. I do not trade on margin (well, technically I do because I don't wait for trades to clear before taking my next position)--but I don't buy stock than cash I have in the account. I only buy heavily traded equities; trading volume over a million shares and over a billion dollar market cap. And I focus on stocks with more or less sound fundamentals that are showing recent swings in price. Apple is a good example.<p>But as for a being highly methodical and data driven--I'm not. I have a few simple rules and am patient. I generally exit positions after 1-3%. And then I have a few that I let ride. It doesn't take much to hit 40% that way.<p>I spend less than an hour a week doing research and monitoring my position. I don't have any magic edge. But I'm making money, so continue chug along.

Think Alpha-, Alpha, Alpha+ and Alpha++. These types of cities tend to strive towards homogeneity. I had a history prof (who leaned towards socialism) lay out and explain how, historically, the bigger a city gets, the less unique and further away from its ancestors and traditions it culturally becomes. Cultural hegemony.<p>Metropolitan cities: Then there are 'medium-size' cities, or 'second major cities' that fight to keep some traditions and cultures from their respective countries. Some metropolitan cities strive to be more cosmopolitan, and have that sensation; I'm thinking of a few (very few) Beta-, Beta, and Beta+ cities here.<p>During the French Revolution, there were two major schools of thought in Spain. One went like this: Bonaparte wants to modernise countries and wage war on 'tradition'; let's join the French movement and abolish our backward traditions. These people, in Spain, were called 'afrancesados' ('Frenchifieds', pro-French), pejoratively. They were found in major Spanish cities.<p>Here is the really important part: people outside of major Spanish cities thought they were protecting the 'real' Spanish culture; they were often of humble birth, people that had given rise to what people outside of Spain thought was 'very Spanish' (flamenco, cante jondo, running of the bulls, gypsies, etc.) from a cultural perspective. They had traditions; old traditions. They were superstitious, street-smart, but they were also deceived by kings and, to use a modern term, their governments.<p>I don't see much has changed with regard to cultural representation.<p>The government projects/sells an image of their country to foreigners. Some people buy into it. The reality is that not only is each country vastly different, each region and city is.<p>We should be comparing cities with cities, not countries with countries.",1356720778

4978923,comment,4970836,4971856,1,0,csense,,,"> 5-6% global growth of the 1950s-60s<p>> The overarching story is still faster-than-exponential<p>I've heard a lot of people lately incorrectly using the word ""exponential"" to just mean ""pretty fast.""  It has a specific mathematical meaning which you clearly don't know, but which you <i>should</i> know if you're going to throw around words like ""exponential.""<p>If growth over the period you're talking about has 6% per year as an upper bound, that's really saying it's bounded above by some curve of the form<p><pre><code>  f(t) = k0*1.06^t\n</code></pre>\nwhere k0 is the GDP at the start of your period.  The function f(t) is an exponential function.  So your growth is <i>not</i> ""faster-than-exponential"" since it's bounded above by an exponential function.<p>The only way you can get faster-than-exponential growth is if the percentage growth of GDP is <i>itself</i> growing every year.  Needless to say this will eventually become ridiculously fast growth:  If we started out with a GDP 1% a year in 1950, and say GDP advanced .5% per year after that, we'd currently be experiencing 31% economic growth per year.

We rented a small car and my wife told me ""are you sure this will work at 4,000 meters high? (13,100 feet)"" - we were going to be travelling around some small towns and one of the roads reached that altitude. Stupidly enough, I replied to her ""sure... these are modern cars, with fuel injection and smart oxygenation"".<p>The roads were covered with snow, and suddenly we got stuck in a snow-covered road. Being a firefighter (trained in rescue) I had some idea of what I had to do... but of course, no shovel or any other tool to remove the snow. For 1 hour or so I tried to remove the snow with no luck. I got into the car, told my wife that the smartest thing would be to <i>stay in the car</i>. If necessary, the fuel in the car would keep us worm for days.<p>After some time, a car came down the road and helped us out... only to get stucked again, this time because the car actually got de-oxygenated at exactly 4,000 meters... Luckily this time the same car was behind us for a few minutes and we could push the car until the downhill.<p>Now we tell the story with friends and laugh about it.

I'm the pressureNET developer and I'm frustrated not just at the lack of good forecasts but also at the lack of easy-to-access recent weather.<p>I have made a similar post to r/android asking if they are interested as well, since this will start with an Android app before it goes anywhere else. See http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/15l0fw/is_randroid_interested_in_a_recent_weather_app/ if you're interested.<p>When travelling to a different city it's nice to know what the weather will be like. But for me, it's much, much more important to find out what the weather was like recently. For example, I'm in Vancouver right now but I'll be in Toronto and Montreal in a few days. Now, I happen to know that there was an epic snowstorm there because I'm a weather nut and I don't live under a rock. But what if I didn't know? The forecast is sunny and cold for the next little while. I've also been thinking about this since we just put our pressureNET data archive online with our visualization tool at http://pndv.cumulonimbus.ca. It struck me that...nobody else seems to be doing that!<p>So I'm starting to build this Android app to show you the recent weather for whatever city you'd like. I'll probably add widgets. And pretty graphics of course.<p>Does this interest you? I could probably have a Beta ready within a week, and of course the source code will be open and published on GitHub.<p>I have an additional motivation for this. pressureNET is now costing more than $100 / month and I'm looking for a way to get Cumulonimbus to be profitable. Our one app for sale is T minus, but it has some bugs and doesn't provide as much utility as I was hoping, so it's not bringing in much cash. It will be possible for us to directly monetize pressureNET in the future, but that's likely a long ways off.<p>There doesn't seem to be anyone building a ""recent weather"" app (if you know of one, please tell me)! So I figure if we do a good job, we may have some small financial success with a freemium model for Recent Weather.<p>What do you think, Hacker News? Is this a viable idea with any demand for it?",1356720269

There are very few people out there who are both excellent engineers and amazing product visionaries.<p>For most startups the PM role is fulfilled by the founder's vision. However, as the company begins to grow and the initial vision is achieved, it becomes harder to go without someone focusing on the product aspect.<p>The reason someone like Stripe can do just fine without PMs is for two main reasons:\n1)Incredible market pull - they just need to be methodical about following the requests and prioritizing them in accordance with revenue/implementation sequencing/risks.\n2)Stripe's engineers are the target market - Stripe is built by developers for developers to make payments easy. Much like Jobs embodied his own target market, whenever you are building something for yourself, market research becomes a bit less important... more implicit.<p>If the above conditions are true for your startup, then absolutely, you can follow the example.

And then people don't sell and you don't get the tax revenue, but you get the economic distortion.<p>The way you fix the distortion is by accounting for it. If someone sells an investment asset and then uses the money to purchase another investment asset, allow them to roll over the basis into the new asset. Then there is no distortion because you can trade investment assets for one another with no change in tax liability or tax realization.<p>Which is actually kind of cool now that I'm thinking about it, because it's kind of like a consumption tax that only applies to investment income -- the money gets taxed when they spend it on something that isn't an investment, but poor people whose money doesn't come from investment sources don't pay the tax. Which means you can have a substantial tax rate without a lot of distortion -- or at least, the distortion would be to encourage the rich to invest rather than spend.

I say reasonable because MTs can get pretty extreme in their tread pattern, which will really hurt your stopping distance on ice. Extreme MTs have very little rubber touching the road. On my truck I have Goodyear Wrangler SilentArmor tires, which are rated for on/off-road and extreme snow. I wouldn't recommend them as street tires, as they are loud and wear very quickly on pavement, but just as an example of truck ""snow"" tires, ATs and MTs often serve the same purpose as snow tires, as well as giving you a better ability to get back on the road if you've gone off in a muddy or rough area.<p>ATs wear quicker than all-seasons (~50,000 miles). MTs wear extremely quickly (~30,000 miles). Normal all-season tires generally wear at ~60,000 miles.<p>-edit- also, before buying studded tires, check to see if they're legal in your state/country, and make a note of the legality dates. Many times they're only legal from November through March (studded tires damage the road when the road is dry). Tire chains are temporary solutions, but are practically illegal in many states (can only be used if the chain never touches the road surface).",1356717938

However, all of the information was incomplete - they didnt know we were an LLC, who owned the company, etc etc.<p>This meant that when I tried to apply for a Company iOS Dev license, I hit the same problem you did. Apple's background check (done through D&B/DUNS), totally failed, and I was black listed.<p>I called Apple, they told me to sign up as an individual, and then do my work there while I update my DUNS information, at iupdate.dnb.com. Currently, I'm waiting the 15 days after updating to re-apply for Apple's business dev account, while the databases get in sync.<p>You DO NOT need to pay for a DUNs number, however, they obviously want to upsell you for expedited service. I wouldn't do it. They get paid a healthy sum from Apple every year, and you are not their client, Apple is.<p>Try to do whatever you are doing as an individual developer, get a hold of the DUNS number/update info, and ask Apple to upgrade your account after the fact.<p>Best of luck<p>Charlie",1356717785

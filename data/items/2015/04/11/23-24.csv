Neither you nor your family are safe if you happen to be in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk, or Portsmouth.  The police departments and commonwealths attorneys in these jurisdictions have a disgusting perversion of the concept of &#x27;equal protection of the laws,&#x27; they simply decide that some individuals deserve to be abused and the perpetrators of crimes against them shall be unsanctioned, free to roam the streets and able to possess firearms.  Certain people in the community are free to commit crimes due to their political or social connections, and they are protected and permitted to hold government jobs within various agencies of these cities such as the police departments and school boards.",1428796761

You can&#x27;t say &quot;I&#x27;m not getting out of the car until my mother arrives, understand?&quot;. You can&#x27;t pull back when an officer tries to forcefully remove you from the  car, or put up your fists as if you are going to punch the officer. You can&#x27;t do that 10+ times and imagine that you will not get maced/tased/etc.<p>> Any officer can make that claim, its a BS claim that is used to justify aggressive force<p>You know, isn&#x27;t it weird that the officer had this &quot;BS&quot; claim, and it turns out that the person who was tasered <i>did</i> have marijuana on him, and was charged with possession and intent to sell?

If he would have just stepped out of the car, and let the cops search him(where they would eventually find the marijuana he was planning on selling), no force would have been necessary. He would have just been arrested and charged with intent to sell. Now he has resisting arrest on his record too.<p>>  The smell of marijuana is a tactic used by police to try to upset you<p>Or, you know, the officer did actually smell marijuana. I agree with you that a cop can make up the reason, but that cops can <i>never</i> smell weed, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here since there actually was marijuana in the car.<p>> These people had every right to stay in the car<p>No, they didn&#x27;t. Probable cause was established and the officers were within their rights to ask them to step out of the car so a search could be performed.<p>> They&#x27;re only trying to provoke you into doing something they can then use to justify their force<p>No. They did not provoke the kid to refuse to get out of the car, and they did not provoke him to pull away multiple times when pulling him out of the car.",1428796759

While this problem can affect anybody, I suspect the these feeling about feasibility of change affect the people that create modern technologies in a specific way: it distracts and hides just how much power <i>we</i> retain, that cannot be collected by the people trying to place themselves at the top of rapidly centralizing power structures.<p>The power I&#x27;m referring to is the power retained by whomever is <i>actually implementing</i> the world we live in. A tyrant can issue all the orders and threats they want - unless someone caries out those orders, the tyrant is just making a lot of hot air. Implementation is what matters in the end, and I think the readers of HN have a pretty good idea who it is that will end up implementing our future.<p>So the next time someone asks you to implement some bit of the surveillance state, use your power and let some bit of that future go unimplemented. It may be a trivially small thing that may not affect much in the long run. Those little things add up, and the message it sends is important.<p>I realize that it is hard to take a stand. There is always the possibility of being fired - or worse. Just remember that the engineers working around technology have an advantage over the typical &quot;protest&quot; crowds of the past: the people that want to use the surveillance state need engineers to make their tools. So take advantage of any little bit of power that you have and hold the line in some small way against this creeping tyranny. Above all, remember that tools like this very forum are available.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there is no risk, and I&#x27;m not saying there won&#x27;t have consequences. What I am suggesting is that unless we start making these principled stands <i>right now</i>, the situation is only going to get worse, and the sacrifices required to fix this situation only rise with time.<p>Please. This is our future, and as clichée as it sounds, there is a lot of truth to the idea that the real power comes form strength in numbers.<p>==<p>/* speaking of the power held by engineers...

9361298,comment,9360827,9361147,0,0,Sanddancer,,,"Pretty much everything you said is wrong. There are indeed ports that occasionally require you to rebuild a bunch of downstream packages, but the default for a while has been to move the old libraries, etc into /usr/local/lib/compat/pkg so that new stuff will continue running.<p>Regarding rolling back/forward, the ports system allows you to create binary packages from your build. So, if you&#x27;re in a production environment, the old version of the package still is there, ready to be reinstalled with all your compile flags intact.<p>Verification is also something that ports does. Because ports work with the pkg system, installing a port installs it in a package, with hashes and everything. Auditing&#x27;s a no brainer there.<p>Furthermore, the ports system allows you to build everything within jails dedicated to port building, so every time you update, you get fresh packages with no legacy dependencies.<p>Oh, and one more thing. That&#x27;s just the steps FreeBSD has made. OpenBSD does not have a rolling ports tree, the ports tree is tied to a specific version, which creates binary packages by default, without installing the port to your filesystem. So, again, you get everything apt and rpm can do, plus you get a level of flexibility that they can&#x27;t match.",1428796307

That package is then like any other package on the system, and can be cleanly removed, or upgraded from into a newer upstream release, etc.<p>These are important features. They&#x27;re not important for j-random-user, but they&#x27;re important to distribution maintainers, and to sysops who have to, for example, apply temporary hotfixes to specific packages on their production machines <i>until</i> the distribution ships those same fixes, at which point they want to revert to upstream.",1428794128

Having to focus on multiple things at once, instead of focusing on one with pinpoint accuracy is painful. You do what you gotta do, and you will get there.<p>Our company has built a foundation for Strong AI, and an autonomous robotic framework that connects Robotics to third party AI. Google has spent over a billion dollars the last couple years buying companies in these two areas, and we are going to beat them connecting AI to Robotics by months, and we have been developing our technology for 3 years. AI, and Robotics were Y!Combinator&#x27;s top 2 desired business categories, and we didn&#x27;t even get an interview.<p>In summary don&#x27;t stop, but do look for alternative options to getting to your next milestone in regards to funding.

But 10 smart physicists could probably think &quot;as hard&quot; as a single Newton. This means there is no need to chase the expert. This removes inaccuracies, since groups have more variance in opinion than individuals. It is harder for groups to be all wrong. Group intelligence benefits science.<p>> Conspire? Undermine the wisdom? Wow...<p>See it as game theory with possibly adversarial agents going against the group consensus. If there is no incentive to go against the grain, or if there is damage possible to your reputation (and thus energy), people will not disagree with top management or thought leaders. All errors trickle down into the group without filters. This is dangerous as it mimics group intelligence, but is really the opinion of a single individual inside a group of yes-men. This contributes to economic crashes and hype-y bubbles.<p>Blood-letting is a good example of variant group behavior. We need people &quot;insane&quot; enough to try that. We need to be wrong many times, for someone to say: &quot;this is not right.&quot; and help fix it.

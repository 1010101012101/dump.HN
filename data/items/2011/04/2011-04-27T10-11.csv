It makes your code easier to refactor with fewer hard-references to maintain.

You can learn to use CLI (Command Line Interface) too, in either OS you are using... Windows has what used to be called MS-DOS, and MacOS has a Unix CLI under the hood, which is very similar to a Linux CLI. It is a well known fact that CLI is much more powerful than GUI and allows to do many more things, but it has a steeper learning curve. If you are willing to learn CLI commands, you should loose your fears, and start by the basics, step by step, read a lot and ask in the apropiate forums when you get stuck. There's a handy command called 'man' (without the quotes), for manual, and that will give you additional reference to most commands. First you must understand linux file system, file permissions, and user roles. You might already know that there is a user called root which has permission to do anything on a linux/unix system. It is usually denoted in the prompt as #, while a regular user is denoted as $. Good luck!",1303898534

People on HN may be killing time, but the majority still have some quality standards for what they want to read.  Gaming HN isn't worth as much because A) there's fewer people, and B) you have to work harder to game it.  Other niche sites can easily share this quality.<p>But for a site like Digg that wants to be the biggest social news site, it's just a race to the bottom.

That raises the buy-in stakes beyond what people only interested in promotion are willing to spend time on, as well as lowering the potential gains from promotion (you got your article read, but directly on k5, not via traffic to any monetizable endeavor of yours).

We've been hearing about the ""information economy"" for 30 years now. Why is 2010 suddenly its long-awaited triumph? The 1980s' argument was the advent of the widely accessible personal computer, and the 1990s' argument was the rollout of the internet to the general public. What's the 2010s' argument?",1283414513

How many accounts need to be involved to make a particular story get to the front page?<p>I'm sure that the answers respectively are, ""rather few"", ""the vast majority"" and ""not many"".  And there you have the raw ingredients for a voting ring to form.  As a matter of principle I would never be involved with such, and I have a natural dislike for anyone that I think is.  But the ingredients are there.<p>More than that, you still have a popularity effect.  People who vote on new articles have to prioritize what they read in some fashion.  Speaking personally, it is natural to choose to look at articles with interesting titles, or which are submitted by someone you recognize as being a consistent source of good content.  Therefore if someone like patio11 submits an article, it has a significant advantage.  As does anything involving YC.  (Of course promoting YC is the whole point of this site, so I don't mind that at all.  And I'm guilty at looking at content from people I trust before content from people I've never heard of.)<p>Memory says that jacquesm mentioned once that he had turned down an offer of money to post certain articles from companies that were looking for good pr.  (I don't swear that I correctly remember who it was.)  He may have turned them down, but I'm sure they asked again, and if they asked around enough I'm sure that they found a taker.  And if so, then you have the dark side here on HN.",1283414416

I can't help thinking on that with regard to AirBnB - if they started up demanding full ID, who would use them? Who trusts giving their full ID to a little known company? Nobody. So they start up with a reputation based trust system because that's the only option they have. Now they've got lots of users, big investment, and a horrible event twisting their arm to do something (e.g. requiring ID which they couldn't do before, or spending more on security staff teams which they couldn't afford before), and it might not hurt them much to do so.<p>Viewed from the future with hindsight, perception shifts to show them as a large company with a shady past ""a very insecure system to gain traffic followed by a switchover to a legitimate system"".<p>(This is not the same thing as saying AirBnB planned bad things, it's a musing on how things happen and how things are perceived.).",1312152885

At the same time I find it important that at some point when you've done a lot of analysis on a lot of evidence over a long time, not to waffle about contradictory opinions that a hard look will show have little to no substance, because it's just a giant and completely uninteresting waste of time, and trying to debate every person who is wrong on the Internet who demands you provide a complete body of analysis and evidence that the Earth is not in fact flat, could easily absorb and completely waste every waking moment of one's life.<p>I also find it tremendously important to respect every person, even when I don't believe or respect an analysis or opinion of theirs, both as a basic axiom of human existence and because doing so makes me happier and because it's the only way to open the other person to a reasoning dialog, and obviously I haven't quite mastered that yet but I am practicing.  I admire that you kept to an honest effort at reasoned debate after my exasperated flame.<p>With that said, I'm puzzled how after citing Feynman's Cargo Cult Science lecture and the importance of looking to rebut the strongest evidence rather than the weakest in an opposing view and looking straight to original scientific findings instead of to meta-meta-opinionating, the one real argument you bring up is Landsea's resgination letter.<p>The worldwide efforts to study the Earth's climate and to study what we might want to do about it involve untold thousands of people around the entire world for years on end.  What are the chances that some one human being somewhere in there doesn't spend every moment of their life behaving in an absolutely rational and honest manner?  And if the chances of that are non-zero, how much do all the molecules in the Earth's oceans and atmosphere care about that?  And if those molecules don't care, what would you find a more useful focus of inquiry on which to spend your brain's finite operational lifetime?",1312151585

2982455,comment,2981771,2982080,8,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>app stores which are dictatorships</i><p>The 1990s called. They want their metaphor back.<p>Let's face it: The ""dictatorship"" metaphor was fun (Remember the cartoons with the X-wing fighter torpedoing the AT&T Death Star logo? Good times.) but it was probably overwrought even back in the old days when DOS software and Mac software and each of the 23 different Unices were binary incompatible and emulation was dog slow and virtualization was like science fiction and choosing a platform felt like proposing marriage. But now? It might even be a <i>dangerous</i> line of thinking. You need to learn to think like your customer, and <i>they</i> don't see this oh-so-crucial distinction between ""native apps"" and ""web apps"". Except to the extent that web apps are a trifle more difficult to find: Instead of finding the pretty icon and touching it, you have to touch Safari and then type the name of your desired app into the Googles.<p>(No, of course the average customer doesn't know how to bookmark a URL. They don't know what a URL <i>is</i>.)<p>A defining characteristic of the metaphorical ""dictatorship"" is that people can't vote. In particular: They can't vote with their feet, because the wall is too high or the ocean too wide or the border guards (on whichever side of the border) are too expensive to bribe. But there are only two kinds of native-app platforms today:<p>A) The platforms in which a full-featured HTML5-compliant browser is at most two clicks away at any time;<p>B) The platforms that are being crushed to death by iOS, Android, and the other platforms in Category A.<p>Where's the big barrier here? Half of my native apps <i>embed</i> entire HTML5 web pages. Or they link out to HTML5 web pages. Meanwhile, an increasing quantity of web pages prompt me to install native apps. The answer to ""web apps or native apps"" is ""both"", to the degree that they <i>interpenetrate and are inseparable</i>, and what reason is there to believe that this won't continue?<p>Developers obviously care about their release schedules and their profit share and the backend technology underlying each and every screen on the phone, but customers don't know and they don't much care.",1315688053

Call it a decade for the timely ones, and much more than that for the rest. A few of the updates would be along the lines of ""This needs to change from the future tense."" For example, this brief review of the iPhone from 2001:<p><i>With Web-based software, most users won't have to think about anything except the applications they use. All the messy, changing stuff will be sitting on a server somewhere, maintained by the kind of people who are good at that kind of thing. And so you won't ordinarily need a computer, per se, to use software. All you'll need will be something with a keyboard, a screen, and a Web browser. Maybe it will have wireless Internet access. Maybe it will also be your cell phone. Whatever it is, it will be consumer electronics: something that costs about $200, and that people choose mostly based on how the case looks. You'll pay more for Internet services than you do for the hardware, just as you do now with telephones.</i>",1315686707

Your page title doesn't include any relevant keywords, and there is zero indexable content on the page - all the text is in images, which don't even have alt text. For a couple of quick wins, do some keyword research around your subject (use the Google Keyword Tool to find some relevant keywords with low comp / relatively ok volume) and use these in your title and page content (alt tags, if you don't want to change the page).<p>EDIT: Also, put Google Analytics on there, so that you can start to collect data ASAP on where your potential customers are coming from.<p>EDIT 2: You might want to distill the app idea down to a few key benefits on the landing page.

Well, not <i>killed</i>, but demoted to ""one supported language of many"". And the sooner this is started, the better, because it is a long, long process.  I don't think JavaScript is <i>bad</i>, but I do strongly feel that the underlying engine for client side web programming should be a full-blown VM that supports many possible source languages (ala modern .net with the CLR, DLR and all), and I'll support that model regardless of who pushes it, so long as they do a good job on the technical side and don't try to use it as a lock-in mechanism.   Google seems to be the most posed to do this (I can't imagine Microsoft giving up that much control of .net) and their idea to support JavaScript as an interim target is the only practical way this will ever be solved, so I hope Dart is successful -- assuming it is actually going for this and not just trying to switch one core language out with another, which remains to be seen when they announce more information.<p>BTW, yes, I know you can already compile many other languages to JavaScript (as Dart itself will do in the first stage), but.. why?  Why not just put a proper VM down there that is truly designed to efficiently run byte-code from many different source languages, and have JavaScript be one of those languages?",1315686628

The earlier you can find these defects, the easier it is to fix. There's a perception that internationalisation defects are easy fixes, just updating a messages file.

That is <i>what would it be like if it were perfect?</i> Would there be a mandatory licensing fee for scripts? Would there be non-discriminatory rights for theatres? What?<p>Someone needs to sit down and <i>design</i> a way to disrupt Hollywood. That requires three things, production disruption (how movies get made), distribution disruption (how they get distributed), and consumption disruption (how they get consumed).<p>The good news is you might have an ally here in the form of NetFlix or Amazon. They can handle distribution and consumption, which is to say they can 'sell' views via their networks. You might also get some traction with 'Fathom Events' which rents out digital theatre projectors for pay per view events.<p>You don't yet have a way of disrupting production.<p>To do that you probably need to re-create the old 'studio' model where you have a staff of production people and actors. A couple of sound stages with solid green-screen technology, and your own 'pocket' CGI capability for putting together scenes. That is your 'back lot' equivalent.<p>More importantly you need a disruptive business model. That is because as it stands bankers and other sources of capital understand exactly who gets rich and who gets screwed in the  movie industry, in your new model they won't know and they thus they won't be able to understand how much (or how little) risk there is to their capital. And you will need a lot of capital to make movies or 'serials' (Think of them as sporadic TV shows where the episodes don't necessarily come out every Tuesday at 8PM)<p>This is going to take some strategic planning and understanding exactly what things <i>really</i> cost. I worked on this sort of project to understand how the periodical publishing market was to be disrupted (and to identify business opportunities in the disrupted market) and its painful. There was no source of 'how much do editors make?', 'journalists?', 'folks who run printing presses'? 'folks to drive vans to drop off papers/magazines?' You really need to open up a business from the inside, and dissect it to understand how it works, where the money goes, and what the leverage is of each of the individual pieces. But understand that doing this sort of dissection gives you to knowledge of  <i>how to disrupt</i> and that means the person sharing it with you, if they aren't already committed to joining the revolution, is writing their own death sentence. Ouch!<p>The best you can hope for is to approach the problem like the CIA trying to infiltrate an enemy government. Develop assets, interview people who are fired or leave, do forensic accounting on suppliers and contractors and unions. Not easy, you are a threat, the people who have the power know you are a threat and they will do things to slow you down or stop you.<p>So take the current players and develop a parallel track. It will be hard, and it will be expensive, and it will be beset with issues the entrenched folks throw at you. But you do need a solid strategic plan and good backing.",1315685397

JavaScript sometimes gets into pages embedded in script tags (as opposed to be being loaded from external files by script tags), and this is sometimes done by being echoed by server-side PHP or something similar.<p>Having to deal with getting the whitespace right while doing that could be annoying, and would also make the code much harder to read on the server side.<p>I think for this application, the more forgiving a language is about layout the better.",1315685039

If so, then I completely agree.  But large tablet screens, touch surfaces, pico-projectors, etc will all come, and be cheap in time.<p>Is it that there's a high density of information on an atlas?  Well, yes, there is - but this isn't necessarily a good thing.  It can be hard to focus on the information that you want.  A large LCD surface, where you can choose which layers you do and don't want, is surely better: maybe I just want to see contour and topo information, and don't want to see political boundaries.<p>Maps are awesome, and were great technology.

A colleague lended it to me, I started because the title sounded interesting, but I was thinking ""here's another cocky all-knowing hacker type giving out cool advice"". Boy, was I wrong. I first read the title essay and the truth of it struck me so much I took the day off (not literally, just hid somewhere where I coulnt be found) and finished the whole thing. That was almost three years ago. I've given quite a number of copies as presents and observed similar reactions. I go back and reread parts of the essays every now and then.<p>A good/bad analogy is a good book (or the good book), most of the advice has <i>very</i> long shelf life.<p>I created my HN account soon afterwards and applied for YC that winter (rejected).

A Peltier cooler, heater, or thermoelectric heat pump is a solid-state active heat pump which transfers heat from one side of the device to the other side against the temperature gradient (from cold to hot), with consumption of electrical energy. Such an instrument is also called a Peltier device, Peltier heat pump, solid state refrigerator, or thermoelectric cooler (TEC). The Peltier device is a heat pump: when direct current runs through it, heat is moved from one side to the other. Therefore it can be used either for heating or for cooling (refrigeration), although in practice the main application is cooling. It can also be used as a temperature controller that either heats or cools.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling</a>",1315684815

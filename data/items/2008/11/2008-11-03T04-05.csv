Also, in this story:<p><i>Let me tell you the last one. A customs officer started speaking to me in Cartman-Spanish (after a brief exchange in English) making a whole scene in front of about 50 people queuing behind me. After a while my patience was gone and I answered loudly ""I'm very sorry but you don't speak Spanish and I cannot understand what you want. You are speaking in infinitive and skipping words, so it isn't clear if you are asking where I've been, where am I going to be, or the reason of my stay. Migrations didn't have a problem, so either check my luggage or let me go."" At that point it was 50-50 he would kick me back out, but I guess the dirty looks he got from the people in the queue convinced him to just let me get through.</i><p>it seems like the only person acting like a jerk is you. All he's trying to do is speak in Spanish, and you went and made fun of him for it.",1225687814

351908,comment,351351,351753,0,0,hugh,,,"My preferred solution to this problem (bear with me for a while, since this is a pet theory I only unload very rarely):<p>Many democracies (e.g. the US, UK, Australia) have bicameral legislatures in which legislation must be passed by both houses, but where one of the houses no longer properly serves its original purpose. In the US and Australia the role of the Senate was to represent the voice of the individual states -- this doesn't happen any more and it just winds up filled with the same parties as the other house in slightly different numbers. In the UK the House of Lords was supposed to represent the interests of the nobility, but that's no longer seen as a desirable goal anyway. I'm not totally sure about the details of the systems in other countries.<p>Anyway, my suggestion is to keep the House of Representatives in its present form and replace the nonfunctional upper house with a ""House of Taxpayers"", in which the representatives are elected by voting among the nation's taxpayers with each taxpayer's vote being worth an amount proportional to the amount of tax they pay. This would ensure that any law being passed by the legislature would have to be approved both by all the people who might benefit from it (the House of Reps) and the people who would have to pay for it (the House of Tax). It might also have the added benefit of encouraging the lower classes to shift more of the tax burden onto themselves in order to have more say in how it's spent.<p>It's probably not practical to pioneer this kind of constitutional reform in any existing democracy, but I certainly think it should be considered by anyone setting up a constitution for a new one.",1225687617

351902,comment,351451,351451,0,0,niels_olson,,,"Ignoring the first 14 years of life, I've lived in<p>1) Kansas City for high school<p>2) Annapolis for college<p>3) Rhode Island for six months<p>4) San Diego for four years<p>5) Annapolis for two and a half years<p>6) New Orleans for 5 weeks to start medical school<p>7a) Lived with my parents for one year in College Station, Texas after Katrina<p>7b) Attended classes in Houston for that year<p>8) Back to New Orleans with trips to San Antonio, Houston, College Station, Washington, DC, Norfolk, Virginia, and New Haven, Connecticut.<p>If I were going to move to one of those places for the purpose of starting a start up, first, I wouldn't. Second, I'd prioritize the list like so<p>1) College Station (couldn't study for all the people talking about setting up this or that, whether they had set up their S corp, when the fiber would be laid down, etc). These people are definitely still engineers.<p>2) San Diego<p>3) Washington, DC, including Annapolis (home of Wonkette)<p>4) New Haven (mainly due to proximity to both Boston and NY)<p>5) Norfolk, VA (lots of military contracts)<p>6) San Antonio<p>7) Rhode Island<p>8) Houston<p>9) Kansas City<p>10) New Orleans<p>Why is New Orleans last? I mean, I'm here, and clearly I've learned more about programming and system admin here than anywhere. I can't believe I'm saying it, but there really is an element of old world culture down here that I will miss when I leave. And it's sort of a city within a city: you meet the people you know all over the place. And really, I've learned more from the programmers I've met here than from anyone (except my brother, who lives in San Antonio). But there are two overwhelming factors working against ever trying to do a start up here: 1) Who would ever put a server in New Orleans? 2) Tulane dismissed their entire engineering college after the storm. No hacker I know is here because it's a good place for hacking. In some ways, it awesome. But there's virtually no one here. I think I've identified all the XOs in the city, and it adds up to about 6 (it was 5 until someone in Texas mailed me a spare).<p>Why would I rank Houston below San Antonio? Houston is much larger, 4th largest city in the US. Surely there is a greater absolute number of hackers in Houston. But having lived in Houston, you would be hard-pressed to get me to move back. It's so huge and spread out and the public transit system is so non-existent that you end up spending your life in a car. And I get the sense that most people would rather live in Austin or, if they want to stay close to the engineering, they go to College Station.",1225686644

351898,comment,351713,351832,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"As much as I despise Bush, that video has very little substance. It's more bashing his mistakes than exposing his not having done what he said he would.<p>It points out some areas where he was wrong, but not really where he didn't try to do something he said. In that video, he said he'd lower taxes and end the surplus and he did. He said he'd try to fix Social Security, and in his own way he did.<p>Love him or hate him, the guy did pretty much what he told us he would. The problem was he also did a lot of stuff that was clearly never discussed, like ignore Katrina or launch the Iraq war. But that's not really hypocrisy.",1225685814

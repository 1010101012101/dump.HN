Also, we'll be keeping these up to date.  For example, when an instagram profile photo changes, it will result in broken images unless you go update it.  We're doing the queueing to make sure you don't have to.<p>Uploading - the platform we've built actually does a great number of things on the upload side.  We've limited it down to the resizing to the appropriate sizes.  The ability to use custom identifiers for your avatars lets you build the route to them instead of having to store the full path which we think is a help when putting together dynamic apps.<p>Enhancements - we're working on a number of the items you've mentioned as possible improvements down the line.

As the OP mentioned, ""Relational"" doesn't mean ""What Codd wrote in a single paper back in 1969"". It has continued to evolve, both with Codd's direct involvement and from successors like Date, Darwin, and Pascal. Codd wasn't an all-seeing, all-knowing data-management demi-god - but his general theory of relational database management and the core tenants are still super awesome. Extensions to it, as long as they don't violate the RM, are just as valid as Codd's original work.<p>That means #1 is totally relational (as an aside, you don't need ORDER BY or LIMIT for it either). Indeed, relational algebra supports aggregations (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra#Aggregation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra#Aggregation</a>).<p>It's important to separate the query language from core RDBMS theory, as the two are orthogonal. Codd suggested Relational Algebra as a reference language but never intended for it to be the only way to communicate with a RDBMS.<p>See CJ Date's excellent discussion on ORDER(BY):

I would say the most important part of this paper is the 1. the Size and 2. the Number of images. The size of the model isn't huge.<p>Most people don't realize that computer vision research is done using tiny sets of tiny images. Think hundreds to thousands of images that are 32x32 grayscale or black and white. Google did 10 million 200x200 color images.<p>For a conservative comparison human vision can be thought of as two 15 megapixel cameras capturing at 30 frames per second. (The real numbers are higher and much more complicated.)<p>I suspect that given this amount and quality of input data most machine learning algorithms would have produced better than state of the art results.<p>Now the bad. Their model totally ignored time.<p>Most computer vision researchers work with static images. In biology there is no such thing as a static image. Everything moves. You move, your eyes move, the environment moves. The brain, as an exception, can understand static images, but the rule is motion.<p>A majority of features in biological vision are tied to motion. Light/dark change cells, moving edge change cells. A <i>huge</i> portion of the information you derive from sight comes from the temporal context of a given moment. The change from moment A to moment B is directly encoded and learned and is often more important than the state at A or the state at B.<p>I'm not faulting them, in fact, I am extremely happy with their results, but I want to point out that these results can and will get <i>much</i> better in the near future as the input size increases and people start to integrate temporal features into their models.",1340736409

However, here are some things I've picked up in my studies that seemed to make sense to me as an Express user. Keep in mind I'm still a relative nodenoob, so take this with a grain of salt..<p>- Keep the actual 'route code' (i.e., code that handles your end points) in a folder, named by the function: i.e., routes/login.js<p>- The overall route map (i.e., app.get()) lives in the main app.js file or routes/index.js<p>- Use underscore.js where possible; this raises the cognitive level of your code and its become a 'standard part' of Javascript to some degree. Unfortunately the Node repl treats _ as a special value, so you can't really test with it there. Kinda sucks..<p>- Use config.js to contain database settings, default port, middleware settings, etc.<p>- Develop the more complicated parts of your code in libs/. Think of them as open source components; keep them generic and disconnected from your app itself. This increases reusability (obviously) and testability. I think it creates better code overall. Some people even npm the core ""hard parts"" of their code! This is a really interesting and freeing strategy.",1340735471

Complaining about a receivable when it has taken single-digit days to pay out is unprofessional.<p>* By working without a written contract, and in particular without any agreement as to how invoices will be paid, the freelancer <i>has</i> taken some of the responsibility for the payment drama.<p>* Choosing better clients, or (if it makes you feel better to say it this way) different kinds of projects to work on for clients, <i>will</i> produce better results for freelancers. If only because high-value projects almost never execute this carelessly.<p>* $780 is a trivial amount of money. Even for this person. By their own admission, we're talking about 12 billable hours.

4163392,comment,4163124,4163316,5,0,blueprint,,,"No one has attained Enlightenment through Zen nor meditation in human history. Buddha himself never claimed he was enlightened through meditation. That's a fabrication of Buddhist monks whose level of consciousness is quite a bit lower than that of Gautama. Nowadays, the misunderstanding has been passed down for thousands of years, so what I'm saying now seems unacceptable in modern society.<p>If you accept that meditation is a way to get Enlightenment then it opens the possibility that anyone can be Enlightened. But in human history, only one or two men had the evidence that they could perceive everything in the world and could tell the Truth. Instead, Buddhists will tell you that you have to experience things to understand and prove them. But that is not the case of a scientist, philosopher, and Enlightened Beings - all of which can immediately show evidence when they point out something in truth.<p>The term of Enlightenment means ""opening eyes to what is in the reality"". It's used similarly in Eastern languages to mean ""to realize"".<p>So a truly enlightened being can point out things in reality exactly as they are and can tell the law of how the world works.<p>So when you learn about happiness from an Enlightened Being, he doesn't teach you about sitting in meditation until you can train yourself not to care about happiness anymore.

But because the monks and Zen masters didn't learn this principle, I can realize that they don't know anything about true Buddha's teaching.<p>I'm telling you this because I'm worried that people will fall into danger practicing Zen and other forms of Buddhism. The truth in Buddha's teaching has degraded to the point that no one can know Buddha's teaching through the existent Buddhism - which although superior because of Buddha's teachings, nowadays has a similar quality to Christianity and other religions.

4163315,comment,4159596,4159962,1,0,pozablo,,,"Thinking of Outsourcing?  Beware of Elance and SynapseIndia!
Journalists interested in the following extensively documented case of perjury, abuse, conflict of interest and possibly illegal orporate collusion please contact rpm@empiricalwellness.org. 
Through Elance, Empirical Wellness, Inc. hired SynapseIndia to build a website/app that would assist healthcare providers and researchers to work with patients through cellphone services.   Almost a year after the project due date, and after receiving the majority of payments, SynapseIndia demanded  the final payment even though they had produced only an incomplete and defective website. Empirical Wellness was forced to file a Dispute with Elance which escalated to arbitration.    
Throughout the 4 months of arbitration, Empirical Wellness proved that the SynapseIndia lied throughout the development, and that the COO of SynapseIndia (Kapil Gupta)  repeatedly lied  to the arbitrators--under oath. SynapseIndia is Elances  most profitable provider, and Elance refers all their arbitration business to Net-arb.com.   Net-arb imposed no penalty for SynapseIndias perjury.  Empirical Wellness was awarded only a small refund along with the incomplete and deeply flawed code for their website.   Elance paid the financial award for SynapseIndia, and instead of providing the code as ordered, SynapseIndia sabotaged the  website and provided only useless sabotaged code.  Despite promises from Michelle in Elance's ""Dispute Assistance"" there were no consequences from Elance for the contractor's refusal  to comply with the ""binding"" arbitration.  
The undersigned personally lost about $30k and two years of work.    BTW, most of the reviews of SynapseIndia on Elance are positive.  So is mine. This is because when the due date for the project arrives (and the project is still far from complete), the client  is pressured to provide a positive review.   Not wanting to alienate a contractor who already has our money for an unfinished job,  clients like myself post positive reviews.  Then, when the work goes bad, Elance absolutely forbids any modification of the review.

Whereas MySQL, SQL Server, Postgress, Oracle - all of these products evaluate queries by interpreting their respective tree representations of your SQL queries. So which database do you expect to be faster? The one that runs native code or ones that interpret?<p>This is a huge differentiator we are talking about here.

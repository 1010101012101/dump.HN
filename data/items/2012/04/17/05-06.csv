3851382,comment,3850929,3850929,6,0,jbarham,,,"Quite apart from Americans denouncing their citizenship, this absurd tax policy is surely a strong disincentive for many ambitious and successful global entrepreneurs from considering taking out US citizenship or applying for a green card, since many of the same penalties apply.<p>In my case as a Canadian, I worked as a software engineer for 4+ years on work visas in California before relocating to Australia in late 2010.  My wife is an Aussie so I have permanent residency in Australia.<p>Although I turned off my US job site profiles, I still get emailed regularly by US recruiters asking if I'd be willing to move back to the US.  My answer is always no.  The opportunity cost of living under the restrictions of work visas in the US and playing the green card queue lottery in a potentially lousy job before your time runs out is just too high.",1334642256

I took this as a confirmation that it's time to leave the company (something I felt was approaching for some time now).<p>This is because I'm very much the guy that ""makes shit work"" (comes with being a jack-of-all-trades kind of hacker, or maybe just with giving a damn about my work). ""Hey, remember how we've set up that postfix-to-python email bot three years ago?"" - I do. ""Hey, the finance data import on the MIS is broken"" - Ok, let me have a look .. there, I fixed it. This I don't mind. In fact I quite enjoy it.<p>However, in turn I do expect something back. The first and obvious thing I expect is that you don't mind that the software project I'm working on is going to be a few days delayed because I spent time digging in the bowels of some open source tool or staring at Wireshark. The other, and maybe not so obvious thing I expect is that you a) listen to my suggestions and b) don't get in the way of me working efficiently. What this means is that if I suggest you should go with solution A and not solution B (which your pricey external consultant suggested) and I take the time to show you several good reasons (not my job either, but comes with giving a damn) why solution A will work reliably and solution B will come biting you in the ass later, then you at least hear me out.<p>And then when solution B comes biting you in the ass and you come to me to work it out, at least give me the means to sort it out properly instead of forcing me to follow your pricey consultant down the slippery slope of exceedingly horrible workarounds, all of which I have to handhold him through and waste massive amounts of time because he can't use email and needs to do schedule a conference call in several days time with subjects such as ""confirm the VPN is working"".<p>Because once I'm sufficiently annoyed, I will gladly tell your consultant that something ""isn't my job"" just so he stops bothering me. And then I write my notice, because I don't like working like this.",1334642078

3851366,comment,3850929,3850929,2,0,beagle3,,,"I estimate I spend two full work weeks a year on doing my nontrivial US taxes (and that's on top of paying a professional to actually do that -- that's just the ""homework"" he leaves me with, which he cannot do himself because he doesn't know the country's internal tax codes and language)[1]. This is an additional 4% tax on my time that is counted nowhere. And the tax professional's fees are not actually deductible because I'm in AMT regime. My effective tax rates turns out to be 10% or so above my official bracket all things considered -- in the sense that I cannot avoid paying those 10% (even if they do not go to the government's coffers -- they come out of mine)<p>I have income coming in from another country, which makes things complicated. I have to file there as well; I think it amounts to about 5 hours collected over a year to file (and that includes reporting my US based income to that country).<p>The federal US tax code is 73,000 pages. If you're an average person (you don't have fisheries or hundreds of the other special cases and exemptions), then only 5,000 pages or so are relevant to you (not the same 5,000 to every person - of course). And those 5,000 pages change ever so slightly every year.<p>If you've been doing your taxes by yourself, it is almost guaranteed that you are either overpaying or did something wrong (or both). Even if you are using a professional, the chances are extremely likely you are overpaying and/or wrong.<p>And if you are living in the US, you have state tax codes on top of that. Living in NJ and working in NY? You have two tax codes to work with and reconcile.<p>This is a complementary insane and broken part of the system to what's discussed in other responses to this posts.<p>In most european countries, if you are a salaried worker, you don't ever file anything with the IRS equivalent unless you have a nontrivial, uncommon situation (e.g., working for two employers at the same time _and_ you do not want them to know about each other; or income from abroad).<p>[1] No, I haven't been able to find someone who is qualified enough in both jurisdictions. My situation is complicated, though far from unique -- and no, as the ""other way around"" shows, a reasonable tax code can make filing trivial even if the situation is not.",1334641996

What if you had musicians pick one or two of their songs to be used in head to head, this or that, contests. You could have a showdown each month then release a compilation album using the winning tracks. Revenue from the album would be shared with the musicians, you could get a small cut, and it would be a cool way for people to discover new music that has been filtered by their peers. This won't make a ton of money but it could be one little piece of the puzzle down the road.<p>There was a piece on NPR a few weeks ago about a classical music company that is doing very well releasing targeted albums on iTunes. They find out what people are searching for then compile their albums and choose relevant keyworded album titles. You could use your giant musician base to pump out indie albums to iTunes and other digital music catalogs. The albums could also be crowdsorted. You research and pick an album topic and title then set up a contest, the users crowdsort relevant tracks, you compile and release the digital album.<p>I don't know how you want to interact with other platforms but you could push updates to FB and the like ""I just voted for X to be included on the upcoming album Y via Fandalism""<p>You could also make an app out of this functionality and people could listen to tracks and vote head to head or even just thumbs up or thumbs down pandora style. Everyone who was listening and voting would be sorting music for you.<p>I like to find new music but it takes a ton of effort to sort through totally unknown artists.

I feel the programme represents the best possible start for the company, the buzz of being around so many super smart people with a constant focus on delivery would help make it a success.<p>2. The programme would provide a framework for the transition we need to make from a corporate job to startup world. No matter what anyone tells you, it's extremely difficult to give a startup enough attention when you're doing it ""on-the-side"" of a big four corporate job due to the sheer number of hours (let alone the regulations). It's also very hard to leave a six-figure tax-free salary at 27 under current economic conditions without a framework for a transition.<p>I recognise that 2. is a complete excuse regardless of its merits. Given that I don't want to be sitting around at 70 wondering why I never did what I truly wanted to, I now have a lot of thinking to do about where to take this - i.e. take the plunge and self fund; minimise workload to bare minimum to find some time to work on the side; find a startup in Silicon Valley to join to move in the right direction.",1334639625

Imagine a company where you get hired with a probation period, and if you manage to automate a significant aspect of your job during that period, you get to keep it. That is, if you make yourself obsolete, you get to keep the pay. If you then do the same for another task, you get to keep the pay for the higher-paying of the two AND you get to give the lower-paying one to a person of your choice.<p>This gives you both incentive to take crappy, menial jobs as a technology expert (a robot could do that crap - no human should be so punished) and the most valuable thing of all - free time without worrying about income. And if you like automating human-degrading jobs, you can move up while giving people you care about the same thing.<p>Just an idea I'm throwing out there, it's my best answer so far for how to deal with the problem.",1334639166

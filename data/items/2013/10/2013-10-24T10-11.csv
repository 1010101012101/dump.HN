As people here have noted, anyone tech savvied does not really care yet other do. How is the website going to be used now and in the future? Is it just after sales support for example. What is the projected turnover for the company? What amount of sales will be driven by the website. Is the website part of the company image? Will the .com domain effect your company? You may also look into your countries laws and if you can claim the domain, for example due to registered trademark.<p>After you have those answers you will be in a better position to think about what I first said, the only difference is the money wanted. If the company is successful and at a later point you still want the domain, it is going to be more expensive.<p>If you want the .com and it is available then I would suggest getting it while you can.",1382612266

I have thought about it, as it is not a rational thing to &quot;hate&quot; a company and I came to the conclusion that there is a reasonable explanation:<p>This company has caused me pain time and time again, so this is the first reason I strongly dislike them.<p>That aside, this company may have had successful agreements and marketing strategies but for a range of technical people they are more of a pain and problem than a solution. They give attitude, they do not respect their users, they do not innovate, they charge for ridiculous things (eg starter, home, professional), they haven&#x27;t managed to build an os+GUI in the last 25 years!<p>You (or a lot of other people) may not agree with the above opinion.

It could plausibly mean either writing http services predominantly used by native apps or client-side browser development, which are really quite different.<p>The original question was better, I think, because it was clearly restricted to which <i>client</i> platform people are targeting.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that the ratios within purely client mobile platforms haven&#x27;t really changed that much, apart from a few new marginal entrants.

Ahead of an MRI, you additionally pay a pharmacy 20-50 euros for injections they&#x27;ll administer to you during the MRI, depending on which type of scan you&#x27;re getting (your weight), etc.  You leave with a DVD that summarizes your results and a report. I imagine the fees are subsidized by the government, but I actually don&#x27;t know if it is since it is a private clinic I&#x27;m talking about. I imagine the technicians, doctors, and assistants are likely paid less in France.",1382609031

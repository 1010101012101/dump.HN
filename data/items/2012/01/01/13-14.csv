At both ends, loads of electric current is needed. It relies on mining to bring the infrastructure, and it replaces your own information management with facilities managed by people you'll never meet and companies you'll barely know. But you have to trust them and agree to their terms, and become their customer.<p>Living in the cloud could be the most you've ever sold out without knowing it.<p>My advice: keep a few books. Bookshelves can be left in standby mode for years without needing a recharge. When people come over you can hand them a book, maybe an art book, and they will enjoy flicking through the pages. The UX of a book is top notch. Leave and rotate a few on the coffee table (if you have a coffee table, or is that in the cloud too?).",1325423322

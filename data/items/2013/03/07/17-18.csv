You probably want to pass around a pointer, anyway, so that you're not copying values over each time.<p>>  The right thing would be to use a Nullable<T> type and define a custom marshaller once and for all... but Go doesn't have generics, so you can't do that.<p>Sure you can - that's literally what the NullBool, etc. types do<p>A pointer to a string IS a 'Nullable<String>' - what they need to do is define a way to unwrap this cleanly, which is easy.",1362679117

5339036,comment,5333533,5333533,1,0,geebee,,,"This was frustrating to read, and I feel pretty bad for the candidates.  The only mitigating thing I can think of here is that it <i>does</i> cost the company money to spend so much time on interviews as well (though the cost to the candidate is typically personal, whereas interviewers themselves usually don't foot the bill from their own paychecks).<p>The thing that really rankles me (discussed in an earlier HN thread) is the ""homework"" assignment.  It sounds like they asked this guy to produce a sample video.  The reason I don't like this is that it places a large burden on the applicant with no corresponding investment of energy from the interviewer.  I've been in a similar spot where I was asked to write a sample program (the ""rule"" was to spend no more than 7 hours on it - almost a full workday).  I did this and sent it in, waited 2 months, and then finally got a call from a recruiter telling me that they had decided not to pursue me as a candidate anymore.  I can only guess that they didn't like my code, and I can guess as to why, but I'll never really know.  What I do know is that they found a way to place all the inefficiency of a long, drawn out interview process on me with no cost to themselves.<p>If they'd given me a detailed analysis of the code, I'd feel less irritated, even if I'd done it all wrong.  I understand why they might not want to do this, for legal and other reasons.  But I really do hope employers see the problem with asking for a full workday from a candidate, followed by two months of crickets chirping and a one line brush off from a recruiter.<p>I know, I know, if you really need a job, you'll put up with almost anything.  That's why this kind of thing happens.",1362678972

5338972,comment,5338576,5338576,9,0,grey-area,,,"Great post. I've done some experimentation with Go for web dev, and encountered similar problems; it's such a delight to write code in that I'd love to use it in production, but can't justify spending a lot of time debugging the immature libraries and writing new ones, particularly not on the clock for clients. I too ran into a problem with null types in another library interfacing with postgresql. The weak points I found were:<p>* Lack of an ORM (there are many, almost all incomplete, and lacking in some way)<p>* Immature or incomplete db interface libraries<p>* No db migrations (would love to see a simple sql-only solution here)<p>* Package management is simple and elegant but without explicit versioning, so forking is the end result to ensure stability<p>* No process pool management for running Go behind something like Apache or nginx.<p>This goagain tool looks interesting for the last point though:<p><a href=""https://github.com/rcrowley/goagain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rcrowley/goagain</a><p>and the routing I found pretty straightforward with something like github.com/gorilla/mux so there are solutions, they're just not always as fully baked or as mature as you'd find in other ecosystems. One place Go shines though is the great built in web server which really simplifies getting up and running and testing, and which I see they've built on here.<p>Given how easy and pleasurable it is to work with, and the focus on practicality rather than language features, I'm quite confident that Go will reach it's stated aim of becoming a popular server-side language quite soon.

5338942,comment,5338533,5338568,3,0,vabmit,,,"140: A cost benefit analysis was done and they saw a way to save money.<p>The long version from my perspective, as a former Power systems sales engineer/programmer/consultant, is that IBM's server sales division is struggling with declining sales. The source is likely virtualization and raw system capacity reducing the number of machines that the overall market needs. IBM moved xSeries (x86 machine) manufacturing/distribution to Mexico more than a decade ago, IIRC. So, this looks like a consolidation of both architectures in a single place to me.<p>Additional issues besides virt/capacity presenting themselves include not just the availability of cloud computing from companies like Amazon and Rackspace (and in house ""clouds"" like Google's x86 based white box one), but the design of start-up infrastructure (and even applications) specifically for that model. The emergence and widespread use of SaaS is similar issue.<p>The core issue with Power though, is that it's a different architecture than x86. If you really want to take advantage of the architecture you have to build your software (and all the underlying libraries and other dependencies) for that architecture. That work was often worth it when x86 chips were single core, 32bit, and workload could max out as many processors as a given system bus could support. But, now days with multi-core true 64bit x86 chips there are very few workloads where you need the Power architecture.<p>The Power is an amazing and beautiful architecture. But, even in the high end where you need the computational power it can provide it is not usually a compelling choice. For example, if you're doing large amount of complex mathematics (for physics simulations for example) there has been a trend toward using GPUs to perform the calculations due to constrained research and academic budgets. The libraries and code your simulation would run on are likely already optimized for GPU offloading. However, Power optimizations (if they were ever done in the first place) may not be kept up to date (ex: for Power4 vrs Power7) and may not be optimum or even build-able.<p>As the Power install base has declined, it's become more and more difficult to find people with the Power skill set and experience.  While Linux distributions are available and supported for Power. Power was really designed to run AIX. Finding someone with AIX, IBM build tool chain, optimization skills, and Power assembly experience is very difficult.<p>The reason I left the IBM channel in the early 2000's and took a different career path is because I saw Linux/x86 emerging. I believed that it would eventually become dominant just based off my sales win/loss history then. And, cloud (or grid computing as it was called back then) was starting to emerge.<p>I don't know if Power is ""legacy""/done for. I'm sure there are some specific use cases and applications where it still shines - like I said it's an amazing architecture. But, I think the writing is on the wall for all companies manufacturing large servers - IBM, HP, Dell. After all, there's good reason IBM has been pivoting to become a primarily services company over the last 15 years.",1362678124

There's no other magic way it can 'know' whether a particular line has been seen before. You can't rely on hash keys alone as the hashes aren't guaranteed to be unique.<p>For files with relatively few duplicates it's going to be a lot slower than sort | uniq.<p>Trying it on a 128MB file (nowhere near enough time to test a 10GB file) filled with lines of 7 random upper case characters[1] (so hardly any duplicates):-<p><pre><code>    $ wc -l x.out\n    16777216 x.out\n    \n    $ time ( sort x.out | uniq ) | wc -l\n    16759719\n\n    real    0m17.982s\n    user    0m42.575s\n    sys     0m0.876s\n    \n    $ time ( sort -u x.out ) | wc -l\n    16759719\n\n    real    0m20.582s\n    user    0m43.775s\n    sys     0m0.688s\n</code></pre>\nNot much difference between ""sort | uniq"" and ""sort -u"".<p>As for the awk method:-<p><pre><code>    $ time awk '!x[$0]++' x.out | wc -l\n    </code></pre>\nhas been running for more than 20 minutes and still hasn't returned. For that 128MB file the awk process is also using 650MB of memory (according to ps). Will check up on it later (have to go out now).<p>This Linux machine has ~16GB of memory so the file was going to be completed cached in memory before the first test. All things considered equal the awk method will be roughly O(n) (e.g. linear against file size) and sort/uniq will be O(n log n). So, theoretically, the awk method will eventually surpass the sort method because it's having to do less work (it's only checking for a previously seen key rather than sorting the entire file) but I'm not sure the crossover will be anywhere useful if the file doesn't contain many duplicates.<p>Repeating it for a file containing lots of duplicates (same 128MB file size but contents are only the 7 letter words consisting of A or B, so only 128 possible entries):-<p><pre><code>    $ time awk '!x[$0]++' y.out | wc -l\n    128\n    \n    real    0m1.207s\n    user    0m1.192s\n    sys     0m0.016s\n    \n    $ time ( sort y.out | uniq ) | wc -l\n    128\n\n    real    0m14.320s\n    user    0m31.414s\n    sys     0m0.428s\n    \n    $ time ( sort -u y.out | uniq ) | wc -l\n    128\n    \n    real    0m12.638s\n    user    0m30.366s\n    sys     0m0.188s\n</code></pre>\nNotice that ""sort -u"" doesn't do anything clever for files with lots of duplicates.<p>So awk is much faster for files with lots of duplicates. No great surprises. When I get a chance I'll repeat it for a 1GB file and a 10GB file (with lots of duplicates otherwise the awk version will take far too long).<p>1.

5338849,comment,5338576,5338576,21,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Go does not allow many basic types, such as strings or booleans, to be nil. Instead, when a type is initialized without a value, it defaults to the zero value for that type. This is frequently useful, but complicates database interactions, where null values are common.<p>This sounds like they weren't defining their types properly.<p>If your value can potentially be null, it should be a pointer to the type, not the type itself. A string can't be null, but a pointer to a string can.<p>(In fact, there's no magic going on here - 'nil' is simply the zero value of a pointer. So you always get the zero value - you just need to choose the type that has the zero value you want... which is, in this case, a pointer, not a value).<p>As explained well in this thread[0], this is the most accurate representation of the data itself. You <i>could</i> create your own type that automatically decodes all null values to whatever the zero value is (empty string, etc)., but then you lose that information.<p>Yes, this forces you to do a check for the null value before using the data for the first time (or to invent your own monad for abstracting this), but at a high level, that's what you have to do in <i>every</i> language.<p>[0] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/golang-nuts/JOFWAqrTbUs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/golang-nu...</a>",1362677360

It was simpler (not saying better, just simpler) to V2.5 or later supports this<p>On a related note, a few years ago I went from assigning version numbers to the releases of some of my projects to simple date-based versions (e.g., ""version 20130307""). One of the reasons I switched to using dates is that beyond v1.0 it's often hard to assign versions to software in a meaningful fashion (is our next release a ""v3.0"" or a ""v2.1""?); that is especially true if your software isn't of the commercial variety where a major version increase hinges on the question of ""is this substantially different to charge an upgrade fee of $N for?"". One exception to this naming rule is that I assign low numerical versions (e.g., ""v0.03"") to early code to indicate its quality.<p>What would you say about this practice vs. build numbers or traditional version numbers?<p>Edit: To clarify, I don't think this alone constitutes going rolling release.<p>Overall, I found it pleasant to not have to think about version numbering. Release dates also seem to be easier to remember and interpret than mere build numbers (a half-forgotten date like ""201207..."" is easier to pin down than ""build 12573... something"")",1362677341

I'd certainly believe the equation is very different in their eyes now (different in the sense of the consequences, China has a lot more to lose these days having come so far).<p>Before North Korea had a nuclear weapon, much less the ability to build numerous of them, China propped up North Korea in countless ways for decades (from food to weapons to moral support). China could have very trivially killed Kim (or requested his overthrow), with absolutely no consequences. It's not like the weak and vastly smaller North Korean army was going to invade China, particularly after the Kims were gone.<p>I believe China could still dismantle North Korea.

5338780,comment,5338129,5338129,3,0,jules,,,"> Even if Sauron can cause Mt. Doom to erupt immediately, we know from the actual story that the eagles are capable of navigating into Mordor and locating and rescuing Frodo and Sam, despite the major eruption which was taking place. Even if Sauron did manage to catch the eagles in the eruption, however, could this melt the Ring? If Sauron does manage to figure out that the eagles are carrying the Ringbearer, he might opt not to cause Mt. Doom to erupt, just for this very reason.<p>This suggests a far better option: Sauron could have cooled down mount doom, and then when the eagles arrived there would be nothing they could do to destroy the ring. Meanwhile a massive army from all over Mordor would be building up around them, and the Nazgul would be on their way to capture the ring before they could get out of Mordor. Of course this does not counter the argument that the option was not even discussed.",1362676685

And you can decide how you want to handle it, instead of necessarily throwing a type error. Plus, polymorphic functions allow you to handle different types with the same function instead of having to overload it. And the test suite lets you run tests like (is (instance? Bar foo)) to help you catch type errors before you push to production.<p>So, what I mean is, although giving up the type-checking compiler opens up the possibility of introducing runtime type errors in production, it's far from a given that they are going to happen, because dynamic languages give you plenty of other tools to prevent them.<p>And Java's type system is onerous because it gives you all of the rigidity of static typing but none of the power of type inference.

The risk of having someone ""steal"" your idea (in the very loose definition) and beat you to the publication, for instance by having a bigger research team, thus putting you out of a job, is a real one.<p>In an ideal world your system would be perfect, putting the advancement of knowledge before everything else (as open source does with software), but researchers have to look out for themselves before all, considering how their performance is evaluated and how that affects their livelihood.

I realize that income performance is correlated to the industry it's in and hence correlated with stocks in the same industry. That's the whole basis for the discussion and I see that. Jesus!<p>I see that, and I still disagree.<p>This is where both approaches can be right and this is the whole point I have been trying to make. For the sake of argument, suppose you have a trillion dollars in the bank and therefore infinite risk tolerance. Suppose also that your income is 100k. At this point, temporary loss of your income, which can also be reduced by unemployment pay, is wholly inconsequential compared to maximizing your gains in the stock market. If the tech sector pays back at 20% y/y (average) and the next best sector only pays back 5%, absolutely it's better to be in the tech sector even though your income comes from that. My example is unrealistic, but it serves a point: mathematically, it works. So the question is then how much risk (i.e. volatility) can you take in pursuit of maximizing returns? If you have a lot of assets, plenty. If you have no assets and therefore no risk tolerance, obviously diversifying your income from your investments is a good idea. But crucially, whether or not same-sector income/investment is a good idea all depends on how much risk (i.e. volatility) you can take.<p>Would you suggest Steve Jobs shouldn't have held Apple stock?

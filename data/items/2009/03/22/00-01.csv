Furthermore it wouldn't be terribly difficult to do early on. You don't need too much metallurgy to cast type, and the rest of a basic letterpress could be made of wood. Paper isn't too hard to make. Neither are batteries, so as soon as you can produce wire efficiently you can set up a telegraph.

Right now I'm typing this on a computer that was made by people I've never met in a number of different countries that I've never visited; structures like international trade agreements and currency exchange mechanisms make it possible for us to have a mutually beneficial economic relationship.  (Size of cooperative unit makes a pretty good benchmark of progress, extending past 1900 to the present.)<p>If technology disappeared, our social and economic organizations would suddenly extend no further than the tribal level, i.e. the number of people we could have cooperative relationships with would be limited to the people we saw in person on a daily basis.<p>Even assuming we still had the necessary schematics to understand what we were trying to build, it would take a long time for us to get sufficiently well-organized to manufacture it in quantity. Of course, it's possible that in this starting-over scenario, technological progress would outpace the rebuilding of social organization, to the point where we'd have all the same electronic goods, for instance, but each region would make its own. Or maybe we'd have to duplicate the transportation-technology revolution of the early and mid-20th century before we could get anywhere with the communications-technology revolution of the last 20+ years.",1237683075

I get most of my work off of Craigslist's computer gigs section, but I'm finding it increasingly difficult, and I don't think it's just a matter of economic conditions.<p>Sites like Craigslist, Rentacoder and Elance are flooded with posts offering unreasonably low pay, as well as responses from offshore sweatshops that produce exceedingly bad code[0]. Posters have taken to hiding ""put foo in the subject so I don't have to read spam"" on Craigslist due to the overwhelming response to ANY ad. I think there might be room for something a little more exclusive.<p>My initial concept for this is that hackers would be screened for membership. It wouldn't be a high bar - a link to a HN account associated with a few sensible comments, a blog, a github account or similar would be enough to establish credibility. The site would also be policed a little more as far as postings go. One idea is to use a flagging system that can cause posts to be moved, and to have sections like ""work for equity"" and ""work for pay"".<p>[0] An example from an actual project I fixed after it was initially created by such a sweatshop can be seen here: http://paste.lisp.org/display/76132",1237682604

They're consummately professional, know their product and category inside and out, and are eager to educate people on the ins and outs of credit card processing. I had heard at one point that they had a higher rate for services billing less than $1MM a year, but I've since heard that that doesn't apply to SaaS companies that are using Rails (I'm not sure what the definitive answer is on this; I know they were the best price we could find, and I looked extensively).<p>For recurring billing, we use a Rails-based billing framework called Freemium (<a href=""http://github.com/cainlevy/freemium/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/cainlevy/freemium/tree/master</a>), and have been very happy with it. It integrates with Braintree flawlessly.

We hired him, and couldn't be happier with his work.<p>One thing to keep in mind when you're looking for a payment processor is this: How transparent are they with their costs? Do they complicate their fee structure with hidden costs? Credit card billing can be a really complex beast, and having a partner who's interested in helping you make sense of it is very valuable. That's what we found in Braintree. I'm sure there are others that are good, but I'm glad I haven't had to look for them, and that I've been able to just focus on building my business.",1237681640

526811,comment,526334,526334,0,0,mpk,,,"Well, experience goes a long way.<p>After having built software in different languages for different targets on different systems a few times, you start recognizing patterns.<p>One of the strategies I use to become comfortable with new environments is to build a piece of software (usually a prototype) using only the core language, standard library and maybe one or two 'mature' pieces of third-party library code.<p>This takes a bit of time and I usually end up with a codebase that is a bit crufty (especially when I'm learning the language as I go). However, this usually gets me to the prototype stage with a lot of newly acquired knowledge about performance of the language, best-practices, etc. As well as a lot of testing code.<p>After that I'll start looking into third-party libraries and start factoring out my own code with third-party libs where appropriate.<p>For Java, for example, I've found that a lot of the language helper/util code I write can be replaced with code from org.apache.commons.<p>For interacting with crufty stuff like webservices in all their non-standard glory, I usually build a few classes in Ruby with breakpoints so I can interactively analyze and poke at them. Much, much faster than going through the 'change code'-save-recompile-run cycle with breakpoints in C# and Java.<p>When dealing with loads of XML config files, I'll quickly do a git init and also keep all the files open in vim buffers. (Vim and Emacs are excellent tools for working your way through XML junk). Then I'll put print (or equivalent) statements in the code so I can run the app from the command line and filter the output through grep or even some custom scripts that'll filter the output for me and provide some basic analysis or correlation points.<p>The list goes on and on.<p>You have to realize that apart from the code that operates solely within your codebase (and not even then), you are always dealing with third-party code. The OS, compiler, the VM, the windowing routines, the threading model, etc.<p>As you go on you have to learn techniques to handle this. And one of the first things you already seem to have learned is that you should never be quick to voluntarily add to the pile of third-party software you're already dealing with.<p>And that 10x programmer working opposite you who generates mod_rewrite configs like there's no tomorrow? Yeah, that person spent about 3 days getting to the bottom of that engine and testing the hell out of various configs a few years ago. There's not much of a short-cut for these kind of things.",1237681530

I've never really made any progress: coming up with good answers requires a lot of cross-discipline knowledge that I just can't bother to track down in my spare time. Geology, chemistry, materials engineering, mechanics/industrial design etc, etc. It stands to reason that all the science and engineering disciplines would be involved.<p>Machine tools are the foundation of just about everything, but there's a lot more to do once you can produce and shape metal. Chemical production is a big task once you have the handling of basic materials out of the way, and energy is important right from the start (electricity!). You'd have to have easy access to clean, and hot water to maintain good hygiene and a decent standard of living, which is important for morale. Which questions do we consider - just the technology part, or the kinds of social precautions you would have to take? A struggle for resources causes all sorts of difficulties. How would the economy work? There's no way to maintain governments like those we have today when there are no means for fast communication.<p>What is the easiest way to bootstrap technology from scratch? It would probably be a lot easier in temperate climates where food is abundant; in many parts of the world too much effort would have to be spent on just staying alive. The focus would have to be on tools right from the start: gather resources to build stuff and then use your new gear to build more stuff. Even if everybody knew exactly where we were going, it would take decades at the minimum. There is just so much to do, and so much of our technology depend on things we have developed already.<p>We could write books about this stuff. You could probably dedicate whole academic careers to the question, especially if you really want to try out the practical aspect.

7948807,comment,7940766,7941656,2,0,tripzilch,,,"> Considering the work needed by the website to convince the user to give away the data, and even with approaches like described with the article, we may be overestimating what websites could learn of us by checking if we&#x27;ve visited some random 2, or 4, or 15 sites.<p>It&#x27;s true, history hacks were a lot more &quot;fun&quot; when you could still check 10-100s of URLs per second without any user interaction necessary.<p>You could pull off some very cool and unexpected tricks by applying such knowledge in a clever manner. The important thing to realize is that what you can use history information for goes way beyond &quot;I know where you surfed last summer&quot;. That&#x27;s just a mild privacy problem.<p>Targeting specific end-points, profile pages, stuff like that, you can leak a lot more interesting information than just someone&#x27;s browsing habits. Right up to the point where you could (for certain services, under certain circumstances) cook up someone&#x27;s session key and it suddenly became an actual security exploit.<p>Still, a couple of those tricks (or perhaps new ones) might still be worth it even if you can only query 10-20 sites. I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s not a lot of information. Though 33 bits is enough to identify any human on Earth.<p>> you need to make the user somehow disclose what he sees on the screen, which may often look suspicious.<p>Well that&#x27;s the thing what this article is about, right? How it works is, there is a 32x32 grid of &quot;close&quot;-buttons. But you only see one of them, all the others are CSS hidden. That one you click. By virtue of which button it was, the site now knows 10 history-visited-states.<p>As the article says, if that looked like a &quot;close&quot;-button on a pop-up ad, where&#x27;s the suspicion?<p>I use an adblocker. I get a popup, it has nothing but a &quot;close&quot;-button in it. I figure, &quot;guess it only blocked part of the ad or something&quot; and click the &quot;close&quot;-button without even thinking. The pop-up closes, and I&#x27;ve already forgotten that it happened.<p>The only suspicion I see could be that the &quot;close&quot;-button might appear in a weird, off-centre place. But that matches perfectly with the wonky-adblocker-behaviour theory in my head, so I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about it.",1403776757

7948798,comment,7944772,7946088,3,0,72deluxe,,,"I too find the flat snow-blindness white landscape difficult to navigate, and the removal of buttons looking like buttons means you have to blindly stab over the device at words to discover if they&#x27;re buttons. I turned on the &quot;make buttons look like buttons&quot; option in Accessibility and they just look like early-90s hyperlinks instead. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they added a blinking scrolling marquee to complete the effect, and perhaps an animated rainbow-coloured horizontal ruler haha. I look like an idiot when attempting to use my iPad, sort of like those annoying types who double-click links on web pages (let&#x27;s send two GET requests!)<p>I can only imagine how my mum gets on with it. The removal of buttons to do things is another thing - how the heck do you remove a bookmark in Safari on iOS? Ah yes, swipe sideways of course. This took me hours to discover. I am all for simplicity, but not for removal of hints/controls.<p>The Calendar application on OSX is now a big white blob. I could just stick a piece of blank A4 paper to my screen and get the same effect.<p>It distresses me, as you can tell. I shouldn&#x27;t be squinting when using an application on a computer, or fumbling around with an iPad like it&#x27;s a children&#x27;s noisy toy or toy phone / etch-a-sketch.

7948752,comment,7934548,7935909,2,0,koffiezet,,,"> I think it is rather embarrassing that most code written in modern languages performs worse on today&#x27;s computers than native code running on 1980s machines.<p>Ok, let&#x27;s play ball.<p>> After the Cray-1, the Cray Corporation developed another giant named Cray-2. It remained the world’s fastest Supercomputer between the years 1985 to 1989, capable of performing 1.9 gigaflops.\n( Source: <a href=""http://infotology.blogspot.be/2012/04/super-computer-timeline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infotology.blogspot.be/2012/04/super-computer-timelin...</a> )<p>So that&#x27;s tha fastest of the fast in the &#x27;80&#x27;s. According to Intel, a i7-3770k consumer CPU gets 112 gflops and a Q6600 quad core, which was released in Q1 2007, has 38.40 GFlops. That&#x27;s a factor 58+ faster on the i7, or a factor 20 for the Q6600.<p>Now let&#x27;s take the Q6600 to make it easy to compare languages in a very bad way: <a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all&data=u32q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32q/benchmark.php?t...</a><p>I picked the bench config x86 quad core because this had the highest peak. Also, if you take these languages, which are more commonly used:\n* C#/Mono: Worst 9x, median 2x\n* Go: Worst 7x, median 3x\n* Haskell: Worst 3x, median 2x\n* Java: Worst 3x, median 2x\n* PHP: Worst 109x, median 36x\n* Python 3: Worst 129x, median 37x \n* Ruby: Worst 239x, median 53x\n* JRuby: Worst 115x, median 34x<p>But keep in mind that:\n* Current CPU integer performance, cache speeds, memory bandwidth and general i/o would completely destroy the Cray-2\n* GFlops are a real bad indicator of how fast a computer is. Current computers are even faster. Current GPU&#x27;s are floating point optimized and run circles around any general purpose CPU when it comes to GFlops.\n* These are CPU-bound artificial language comparison benchmarks.\n* Native code means nothing. Bad slow code will always be slow, whatever language you use. Some of the languages included do compile to &#x27;native code&#x27; (Go and Haskell), and a lot of the interpreted/byte code compiled languages use a JIT to generate &#x27;native code&#x27; too.\n* We don&#x27;t take into account the Cray-2&#x27;s bottlenecks (mainly I/O)\n* All GFlop numbers are according to the manufacturer.\n* Most applications hit i/o limits before hitting CPU limits (yes there are exceptions)\n* this is comparing with the fastest of the fast you could get at the end of the &#x27;80s<p>So in worst theoretical cases, sure. In the real world? Not even close.",1403775688

7948731,comment,7942031,7942031,2,0,Ghalib5423,,,"In the 1960s, the Government of Pakistan tried to make naskh common in order to facilitate mechanization of printing.  In order to do so, naskh was introduced in schools so that children get used to it from an early age.  Some books started appearing in naskh.  The daily newspaper Nawa-i-waqt started printing its second page in naskh. It was very unfortunate for Urdu that these efforts failed.  The reason was simple.  Instead of requiring that the textbooks be typeset in naskh, they continued to be handwritten, albeit in naskh-like script.  Gradually after a few years that naskh started resembling nasta’aliq more and more and eventually all traces of naskh disappeared. This, to mind, was the greatest setback suffered by the Urdu language printing.<p>Let me explain why I call it the greatest setback.  Urdu books and newspapers were written by hand and then lithographed.  The process was slow, mistakes were plentiful, dots above and below letters were misplaced, letters such as daal and waaw were indistinct from each other, and many times the printing was illegible.  Please try to read a book produced by that method, and then compare it to the same book typeset in naskh; you will note the difference. I have a copy of Divan-e-Hafiz published in nasta’aliq in the subcontinent, and another copy in naskh published in Iran.  The difference in the clarity of text in the two is phenomenal.<p>This abortive attempt in 1960s to switch to naskh had nothing to do with religion or Arabization.  Ayub Khan, in whose time the effort started, can hardly be accused of religion-inspired initiatives. It was simply to promote mechanized printing.  If anything, later the religion-enthusiast Zia-ul-Haq did nothing to popularize naskh.\nIronically, computer has saved nasta’aliq, since software is now commonly available which is now universally used to compose material for printing. But naskh is still clearer to read, and in my opinion it is not too late to give it another try, and use naskh, while reserving nasta’aliq for calligraphy.  Undoubtedly nasta’aliq is elegant and no script can match its beauty.",1403774935

This is much better.<p>I&#x27;m now off to read &quot;cmdline.txt&quot; (:help Command-line).<p>BTW, I just accidentally closed my browser tab (latest version of Firefox) by hitting Ctrl-W when I wanted to delete the previous word in this textbox. That used to drive me mad but when Firefox restored the tab, it also restored the text I&#x27;d typed. :)",1403773434

It&#x27;s been requested since day one, and would have kept the hardcore folks busy until community warfare.<p>- Learn the art of tweaking game balance. They drop patches every two weeks. Instead of making huge, sometimes game wrecking, balance changes every three months they could have nudged the balance slightly each patch. &quot;Missiles seem slightly too easy to avoid - making them 3% faster&quot; doesn&#x27;t make anyone blow a gasket. &quot;Bumping missile speed 75%&quot; will.",1403773219

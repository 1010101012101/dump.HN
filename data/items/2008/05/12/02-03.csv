187218,comment,187129,187129,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Of course, at this time the housing bubble is still deflating, so this kind of calculation heavily favors renters in many areas.<p>The guy at Shadenfreude Central, a.k.a. www.irvinehousingblog.com, recommends computing the ratio of a house's sale price to the monthly rent for an equivalent house. The charts on this page:<p><a href=""http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/blog/comments/wot-3-22-2008/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/blog/comments/wot-3-22-2008...</a><p>assert that the national historic norm for this number is about 180: i.e. a house that rents for $3k should cost about  $3k x 180 = $540k. As a rule of thumb, if the sales price is significantly more than this calculation would suggest, it's a good time to rent instead of buying.<p>Having said all that: The reason to buy a house was well articulated by Christopher Alexander in <i>A Pattern Language</i> (which, as all pattern-wielding Java programmers should know by now, is a classic):<p><i>Pattern 79. YOUR OWN HOME<p>People cannot be genuinely comfortable and healthy in a house which is not theirs. All forms of rental - whether from private landlords or public housing agencies - work against the natural processes which allow people to form stable, self-healing communities...<p>This pattern is not intended as an argument in favor of ""private property,"" or the process of buying and selling land. Indeed, it is very clear that all those processes which encourage speculation in land, for the sake of profit, are unhealthy and destructive, because they invite people to treat houses as commodities, to build things for ""resale,"" and not in such a way as to fit their own needs.<p>And just as speculation and the profit motive make it impossible for people to adapt their houses to their own needs, so tenancy, rental, and landlords do the same. Rental areas are always the first to turn to slums. The mechanism is clear and well known. See, for example, George Sternlieb, The Tenement Landlord(Rutgers University Press, 1966). The landlord tries to keep his maintenance and repair costs as low as possible; the residents have no incentive to maintain and repair the homes - in fact, the opposite - since improvements add to the wealth of the landlord, and even justify higher rent. And so the typical piece of rental property degenerates over the years. Then landlords try to build new rental properties which are immune to neglect - gardens are replaced with concrete, carpets are replaced with lineoleum, and wooden surfaces by formica: it is an attempt to make the new units maintenance-free, and to stop the slums by force; but they turn out cold and sterile and again turn into slums, because nobody loves them.<p>People will only be able to feel comfortable in their houses, if they can change their houses to suit themselves, add on whatever they need, rearrange the garden as they like it; and, of course, they can only do this in circumstances where they are the legal owners of the house and land; and if, in high density multi-story housing, each apartment, like a house, has a welldefined volume, in which the owner can make changes as he likes.</i>",1210559812

Plus, data in aggregate is far more useful than data in isolation. Google knows what ads people with a similar search history have actually clicked on, and they can use that information to target ads at you. Google can rebuild most of the useful data from your Facebook profile (what kinds of books, movies, activities, etc. that you're interested in), and they also know what you're interested in <i>right this moment</i>. That is very valuable.<p>I didn't know that they don't actually use historical search data, but they have the data and it can be used in the future. I don't see how using past searches to target ads is so different from using current searches.",1210559344

187199,comment,187133,187133,0,0,DenisM,,,"Subsequent allocation of funds can be friction-free after ""account"" is setup at particular VC fund. I have heard it someone agreed with their VC on a schedule where money flows one way and shares flow the other way. They have bailed half-way too, since they were doing well enough.<p>Of course now that you are holding an extra advantage over VCs they will expect higher compensation for their disadvantage, if they know what's good for them.<p>.<p>Now, if you were asking for infinitely elastic fund, that presents a bigger problem. When you buy things from AWS they know the value of what they get in return - dollars. When you ask for dollars and provide equity in exchange the other party does not know what the value of your proposition is. To assign value requires a lot of labor.<p>What would work here is some sort of automatic way to establish value of stock. For large companies there exists one. it's called stock marker and its very elastic - you can keep issuing shares as long as you want, until your balance sheet starts looking bad for all the cash you are sitting on (or squandering). Stock markets price the equity based on SEC reports, news and analysts opinions. All of these things cost money and only make sense when such cost can be amortized over large pool of shares.<p>If the value of shares issued is identical to cost of valuation process the whole thing is wash.<p>So for this idea to work at minimum process of valuation needs to be (a lot) less expensive than the total stock price itself. Additionally, several VC funds would have to share the cost somehow.<p>Normally valuation is quite expensive, but if you do it every month maybe it could be less so. In essence, VCs already kind of do it for the companies they invested into.  The only problem is that they will not share this information with others.<p>There is opportunity in here somewhere.",1210557706

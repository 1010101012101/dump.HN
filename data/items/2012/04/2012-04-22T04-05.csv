Population density (and mix) along with food culture and infrastructure conspire to create multicultural food meccas. I'd probably rate Thai food #2 or #3 in Bangkok, with Japanese, Chinese or maybe Italian having an edge. Hong Kong is marginally more expensive than Bangkok but both offer excellent value. They've also both developed strong wine and beer cultures. I've been enjoying a wide variety of high value Bordeaux here in Bangkok. Both have growing supplies of Belgian and German beers as well.

3874007,comment,3873698,3873698,8,0,otterley,,,"Classic red herring piece.  The author argues that the middle class struggle to live well in the most temperate parts of the state because property values are too expensive, then goes off on a tangent about wasteful Government spending that has absolutely nothing to do with the problem -- other than perhaps adding to the income tax burden, even though state income tax rates are 1/3rd of our Federal tax rates.<p>Property values aren't set by the Government; they're driven by -- surprise -- supply and demand.  There's only so much land in the nicest parts of the state, and since the residents of those areas control zoning ordinances through their local governments, they have every incentive to restrict supply as much as they can to protect their own property values -- typically under the guise of ""protecting neighborhoods"" from those who would build more dense housing.<p>Proposition 13 (1978) was also a big win for incumbent homeowners.  It forces property tax assessments to be based on the initial purchase price, regardless of the current actual value.  This incents longtime residents to hold on to their homes, even if a smaller home (or a home otherwise more convenient to them) would better suit them in the present, because moving could result in significantly higher property taxes.  This starves the housing market of liquidity and also restricts supply.<p>TL;DR: Property owners' selfishness, codified into State and local law, is the real cause of middle class misery in California.",1335070071

I feel like I can't even tell what info is right when it comes to this stuff.<p>----<p>Okay, so I'm a US citizen. If I understand you right, most of my problems stem from wanting to incorporate in Singapore. If I incorporate domestically but run it while traveling, that'll cover most bases and make life much easier, correct?<p>Secondly, I don't doubt your talk about the complexity added on by incorporating in Singapore. But Singapore is really banking on people starting to incorporate there, I mean there must be some sort of national effort to automate/lessen the hurdles, right? I mean your random comment literally saved me from thinking that incorporating in SG/HK would be a good option.<p>I don't know, just after reading sivers.org I just assumed that the complexity was much more manageable. Maybe I'm just gullible/easily misled? Or does this option only make sense when you have a certain number of people working with you/certain profit? Could you guess as to what those numbers might be?<p>If I did want to incorporate, is there a big difference between incorporating in HK/SG/better place I don't know of?",1335068903

This is typically caused by an email address compromise and something you will deal with directly with the email provider (be sure to request logs of recent access to your email account ASAP, this will help later). Also, change your account password on this account immediately and scan your local machine for malware.<p>2) The more pressing issue for you though is retrieval of your domain. Luckily ICANN has a very specific process on how to handle this, and it's mainly up to your registrar to handle for you. So contacting your registrar is in more cases all you need to do (remember, this isn't a basic support inquiry though, so you may need to wait for the fraud/abuse staff, depending on the registrar.)<p>You can review the specific process the registrar should be following here: <a href=""http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/tdrp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/tdrp</a> it's the official 'transfer dispute resolution policy'. I have handled these at the registrar level and 95% of the time it goes smoothly as long as the facts are laid out for all parties. Information such as the IP who accessed your email account at the time of the reg. transfer is one of the key pieces of evidence you can provide your registrar to make the transfer dispute go faster, however your registrar is likely (obligated under due diligence) to have their own records of the transferrers IP who approved the request.<p>I wish you the best of luck, I can't really help out specifically with your case but if you have any questions about the TDRP procedure feel free to ask.<p>P.S. ""Step 3"" would be to address any losses, if you want to seek this option out you will need to lawyer up as any damages claimed would have to be recovered in a civil dispute (this is presuming you are presiding under US law/courts)",1335067694

Sorry but it is utterly normal for a state that is getting more populous and more crowded every year to have out migration.<p>So perhaps if taken in a very limited interpretation the statistics they made in the article are correct, but if you use that same limited interpretation those statistics do not support any of the later conclusions or, more accurately, ravings of the article. Thus, the article is still misleading, or basically lying with statistics.",1335067660

If you have a workload that is light on CPU but needier on RAM, m4.large is cheaper than m3.large; m3.medium may not do as it has less than 4GB.<p>Also, in our experience t2.* instances can&#x27;t sustain any reasonable network traffic, but they do work wonderfully for lightweight RESTful systems. So any workload which serves mostly cached data and needs 6-7 GB per node is best off with m4.large. At least for Ireland, in our experience a single m4.large can keep up with bursts of ~120Mbps and sustain around 65Mbps. We have two as edge nodes for one of our public services, and will probably add a third one soon. Cutoff point for sustained bandwidth is slightly above 70Mbps, after that it starts to stutter. The t2.* instances choke and throttle bandwidth way earlier.<p>Finding the right instance type for a particular service always takes some time and experimentation.",1452061776

Would you live in a Big Brother type house where everything you do is recorded and shown to the public? That includes you showing, shitting, picking your nose, having sex, watching porn, every conversation you have etc.<p>And maybe you really don&#x27;t give a fuck about that. I guess some people could stand naked in front of a crowd and shit themselves an not think twice about it.<p>But then on the other hand, there is one more thing to consider. What if the current government, or another one elected in the next 5 to 20 years is really evil? And let&#x27;s say they are against the things you believe in, and they believe anyone who believes what you believe should suffer unimaginably? Or what if you like to complain about things? You post negative restaurant reviews Write angry letters in the newspaper, stuff like that. And this new government doesn&#x27;t like complainers, because they don&#x27;t want to be challenged. They could just look at all the stuff you have complained about in the past and decide you are too dangerous. So they arrest you (and your family, because why not?) and then they put you in a concentration camp. Where you and your family are worked to death. Starved to death. Beaten to death. Raped. Experimented on. Burned alive.<p>I know it&#x27;s an extreme example, but things like this have happened before. Except now it&#x27;s easier than ever for governments to round up the people they don&#x27;t like, and to find out who the people they don&#x27;t like are. And the less you care about privacy, the easier you make it for them.<p>Would you still say you don&#x27;t care about privacy?

How can one be certain in a Kantian/Popper framework where statements can be proved false but never true?<p>3a) Here is where we part ways.  It is a common assumption that AI implies consciousness but I think that is an unwarranted assumption.  Whatever the principles behind intelligence are, we know that consciousness minds have found a way to (implicitly) enact them. It does not follow that consciousness is necessary for intelligence (just the <i>biological</i> manifestation of them) and I think good arguments exist to think that they are not correlatives. If they are correlatives then it will be easier to genetically design better babies, now that evolution is in conscious control, than to start from scratch.<p>3b) Goals, values, aims, etc. are teleological concepts that apply to living things only because they face the alternative of life or death.  Turning off your computer does not kill it in the same sense that a living thing that stops functioning dies forever. 3a) & 3b) diffuses all the scary AI scenarios about AI taking over the world. It does raise the issue of AI in the hands of bad people with evil goals and values, like the dictator of North Korea who now apparently has the H-Bomb. This is the real danger today.<p>4) I agree.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 49,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 85 (37 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.  Right now we’re looking for engineering leaders: people who can help us see around corners as we build new products, and who are passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs</a>, or check out our recent press here:\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-third-of-schools-are-using-this-app-youve-never-heard-of"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-thir...</a>",1452060499

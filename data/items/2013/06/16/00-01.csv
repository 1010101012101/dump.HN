5886895,comment,5886686,5886844,36,0,burntsushi,,,"> most of the people commenting on the NSA story on HN say things that make it clear that they believe NSA continues to have the direct access to Google&#x27;s systems<p>You&#x27;re mincing words. Your comments clearly indicate that you think &quot;direct access&quot; unambiguously means &quot;access to servers that run GMail that the NSA can snoop on any time they like.&quot; But from what I&#x27;ve seen, most comments on HN adopt and acknowledge a more ambiguous definition.<p>The one you propose is the extreme. But other definitions include an interface for the NSA to request data and have it deposited in some &quot;drop box&quot; that can then be accessed by the NSA (all <i>without</i> a warrant). It&#x27;s reasonable to call this &quot;direct access&quot;, particularly if the audience is not tech savvy. (Which is something we don&#x27;t know.)<p>Moreover, most folks here seem painfully aware that &quot;direct access&quot; really hasn&#x27;t been qualified. It seems reasonable your definition isn&#x27;t really true, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the Guardian&#x27;s reporting is incorrect. (The Guardian never put forward a precise definition---either because they didn&#x27;t have one or were unwilling to release it.)<p>Personally, I think you are attributing way too much certainty to the HN crowd.",1371344203

We need to close 9 out of 10 military bases around the world, perhaps more. End Homeland Security and the TSA. Strictly enforce privacy laws, including the 4th amendment, such that anybody in the government that violates them does hard prison time. Cut the espionage budget ($80+ billion) substantially, including all of the budget allocated to illegal domestic spying. Pass new restrictions on the ability of the executive branch to wage undeclared war (ie without congressional approval), both in the style of what we&#x27;re doing now in Syria and the more traditional war in Iraq. We should also simplify the tax code, simultaneously wiping out a lot of tax fraud by ending 99% of all loopholes and deductions, and slashing the IRS in half, saving tens of billions per year in tax compliance costs.<p>We should also, obviously, end the failed war on drugs, and end the mass prison system. The policy of holding in prison millions of political prisoners should be immediately stopped, bringing the extremely violent &#x27;war on drugs&#x27; assault on liberty by the government from 1980 until now, to an end. This war of power and greed, costs hundreds of billions of dollars per year in government expenditures, lost lives, lost productivity, prison costs, and the destroyed futures of those held captive as political prisoners (many to be enslaved for labor in corporate prisoners). Not to mention the tens of thousands of lives it ends around the world every year. We currently spend over $100 billion just to keep 2.2 million people in prison.<p>Your conclusion at the end presents a false choice.

Nadler&#x27;s disclosure that NSA analysts can listen to calls without \n    court orders came during a House Judiciary hearing on Thursday that included \n    FBI director Robert Mueller as a witness.\n        \n    Mueller initially sought to downplay concerns about NSA surveillance by \n    claiming that, to listen to a phone call, the government would need to seek &quot;a \n    special, a particularized order from the FISA court directed at that particular \n    phone of that particular individual.&quot;\n        \n    Is information about that procedure &quot;classified in any way?&quot; Nadler asked.\n        \n    &quot;I don&#x27;t think so,&quot; Mueller replied.\n        \n    &quot;Then I can say the following,&quot; Nadler said. &quot;We heard precisely the \n    opposite at the briefing the other day. We heard precisely that you could get \n    the specific information from that telephone simply based on an analyst \n    deciding that...In other words, what you just said is incorrect.

With no skill, they are allowed out on the road, often with just a parents supervision, or sometimes under the supervision of a driving instructor, who usually has both their own backup brake pedal, and the ability to grab the wheel. Google, Continental, Audi and all the other companies who are testing on the road also work this way. The software drives, but a safety driver is sitting in the drivers seat, carefully watching and ready to use the brakes or wheel if there is a problem. I think its not unreasonable to claim that the latest robocar prototypes are as safe as a teen taking the first try at the wheel, and this driving instructor approach might be a better way to look at vehicle testing.

People escaping the park were shelled by tear gas and plastic bullets and followed, sometimes dragged at the ground and beaten before arrest. A portion of the crowd escaped to Divan Hotel, which was in turn currently under siege by police throwing tear gas through the broken windows. Anybody trying to get out of the hotel is attacked, beaten and arrested on spot. There are children trapped inside.<p>The police started to stain pressurised water with chemical, which causes burns on contact.[1] The gas mixture used in today&#x27;s tear gas shells cause facial bleeding.[2]<p>The doctors trying to set up triage spots and infirmaries are stopped as per orders of Ministry of Health, which decreed today all the doctors that triaged protesters on field will be investigated. There are reports of doctors getting arrested for helping protesters. [3]<p>The major vehicular traffic arteries are blocked by police barricades, the sea lines cancelled, and major walkways under police assault. There are jammers in the affected areas. The news crew and journalists are barred from the areas and police are stopping those who try to take footage or photos.<p>There are reports of a large group of people moving towards the Taksim area in response, towards E-5, the major traffic artery, intending to cross the Bosphorus over the vehicleonly bridge.<p>The Co-head of Germany&#x27;s Greens Party, Claudia Roth is currently trapped under shell fire in Divan Hotel.<p>In other words.

In Syria, something like 90,000 people have died fighting an authoritarian regime, with no end in sight.  In Iran, people won&#x27;t even vote in the election (where voting is compulsory) because they know that the elections are rigged.  On the other side of the coin, in the UK, you&#x27;re subject to government surveillance in every public space.  It&#x27;s a trade-off, and the choices aren&#x27;t as clear as you might believe if you limited your knowledge to what you read on Reddit and HN.<p>My point is that you have to be pretty cynical to suggest that the USA -- where we let the Occupy protesters linger in front of federal buildings until they were nothing but <i>de facto</i> homeless encampments -- has been on an endlessly downward slippery slope.  We live in one of the most free and privileged countries on earth, and it&#x27;s important to keep a sense of perspective on these things.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily like that the NSA is tracking phone calls, but I&#x27;m also keenly aware of the fact that they aren&#x27;t dragging people out of their homes in the middle of the night, and that we don&#x27;t have cars exploding daily in New York City.

[…] “I just talked to a tech Web site here in Germany, they have seven employees and 40 percent of their users have ad-blockers,” he said. “There was a tech convention in America, and they couldn’t afford to send more than one journalist because so many of their ads are being blocked.”</i><p>So? The very concept of ads is flawed. There are two things consumers want: a) discovery, b) reviews. Both are best served by independent parties, filters, “editors”, gatekeepers who earn the trust of consumers by doing, guess what, good introductions and good reviews. Sometimes, consumers take it upon themselves to spread the word or write good reviews. Other times, consumers should pay for these things. And producers should concentrate on making good products. Advertising is conscious, paid-for, explicit manipulation of other people. Why is it so hard for some people to not whitewash it and see it for what it is?",1325497761

3415364,comment,3414977,3415213,0,0,dantheman,,,"A have a few points to make :)<p>First, I was arguing that the ""copycatting"" could be considered ""normal science"", where we have scientists finding a technique that works and trying to learn as much as they can, for example breeding fruit flies.  I quote copycatting before because each entrepreneur has different ideas about 1. the problem 2. the market 3. the technical approach, etc and could perhaps be seen as an experiment.  As we learn more about those 3 areas above things progress until the next new big wave of innovation comes through.  For example, you could consider the web 1 to web2.0 as a ""scientific revolution"", there was a radical change in what was expected, the problems being solved, and the techniques to do it.<p>As for NASA, it's been crippled by bureaucracy and politics; and one could question if they ever had the systems engineering experience that tout as the majority of their Appolo and other groundbreaking systems were contracted out and had simple interfaces.  The space shuttle was a giant boondoggle that hampered space research.  Nasa will continue to innovate through the JPL and unmanned exploration - where science is done.<p>As for pure research, google now provides world class machine translation for free and continues to do research in that field at a scale that would be difficult for an academic lab to achieve.<p>Mobile is a game changer in the 3rd world - it allows poor farmers to understand market prices and integrate with the rest of the world. Social seems like it has/is radically altering society - it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.<p>Lastly, I agree we need pure research and I support it, I personally prefer applied, but I think that we've barely scratched the surface of how computers/internet can improve the world (with our current technical and scientific understanding).  And we're opening up whole new avenues of study  - complexity science, computational social science, web science, etc.",1325497258

3415321,comment,3414977,3415168,0,0,kijin,,,"A ""Kuhnian revolutions"" doesn't need to be a wholesale replacement of assumptions underlying an entire field of inquiry. Sure, most of the examples he used in his original book were drawn from such large-scale paradigm shifts. But especially in his later writing, Kuhn seems to focus more on what we might call ""micro-revolutions"": paradigm shifts that affect only a small part of the relevant science or technology, but which work in much the same way as large-scale scientific revolutions. Of course this isn't the only interpretation out there, and philosophers of science can disagree among themselves all day long. But much of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge research that took place after Kuhn's book followed this broader interpretation, and studied small-scale changes in very narrow sub-fields of science as well as larger ones.<p>In other words, Kuhnian revolutions aren't as rare and far between as his original book might seem to suggest.<p>New concepts in IT might not ""completely supplant"" their predecessors, but their rise to prominence can certainly be called revolutions in the area(s) that are irreversibly changed by them. For example, very few people nowadays think that APIs on the Internet should be anything other than RESTful. Previous paradigms for remote computing protocols have been almost completely supplanted in this area. Likewise, table-based HTML layouts have been completely supplanted by CSS in the last 10 years. The change, of course, was motivated by the previous paradigm's inadequacy in addressing the needs of the evolving Web. There are lots of examples like this, even trivial ones, that can nevertheless be called miniature Kuhnian revolutions.",1325495409

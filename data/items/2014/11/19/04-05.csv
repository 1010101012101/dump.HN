In the trade example of buying the dip in AAMRQ (prior blog post on my site), I am making the market more efficient (I&#x27;m saying this with the benefit of hindsight, of course). AAMRQ was moving adversely against its clear fundamental value (based on a stock merger deal with US Airways) and by buying it on weakness, I&#x27;m adding liquidity on the side that it should &quot;eventually go to&quot;. This only works if I&#x27;m consistently right more than wrong. I also short garbage stocks that have no fundamental value, another example of trying to restore efficient prices. Price discovery is important so capital isn&#x27;t allocated inefficiently.<p>3) Impossible to ban trading without destroying market liquidity. It&#x27;s also way too difficult to define what trading is helpful vs. parasitic and have everyone agree on it.

Some airports legally allow Uber to stop by. Uber is incredibly better than the previous Taxi service for both the employee (read about Healthcare), and for the consumer (this is obvious). Congress people use Uber all the time.

If H is a secure hash function that outputs a value in the set {0,1}^128 (a 128 bit output), then H(a) and H(a+a) should both be 128 bit outputs whose mapping are indistinguishable from values chosen truly at random from this set.

It&#x27;s at a nice relaxed pace where it&#x27;s unlikely a cyclist will be surprised or an equipment failure is going to be catastrophic.  The use case is going to dictate what equipment is going to be needed.<p>When I had an internally geared hub, I had it fail on a steep uphill where I was standing to get enough torque down, where it essentially went into neutral, similar to a chain snapping.  This almost threw me off the bicycle.  Netherlands, relatively flat.<p>I&#x27;ve since switched to a road bicycle and traveling at higher speeds.  Once a taxi blindly crossed in front of me, sending me hurtling over the taxi.  I landed on my head, lost consciousness briefly.  Helmet was deformed.  Without it, the outcome would have been much more catastrophic.<p>Another incident, this time going slowly down a steep mountain road, while tightening my line to avoid an oncoming car, the front wheel slipped on leaves sending me down to ground.  Landed mostly on my side but helmet hit the ground really hard, enough to stun me.  The inner support of the helmet broke mostly free of the outer shell but stayed in place because of the chin strap.  This too could have ended badly with no cell phone reception for about 15km and a civilization 30km away.<p>Anyways...  it depends on use case.  Over here in Tokyo, the utility bicycles and cyclists are just like the Netherlands.  Sedate pace, low number of incidents.  The roadies and faster cycle commuters have necessary equipment including helmets, safety glasses, gloves, blinkers, and lamps.<p>I recognize I have a higher risk profile and take on extra precautions.",1416370555

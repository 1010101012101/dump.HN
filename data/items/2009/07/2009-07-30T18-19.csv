732798,comment,732701,732701,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I have had three or four discussions about this in the last couple days because of the event (swagapalooza.com) I'm hosting this September. The whole purpose of the event is to bribe bloggers with new and interesting products; I am trying to be as blatantly transparent as possible to avoid these ethical issues. There really does need to be an above-ground ethical way that marketers and bloggers can interact, but it's been a huge pain because of the long history of astroturfing.<p>I have been taking a really hardline approach by just not allowing people back to the event next year if they violate the ethics guidelines, but even still it's not very black and white. For example, you never see a NYT book review saying ""disclaimer: I got this book for free at the library."" In fact it's standard industry practice not to disclose even when you've done you're review based on a free promo book, because it's understood that you're paying for the product with your time. Same with DVDs. But should we go above and beyond the standard practice and make people disclose these things anyway? Then you have people feeling embarrassed by implying that their six hours or whatever it took to read the book could possibly be worth less than the 20 bucks it cost. Either way, it's kind of a tricky situation.<p>The problem is for the last ten years we've had all these CEOs working 90 hours a week who pretend to be potheads who just sit around playing fooseball whenever the journalists show up. Journalists love these masturbatory stories because they get tons of traffic so they are happy to go along with them. But the issue is that idolizing these actor-CEOs just creates all these myths like ""people will find your product and buy it if it's good, so marketing is only for bad products."" This leads to all these distorted ideas about what's ethical and what's not ethical.<p>There's nothing wrong with giving away free products, it's how every single business gets started. No web designer can charge 30k per site without a portfolio, because no one will buy a website unless they trust that the designer can deliver on their promises. And the only way to create these portfolio sites is by doing them for cheap or free. It's the same for products, no one will buy it unless they trust it will deliver on its promises, and you just can't create that without giving away a lot of stuff to create a 'portfolio' of people who trust you.<p>/rant",1248979502

The bottom line is that data interoperability is good and it's really not that hard to accomplish. RDF puts forward a scheme to accomplish this with a distributed, directed graph structure that incorporates universally recognizable IDs. I cringe whenever I hear someone talk about how it makes the machine more intelligent or how easy it is to do XYZ using semtech... It's about making extremely precise descriptions of things and gives certain tools (RDF, OWL and inference engines) to make working on abstract models easier, but there is a hell of a lot of work involved in getting something really useful going.

However they all fail to see the basis of where the other party is coming from. They want to be adequately rewarded for you using their content. However adequately differs very much from person to person, you may think that a news story costs a quarter to read, I may think it costs 15 cents, the CEO of AP may think it costs a buck fifty, and the 13 year old down the street thinks AP should pay him to read the news story.<p>The problem that news companies suffer that makes this a significantly different problem for them rather than a company like the RIAA is that journalists get paid by the company as a primary source of income, journalists have to get sent places which costs the company money, and the company's primary source of revenue is the output of the journalists. For a second lets forget print media ever existed, in the current state of the web where media such as this is demanded by users to be free this is a failing business because of extravagant costs, and almost no profits. Why print media is a failing is because less people buy print and more people read it online.<p>There are players who beat the market by having a niche audience, low costs, and a high price, ie the Economist. Unlike the NY Times or AP they didn't have to send several photographers and journalists to China several times for pre, during, and post Olympics.

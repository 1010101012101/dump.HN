'map (+ 2) list' is much easier to read than a list comprehension.) Besides, I am not sure why you couldn't generalize map to lazy structures the same way you do with for--Python might not do that, but that is again Python's fault.<p><i>Conceptually</i>, a for...in loop is basically like a map, except that it doesn't return a list. Of course, this is yet another fault of Python with an arbitrary separation of statements and expressions. If the for...in loop was just an expression--and that's basically what a list comprehension is, if you squint--it would probably be exactly like map.<p>My real point was that the only way to get C-style for-loop behavior in Python is to do for i in range(a,b), which is basically equivalent to map fn [1..10].",1330055781

That depended on what I searched and some algorithm, but it didn't depend on who I was.<p>Now things are slightly shifting towards a personal search. Google already said that eventually the local search won't be possible to deactivate. In addition to that the search is becoming more and more related to social network results (what your friends searched or commented on) and if Facebook will play a role in it I'm sure this will only become more relevant to search results.<p>Now, if I live in a specific area and I have specific friends, wouldn't this slow down my search for something different or prevent me from finding something different from what you would expect me to being looking for being a resident of an area and having certain friends?<p>This might seem too abstract but there is actually a million possibilities. It all goes back to the fact that now the search engine won't treat me anymore as anyone else, but it'll guess what I like or want based on my neighborhood and my circle of friends (read: if I lived in a wealthy/safe town my search would be different than if I lived in a poor/higher-crime area).<p>I think the solution could just be to have a couple of ""dimmers"" on how 'local' or how 'social' I want my search results to be.<p>After all, I don't need any locality or sociality if I'm searching for topics involving food in general, while I might like to have more local/social results if I want to know about what good food I could eat near where I am.<p>This could start from local/social but could be extended to more parameters of the search algorithms. For example, it would be so helpful to get rid of all the forums sometimes or limit my research to the forum in other occasions...<p>Isn't it better under all points of view (and it wouldn't even be hard for the users) to allow them to easily choose which parameters are more important to them in a search as opposed to guessing a series of parameters that work for everybody?",1330055335

The question isn't even directly about the specific evidence on the encrypted drive. It's about whether the act producing said evidence, itself, would be testimonial. If the prosecution ""knows"" you have this evidence, however  legally, of course they came by that knowledge, then the act of producing it isn't testimonial. If they don't know of <i>specific</i> evidence, OTOH, then compelling you to produce any evidence you might have would be.<p>If, for example, you were dumb enough to admit to a third party that you keep the map showing where you buried the bodies on an encrypted drive, that person's testimony might be sufficient. Worse, you might have let slip that's where the data is while being interrogated. Or maybe the Customs agent saw a file named ""XYZ Company Fraud.xls"" the last time you came back from overseas, and now you're being prosecuted for defrauding XYZ Co.

This is completely counter to the goal of Spdy to keep connections open and reuse them; the longer connections are used the less the initial dictionary matters.<p>Browsers won't keep SPDY connections open forever in the hopes of someday reusing them; the ""initial connection"" case will happen quite frequently in a normal browsing session.<p>> Even just visiting one page, average say 500 KiB, it save on average 121 bytes total. That's 0.02% reduction in size. This seems like a ""substantial win""?<p>When did you last visit a page with 500k of HTML?  I suggested the hopefully very common case of sending a very small request and getting back a very small 304.  The whole exchange consists entirely of headers; I just checked a few examples and got figures in the 300-400 byte range for request and response combined.  That would make 121 bytes closer to a 30-40% savings.<p>(Also, I'd love to see a reference for your figures on expected bytes saved through the prefix dictionary.)<p>> Yes if the very first request is an expensive CGI this may be some marginal benefit.

I dont honestly find a difference between asking him for password and asking him for anything else in any case proceedings.

If, for example Government has ISP logs of tons of torrent data downloaded by defendant router, one can fairly assume that illegal files are stored there.

3627838,comment,3627356,3627356,36,0,newbusox,,,"Realize that this is a fairly narrow opinion, and, in my opinion, not a particularly well-reasoned one.<p>The issue here is child pornography: the would-be defendant was suspected of having child pornography on various hard drives which were encrypted. The court states that the actual contents of the hard drive are themselves not testimonialthat is, they are not covered by the Fifth Amendment and, if the government had access to the hard drives, they could present whatever was incriminating on them into evidence. So the issue is whether the act of producing the documents is a testimonial act and therefore covered by the Fifth Amendment<p>The court concludes that the act of production is a testimonial act because, one, the testimony was not a ""foregone conclusion."" This holding is based on a case called Fisher v. United States, in which the Supreme Court stated that it was not testimonial to hand over certain papers that might have incriminating evidence because conceding that documents existed, that you had control over the documents, or that they were in your possession was not incriminatory given the circumstances of that case. Under the ""foregone conclusion"" doctrine, the government knew of the existence and location of these papers so the production of the papers added nothing or little to the government's information. If the government did NOT know that documents existed, they could not compel a would-be defendant to reveal the documents.<p>Second, and most importantly, the court concluded that decrypting the documents would ""use the contents of [the would-be defendant]'s mind"" because ""the decryption and production would be tantamount to testimony by Doe of his knowledge of the existence and location of potentially incriminating files; of his possession, control, and access to the encrypted portions of the drives; and of his capability to decrypt the files."" It's again important to note that this is a child pornography case: possession of child pornography is a crime, so if the would-be defendant here provided a decryption key, this would be tantamount to him admitting that he possessed the hard drive and had access to the files within itthat alone would constitute a crime if the files were found to be child pornography. This is therefore what the court later refers to as an ""implied factual statement"" and the Fifth Amendment protects this. Although the court also suggests that providing a decryption key might be like providing a combination (and therefore be admissible for Fifth Amendment protection on other grounds), it unfortunately devotes very little space to this discussionand this seems to be the really big issue here.<p>The case therefore leaves several unanswered questions: this is a child pornography cases where mere possession alone is a crime: what if that wasn't the case? What if this was a murder case and the defendant had stored notes about his murder on the computer? What if the foregone conclusion doctrine wasn't applicablewould the conclusion here be the same (most of the opinion is actually devoted to this discussion, which is less broadly applicable because, if the police know of the existence of specific files on hard drive, this doctrine is inapplicable)?<p>Anyhow: it still is possible to get access to these documents if the government gives him sufficient immunity, as the court notes. This would be pretty important because if no one could ever access these documents (which presumably would be possible if the would-be defendant doesn't decrypt them) that would be an enormous problem for our justice system.<p>In conclusion: the applicability of this case to future cases is unclear, so, for those that want this result, I don't really think this is a ""slam dunk."" There will likely be many future cases further developing this doctrine. As such, right now, it's very difficult to discuss the merits of the court's holding on the ""decryption is testimony"" argument (which, in my mind, is the most important) in a general sense, since the reasoning here seems very specific to the facts of case.",1330053076

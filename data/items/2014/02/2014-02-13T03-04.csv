Facets eat a lot of memory, especially if you are faceting high-cardinality fields - think fields like &quot;tags&quot; or any analyzed field.  High cardinality, analyzed strings is the easiest way to blow out the heap.<p>There are other reasons, but that is like 90% of GC issues.  To solve it, you need to make sure your faceted fields are configured well (usually not_analyzed) and assess how much memory is available.  You may be able to index and even full-text search ten billion docs on a single machine, but faceting it may just be too much to ask for a single node.<p>Omiting norms, disabling bloom filters on old indices and enabling doc values are other ways to help alleviate field-data pressure.<p>Other GC culprits can be: too large bulk requests, unbounded threadpool queues, or something like parent/child/scripts/filter cache keys eating all your memory.

Where there&#x27;s a reasonably direct land route between locations (note that this <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the case for, say, a Bainbridge Island - Seattle commute, buses are often faster than ferries.<p>Fuel cost is another factor -- on a per-passenger basis, boats use a considerable amount of fuel, I believe bus service is generally more efficient (low vehicle:passenger weight ratio).<p>On the positive side:  boats generally don&#x27;t suffer from congestion issues (though weather and fog may slow them down), and often afford more space per passenger with a greater ability to work en route, as well as the option to get out in the fresh air (though a brisk 20-50 kt breeze is rather more bracing than you might be prepared for -- the after-decks are generally quite pleasant though).<p>As for public-sector ferry services, there are numerous ferry services on the San Francisco Bay, many resurrected following the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake which took out a major bridge crossing (the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge), including service between San Francisco and Sausalito, Tiburon, Larkspur, Vallejo, Berkeley, Oakland, Alameda.

7229156,comment,7227820,7228511,3,0,einhverfr,,,"At the same time, I think it is inescapable, when studying how different cultures look at mental health and mental illness to see this as something which culturally constructed.  Personality disorders for example, or ODD, or the like can only be thought of as disorders of inconvenient personality traits and therefore the way mental illness has always been used, and in the historical context, there is a <i>very dark side</i> to coerced therapy (which btw is no less dark when we convince parents to give their kids antipsychotic drugs because their kids are defiant).<p>my problem with Szasz though is different.  He seems to accept the basic assumptions of mental illness that our society does, and therefore never frees himself from the problems of those assumptions.  There is no scientific basis for these assumptions, as they form, effectively, the threshold questions under which one can try to make neurochemical inquiry into mental health.  These assumptions are:<p>1.  Mental illness, to the extent it  exists, is objective and quantifiable.<p>2.  Social context is irrelevant to mental health.<p>3.  Therefore mental health is an individual issue.<p>Of course a libertarian will accept these assumptions because they are based on the assumptions of personhood behind that movement.   But what if both of the first two are wrong?  What if mental health is very much subjective and what if social context is an important factor in mental health?  If so, then, not only is the science based on bad assumptions but so is Szasz&#x27;s rebuttal to it, and mental health becomes more an art than a science.<p>None of this reaches the question of coercive therapy.  The fundamental questions are who, when, and how (both regarding the coercion and the therapy).  Obviously there are times when this is needed.  But we should not ignore the dark side this has had throughout history.",1392261956

See for example:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Antipsychiatry-Quackery-Squared-Thomas-Szasz-ebook/dp/B004E0Z3SG/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Antipsychiatry-Quackery-Squared-Thomas...</a><p>Quote from the book, by Szasz:<p>> In the late 1960s, a group of psychiatrists, led by David Cooper (1931-86) and Ronald D. Laing (1927-89), began to criticize conventional psychiatry, especially so-called somatic treatments. But instead of advocating the abolition of Institutional Psychiatry, they sought to replace it with their own brand, which they called &quot;Anti-psychiatry.&quot; By means of this dramatic misnomer, they attracted attention to themselves and deflected attention from what they did, which continued to include coercions and excuses based on psychiatric authority and power. Thus, antipsychiatry is a type of psychiatry. The psychiatrist qua health-care professional is a fraud, and so too is the antipsychiatrist. In Psychiatry.The Science of Lies, I showed that psychiatry-an imitation of medicine-is a form of quackery. In this volume, I show that antipsychiatry-a form of alternative psychiatry-is quackery squared.<p>> For more than a half century, I have consistently asserted two simple but fundamental propositions: mental illnesses do not exist, and coercions justified by them are wrong. Anyone who seeks to help others must eschew the use of force. Not a single antipsychiatrist has ever agreed with these principles or abided by these practices. Subsuming my work under the rubric of antipsychiatry betrays and negates it just as effectively and surely as subsuming it under the rubric of psychiatry. My writings form no part of either psychiatry or antipsychiatry and belong to neither. They belong to conceptual analysis, social-political criticism, and common sense. This is why I rejected, and continue to reject, psychiatry and antipsychiatry with equal vigor.",1392260943

7229069,comment,7223582,7224608,1,0,reversethrust,,,"As for the whole discussion about IBM&#x27;s involvement with &quot;cloud&quot; - I guess it depends a bit on how you define it.  AIX first started virtualization on a large scale years ago, didn&#x27;t they?  And since AIX 5, wasn&#x27;t every AIX instance an LPAR?  PowerVM / VMControl had the essential features of the cloud - virtualization, metering, billing, partition mobility, etc.  It was just never marketed in the high volume, low margin way that the public cloud providers are marketing.  But, I guess, even then, due to internal politics and protecting their teams, PowerVM and VMControl became like beasts.  Software that was produced (E.g. SmartCloud), by edict, had to use it, and those additional layers became a nightmare.<p>So, I think it&#x27;s wrong to say that IBM didn&#x27;t pursue things on the cloud front.  There was some work on it.  But the execs - not the worker bees - certainly screwed that pooch.

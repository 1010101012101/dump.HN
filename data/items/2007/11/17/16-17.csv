80952,comment,80727,80727,0,0,crucini,,,"> Somewhere, I dont know where, Im standing exhausted outside a hotel ballroom right after the umpteenth demo, and someone is giving me some ridiculous objection. Well, its all good and fine what FogBugz does, but we wont use it, because we need PROJECT MANAGEMENT.<p>A good salesman welcomes an objection like that.  It means, ""I'm ready to buy; but first you must solve this problem!""  One path forward is to ask the prospect, ""What is the biggest challenge facing you currently in project management?""  Then demonstrate how FogBugz helps with this challenge.<p>This assumes, of course, that FogBugz really can solve the prospect's problem.<p>The fact that the prospect's objection was easily overcome by another audience member tells me that a skilled salesman would also have easily overcome it.<p>> Excuse me, SIR? Do you have some kind of SUDDEN AMNESIA? Traumatic HEAD INJURY maybe? Did you WATCH the demo?<p>Maybe the demo doesn't communicate as well as Joel thinks it does.  A key to sales is recognizing the prospect's needs and objections as legitimate.  Indulging in negative thoughts about the prospect distracts you from understanding and addressing his objections.\n",1195317586

I know you're right, and I have a few ideas that I should start on and let evolve.<p>I am looking to join up with a few others (technical, design, or business/marketing) but am in the DC area now and will eventually be in Austin.<p>If anyone in Austin is interested in meeting, please lob an email my way.",1195317429

80945,comment,80915,80915,0,0,boucher,,,"The biggest benefit of MVC, in my view, is the amount of reuse it encourages.  When a view has no knowledge of what it has to do, you can reuse it an infinite amount of times.  A table view is a table view, it shouldn't need to know what its displaying.  A button shouldn't need to know anything about your app, because its just a button.  This is what makes Cocoa/IB so powerful.  In some instances, you don't even need to write a controller, you can just use a stock controller, like Cocoa's array controller.<p>I would also say that this is one of the biggest drawbacks of current client side web frameworks.  Reusing views is much more difficult than it should be, especially if you want to do anything remotely custom or complex, since subclassing is essentially not possible and delegates are very infrequently used.",1195315855

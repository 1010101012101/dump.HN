Annotations are built into the language, the entire point of them is to allow code to detect their presence in the bytecode and thus react at runtime. e.g. wrap a method marked as @Transactional in a database transaction.",1378969058

- we do a lot to influence our own intelligence (perhaps far more than we realize, since much of what we do is due to implicit socialization/upbringing)<p>If you&#x27;re going to use an analogy to a physical characteristic, than I&#x27;d suggest using weight not height: yes there are relevant genetic traits, but they&#x27;re only a fraction of the story.",1378969008

6372448,comment,6371932,6372397,14,0,derefr,,,"> They really don&#x27;t know what causes anxiety, or clinical depression.<p>True in spirit, but untrue definitionally. The thing is, the psychiatric profession still basically subscribes to a Behaviorist theory of mind when it comes to treating neurological problems. There&#x27;s no consideration of what&#x27;s going on in your head when you have a neurological malady; your head is a black box, where drugs go in, and altered behaviors sometimes come out. &quot;Clinical depression&quot; isn&#x27;t the name of a specific thing that we know goes on in the brain (in fact, it seems to be a whole cluster of things); rather, clinical depression is &quot;the thing which taking an SSRI usually makes lessen.&quot; When a psychiatrist says you may be clinically depressed, what they&#x27;re really saying is, &quot;you have <i>symptoms</i> that may be manageable by the effects of this or that drug.&quot; They have no idea whether they&#x27;re treating the root cause, or just masking it, and a lot of them don&#x27;t care. They just want to see your behavior alter, like a rat given a swim test.<p>And really, thinking of things like SSRIs as &quot;medicine&quot; is part of the problem. SSRIs and the like are <i>crutches</i>--given to you to lessen the symptoms of a problem enough for it to stop being <i>overwhelming</i>, so that you can actually manage to make it to the CBT-practicing therapist every day, have the energy to find the the better job to get away from your horrible boss, etc. I wrote more on this here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6347620"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6347620</a><p>(P.S.: In this case, though, if I might be a bit more pedantic: I didn&#x27;t say that all those maladies in my post were caused by those imbalances. I said that <i>inducing those imbalances</i>, in the way that Lyme disease does, will <i>mimic the symptoms</i> of those maladies. Clinical depression may not be &quot;just&quot; a serotonin imbalance--but inducing &quot;just&quot; a serotonin imbalance tends to produce the symptoms of clinical depression. ;)<p>(P.P.S.: note that I never used the word &quot;disease&quot; or &quot;illness&quot; once. See my link above--these words don&#x27;t apply to things like nearsightedness, so they don&#x27;t really apply to the kind of problems neurological imbalances manifest as, either.)",1378968234

This post brings up something I&#x27;ve been wondering about, and it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s really been bothering me the last few years.<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve become significantly less intelligent over time, and I can&#x27;t figure out if that&#x27;s really the case, or if it&#x27;s a different issue that simply makes me feel less intelligent.<p>When I was in high school, everything I learned was simple -- everything was a piece of cake.  I would program my TI calculator (with a list of assembly opcodes next to me) at the back of the class and basically ignore the lesson and then get the highest grade on every test.  Same in chemistry.  Every standardized test I took (SAT, ACT, etc.) gave results in the 99th percentile.  Same with the AMC and AIME.  I graduated 1/200 in my class.  I had all kinds of interesting programming projects in my free time from age 12 to 18.<p>Then I went to college: a STEM school.  The first semester went fine; I got all A&#x27;s.  The second semester, I got my first B ever.  The third semester, more B&#x27;s.  Eventually a C.  My final GPA ended up being 3.5, significantly lower than anything I had been used to.  I couldn&#x27;t stay awake during lessons in class.  I was sleepy all the time despite getting good sleep (8-9 hours) every night.  I never skipped class, but I may as well have considering how sleepy and groggy as I was.  This had <i>never</i> been an issue in high school.  I don&#x27;t ever remember getting sleepy in class then, even if the lecture was boring.<p>Suddenly, new subjects became incomprehensible.  The ease at which I previously absorbed new material was gone.  Nothing &quot;clicked&quot; anymore.  I&#x27;m in graduate school now and still nothing &quot;clicks&quot;.  I attend department seminars where visiting professors present their research, and it may as well be alien gibberish.  I feel like I&#x27;m just faking my way through grad school at this point.  I can still manage A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s in classes without ever understanding the content only because of the way the grading system&#x27;s designed.  Luckily, I seemed to have retained my programming capabilities.<p>I can&#x27;t figure out what caused this.  One option is physical: perhaps something chemically changed within my brain.  Virus, physical trauma, getting older?  No idea really.  The other option is environmental.  In high school I only had dial-up internet access, so anything I wanted to download, I had to <i>really</i> want.  It was an all-day ordeal to get a 3 MB file.  It was almost impossible to goof off online.  Nowadays I get on the internet and just get distracted.  I can&#x27;t get into side-projects like I used to be able to.  I still have the strong <i>desire</i> that I used to, but not the motivation.  I don&#x27;t know where it went; why would my personality just change for the worse like that?  I almost wonder if skimming huge amounts of information online has somehow re-trained my brain to not absorb knowledge anymore.<p>Has this happened to anyone else?  Have you figured out a way to reverse the process?  I would love more than anything to have the incredible clarity with which I used to understand new subjects rather than this fuzzy, muddy feeling with everything I try to learn.",1378968164

How does it work when it comes to buying in the appStore?

But anyway, the numbers still work out at any income level -- if you invest 20% if your income at 8% for 23 years, you can then live off the savings for the next 40 years (assuming you withdraw from your savings 80% of your income level, which is the amount you were living off previously, and that the savings still nets you 8% annually).  So if you are making 20,000, and invest 4,000 a year (20%), your are living off of 16,000.

It betrays deep misunderstanding of what Israel actually wants and what would benefit it (which makes all the rest suspect too). Weak Assad would benefit Israel greatly. Despite all the saber-rattling, Syria would never seriously think of going to war with Israel, because that would mean the end of the current Syrian regime. Helping Hezbollah? Sure. Passing weapons from Iran to whomever that could hurt Israel? No problem. But direct conflict? No way. Cold war is the worst Assad would ever do.<p>However, everything changes if Assad regime falls and rebels - among which would be such organizations as Syrian Islamic Front or Syrian Islamic Liberation Front, with predictable amount of love for Israel - were to come to power. They would have no experience of losing the war like Assad regime had, and no problem with suffering a bit more of mayhem is it&#x27;s for the good purpose - after all, that&#x27;s just what they did right before it and succeeded. And they&#x27;d own all munitions that Assad regime had assembled (at least those that left after the war, but there would probably be sizeable amount left, and if not, Putin could help), including WMDs. How there&#x27;s any benefit for Israel in that?<p>Israel would be glad to have Assad&#x27;s ass get some thorough kicking. However, having an explosive unstable government with WMDs on its borders is not exactly one&#x27;s dream. Israel already has this problem with Lebanon, and it didn&#x27;t work that well so far.

Speaking as someone who has been around the block but prefers to work as an individual contributor rather than a manager, I have observed any number of important skills that are prevalent among effective managers that most technical folks start out unaware of. Risk assessment skills -- which are often based in having enough experience with both successful and failed projects -- are a good example. Another is the willingness to take responsibility for what often seem like nonsensical decisions that have to be made due to business or practical constraints. The latter is something that virtually no one <i>likes</i> to do, but often needs to be done in real life.[2] I could go on indefinitely, but I hope a couple of examples will suffice for now.<p>[1] <a href=""http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh0blbt3bs1qz8yeno1_400.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh0blbt3bs1qz8yeno1_400.jp...</a><p>[2] I was too slow to pick up on this lesson in real life until I saw the way Tom Hanks told Gary Sinise he was being dropped from the mission in the movie <i>Apollo 13</i>.

Reverse cargo cult happens when people postulate that there actually were no actual planes ever, just those people that claimed they fly the planes are much better at pretending (or, as you say now, in PR) than the cargo cult practitioners, thus they appear to have more success, even though under the pretense there&#x27;s no actual essence in either case, and the essence doesn&#x27;t actually exist and is just a lie.<p>Of course, it is trivially obvious to any informed person that while we have major undeniable problems with surveillance running amok and other serious problems in the US, situation with personal rights and liberties in the US is way better than in Russia.

While for other people, Java and C++ are just examples of a particular approach to adding some OO features to an otherwise C-like language, and aren&#x27;t definitive (or even necessarily <i>very good</i>, particularly in the early forms) examples of OO support in a programming language.<p>This leads to both a narrow idea of what OO is (mostly limited to the way those languages differed from C), and the idea that OO is incompatible with FP (because early Java and C++ had poor FP features, even though some earlier languages in which the OO paradigm had been supported had much stronger functional features.)",1450115688

Because of this, I have to handle CS manually and can&#x27;t just let the SPI peripheral handle it. Fair enough, not a big deal. So I pull CS low, stick some data into the output register, and wait for TX_BUSY to go to 0 (i.e. done transmitting). Unfortunately, TX_BUSY goes low after the rising edge of the last bit, but before the falling edge of the clock back to idle. Despite the device saying that it&#x27;s active on the rising edge of the clock, it totally disregards input data if CS goes back to idle before the last falling edge of the clock.<p>Solved by adding some nop cycles. Easy to count how many are necessary because the peripheral and CPU are deterministic as described in the article, but damn what a debugging nightmare.",1450115678

In my opinion, a high resolution 5&quot; AMOLED smartphone is superior to any other reading device including paper and e-paper, except for works that are diagram/table heavy, and for reading outside where glare becomes an issue.<p>- AMOLED means perfect blacks, use white on black for nighttime reading<p>- internally self illuminated for night time reading<p>- light weight and lack of page turning allows wide variety in reading positions.   The use of volume keys for page turning allows easy one hand operation, improving the number of positions available<p>- narrow width eliminates horizontal eye scan.  This is important -- most people do not read a word at a time, their brain processes an entire phrase at a time.

It&#x27;s impossible to be an expert in everything, and so you need to quickly judge <i>who</i> the experts are and defer to them.  And it&#x27;s made doubly difficult because competence and confidence are often inversely proportional: once you&#x27;ve put in all the detailed study necessary to actually become an expert, you understand just how much you don&#x27;t understand.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m actually with the article on this one: it&#x27;s on Linda to learn to speak up and become more confident.  Why?  Because of game theory.  The situation where everyone projects a realistic assessment of their own confidence is not an evolutionarily-stable strategy.  It is trivial to &quot;defect&quot; and project high confidence in an area of low competence, the cost (to the individual) of doing this is low, and the chance of detection is also low in most situations.  That means that any large population will tend toward being filled with blowhards; statistically, somebody is gonna do it, and then once they do it everyone else has to become a blowhard to keep up.  And so analyzing this rationally, your only choice is to become a blowhard yourself, ideally while also keeping factual discipline so your ideas are themselves usually right.<p>Interestingly, I&#x27;ve seen some very good managers make their careers off of &quot;confidence arbitrage&quot;.  Basically, they learn to recognize and surround themselves with people who have low confidence but high competence.  They then take the opinions of these individual contributors (which are often right, but often stated equivocally) and then repeat them to upper management with zero doubt, basically providing a confidence boost to other peoples&#x27; opinions.  This helps viewpoints that are <i>right</i> but imperfectly stated get heard, and it makes the manager seem like a genius.  Win-win for everyone.",1450114109

Anyone can contribute their knowledge, join teams or simply follow the progress as an observer. Guaana Challenge design is largely influenced by CERN and ESA innovation programs and now we are ready for your input. Visit our About Challenge page to learn more.<p>Question that probably comes to many minds is, ​&quot;How is this sustainable?&quot;. From day one, we decided that our platform should empower scientific collaboration and amplify our collective intelligence while, remaining completely free to use. To cover our expenses we offer companies a subscription model instead.<p>Companies subscribe to Guaana and start following Challenges in order to recruit top talent. Based on their hiring needs, companies receive a curated overview of top knowledge providers. This enables companies to select candidates based on their excellence, collaborative skills and passion. Our pilot just started with 6 companies and more will join shortly. Feedback so far has been super positive from both scientists and companies.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing - Guaana is entering it&#x27;s growth phase. We have 500 awesome community members already present. I want to invite you to join them and to share your feedback with me. It means a lot to all of us if you jump in, take a look around and share your thoughts.

Modern languages tend to be designed to be easy to parse, anyway. That was a key motivation in the design of Pascal. Sure, there are pathological grammars that you would be hard pressed to write unambiguous BNF for, but in the real world the best answer is probably to avoid those grammars!<p>Here&#x27;s a bit more of what he said, heavily snipped:<p>> Limited RAM Forcing Multiple Passes<p>> All the early compiler writers had to deal with this issue: Break the compiler up into enough parts so that it will fit in memory. When you have multiple passes, you need to add data structures to support the information that each pass leaves behind for the next. That adds complexity, and ends up driving the design.<p>> Batch Processing<p>> In a mainframe compiler as well as many micro compilers, considerable effort is expended on error recovery ... it can consume as much as 30-40% of the compiler and completely drive the design. The idea is to avoid halting on the first error, but rather to keep going at all costs, so that you can tell the programmer about as many errors in the whole program as possible.<p>> Large Programs<p>[Basically comes down to &quot;This is 1980s Micro Land. We don&#x27;t have mmap or virtual memory in general. The simple way is to keep everything in RAM and encourage small subroutines.&quot;]<p>> Emphasis on Efficiency<p>[This is an interesting point.

The reason is that AnyObject corresponds to an Objective-C object, an object that can exist in the Cocoa world. We still write apps in the Cocoa framework so mostly we deal with AnyObjects. And often times (in the case of strings for instance) there is implicit bridging between the two sorts of objects. Then there is also an Any object, which is not (necessarily) an AnyObject, but is the Swift equivalent of the Objective-C general object (represented in Swift by AnyObject). All very confusing, and inexplicably confusing if you consider that Swift had a chance to start with a clean slate.</i><p>How is that confusing, and much more &quot;inexplicably&quot; so?<p>It&#x27;s clearly because Swift wanted to take advantage of its clean slate that this is the case. So you have AnyObject for items that need the legacy Objective-C object tree support, and Any for the Swift native equivalent.<p>Eventually this allows them to drop AnyObject, and keep Any when they&#x27;re finally able to go all-Swift.",1450112747

Gen-Xers have complained for decades about locker room nudity (it&#x27;s a standard trope of comedy from the 80s and 90s, in fact), so in context, at least some of those insecurities are clearly inherited.",1450112431

Is it a sign people are recovering confidence after the 2008 economic downturn? Maybe - but it might just mean all his/her friends from school are getting married and having kids, and more people do that at age 25 than at age 18. Maybe society hasn&#x27;t changed at all :)",1450112426

You have to consider that most people flying these will be enthusiasts doing it for a hobby and they might not be aware of all the regulations or have the resources to handle such a charge. Having huge default punishments like this has a potential for abuse: Say you record bad cop activity and they find you didn&#x27;t register, bam they have huge leverage on you. This works out disproportionately for the FAA rather than the average joe who might be bothered by creeps or people being reckless. The only way I can see the FAA try to offset this is if they dutifully educate people about the registration requirement. Even then I still don&#x27;t see a reason for such a harsh punishment.",1450112410

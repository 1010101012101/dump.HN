981053,comment,979170,979170,0,0,Chi019,,,"<i></i><i>No, Lewontin's fallacy is the belief that if this is true for every trait, the populations are indistinguishable.</i><i></i><p>Physics Prof Steve Hsu explains the Lewtontin fallacy here:<p>Further technical comment: you may have read the misleading statistic, spread by the intellectually dishonest Lewontin, that 85% percent of all human genetic variation occurs within groups and only 15% between groups. The statistic is true, but what is often falsely claimed is that this breakup of variances (larger within group than between group) prevents any meaningful genetic classification of populations. This false conclusion neglects the correlations in the genetic data that are revealed in a cluster analysis. See here for a simple example which shows that there can be dramatic group differences in phenotypes even if every version of every gene is found in two groups -- as long as the frequency or probability distributions are distinct. Sadly, understanding this point requires just enough mathematical ability that it has eluded all but a small number of experts.) Update: see here for an explanation in pictures of Lewontin's fallacy. I also edited the paragraph above for clarity.<p>On the other hand, for most phenotypes (examples: height or IQ, which are both fairly heritable, except in cases of extreme environmental deprivation), there is significant overlap between different population distributions. That is, Swedes might be taller than Vietnamese on average, but the range of heights within each group is larger than the difference in the averages. Nevertheless, at the tails of the distribution one would find very large discrepancies: for example the percentage of the Swedish population that is over 2 meters tall (6""7) might be 5 or 10 times as large as the percentage of the Vietnamese population. If two groups differed by, say, 10 points in average IQ (2/3 of a standard deviation), the respective distributions would overlap quite a bit (more in-group than between-group variation), but the fraction of people with IQ above some threshold (e.g., >140) would be radically different. It has been claimed that 20% of all Americans with IQ > 140 are Jewish, even though Jews comprise only 3% of the total population.<p><pre><code>    ...The imbalance continues to increase for still higher IQ’s. New York City’s public-school system used to administer a pencil-and-paper IQ test to its entire school population. In 1954, a psychologist used those test results to identify all 28 children in the New York public-school system with measured IQ’s of 170 or higher. Of those 28, 24 were Jews.\n\n</code></pre>\nThere is no strong evidence yet for specific gene variants (alleles) that lead to group differences (differences between clusters) in behavior or intelligence, but progress on the genomic side of this question will be rapid in coming years, as the price to sequence a genome is dropping at an exponential rate.<p>What seems to be true (from preliminary studies) is that the gene variants that were under strong selection (reached fixation) over the last 10k years are different in different clusters. That is, the way that modern people in each cluster differ, due to natural selection, from their own ancestors 10k years ago is not the same in each cluster -- we have been, at least at the genetic level, experiencing divergent evolution.<p>In fact, recent research suggests that 7% or more of all our genes are mutant versions that replaced earlier variants through natural selection over the last tens of thousands of years. There was little gene flow between continental clusters (""races"") during that period, so there is circumstantial evidence for group differences beyond the already established ones (superficial appearance, disease resistance).<p><a href=""http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/01/no-scientific-basis-for-race.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/01/no-scientific-basis-for...</a>",1260186392

981041,comment,980497,980811,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Take a bunch of data. Go through this data by hand and select which data to use and which to throw away. Use proprietary models to adjust some of the data. Use proprietary models to merge data series from different sources, some of which conflict with each other, into a unified whole. When asked, refuse to divulge your models, your adjustments, or the raw data, delete data if necessary to avoid anyone else, especially critics, getting hold of it.<p>Given such methods one could provide support for just about any hypothesis using just about any sufficiently large set of data. Unfortunately, this appears to be the modus operandi of the CRU. Which is a tad bit disconcerting if one wants to hold any confidence in the CRU's findings, to put it mildly.<p>The theory of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is dependent upon having reliable climate models (specifically those that show that CO2 is such a predominant driver of climate that the increases in CO2 emissions due to human activity throughout the 21st century will not only be the overwhelming force shaping climate but will force a dramatic shift to a much warmer climate). The proof of reliable climate models is dependent upon accurate historic climate data.<p>Over the last 2 decades or so it appeared that climate researchers, most of them associated with the CRU, had not only constructed accurate climate models, but had produced reconstructions of historical climate which showed a dramatic uptick in global average temperature in recent years, and had also shown that this uptick was due to human activity (CO2 emissions). Moreover, their model showed that estimated CO2 emissions through the 21st century would result in increases in average global temperatures of nearly 4 deg. C and a rise in sea level of as much 60 cm.<p>Even before the CRU emails had been leaked there was much criticism of their processes and scientific results, drawing into question the validity of their models and historical climate reconstructions, and consequently the validity of those models' predictions. The CRU leak has shown just how shoddy their ""scientific"" methodology truly is, has brought increased attention to the debate, and has begun stripping away the once incredibly strong prejudice against AGW criticism (which a scant few weeks ago was considered by the average western intellectual to be akin to holocaust denying). This leveling of the playing field has caused the public to begin to weigh the arguments on their merits, and it turns out the AGW case did not have nearly as much merit as most people believed it did.<p>If you wish to dig into the science behind criticism of the CRU's results, I'd suggest reading up on:\n<a href=""http://wattsupwiththat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wattsupwiththat.com/</a> \nand,\n<a href=""http://www.climateaudit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.climateaudit.org/</a> (currently at <a href=""http://camirror.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://camirror.wordpress.com/</a>)",1260185065

This is the best piece I've seen written on this subject so far, with lots of context and a good background on what's happened over the last five years.<p>One thing I don't see mentioned, and which has been a huge red flag for me, is Intel's seeming pre-occupation with raytracing.  As a graphics programmer, I find it absurd that Intel would hope to mount a technological disruption on an industry that has been following a very steady course since SGI and Pixar were founded in the mid-80s.  I suspect that the Larrabee approach, as a whole, is a case of arrogance in believing that they can jump ahead of everyone else without having to slog through the hard, painful work of incremental improvements that has been taking place at nVidia and ATI/AMD.<p>That being said, the author correctly points out that Intel has invested in many technological mistakes in the past, and always eventually recognized their mistakes and changed course.",1260184050

Of course, stack-moving isn&#x27;t possible in C for various reasons.<p>What does libmill do here? Does it allocate a large stack right off the bat? What happens in a stack overflow, does it segfault or will it just trample over whatever is beneath it?<p>Edit: an ounce of investigation is worth a pound of answered questions, or something like that. It appears stack sizes are configurable, but default to 256kb [1] (for scale, go defaults to 2k), and are retained in a cache of size 64 [#L72] (by default). Also the bottom page is used as a stack guard if posix and mprotect are available [#L90].<p>From a cursory glance there appears to be some data races in the stack allocation code, though I could be mistaken.

O2 on one electrode and H2 on the other - split the gas collectors and you have pure-ish H2 and O2 seperated.  and the volume of h2 is twice that of o2... ;-)  hydrogen ion migration is a weird one - unlike most things that you think of as migrating through water, H+ ions seem to be about 10x faster.  last i heard (20 year ago memory here) is that the electric field actually messes with the hydrogen bonding in water so instead of migrating the h+ atom from one place to another, you flip the H --- O.....H hydrogen bonds along the line of potential and hey presto a bond where there used to be a hydrogen bond and a hydrogen bond at the other end.  to the casual observer it looks like the H+ atom whipped from end to the other super fast.  the problems associated with using hydrogen as an energy storage medium are still being ignored though.  we don&#x27;t know how to make it, store it, transport it or use it - IMHO it&#x27;s a dead end for the sorts of applications its being sold for, worse it&#x27;s distracting and costly use of time/$/people when decarbonising the energy system is running out of time.",1447828245

In today’s oceans, iron is in such short supply that it is a limiting nutrient—an essential element whose scarcity holds biological productivity in check. (A controversial climate-engineering scheme is even based on this fact; the idea is that if the oceans were fertilized with iron powder, plankton would bloom enthusiastically and then die, sinking to the ocean floor and sequestering large amounts of carbon there without, fingers crossed, wreaking havoc on the rest of the marine biosphere.) The primordial oceans, by contrast, must have been awash with iron. The richness of the rock formations—imagine all the steel in cars, cutlery, airplanes, buildings, bridges, and railroads—attests to that.<p>Thus when you write &#x27;Fe is used in living things, but only rarely&#x27;, the interpretation should be &#x27;iron is so important to living systems that a biosystem will use all of the biologically available iron. There is so little iron available that it&#x27;s a limiting factor to the ecosystem.&#x27;<p>With the plankton bloom being an example of 1) how iron is a limiting factor, and 2) a process by which iron is removed from the biosphere.",1447827982

Code designed for either of those architectures will be very suboptimal even if it does run adequately.<p>The Xeon Phi is a modern reincarnation of a <i>barrel processor</i>. It understands x86-64 opcodes but your data structures and algorithms need to be designed quite differently than vanilla CPU code if you want to optimize throughput. No one is doing that though.<p>In principle, if your code is correctly designed for the architecture, the Xeon Phi should significantly outperform both CPUs and GPUs for a wide range of use cases. The strength of these architectures is that their throughput is relatively insensitive to both latency and lack of trivial parallelism, which are the major bottlenecks to a lot of modern software performance. It is why Intel resurrected this style of computing architecture.<p>Basically, very few people know how to design software for these architectures even though it is pretty easy (<i>much</i> easier than GPU code). I have experience designing software for exotic architectures like this, I know what they are capable of in terms of throughput, but have never worked with a Xeon Phi. Nonetheless, the silicon specs suggest that someone that actually knows what they are doing should be able to significantly outperform e.g. GPUs for things like machine learning. Right now, it is basically being wasted because most developers treat them like weird CPUs.<p>I&#x27;d love to play with one of the new Xeon Phi processors to characterize its true performance but I am unlikely to see one.

She got a loan from a friend for $10K, out of which $8K was spent on getting incorporated, getting insurance, organizing pilot events, building the website, buying software to plug into the website and some other menial tasks. Overall, we have had little traction on the platform and that is because the idea will result in a huge cultural change so it will take a lot of effort to mobilize customers to try it out. Also, since we are financially constrained we have been bootstrapping and both been working on this ourselves, alongside school and haven&#x27;t been able to spend any money on hiring the right people to market this or to pay for any marketing. Recently, we have very misaligned interests and a lot of ugly arguments so I will like to move on and have informed the other cofounder about this. I however have spent the whole year working on this on the side and will not like to walk ork away with anything gained from it. I am trying to figure out how best to resolve things with the cofounder so we are both able to work away not feeling cheated. How do I go about this. Decide on an equity split arrangement given the effort which has been put in so far or work on dissolving the company assets where everything that has been worked on goes to the debt holder (including the technology, relationships etc). I prefer the later and of course she prefers the later. The third option is for her to only get the brand and the other assets are divided up between us. I will really appreciate is I can get some alternate views on this.",1447827056

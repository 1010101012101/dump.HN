3405362,comment,3404807,3404807,0,0,gecko,,,"So I don't really work at a start-up in a meaningful sense anymore (Fog Creek is a decade old), but my team is just a few people, and we develop in a start-up-like mode for Kiln, which is written almost entirely on a WISC stack.<p>I really, really like .NET, ASP.NET MVC, and C#.  And I even have grown to appreciate IIS 7 and SQL Server.  But if I left this company and did a start-up project all over again, there is no way in <i>hell</i> I'd pick .NET <i>for the kinds of things I find interesting.</i><p>Here's the rub: whenever we're doing something in Kiln that Microsoft anticipated, the environment is among the best I could possibly imagine.  There is something they already wrote that works, makes sense, runs quickly, and is flexible without taking you into IoC debugging hell.  If you want to take on something that is not using cutting-edge web technologies (i.e., you're not using WebSockets, or working with big file uploads, or doing strange routing, or what have you), you're probably in great shape.<p>But when we do something that Microsoft did <i>not</i> anticipate, it's nothing but pain.  Take allowing you to push Mercurial requests through HTTP: we <i>still</i> get into fights with IIS, two years down the line, because we keep encountering limits that Microsoft set that make absolutely no sense if you're not a vanilla CRUD app, and whose removal is poorly documented.  For example, IIS limits the amount of headers you can have.  This setting isn't actually even set in IIS proper; it's set in the generic HTTP layer of Windows, which can only be altered with a full-blown machine reboot.  So when one of our customers dutifully managed to craft a Mercurial request that was over 8k or whatever the limit was, we had to go reboot every last fricking production web server during our peak load time so that they could actually get their changesets through.<p>Or take streaming requests: ASP.NET is so insanely aggressive about not allowing you to stream in requests that we had to replace swaths the official framework with our home-grown solutions before ASP.NET finally relented and quit trying to suck multi-gigabyte requests into RAM.<p>Or take LINQ to SQL.  LINQ to SQL is great.  Usually.  If you're using it exactly as they intended.  When we wanted to make some of our models automatically supply some query parameters, though...well, let's just say there was a lot of T4 templating involved to get around sealed classes, and leave it there.<p>I think the successful start-ups are the ones that are most likely to be doing something ""weird.""  And when you're doing something weird, I think that Microsoft is the wrong stack to use.<p>If you ask me, <i>that's</i> why start-ups tend not to use .NET.",1325192328

I am starting to learn programming and for a lot of reasons, I think I rather learn an Open Source technology than a Microsoft one. Microsoft technologies are meant to work together and this will inevitably lead to you getting locked in, in a Microsoft environment. With Open Source technologies you always have options since they are platform agnostic even though they work better in UNIX-like environments. You can run any of the popular programming languages (Lua, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc) that are used in UNIX-like systems on Windows, and the server software used in UNIX-like systems is also available in Windows, but Microsoft technologies are Windows only. Other important difference is that Open Source technologies can be extended by their users, you don't have to beg anyone to extend the features of an Open Source technology.<p>At this moment my only computing device is an Android smartphone, you can't do much with it right, right. Ha, but guess what you can install Lua, Perl, Python & JRuby. With JRuby you can even access the full Android API. So I am learning Ruby from and with my Android smartphone. I bet I can't do this with Microsoft technologies.<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/</a>",1325192184

We do almost exclusively low volume work so the rapid prototyping is key to our design process, but very little of what we do can be done in plastics of any kind.

I'll caveat this with the fact that I primarily develop on a MacBook these days and my target environment for most projects is Ubuntu or Debian, in Java and Ruby.  However, I still do a fair bit of .NET work, and when I signed up for BizSpark I had the intention of building some .NET products with it.  The ultimate reason why I moved on (and this has actually changed since then) from that original idea was that it was a pain in the rear to find a host who would honor your BizSpark licenses.  So the choice was either try and deal with that mess, or buy my own gear and run my own infrastructure.  I prefer to bootstrap, so like I said, I've moved on.<p>Anyway, on the cost of BizSpark - you get to keep all the production licenses you spin up in the 3 years or pre-1 million mark.  Even if you graduate early, you get to keep, for free, all of those licenses and use the for perpetuity.  On top of that, MS (at least for my account, but I'd assume others) has waived the $100 graduation ""fee"".<p>That means I've gotten 4 Windows Server and SQL Standard processor licenses for free, which I can use perpetually with no cost.  I can also keep all of the dev tools, etc that I was granted via BizSpark, at no cost.  And with folks like Amazon now allowing you to supply your own licenses, it makes it easier to put those Windows licenses to work.<p>I really enjoyed the .NET development I did.  The platform has issues like any other, but presents a really integrated environment for just getting something together and getting it out there, and allowing for a pretty significant cost for performance ratio that is supplemented by a really nice core platform (I'm a fan of C#, in particular).",1325191475

And they'll provide a lot of the information you ~didn't~ get in that CS program. Like real world software practices, current tooling, and so on.<p>Yesterday we had a junior team member run into a problem with a data structure, so that led to an off the cuff tutorial on data structures (linked lists, hash tables, benefits, trade offs, etc) for several team members, but in the context of the current project.

The materials are weak and thus unsuitable for most products and 2. The efficiencies of scale of traditional manufacturing trump 3D printers in runs above 1k units.<p>Today your first point is true, however I use 3D printed parts as structural components in my robots and they are sound. I suspect in general material strength will increase until it meets the demands of how people want to use it. I hope you wouldn't make the argument that it <i>can't</i> increase in strength. There will always be material properties that can't be replicated in a fabber, but I do not know how many products in my life need these advanced properties.<p>Your second point ignores the decentralized nature of 3D printing. In total, yes, it will always be less efficient. But imagine a world where an Apple product launch means access to a new fabber file. Everyone in the world with a fabber could download and print the new product ... at the same time. No centralized manufacturing and distribution network could match that.<p>Some additional hurdles you don't mention: Material cost. $6 a cubic inch (my costs today) are really quite high. Material diversity. I need multiple materials for many objects I'd like to print. Speed. It takes <i>hours</i> to print something of moderate size.

You can therefore create tests which <i>only</i> test the metadata (your actual spec), and completely ignore the data.<p>The only thing left is ensuring your tests fail when you specify the wrong length, which <i>should</i> be assured by your spec (either a master-length value or a protocol-terminating character like \0 (where you touch on the escaping problem again)).  This is the exact same thing as ensuring start/end delimited tests pass/fail when you are adding/missing bits of your packet, or if the bits/bytes are misaligned, which you should be doing regardless.<p>Given this, using lengths means you can avoid creating or testing any (un)escaping code, and the bit-alignment tests are identical between the two - lengths are simpler and more easily testable.

We do not buy market share with ads, and we do\nnot make empty promises to capture customers.\nWe also include some services (such as a free year of SSL certificates and the ability to\nobfuscate your whois data) that other registrars tend to charge incrementally for. This is\nbecause we believe that your data is yours. We will never sell your private information as\nsome others do, and so we do not have that revenue stream.<p>We appreciate your willingness to consider Gandi as an ethical, no-bullshit alternative to\nGoDaddy. Right now a lot of domains are available at $8/yr through the end of 2011. We\nhope you will join us.</i>",1325189226

3405124,comment,3404209,3404209,0,0,da_n,,,"I was unfortunate enough to own one of the first Android devices, the HTC Magic (aka MyTouch3G). This was prior to, and also one of the first victims of, Android fragmentation. The process of discovering who was responsible for updates was the least open and opaque process I could have imagined. I had to resort to seeking out the information from other users on the Vodafone forum to discover that basically, no one actually cared. I had already bought the device so HTC had their money and didn't care, I was signed up to a 2 year contract so Vodafone had their money and didn't care, and Google got to license the phone as a Google Experience one, selling their app suite as well as me using their services. Google maybe cared a little, but they do not provide support or after care really unless talking to a perl script counts as support.<p>The underlying OS might be revolutionary in some ways, but the update process (at least the one sanctioned by Google) is so far away from revolutionary I find it hard to fathom the Android Reality Distortion Field I sometimes hear about this. It sucks. It gives the user next to no after care, it is all about the upfront purchase to the handset maker, the vampire like carrier fees, and the services provided by Google including all the advertising on the devices. I think people are evangelising this beyond what is rational.",1325188941

Especially if you invent some protocol that may have to receive programming language code or worse images/mp3s etc etc especially compressed/encrypted ones.<p>Unless your protocol will have very limited use cases it's almost impossible to know what data will be sent over it , so you can't really guarentee any single delimited character. Even if you do make the use case limited someone will want to use it in a way you didn't intend (look at HTTP for example).<p>I don't think they were talking about validating everything at TCP/IP level, especially since it's unlikely you or I could affect meaningful change to the TCP/IP spec anyway.

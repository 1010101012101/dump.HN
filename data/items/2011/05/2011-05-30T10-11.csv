I mean, if you have a program that needs to parse out the Linux kernel version then you could very plausibly have assumed the format vX.X.X[-something|.X], given it's been that way consistently for 15 years (since 2.1.0 in '96). Even the kernel's own scripts do that, as Linus mentions in the email. Now it's going to have format vX.X for the first time since 2.0.<p>I can't actually think of the use case for needing to parse the complete version string outside the kernel, but it doesn't sound stupid to me that you'd assume a canonical  format that's been there for a decade and a half.

Knowing who wrote what is a very useful piece of information (something Quora is addressing).<p>What about collaborative editing? Successful collaborative editing is made of two parts: software and a community. The software problem is largely solved; a working community of people who know and care, is the hard part. But it's also in the process of being solved by what StackExchange is doing: building sites around existing communities.<p>So here's what I think will eventually happen:<p>- human-machine interface / findability engine: Google<p>- clusters of (constantly updated) information: StackExchange sites (and others)<p>- niche content: your blog<p>In this future I'm not sure there's much room for Wikipedia; Wikipedia was built around the idea that there is such a thing as ""static"" knowledge or ""eternal truth"". There isn't: knowledge is a process and a conversation.<p>(Wikipedia is in fact a kind of cache for the current state of knowledge, but that problem could probably be solved differently and more efficiently.)",1306752409

So in this cases I should duplicate the quote object for every user... But maybe I can  let users edit quotes as long as they are not favorited by others... Thanks for this point. Until now you can just unmark the quote and create a new one, I'll take care about the rest.<p>> the export link seems to be broken<p>I'm quite sure it is broken by the quotation marks in your imported quote :) Thank you as well, I'll fix it.<p>> and when I click on the star the quote disappears.<p>That's true, because if you click on the gray star on your 'home' page, you unmark a quote and it disappears. This is a good point and makes it clear, that this behaviour is not obvious at all. Thanks for this. My idea was, that all you can do on the site is mark or unmark quotes.

The machine description is a list of instructions and what they do and things like timing and scheduling constraints.

It has a distinct combination of physical properties which give it monetary properties.  It is durable, malleable, divisible, rare, compact, portable, easily recognizable, and beautiful.<p>There are many good reasons to use steel instead of gold for flatware, kitchen sinks, and refrigerators, in spite of the fact that steel corrodes and gold does not.  This does not make gold ""useless"", it just means that gold has better uses.<p>Emeralds are very durable and far more rare than gold, but they are generally unsuitable as a monetary commodity because they are not malleable and easily divisible.<p>One distinct advantage of gold over bitcoin is that transacting in gold does not require a network connection of any kind, nor even the existence of computers.",1306751789

While I don't support this behavior without some sort of an understandable cause to compel them, I view the overall activities of ""oh noes; posted something on your website!"" and ""oh noes; got yer emailz!"" as an important part of boosting the immune system.

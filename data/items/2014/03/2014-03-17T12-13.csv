The 777 is significantly more advanced and I believe has some sort of fire detection in the wheel well; they would have known very shortly after takeoff if there was smoke.

7414719,comment,7413904,7413904,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"The problem with software engineers is that they embrace Cluelessness. Read up on the MacLeod hierarchy. Venkatesh Rao&#x27;s series is a great place to start: <a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-o...</a> .

Those&#x27;ll take a few hours.<p>The MacLeod pyramid has bare-minimum players (Losers) at the bottom. They aren&#x27;t really losers in the sense of being undesirable or weak; they know employment is a losing proposition and commit minimally (rational disengagement). In the middle are the overeager Clueless, destined for middle management but rarely able to cross the barrier (effort thermocline, which is where jobs transition from getting harder as one moves up to getting easier) between them and the cynical, politically savvy but rarely eager executives. At the top are the Sociopaths who are openly out for personal gain. Again, Sociopaths aren&#x27;t all bad (the label is more negative than what it describes) but what they are is self-interested and insubordinate. They won&#x27;t put the organization&#x27;s interests above theirs, and why should they?<p>The Clueless tier is the worst place to be, because you become the company&#x27;s true janitors. You&#x27;re always cleaning up the messes made by the bare-minimum players below you and the self-interested, capricious gods of industry above you. It leads to overwork and burnout (which can be the first step toward cluefulness and cynicism). You eat buttloads of a pie you don&#x27;t especially like (even if you once did, in moderation) and the prize for winning the pie-eating contest is... more of that same pie.<p>Software culture embraces the culture of the middle tier (the Clueless). Startup cults are even worse. They hire specifically to maintain certain illusions, and exclude people who might contradict those (i.e. over-40 engineers who might say, &quot;I&#x27;ve been here before&quot; when a death march begins or a ridiculous executive promise, never to be delivered, is made to motivate people to sacrifice their health.) The real reason these cultish startups discriminate on age and gender is that they don&#x27;t want to let in people who have the perspective to call the execs out on their bullshit.<p>Some people, steeped in middle-class eagerness and Cluelessness, struggle with the cognitive dissonance that hits when they realize that (a) there are no adults over adults-- something people&#x27;ve desired for thousands of years, so much as to make them up out of vapor and call them &quot;gods&quot;-- and (b) no organization is a meritocracy and advancement is <i>always</i> political. It&#x27;s not &quot;who you know&quot; over &quot;what you know&quot;. It&#x27;s what you <i>have</i> over those other two things. Knowing people isn&#x27;t enough. What can you <i>do</i> for (or to) people? Rather than acknowledge the ugly truth, they plow into their work (heads in sand) hoping the ugliness will go away. It never does. It starts to look like a context-driven case of OCD (&quot;I have to get this done and it has to be perfect&quot;). For some, it leads to exactly this.",1395060922

7414704,comment,7412872,7412872,3,0,fnl,,,"I am happy to have seen Ioannidis&#x27; talk on this very matter a while ago - very inspiring indeed.<p>However, I think, often such articles as the one in The Economist lead &quot;outsiders&quot; to the opinion that much of the current biomedical science is flawed. They say that &quot;only&quot;  10 out of 13 in the article have been shown to be reproducible, and while even three bad teeth are not good, it is not even clear what was wrong in the remaining three. It might be very trivial issues, or it might be fraud, who knows. Furthermore, it does mean that at least 3/4 of those papers were fine. Last, so far, the reproducibility results of the 50 cancer papers is still outstanding.<p>So while I do agree there is an issue at hand, it is a bit like with Apple vs. Windows issues: consumers of the former brand are used to high quality, so a single bug or issue in an Apple soft- or hardware quickly fills news outlets in the world, while nobody gives a damn about even the most critical issues in Windows, because their customers are used to it. While it is important to correct the (ab-)use of biomedical statistics, I think the way this is being presented to outsiders tends a bit towards sensationalism.<p>I do agree with Ioannidis&#x27; as far as that our papers should get more in-depth reviews (not only) of the statistics in them, but the problem is that we need to publish 2-3 papers per year that in turn need 3-5 reviewers per paper, so everybody has to do about 10-15 reviews per year. And by &quot;doing a review&quot; I do not mean just doing an &quot;intensive&quot; reading of the paper being reviewed in half a day, but actually looking at the data and methods and spending some days on it. I am not sure we have the time for that and I believe the reason is this madness of having to publish several papers per year just to survive. I.e., the real problem is our &quot;publish or perish&quot; system, nothing else. All this leads to the fact that it can be better to have dozens of junk papers than one good one, at least if you do not manage to get it to the very top (Nature, Science, Cell, etc.).",1395060664

Electrical fire starts, takes out ADS-B transponder, pilots unaware and continue the flight as normal\n2. They radio a goodbye as they leave ATC, still unaware of anything which means that a fire has taken out a transponder and they are unaware of that fact\n3. The fire is discovered. The crew put on full-face oxygen masks and the pilot makes for that airport either by dialling in a bearing into the autopilot or disengaging it and flying for it.\n4. They attempt communication but fail because the systems are out due to the fire<p>At that point, we then have a lot of things to consider: was it pilot input or autopilot that took them to FL450? When did the pilots lose the ability to land, either because of control surface damage or because they were incapacitated? In the event of being alive but unable to fly the aircraft because control surfaces were no longer responsive to cockpit or autopilot input, is there anything else they could/would do other than do some maths and work out when the inevitable crash was coming? If they could control some surfaces but not others would they use that to buy themselves more time, e.g. climbing to ceiling (FL450), or would they get low quick?<p>This theory raises quite a few questions then, but it&#x27;s a perfectly valid hypothesis: the issue for me around it is understanding why the pilots didn&#x27;t go on to make the landing suggesting loss of control or their own lives by that point. The only way we&#x27;ll get to understand that is by finding the black box which of course would explain the whole thing anyway.<p>This theory also suggests a likely ditching or crash into the water, and if that were the case then I would expect sonar operators over a large part of the region to hear the black box locator, pretty much as they did with the Air France crash.",1395060232

7414537,comment,7411341,7413580,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The headline doesn&#x27;t help, that&#x27;s for sure. The fact is that gravitational waves have been detected already, though indirectly, and a Nobel prize was awarded for the observations more than 20 years ago. That&#x27;s not why the BICEP2 results are a big deal.<p>The reason this news is important is two fold. One, the researchers were able to observe the effect of &quot;b-mode&quot; gravitational waves during the earliest moments of the big bang (within the first 10^-34 seconds) which reveal important details about the specifics of the big bang. They are indirectly observing an event which is older than all matter in the Universe, older than the cosmic microwave background, older than the cosmic neutrino background, older than dark matter even (which has a high likelihood of originating from the very early Universe when the 4 fundamental forces were still unified). Two, their observations are the first direct test for the theory of cosmic inflation which seems to have produced a definitive result and the result is significant evidence for inflation.<p>That, in turn, translates some theories into realities. For example, we tend to hedge our bets when it comes to estimating the size of the Universe, because only so much of it is visible to us. In a Universe where inflation holds the non-visible Universe must be unimaginably huge compared to the visible portion of it by many orders of magnitude. Also, most inflationary theories effectively produce multiverses (this is hard to explain, basically it&#x27;s like a foam of different regions of the universe which are effectively universes unto themselves due to speed of light / expansion rate constraints).",1395057905

The wiki/issue tracker actually require you to be online, which is the best thing about git: being able to work without network connection.<p>I&#x27;d like to find some project that syncs github issues with sd (<a href=""http://syncwith.us/sd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://syncwith.us/sd/</a>) or bugseverywhere (<a href=""http://www.bugseverywhere.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bugseverywhere.org/</a>), so that I could actually work on the issues without being online (the bigger pain point are attachments which need to be downloaded).<p>Another thing which I consider inferior to patches by mail are pull requests. Honestly, it&#x27;s very rare that I can accept a patch without some reformatting or minor corrections. I also never ask people to do such minor reformatting just to be able to click &#x27;accept&#x27;. Again, pull requests cannot be worked-on or accepted offline. Similarly, my patches sent to other projects are similarly handled by other authors.",1395057818

Single women are expected to sleep with coworkers and if drama arises then it&#x27;s not their fault, but men are expected to refrain from sleeping with coworkers and if relationship drama arises then it&#x27;s always the man&#x27;s fault if he dipped his pen in company ink. Your remark &quot;grow up&quot; is merely a logical fallacy used to conceal this double standard.<p>The &quot;banging&quot; was mentioned in the techcrunch article so it&#x27;s definitely on-topic.  How do you know that the other woman&#x27;s jealousy was not aroused by Julie&#x27;s projection of sexuality into the workplace via her demonstration of willingness to hook up with employees ?<p>When Julie hooked up with an employee she was demonstrating that in general she&#x27;s willing to hook up with employees which put her on the other women&#x27;s radar as a potential personal/political rival.  I seriously doubt the other woman would have felt threatened if Julie&#x27;s romantic foray hadn&#x27;t come into play..<p>Again.. a reasonable guy would never have made a post about this kind of thing on hackernews instead he would have just accepted the drama as the consequence of his risky <i>choice</i> to engage in romance in the workplace.  He would have just bit the bullet and moved on.  Julie on the other hand is wilding out and she comes off as an unprofessional drama queen.",1395057807

86471,comment,86362,86362,0,0,Zak,,,"I'm mostly happy with my Thinkpad Z61m. It's a 15"" widescreen machine that's fairly heavy. Its replacement, the much lighter T61 widescreen should be appropriate. It's much more configurable than the MBP; base configurations are much less expensive, and comparable configurations are a bit less.<p>I think Thinkpad quality peaked around the 600-series of the late '90s (mmm... carbon fiber) and has been dropping ever since. The Lenovo takeover hasn't helped, but IBM was so far ahead of everybody but Apple that I don't think anybody has caught up yet.",1196904289

I insist on NVIDIA so high speed drivers are ensured under Linux. Apple doesn't even make a 15"" laptop that runs at 1920x1200 and the others that do charge a premium. Dell is a great option if you (like me) expect to replace your laptop every 2 years and don't care that it's not a Mac.<p>",1196903387

I don't understand why apple went for a single vendor (at&t) distribution, i would have never done that, instead i would have used my strong brand power to distribute unlocked iphone thru multiple channels like walmart, costco, bestbuy etc. , this way customer would have got the power to choose their service provider - giving customer the power is always the biggest business benefit/wisdom in long and short term - if apple can hold the position against Hollywood for selling a song for 99c then they can do the same by selling unlocked iphone ... customer who don't want to use iphone as a phone device can still buy it to use it for playing music, video, surfing internet etc. I think this would have been a win-win situation .... \n",1191156351

It's not the strongest part of the book, but still well worth reading.  <p>As a taste, Pinker tracks the evolution of the myth that the eskimos have more words for snow than English-speakers.  He explains how this myth was manufactured by anthropologists who wanted to give credibility to Sapir-Whorf, and eventually took on the status of a ""fact"", appearing in textbooks and so on.",1191154000

9795878,comment,9795266,9795681,0,0,kendallpark,,,"Though I disagree with some of the logistics of this comment (like paying yourself or &#x27;earning&#x27; a car), I agree that sometimes what people need are more people, not money or handouts or programs. There are some problems that can&#x27;t be solved just by throwing money at them. Time and commitment are valuable resources as well. There are lots of people willing to donate money towards a cause. But how many would, say, foster a kid? That&#x27;s a huge time commitment and an emotional commitment as well. It&#x27;s also riskier on your end because you open yourself up to all the heartache that human relationships can bring.<p>It&#x27;s weird how so many commenters here seem obsessed with this utilitarian &quot;greatest good for the greatest amount of people&quot; approach to charity. Option A gives clean drinking water to 1000 people. Option B adds a drop in the bucket of funding for breast cancer research. Option C helps one child escape a life of violence on the streets. Who are you to look at these and try to quantity which has done the greatest good? It&#x27;s one thing to compare the effectiveness of programs in achieving their own goals, it&#x27;s another thing to try and rank totally different humanitarian efforts. These types of things can&#x27;t be quantified.",1435539559

 In my opinion, I think a) and c) would be the beginning of a solution. but B) not really because I honestly think EU is a &quot;joke&quot; since Germany is the reason why it still exists (economically speaking of course). I believe Greece should get out of the EU, and inject money in its economy through some quantitative easing. I know it will cause the money to loose its value but it might be meaningful if the greeks could produce greek and consume greek maybe live in autarchy for a couple of year why not ?? But the only thing I see is that the solution will not come from the EU and for investors, let&#x27;s be honest, they re nowhere near recovering their full investments.

About the only caveat I&#x27;ve found is that you have to be pretty particular regarding what format you choose, but I&#x27;ve found that Windows&#x27; format for UDF tends to make the most compatible disks.",1435536081

For early-stage ventures especially, the quality of the people seems to matter a lot. Therefore, there&#x27;s a high probability I&#x27;d know the founders (or at least some employees) before I put in any money, and therefore, cold emailing wouldn&#x27;t be necessary.",1435536065

Help them find a better job, or make a better financial plan, or eat healthier, or just listen to what they have to say and tell them they can call you if they need someone.<p>This is by far the biggest impact a person like Paul Buchheit could make on the world. Even if his $20k could go 100% to a better water bottle in Africa, or a more efficient hybrid, or whatever, it will pale in comparison to how he could personally change someone&#x27;s life if he walked up to them and took the time to try.<p>So go blow $20k at the club or on a cool car, after you&#x27;ve earned it by hitting the streets and solving your neighbor&#x27;s problems for 100 hours. Someday your neighbors might do the same ;)",1435536043

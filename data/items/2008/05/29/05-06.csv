It comes with  a faster processor, RAM can eventually be upgraded to 4GB, it has more USB ports, DVD/CD-ROM, battery life is supposed to be better.<p>What do you recommend I get?",1212040793

203035,comment,202342,202342,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Seems like there a couple of interacting problems but no one size fits all. It does seem like WalMart would be useful for high frequency low severity (adjusting for risk of some high severity situations lurking in the intake). Trauma needs a trauma center, chronic progressive conditions benefit from Kaiser's approach (and have proven amenable to pharmaceuticals in many cases). It's not clear where to put cancer, if we can't screen and catch it early we don't seem to have a good answer. Stroke and heart attack may benefit from early intervention that's one time plus physical therapy follow up. There may be some more categories.<p>Trauma (e.g. automobile accident, gunshot, explosion) => trauma center<p>High Frequency Low Risk (for most: cough, cold, flu) => WalMart<p>Chronic (heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, gout, glaucoma, cystic fibrosis) => pharmaceuticals / Kaiser pro-active healthcare<p>Low Frequency High Risk (cancer, heart attack, stroke, appendicitis) => medical center / surgery<p>Getting fewer people to smoke would have a huge impact.<p>You also need to distinguish between an intervention that gives a 1 year old another 60-80 years of life and a 72 yr old another six months, they may cost the same but the first has a much stronger impact on society. I am not saying deprive anyone of medical care, but understand there may be an enormous cost for medical care in the last year of life. Good health is dying more slowly: good medical care doesn't save your life, it lets you die of something else a little (or a lot) later.",1212039869

My idea (never implemented) was to set the background images on visited anchors to a dynamic image url that could be used to track pageviews from other sites, to perhaps determine what links from your site your visitors found most interesting, even if they didn't click to them <i>from</i> your site.<p>There are plenty of terrible use cases for something like this, but also plenty of benign and probably useful cases as well. If you were a search engine, for example, you could determine if a user has been to sites that show up in the search results, even if they don't click on the links from your site.<p>The full write-up of my strategy is here: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/6fnjod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/6fnjod</a>",1212039257

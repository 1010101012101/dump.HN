  Update Balances
  Call CC Processor
  Commit
</code></pre>
That would eliminate &quot;the billing system charged customer credit cards to increase account balances without being able to update the balances themselves&quot; -- you don&#x27;t go call a non-transactional CC processor until you&#x27;ve actually been able to process the update in your own system (which you can easily rollback).<p>If you&#x27;re worried about Commits failing (due to not using pessimistic locking, for instance), then separate it into two transactions. That way when you go to process the CC the next time, you have a record stating there&#x27;s already a transaction in-flight.<p>For financial records, I&#x27;d expect a bit more care. Sounds like they had proper records, but only as a backup/logging.<p>(Even for telecom, in which I work. There are fully ACID databases that have no problems handling millions of transactions/sec.

When AWS goes down, which is far more frequent than the Apple Dev center, are you still making tin foil hat assumptions, despite the fact that AWS outages affect a significant portion of the web, while the dev center means that we can&#x27;t download a particular tool to build an App that obstensibly makes us money.

I never worried about RSI until I had pain in my hands the went on for weeks. We can debate until the cows come home about whether the mental stress caused the hand pain or whether the ergonomics caused it--in the end it&#x27;s the same pain and same RSI and just semantics.

As James [Gosling] says, Java requires you to pin down decisions early on...&quot;<p>My experience with modifying Lisp and Java programs has largely been the opposite.  I&#x27;ve been working on a Java application for the past few weeks, and the design of the program has changed several times as I&#x27;ve thought of new features to add and cleaner ways to organize my code.  Today, I had a class X that was responsible for keeping track of a certain variable, and I wanted to move that responsibility to class Y.  I deleted the relevant field and all references to it in class X, and Eclipse highlighted all of the errors that change introduced.  I fixed the highlighted errors and added the new methods I needed to class Y, and when I tested the relevant functionality, I saw that I had introduced only one minor bug, which I fixed with a single line of code.  There was nothing difficult about the process.<p>I&#x27;ve found refactoring Lisp programs to be more difficult.  When I was writing a prototype of this same application in Lisp (Clojure more specifically), I had a macro to implement a small DSL.  The macro was not particularly complex, although it was non-trivial:  it did some code walking and called some helper functions.  When my DSL grew past a certain size, making changes to its implementation became rather difficult.  Sometimes the compiler would report errors at runtime, but more often than not, things would just stop working in mysterious ways whenever I made a change.  The macro&#x27;s output was also quite different than the kind of code I would write by hand, so debugging was difficult.<p>I&#x27;m not the best Lisp programmer, so I&#x27;m not trying to say that Lisp always makes it hard to change your programs.  But there are cases where Java makes it very easy to change your programs.",1374710457

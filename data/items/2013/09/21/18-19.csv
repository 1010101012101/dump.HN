6423995,comment,6423307,6423307,1,0,sehrope,,,"A lot of folks don&#x27;t realize this but it&#x27;s not just web browsers that you need to worry about. When your app connects over SSL to any service that it&#x27;s consuming you need to be properly authenticating the remote server. For external HTTP requests (ex: to an external REST services) many programming languages/environments piggy back on the host machine&#x27;s list of trusted roots (ie. the same ones that your browser uses) but a lot do not. They may just skip over the authentication piece of the SSL handshake.<p>This is <i>especially</i> true for database drivers. If your database driver includes a &quot;use SSL&quot; flag but you&#x27;re not actually specifying a pre-shared certificate to authenticate the remote server then it&#x27;s probably not authenticating the remote server[1]. Think about that for a second ... How would it?<p>I wrote about this a little while back[2] and gave a talk that went into this in a bit more detail this week (slides should be up next week). The gist of it is that if you don&#x27;t authenticate the remote server (by authenticating its SSL cert) you&#x27;re vulnerable to a MITM attack <i>every</i> time you connect. Not just the first time, <i>every time</i>. With SSH we&#x27;re used to pinning remote host keys the first time you connect but with SSL there&#x27;s no such thing[3] and you have to be careful to handle it properly.<p>[1]: I say &quot;probably&quot; here because it&#x27;s technically possible that your remote server has an SSL certificate that is signed by the same set of trusted CAs that you use for HTTP requests <i>and</i> your DB driver actually validates it but it&#x27;s not likely. Most database SSL certificates are either self-signed or self-signed via a CA signing cert controlled by a DBaaS. For example for RDS, Amazon signs the SSL certificates for all MySQL databases with a single CA signing cert: <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html#MySQL.Concepts.SSLSupport"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_M...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://blog.jackdb.com/post/55178133114/using-self-signed-ssl-certificates-with-jackdb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jackdb.com/post/55178133114/using-self-signed-ss...</a><p>[3]: No reason there couldn&#x27;t be SSL cert pinning and it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve considered for our product. However you can&#x27;t really automate it (you need a user to say &quot;this is okay...&quot;) so we decided to have it be a manual step that you can just click to fetch/import: <a href=""http://blog.jackdb.com/post/55349902000/auto-importing-ssl-certificates-into-jackdb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jackdb.com/post/55349902000/auto-importing-ssl-c...</a>",1379789553

Not only that, but the people who <i>did</i> convert paid for a single postcard instead of bulk credits, obviously, since they wanted to try it out first before spending big bucks. Bulk credits are essential for the business to even have a chance since you need to get your paid users to send (or at least pay for) at least 10 or so postcards for you to break even as I mentioned above.<p>edit: The 10 postcard number here is more of a guess if you assume that by removing the free cards you&#x27;ve increased your overall marketing costs per paid user to offset that cost anyway. That said this model can work better if you assume marketing costs are zero, such as if you get to the top of the app store.

I just know what I need and where I can look it up – Nirenberg for fancy, any basic Differential Analysis text for the others, that Russian book on my shelf for a neat simple proof, Moser&#x27;s for a simple proof and application, the list goes on with 6 or more 7 items. Well, this is actually stretching it a little thin, I could prove the basic differential versions without much trouble, and some functional versions given enough hypotheses.<p>When coding I&#x27;m more or less the same. I know there&#x27;s a Javascript function that returns true or false when matching against a regexp, I just don&#x27;t remember its name. Since it&#x27;s kind of shelved in my mind as regexp test, I just look for this, and it&#x27;s hole in one. Once I learn something I may not remember it exactly, but I have a pretty good &quot;indexed memory&quot; in the fact that I know that piece of knowledge exists and I&#x27;ve seen it, so I only need a few moments to dig it up.<p>Of course, I&#x27;d rather remember all CSS selectors and rules, or most of the Javascript machinery and the Go standard library. But I&#x27;m not doing this every day, so I just use it, every time I do a little more sticks to memory and the rest is easily found. If it got me more than 1 minute to look something up, I&#x27;d stick a big post-it in front of me until it sank, so far I have not needed it.",1379789031

6423932,comment,6423487,6423878,2,0,gfodor,,,"Yeah, the majority of my app&#x27;s revenue is from bulk-credit orders, so people drop $20-40 at a time to buy in bulk. Most of them don&#x27;t use all their credits actually, and I&#x27;d guess this is probably in my favor in the long run vs. getting them to keep coming back since that is essentially all profit. (If credits expire.)<p>Here&#x27;s the thing though. If you assume that you need to give someone a free card, which I&#x27;m all but certain of, it doesn&#x27;t really matter how easy your app is to use, how many features it has, or anything like that. All those things control is your conversion rate of people who get to the point of sending a free card. (In my case, I was getting about 33% conversion rate here, which I think is pretty great.) So, 1 in 3 people who downloaded the app got all the way to the point of sending a free card.<p>The catch is who comes back and spends money? It&#x27;s <i>this</i> conversion rate that determines the fate of the business. You don&#x27;t have a lot of wiggle room here. You can spam them. You can try to improve the design and fullfillment of the cards so they get positive feedback from the recipient. You can give the recipient a way to notify them they enjoyed the card. You can even get people who receive the cards to pay for credits for them. I did all this. But beyond that, what else can you really do to entice users to come back and spend money? This isn&#x27;t about improving the flow of the app, the use cases, qr codes, or whatever, it&#x27;s about taking someone who experienced the product for free to decide to pay for more. It&#x27;s all about sales.<p>There aren&#x27;t many levers here at this point in the funnel, and in my experience <i>this</i> conversion rate I was getting (about 1 out of 8 people) is so low it&#x27;s fairly hopeless when you consider sunk costs for free cards and not to mention marketing costs. You&#x27;ve spent money to send 8 free cards, which came from 24 installs, and you have one person left who is paying you for more. Ballpark you spent about $15-20 to find this one person. The <i>margin</i> on this person&#x27;s purchases needs to pay for this plus server costs, employees, support, etc. Depending on your pricing they&#x27;ll need to send (or buy up front) probably around 10 postcards <i>on average</i> per paid user. You have like no margin of safety here.<p>You&#x27;d really need it to be more like 1 out of 2 or 3 for it to be worth the &quot;lets raise $1m and get to the top of the App Store to reduce marketing costs to zero&quot; case. Also don&#x27;t forget I was in a highly vertical market where there is a real obvious need (grandparents receiving pictures of grandkids.) Good luck to those guys :) The only way I could see it working is if you are at the top of the app store <i>and</i> you leverage the fact that a large % of your credits go unspent, and you can realize this as a profit. This isn&#x27;t a business though, it&#x27;s a ponzi scheme. It might be how Postagram has stayed afloat while they try to make the product solvent.",1379788534

Stallman copied some of the features in Zmacs. Zmacs was one small part of a much larger operating system which, among other things, included industry leading animation software. There were many, many systems (including the hardware architecture itself) that Stallman could not, and did not copy. No company picked an alternative to Lisp Machines simply because it also had something that looked like Zmacs. Your statement is akin to saying that a modern tablet with a web browser makes desktops (which can run much more powerful tools) obsolete.<p>Symbolics got used to selling hardware for tens of thousands of dollars and could not fully adjust when competitors were eventually able to sell machines for much less. The company also had a couple of bad CEOs, and suffered large financial losses because of a series of bad real estate deals. Efforts to port their software to other platforms were largely unsuccessful.<p>Lisp Machines were always a niche market because they were expensive, top-of-the-line machines. The target market never really overlapped with Windows. Cheap workstations that could have multiple users eventually became almost as capable as Lisp Machines and thus displaced them.<p>If you want to credit Stallman with sabotage then mention Elisp, because Elisp is the worst Lisp still in use (Zmacs ran ZetaLisp).",1379787938

They just didn&#x27;t want to take the hit to their pocketbooks and I don&#x27;t blame them.<p>What also happened was the well-connected people were able to make arrangements for their own private supplies of gas, and those people included politicians, business leaders, and other wealthy people, but it was secretive and supply was restricted to them. The politicians were publicly attacking/shaming &quot;scalpers&quot; who were trying to sell gas at a fair price, meanwhile they were secretly making back-room deals for themselves.<p>What&#x27;s the lesson here? Depends on who you ask and what you goals are. Instituting price caps usually results in suppliers losing interest and disappearing, which is probably what happened in Venezuela.<p>Oh, and a black market of gas emerged.

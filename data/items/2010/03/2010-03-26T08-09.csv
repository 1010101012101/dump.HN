Are you happy to have yours scraped?  What's your view on the ethics?<p>I'm asking because I'm aware my site's started to be scraped (by more than search engines), and I'm trying to figure out how I feel about it.  In this case I'm happy because I know the audience/user base is smallish.  If an app went mainstream that did it, I wouldn't be happy.<p>Of course the pragmatic answer is simple - 'build an api' - a few more weekends and I might.<p>But right now I'm interested to hear people's opinions on it.",1269593763

Take National Geographic for instance.<p>One article has a different theme: <a href=""http://www.valeriedaysings.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/national-geographic-article.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.valeriedaysings.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/na...</a><p>from another: <a href=""http://www.simongarnier.com/images/wordpress/ft_hdr.5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simongarnier.com/images/wordpress/ft_hdr.5.jpg</a><p>Well actually, those are title pages, but I've read those articles and I can attest that the different designs set a suitable mood for the topic at hand.<p>I applaud web publishers for taking up this paradigm and applying what publishing graphic designers have been doing for some time. Of course with most methods of design, it depends if the occasion is suitable. Some online publications can do well with a consistent design: <a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/</a><p>While others do well with differing designs, almost as if each posting of their articles is a treat for their readers: <a href=""http://trentwalton.com/articles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trentwalton.com/articles/</a><p>just like D.Curtis does, so good on him if he has inspired others to do the same.",1269593700

Gravitational force is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from a body.<p>The classic gravity analogy is billiard balls sitting on a stretched sheet of plastic. The force of gravity is like the slope of the dents on the plastic - very steep around individual bodies and dropping off quickly after that. So drop something close to any given body and it's going to have a much greater influence than a larger body further away.",1269593278

I'm assuming you've already got something that works for you, but on the assumption that any problem worth mentioning is probably going to bite someone here eventually:<p>1)  Don't try to manage 301s in server configs.  You'll go insane.<p>2)  Make a simple table mapping old URLs to new URLs.  You can update this when you make a change that breaks URLs.<p>3)  If you feel like you want to 404 or 501, and your server is not overloaded (if it is, pfft, let that spider eat a 404 and save resources for real people), check memcached to see if you've resolved this recently.  If not, check the table and set the cache accordingly.  You can then return control to the webserver to serve the cached error page or, alternatively, send the 301 to the proper page.<p>4)  Give the end-user a quick page which returns what URLs are consistently getting 404ed and asks for a best page to 301 them to.  Since that page is behind an admin login, you can make it as expensive as you darn well please -- for example, grepping the heck out of a large log file, goign row by row, and searching for a ""best guess"".  You can let the users approve them with one click.  (Last time I wrote one I put a little forecast of how much of the marketing budget was saved due to the users' diligence in assigning 301s.  Five minutes of work, got me more pats on the back than most project which take 6 months.  Apparently the admin staff was fighting over who got to do the URL corrections every day.)<p>Your users will love you, your database load will be low, your SEO will be awesome, and your crusty ol' sysadmin will not tear out your intestines and use them for a necklace the 47th time you ask for him to add a 301 to the config file.",1269591420

Languages let you abstract away different things and therefor think <i>different kinds</i> of thoughts while programming. Procedures add a whole new dimension to subroutines. OO adds a whole new dimension to procedures. Closures and functional programming add a whole new way to structure thought and code.<p>Would it be a good idea to use C to write a timing routine for a micro controller?

At least it&#x27;s not a fake &quot;book generator&quot; box. If this will be delivered as a PDF, why not use the Acrobat logo below a thumbnail preview of the actual cover/first page? To me, seeing real content lends credibility.<p>* Thin column of text with bullet points.<p>* Periodic bolded keywords.<p>* The only things it&#x27;s missing are a &quot;P.S.&quot; section and a breakdown of the cost savings over the alternatives.<p>I have no doubt that the reason these things are standard is that they work. However, for me the site has the same look and feel I&#x27;ve seen in many low-quality info product kind of sites. As a result, I&#x27;m immediately more skeptical than I otherwise would be.",1370897987
5856838,comment,5854818,5854818,1,0,ilaksh,,,"&quot;Terrorism&quot; is simply the most popular contemporary propaganda used as cover for any type of state overt or covert military action or agenda.  In other words, use of extraordinary force must be justified by circumstances of mythical proportions.  The real reasons for going to war or surveillance of citizenry, like the desire to acquire territory and resource control, or to suppress dissidents or political opposition domestically, are not ethical or marketable.",1370897982

I think it&#x27;s a huge thing for developers.<p>One of the biggest pains I think we face as developers is software fragmentation. So far Apple has done a very good job of having users update versions of iOS and keeping consistent with hardware specifications - it&#x27;s probably one of the top three main drivers for why I develop primarily for iOS (sometimes solely for iOS). I&#x27;m thinking this reinforces that build-for-iOS-first mentality for developers. If the quality of apps is such a large factor in what&#x27;s keep users loyal to the platform, this is an important point.",1370897836

The appeal was twofold: it was a bitchin&#x27;-fast machine you could stuff with as many cards and drives as you want, and it ran OS X.<p>This new design removes the former selling point.  12 core max (same as current)?? Four RAM slots (down from eight)?? 1/6th the volume (i.e. space to plug stuff in)??<p>This offers almost no advantage over a late model iMac with a Thunderbolt-to-PCIe breakout module (which is what many power users have been doing in the years since the last update).",1370897670

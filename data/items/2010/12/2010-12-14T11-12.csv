As my car was recently broken into I did't have a spare (you are not required to carry spare in Czech Republic, but you are legally required to have some way of fixing broken tires, be it spare, quick-fix-kit or road side assistance subscription). So I correctly assumed that quick-fix kit is of no use when you don't have an actual tire to fix and tried to call road side assistance company which I subscribe to that even offers help with tire replacement. They told me that they cannot do anything else than tow my car somewhere (for like an 2 EUR per km, times two, which was out of question assuming I was like 400km from home) and fix the tire in 2 business days, so I canceled my subscription and went to get spare tire by some other means. In the end my girlfriend called her parents who got me spare tire by some networking and fast talking means in like half an hour, you simply got to like rural areas and people who are always ready to help.",1292327484

I had the post a bit longer but I cut it down a bit before publishing and it discussed some points you mentioned.<p>People had reasons to call Rails as something ""magic"" some time ago. But ""magic"" at that time really translated to poor design and lack of documentation.<p>Most of Rails has changed since then. Rails has good documentation for already some time, the internals are cleaner than ever before and should continue improving (for example, check Aaron Patterson's work on Active Record for Rails 3.1). But people still call it magic, because it became an habit.<p>Even simpler and smaller things in Rails, like the ""find_by_email"" method in Active Record that relies on Ruby's method_missing, were for a long time called as ""magic finders"".<p>Another proof of that habit was my take on Inherited Resources. The code is clean, modular, well-tested since day one, but I still stamped ""magic"" on the README when I first released it because it sounded cool. This is the mistake I want to prevent people from doing it all over again.<p>Maybe a better moto would be: ""There is not such thing as magic, only bad and poorly-documented code.""",1292327314

I could understand pretty easily how a ForeignKey works (I don't know, it just clicked), but understanding how a FileField works was hard because the object I was receiving was just a proxy that forwarded all messages to an object that I couldn't figure out how it got instantiated (or the logic behind the decision). And when I did figure out how the thing worked, I puked a little and came up with an inelegant hack for what I was trying to do.<p>Figuring out how stuff works is really useful when you want to extend the provided functionality or work around a bug that has to be fixed RIGHT NOW or break free of those conventions that sometimes are just too limiting. Not to mention incomplete documentation which many times is seriously lacking.<p>Django's source code (when compared to Rails), while also full of conventions, has this neat property that I like: you can read and understand 70% of its source-code (going line-by-line with a debugger) without fully understanding Python's meta-programming capabilities, which makes it really friendly to beginners.<p>I mean, the convention for ""has_many :tags"" is really neat, but such conventions have to have complementaries in the Rails source-code ... i.e. clear conventions for how to find and read the source-code of this mechanism.<p>Fortunately Rails 3 got a major refactoring effort, that I could read portions of it. It's more modular and reader-friendly now: and this is partly because people complained about magic. With a couple of additions here and there, it can be the web framework I've been waiting my whole web-dev carrier :-)",1292324453

It seems subtle, but it had everything:<p>1) Doesn't make any sense.<p>2) Doesn't point to a solution.<p>3) Isn't really an error.<p>4) Completely prevents the computer from working.<p>5) Happened routinely--millions of times a day, I'm sure.<p>6) Seemed to infect pretty girls the most, allowing me to heroicly solve the problem (by ejecting the diskette from the drive during boot up.)<p>Good times.",1197086190

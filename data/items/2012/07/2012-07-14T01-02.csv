4242832,comment,4240007,4242383,3,0,marcamillion,,,"Thank you for your reply also....let's take a step back and go back to the context of what we are talking about.<p>9/11 is the first time that a terrorist attack, of that scale, has hit American shores since Pearl Harbor. For better or worse, it happened on Bush's watch. The fact is, that single action would forever define his presidency. Which president wants to have the ""honor"" of being in charge when the largest terrorist attack in decades strikes the country? What is the #1 role of a president? Commander-in-chief. So before even passing any social legislation, their job is to lead the armed forces and protect the homeland.<p>Now, put yourself in his shoes. Sept 18th, 2001 - after everything has sunk in that 3000+ Americans were killed in NY and the economy is on the precipice. You know, beyond the shadow of a doubt that there are existing threats out there. Dictators and other leaders that have explicitly said they would like to do harm to America.<p>Also consider, that post-9/11, who was being blamed? Bush was. After all, in August 2001, he got a NIE briefing saying that Bin Laden was interested in hijacking commercial airliners and attacking US targets (along with MANY other threat vectors). It so happened that one was accurate. People are blaming him for not doing anything before 9/11, but anyone that understands security will know that it is unreasonable to expect that you can/should follow-up every lead, and address every single rumor/threat. It is literally impossible. Not enough resources.<p>So the question is, now that you know that a) you were warned, b) clearly people are capable of striking, and c) there are people that you know that would love to capitalize on this...do you just sit by and do nothing?<p>Yes, I know the argument can be made that he should have escalated the war in Afghanistan - I agree with that assessment....but the fact of the matter is that for decades, Saddam had WMD (or WMD producing capabilities and the intent to produce weapons). He also has used biological and chemical weapons on his own people no less - and he went to great lengths to mislead UN inspectors about his program. Why did he do that? Because he was afraid of Iran....his REAL enemy.<p>He had to let Iran believe that he had WMD (or those capabilities) to prevent an unprovoked attack.<p>So knowing all of that, having enough evidence that (granted, was not as much as you would want for a declaration of war on the scale of the Iraq war) seems to lead you to believe that Saddam is actually doing what he says he is doing (and not misleading you)...and in the paranoid climate of being fearful that America will be attacked again, it's not hard to see Bush officials 'stretching the truth' - because they would rather be safe than sorry.<p>Also, keep in mind that many other politicians had access to the same evidence and the resolution to go to war had to be passed by both houses of congress. They were [1] by large majorities - 297 Yay, 143 Nay in the House, 77 yay 23 Nay in the Senate. They all had access to the same intelligence briefings that Bush had access to.<p>It's easy for the UN or the Security Council to not vote for such a large action because a) they weren't attacked, and b) it would be costly and politically difficult for them to do. Plus for countries like Saudi Arabia, and Russia, it's bad for business and their exports (oil and gas).<p>So my point is, given the climate...the intelligence community was divided. Some journalists were for, others were against. Policymakers were responsible for ""appearing"" to keep America safe. Knowing full well that Saddam wants to attack America and has WMD...the only thing worse than a 9/11 is a biological/chemical/nuclear attack on American soil.<p>If that ever happened, Bush would never live it down.<p>P.S. I just thought I should point out two things...a) I am an Obama supporter, but I was also a Bush supporter...so be that what it's worth, b) It is hilarious how much Obama bashed Bush for the Iraq war and Gitmo and renditions and all this stuff, and Obama has intensified many of these programmes and increased them. I read somewhere, can't remember where, that in the first few months of Obama's administration he did more drone strikes than the entire 8 years of Bush's presidency. So, as much as he sounded like a ""peacetime"" President - what is clear is that even the most ardent ""anti-war"" candidates, when they get the mantle and realize that THEY (and they alone) will be held responsible for the security of the country...they tend to act differently than their pre-mantle rhetoric would suggest that they act.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Resolution_to_Authorize_the_Use_of_United_States_Armed_Forces_Against_Iraq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Resolution_to_Authorize_t...</a>",1342231135

4242805,comment,4237254,4238178,4,0,lobster_johnson,,,"What I like about camelcase is that it confers the same kind of visual classification to types as to certain other things.<p>Back in the day, I used ObjectPascal, where we used camelcase for everything: function names, variables, types. Borland set an early precedent by prefixing many class types with the letter T, thus to visually distinguish them from other things: So you had TWindow, TButton, etc. This system makes sense when you see it in practice:<p><pre><code>    function GetParent(Window: TWindow): TWindow;
    begin
      ...
</code></pre>
While a bit crude, I feel the same kind of visual differentiation is needed for a language like Rust.<p>Ruby has some syntactic oddities I like precisely because they provide visual classification: ""@"" for instance variables and ""@@"" for class variables:<p><pre><code>    class User
      @@max_name_length = 32

      def initialize(name)
        raise ""Error"" if name.length > @@max_name_length
        @name = name
      end
    end
</code></pre>
The current ""old-style"" Rust code quickly becomes a uniform sea of lowercase to me, as does Stroustrup-style C++. It gets worse due to a quirk of mine to name things verbosely. So instead of variables like ""u"" to represent a user, I spell out ""user"". With all lowercase it gets odd:<p><pre><code>    fn save(user: user) {
      ...
    }
</code></pre>
While Rust have types and variables living in separate namespaces, all-lowercase names introduces the possibility of ambiguity and possibly makes some things impossible in the future, I think; consider:<p><pre><code>    let foo = user.new();
</code></pre>
It looks like a method call ""new()"" on an instance ""user"". But what if you could call methods on types? With the discussion about the ""::"" operator becoming ""."", such a distinction would become impossible without introducing a new operator. With camelcase it becomes obvious what's what:<p><pre><code>    let foo = User.new();</code></pre>",1342230333

But this only works when you have something to loose that's why we are so afraid of fanatics getting their hands on WOMDs, they can't be dissuaded and these treaties have no effect on them.
Today big tech companies amass patents of mass destruction (POMD) to dissuade each other from suing. Unfortunately this doesn't work against patent trolls because they have nothing to lose. So what you are suggesting is a kind of patriot act against the ""technology terrorists"" and start a war against patent trolling! :)",1342229293

4242747,comment,4240138,4240138,2,0,johnmichaeleden,,,"You knew it was bound to happen.  You knew, in your gut, that once David Brooks read Twilight of the Elites (Twilight), hed have some fundamental quibble with Christopher Hayes latest.  (Brooks piece is here:  <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/opinion/brooks-why-our-elites-stink.html?_r=1&nl=todaysheadlines&emc=edit_th_20120713."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/opinion/brooks-why-our-eli...</a>)<p>In Why our Elites Stink, Brooks argues that our elites are failing to live up to a self-conscious leadership code that a now vanquished vanguard once had.  Before we get to whether such a code even makes sense (I think it does, but not in Brooks' sense), consider Brooks general critique of Twilight:<p>Its a challenging argument but wrong. Id say todays meritocratic elites achieve and preserve their status not mainly by being corrupt but mainly by being ambitious and disciplined. They raise their kids in organized families. They spend enormous amounts of money and time on enrichment. They work much longer hours than people down the income scale, driving their kids to piano lessons and then taking part in conference calls from the waiting room.<p>To invoke Seth Meyers from Saturday Night Live, really?  I can see why this complaint might play well with a certain demographic.  After all, successful Americans, especially members of the upper-middle class, do spend an inordinate amount of time shuttling their kids to piano lessons, ensuring that their children gain entry into the best high schools and colleges, and generally putting in serious hours at work.  They also spend a lot of time ensuring that their own work product exceeds the prevailing standards of their respective fields.  They are killing it, I can assure you.  These folks are sweating blood everyday to ensure that they dont lose their place in our economic biosphere, a system that perhaps has less in common with a biological environment  where ecological balance is at least possible  and more with an oil-soaked incline that very much prefers culling over cultivating.<p>What Brooks does not realize is that the elites Hayes has in mind are not the folks killing themselves to excel as line-contributors at management consulting firms, law firms, and technology companies.  Hayes is talking about people who, through a mix of talent, political maneuvering and luck are able to ascend to the top of the mountain and defend it against those (i.e., the line-contributors) who desperately need access to capital and the other resources (political connections, e.g.) to climb further up the mountain.  Yes, I am saying that Brooks has conflated (deliberately?) upper-middle class strivers with the real elite.  And for that reason alone, his direct assault against Twilight fails.<p>But what of Brooks positive argument, the idea that elites today are sorely lacking a code of honor?  Consider Brooks own words:<p>The best of the WASP elites had a stewardship mentality, that they were temporary caretakers of institutions that would span generations. They cruelly ostracized people who did not live up to their codes of gentlemanly conduct and scrupulosity. They were insular and struggled with intimacy, but they did believe in restraint, reticence and service.<p>Todays elite is more talented and open but lacks a self-conscious leadership code. The language of meritocracy (how to succeed) has eclipsed the language of morality (how to be virtuous). Wall Street firms, for example, now hire on the basis of youth and brains, not experience and character. Most of their problems can be traced to this.<p>There is some truthiness here.  It is true that if you read about the Libor scandal, you will get the sense that a bunch of immature brats are now playing skipper atop large vessels that they do not quite comprehend.<p>Yet it is also apparent that Brooks does not understand the preconditions to creating and maintaining a self-conscious code of stewardship and honor.  That code is only possible where a number of preconditions have obtained.  First, wealth and earning disparities between capital and labor have to be reasonable, a point that Hayes repeatedly makes in Twilight.<p>Second, such a code is possible only where the word merit does not mean something like best able to enrich Zeus and his favored demigods.  Brooks in fact touches on this, but only obliquely.  He observes that Wall Street firms . . . now hire on the basis of youth and brains, not experience and character.  Presumably Brooks would agree that experience makes someone truly more meritorious in the world of banking, since experience would inculcate a broad sense of social responsibility.<p>I dont know if this is true of executives in the banking world; its quite possible that senior bankers are just as prone to take huge risks as their younger counterparts, given the willingness of Congress to wash away billion-dollar gaffes through bail outs.  Nonetheless, I would generally agree with Brooks that experience and character are characteristics relevant to a recruiting or hiring decision.  But I digress.  The point here is that merit must actually be something genuine and (wherever and whenever possible) immune from manipulation.  Where such an immunity is impossible, merit must be something that ordinary people can fight to have reinstated, followed or respected within the key institutions that structure and reproduce society over time.<p>Defining genuineness is not easy.  It doesnt mean gauged by standardized tests, which are suspect as tools of exigency and manipulation (see the history of military recruiting, which I think of as the sordid incubator of modern standardized tests).  Ensuring that merit is a genuine concept is simply a way of saying that this word should not become co-opted by an existing regime to justify its own immoral conduct. Put another, perhaps stronger, way: Merit must be defined independently of what happens to be beneficial for the existing elite. Is that hard to do?  Absolutely.  Should we strive to attain this lofty goal?  Without a doubt.<p>The third precondition is related to the second:  There must be mechanisms and institutions in place to prevent Zeus, as well as his favored demigods, from (1) controlling the very definition of merit  though controlling access to key institutions and capital and (2) living a distant life, a life immune to the fears, concerns, and hopes of those who do not live at the top.  In Hayes parlance, we need to dismantle the autocatalytic infrastructure that allows elites to rig the game in their favor.  We need less, not more, social distance.<p>In a nutshell, then, Brooks positive diagnosis fails because he hasnt done any rigorous thinking about the core problem.  Hayes is right:  Its not just that the people in power dont happen to have a code of honor, its that our most important economic and political institutions are architected to reward only those people who are willing to forever flush that code of honor from their psyches.  That dear friends, is, unfortunately, todays price of admission to Mount Olympus.",1342228960

As a result, it's software I can't fully control.<p>And I think that's the same pain-point with most of the Web right now. We can't really evolve our web applications because we don't control them fully; we have to accept the terms of the platform, which tends to be advertising driven, which means they want to constrain the UI.<p>If you're tired of Twitter, you can't direct your Twitter interface to a new service. If you want to add a new feature, you have to build an entirely new interface and hope they never revoke your app's access. If you want to send a private message, you have to share it with their logs.<p>This idea that we're building platforms is insane. Listen to Eben Moglen (founder of Freedom Box) talk about this; you'll enjoy it. As he puts it, a platform is a place that you can't leave. That's our pain point right now. We need services that you choose and web apps that are compatible, not walled gardens. Not for our applications, anyway.<p>So losing the advertising model has a pretty distinct advantage: it gets us away from the platform model, where they have to control the way you access the service so they can deliver the ads.

You say<p>><i>You can start your own website today much easier than it was to publish a pamphlet in the 18th century.</i><p>Then you go on to say,<p>><i>We need Facebook, Google+, Twitter, we need independent ""appstores"" (a definite advantage of Android platform), we need niche sites like HN,</i><p>These are not logically consistent. Do we need blogs or do we need big companies to allow big free speech? Are you saying we need both? But if we hypothetically get big companies legally responsible for allowing free speech why will be need independent sites? I am not sure what you mean here.<p>><i>We should absolutely pressure and shame companies who make those questionable decisions and unnecessarily restrict their customers but more importantly we need to stick to open networks where news and information flow independently through different providers.</i><p>Sure thing. Pressure them, but be aware that they are not _legally_ responsible for anything. That is why I said that we need a charter for all companies to sign so there is a framework where the law fails.<p>We are saying the same thing (at least from the way I understand, yours is not a clear argument to understand).<p>I am proposing a concrete action items to the premises you are making.

I would definitely be more convinced by a great-but-buggy prototype than a video of someone looking off in to the distance. I don't mean that as a jab: it's symbolically kind of unsettling. You're talking about how much the community matters, but you're talking to someone else.<p>To me, the proposed project touches on a much bigger issue of how Twitter is a part of the internet infrastructure. Real time messaging has become really important, and there's some anxiety around how that infrastructure can be a part of the web in some trusted way.<p>Simply making Twitter community supported doesn't appear to me to be the best decision. We've learned about some great potential from Twitter, and I'm much more excited about something fully decentralized than I am interested in a community supported Twitter clone.",1342227693

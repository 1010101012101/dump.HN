It&#x27;s certainly possible that the same metric could be both (1) foolish to optimize and (2) a reliable indicator of success.<p>Think of yourself trying to solve a maze -- because there are cul-de-sacs, if you took the naive strategy of directly minimizing distance to the goal, you&#x27;ll just become stuck in a dead end. Yet if you do reach the goal (by another means) the distance will still be minimal (zero). This is basically the concept of local optima in optimization.<p>Of course, there are other situations, where through careless optimization a measure can become entirely disconnected from the holistic concept it is designed to encourage. Think for example of using &quot;lines of code&quot; as a heuristic for programmer productivity; I could unroll loops to maximize that measure and achieve a much higher value than the most truly productive programmer.<p>So the question is whether long-term shareholder value is of the first or second type.

Ford Motor Company was a 1919 decision of the Michigan Supreme Court. The opinion’s status as a meaningful legal precedent on the issue of corporate purpose is tenuous at best. Yet, its facts “are familiar to virtually every student who has taken a course in corporate law.” As Stout has observed in the past, “[t]he case is old, it hails from a state court that plays only a marginal role in the corporate law arena, and it involves a conflict between controlling and minority shareholders” more than an issue of corporate purpose generally. The chapter explains quite well that any idea that corporate law, as a positive matter, affirmatively requires companies to maximize shareholder wealth turns out to be spurious. In fact, none of the three sources of corporate law (internal corporate law, state statutes and judicial opinions) expressly require shareholder primacy as most typically describe it. To the contrary, through the routine application of the business judgment rule, courts regularly provide prophylactic protection for the informed and non-conflicted decisions of corporate boards&quot;<p>[1] &quot;The Shareholder Value Myth: How Putting Shareholders First Harms Investors, Corporations, and the Public&quot; by Lynn Stout <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Shareholder-Value-Myth-Shareholders/dp/1605098132"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Shareholder-Value-Myth-Sharehold...</a>

8710139,comment,8704629,8707728,0,0,makewavesnotwar,,,">> Does the javascript decoder download the images, or does the browser do that, then the javascript simply decode it?<p>Right now, it would appear that the with a hard reload of the demo: <a href=""http://bellard.org/bpg/lena.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bellard.org/bpg/lena.html</a> on chromium, the BPG images are initially loaded with the page, then the posts.js file scans through the page&#x27;s images to find the ones who&#x27;s src ends in &#x27;.bpg&#x27;, then posts.js re-downloads the same files with ajax, which are then decoded to PNG files rendered in canvas tags with no identifying information.<p>The extra request to re-download images is unnecessary but easily removed to just process the data loaded with the initial page load.<p>>> Can CSS reference them without javascript changing the styles?<p>Not from what I can see. The images are being rendered to canvas elements without any identifying information. The decoder will need to be modified to add identifying id&#x27;s or classes. This again is an easy fix.<p>>> Can they be cached locally if downloaded directly?<p>This is what I perceive to be an issue. Try downloading the image rendered to the 5kb bpg example... The image that is being rendered is a 427.5kb PNG and that&#x27;s for a 512x512 image size.<p>PNGs aren&#x27;t lossy... so any difference in file size is going to be the product of rendering size or how much the bpg compression has simplified the source image. ( I&#x27;m guessing the file size follows something like a logarithmic curve where it jumps initially based on rendered image dimensions and then approaches a limit as the compression approaches lossless. )<p>Because of the rendered out PNGs&#x27; large file size, I would expect that if you are rendering out large images or a lot of images, you would definitely use more resources than with comparable quality JPGs regardless of whether you cache the BPGs for rendering and you would indeed experience the drawbacks you mentioned in both memory and page-load time.<p>That being said, this is a cool idea, an incredible proof of concept and I&#x27;m very thankful to Fabrice for putting it out there.",1417898811

The point being that the dispossessed majority rose up and overthrew their seemingly entrenched overlords, and that by analogy the disenfranchised poor of the world would rise up and overthrow the then global powers (USA & USSR) of the cold war.<p>Now academic revolutionary theory had already moved on by the time he wrote that (revolutions like the French or American are clearly the revolutions of the upper middle classes, and even the major communist revolutions of Russia and China were instigated and lead by upper middle class bourgeois who used the poor to help achieve their own ends).  But the simplistic marxist view of class struggle was still popular in the press and much of the populace (and was still considered legit in academic settings too until the 90s).<p>Now as a kid/teenager during the cold war I spend part of my life in India (famously non-aligned; Nehru even foolishly turned down a seat at the security council to make this point) and France and the origins and implications of the term were important parts of how geopolitics was viewed.  However in the States, all the context is stripped out rendering the analogy simplistic at best and ultimately not really formative (we already know that there are poor countries -- simply using a new name adds no value).  In fact even today I look at my kid&#x27;s high school american history textbook (stops and rummages in kid&#x27;s backpack to confirm) and even in <i>American</i> history it seems most of the context has been stripped out.

I do not believe that functional programming benefits from brevity, except at the top layer. Unfortunately, functional programmers often expand their equations which, having examined them thoroughly, they understand implicitly, but can give too much information to the reader all at once.<p>Though, I have to agree, the FP community really hasn&#x27;t been able to demonstrate how to do it without losing efficiency, and yet many proponents claim we should abandon all other paradigms.

It was never a technical failure, just overestimation of potential market size (same will happen to SpaceX reusability plans i believe).<p>My main point was that overall USAF expenses are pretty high, whatever aircraft are in use.

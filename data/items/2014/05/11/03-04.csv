7727712,comment,7726923,7727681,0,0,aaronem,,,"> What cements the case as being meaningless in my mind is the fact that they were not ordered to strengthen their cups or to brew at a lower temperature.<p>And if such sanctions had been within the ambit of the jury empaneled, in a civil case, to consider the damages specifically due Stella Liebeck as remedy for her injuries, this statement might actually mean something.<p>You know, you&#x27;ve got this hilarious sort of completely unintentional doublethink going on that I just can&#x27;t get enough of. I mean, on the one hand, you&#x27;re tossing off all the slippery-slope-to-the-nanny-state clichés which are so depressingly common in arguments over this very case -- and on the other hand, you&#x27;re blithely implying that the very same jury, which you hold in such thinly veiled contempt for having found differently from how you believe you would have in their position, should have had the power not merely to award monetary damages to Ms. Liebeck as they did, but should <i>also</i> have had nigh-untrammeled power to regulate the operations of a world-spanning corporation in whatever fashion they saw fit.<p>There&#x27;s a certain essential irreconcilability in these opinions which I think you haven&#x27;t yet noticed. Did the jury have too much power, or too little? Is the state too nanny, or not nanny enough? It can&#x27;t be both. Make up your mind!",1399780642

Your analogies don&#x27;t reflect what actually happened, which is why you can&#x27;t understand it.<p>Liebeck was hospitalized for 8 days with multiple skin grafts.  She asked asked McDonalds for medical expenses from the injury from the coffee and lost wages (<20k).  McDonalds offered $800.<p>At that point she got an attorney.  They tried to settle.  McDonalds refused.  In the trial it came out that McDonalds had more than 700 reports of medical injuries from the coffee that they were aware of.  Their internal quality control manager reported that they recognized that they were posing a burn hazard to customers with the heat of their coffee, but that it was a minor concern that they were unwilling to adjust.<p>McDonalds admitted that not only were they burning customers who drank the coffee straight from the cup, many of whom needed medical treatment, but that this was something they were unwilling to change.<p>That&#x27;s why the jury hit McDonalds with punitive damages of the profits of two day&#x27;s sales of coffee (which the judge reduced).  Through the whole process McDonalds was acting like a criminally negligent bully unconcerned with injuring customers.  Punitive damages did correct this.",1399780379

7727693,comment,7726923,7727635,4,0,stuki,,,"Any coffee heated to the point where it is still drinkable at the end of a 20 minute commute, will be hot enough to kill if poured straight down your throat in one gulp. It is up to the customer to have some sort of clue.<p>I am pretty sure that when granny makes coffee herself at home, she makes it at least as hot as McDonalds serves it. Whistling kettles and all.<p>In a country of millions of people doing stuff, sometimes the stars align wrong for someone, and they get hurt. It doesn&#x27;t have to, and in fact rarely is, someones &quot;fault.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t granny&#x27;s &quot;fault&quot; that this one time she fumbled the lid and spilled coffee. Given enough tries, sooner or later anyone would, as it is a positive probability outcome. But neither is the probability of it happening large enough to say McDonald&#x27;s was &quot;at fault&quot; of something. Stuff happens. Sometimes nice stuff, sometime less so. No need to feed a lawyer army either way.<p>It&#x27;s the same silly obsession with finding who&#x27;s &quot;at fault&quot; that underpins the enormously inefficient (except for, again, for lawyers) &quot;at fault&quot; car accident insurance schemes in place in most states. Despite most accidents and other mishaps being the result of all manners of complicated, best modeled as random, factors. None of which are a specific party&#x27;s &quot;fault.&quot;<p>But of course, there&#x27;s the old adage about most people ending up in law school, do so because they couldn&#x27;t hack math well enough to ever get into the complex systems classes....:)",1399780051

7727670,comment,7726177,7727278,6,0,shawnreilly,,,"I think this comment is quite misleading. Your average IT Security Group within an organization is not a &#x27;miniature NSA group&#x27;. The difference is where Data is collected and monitored.<p>Your average IT Security Group is focused on their own Internal network. This includes all Internal and External Traffic/Communication going to/From the Internal Network. The reality is, most Security Threats come from an internal source [1]. So yes, your average IT Security Group is interested in monitoring, analyzing, and sometimes dropping internal Traffic. This allows the Organization to track and respond to Data Breaches and Security Incidents. The overall insinuation of this comment seems to be that this is Evil and a Violation of your Privacy (Spying!). But if you&#x27;ve ever worked with (or used Services provided by) any Organization that has a handle on Security, you&#x27;ve likely signed a User Agreement Form (or similar), which clearly states what is going on. So nothing is hidden, and when you think about it, this is a logical reaction to the realities of Security in today&#x27;s Digital Age. If you can&#x27;t trust people, then it makes sense to implement checks and balances. Instead of thinking about it from the perspective is a User, think about it from the perspective of a Service Provider, and it makes a lot more sense. If you think this is Unjust, then the solution is simple. Provide your own services and control your own Destiny.<p>A &#x27;miniature NSA group&#x27; is (presumably) focused on External Networks and External Data Sources. And I say presumably because it is not really clear what you mean by &#x27;miniature NSA group&#x27;, but the insinuation is clear. So this is very different from your average IT Security Group, and it is not correct to insinuate that they are one and the same.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.itproportal.com/2013/10/15/security-experts-no-surprise-that-insiders-are-no1-cause-of-breaches/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itproportal.com/2013/10/15/security-experts-no-su...</a>",1399779596

If you&#x27;re the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company bidding on another company worth several hundred million, you&#x27;re going to have questions and requests every step of the way.  Investment bankers have to respond to those requests in real time.<p>Because of the dynamic nature of these deals, 2 people working 40 hours per week is less productive than 1 person doing 80.

The incremental communication (and potential for miscommunication) that would occur between 2 40 hour workers simply wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>A few big deals per year is what you see - they only get paid when a deal goes through.

So in a situation where someone is hurt in an accident by another driver then sues for medical expenses, the jury is not told that the medical expenses (are often) already paid for by the carriers. They&#x27;re also not told that, no matter how much money they award, if it falls under the civil caps on awards (in Texas) that the judge will automatically lower their award after they leave the court room.<p>I agree with most of those points. Yes, the jury does not know them, and that effects their decisions. Knowing those things would also effect their decisions. Because that&#x27;s how decisions work. Therefore, the stance you must take is, which scenario will yield results which are more appropriate?<p>I assume the jury is also not told whether the defendant has liability insurance against the results of the very case being deliberated either, which is a point just as salient.

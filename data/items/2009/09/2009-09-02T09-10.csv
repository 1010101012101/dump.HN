I don't think Wikipedia needs to take steps to counteract anything in this regard because it's not doing anything to hamper women from participating.<p>Also, the %'s don't really matter as long as the content is good.  It's not like women are at a disadvantage because they don't have enough Wikipedia editors.",1251885584

Suffice it to say that the Australian AIM9 was modified to work a bit better than the standard AIM9 when in an enhanced environment (access to other radar system information in the local area etc).  They weren't particularly short-range missiles, but the F-16s had stand-off range on them.  I'm assuming that is why they chose AMRAAM as their armament for that encounter, because I know they use AIM9s elsewhere on their F16s...<p>Anyway, this story is about 12 years out of date now :-/  But I'm sure the technological gap between the US and the rest of the world still exists - it was after all Rummy's hobby horse.",1251884028

There it is defined that tags are case insensitive, BR is always empty, you don't need to close TD and P etc...<p>XML on the other hand has this stric notion of well-formedness where you can parse any well-formed document without a DTD or schema. This is what allows you to more easily invent your own tags and attach a style to them.<p>Thus, with sticking with an SGML based language, HTML made a decision to make the authoring of the core language more convenient while sacrificing some of the benefits that XML would have had. It's a design decision and it has been debated a lot already. It's just something people should keep in mind.",1251882963

Some people misleadingly refer to the Standards mode as “strict parsing mode”, which is misunderstood to imply that browsers enforced HTML syntax rules and that a browser could be used to assess the correctness of markup. This is not the case. The browsers do tag soup fix-ups even when the Standards mode layout is in effect. (In 2000 before Netscape 6 was released, Mozilla actually had parser modes that enforced HTML syntax rules.

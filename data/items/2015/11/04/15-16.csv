I was mainly interested in the technology so I picked a few features for an MVP and started coding.<p>I launched the app a couple of weeks ago, and bought some ads to see if it gets any attention. The landing page isn&#x27;t optimized, and it looks rough at this time, so it didn&#x27;t get any paying customers. As I was considering different ways of marketing it, I found the typical tasks too menial or daunting, and realized I don&#x27;t have enough passion/drive to actually run the SaaS as a side business.<p>I even tried listing it on Flippa, hoping an interested folk might find it interesting and take over. It got some attention there, but since this service is in a low-margin commodity market and there were a couple of more mature similar websites, none of the prospects placed a bid.<p>Now, my question is what would you do if you were in my shoes? Do you think it&#x27;s worth giving a shot? Should I open-source and write about it to get some technical credit out of it?

Or are they cheering because -- gosh darnit -- being on a team is fun. Do you think the children in the Robbers Cave Experiment were masterminds of political intrigue?

This phenomenon has been documented by a number of studies. Capitalist oligarchy is the correct term to refer to the system of government of the US. The public is disgruntled about the perceived change from democracy to this new despotic system.<p>Class warfare against the rich is now a concept because most of the country lost the last round of class warfare around the time the economic depression started, in which the rich got far richer while everyone else got poorer. Whether this is a great struggle for rights or not is unclear, but based off of the last Gilded Age, it will be glossed over in the history books such that people do not understand that change can be effected under certain circumstances.<p>We have a bevy of great causes, but for the most part, our empowerment to affect changes in service of those causes has been nullified. We are disenfranchised, and disgruntled. That we live in relative comfort is no relief; we feel excluded from the making of our own society, and it is a serious problem. This exclusion needs to change first before the other issues can be pursued.

It sounds along the same lines as people describing Go as almost a scripting language, or comparing it to them.  Neither Go nor D seem especially dynamic, both have compilers for reference implementations, both look more like C than Python. (To my eyes at least; I&#x27;ve never tried either one.  Thus this question.)<p>Is it primarily the speed of the compilers?  Both DMD and g6/g7/g8 boast very fast compiles, and Go uses somewhat script-y tools...  but #!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run hasn&#x27;t changed C&#x27;s reputation.  Fast compiling and memory safety, maybe?",1446651303

Other fundamental problems that began at the start of the 20th century have re-emerged under Obama: racial segregation abetted by a criminal justice system that is the New Jim Crow; anti-immigration nativism, which has hardly been helped by an immigration policy whose only achievement is a record number of deportations.

I&#x27;m not entirely sure either.<p>The most immediate implication is that it simply invalidates a great deal of present future-cost/future-value analysis, by noting that the entire present price and cost regime is severely faulty. It may well be that money is the wrong unit of economic analysis. There are a number of people who&#x27;ve suggested that currency should be considered to be backed in energy (though that&#x27;s not the same as saying money <i>is</i> energy -- a crucial but nuanced distinction) -- Arthur C. Clarke, Kim Stanley Robinson, and F. Buckminster Fuller among them. I&#x27;ve traced the concept back to H.G. Wells (of whom Clarke was a fan).<p>Which would suggest that an energy flows model of an economy is of interest, and that for the nuclear instance, you&#x27;d want to sort that out based on total available nuclear energy, conversions for provisioning synthesised hydrocarbons (or other fuels, though CH chains are awfully appealing), and how much net free energy (for other activities) you&#x27;re left with. Plus factors for risk and such.<p>That could be compared with the models for renewables-based alternatives.<p>A key benefit to most renewables schemes is that they pose relatively few widespread catastrophic systemic risks. Grid stability seem the main issue if we&#x27;re still talking electrical systems (and the advantages of electricity are such that we almost certainly are). But solar and wind plants don&#x27;t suddenly go into catastrophic meltdown, and the tech stack for each is relatively small.<p>(Hydro power <i>can</i> see regional catastrophic failure, see the Banqiao Dam disaster, 170k killed. But a lot of things had to go wrong, most of which aren&#x27;t significantly different from what can befall a nuclear site, and the long-term consequences are fairly benign: the region is now home to 7+ million people, 40 years on.)<p>But, answering your question in part: it seems to me that a combined measure of <i>net free energy</i>, and <i>systemic risk</i> is probably a better assessment criteria than some putative present &quot;cost&quot; analysis based on a flawed pricing system.",1446650203

We&#x27;ve had instances in the past where we discussed future plans and due to unforeseen issues couldn&#x27;t follow through with them.<p>The mantra is more &quot;under promise and over deliver&quot; when it comes to these types of things. One of the sayings that has lived long in AgileBits (at least since I&#x27;ve joined nearly 4 years ago) is that no decision is ever final. So we might tell someone &quot;nope, sorry won&#x27;t happen&quot; but then it could later, or vice versa.<p>So, future plans are something we try very hard not to discuss, and if they&#x27;re ever discussed it&#x27;s often by our CEO or founders :)<p>It&#x27;s because we respect our customers that we do this. We don&#x27;t want to lead someone on or misrepresent our intentions. Though, I can certainly understand how it might feel like we are avoiding the issue, we&#x27;re not, we&#x27;d love nothing more than to tell everyone &quot;yup, that&#x27;s coming!&quot; but reality is much different so we want to make sure we do our best by coming in level headed about things.<p>Hope that helps explain things a little at least.<p>Kyle<p>AgileBits",1446649817

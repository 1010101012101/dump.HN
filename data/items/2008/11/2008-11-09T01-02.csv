357979,comment,357856,357949,0,0,mixmax,,,"I see your points, and what your goals are with this, but I think that you and Cuban are getting in on the wrong level.<p>He wants to make sure that tech entrepreneurs are heard in the new government - which I certainly agree is a good idea. Both for the entrepreneurs and the economy. My grudge with the post is that he finds it perfectly reasonable that tech entrepreneurs should be represented at the very top level of the economic advisers to the president. My argument is that the tech entrepreneur expertise should be represented one level further down. Both because, as I've argued before, that the expertise that's needed is very different from doing startups, but also because tech startups don't account for that large a portion of the overall economy. Cuban's arguments could just as well be applied to mom and pop stores, which are probably more underpinning of the economy than startups, the biotech sector, the defense industry, the automobile industry, agriculture, advertising, aerospace, big oil, clean energy, food products etc. etc. These are all important, but none of them, including startups, are big enough in an economical sense that they should be represented at the top level.<p>Yes, an argument could be made that startups are the future of America. But the same argument could be made of mom and pop stores, clean energy and many others.",1226195324

Rather ingenious on this part, too.<p>While the ""accomplices"" were innocent in this case, it makes me wonder whether ""crowd-crime"" will become common in future. Rather like flashmobs, 30 criminals could easily co-ordinate a mass shoplifting operation and the sheer numbers would overwhelm (and even intimidate) any security that was present. I read a story a year or two ago about gangs of hundreds of poor children robbing tourists on beaches somewhat along these lines.",1226194980

Ultimately, the only way to know for sure is to bring it to market.<p>Measuring sign-ups on landing pages from Adwords did not (in the cases I observed) live up to its promise as a short-cut in this process, for the reasons cited.<p>Edit: I certainly believe in adapting what one's doing in response to market evidence - e.g. listening to one's customers - rather than stubbornly assuming that one knows what people want. That, however, is not the point of the OP.",1226192639
357953,comment,357674,357869,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think you're expecting too much from this method. This is a means of checking the pulse of the market. When you approach an injured person to give them first aid, checking their pulse is one of the first things you do. If they don't have a pulse you take appropriate action. But if they do have a pulse, you don't continue checking the pulse again and again, using ever-more-sophisticated pulse-testing technologies. The quality of a paramedic's care is not proportional to how precisely and accurately she can measure your pulse.<p>This test might tell you whether your marketing is going to be very difficult. If you can't get anyone to <i>click on a teaser</i> for your product you've obviously got a problem, and you might want to refine your pitch a bit before doing anything else. Or at least make a plan that involves a relatively long, slow, profitless period during which you shop your minimalist prototype to people and try to build word of mouth.<p>You're right that the <i>real</i> size of your market is hard to estimate with this technique. Tim Ferriss goes so far as to recommend that you take potential customers' emails [1] before putting up the screen that clearly informs them, with great sorrow, that you're ""out of stock"" and offering to email them when you've got product to ship. I think he's right that this is the only way to be sure that the rubberneckers on your website are actual potential customers, but I'm not sure I'd go so far as to do this. (Even though it looks, to my surprise, like the FTC would condone it if you used the right fine print...) And I'm pretty sure it wouldn't work for software. People don't pay for software unless <i>someone</i> has reviewed it. They're not fools.<p>As for the fact that this model is ""mechanistic""... That's why it's a useful spiritual exercise. The tendency to fall in love with your first idea is strong, and the tendency to build the thing that most inspires you -- as opposed to the thing that will cause customers to give you money -- is strong. But it's often easier to make a profitable thing lovable than the other way around.<p>[1] <i>I originally stated, in this post, that Ferriss recommended taking down credit card numbers as well. After looking closely at this part of his book, this turns out not to be true. The fine print matters a lot in cases like this, so I'm sorry for the mistake.</i>",1226192614

Paying tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for such knowledge seems wasteful.<p>I have also read articles in the past indicating that there is no correlation at all between corporation performance and whether or not top executives have MBA degrees.",1226192461

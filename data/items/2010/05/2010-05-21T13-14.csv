1367310,comment,1367128,1367128,0,0,jsz0,,,"I'm skeptical also. Do people really want a search driven TV experience? TV is the opposite of the Internet in many ways. I think people want content pushed at them or presented in a buffet style interface. From the demo video Google TV looks to be <i>very</i> focused on search instead. The other thing that made me skeptical was Google presenting the problem of a program being on multiple channels. My cruddy cable DVR was able to figure this out years ago. TIVO has always done a very good job at it. What's the problem there?",1274450344

Adobe pays the licensing fee for using H264 . Adobe has released enough code and specification to let anyone build a flash playing software. Completely open sourcing Flash Player wont be possible unless H264 is open and patent free. 
So if Apple really wants, they can build their own Flash Player without Adobe's approval.<p>src: <a href=""http://blogs.adobe.com/open/2010/02/following_the_open_trail.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.adobe.com/open/2010/02/following_the_open_trail...</a>",1274450218

Doesn't have to be helpful to anyone, or even remotely sane.  Just something you are excited as hell about doing.  Hackathons are meant to be fun.<p>Club Mate is great for staying awake.  Guarana ( Antarctica ) is also great.  Coffee, and Jolt are acceptable as well.<p>Have some munchies.  When that dead zone around 3-4 am hits it's good to just munch on some m&ms or twizzlers.  The chewing is monotonous and helps you concentrate, and the act keeps you alert and awake.<p>Bring headphones.  There might be times that call for a long coding stretch, and you don't want to be disturbed.  Throw on some brainless monotonous music ( such as trance or drum and base ).  It'll help you tunnel vision.<p>Don't be afraid to screw up.  You don't have to leave successful.  Try to, but don't give up on an ambitious plan just to be on the safe side.  Hell you can always finish it up a few days later and still have something awesome to show off.<p>If you finish early, or during meals / breaks... talk to other people.  Tell them what you are doing, ask what they are doing.  You never know you might end up recruiting someone who can help, or tying two projects together... or just making a good friend.<p>And remember, chicks dig hardware hackers.

It might even be a mild form of Aspergers that hasn't been diagnosed.<p>I myself have a problem with the ""crunchiness"" of vegetables and can't eat them. I've tried to overcome it but my throat closes up when I feel the texture and know that I'm eating it.<p>So I can't eat vegetables. I joke around that I'm a meatarian since I eat everything but vegetables (defined as exclusive, since vegetarians are people who eat anything but meat, also exclusive). But it's not really a joke.<p>As a consequence I've had to make sure I'm eating healthy with this extra restriction. I used to do what they did and just eat what I like and take a supplement plus 1000mg of vitamin c. But I've changed and now eat lots of fruit and no snack food.

1367286,comment,1366706,1366851,0,0,by,,,"In a gas the molecules are moving around with lots of space between them without much interaction. Some quickly, some slowly, all in different directions. Occasionally they collide and bounce off each other, or more rarely they may temporarily form weak (liquid) bonds with each other until a fast molecule hits them and breaks them apart.<p>In a liquid the molecules (which are indistinguishable from gas molecules of course if you looked at them individually) are moving much slower and form and re-form weak (liquid) bonds with the molecules near them. But still there are some moving faster and others more slowly and they are going in random directions.<p>Now think about the surface where the liquid meets the gas. There are some gas molecules that plunge into the liquid and become part of the liquid and there are some liquid molecules moving fast enough to escape from the liquid, breaking all their weak (liquid) bonds, and become part of the gas. The liquid surface at a molecular scale will not be a nice flat surface. It will be a complex seething bubbling thing with droplets and molecules leaving and rejoining the liquid. If we heat the liquid, make the molecules move faster, more of them will be moving fast enough to escape from the liquid. Anyway, if there are more molecules going from the gas to the liquid we say the gas is condensing, and if there are more going the other way the liquid is evaporating. Now think what would happen if we take away all the gas molecules - put the liquid into a vacuum. There will no molecules returning to the liquid, only liquid molecules becoming gas. Conversely, if we compressed the gas above the liquid we would get more gas molecules going into the liquid.<p>I think that's how it works.",1274449900

However, that license is instantly revoked if you take any action against a VP8 user.  I'm guessing that On2 might have a patent library to potentially defend against MPEG-LA.  I'm guessing that Google had highly qualified patent attorneys go over VP8 before buying On2 (and Google's Mike Jazayeri says, ""We have done a pretty thorough analysis of VP8 and On2 Technologies prior to the acquisition"").<p>VP8 is a huge threat to H.264.  Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, and Opera have instantly committed to it for HTML5 video.  If MPEG-LA fails against it, Apple will likely come on board as well since it's an open technology (vs. Flash which is closed) and the fact that chip makers look like they'll implement it (Broadcomm has already committed for its mobile chips).  So, MPEG-LA is clearly going to fight against it.  Theora was more of a curiosity (no offense intended)* - an older video codec (based on VP3, IIRC) that didn't have the support of major companies or chipset makers. VP8 is being pushed hard by heavyweights.<p>Google is not indemnifying users of VP8, but they're going to defend it.  I'm sure Google has a decent patent library that they'd be more than happy to use to strike against not just MPEG-LA, but also its constituent members.  It's important to remember that a corporation is made up of shareholders.  If Google has a patent that many shareholders infringe on, they can strike at those shareholders to get them to pressure MPEG-LA not to go after VP8.  Shareholders ultimately control companies including MPEG-LA.  I'm sure Google could make life more difficult for those shareholders.<p>*The Theora developers have done an awesome job, but they're working from a base specification that's, well, old.",1274447283

My concern, however, is that we get in the habit of excusing these failures because of this incompetence.<p>Software can be made (more) secure and can be tested (better). The point then is when does it make financial sense for facebook to put the money and man power into tackling these issues on the front end... If users / consumers don't take note of the problems and move to another (currently nonexistent) platform facebook will never have a motivating reason to change.<p>Perhaps, users have done this to themselves by demanding low cost (free) software with fast release schedules for new features.",1274447006

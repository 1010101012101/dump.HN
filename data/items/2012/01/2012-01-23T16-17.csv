Going to bed at 7pm implies you require 10 hours sleep/night (allowing 30mins to fall asleep) which is <i>way</i> off at one end of the bell curve. For many people, who require 7-8 hours/night, you should be able to go to bed between 9-10pm. Realistically, what do most people do between 9pm and their normal ""going to bed"" time on most nights? Something productive? Or watch TV?",1327337994

3501067,comment,3500618,3500618,2,0,jballanc,,,"Bear with me here, but it seems to me like this is a good argument for socialism.<p>Consider: why do termination fees exist? Clearly, as America was being wired with telephone service, the cost to run lines to rural areas was prohibitively expensive. So what's the capitalist/Randian thing to do? Well, charge more for phone service out there. If people can't afford it, then they'll move to where it is cheaper to have a phone line, right?<p>Except you have to consider <i>why</i> people would live in these rural areas to begin with. For a large number of individuals, they are probably farmers (or involved in food production). If they have to pay higher rates for phone lines, then they would have to raise the price of food to make living in rural areas viable. But there's obviously a <i>really big</i> incentive to the government and everyone that's not living in rural areas to <i>not</i> have the cost of food increase. So what does America do?<p>To remain somewhat loyal to pristine capitalist ideas, America decides that it's going to let competition and corporate interests resolve the issue, but to make things ""fair"", the government will put its finger on the scales, just a bit. Unfortunately, when you forget to take your finger off the scales, then you end up with AT&T spending $250mil unnecessarily!<p>Efficiency of the market, eh?<p>Of course, a more socialist-leaning country would've just had the government pay to install rural phone lines.",1327337921

The main opinion says<p>> The first case, Knotts, upheld against Fourth Amendment challenge the use of a beeper that had been placed in a container of chloroform, allowing law enforcement to monitor the location of the container. 460 U. S., at 278.  We said that there had been no infringement of Knotts reasonable expectation of privacy since the information obtainedthe location of the automobile carrying the container on public roads, and the location of the off-loaded container in open fields near Knotts cabinhad been voluntarily conveyed to the public.6 Id., at 281282.  But as we have discussed, the Katz reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been  added to, not substituted for, the common-law trespassory test.  The holding in  Knotts  addressed only the former, since the
latter was not at issue.  The beeper had been placed in
the container before it came into Knotts possession, with
the consent of the then-owner.  460 U. S., at 278.  Knotts 
did not challenge that installation, and we specifically de- 
clined to consider its effect on the Fourth Amendment 
analysis.  Id., at 279, n.   Knotts  would be relevant, perhaps, if the Government were making the argument that
what would otherwise be an unconstitutional search is 
not such where it produces only public information.  The 
Government does not make that argument, and we know
of no case that would support it.<p>To me, that says that Knotts is distinguised because all the data that the police used was available publicly, i.e. that Knotts did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy (which, presumably, Jones did in the recent case).",1327337621

The FBI was involved, they followed this guy around for a month, they used expensive technology, they appealed all the way to the Supreme Court .. if they're going through all that trouble, would it have been that much more work to just get a warrant first?  Is there a long waiting list for warrant hearings?  Would the warrant have been unlikely to have been granted?  Or did they just screw up?",1327337221

Larry David has made north of $800 million off of Seinfeld. David E. Kelley is worth somewhere in the range of $250 to $300 million, and Steven Bochco is close to $200 million. The late Aaron Spelling was worth about $300 million, as well.<p>Of course, the days of such lucrative syndication and residual deals are probably numbered. My prediction is that, as content distribution opens up, TV writers will find it easier to become a millionaire, but harder to become a quasi-billionaire. We're entering a world in which there will be fewer Larry Davids, but more Matthew Weiners. Either way, TV writing will continue to be very lucrative at the top of the field.<p>And the path to the top may get shorter. The days of paying dues for 10 years at the staff/producer level before having enough juice to sell an original series are relics of the network TV business as it currently exists and has existed; the democratization of distribution, and the hunger of new distributors for original content, will open up the field to younger writers. More and more young writers will get their start shooting spec pilots or series, too, and not just trying to get staffed on existing shows. It's not unheard of, this day and age, to make a name for oneself on the internet and then get drafted by Hollywood. Look at Andy Samberg and his Lonely Island cohort, for instance.",1327337182

3500996,comment,3500459,3500459,79,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. Oracle has stepped into a bear-trap in this case and is trying to extricate itself. This does not mean that it has a losing case on the merits. That is a matter yet to be decided and it will get as fair a trial in this court as it would anywhere else. Given the nature of its claims, and the murky standards associated with its patent and copyright claims, it likely will get some damage award. But Oracle does not want just <i>some</i> damage award. It wants to hold the prospect of a potentially <i>devastating</i> damage award over the corporate head of Google and to use that as leverage to gain a lasting foothold in the dollar flow of the mobile space via a settlement with Google on potentially brutal terms.<p>2. Judge Alsup is as fair-minded and talented judge as one could want but he also is a tough judge in terms of managing what he allows to come before his court. And he is not buying the outrageously phony damage claims that Oracle is trying to foist upon this trial via its designated expert. Because the law permits him to do so, he is effectively pre-screening what can come before a jury in the case and he has declared that he will put a tight limit on what is permissible. This means that Oracle will not be able to take its crap-shoot before the jury in hopes of gaining <i>in terrorem</i> settlement leverage over Google through the possibility that a crazy jury might be inclined to try to slam Google with a monstrously large damage award.<p>3. Just last year, Judge Phyllis Hamilton, a colleague of Judge Alsup's, reversed a $1.3 billion award in favor of Oracle against SAP. That case involved blatant theft of Oracle's software by TomorrowNow, an SAP subsidiary, and was so bad that SAP admitted liability up front such that the only issue to be tried was the amount of the damages suffered by Oracle. In that case, Oracle put Larry Ellison on the stand and had him speculate that Oracle must have lost $4 billion in software sales as a result of the admitted infringements. There was no factual basis for this claim - just the opinion of the company CEO. Yet that sort of evidence was allowed to go before a jury and the jury bought it. In rethinking the issue (for she had been the judge who had initially allowed it), Judge Hamilton held that this was improper and, in doing so, reduced the verdict to less than a fourth of what the jury had entered. (see, e.g., this report on the case: <a href=""http://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/231600674/judge-reduces-damages-in-oracle-vs-sap-lawsuit.htm;jsessionid=W8LCqI66SPKgQK6-YnhVJA**.ecappj03"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/231600674/judge-redu...</a>) This was a correct ruling and Oracle's prospects of getting it reversed are about zero.<p>4. What Judge Alsup is doing here is acting as gate-keeper to make sure that such junk does not enter into this trial either. In theory, Oracle should not mind this. If all they want is a fair trial, there is nothing wrong with excluding unsupportable expert testimony from that trial. But that is not what Oracle wants. It wants, above all, to be able to hold a huge threat over Google to pressure it into settling on very bad terms.<p>5. In that light, let me translate a few of the items in this order and in the surrounding procedural context: (a) Oracle asked to be able to dismiss its patent infringement claims without prejudice (in effect, asking the court for permission to drop those claims for the moment so that it can reassert them pretty much any time it wants to at a later date, thus keeping a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the Android platform) - the judge said no - translation: ""I am not about to let you play games with the judicial system for ulterior motives: you will get your trial and you will get it here, just as you asked for it in causing Google, the court, and a lot of others to devote huge resources to the handling of the issues you raised;"" (b) Oracle asked that the judge bifurcate its claims such that the copyright claims would be tried first and the patent claims tried in a separate phase of the trial many months down the road - the judge said no - translation: ""You will put on your entire case in one place and not be allowed to play the courts opportunistically by going for multiple bites at the apple;"" (c) the judge took the unusual step of allowing Oracle yet a third try at amending its expert's damages claims even though he had ample discretion to say ""enough is enough"" at this point and to toss them altogether - the judge was not being ""nice"" in doing this - translation: ""Unless you truly come in with something credible, I am going to slam your expert's claims once and for all and I am creating a solid record of giving you a full and final opportunity to fix the problems after fair warning that this was coming and in that way no appellate court will ever reverse that ruling.""<p>6. This is a complex case that could take a variety of directions but one thing is certain: it is in the hands of a very able judge and, if Oracle will ultimately prevail with a big outcome, it will only do so because it deserves this under the law and not because it will get away with gaming the system (as it did, for example, in the TomorrowNow case). And that is why Oracle is reeling concerning its claimed damages in light of this ruling. It is getting trapped (as it should be for these sorts of shenanigans) and it knows it.",1327337037

They can make almost no headway against unions as powerful as the Screen Actor's Guild, and they cannot hire A List actors without using SAG workers.<p>In fact, maybe the best approach to killing the problems with Hollywood (not the industry itself), is to create a platform for studios to hire non-union film professionals, to source music fully owned by the original artist, which comes with boiler plate licensing and employment agreements that are designed for the digital world, with proper 21st century royalties, etc, and that provides a turnkey distribution platform that can put your movie on nearly any country's most popular movie viewing website on the same day.",1327336703

3500953,comment,3494239,3499380,1,0,kstenerud,,,"""going all the way"" means bringing the endeavor you are leading for to a stable conclusion. A leader is most strongly judged based upon his ability to bring and maintain stability. David failed here because he didn't keep his followers' minds upon the inevitable instability that was on the way, so as to prod another leader to step up to the plate. He did ""kinda"" with a few posts, followed by talks with a couple of individuals who didn't work out, but it comes off as half-assed at best. This was followed by an ""I don't owe you a thing"" rant which only makes things worse.<p>An example of good leadership would be Joseph Stilwell, who led an entire Chinese village through miles of jungle so that they'd be out of the way of the advancing Japanese army. He didn't have to do it; standard practice was to just get the hell out of there and leave the collateral damage behind. But he did, and he suffered greatly for it trying to herd along a group of people including elderly, pregnant, sick, and miserable, who slowed the whole thing down, with a serious risk they'd be overrun. He technically didn't owe them a damn thing, and could have at any point said ""screw you guys, I'm going home"". History wouldn't have judged him for not leading them to begin with, but it would have judged harshly if he'd only led partway and then abandoned them.<p>David went against human nature by only posting about an impending end a few months before it occurred, and not giving constant reminders that the end was coming. Technically, he already did more than he was ""required"" to. But people forget, or people are not privy to the communication at the time it was broadcast, or some other number of things happened where the urgency of the message was lost. That's technically their own failing and David technically doesn't owe them a thing (as he points out repeatedly in his rant), but leadership demands much more of a person than is technically ""owed"". A leader must cater to all levels of his followers, including the stubborn, the stupid, the lazy, the uninformed, and the unlucky, and bring most of them stability.<p>In this case, stability means a transfer of leadership to another leader in order to avert the inevitable instability of the site just ending.",1327336555

This means that the plugin only finds ruby people who also have a G+ profile and then adds links to other services too.<p>Now for this to be really useful, it should find people even if they don't have a G+ profile and <i>that</i> is what I wonder whether it's even possible by just crawling the web to the extent allowed by the various services.<p>Adding other Social Networking links to already determined Google+ profiles is not interesting. Finding people on Twitter related to a search term regardless of whether they have a G+ profile or not is the interesting part.",1327335870
3500893,comment,3500122,3500639,4,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Though I made the switch too, I don't get your problem with packages. Debian uses Aptitude same as Ubuntu. It sounds like the problem you had with Debian was that you didn't have the sources you needed in your sources list.<p>I started with CentOS but found it difficult to maintain and set up. Then I switched to Debian because for some reason I felt pressure to not use Ubuntu. People often imply that Ubuntu is for bad programmers, inexperienced people, etc. It's kind of like ""well, all the cool kids are using distro X because we're l33t and you're not cool because you use Ubuntu"" so I stayed away from it for a while. Finally I ended up deciding that it was more important to just get a fucking app running on a server I could most effectively use. I'd been using Xubuntu and Crunchbang on my laptop for a while and so I made the switch and I'm very happy with it. I subsequently redeployed all my VPSes with Ubuntu 11.10 or 10.10 depending on what the hosts offered. I like it because not only is it the easiest for me to manage but it seems like its easier to find help for any problems you may run into and good documentation.<p>I say screw the hipster crowd who are too cool for Ubuntu and just focus on what's best for you. I think people like that are trying to convince themselves of how great they are more than anything else.",1327335857

I certainly would not want a list of various social network batches under every search result.<p>Only list the ones the user is active in? Sure. But how do you determine ""active""? Networks in which the user posts a lot? In which he reads a lot of other users content (how would Google find out about that?)?<p>The integration as it is currently made for G+ basically only works because Google has all that G+ profile data and for it to work as well with other networks, I'd say, Google needs specialized access to it.<p>Or to be more cynical: So twitter wants to have their accounts integrated into the search results of a search engine?

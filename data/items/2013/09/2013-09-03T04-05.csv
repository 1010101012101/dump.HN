6319058,comment,6318525,6318845,1,0,throwawaykf02,,,"I have no specific knowledge at all of any cross-licensing here (and if I did, I surely won&#x27;t comment on it in public), but from the few license deals I very tangentially know of, they happen in terms of portfolios of assets valid at a given time for a given period. That is, you get rights to portfolio X of N issued patents for M years, and I get rights to portfolio Y of P issued patents for Q years. We negotiate to assign some value to those portfolios, and if they don&#x27;t even out, somebody pays the other a royalty.<p>However, I cannot imagine <i>anybody</i> signing an eternal, all-encompassing cross-licensing deal to each others&#x27; portfolios. This is for many reasons, one simply being that one never knows what could be invented, and another being one simply doesn&#x27;t know when the other will stop inventing and thus, reciprocating.<p>Yes, Apple certainly has a cross-license deal in place with MS (in addition to the one from the 90s, given the number of UI features WP shares with iOS but has not been sued over). But I would be very surprised if this acquisition was included in those deals. Rather, the relevant cross-licenses were made when Apple settled with Nokia.",1378184305

The problem with those is that after you&#x27;ve invested lots of time and effort, you end up with a machine that doesn&#x27;t work, but performs that task extremely fast and is relatively cheap.<p>This article is actually great, because it paints a very realisting picture of the experience. Most hackintosh fans fail to mention that your machine might not wake up from sleep, so you either run it 24/7 or shut down fully and wait ages for it to boot afterwards. Or that you&#x27;ll get weird networking problems. Or that your video card driver will crash every once in a while, taking your whole machine down with it. Or that you can&#x27;t click &quot;update&quot; next to an OS update and usually need to manually go through the process of waiting, then reading the forums scanning for people&#x27;s experiences, then moving various kexts out of the way and patching them back in after the upgrade.<p>Yes, I realize there are many people with a nearly flawless experience. But not everyone can get one.<p>In my case, I decided it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth it and bought a real Mac Pro. Couldn&#x27;t be happier, especially as 3 years ago it wasn&#x27;t easy to build a machine with 32GB of RAM. Net result: yes, it was expensive, but it <i>works</i>.",1378184149

The 10.8 install did work (it booted), but the machine would lock up on me from time to time, and some stuff wouldn&#x27;t work. It was also obvious that Apple did not want this to work, so maybe they&#x27;ll put more effort into making sure Mavericks does not work.

We call them programmers because they program.  If you can&#x27;t write programs, you&#x27;re not a programmer.  What other definition of &quot;programmer&quot; could you possibly be using?",1378181137

This landing page was designed with some products that haven&#x27;t launched yet in mind, so most of the copy is vague outside of that context. Honestly we weren&#x27;t expecting any serious traffic until those apps launch later this year, so we&#x27;ve been focused on product, not marketing. (Most of the team is currently experiencing a power outage at home so we missed this being posted to HN as well.)",1378181128

There is no guarantee that the outcome would have been more favorable than being bought out by Microsoft.<p>>Apple obviously is very much in a battle with Android ...<p>Apple already lost to Android. Last count, Android had 80% of the market. There is zero chance of that changing anytime soon. Apple&#x27;s saving grace is that they can cut themselves a nice little niche, and make some good margins based on the strength of their brand much like they do with Macs. This will be doubly true if HTML pushes out native apps and and makes the platform largely superfluous again. The war is over however.",1378181039

Its not the kind of automation that produces code automagically all alone by itself. But software like eclipse pulls the barrier to entry too low to a point even people who understand nothing much about Java or in general about software can comfortable contribute to make a living out of it. And eclipse is only getting better with time. These days you can pretty much code complex Java application without even reading a book. I guess very soon, software like eclipse will fill-in-code-blocks as we express a intention. And then our job will be to stitch those blocks.<p>This is what is dangerous. And this kind of thing has the potential to drive the supply up very quickly. Thereby the wages decline.<p>There is no 1-1 mapping, between a automaker and programmer. But the theme is very common.<p>I am even damn sure we will soon make software a commodity to a point when people can think in terms of abstract software blocks. Just like how a common man can today think of a car in terms of engine, clutch, gear etc.",1378180918

What a story to expand a young mind! <i>Beyond The Blue Event Horizon</i> and <i>Jem</i>, which I re-read earlier this year, also made big impressions.<p>His role in supporting other authors can&#x27;t be overlooked, either -- check out his two-part blog account of how Delaney&#x27;s <i>Dhalgren</i> got published (1).<p>One of the other remarkable things I discovered about Pohl through his blog is just how long he was involved with science fiction. This 2009 post talks about what it was like being a hard-core sci-fi fan <i>in the 1930s</i> (2). I read another one (can&#x27;t find it now) where he talks about joining the first &quot;con&quot; in the same decade, and meeting some early writers. Almost all of them were gone by the time he wrote the blog post ... he was the last one who remembered that era of raw imagination, and had lived to see many future technologies and concepts become reality. His writing reflected a pessimism about humanity, but also a sense of hope.<p>Thank you, Mr. Pohl, for your gifts to the world.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2010/11/chip-delany/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2010/11/chip-delany/</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2009/09/let-there-be-fandom-the-science-fiction-league/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2009/09/let-there-be-fan...</a>",1378180851

If you have an unfamiliar accent to your audience, you might have issues being understood and respected. And if you make public remarks about aspects of people they can&#x27;t fully control--particularly when it comes to language--you should probably make sure you&#x27;re not mixing your message with sarcasm. To do so really obscures whether you&#x27;re trying to be helpful or trying to be perceived as clever, yourself.<p>I just hope we all learn something from this instead of just getting all defensive.",1378180802

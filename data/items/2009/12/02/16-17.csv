Perhaps the most abusive of all is the aggressive imposition of reverse vesting without protections of any kind for the entrepreneur from arbitrary terminations. Throw in abusive liquidation preferences, etc. and the result is that entrepreneurs should be very selective in doing VC deals. Until this climate changes for the better, do them only after you have built significant value in your company and have reasonable leverage in negotiating terms.",1259772959

Its not like these games start you off on a path, tell you ""oh, once you've played for X long you'll be able to get Y,"" and then changing it so that once you get to X you find out that you also have to spend a dollar to get Y (some of these games might, but the ones I've played haven't, they've all been very clear up front what costs money and what doesn't). Most of them don't even make it so that you can't get to the goalposts without paying money, they just make it take considerably longer.<p>I fail to see how charging money for faster progress is taking advantage of idiocy. As another example, look at television programming. I can get a half dozen broadcast channels for free. If I want more, and want to get more out of my tv watching experience by having more choice in it, I have to pay for cable, who then offers me various packages, depending on how much each of those channels is worth to me.<p>It doesn't make it idiocy to value things differently than other people. I value $10 a month more than HBO. Does that make all of the people who pay for HBO idiots? Does that make all it blackmail for the cable company to offer a trial of HBO when I sign up (admittedly, that practice is slightly shady, due to the difficulty to stop the channels after the trial, but that is a completely different issue)? Just because you put more value on your money than others do on a shiny digital fish doesn't make them an idiot, it makes them someone who values shiny digital fish.<p>-To your edit:<p>Well, if that was the way things were from the start, sure. Say you go to the arcade, and pick out your game to play. To make this all fit well, lets pick tetris. As long as you know from the start there are various ""powerups"" you can buy throughout the game, it seems totally fair. Its 1 quarter to start the game. Later in, you can buy various powerups, like double points for one level for another quarter, or the ability to choose your next block for a quarter.<p>Does it make things different? Yes. But it certainly doesn't make them unfair. The options are open to everyone, those at the top and those trying to get there. Its fair, but is a little shady.",1259772630

They've recouped their expenses from the TMJ loan by taking 90% of the band's profits throughout the years. There is no negative cash flow here.<p>What they are missing, however; is the payment from the band. Presumably they agreed to pay back the full amount out of their pockets in the original contract. And where does their personal income flow from? Royalties. This is how I see the numbers if they were to pay back the loan:<p>Gross Profit: $4,000,000\nTMJ Share: 400,000\nWarner Share: 3,600,000<p>TMJ Profit: $0\nWarner Profit: $4,000,000<p>Warner Bros. will essentially make a 10x ROI before TMJ earns a dime.

You are making an incorrect assumption about signatures: They are there to verify or dispute that you authorized a purchase, if necessary, after the fact. The whole <i>point</i> is that the vendor saves the data, because it is his proof that you were there.<p>Signatures are about managing by exception, because it is impractical to do anything else.<p>Biometric signing, properly implemented, is far more secure than a signature.<p>Consider:<p>* POS system grabs biometric data and encodes it.<p>* POS system transmits the biometric data to the bank, who returns a cryptographically signed timestamp.<p>* Biometric signature, authorization, and timestamp are then bundled together and cryptographically signed by the vendor. This becomes the receipt.<p>* Vendor stores the result locally as proof of sale. Customer receive the same as proof of sale.<p>Thus, the bank, for the first time, has actual proof of the presence of a customer. This makes the signature stronger. Also, vendor and customer both have much stronger proof of transaction to dispute / verify same.<p>No system is impossible to subvert.

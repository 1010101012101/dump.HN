4800424,comment,4799134,4799134,1,0,Petefine,,,"In my experience as a merchant, disputes can be very time sensitive (i.e. travel cancellations). On one hand, finding out about a misunderstanding from you (rather than a chargeback fax two months later) may allow a much easier dispute resolution and be so be valuable to a merchant. But on the other hand, customers who cancel/complain by charging back instead of calling the merchant may therefore lose a chargeback because they miss an agreed deadline. Adding your service as a middleman could lead to further missed deadlines.<p>This is especially true since any good merchant privacy policy/PCI DSS would of course prevent them from discussing anything with you without direct approval from the customer first - and if they did that, they may as well discuss the issue direct anyway.<p>Lastly, the toughest chargebacks can take months to resolve. Help with that (as a merchant) would be very useful(and so I can imagine you providing a compelling service), but are you really committing to take on a potentially complex issue for the customer? And wouldn't it be a conflict to represent both parties? Still, a tool that eases the admin of chargebacks could be great for both sides...",1353239948

They get cancer, get an unsupportive SO, get a needy family member, lose a rich uncle, etc., they kill the company. Having 2+ founders guards against these likelihoods (over the course of the company).<p>Not really true at all, as has been pointed out by other posters.<p>In the book ""masters of doom"" they relate that even though Id software had 4 founders when it came time for them to get key man insurance the only person they got it on was John Carmack.<p>I'd think that most companies are like this.  There may be multiple co-founders but there is usually one signifcant one, who if they quit, would sink the company very quickly.",1353239810

4800418,comment,4799737,4800225,3,0,UntitledNo4,,,"To me, it's not about how many devices they have and whether that makes sense, it's about the fact that they had spent $200,000, which then generated $5,000 (this year only, don't know how long they've been at it), they had to move to a smaller flat, the guy had to get another job, and then they just had to buy two new iPhone 5s (which are mentioned later on in the article). Why? Can you justify spending that if your income from iOS development is $5,000 a year? That what gives me the feeling it's an addiction.<p>Now, I assume the new iPhone 5 is so different to the ones before it (screen size) that you have to test for it separately. If I was down $195,000 in a year (or two) and I felt this, I'd buy a new generation iPod touch instead. Or two, if they really can't share the device.<p>I also look at the picture and I question if they really need 5 computers between them if they only work on the two laptops.<p>Anyway, my point is not that having X amount of devices (Apple or others) per person is an addiction, if you can afford it, go for it and enjoy yourself. My point is that this couple seem to be struggling financially and cannot stop themselves from buying more devices. I'm trying not to be judgemental, but to me it sounds like an addiction.",1353239608

4800412,comment,4799314,4799314,10,0,adrianhoward,,,"More talking about the comments here than the book - but I'm seeing lots of repetitions of the working-alone-vital and teleworking-vital anecdotes.<p>The thing is - I don't care about individual productivity. I care about productivity of the business as a whole.<p>And on that point pretty much all the evidence I can find shows that co-located teams in a war-room like environment are the most productive.<p>(And I'm saying this as somebody who spends a lot of their time working from home, and talking to other folk over Skype, etc. There are reasons for telecommuting - personal preference, getting access to people who cannot co-locate, etc. But for business productivity I'm not seeing much, if any, evidence).<p>Please not that I am not saying:<p>* Telecommuting is bad (I do it - I like it)<p>* Telecommuting projects will fail (D'oh - of course not)<p>* You shouldn't telecommute (of course you should if you want to - but bear in mind that the business may have good reasons to disagree with that decision)<p>* That telecommuting makes you individually less productive (I'm personally unsure about this. I feel more productive when working by myself, but I know that personal perceptions of productivity can be false. Measuring personal vs team/company productivity becomes hard in anything less than the short term)<p>* That co-location is always the best solution (it isn't - other factors like team location and skills come into play)<p>What I am saying is that there is a lot of research showing that co-located teams in war-room like settings are <i>much</i> more productive. This runs counter to many developers preferences (mine too ;-) so it tends to get ignored.<p>So much more productive that solutions like 'Let's fly everybody to the same place and pay their room and board for a month' can be cost effective.<p>Here are some references to the research (If anybody has any research that contradicts this I'd love to hear about it. Especially if it talks about actual measured metrics of productivity - rather that self-reported 'I felt just as productive at home' ones.)<p>----<p>""It doesn't take much distance before a team feels the negative effects of distribution - the effectiveness of collaboration degrades rapidly with physical distance. People located closer in a building are more likely to collaborate (Kraut, Egido & Galegher 1990). Even at short distances, 3 feet vs. 20 feet, there is an effect (Sensenig & Reed 1972). A distance of 100 feet may be no better than several miles (Allen 1977). A field study of radically collocated software development teams,[...], showed significantly higher productivity and satisfaction than industry benchmarks and past projects within the firm (Teasley et al., 2002). Another field study compared interruptions in paired, radically-collocated and traditional, cube-dwelling software development teams, and found that in the former interruptions were greater in number but shorter in duration and more on-task (Chong and Siino 2006). Close proximity improves productivity in all cases.""

Notice that I said many, not all nor most, but you put extra focus on it as if I did.<p>It is true, but I&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s not true for everyone. People&#x27;s reasons for suicide can be quite complex and often times no one but the person knows or understands the reasoning. To change behaviors without addressing the root causes of the behavior provides the possibility of the behavior returning. It&#x27;s much the same with alcoholism and drug addiction.<p>How is this discussion related to the original article that didn&#x27;t bring this subject matter up? It&#x27;s related because suicide rates came up in the discussion and I stated that I&#x27;m personally more worried over soldiers returning from war who receive next to no help versus students who agonize getting counseling over what classes they should take next semester. If a student is depressed and considering suicide because they feel they are failing themselves, their parents, or whatever to the point of considering suicide, then I want help available for them. But then, no one here has said anything about being against that, right?",1439326704

It&#x27;s a heuristic that may or may not make sense. But it&#x27;s one borne of ignorance and the privilege of not having to think about these things (being a white, highly-educated male), and being surrounded by, I assume, upstanding males who don&#x27;t rape, and upstanding white folk who are not racists.<p>it&#x27;s posts like yours that remind me that my instincts can be wrong and harmful in practice, and while I&#x27;m free to feel as I feel, it&#x27;s posts like yours, and stories from my friends, that shock me whenever I hear them, and that give me some perspective and make me realize my instinct is not a precious thing to protect or defend above everything else.<p>Please remember that it really helps to explain things the way you do. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a responsibility to do so, or that not doing so gives &#x27;us&#x27; the right to remain oblivious. Far from it.<p>I&#x27;m simply saying that practically speaking, posts like yours are much more helpful than blanket judgments and (perceived) knee-jerk outrage. It benefits everyone to try and paint a picture of a perspective that is not necessarily shared personally, however unnecessary it should be to do so.<p>I wish I was good enough to be sensitive all by myself, but the sad fact is that even I as a person with a sizable amount of close friends who are gay, bisexual, female, or minorities (in every sense of the word), can forget that not everyone shares my rather privileged perspective.<p>And it&#x27;s really helpful for me to be reminded that, say, a rape joke might not be a problem for me, but that it might be a problem in a larger context where rapists justify their actions by it.",1439326675

The reason for that is they can move and work remotely quite easily and they are quite frequently looking for some more colleagues to work with in their projects or Startups (again, like myself).<p>The quality of life is something abstract depending on the members of the community, it could be anything from organizing bootcamps or accelerators to yoga, paragliding or having a good chef cooking for everyone.<p>We haven&#x27;t yet started to make all the work to promote this but if anyone is interested or would like to participate I&#x27;m here to answer any questions.",1439326145

It&#x27;s long and tedious, because a lot of it is very simple things you learn very early on writing and maintaining software.<p>You seem to be arguing that your example demonstrates the fact that you can localize a bug in the code with binary search; specifically that the bug must exist in either a() or b(), and that running them independently is both possible and will determine the single location of the bug.<p>This is not true. It is <i>only</i> true in the case that one assumes bugs must have single locations, and that those locations can be found with binary search over what amount to incomplete programs. In other words, you&#x27;re assuming the prior, begging the question, etc.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to say &quot;real code isn&#x27;t like this contrived example&quot; but in fact this contrived example is the best possible demonstration of why blind binary search is a poor strategy. Let us say the &#x27;bug&#x27; exists in a(). You seem to be assuming this is the necessary consequence:<p>main () { a(); b(); } -- segfaults\nmain () { a(); /* b(); <i>/ } -- segfaults\nmain () { /</i> a(); <i>/ b(); } -- doesn&#x27;t segfault<p>But this isn&#x27;t the only possibility. With the bug existing in a(), you could also see this result:<p>main () { a(); b(); } -- segfaults\nmain () { a(); /</i> b(); <i>/ } -- segfaults\nmain () { /</i> a(); <i>/ b(); } -- segfaults<p>You would expect this in situations where b() uses data structures created by a().<p>We may also see this result, still assuming the bug exists in a():<p>main () { a(); b(); } -- segfaults\nmain () { a(); /</i> b(); <i>/ } -- doesn&#x27;t segfault\nmain () { /</i> a(); <i>/ b(); } -- segfaults<p>If above we learned nothing, here we&#x27;ve actually got a falsehood - our binary search has localized the bug to b(), but it actually exists in a()!<p>So, in practice, binary search fails to localize a bug in a(). All of these situations can be created by having a() write a global which is relied upon by b() - a() may write to a protected area, b() may have a default value, a() may write nonsense, or pass an integer where b() expects an address - none of this is particularly exotic, they&#x27;re all the sort of things you get every day when debugging segfaults.<p>We might now delve into a competing series of contrived examples of a() and b() and argue about their relative prevalence in the world (which none of us are capable of knowing), because if some case is particularly rare, it may make binary search very slightly better than flipping a coin in this case.<p>Instead, I will point out that this is </i>once again* assuming the prior, and that we have these simple (if shockingly annoying) facts:<p>1) side effects exist\n2) in the presence of side-effects, binary search cannot predict the location of a bug.<p>And it follows that in the sense that a &quot;scientific&quot; hypothesis has predictive power, then binary search over the codebase is basically the homeopathy of debugging.",1439325213

(It could be taught there as well, of course, to the same degree that mechanical engineering is - which I suspect is not much.)<p>My larger point:  According to your thinking, then, we need to take the people who are studying computer science, and move maybe 98% of them to a software engineering major.  If CS is what you define it to be, we absolutely do not need as many CS graduates as we have people enrolled in CS.<p>What we currently have is that the schools think they should be teaching CS (per your definition), and both the students and the outside world are expecting the courses to teach what is actually useful out in industry - software engineering.  I could actually see this as a useful split (we separated physics from mechanical engineering).

That&#x27;s not the social contract you take on when you visit a theater.<p>In this case, the social contract is stated in actually stated in words you can read. Just read the terms of service on many websites.

This ended up being incredible slow however, with performance penalties for hardfpu machines as well. The new ABI (EABI) requires that the binary be built either for soft or hard float, which no longer requires the kernel to get involved.",1439323785

But if Mozilla thought users were <i>practically able</i> to exercise that freedom, there would be no way for them to impose a change like this; all the users would switch to a fork.  In practice, maintaining a fork of a major active software project is a huge amount of work and easily to do poorly (think of the Debian OpenSSL hole), and nearly all the people qualified to do it work at Mozilla or are burned out.  And Mozilla, if they want to make it harder to maintain a fork, has a wide variety of strategies at their disposal.<p>(In case it matters, I&#x27;m typing this comment in Iceweasel!)<p>As a side note, it seems to me rather in poor taste to attack my intelligence in the first line of your comment, and suggests that you think your arguments won&#x27;t stand on their own merits.",1439323233

10043928,comment,10037157,10038388,0,0,munificent,,,"GC and runtime.<p>A modern GC is a large, complex beast. Python, Ruby, Lua, etc. all have their own implementations of them, and those implementations are specific to the semantics of those languages. (For example, Python&#x27;s early finalizers. Ruby&#x27;s FFI, etc.) That&#x27;s a big blob of code for you to push down the wire with your application every time the user hits your site.<p>Also, that GC doesn&#x27;t know how to play nice with the browser&#x27;s own GC. If you have an event handler that has a reference to some Ruby object that in turn has a reference to some DOM node, neither GC can trace through that path and tell when those objects can be collected. That means you get memory leaks.<p>On top of that, the language implementation itself is large. The Python executable on my machine is 2 MB. Do you want to add another 2 MB to your app? Is Python <i>enough</i> better than JS to justify forcing all of your users on their crappy mobile networks to download that before any interactivity begins on your page? What about when you start using the additional 45 MB of standard library that comes with Python?<p>Also, how do you make those standard libraries work in a browser? Who is going to rewrite them all to stop using the native OS libraries they currently use and instead rely on APIs that are available in JS?<p>That&#x27;s not to say this is an insurmountable problem. But my belief is that it&#x27;s a big enough headache to outweigh the benefits you would get from writing your app in another higher level language.<p>Now, if your language can compile to <i>JavaScript</i> and has a decently small runtime library, that&#x27;s a different story. At that point, you&#x27;re back to only one GC and relatively little overhead for your language&#x27;s semantics and core libraries. It means you don&#x27;t have to worry about a large existing standard library that #includes everything under the sun.<p>This is why I think CoffeeScript, ClojureScript, Dart, etc. are feasible. But I don&#x27;t think anyone will be writing web apps in Ruby or Python anytime soon. Languages that look syntactically similar to them (Opal, Red, Pyjamas, Brython, etc.), sure. But the real deal where you can have some app that does, I don&#x27;t know, &quot;import requests&quot; and have it actually work in a shippably-sized web app? I think that&#x27;s going to be a much harder path.<p>It&#x27;s a great goal for the WebAssembly folks to work towards, but it&#x27;s an aspirational goal.",1439323209

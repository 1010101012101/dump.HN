1327409,story,,,2,1,AKSHAYUDAYBHAT,"Ask HN: Why is WebMD so profitable?",,"I have a question regarding WebMD and it's good financial performance. WebMD is a publishing company similar to (in a sense) the Old School Magazine publishers.  However in a time when other content producers are loosing money continuously, WebMD seems to earning quite handsomely?<p>http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=WBMD+Profile<p>Can you help me understanding reasons for it:
Here are my guesses<p>1: Unlike other publishers WebMD reviews it contents from a certified doctor 
hence people are more likely to trust it over mom and pop blogs.<p>2: A real good SEO job, since for nearly any health related term it is one of the top few results.<p>3: Web focused content development, unlike other companies which are still focusing on print media.<p>4: A niche market and first mover advantage. ( WSJ, Newsweek have many competitors)<p>5: Aggressive nature of advertisers. Most of the advertisers on WebMD seem to be drug companies which spend significant amounts on advertising, and WebMD represents a perfect platform to reach out to potential consumers?<p>Also in light of potential competitors like HealthLine (a focused semantic search engine) receiving VC funding. Is content aggregation a good idea as far as healthcare related information of internet is concerned?

We're talking about a culture that doesn't understand that when it comes to design, 1+1 should equal 3 or more.

On the one hand, there's a very industrial-psychology-derived HCI tradition, based on user-testing everything with statistical significance and so on, that tends to do relatively small changes, e.g. assuming that most of the design will stay as it is, how about widget A versus widget B? Against them, there's more of a <i>design</i> tradition, derived from architecture, graphic design, art, and other areas, that looks at more holistic sorts of issues, and tends to think that doing 1000 A/B tests does not add up to ""design"", and isn't likely to produce good outcomes either. HCI hasn't really resolved the issue over several decades, and it flares up now and then (my impression is that the main HCI conferences/journals are ~80% the industrial-psych sort, but the 20% dissenters have persistently stuck around for decades).",1273235554

I got some inspiration for this webapp a few months ago here on HN, someone had built something similar for another city, my webapp is for DC only. Basically only useful if you frequently park in DC. If you provide your vehicle information and an email address, it will periodically check the DMVs online parking ticket system to see if you have a ticket, and if you do it'll email you a reminder about it. Just another small hobby project, still not a web designer as you can see. Would appreciate any feedback.",1273235265

I don't work in any relevant field, and have no formal medical education.]<p>Keep in mind that autism tends to improve over time without any intervention. This is why it is mostly considered as a pediatric diagnosis. There are of course many autistic adults, but severity of symptoms almost invariably declines in later childhood. Also, causality is hard to tease out: Whether he started dancing because he improved or whether he improved because he started dancing is anyone's guess.<p>That being said, there are reasons to believe that certain cerebellar dysfunctions are involved with autism. Physical clumsiness and lack of coordination is so common it is usually considered a necessary condition for making a diagnosis of autism. Studies have shown that autistics have impaired ability to tap consistent rhythms relative to children without autism (matched for age and IQ). Some have speculated that such dysfunctions are involved with the lack of cerebral coordination usually seen as a more proximate cause of autistic symptoms, such as the lack of a negative correlation between the task-positive and default networks. I'm not familiar with any reported non-kinesthetic cognitive benefits of thereapy designed to teach rhythm and coordination, and I don't imagine many have tried -- dyspraxia symptoms are notoriously immune to therapy, both in autistics and children with other development disorders. It'd be fun data to see, though.",1273234399

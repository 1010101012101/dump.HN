I didn't say that a writer wasn't able to do plumbing; only that he was overqualified to do so.<p>There are some fields, such as writing or computer programming, where the gap between ""average"" and ""good"" is huge; and other fields, such as plumbing, where the gap is relatively modest.  A fantastic plumber might be twice as good as an average plumber, but he isn't a hundred times better.<p>If you're a good writer or computer programmer, you can make a far larger contribution to society by working in those fields than by working as a plumber, no matter how fantastic a plumber you might happen to be.  That's what I mean by being overqualified.",1225636993

Sure, a plumber has to deal with some pretty unpleasant substances, but then again so does a surgeon.",1225636950

Some of those quotes are taken so out of context its unfair.  All the candidates are human and are speaking in front of people non-stop for days.  Eventually we get stupid sound bites because people get tired and make mistakes.  McCain calling someone a jerk was fairly tongue and cheek.  The question he was asked was a pointless one ""Are you too old?"" so he ended his response with ""little jerk"" as a joke to keep the audience.

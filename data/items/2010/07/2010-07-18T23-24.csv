This is obviously a throwaway account, since I'd prefer not to be terribly public about using it (although I'd be more than happy to talk about it in person). Note that I'm not really the best writer in the world normally, and you'll probably find that this writing is similar - despite being ""boosted"" with ""mind-enhancing"" medication.<p>Some highlights: I've been taking it off and on for almost 2 years now. The first stint was for a length of about 3 months back in 2008/2009. When I first started taking it I was affected so dramatically I routinely paused using it to make sure it wasn't something I was going to become dependent on, or would have a noticeable cumulative damaging effect upon discontinuation of use. I'm the founder of a technology startup (which I won't name so don't ask) and so I was immediately intrigued by the possibilities when I read about the drug. At that time I had just started on a massive code rewrite project that had to be done as soon as possible (since every day this project wasn't finished we were losing potential revenue). One of the other members of the team estimated the project would take around 3 months, and we couldn't avoid doing it. I was able to finish the project in 1 month. However, I should admit that I had a lot of things going for me besides the medicine - it was a new code base and a new language that I had wanted to learn, so that combined with the urgency and reward of increased revenue was a huge motivator. I will say that the focus that the drug gave me was probably a significant factor in getting it completed as fast as I did. I'll explain why I think it's a perfect compliment for this kind of project by talking about all of the ""features"" of the drug below. Other notable effects of my use which I will expand on include loss of about 15-20lbs (205-185/190), a much improved social life, enhanced/stabilized mood, and the ability to be alert and awake and mostly functional at any conceivable time of day or night, regardless of the amount of sleep achieved in the previous day. This is not to say there aren't any downsides of tradeoffs, there definitely are - it just turns out that for me, I find that the benefits so far outweigh the consequences.<p>This comment was too long, so I continued this here: <a href=""http://throw-nhnzo.posterous.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://throw-nhnzo.posterous.com/</a>",1279496911

Social is the web now; its a fluid idea.  What do you want your product to do? to achieve?  How is this going to make my life easier, better, more fun?

Before she moved on, she (or her live-in boyfriend) left holes in the walls, the garden shed literally stuffed full of trash, the carpets full of fleas and a big hole in the yard from the dog not permitted in the lease, dirt ground into the kitchen floor that took me a day and a half to scrub out (like, bus-station-level gum), and a street full of really, really pissed neighbors.<p>Poverty is endemic, and Section 8 doesn't help, even though I really wish it did.  However, eliminating Section 8 won't help, either, I suspect.<p>I wish I knew an answer.",1279494583

I sent out an announcement email to a list of people who requested to be informed about the game.  The game's artist posted an announcement on her blog.  I submitted a Lite version of the app yesterday.<p>Is there anything else I can do?  I feel like I have exhausted my free options.  Advertising is a possibility but I only want to spend money earned from the game on advertising.  AppCircle is probably out given my game is $.99 and they charge $.75 per install.<p>Any advice based on your own experience is appreciated.",1279494493

Despite Charley's focus on Microsoft's successes, Gates never once gives any indication that things will always be that way, and shows that a company could easily come in and change the landscape, just as Microsoft did with IBM.<p>Looking back at this now, its interesting to note how he never mentioned 'search' as a type of company that could derive significant revenue from an advertising based business model on the internet.  In fact, at no point during this interview did he discuss internet search.  It was exactly this oversight by Microsoft and the wider technology industry that paved the way for Google.",1279494461

It's good to hear that she keeps up.<p>Anyway, ""something not impossible to master"" might not be necessarily optimal. In your scenario of browser usage the mouse adds an unneeded layour of complexity in terms of usability.<p>Whilst human beings are normally used to interact with their hands directly, sometimes they were apt enough to design tools when their hands just weren't enough. With hands you can't make a fire. With hands you can't dig up a field.<p>What you can do with your hands is push a button or a link. There's no need for an abstracted tool. The mouse provides nothing a single touch wouldn't. The mouse just provides clutter.<p>Still, I'm glad for your grandmother to have mastered it though. Whatever works to make people happy.

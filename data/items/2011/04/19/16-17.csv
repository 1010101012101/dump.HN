A number of points raised by the author Kevin gives the feeling that he has a supernatural insight into why tradeoffs were made. Reading this review over, each point seems obvious, but that's how a good review should be. And these points were certainly not obvious during the planning for Backbone.<p>The conventions that served DocumentCloud well are conventions that work for many other web apps.

In order to make a really good UI you have to make <i>sacrifices</i>. A lot of them. All the time. Your time, for one thing. Most of your good ideas, the ones that you really liked...will end up not <i>quite</i> working, and need to be abandoned. Especially the <i>really</i> cool ones. That back-end that you wrote so elegantly? Well there's a critical use-case that requires you to write in a section of special-cased inelegance. Or, even worse, in developing the UI you realize that it really, <i>really</i> needs <i>this</i> feature...which will unfortunately require you to redesign your backend architecture.<p>Most engineers who set out to ""make the UI"" aren't willing to make those sacrifices, so you get a crappy UI. That's not meant to insult engineers, because they have plenty of other things to worry about. But unless you take it truly, painfully seriously, all you get is shit.",1303232345

Perhaps we could salvage some of that time and put it to more productive use.  And then perhaps after a few years we can go back and look at it again.  People think of math as a sort of tree structure where you need this long chain of tools to get to understand each new concept.  I am simply suggesting it's closer to a graph where multiple approaches can reach the same concept and reinforce each other.<p>As to the SAT it's mostly a middle school math test.  I suspect after a while you build a little crib sheet of the basic concepts that people needed to understand.

What they have already gives them informational asymmetry over you and other users in aggregate - and that's what matters to them.  By having access to your search history, documents, emails, spreadsheets, pictures, text messages, blogs, videos, your web page analytics, visitors, purchases, location, friends etc etc they're always guaranteed to be one step ahead of you. That ensures predicting with satisfiable accuracy, say, what you'll buy next, what you'll visit next, where you'd click next, where you'd go next, or, in general what you'll do next. This gives them a clear advantage in terms of controlling a good part of your online life and in turn a good part of your real life. If you feel that's something you can live with, that's fine. Older people recommend not putting all the eggs in one basket (even Google apparently listens to them by diversifying immensely). I am sorry if this may sounds a bit unrealistic/gloomy to you but there's never been an entity in the history of the world that has not abused the power that was given to them.",1303231951

Recur can go to the top of the function, or an enclosing loop block inside the function.<p>To do mutual recursion in Clojure, you use a trampoline. That looks like<p><pre><code>    (declare even? odd?)\n\n    (defn even? [x]\n      (if (= x 0)\n        true\n        #(odd? (dec x)))\n\n    (defn odd? [x]\n      (if (= x 1)\n        true\n        #(even? (dec x)))\n\n    (trampoline even? 100)\n</code></pre>\nWhat we're doing here is defining two mutually recursive functions, but instead of calling the other directly, we return a function of no arguments that calls the other function. Then call trampoline, passing the function and any arguments. Not the most elegant solution, but it works.",1303230631
2463105,comment,2462678,2462875,5,0,cube13,,,">I think one option is to accept that the bitcoin protocol will be forked massively and design it from the ground up to support exchanges between various versions of the protocol. That way, libertarians could avoid versions with inflationary policies. In this setup, would there be any reason for an entity to choose an inflatable flavor of bitcoin? Perhaps certain businesses and banks would be coerced to through regulation and that would create more widespread demand for those forks. It seems possible that most users would use the regulated bitcoins and the libertarian version might become a black-market currency.<p>And to do this, that means that you need some trusted way to determine the price of Bitcoin 1.0 versus Bitcoin 2.0.<p>Which means you need a centralized place, let's call it an exchange, to determine the rates between the two version.  Since you probably want the rates to be consistent across the entire network at any given time(otherwise, what's the point of a non-inflationary currency), it's probably a decent idea to maintain a centralized location for that that decides the rates.  A decentralized method may be possible, but I sincerely doubt that it will work in a way that would actually encourage people to convert to the other currency to purchase things.<p>In either case, you still need something that can regulate the transactions to make sure that everyone is behaving correctly.  If people aren't(which should be the first assumption you make about anything), you'll need some method of dealing with it.<p>So... yeah.  You just created the Federal Reserve and money markets.<p>Realistically, given that it's a democratically run, the current Bitcoin implementation is in the same boat, if the biggest users decide to change their policies, the entire network can end up in a similar situation where a Bitcoin from X is worth a different amount from a Bitcoin from Y.<p>I don't really understand how Bitcoin is better than the current currency system.  It's just different because it's on the internet.",1303230607

I would recommend you break your system down into a number of separate modules and manage them separately, giving the modules their own release schedules and properly managing the dependencies between them. ""The granule of reuse is the granule of release"" [1], so if you don't have a formal release process around individual modules, you can't reliably reuse them. If you do that you can create separate repositories for each module, and you'll then find that your branches are more tightly scoped (to a single module), merges are simpler as a result, volume of change is localised to the less stable modules and weird file types can be restricted to specific modules.<p>Once you've refactored your codebase you'll be in a position to make better choices about a source control system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/granularity.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/granularity.p...</a>",1303229567

That serves up exercises for students, but it doesn't allow students the learning opportunities developed by working on actual problems. The rest of this comment is a FAQ file I send to families of new students in my math classes about the distinction between ""exercises"" and ""problems.""<p>PROBLEMS VERSUS EXERCISES<p>I frequently encounter discussions among parents about repetitive school math lessons, so a few years ago I prepared this Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) document about the distinction between math exercises (good in sufficient but not excessive amount) and math problems (always good in any amount).<p>Most books about mathematics have what are called ""exercises"" in them, questions that prompt a learner to practice the concepts discussed in the mathematics book. By reading one mathematics book, and then several more, I learned that some mathematicians draw a distinction between ""exercises"" and ""problems"" (which is the terminology generally used by the mathematicians who draw this distinction). I think this distinction is useful for teachers and learners to consider while selecting materials for studying mathematics, so I'll share the quotations from which I learned this distinction here. I first read about the distinction between exercises and problems in a Taiwan reprint of a book by Howard Eves.<p>""It is perhaps pertinent to make a comment or two here about the problems of the text. There is a distinction between what may be called a PROBLEM and what may be considered an EXERCISE. The latter serves to drill a student in some technique or procedure, and requires little, if any, original thought. Thus, after a student beginning algebra has encountered the quadratic formula, he should undoubtedly be given a set of exercises in the form of specific quadratic equations to be solved by the newly acquired tool. The working of these exercises will help clinch his grasp of the formula and will assure his ability to use the formula. An exercise, then, can always be done with reasonable dispatch and with a minimum of creative thinking. In contrast to an exercise, a problem, if it is a good one for its level, should require thought on the part of the student. The student must devise strategic attacks, some of which may fail, others of which may partially or completely carry him through. He may need to look up some procedure or some associated material in texts, so that he can push his plan through. Having successfully solved a problem, the student should consider it to see if he can devise a different and perhaps better solution. He should look for further deductions, generalizations, applications, and allied results. In short, he should live with the thing for a time, and examine it carefully in all lights. To be suitable, a problem must be such that the student cannot solve it immediately. One does not complain about a problem being too difficult, but rather too easy.<p>""It is impossible to overstate the importance of problems in mathematics. It is by means of of problems that mathematics develops and actually lifts itself by its own bootstraps. Every research article, every doctoral thesis, every new discovery in mathematics, results from an attempt to solve some problem. The posing of appropriate problems, then, appears to be a very suitable way to introduce the student to mathematical research. And it is worth noting, the more problems one plays with, the more problems one may be able to pose on one's own. The ability to propose significant problems is one requirement to be a creative mathematician.""<p>Eves, Howard (1963). A Survey of Geometry volume 1. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, page ix.<p>I have since read about this distinction in several other books.<p>""Before going any further, let's digress a minute to discuss different levels of problems that might appear in a book about mathematics:<p>Level 1. Given an explicit object x and an explicit property P(x), prove that P(x) is true. . . .<p>Level 2. Given an explicit set X and an explicit property P(x), prove that P(x) is true for FOR ALL x [existing in] X. . . .<p>Level 3. Given an explicit set X and an explicit property P(x), prove OR DISPROVE that P(x) is true for for all x [existing in] X. . . .<p>Level 4. Given an explicit set X and an explicit property P(x), find a NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITION Q(x) that P(x) is true. . . .<p>Level 5. Given an explicit set X, find an INTERESTING PROPERTY P(x) of its elements. Now we're in the scary domain of pure research, where students might think that total chaos reigns. This is real mathematics. Authors of textbooks rarely dare to pose level 5 problems.""<p>Graham, Ronald, Knuth, Donald, and Patashnik, Oren (1994). Concrete Mathematics Second Edition. Boston: Addison-Wesley, pages 72-73.<p>This digression becomes the subject of a, um, problem in Exercise 4 of Chapter 3: ""The text describes problems at levels 1 through 5. What is a level 0 problem? (This, by the way, is NOT a level 0 problem.)""<p>""First, what is a PROBLEM? We distinguish between PROBLEMS and EXERCISES. An exercise is a question that you know how to resolve immediately. Whether you get it right or not depends on how expertly you apply specific techniques, but you don't need to puzzle out what techniques to use. In contrast, a problem demands much thought and resourcefulness before the right approach is found. . . .<p>""A good problem is mysterious and interesting. It is mysterious, because at first you don't know how to solve it. If it is not interesting, you won't think about it much. If it is interesting, though, you will want to put a lot of time and effort into understanding it.""<p>Zeitz, Paul (1999). The Art and Craft of Problem Solving. New York: Wiley, pages 3 and 4.<p>"". . . . As Paul Halmos said, 'Problems are the heart of mathematics,' so we should 'emphasize them more and more in the classroom, in seminars, and in the books and articles we write, to train our students to be better problem-posers and problem-solvers than we are.'<p>""The problems we have selected are definitely not exercises. Our definition of an exercise is that you look at it and know immediately how to complete it. It is just a question of doing the work, whereas by a problem, we mean a more intricate question for which at first one has probably no clue to how to approach it, but by perseverance and inspired effort one can transform it into a sequence of exercises.""<p>Andreescu, Titu & Gelca, Razvan (2000), Mathematical Olympiad Challenges. Boston: Birkhuser, page xiii.<p>""It is easier to advance in one topic by going ahead with the more elementary parts of another topic, where the first one is applied. The brain much prefers to work that way, rather than to concentrate on ugly technical formulas which are obviously unrelated to anything except artificial drilling. Of course, some rote drilling is necessary. The problem is how to strike a balance.""<p>Lang, Serge (1988), Basic Mathematics. New York: Springer-Verlag, p. xi.",1303229299

Memorize multiplication tables instead of learn to do arbitrary multiplications quickly. Memorize your table of elements instead of emphasis on what it means. Memorize how to find the roots of a quadratic function, the rules for arithmetic with fractions, physics equations... (I'm pretty bad at memorizing, so this doubly infuriated me because I had to look for the underlying relationships to do well). Even after my province introduced a new curriculum which was supposed to stop all that and focus away from memorization.<p>Anecdotally, this is only slowly changing if at all, as new teachers come in and old ones who won't give up on rote memorization retire.

So if you have started a company in 2010 and you are earning $3000/month, then health insurance will cost you $90.<p>- Freelancers working on contract basis can pay either a fixed amount of ~100$ (when working exclusively on ""umowa o dzielo"" contracts) or 9% of the total cost of service (when working on ""umowa zlecenia"" contract type). By mixing two types of contracts, it's possible for an independent contrator to pay as low as $10/month for health insurance with incomes exceeding $3000.",1303228845

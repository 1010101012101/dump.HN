I have a real estate site with high traffic, I sell adverts and have adsense too. I suspected I could see directly to these visitors with another spin off that I controlled. So I built an e commerce site selling organic wine (which I suspected would be of interest to the same clientel) and advertised it prominently on the real estate site. Hardly any traffic has resulted from the advert. The bottom line is, if the advert is not on topic with the mode de operation of the user at that specific time it will be ignored.",1208084017

If however it's a specialist app to be used by a trained operator then that may well be the perfect, most optimal and efficient display of the information they (the trained operator) want.<p>Just thought I'd mention that although I agree with your general point speaking as an engineer that has created some crimes against HID and been saved by a designer.",1208083158
162341,story,,,15,17,agentbleu,"Tell YC: The gap between idea and starting development - the longer the better.",,"I have been pondering away over an idea that I had a few months ago, I was writing a blog post about a problem when I had the aha moment, thus, I abandoned the blog post and started conceiving the new application. I spent a week knocking up some rough drafts to explore the technical problems and then got side tracked with another few projects that emerged and needed immediate attention. Since the conception a few months ago, there has been a wealth of other blog articles that have reinforced my initial belief that a desire exists for such an app, but more importantly I have been able to ponder what would be the best way to develop the concept. It's a complicated application so the time to reflect with ones mind open to the challenge while figuring out 'best possible solutions'. As a result I am starting back now on development but with more confidence in the concept and a better understanding of how to best execute the conception. Thus the moral of the story, have an idea, then sit on it for a few months to let the collective blogsphere to fuel the concept with elements that could well make all the difference between a killer app or dead donkey.",1208082390

From the economist article mentioned below:<p><i>The 77-year-old hedge-fund supremo and slayer of sterling has nothing to prove financially (he is worth upwards of $8 billion). Intellectually, however, he has long been frustrated at not being taken seriously. Just as he was about to give up, along came a debacle that, he believes, validates his Weltanschauung</i>.<p>That fits pretty well with the carefully hidden acknowledgement that this isn't news:<p><i>And yet this is not the first time that Mr. Soros has prophesied doom. In 1998, he published a book predicting a global economic collapse that never came.</i><p>This article is about two things: the general hysteria of a generation of workers who have never seen a real recession; and a rich man in his final years trying to leverage his wealth into a legacy.  They're both pandering.<p>Economist article here: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10992042"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1...</a>",1208081671

Don't tell that to my boss - our company's IT system is all Mac :) Seriously, I've been a Mac user for 18 months, and now helping the company test Leopard for roll-out. I'm using a Macbook (the white variety) with a dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM. Yes it's still sluggish and I don't have any background software running.<p>As for modern Linux, I follow the release cycle of the majors. Every six months, I download and test Mandriva and Ubuntu, and sometimes others like Fedora, PC-BSD, and Mint (my pile of test CDs is getting silly). This week, I want to play with SymphonyOne 2008.1 (just released) because the interface is intriguing me. Invariably, on my laptop which is 2+ years old, something is broken.<p>None of them ever figure out my screen res (1280x800) natively. It's an ATI card, so my hopes are high now that AMD has opensourced the drivers.<p>Vista vs ME. Hmm, never thought of that but I think I agree with you!",1208081528

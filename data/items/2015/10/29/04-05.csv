Every time I see a repo for a trivial application that has 100K+ LOC I think, &quot;wow... this person clearly doesn&#x27;t understand how to use package management tools&quot;. Dependencies should be clearly outlined in the config and easily setup using a package manager. You can either download the deps source from your repo or you can download it from a package manager, either way you&#x27;ll need to download it.<p>2. If your dist requires a compilation stage, it will likely generate binaries targeted specifically to the architecture they&#x27;re compiled on. Automating the compilation stage enables users to compile the source to work on their specific architecture (ie hence platform independence).<p>3. Dependencies should be frequently updated and tested against the latest. Not doing so potentially exposes you to bugs and/or security risks that may be included in future updates. If your app has relatively good test coverage there&#x27;s no reason you shouldn&#x27;t be using the latest minor version for all of your dependencies.<p>Not doing so is assuming responsibility for the consequences of running stale code.",1446094568

Generally the realization that all your relationships are shallow is what triggers people to seek out deeper relationships, which need/require love/trust/commitment.

Without additional encryption in use at the application layer, the link from the Tor (hidden service) endpoint and the actual server would not be encrypted and, thus, vulnerable.<p>To (perhaps) explain better, this would be similar to how Cloudflare offers SSL for all sites and while the path from the end user to Cloudflare is (can be) encrypted, the link from Cloudflare back to the origin server isn&#x27;t necessarily encrypted.  Alternatively, think of the link from an SSL terminating device to the backend web servers.

Many good ideas there - but figuring out how to take a simple document and produce <i>simple</i>, <i>modern</i> (preferably somewhat <i>semantic</i>) html for example -- or to produce a decent looking PDF without needing all of LaTeX/Texlive on hand isn&#x27;t easy.<p>Rewriting ReST tools would be a lot of work, but I think if one didn&#x27;t try for 100% backwards (output, plugin) compatibility it might be worthwhile.<p>The astute reader will notice that ReST/Pandoc deals with structured documents, and not really layout for paper/screen (both use TeX/LaTeX as an output target/pipeline). I don&#x27;t know of anything that comes close to TeX/LaTeX for &quot;rasterized&quot; output.<p>On the other hand, I also don&#x27;t know of any package/combination that&#x27;ll make TeX/LaTeX produce anything but messy, 90s-style html -- that generally looks awful. Even if you were to try and force a modern set of CSS down over the resulting mess. If anyone knows of a modern hypertext package for TeX/LaTeX or some similar tool, I&#x27;d be happy to be proven wrong.",1446093961

Or in Quinn&#x27;s case, someone who was demonized as a cheater with no redeeming excuse at all (at first -- and what rationale eventually surfaced was shown to be lies).<p>&quot;Internalized oppression&quot; is a real thing. Not listening to the oppressed is <i>also</i> a real thing. #NotYourShield is misguided because it ignores the first and mocks people who are trying to help because <i>some</i> people do the second. Just because a member of a group doesn&#x27;t feel oppressed doesn&#x27;t make the experience any less real for someone else in that group. I&#x27;ve met minorities who have it all and who insist that they haven&#x27;t encountered prejudice for years, and yet I read other accounts of people who are pulled over and harassed because of the color of their skin. The experience of the first person doesn&#x27;t invalidate the experience of the second.<p>>Please cite the data then.<p>I have, above, several times: personal observations of many tweets with #gamergate combined with boorish claims, plus many different articles by journalists who &quot;dove deep&quot; and tried to find people to talk with about #gg. The &quot;data&quot; you sited was restricted to a few specific &quot;obvious&quot; hate words.<p>And just because I apparently am a glutton for punishment, I just read the top 100 or so tweets on a #gamergate search. Aside from circlejerk-GG-is-awesome-we-are-the-best posts, most were slams of Anita (misquoting her in several), (proud!) reports of the trolling of Brenda Wu, slams of SJWs, or claims that the media was distorting what happened at SXSW. The last was probably the actions of a single bad actor (or a small number of them? and with all of this anti-terrorism technology in place, why haven&#x27;t they CAUGHT them?!), but the media loves an easy narrative, regardless of the truth. The rest of the tweets didn&#x27;t do anything to change my opinion of GG.<p>What kills me is that, if it&#x27;s true, <i>entire stated premise</i> of #gg is naive: Journalism has existed in an ethical grey area since shortly after the printing press was invented.<p>So how do you deal with journalists being too close to those they review? Support <i>good</i> reviewers who are willing to slam games that deserve it.<p>It won&#x27;t <i>hurt</i> to get journalists to admit when they&#x27;re being paid by advertisers, but it won&#x27;t do any actual good either, because most or all journalists benefit from game publisher money or freebies. If every single review ever has a generic &quot;we may have received freebies and/or advertising from this publisher&quot; disclaimer, what have you accomplished? And specific disclaimers won&#x27;t ever happen (for logistical reasons) except if it&#x27;s a publisher like Consumer&#x27;s Reports that <i>never</i> accepts freebies or advertising. And there are <i>very</i> few of those around.<p>So what is it again that you&#x27;re trying to accomplish?<p>P.S. It <i>is</i> a good thing that people donated to causes that help women and/or minorities. I don&#x27;t want to minimize that. But the bulk of people using #gamergate are still using it to promote what I would consider negative-for-society ideas (in a Kant/Moral Imperative sense), so I stand my decision to block most #gamergate-tweeting accounts and generally criticize the hashtag.<p>P.P.S. I am at this point tiring of this discussion. I will cede you the last word if you reply, otherwise it&#x27;s been an interesting chat. Thanks for keeping it civil.

In a &quot;recipe&quot; called Coding Bare-Metal Loops, I recommended a particular loop style as the ultimate in speed...<p>> Use a for loop instead of .each(). To iterate over an array, it’s hard to beat this loop:<p><pre><code>  for( var item, i = −1; item = array[++i] ) {\n      // do stuff with item\n  }\n</code></pre>\n> But there is a catch: this loop works only if your array has no “false” elements, that is, elements whose value is undefined, null, false, 0, or &quot;&quot;. Even with that restriction, this loop is useful in many common cases, such as iterating over a jQuery object.<p>Well... It didn&#x27;t quite turn out that way. This loop style can kick you out of the optimizer because it tries to access the nonexistent element after the end of the array. That&#x27;s perfectly legal in JavaScript, of course - any nonexistent element evaluates as undefined - but code optimizers do not like it when you do that.<p>So a conventional loop turned out to be <i>much</i> faster:<p><a href=""http://jsperf.com/mikes-loops/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/mikes-loops/2</a>",1446093326

Even the consequences of serious errors aren&#x27;t often (maybe even usually) attributed to the source mistake.<p>Like many things, money has driven the status quo (more money in ignoring than acknowledging) and it&#x27;ll drive the solution.

The evidence, in fact, is that women <i>do</i> apply for jobs and are not hired. Blind trials of anonymous resumes show that women would be hired, if only the reader didn&#x27;t know they were women. That once hired, with nearly identical job histories for men and women, men are complimented for leadership qualities and promoted, while women are criticized for being bossy and demanding, and denied raises and promotion.<p>Willfully ignoring these well-documented issues is not the same thing as debating. Coming up with one anecdotal case (that &#x27;constructive contrasting&#x27;) and concluding that nothing should be done because there is no problem, is pretty much classic strawman argument.",1446091470

More recently, Golang recommends Vendoring, and last I heard, refuse to support dependency management, so if anything you should look at their arguments for doing so.<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/2xpulb/the_go_team_officially_recommends_vendoring/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/2xpulb/the_go_team_...</a><p>I do thing this is important to absorb though:<p>Point 1 - a build must always be reproducible and deterministic.\nPoint 2 - a build that pulls in external dependencies relies on its external dependencies to be reproducible and deterministic.<p>When Point 2 is not 100% certain (reliability, changeable artifacts), Point 1 goes out the window. Therefore, Vendoring is a crucial strategy from a build engineering perspective.<p>The most common strategy to mitigate this in a non-vendored build is to have control over the external dependencies by deploying your own dependency platform for your organisation. The latest Artifactory, for example, has proxy support for many mainstream artifact repositories (gems, eggs, dockers, images, modules, bowers, etc.).<p>Now... this project I inherited has had modifications made to the vendored dependencies... <i>smashes desk with head</i>",1446091451

I think writing a good rendering engine is just a ton of work.<p>Two approaches I see as plausible:<p>1. Use TeX as a &quot;document assembly language&quot; of sorts, a pure back-end rendering target not exposed to the user, and do your document markup/scripting in some other front-end language. Pandoc [1] is a start at building infrastructure for this. You can then build a new renderer too if you want, to remove the dependency on TeX, but at least in the meantime you have a pathway to producing quality output right now.<p>2. Build something on top of HTML+CSS (maybe also +JS). Advantages of this would be that it&#x27;d make it relatively easy to target the web with the same document source, and open-source web browsers have already sunk a ton of development time into rendering. CSS even includes a bunch of print-oriented features that in principle provide markup for most of what you might need here, though browsers for obvious reasons haven&#x27;t tended to prioritize those parts. wkhtmltopdf [2] is a project aiming to build a to-print or to-PDF document workflow on top of Webkit. However imo the results are still not near TeX-replacement level. I believe the gold standard currently, if you want high-quality print out of HTML+CSS, is the proprietary PrinceXML [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://pandoc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pandoc.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wkhtmltopdf.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wkhtmltopdf.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.princexml.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princexml.com/</a>",1446091314

In that specific situation, if anyone &quot;defects&quot; (provides the canary key), it&#x27;s a crime, and everyone can go down for conspiracy, even if they themselves provided a valid key (which, in this scenario, is something we&#x27;re assuming couldn&#x27;t be proven anyway) and even if they never intended to break the law. That&#x27;s the key part of a conspiracy prosecution - it doesn&#x27;t matter <i>which</i> participant actually committed the crime, all the participants can be tried as if they were the &quot;trigger-man&quot;.<p>TBH I&#x27;m not up for tracking all this down in the US legal code (got stuff to do, and IANAL), but here&#x27;s the statute in the California penal code:<p><a href=""http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/penal-code/pen-sect-182.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/penal-code/pen-sect-182.html</a><p>Note, in particular (heavily snipped for brevity/relevance):<p>> (a) If two or more persons conspire: [snip] (5) To commit any act injurious to the public health, to public morals, or to pervert or obstruct justice, or the due administration of the laws.<p>> They are punishable as follows: [snippity snippity snip....] When they conspire to commit any other felony, they shall be punishable in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided for the punishment of that felony.<p>There&#x27;s no provision that the conspirators (or the prosecution) know <i>which</i> of their number actually committed the crime.<p>None of this would be relevant for HSMs on devices that aren&#x27;t part of an investigation, or in general, any situation except one where a group of people are being legally compelled to enable access to evidence.<p>The bigger-picture point is just that using a split-key mechanism to give plausible deniability to each individual key-holder doesn&#x27;t actually pose any problem for the criminal justice system.

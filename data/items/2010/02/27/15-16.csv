This copies the contents of My Documents and Desktop (or wherever) to a Venti[2] server running on Linux on the LAN. The storage arenas of that server are extracted in 500Mb chunks and encrypted, along with the scores for accessing them, using GPG[3]. These are then copied offsite, via the internet and bundled into DVD sized groups and burned to optical when appropriate. As Venti arenas are append only this is minimum transfer, secure backup.\nThat's obviously just the Windows machiens that use Limbo. Unix likes have native clients. Our Venti store also contains data from other soruces such as the website and imap servers. Though it might make sense to separate them out, that's the decisions I'm working on as I go along.<p>I would also like to find an encryption method that uses fixed size chunks so I can upload only the appended data.

There are plenty of applications which do real things for real people which will <i>never</i> have scaling issues associated with them.  The vast majority of the remainder of applications will have issues which are tractable by fairly simple solutions.  And then we get to the pathbreakers who have to invent new methods of engineering to keep up with their growth curves.<p>The party is just getting started for ""Hey, check it: we can put a cache in front of our database"" for that broad middle of the curve.  (This includes applications where relational databases are a great fit but for certain performance requirements in small bits of the program.  For example, you <i>really</i> don't want to have to implement a university backend system in a key/value store.  Just trust me on this one.  It is virtually made for SQL, but while 99% of the use of the system is less than performance intensive, having resources in place to support that last 1% costs the university hundreds of thousands of dollars.  I think we could slash that with creative caching.)",1267285951

1155359,comment,1155252,1155252,0,0,CoryOndrejka,,,"""Any achievement in a video game is a fake achievement""<p>This is a great soundbite to build an essay around but ignores two decades of learning, cognitive, and psychological research. There are too many examples to try to pack into a comments, but among the most obvious:<p>- 3D games are have been demonstrated to have positive effects on spatial perception and to allow rehearsal-based training for real-world activities (<a href=""http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/SeriousGames4thePolice_AhmedBinSubaih-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/SeriousGames4thePolice_Ah...</a>)<p>- Medical education in virtual worlds has also demonstrated the efficacy of training in synthetic worlds (<a href=""http://www.jmir.org/2010/1/e1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jmir.org/2010/1/e1/</a>)<p>- Massively multiplayer games' positive impact on literacy (<a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.114.4968&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.114...</a>)<p>Easy to go on and on, but the short answer is that it is preposterous to dismiss technologically mediated achievement as somehow fake.<p>The author's other points about variable-reward based training and the lure of positive feedback are also well researched fields. Since Skinner we've seen evidence that small amounts of positive reinforcement with some randomness -- called variable reinforcement -- generates the largest behavioral changes and longest engagement, so it should come as no surprise that achievement games -- like gambling -- engage a large number of people.<p>Of course, the 30,000' view of the article -- that variable reward games can consume a large amount of time and may not be making the player's life better -- is true. However, the simple assertions that games are fake and hurt their players are simply not supported by the data.

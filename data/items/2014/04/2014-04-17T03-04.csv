7601944,comment,7601679,7601936,3,0,pcwalton,,,"> Are there any known undefined behavior in the Rust language? Since UB is one of the most notable item that makes safety by compiler not a guarantee.<p>There are bugs in the implementation, but the language is specified to have no undefined behavior. (Note that some things are left <i>unspecified</i>, such as the memory layout of enums and vtables and the sorting algorithm that `sort` uses, but there is no undefined behavior in the C sense.)<p>> Also, how can we guarantee the compiler doing the check properly? Is it hard? My interpretation is that safety relies on the correctness of the compiler from that quote.<p>We can&#x27;t guarantee that the implementation is correct without writing a full-on certified compiler, but we&#x27;re working on a theoretical proof of correctness of the type system.<p>Issues relating to compiler correctness do come up in the real world, and occasionally they lead to vulnerabilities. However, such issues are much rarer than issues stemming from undefined behavior documented as such in the C/C++ standards. So we&#x27;re more focused on eliminating undefined behavior from the Rust <i>language</i> at the moment than proving the Rust <i>implementation</i> correct.",1397707111

The problem with spam is that 1) it&#x27;s noise and 2) appears in large amounts.<p>Captchas approach the problem 1), by assuring only people can post and then hopefully increase the signal quality. It sucks because it requires mental effort, is hard on people with disabilities, blocks potentially useful bots (see reddit bots) and leads to an arms race.<p>What if we tried to solve the problem 2)? One possible solution is requiring a proof of work. Some computation that requires a few seconds, easily disguised while the user is typing the comment or filling the fields.

7601939,comment,7601802,7601802,3,0,Aloha,,,"I strongly believe that there is only enough spectrum for three strong national carriers - Right now neither T-Mobile or Sprint has enough spectrum capacity on their own to be truly competitive, with AT&T and even more so, Verizon, if Sprint and T-Mo were to merge, it&#x27;d be a very different picture.<p>You cannot built a nationwide LTE network on 2.5 ghz - the required tower density is too great to ever get a workable rate of return on investment. You need 1900 mhz or lower - even at 1900, the tower spacing is close. Ideally, you&#x27;d have a mix of 800/1900 with 800 mhz providing a single LTE carrier, and a single 2G/3G carrier (or more where spectrum allows), then 1900 and 2.5 would be used in rural, urban and suburban areas to provide real capacity where needed. Sprint is doing this now, rolling out LTE and CDMA 1x on the former iDEN spectrum as it rolls out LTE, with CDMA2000 and LTE on 1900 as well - then in some places the 2.5 network from clearwire is being overlayed on top - the CW network has been upgraded for LTE, and the 2.5 deployment is starting for the new LTE hardware as well.<p>For true national reach though, they need more spectrum - its possible to provide at least 2/2mbps broadband to everyone nationwide - but not the way its being done - if this spectrum can be auctioned with some left aside for the smaller carriers, it might just change that game, otherwise merger is required.",1397707013

However at its core, it&#x27;s still just a text-based statistical search engine. It has no ability to &quot;learn&quot; new abilities. Its algorithms will use previous answers to adjust ranking of answers, but once a category is finished, that data is lost. For new data, its database needs to be re-indexed. For new behavior like recognizing pictures or playing a game, it needs to be programmed.<p>Watson played a simplified version of Jeopardy with no video or audio questions. This was a key compromise to allow a text based system to compete with humans. The AI problem of recognizing pictures is practically unsolved. It took Google&#x27;s best researchers, a massive database of cat pictures, and a supercomputer just to train a computer to recognize when a cat was in a photo.

Maybe it&#x27;s a failing in that team <i>(teams typically track operation load carefully, as it can serve as an early indicator of something in the team dynamics going wrong)</i>, that team might be under pressure from management to push out new features on a tight schedule <i>(leaving less time to get things right, or to fix known issues)</i>, they may have had the unfortunate luck of inheriting a service written quick and dirty by one of the VP&#x27;s favored &quot;get shit done fast&quot; teams <i>(a problematic phenomenon that fortunately seems to be becoming less common)</i>, or it may just be the nature of their particular work for whatever reason.<p>I <i>have</i> seen teams with extremely high operation load get support teams based out of other timezones, so that 24/7 ops coverage can be done mostly by people working during their regional business hours.

But American society has for some bizarre reason decided that home ownership is the sine qua non of human civilization and so every level of government intervenes to distort the market in favor of homeownership.<p>The thing is?  Leases are... very inflexible.  In many ways, it&#x27;s less flexible than buying.   Here is the essential problem:  If I have a rational, profit-maximizing landlord, every time my lease is up for renewal, he increases my rent to what it would cost me to rent an equivalent place elsewhere plus just under what it would cost me to move.    On the other side of that, if I take a longer lease, I&#x27;m in a seriously bad position if something changes in my life and I need to move.<p>This is especially dramatic in commercial real-estate, where the business owner is usually asked to personally co-sign the lease, and where there are fewer laws requiring the landlord to reasonably try to rent vacant units to other people.   (and where the tenant is more likely to be able to keep paying rent after moving.)<p>Three to five years of rent is nearly always more than 6% of the purchase price of the property.",1397705088

MakerBot started as a clone of Rep Rap. Arduino was created on top of Processing IDE. Amazon AWS wouldn&#x27;t exist if it wasn&#x27;t for Xen. Raspberry Pi was created on top of Linux. I feel it&#x27;s exactly the same with 3D Robotics (or better; e.g., MakerBot&#x27;s contribution is highly controversial).<p>Having said that, I agree that his profile and this talk wasn&#x27;t a good fit for DEFCON. It&#x27;d be a better fit for Solid, or other O&#x27;Reilly conference.<p>[1] <a href=""http://diydrones.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diydrones.com/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://ardupilot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ardupilot.com/</a>",1397703979

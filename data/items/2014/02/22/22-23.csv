The truth is, it&#x27;s not going to actually <i>be</i> motivating you most days, but since you&#x27;re going to be slogging regardless, you need to make sure you&#x27;re slogging towards something that you consider to be worthwhile.<p>For some people it&#x27;s family, for others it&#x27;s money, for some it&#x27;s a particular sport, for some it&#x27;s owning their own business. For some it&#x27;s writing, for others it&#x27;s photography, or music. For some it&#x27;s being a respected member of their community.<p>Think to yourself, who are the people you most respect? When you&#x27;re 40, what kind of a person do you want to be? What kind of success will be most important to you? The answer might not always be immediately clear or obvious, but a vague idea can still help point you in the right direction.<p>But also: nobody can slog away at the same thing all the time, so make sure you make plenty of room for friends, fun, exercise/sport, romantic attachment, and whatnot. As long as you have those kinds of things, you&#x27;ll find you can deal with the slog after all. And in the end, they&#x27;re really what life is mostly about. :)",1393109735

How much would it impact someone, say yourself, to kill someone by inducing an Athsma attack on your lunch break?<p>Further, it&#x27;s already the case that laws exist to make certain behaviors illegal for the very reason that they inconvenience other people, not because they cause harm. That includes being excessively noisy and producing foul odors in some cases, among many other things.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned today is that there are a lot of inconsiderate assholes on Hacker News. Be it out of general apathy of others or just sheer stupidity. I&#x27;d have argued the latter could not have been the case many months ago, but given the recent discussions and new posters, it seems to be a contender.

At any point, if people are dissatisfied with the captain, they can overthrow them and reelect a new one (though not during chases or battles).<p>The bit that rings home with this article though, is that the captain generally had to eat with the crew members. If any one of the crew members decided they liked the captains meal better then theirs, the captain would have to swap.<p>Apparently, this helped to ensure some humbleness in the captain. Even though they called the shots, they were not this mystical being that nobody saw, interacted with, or felt out of touch with.<p>I think the tying of the presidents salary to that of his cleaners is a good example of this.

Teaching your brain to understand this is the struggle the OP faces.<p>BTW especially with maths, teachers mostly fail at providing any context above &#x27;learn this rule, so you can apply a slightly more advanced version of it next year&#x27;. There is a huge amount of context and thought around the mathematics that&#x27;s being taught, but little effort ever goes into expounding it.

7283853,comment,7282618,7282618,2,0,Theodores,,,"The problem with education is that it always has a different take on a subject to what personally fascinates you about the subject. Subjects that might have floated your boat personally for many years will be taught differently to what you expect, killing your interest in a subject.<p>There is an adage about teaching - if you cannot do then teach, if you cannot teach then teach Geography. If we take Geography as an example, you might think of geography as being about places on a map, be able to name all U.S. state capitals and know where Dhaka is and Dakar isn&#x27;t. Then, in a geography class, you might find that knowing where anywhere is does not matter in the least. &#x27;How flood plains are formed&#x27;, &#x27;how a volcano works&#x27; will be what is taught, without any mention at all of physical places.<p>The geography example is an example of how expectations of a subject can be wrong at the basic school level, you can live with a mis-match of expectations in geography syllabus, however, go to university and it is another kettle of fish. You might think politics would be a useful thing to study, be passionate about the subject and be knowledgeable about current affairs. Again, none of that would matter.<p>Computer science is another area of concern. You might be good at programming and be up to date with whatever is on HN. Yet, at university you might get taught languages and methodologies that are a world away. There might actually be reasons why the university teach what they teach that are not readily apparent. The military might have some link up that means that stuff that matters to designing jet fighters gets taught. Clearly none of it - &#x27;ADA&#x27; - for instance - might have no relevance in the real world.<p>Returning to your subject of maths, in the real world you are doing pretty well if you have problems that require secondary school stuff - trigonometry, calculating prices with tax, differential equations. Actually you could probably go a long way on getting a man on the moon with secondary school maths, yet there is a whole world of maths beyond that. Triple integrations, anyone? Even if you do find a real world use - electronics with Gauss&#x27;s theorem - there aren&#x27;t many uses for that real world use. It is all too convenient for maths to be taught in such a way that it is abstract and not practical, e.g. teaching a program to do it for you, or working on a large dataset in a computationally efficient way. Even reading the data in is not something that would be taught. It is a bit like how you can do a degree in electronics and never touch a soldering iron or know how to fix a fuse.<p>So my suggestion is to not head off to university so hastily. Work somewhere for a little while then go to university because you know why you are going. You can actually learn useful stuff at university rather than go there to just get a bit of paper.",1393107193

Preventing people to sending money to (or receiving money from) a list of bad actors is a horridly difficult thing to begin with, but then when they screw up (either like this or in the more common case of money getting through), placing the blame is easy.<p>On another note, I haven&#x27;t the faintest idea what the meaning of &quot;blue sky&quot; is, and I can&#x27;t find anything by searching.

Relationships with your friends start to change as you grow up at different rates (I don&#x27;t know whether this applies to you), interests change, and you have so little energy it feels like an effort to get out of bed before noon. Some things that worked for me were hanging out with some different, more studious people, and learning the course material from books in the order I chose rather than following the course (I missed a lot of classes, but I would&#x27;t recommend that). Make a game out of getting the grades that will be your ticket out of there! On a serious note, if you think you might be depressed, talk to someone (a doctor or counsellor) about it.",1393106627

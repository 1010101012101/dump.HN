6892878,comment,6892754,6892754,12,0,smtddr,,,"<i>>>If you’re dependent on YouTube for making money from video content, that’s disastrous, as even a single strike against your YouTube account can limit the account’s functionality within the site and impact anything from the length of videos you’re able to upload to your ability to monetise those videos with advertising.</i><p>Always be very careful when your business depends on the free(AFAIK, uploading to youtube is free) services & regulations of some other company. I can&#x27;t help but think of the stories on Facebook-platform/API dependency. That said, I still think it&#x27;s bad how Google isn&#x27;t a bit more careful when considering that, intentional or not, they now hold several people&#x27;s livelihood in their hands. Semi-arbitrarily dropping sites&#x27; page-rank, marking sites as phishing attempts or messing with youtube-accounts&#x27; abilities to continue their business by some automation-script is kinda harsh. It&#x27;s kinda like a guilty-until-proven-innocent thing where you just wake up one day and find your youtube-channel crippled. You&#x27;re losing money while trying to contact Google and get everything straightened out. The fact that Google isn&#x27;t exactly known for amazing customer service adds to the problem. I certainly don&#x27;t expect Google to manually check all that content, but how about instead of immediate penalty... they send an email with a warning that action will be taken in 20 business days if alleged-offending content isn&#x27;t removed. At least give the uploaders a chance to fix the issue or plan for an &quot;outage&quot; of sorts. Perhaps even for websites & youtube channels that are well known high-traffic & monetizing, Google makes sure to white-list them so they can never be auto-penalized without a human confirming. Instead, it just triggers an alert to all parties involved so people can look at it.",1386824242

How can users get services equal to or better than those offered by Google/Facebook/Yahoo/... without centralized &quot;cloud&quot; computing? How are the developers going to support themselves financially?<p>I love and support the efforts of FSF. Almost all of my scientific work rests upon a GNU footing. But before distributed software can eat the centralized software world, it has to be equal or better. This is no different from global warming; if solar power were cheap and effective, nobody would be burning coal.<p>Even when code is open-sourced, and alternatives are available (gitlab, anyone?) users still flock to centralized services like github. I do, with repos at github. I served my own mail, read it with mutt, and filtered my own spam in the past on my own server. GMail is <i>way</i> better at all three of those things, and I don&#x27;t have to burn a couple of man-days/year keeping configuration up to snuff.<p>The unstoppable advantage of free software is that it&#x27;s a ratchet.

They must have a spreadsheet tracking passenger complaints somewhere.  Let&#x27;s increment that while having someone commit, on paper, to a version of events of what happened and a legal rationale to why that was justified.  This will only cost me a bit of time and money, and I have lots of time and money, but it has heavily asymmetric payoff in the event of a lawsuit or PR battle.<p>But honestly?  Mathematically, I&#x27;m much, much more at risk of getting mugged in Chicago on my way home from the airport than getting held up by Customs.  I don&#x27;t exactly live in fear of muggings but I take sensible precautions like e.g. backing up my data, making sure that I can turn a factory-new laptop into a working dev environment within a day, and carrying insurance.  I&#x27;m pretty sure most of these still work even if I happen to lose a laptop to Customs rather than to a mugger.",1386821711

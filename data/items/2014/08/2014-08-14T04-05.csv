8176146,comment,8174143,8174143,2,0,pdkl95,,,"Problem:<p>PGP is complicated (VERY complicated, to the average user), resulting in next to zero adoption.<p>Suggestion:<p>Simplify the goals in a way that can be upgraded at at some later date.<p>I think we need a browser plugin (All browsers. Other non-browser tools too, ideally, but the browser is important) that lets you securely <i>SIGN</i> posts locally in a style more or less like GPG&#x27;s --clearsign option. Ideally, this should <i>literally be</i> --clearsign for compatibility, with the plugin hiding the &quot;---- BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE ----&quot; headers/footers, though these details are less important.<p>The key should be automagically generated, and stored locally in a secure way. (Bonus points for leting you use the keyrings in ~/.gnupg/ as an advanced, optional feature). The UI goal is to simply let people post things and click a <i>sign this</i> button next to a <textarea> or similar. Ideally, later on, this could become sign-by-default.<p>On the other side, the browser plugin should notice signed blocks of text and authenticate them. Pubkeys are saved locally (key pinning). What this provides is 1) verification that posts are actually by the same author, and 2) it proves that someone is the same author <i>cross-domain</i> (or as different accounts/usernames).<p>No attempt is made to tie the key to some external identity (though this would be somewhat easy for to prove). The idea is to remove the authentication problem (keyservers/pki) entirely. This can be man-in-the-middled, but the MitM would have to be working 100% of the time or the change in key will be noticed.<p>No attempt is made regarding encryption (hiding the message). This should also greatly simplify the interface.<p>The goal here is to get people using proper (LOCAL STORE <i>ONLY</i>) public/private keys. The UI should be little more than a [sign this] button that handles everything, and a <sig ok!> icon on the reading side. It should be possible to get the average user to understand and use such a tool.<p><i>Later</i>, when the idea of signing your posts has become more widespread and <i>many people have a valid public/private key pair already in use</i>, other features can be added back in. As those &quot;2nd generation&quot; tools have a large pool of keys to draw from, it should be easier to start some variant of Web Of Trust. Even if that never happens, getting signing widespread <i>is</i> useful on its own.<p>I realize this doesn&#x27;t protect against a large number of well-known attacks, and only offers mild protection against MitM. This is intentional, as the goal is getting people to actually <i>use</i> some minimal subset of PGP/GPG-like tools, possibly as an educational exercise. The rest of the stuff can be addressed later.",1407991899
8176145,comment,8175453,8175494,2,0,superuser2,,,"> (1) Developer ease of use<p>You can&#x27;t fix it with developer tools. You&#x27;d need to completely rewrite the way many hundreds of thousands of diverse, entrenched, autonomous entities with a vested interest in your failure think about networking.<p>Most users are behind NAT. Several thousand employees in an office or students in a dorm will have the same public IP address and will never, under any circumstances, administer the router where NATing takes place.<p>For users who do not pay their own ISP bills, it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i>. By design. You are not going to convince the entire IT management/security establishment that they should allow arbitrary connections to their users&#x27; machines.<p>With unlimited resources and political power, you might be able to convince all the SOHO router manufacturers to include some kind of standardized port-forwarding API. It will be several years before all the old devices are replaced, though. But you might get to a point where there are peer-to-peer systems for nontechnical users who own their routers.<p>You still need client-server for when people are on an institutional connection/mobile.<p>There are no peer-to-peer connections between users behind firewalls or NAT. This is true even in BitTorrent - if you&#x27;re behind a firewall, your only peers are people who are not behind firewalls (seedboxes in datacenters, geeks who went into their router config, and people who are wasting IPv4 space by handing out fully routable IPs to individual clients.)",1407991882

8176137,comment,8170071,8172683,2,0,MichaelGG,,,"CentOS and Windows, Xeon 5400 series CPUs - cheap used Dells. OpenSIPS, FreeSWITCH, RabbitMQ, SQL Server, VoltDB, and a custom DB. We have a few hundred million routes loaded at any given time and run up to 50,000 calls/sec. SQL Server is going to get phased out in favour of Postgres, due to SQL Server&#x27;s increasing licensing costs. ElasticSearch also looks like it might be a good candidate for crunching up a bunch of records.<p>All critical code is F# on Mono and CLR. Each voice-handling machine makes an HTTP request to a CLR process to get routing instructions, then the results of the call are handed off to a Mono process, which protobufs stuff into a local RabbitMQ instance, which gets shoveled into billing, analysis, etc.<p>Lots of &quot;XML&quot;, as that&#x27;s FreeSWITCH&#x27;s preferred format (it&#x27;s not real XML, but a psuedo-XML with inane encoding rules, for some reason). This is the cause of at least 20% CPU time when handling call records.<p>In general, scaling out by adding a few more machines to the mix is so easy we&#x27;re not really pressed hard to make things go faster. But it&#x27;s certainly fun to do. I&#x27;d guess we can improve many pieces up over 100% without doing anything really tricky.<p>As a comparison, I know of at least one successful competitor that has everything in PHP. Every call creates multiple processes and multiple (10+ sometimes) DB queries. Their entire scale-out process is to throw hardware at things. At one point they had over 100(!) servers just to hold call records (maybe 100M a month?). Inefficient? Hilariously so. Did the primary owners get rich from it? Absolutely. Engineering quality counts for surprisingly little, when it really comes down to it.",1407991597

You&#x27;d still have (at most) 1 memory lookup for any route (1 lookup in SRAM, 1 in RAM, worst case), but you&#x27;d need something like 256M of ram instead of 16 gigs. Vast majority of packets (going to < /24 routes) would be routed in < 10 ns, and the 130 ms becomes a 140ms worst-case. With average < 10ns routing suddenly having one of these processors for, let&#x27;s say, 160 Gbit worth of ports becomes possible. And I&#x27;m sure your customers would immediately ask you to put 320G of ports on that processor.<p>(Principle of a trie is that IP address is a.b.c.d.

Everyone is a part of a persecuted minority now, which has the simultaneous benefits of justifying the suffering of others (i.e. they deserve it), and providing a nice scapegoat for their own suffering (it&#x27;s the goddamn liberals, red-staters, intellectuals, Hollywood, christian fundamentalists, etc. etc.). It allows people to be angry about their situation (which is unavoidable) while keeping that anger totally impotent.

My company has been experimenting w/ different options for technical interviews.<p>Our current tool of choice is GoToMeeting, mostly because it offers video/audio chat, screen sharing, keyboard sharing.  Most importantly, GoToMeeting seems to consume least amount of bandwidth, which makes is more reliable for interviewing candidates w/ slower Internet connections.  The main problem with GoToMeeting is that it&#x27;s clunky, and the licensing options are a pain in the butt.  It&#x27;s not uncommon for one interviewer to log in w/ the credentials we use, only to kick out another interviewer.  Scheduling is kind of a pain in the butt, too.<p>I&#x27;m going to recommend we try out Codassium.  I&#x27;ve played with it a little bit, and it looks awesome so far.  I have one feature request that would be awesome for us.  Give users the ability to set the resolution for the webcam image.  When audio & video become choppy, allowing someone to use a lower resolution could mean the difference between completing or having to reschedule the interview.  How well you manage bandwidth could also mean the difference between winning & keeping us as a customer :)",1407988910

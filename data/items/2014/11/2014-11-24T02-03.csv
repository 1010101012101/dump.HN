I actually did propose doing this in a general way here: <a href=""https://github.com/aaronc/freactive.core/blob/master/UI-SPEC.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aaronc/freactive.core/blob/master/UI-SPEC...</a> and started making a separate lib for just the data types: <a href=""https://github.com/aaronc/freactive.core"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aaronc/freactive.core</a>. The idea is to make it easy to work with many platforms.<p>2. That&#x27;s the idea. Did you check to the performance demo (<a href=""http://aaronc.github.io/freactive/dom-perf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aaronc.github.io/freactive/dom-perf/</a>)? I can&#x27;t claim all the kinks have been ironed out... but the idea is to optimize performance.<p>Overall, I can&#x27;t really say the idea of a reactive UI library for Clojure is anything new - this library is simply a pure Clojurescript (as opposed to React.js-based) library that aims to have have good performance and a simple and consistent programming model. Doing it in pure Clojurescript I think makes it easy to optimize performance, support complex animations and do things in a Clojure-like way.",1416797697

Playing several sounds like magic. The thing is though that at certain level almost anybody can play decent blindfolded game, especially vs much weaker opponent. Playing several takes some practice but it&#x27;s mainly connected with not being confused (anchoring positions to something so it&#x27;s easy to switch). It&#x27;s really not that much more taxing on the brain as chess players have tons of positions memorized anyway.  
I am talking about 2-3-4 games. 10 is already very impressive to me and things like 20+ is insane even for competitive chess player standards.",1416797633

Granted, you <i>can</i> use ssh-keys with tokens -- my recommendation is to use encrypted ssh-keys paired with a recent[1] openssh server that allows stacking OTP on top, for 2fa with the RequiredAuthentication-directive (well, OTP is generally code for: can demonstrate access to OTP secret) -- but at least it is rather easy to store the two on separate devices (say a phone, and on the filesystem of your workstation/laptop). Not really maximum security, but quite a lot better than traditional passwords.<p>Until you store both the key and the authenticator on your phone, in order to use ssh from your phone. At which point you end up with &quot;rather convoluted 1fa&quot; -- which might still be marginally better than traditional passwords (along with a warm fuzzy feeling of false security :-).<p>Other than that I&#x27;ve been looking into using openssh certificates with openssh, but it still looks like it&#x27;s rather complicated -- and for a single-/few-user setup it&#x27;s questionable if the expiration etc really adds much actual security.<p>Maybe the best would be to apply some of the kerberos design lessons to openssh with certificates, issuing short-lived certs much like kerberos ticket-granting tickets (so have an easy way to get a user certificate that&#x27;s valid for 8 hours or so...).

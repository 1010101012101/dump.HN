6806256,comment,6805958,6805958,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Hah, it would be interesting if Cassey replies. It would be more effective to write them a letter and post it to them. No doubt 99% of the replys to the email are &quot;no such address&quot; or &quot;user email inbox is full&quot; or something equally un-germane to the process of recruiting. As a system administrator you could write to the President of the University and explain to them how Cassey appears to be wasting college resources with an ineffective spamming campaign but mention that if you were a student there, pursuing your Masters degree, you would also be available on a work study basis to help Drexel develop a much more accurate and useful student recruitment tool, this would greatly enhance the value to Drexel of having you be part of their program.",1385524766

See, your above.<p>Yeah... but like I said, I don&#x27;t believe people who claim heroic hours.   I don&#x27;t believe companies who say that &#x27;50-60 hours&#x27; is normal.   they mean that /claiming/ 50 hours a week is normal.<p>Yes, some people do actually work brutal hours, but they don&#x27;t brag about it.  They worry that they aren&#x27;t working enough.   Some employers really pressure people to work brutal hours, but they brag about that even less.<p>In fact, the places that claim heroic  hours more often have beer Fridays and unfiltered internet access (and a culture that makes it okay to hang out on facebook and HN on work hours.)  Generally, they also let you come in when you want, meaning that you can show up before your boss (It doesn&#x27;t matter how much before your boss)  /or/ show up after your boss (it doesn&#x27;t matter how much after your boss)   and plausibly claim crazy hours.<p>There is /extreme/ resistance to any sort of actual time tracking for this reason.<p>It&#x27;s like the coaches who say &quot;give 110%&quot;  yeah, they are irritating, and the rest of us look down on them, but there is a group of people who eat that shit up.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but even if you are spending 45 or even 50 hours a week in the office (and the number of folks who go beyond that, ninja rockstar or not, is vanishingly small[1])  if half of that time is spent socializing or screwing off on the internet?   it&#x27;s not really that brutal.

Before the NFLPA&#x27;s recognition in 1970, players usually worked second jobs to make ends meet. It was only after unionization (and, to a significant degree after the &#x27;82 and &#x27;87 strikes) that players received the kind of salaries we see today.

When you want to build something that is big or that will evolve into big, choose a better language and don&#x27;t rely on a framework to save you. In fact even big apps are better broken up into many separate functional apps integrated by things like an RDBMS or a message queue broker or a NoSQL cluster.<p>And you really need to think hard about caching.

6806145,comment,6803616,6805438,3,0,robomartin,,,"> Frankly, there&#x27;s not really that much to know<p>Sure.  A couple of blog posts and everyone is an expert.<p>Physical products encompass a very wide range of disciplines.  You would be monumentally wrong to think that component purchasing is the most difficult aspect of bringing physical products to market successfully.<p>It&#x27;s almost like saying that money is the only variable in building good websites, or the choice of a language or framework.  The fact is that software development is a very complex art, often requiring expertise in a wide range of disciplines.<p>Yes, I know, in my prior post I said &quot;software is easy&quot; and now I am saying the exact opposite.  I meant it in relative terms.  An individual or a team with the right skill set can hack away and create a world-class software product with free tools, in their bathrobes, in a dorm room.  They can deploy it to thousands of people, modify, fine-tune, fix and even pivot the product with little if any cost.  College kids right out of school (or even before) can develop and offer significant software products.<p>Hardware or physical products are not like that.  It is rare to have recent grads or drop-outs have the necessary skills to complete such projects.  They require a lot of money and multi-disciplinary expertise.  These days this generally means expertise in mechanical, electrical and software engineering as well as manufacturing, supply chain management, quality control, testing and more.  Depending on what you are doing each of those disciplines often require domain expertise in sub-specialties.  For example, electrical engineering ranges from analog and digital design to signal and power integrity --crucial for high-speed designs.<p>In addition to that, hardware products require expensive specialized tools and often years of expertise using them.  Laying out a 12 layer circuit board for an FPGA board with signals ranging into the GHz range isn&#x27;t something one is going to do with a free PCB layout tool and a handful of online tutorials.  The machine I am typing this on has somewhere close to $50,000 in software tools installed --EDA, CAD, CAM, FEA, Field Solvers, Compilers, etc.  The cost of the PC itself is a rounding error when compared to the cost of the software, the annual licensing and support agreements as well as the training costs.<p>Outside of that, depending on what you are doing, you might need tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in standard and specialized test equipment and tools.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way.  YC funds startups to the tune of $15K to $20K to develop the first incarnation of a software product.  Just one of our DSO&#x27;s (Digital Storage Oscilloscope) costs nearly twice that much.  The point isn&#x27;t to boast --we are small potatoes-- but rather to try to impress upon you that the hardware game is very, very different than doing software and the variables involved go far beyond how and where you buy your components or whether your Excel spreadsheet with your BOM is formatted correctly.<p>I could go on.

There are plenty of jobs in the industry which, on paper, look similar to this one. Low pay, lots of responsibilities, on call duties, poor work/life balance, etc. But PA isn&#x27;t a normal company so a lot of the assumptions going into some of the conclusions people are drawing are erroneous.<p>PA is a family, which is something that a lot of startups pretend to but which is actually true in this case. The people there don&#x27;t just eat lunch together they spend a lot of time in and out of the office with each other, and they tend to have pretty strong bonds of friendship with each other. The majority of people working at PA didn&#x27;t interview to work there. PA tends to hire by osmosis when it can, because &quot;cultural fit&quot; is by far the most important factor. It&#x27;s a very challenging prospect to try to hire someone into a very close nit group of friends, even more so when the job you&#x27;re trying to hire for has fairly high skill requirements.<p>Personally I think that this job requires a fairly unusual candidate, but I think there&#x27;s a good chance such a candidate exists. And I don&#x27;t mean &quot;unusual&quot; in terms of being a &quot;rockstar&quot; or someone filled with self-hatred or low self-esteem.<p>So, let me correct (or confirm) some perceptions. This isn&#x27;t a &quot;death march&quot; job like you&#x27;d expect in game dev or many startups. Yeah you may have to work late sometimes, and there may be weeks when you&#x27;re chugging red bull, but a lot of that is up to you and how you do development, set expectations, and so on. This isn&#x27;t healthcare.gov, it&#x27;s mostly a bunch of content-heavy sites. You can certainly get into a crunch if you don&#x27;t manage your time or your projects well but that&#x27;s within your control, and you can certainly push back as much as is necessary. Unlike most startups you&#x27;re not going to be expected to be in crunch mode all the time and you&#x27;re not going to be expected to put in a set number of hours per week. If you do good work and prioritize well you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>In terms of being on call, again it&#x27;s not as though this is reddit or healthcare.gov or amazon.com, it&#x27;s a handful of CMS deployments and a few other things. Things can, and will, go down, and the fact that you&#x27;re pretty much the only person available to fix a lot of this stuff is definitely going to suck. But the sorts of problems you&#x27;re going to run into aren&#x27;t the same sorts of things you&#x27;ll see at a typical startup. Maybe the load balancer for some site isn&#x27;t working right or something, so you&#x27;ll go file a support ticket w/ the VPS provider or fix it yourself as warranted. This isn&#x27;t a job where you&#x27;ll expect to have to get out of bed at 3am at least once a week to have to fix some bullshit code that someone else wrote. You have the opportunity to make the system work as smoothly as possible, and if you find yourself getting woken up by monitoring alerts too often that&#x27;s probably due more to the choices you&#x27;ve made than anything else.<p>The reason why the job listing asks for people with a &quot;crazy person level of attention to detail&quot; is because you will be the entirety of the dev team (but there are designers, so you&#x27;re not the whole universe). There&#x27;s no QA team and not really any project management other than what you do. And accountability primarily comes from intrinsic motivation, not from someone looking over your shoulder.<p>As far as IT support and DBA, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very difficult requirement for a lot of devs to satisfy. It&#x27;s not as though you have to do tech support for an office of mundanes, pretty much everyone at PA is tech savvy, the only thing you&#x27;re there to do is be a resource to maybe solve some of the problems they can&#x27;t, and to babysit the office infrastructure as necessary. If you feel comfortable setting up a managed switch (with the help of documentation) and building your own PC from parts you&#x27;ll probably be fine.<p>The really bad news is that you&#x27;re going to be taking a pay cut most likely. There just isn&#x27;t the same opportunity to make as much money as you could in other parts of the industry. If you think you can negotiate a more competitive salary, then you can certainly try, I wouldn&#x27;t rule it out. You&#x27;ll still make okay money, if money isn&#x27;t a big factor for you then it&#x27;ll probably be fine, it should be enough to live wherever you want and have plenty of disposable income. But compared to what you could make in a profitable startup or at one of the big companies it&#x27;s going to be a lot less.<p>The other bad news is that there&#x27;s not much opportunity for growth or change. A lot of that is in your own hands but there are only so many things the company needs. If you have an ambition to learn haskell this isn&#x27;t a good position for you. Similarly, there&#x27;s no other dev. position to move into, you can&#x27;t switch to another team working on different projects with different technology, you won&#x27;t have the opportunity to become a lead or a manager, etc. The job can be what you make of it, but there&#x27;s only so far it can realistically stretch, so you should consider that in terms of your long-term career goals. Of course, if you want to spend your free time working on some open source project, there&#x27;s nothing stopping you.<p>Overall I&#x27;d reiterate that cultural fit is by far the most important part of this job. If you&#x27;re excited about the possibility of working at PA then that&#x27;s square one, if not then you should just ignore this job posting entirely. Beyond that, if you&#x27;re competent and proficient at web dev and comfortable with getting your hands dirty with networking or hardware on rare occasions, and if you&#x27;re the sort of person who wants to settle into a role where most of the time you&#x27;ll be setting up content-heavy sites then this might be a good opportunity for you. It&#x27;s certainly not a job for everyone, or even the vast majority of devs.",1385522130

It is the only &quot;gold-colored&quot; metal.<p>* Gold is used in electronic components: connectors, switch and relay contacts, soldered joints, connecting wires and connection strips.<p>* Gold alloys are used for fillings, crowns, bridges and orthodontic appliances.<p>* Gold is used as a drug to treat a small number of medical conditions.<p>* Small amounts of gold are used to remedy a condition known as Lagophthalmos, which is an inability of a person to close their eyes completely.<p>* Radioactive gold is used in diagnosis.

A year ago I was working on my own stupid startup, ran out of money, ran out of credit, wasn&#x27;t sure there would be another blue sky in my life.  Everyone has ups and downs, its the hardest thing to go through.<p>However, life is not over.  It may feel like it, and you may even want it to be. But YOU are still writing YOUR story -- do you want to be the guy who fell and didn&#x27;t get back up?  Fuck no.  You want to be the guy who had nothing left and no matter how far down the rabbit hole you go, you find a way back out.  You want to be a success.  You want it all.  You&#x27;ll have it all someday. Is that day today? No.  But because you&#x27;re still alive you have the chance to make it a reality.<p>So get back up, find work, pay off bills, and you&#x27;ll be back in the game before you know it.  You&#x27;re intelligent, smart, driven.  Remember -- do not let failure dictate who you are.  You&#x27;re not a failure, failure is simply something that happens to all of us. Learn from failure and let it compliment your decision making in the future.  You&#x27;ll be wiser and you&#x27;ll learn from this mistake.<p>Good luck and I&#x27;ll see you around,\nTiger",1385521229

3454103,comment,3453663,3454021,4,0,pudquick,,,"For anyone reading this and not knowing about the service / how to make changes, Comcast did set up a nice simple site for it:<p><a href=""http://dns-opt-out.comcast.net/help-index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dns-opt-out.comcast.net/help-index.php</a><p>The only requirement that you need is your Comcast account information that was created when you signed up with them. If you don't know the username, to avoid the issues whichdan ran into just call them on the phone (or if you're on your home internet connection you can start a webchat with them at <a href=""https://www.comcastsupport.com/ChatEntry/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.comcastsupport.com/ChatEntry/</a>  and tell them you forgot the account, then once you know it, ask if they can reset the password for you).<p>This will reprovision your cable modem(s) with alternate DNS settings (which are actually the same DNS server settings as their DNSSEC servers: 75.75.75.75 and 75.75.76.76). If you don't want to mess with turning it on/off and you've got a router connected to the cable modem (or a computer directly connected - please never do this!), you can just manually change your DNS server settings to these values and get the same effect (effectively ignoring the ones provided through the cable modem connection).<p>It <i>should</i> trigger a reboot/update on your cable modem, which will then cause it to pull down the alternate DNS server settings. Per the documentation on their help page, you may need to reboot any attached routers so that they pull down updated DNS information (though loss of link with the cable modem should trigger that when the cable modem comes back up).<p>And though the parent commenter used Google DNS (which I really do like) - users that make use of the iOS App Store for their iPhones / iPods / iPads may want to consider using the Comcast DNS server settings - if not for all devices in their house, then at least manually enter them for WiFi networks served by Comcast cable modems.<p>In my personal experience, using the 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 Google DNS server settings resulted in rather slow downloads compared to using the Comcast DNS server settings, as I believe Apple's App Store CDN server addresses were resolving to geographically incorrect / distant servers.<p>CDNs can use DNS trickery to speed up delivery. When a domain server (your ISP's) looks up the IP address for a server name that's hosting content you want, the name server can return tailored IP addresses based on where in the world it thinks the request is coming from.<p>Google's DNS servers do their own trickery to attempt to connect you to a DNS server close to where you're at (or at least provide results quickly for where you're at), but Comcast's DNS servers are hosted on their core networks which can reach their customer base quickly. A CDN IP address result tailored for where the Comcast DNS servers are hosted will result in an IP address that your home connection will likely be able to pull down from very quickly as well.<p>Results may vary, and I do trust Google to do less evil with their DNS results than Comcast - but damn it, I wasn't willing to wait 20 minutes to download an app that should have taken only 2.",1326322744

With that kind of runway you can develop several product therefore greatly increasing your chances of successes. I don't know what the demands are in your industry but development is not all glamorous, HN paints a rosy picture but that is because it is a certain segment of the industry. Just taking a job in the industry could place you in a job that is every bit as bad as your current one. There is a lot of ignorance of what developers do and a lot of that ignorance is willful. It can be a trial to put up with it at times. It is the reason you see a lot of freelancers on HN trying to make the transition to a product based company. If I had 2-3 years I personally would develop a product. There are plenty of good ideas floating around, pick one you like and start building it.<p>As for the whiteboard don't worry about them, I lock up on them too. There are good companies out there that know they filter out good candidates, so a lot of people are starting to look at what you have built, not biased trick questions on a while board. If you come across one, politely decline noting that it will not accurately reflect your capabilities and let them know if it is a necessity then they can conclude the interview and that you will not take offense. Interviews are a two way street, I get an uneasy feeling from organizations that rely on the whiteboard and feel that they build one dimensional development teams, as such I try to avoid them, and generally try to bring the interview to a close as quick as possible when I see that they rely on them.",1326322448

Furthermore, I too am advocating for constructive change, just of a different sort.  By adherence to what I see as the spirit of your request (discussing constructive action) I hope I may justify a lack of adherence to to the letter of your request.<p>What kind of constructive action am I advocating?  Nothing less than to continue the argument, in the most charitable and reasonable spirit we can attain.  We are arguing about the most important of things: our moral aim.  That is, ""what is it we ought to do?""  Should we promote diversity in computing?  Tied up with this question of aims is the question of facts, namely: ""Does promoting the politically correct notion of diversity mean the same as promoting the kind of diversity which will make computing as a profession more capable at achieving its ends?""  Certainly, if there is a kind of diversity that brings the profession of computing closer to its ends (whatever those may be, and that too is in question) then I imagine that promoting such diversity is considered wise by all here.<p>What is primarily in debate is whether or not politically correct diversity (diversity of gender and race, primarily) is the same as effective diversity.  If, like you seem to think, both kinds of diversity are the same, then doing what you suggest is in fact constructive.  However, if politically correct diversity is orthogonal or (Ada Lovelace forbid) contrary to effective diversity, then your actions will be at best ineffective and at worst destructive. The whole point of this argument is that we want our profession to do what is constructive, and recognize that we need to sort out as a profession what in fact is constructive.<p>Hacker News is a great place to have this kind of discussion since a) you have willing and able participants, and b) the clear tree structure of posts helps considerably since well-formed arguments all tend to take such a structure.  There are other sites for discussing what ""can/should be done (or what you are already doing)"" for a particular agenda.<p>The attitude you give off in your post is one of ""deeds, not words"", which in my experience is equivalent to an attitude of ""words, not thoughts"". You are dealing with a crowd which is perhaps best known acting upon those beliefs of which they have been rationally convinced. Do you not agree that it is better for people to hold and act upon beliefs of which they have been convinced by means of reason?  If so, why then do you speak so glibly of ""tak[ing] apart the logic, rhetoric, and nitpick[ing] every word"" which is nothing less then the process of analytic reasoning? If not, why are you here?<p>P.S. Note that I have not actually taken a stance on the issue in question in this post.",1326321242

3453982,comment,3452908,3453602,2,0,yangez,,,"I appreciate your in-depth analysis, looks pretty accurate to me. I think the tone of my original post falsely suggested that I thought no one should give their photos away for free. This isn't true - I firmly believe that if people stopped complaining about factors outside their control (like other photographers giving away photos) and instead spent the time honing their craft, maybe there wouldn't be so much to complain about. However, I do understand where photographers are coming from.<p>> On a per transaction basis the market value of a photograph may be lower, but those lower prices cause more people to buy photographs, thus increasing the total economic value.<p>The problem here is that the market for these photos is fairly inelastic. The people who are taking photos aren't the ones buying them. At the lowest end of the spectrum, free photos don't generate any increase in demand. For instance, the fact that a magazine can get a photo for free doesn't mean that they're going to want to buy more stock photos. It's just going to make them want more photos for free.<p>Consider how a web developer would feel if there was suddenly a huge influx of high-quality web developers who would develop entire projects for free. Obviously this is economically infeasible in this industry, but that's basically why photographers are mad when it happens to them.",1326320607

You went with them because the free/amateur photography was just not good enough. But you didn't <i>really</i> need 9/10 quality; maybe 6/10 would be perfectly adequate for your needs. Now, you can buy low-cost or sometimes even free 6/10 photography. This causes lost work for the 10/10-quality photographers, but it's work that in some sense never <i>really</i> valued their product fully in the first place, but previously bought it because there was no ""good enough"" lower-quality/cost alternative. Now they only get the work of people who <i>really</i>, absolutely want 10/10 quality work and are willing to pay for it, which is a much smaller market.",1326319490

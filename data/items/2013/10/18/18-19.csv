US GDP last year was about $15.7 trillion.<p>Bank of America has about $2 trillion in assets. If the amount of money you give to a bank is more than half its current assets, then your relationship to the bank is fundamentally different than anyone else. You&#x27;re not a <i>customer</i>. You&#x27;re an <i>owner.</i> That&#x27;s the scale of money that we&#x27;re talking here.

Sometimes it is evident just from the original title itself, without looking at the content of the article, that the submitter&#x27;s title was better. For example, when John Graham-Cumming shut down his blog, the submitter took the title of jgc&#x27;s blog entry, which was something generic like &quot;Shutting down my blog&quot;, and simply added who it was, so it because something lie &quot;John Graham-Cumming: Shutting down my blog&quot;.<p>It would be nice if the mods could at least let that kind of submitted title survive.",1382122514

6573258,comment,6572466,6573157,1,0,cbhl,,,"Right, but the guidelines are developed from people doing undesirable things to the detriment of HN. (Presumably, submitting blog spam and the front page being full of ten blog spam pages that have the same title and all point back to a single source.) If (as the critics suggest) the combination of &quot;submit original source&quot; and &quot;use original title&quot; are making HN worse, we can adjust our behaviour and change the guidelines.<p>What I&#x27;m advocating is that people submit &quot;blog spam&quot; only when:<p>1. The submitter is <i>absolutely certain</i> that the original source has a title that makes no sense out of context,<p>2. The submitter wants to editorialize the title because of (1), and,<p>3. The submitter owns the blog that has the &quot;blog spam&quot; post (i.e. they don&#x27;t submit blog spam from TechCrunch or Kotaku or what-have-you unless they actually write for TC/Kotaku/etc.)<p>If a &quot;blog spam&quot; post makes it to the front page way more often than the original source because of editorialized titles, then that is the decision of the collective HN community. I suspect that it rarely will.<p>As a bonus, if the new approach works well, maybe we can switch to an automated title-scraper.<p>I agree that there may be a short-term increase in blogspam, but this approach lets the people who are upset about title-changing see for themselves which title was most useful to HN readers. I hypothesize that in the long run, people who write factually incorrect editorialized titles will learn the hard way (because their &quot;blog spam&quot; doesn&#x27;t get upvoted) and eventually go back to submitting original sources (and maybe they&#x27;ll stop complaining about title reverts to boot).<p>And, in either case, this removes the need for mods to revert titles, which (hopefully) is win-win.",1382122340

The map and filter functions are examples of this.<p>Usually you pass references, because that&#x27;s the most generic option. I wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;you can&#x27;t write generic functions&quot;, but you sometimes have to add wrappers that convert between levels of indirection.<p>> My hello world for evaluating a language is this: write a program that sums its arguments. It&#x27;s arguments might be numbers or strings so you have to filter and cast. It&#x27;s a simple program but I find it a good indicator of how elegant (in terms of what I consider elegant of course) a language is to use on a daily basis. Lisps obviously do best in this type of test but Haskell also does very well despite it&#x27;s type system. So the issue isn&#x27;t types, it&#x27;s pointers.<p>Certainly a language can be easier to use and you can write more elegant-looking code if most everything is a reference. No argument there.<p>It basically sounds like you weren&#x27;t using the low-level features of Rust, which are important for our use cases but not important for everyone&#x27;s. So Rust might well not be for you. That&#x27;s totally fine, as I don&#x27;t intend for Rust to be the one language to rule them all.",1382121934

Normally you would need like, 4 tables to store this and carefully planned queries to work with them efficiently. However, if the object graph has no external references (besides the top-level object) you can just safely shove the whole thing into a JSON without losing referential integrity.<p>Your reasons are very valid however so obviously you have to  think about the consequences before using non-standard features. However, not using advanced or novel features (which non-standard features tend to be) can also lead to stagnation and loss of competitiveness so you have to also be careful with being careful, if that makes sense.",1382121007

6573115,comment,6565011,6566740,1,0,jarrett,,,"> people need to stop reciting this compulsively and take the time to think each situation through.<p>I believe that thinking has already been done, and the reasoning published. If you can refute the well-publicized arguments against JS crypto, then of course that would be productive and appreciated. Given the discussions that have already taken place, I believe the burden of proof now rests with those who support JS crypto, not those who oppose it.<p>To make an analogy: We &quot;compulsively&quot; assert that the earth orbits the sun. But that&#x27;s not a cargo cult. It&#x27;s a conclusion which we&#x27;ve confidently accepted based on the weight of the evidence.<p>> Realize that the SecureDrop document submission client is a web application. The browser of the document submitter will run whatever the SecureDrop Source Server provides it barring the edge case of the submitter verifying the source page source with GitHub before allowing JS in NoScript.<p>If that&#x27;s true, then SecureDrop might not be so secure. I&#x27;m not pointing to SecureDrop as a gold standard. There are very few cryptosystems I trust.<p>> The security of the document submitter is already prone to compromise by way of a malicious web app provided by malicious Source Server or MITM. Moving the project to something more JS heavy on the client side would in no way worsen the threat model.<p>That might be true, but then again it might not. We don&#x27;t know much about JS crypto. We don&#x27;t know what attacks are possible. (We know about compromising the JS source, but that&#x27;s only one threat model. There could be others that are unstudied.) Thus, it&#x27;s quite possible that there are attacks which depend on the application using a specific browser feature, such as drag-and-drop. Is this likely? Not terribly so. But is it possible? Absolutely.<p>But I&#x27;m sort of nitpicking. Like you said, JS can be MITMed, so there&#x27;s not much point in debating whether a given JS crypto app is secure or not. The best strategy is to just not use JS crypto.",1382120960

6573051,comment,6571078,6571078,1,0,DougWebb,,,"I know a thing or two about economics, but I am far, far, far from calling myself an expert or even reasonably knowledgeable. With that prelude, can someone explain this:<p>If China is getting lots of dollars from selling goods to the US, and then buying lots of US Bonds to keep those dollars out of the Chinese economy, presumably the bonds are just being held somewhere. They represent a promise from the US to China that says &quot;Those goods you sold us? We haven&#x27;t really paid for them yet, but at some point in the future we will, with a bit of interest.&quot;<p>So at this point the goods have changed hands, the Chinese workers have been paid in Yuan, and the Chinese government is holding the excess USD value of those goods in a big pile of paper.<p>What happens if the US says to China &quot;You know what? We&#x27;re not going to be paying you for those goods afterall. Sorry about that.&quot;<p>Obviously, this will piss off China, but let&#x27;s ignore the political ramifications. What are the economic consequences? The pile of paper is now worthless, so the net worth of the Chinese government drops. Does that matter? The dollars aren&#x27;t part of the Chinese economy, so there shouldn&#x27;t be an impact there. Is the Chinese government using their US Bond portfolio as an asset to back borrowing from other countries? Is it counting on the interest to fund future spending? (Risky gamble if they are.)<p>Going forward, the Chinese probably won&#x27;t be so willing to buy more US Bonds, which would be understandable, and other countries and individuals might be wary as well. But maybe not, if it&#x27;s framed as a one-time reset of our debt (kind of like a bankruptcy) and there&#x27;s some changes to the way our debt is managed to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get out of control again. (Maybe an amendment to hold all living US politicians, past and present, personally accountable for a proportion of the US debt weighted by the height and duration of their office.)<p>So, maybe we could still sell bonds, and maybe not. If the Chinese stop buying, they&#x27;re going to have to come up with another way to keep USD out of their economy if they want to continue selling goods to the US. That makes me think they&#x27;ll keep buying the bonds, especially if there&#x27;s no material impact from writing off the value of the existing bonds. Or maybe they&#x27;ll buy other things from us. They want a navy, and we&#x27;ve got a bunch of ships mothballed in various states of disrepair and a need to earn revenue without selling bonds, so maybe a deal can be struck there. It&#x27;s got to be cheaper to cleanup and retrofit an old ship than building a new one from scratch, even if it&#x27;s less impressive. They can use the old ones for support ships or something.<p>Here in the US, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d be likely to see fewer Chinese goods coming in or their prices raised, because both of those would be detrimental to the Chinese. We&#x27;d definitely have to get government spending under control because we couldn&#x27;t sell so many bonds (if any), but we need to do that anyway. Zeroing out a big chunk of the existing debt will eliminate a lot of interest payments, which would help a lot.<p>So, does the reluctance to do this all come down to the reputation of the US Government and the US People&#x27;s ability to pay back the debt we&#x27;ve accumulated?",1382120427

This is Germany&#x27;s issue too: they lend people money, so that others can buy their goods.  My sense is that the Chinese aren&#x27;t propping the currency up as much as they used to, but that&#x27;s not based on hard data.<p>On 2 - In general countries (though not necessarily specific individuals and companies) do better with cheaper goods.  This is why the gains of trade almost always exceed the costs.  The question is does a forced cheapening by China create inefficiencies by moving us to tasks that we don&#x27;t have competitive advantage?

Granted, people will sometimes editorialize (injecting their opinion into titles) or put outright incorrect information in titles, but we already have a good flagging mechanism to deal with this, not to mention people&#x27;s ability to comment on title abuse.<p>The problem is that a lot of worthy articles are given shitty titles by publishers - the title of an article is very often <i>not</i> what an author intended, but what an editor decided would draw more eyeballs. This is particularly a problem for science articles, where the article deals with some interesting but typically slightly obscure discovery, but the title is pure linkbait. For example, some weeks back I submitted a post about the rather surprising discovery of polypropolene on one of Saturn&#x27;s moons by a NASA probe; the title on the article was &#x27;common household plastic found in space&#x27; which makes it sound like someone had accidentally dumped a bunch of spoons out of the ISS (and which led to the top comment being a moan about the crappy title, calling me out for <i>not</i> changing it - in fact I had, but the mods had reverted it). The web is awash in linkbaity titles, and they tend to be either misleading or to obscure the aspect of the news that&#x27;s &#x27;of interest to hackers.&#x27;<p>I think the policy should be to trust members. If some HN users persistently editorialize or supply misleading titles, then they&#x27;ll be flagged and lose credibility or get banned, dependent on how deliberate and egregious their title abuse. Members who submit informative titles will correspondingly be promoted. The karma/user identity system functions perfectly adequately in this respect.

For comparison, that&#x27;s more requests than Googlebot did. Just flat-out banning everything frustrates people, and encourages them to just ignore robots.txt entirely.<p>If you&#x27;re being hammered by a bot, contact the bot&#x27;s owner! Most bots have a link in the user agent that you can follow. Barring that, ban the specific bot.

In other words, standardized testing is not always at odds with critical thinking.<p>For example, South Korea, a nation with a very strong emphasis on standardized testing, consistently ranks in the world&#x27;s top 5 universities, according to Pearson. Its students have strong reading and math skills, which prepare them to meet the challenges of many jobs.<p>We should question the myth that standardized testing always harms critical thinking.

If it&#x27;s a cultural problem with the perception of STEM, we can work to change the perception of STEM.<p>1. If it&#x27;s us, then honest self-examination can reveal what we&#x27;re doing wrong. Are we patronizing towards the women we work with or who are in the ranks below us (grade-wise in school, hierarchically in the workplace) more than we are with the men? Are they more sensitive to it, if so can we change how we approach them to be less off-putting?<p>2. If it&#x27;s the wider culture in the US, we can participate in programs that reveal the reality of STEM to a broader audience. Help with youth mentorship programs. Become a teacher. There are many good math and science teachers, but there are many terrible ones too. I like my friends, but some of them teach math because that&#x27;s what they were qualified to teach by credit hours, not because of an innate interest or understanding. They don&#x27;t convey the sense of interest and itrigue that can capture children&#x27;s attention and interest.<p>3. The reality is some combination of the above, our institutions (educational and professional) contain a great deal of systemic, often unintended, bias. Our media portrays engineers as lonely losers or creeps. As a community we can work to tackle these things if we take it on as a real challenge, instead of dismissing it as just gender differences.",1382119642

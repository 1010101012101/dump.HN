Its example language is a typed lambda calculus. This is both good and bad. The good: you can evaluate most expressions in your head or with a pencil. The bad: sometimes it is difficult to read without evaluating the expressions.<p>It is heavy on proofs and mathematics, but it does what it says: it introduces you to the basics of type theory as applied to programming languages.<p>Edit: an amazon reviewer pointed at <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Object-Oriented-Languages-Types-Semantics/dp/026202523X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Object-Oriented-Languages-...</a> as an alternative book.

Then, you'd get it back with every possible bug marked in your program, and he very rarely missed any[2].<p>That was the first time in college I thought ""I really need to learn how to do that!""<p>I went to a state school, so maybe all you guys with your degrees from fancy schools wouldn't be that impressed, but the difference between this professor and the rest there was gigantic. (He retired that year in a round of state-wide budget cuts, so that's the last class I had him.)<p>[1] A lot of the other teachers wanted you to hand in binaries so they can see it run.

I had an idea that I was going to try for myself but turns out I don't have the capital necessary to do so, so you're welcome to it if you like;<p>Create a superfluid buying agent consisting of two components, a basic exchange service like MtGox that cashes btc to a fiat currency on the backend, and frontend merchant widgets that update a given fiat currency price displayed in BTC to the actual user. This would give your users the ability to shop on any traditional internet shopping site and pay with btc transparently, you would assumedly implement the dynamic pricing in btc using a browser plugin of some description.<p>Further automate your trades so if the market is rising you hold btc, if it's falling you instantly liquidate to fiat for your received btc. It turns out to be basically a transparent way to accrue more btc in an upwards moving market and act as a fee charging instant electronic funds transfer provider in a downwards moving market.

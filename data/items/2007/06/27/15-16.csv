Ruby on Rails makes you more productive, end of story. (Edited to remove unnecessary flame. Sorry about that, it's been a long week.)",1182959826

Its advantages compared to YC:<p><i>1) it is a collective rather than an individual initiative by members of the VC community, serial entrepreneurs, mentors, and angel investors and 2) it incorporates the challenges specific to European entrepreneurs in starting up businesses.</i><p>Number 1 is not an advantage.  We're entrepreneurs, mentors, and angel investors.  The only thing we're not is VCs. But including VCs in a seed funding operation is a bad idea. It means any startup that doesn't get a follow-on funding offer from those VCs will be marked as a loser to all other VCs. Techstars has the same problem.<p>I'm not sure what number 2 means exactly, but it is unfortunately worded.  ""Incorporating challenges"" sounds like they mean it will be more difficult for a startup to succeed in London than in the US.  That's probably not what they mean, but it's probably true.",1182958195

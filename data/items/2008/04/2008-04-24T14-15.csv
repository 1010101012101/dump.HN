172496,story,,,3,1,fiaz,"Ask HN :: Android + GAE + ""C-Block"" -- Has Google already won the ""mobile phone wars""?",,"(please refrain from any Star Wars ""Clone Wars"" references with what follows...)<p>No doubt we are familiar with the ""OS/Desktop Wars"" that prevailed during the 80s.  And of course there was the ""Browser Wars"" of the 90s.  The 00s saw the ""Search Wars"" and it's clear who won here.<p>I'm betting that Google has already set the stage for the ""Mobile Wars"", and it's arguable that it might have already been preemptively won.  If you combine Android, GAE, and the recent spectrum bidding Google has been involved with, it seems to me that Google has brilliantly staged the ultimate coup - well ahead of any battle taking place.  Now anybody can combine the ease of use of creating an application on Android, along with the ability to (theoretically) scale gracefully through GAE , and then have the application widely accessible through the C-Block.<p>Any thoughts?<p>EDIT: changed the terse geeky headline to something more digestible...",1209048657

I know, because they disagreed with me.""<p>I remember that blog post. Instead of responding to the comments in his blog post (a la PG), he removed comments from his blog and started calling the posters names.  The people posting on the site were trying to point out that his arguments were specious, and not very well thought out.<p>Several people argued with him on Reddit, including Avi Bryant (creator of Seaside), Slava Pestov (creator of the Factor programming language).

172474,comment,172450,172450,0,0,ssharp,,,"This article is a little ridiculous.  Although I'm not a Twitter user, so maybe I don't fully understand the dynamics of using it as a search agent.  From what I do know about it, I know I wouldn't want to use it.<p>1.  Twitter has nowhere close to the amount of users that Google has and never will.<p>2.  There is no measure of quality for the types of results you're going to get back.  One man's treasure is another mans trash and I don't want to get a bunch of garbage thrown at me.<p>3.  Google is always there and I can search it to my hearts content.  If I start bugging my entire Twitter network with requests, I'll lose my network quickly.<p>4.  I'm not sure how this creates any productivity.  If you have friends willing to do your searches for you, they're losing productivity and it's not even zero sum, it's a multiple of how many responses you get and you yourself aren't really gaining all that much in probability.<p>5.  Your trusted network can go down at any time.  What happens when people aren't around or somebody you once trusted Goatse's you?  You'll be crawling back to Google in no time.",1209046986
172473,comment,171818,171818,0,0,tstegart,,,"Coming from a non-techie perspective, the reason I'm not using it is because its all way too confusing. I mean, have you read an article about this stuff? Everyone defines it in different ways, hardly anyone can explain with specificity what exactly it will do for you, and its very hard for anyone to found out information about what to do when or where. By that I mean, no one has told me what I can do as a non-programmer. Business people won't start using it until there is a specific advantage to doing it, but no one can point that out yet. Furthermore, I haven't been able to find a way to figure this out without hiring someone.
For example, I have a TypePad blog. So someone explain what I'm supposed to do, how it will help me, and how I will do it. In a way that doesn't involve coding. I dare you.",1209046878

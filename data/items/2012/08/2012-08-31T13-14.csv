4459707,comment,4457854,4458548,5,0,pcwalton,,,"Yes, the docs are awful at the moment. It's mostly a question of making sure things are stable before we commit to writing a lot of docs; we absolutely need better ones. The standard library tends to use the bleeding-edge features more than user Rust code (as it contains implementations of core traits and whatnot), so its churn is high. Despite what others have suggested, I don't think it needs a total rewrite, but various names should change.<p>A ""go""-like binary is on the roadmap; it's mostly a question of refactoring. We have a pretty printer, a doc generator, a package manager, and a compiler (all in various stages of completeness); the trick is to just bundle them into one nice package.<p>A trail of notes would definitely be helpful, to see what the initial hurdles are for beginners.<p>From what I've seen the biggest problem is that 0.3's syntax is totally different from the unreleased 0.4 (due to be released next week). Most people, understandably, build from the packaged 0.3 and none of the examples in the documentation work. 0.4 contains the syntax we're committing to; most of the changes from then on should be backwards-compatible with it (unless you use the deprecated stuff, which we're adding warnings for).",1346421571

4459681,comment,4459048,4459048,3,0,tokenadult,,,"Here's the key sentence in the article: ""'We're looking at a very interesting population scenario'one that does not jibe entirely with what we thought we knew about how waves modern human populations migrated into and through Asia and out to Oceania's islands.""<p>Svante Pbo was the pioneer of doing DNA sequencing on samples of old human tissues (he started with Egyptian mummies when he was an Egyptologist). I heard a lecture by Pbo at the 2008 Nobel Conference<p><a href=""https://gustavus.edu/events/nobelconference/2008/presenters.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gustavus.edu/events/nobelconference/2008/presenters....</a><p>and heard there from some of the other researchers who use DNA analysis to trace human origins.<p>One of the problems in the discipline so far, as you can well figure out for yourself by thinking about it, is that the sample sizes for defining what genome pattern is ""modern human"" are still remarkably small, especially when we get to full genome sequences of individuals with well determined geographic origin, and smaller still for Neanderthal sequences and smallest of all for Denisovan sequences. So much work still needs to be done to figure out what the usual range of free variation of genes that are not under strong selection pressure is in the hominin genome line.<p>Figuring out what genes actually do at the individual level in a genome as complicated as the human genome has turned out to be much harder than was first supposed (as mentioned in the submitted article), so while tracing lineages with gene markers that are not under strong selection pressure helps define geographical population groups with common founder populations, knowing even an individual's complete genome does little to show the traits of the individual. (The first human genome sequenced didn't even reveal that the sequenced individual has blue eyes, for example.)<p>Turkheimer, E. (2012).

Whatever would we as psychologists do with such information?""<p>AFTER EDIT: The interesting question raised by the top-level comment that was posted before this comment has received some good replies. The question, and the issue of defining a ""species,"" reminds me of what Richard Dawkins points out about common descent. If you lined up in a line by order of descent with ALL of your ancestors, including the ancestors no longer living, as you looked at each individual in the line you could say ""He is the son of the father standing next to him,"" going back as far as you want, even hundreds of millions of years, and yet at some point in the deep past the ancestors would not look anything at all like ""humans,"" or indeed even like mammals or like tetrapods. At the individual level, OF COURSE you are part of the same species as your parents (by definition of ""species""). Life on Earth today has a common ancestor, or at the very least a common set of one-celled ancestors, by general agreement of biologists, so all the species that have differentiated from one another over time can be traced to common ancestors of multiple species. You are undoubtedly related to your parents, who belong to the same species you do, but you have remote ancestors whom no one would call individuals of the species Homo sapiens. There simply isn't any definite line to draw between one species and the next, historically, and that was what was shocking about Darwin's idea of branching speciation from common ancestors, the only idea he presented visually in his book The Origin of Species.<p>For a book-length treatment of speciation as a scientific issue for the thoroughly curious, see Speciation by Jerry A. Coyne and H. Allen Orr,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Speciation-Jerry-A-Coyne/dp/0878930892"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Speciation-Jerry-A-Coyne/dp/0878930892</a><p>which discusses mechanisms of speciation and how theories about those mechanisms are tested by biologists.<p>ONE MORE EDIT: The questioner in the other top-level comment is coming back with follow-up questions, which is good. The simple answer to the basic question is that biologists properly do NOT define a ""species"" by looking at DNA sequences, but by looking at reproductive behavior. For individuals who are dead and long gone, out inferences about reproductive behavior, and thus species definitions, are weak, and we shouldn't rely on a single DNA sequence to say a sample of old bones belongs to a different ""species"" from another sample of old bones until we gather other forms of evidence about the possibility of the individuals mating and having offspring with each other.",1346421196

I thought we had plenty of languages for that.</i><p>We have plenty of languages, but most of them are low performance interpreted languages, have major compromises or are not architecturally sound. Go addresses a lot of those issues - more than any other language so far.<p><i>You seem to ignore performance altogether, if you programmed in C/C++ for twenty years but don't care for performance and don't do low-level work, why have you been using C/C++?</i><p>I don't ignore performance. There are many ways to achieve performance. I've worked on embedded systems (military, medical sector) and occasionally need direct hardware access which is where I use C/C++ and that is primarily to manipulate a device and hand off a suitable abstraction to a higher level language (with a garbage collector).<p><i>When you have to tune and debug your application to please the garbage collector having to deal with your own memory seems like child's play. It is much easier and safer to verify that your own memory management won't bite you than it is to be sure that your garbage collector won't eat you. (surely that depends on the context etc. but making broad claims seems to be on topic...)</i><p>That is all down to determinism. Determinism can be achieved in various simple ways. If you understand the language, you can write code that pre-allocates and reuses memory in critical sections therefore invoking no garbage collection penalty. Isolating critical sections from each other is still a problem in C/C++ if you consider the threading model that they use.<p><i>Right tool for the right job. C/C++ has ""monopoly"" on a lot of use cases (way more than any other language) and considering its issues I truly believe that a ""better C/C++"" is needed, way more than those 20 JVM-based languages that popup every other month. Or Go.</i><p>I'm not a fan of all ""those 20 JVM-based languages"" - I find them tedious and ugly. I'm the most critical person on the planet when it comes to this sort of thing. Go pretty much hits the mark.<p>I think your complaints could be addressed with a simple extension to pause the collector therefore introducing determinism i.e:<p><pre><code>   func CriticalFunc() {
       defer runtime.ResumeGC()
       runtime.PauseGC()
       // critical section
   }</code></pre>",1346420881

If so, tell them.<p>Consider your filter tweets section from an adoption standpoint:<p>Create filters to automatically move Tweets to folders, and reduce Twitter noise. Tweets can be filtered based on hashtags, URLs, Tweet content and author - or any combination of these.<p>1. I wouldn't recommend using the name 'folders'. Tweets aren't synonymous with letters (that go into folders), tweets are more like sticky notes. I'd suggest you think of a new name to call the tweet containers.<p>2. You first talk about moving tweets into folders and then about filtering them. (I think you are implying that you filter tweets into these 'folders'). You should use easier to understand terms such as 'Sort tweets from those who you are following into ...'. Use comparisons to simplify the explanation.<p>3. Provide sensible defaults or provide a sensible way to get users started. (ex. type in the twitter handle/username from your favourite tweeter). A demo is a good idea, but there should definitely also be an easy way to get started.<p>4. Market yourself effectively. From what I see on your website, it seems like the website is a twitter client - but I'm not sure. If it is a client, then say so. (You have to tell people what you want them to use your service for).<p>Some of the above recommendations simply require rewriting your copy (text on website). I have also suggested some options that will require hiring a developer. I reckon the best measure to use here is: if your mother uses twitter, will you be able to sit her down and will she be a 'self-starter' using your website or will you have to hold her hand? Try it.

At least C++11 gives you options: <map> is generally an RB Tree, <unordered_map> is generally a hash table.<p><i>Trees have O(n log(n)) element lookup time as opposed to O(1) for hashtable</i><p>According to [1], <map> (And <set> and <multimap> and <multiset>) lookups have O(log n) complexity, while <unordered_map> lookups have O(1) amortized and O(n) worst-case complexity.<p>Again, lots of trade-offs to consider, which is why the C++11 stdlib, IMHO, does a great job, whereas other popular languages which provide ""one true data structure"" of each type are really not that great without third party libraries, as they don't give you the option to choose the right data structure for the job. Eg, in python, if you need a dict, you use a dict without thinking about if its implemented as a tree or a hash table or a heap or a... similarly, if you need a list, you use a list without worrying if its a linked list, a skip list, a dynamic array, something else entirely. Usually this is a good thing - you can just get on with your life, but sometimes you really do want to make sure that operation X will be O(1) or O(log n) or whatever, and if the built-in data structure does not guarantee this, you must use third party libraries. At least in C++11, the stdlib gives you some options (and usually makes it clear what the complexity of operations are). I really like that about C++11.<p>For a lot of languages, ""the right data structure for the right job"" means a choice between lists, vectors, dictionaries (however they are implemented), sets etc. In reality, that's only the first tier - once you decide that lists are the right tool, you still need to decide <i>what kind of list</i>, and a lot of languages don't give you that choice by default.

</code></pre>
Stripe's current success allows them to be very selective about who they hire, which allows them to be fussy about all of the qualities that <i>they</i> think makes a great employee.<p>There are a number of factors that could ""flip"" the company's hiring from very selective to less selective. For example:<p><pre><code>  * Parts of their culture might not scale indefinitely.
  * They might start running short of cash, and have to
    settle for less expensive hires, or cut some of the
    office luxuries.
  * They might have to start hiring so fast that they can't
    be as selective about their hires.
  * Their tech stack will grow old, and unappealing to 
    energetic self-starters who want to work with the hot
    new thing.
  * Their current employees will get older, start families,
    and have other equally (if not more) important things
    than work.
</code></pre>
Clearly, Stripe cares about their culture, and I'm sure that they'll do everything they can keep their workplace experience great, however, cultures are as much an art as they are a science, and what works well for a small group doesn't necessarily work for a large one.<p>(edit: formatting)",1346418325

A few command line params, if that, and I&#x27;ve got a local nsqd running that I can develop and test against. Great for those offline coding sessions on BART.<p>The tools it ships with are very handy, specifically to_nsq and nsq_tail. Again, both make developing stuff really easy because I can get stuff in and out with fast, native command line tools or http. In fact, when I was first playing around I built an entire prototype based on a few simple shell scripts and the provided tools, just to see what would happen.<p>The nsqadmin and nsq_stat tools give you a lot of visibility into what your producers and consumers are doing, how well things are performing, who is connected to what, etc. And again, part of the distribution and very easy to run locally.<p>The Go producer and consumer API is clean and easy to build around, pretty well documented with a lot of examples in the NSQ apps themselves.<p>So far very stable. I haven&#x27;t seen any crashes on the server or producer/consumer side.<p>Helpful and friendly people on a low noise freenode channel.",1422316578

The note that messages may be delivered more than once is a warning to developers who might expect exactly-once semantics.<p>However, it <i>is</i> a benefit in that allowing for more-than-once-delivery affords better performance. Think of it from an algorithmic perspective: if you want to send a message exactly once, you have to wait around for acknowledgement that your message was accepted.<p>If you instead don&#x27;t mind sending duplicates, you can fire off the first copy, wait for an ack for a while, and then fire off again to another node (in case, perhaps, there was a network partition). If it turns out that both copies arrive at their final destination intact, your application now has to deal with duplicates. But, that&#x27;s faster than the alternative.<p>So it puts more burden on the developer to deduplicate where necessary (or program in a model where duplicates don&#x27;t matter anyway, such as with CRDTS), in exchange for greater throughput.",1422316338

It took almost a day of thrashing to fix the failures, none of which could be seen in a real browser.  Super irritating.<p>I&#x27;ve also had to work around weird JS issues that only affect Phantom, and corrupted screenshots making it rather hard to see what&#x27;s going wrong.  For our team&#x27;s time-spent vs time-saved, Phantom has been a waste.  Our app is very JS-heavy, but that&#x27;s why I thought Phantom would be a good idea.<p>I think the most important kind of test is the kind that developers will actually use.  If tests are hard to understand, hard to run, unreliable, or slow, then they won&#x27;t get used (Selenium!).<p>I just want idiomatic, quick, easy-to-write tests so regressions in our app are much less likely to happen.  Angular&#x27;s approach met those requirements pretty well and that was a big influence to our choice to use it (two years ago, data point of one).  It looks like React has a good approach to testing too.<p>If the Aurelia docs suggest using Jasmine to test the application, especially if they help setting up html fixtures and data, then that&#x27;s encouraging.  But I don&#x27;t think they do.  For now it&#x27;s all DIY so, if I join your Aurelia team, I have to spend a bunch of time learning how your testing works?  In my experience, that means your project will most likely have very little testing.",1422316336

8950427,comment,8949662,8949662,0,0,jonstokes,,,"So random that this has popped up now. I should post an update, but I can do a quick one here. This is resolved, but here are the bullet points of what happened and what I learned:<p>- All of my assets were not frozen. 99% of our assets are with Barclays, and we just use Chase so that we can have a local checking account. (Barclays doesn&#x27;t do that in the US.) So everything tied to Chase and our credit cards were frozen because of the tax lien.<p>- The source of the problem was my former CPA. He just screwed up. He&#x27;s a nice guy who does a solid business in the decent-sized midwestern city where he&#x27;s located, but for whatever reason of inattenion and/or lack of good enough training/information, he had me file in the wrong state. He also doesn&#x27;t have any insurance (not required where he practices), so if MA hadn&#x27;t been cool about waiving penalties and interest it may not have been possible for me to recover that from him by the time I paid legal fees, etc.<p>- I got a great MA tax lawyer (Philip S. Olsen, now of Burns and Levinson), and he worked with the Mass. tax authorities to help them understand that I wasn&#x27;t some seedy tax dodger and that this was the fault of my CPA.<p>Now, here&#x27;s what I learned:<p>- Ask your CPA if he or she has insurance, and for how much. Don&#x27;t be shy, because this kind of thing could happen to you. And don&#x27;t think that just because various professionals and bigwigs in town use them, that they&#x27;re either not going to make a mistake or that they have insurance.<p>- There is no bank or credit union, no matter how foreign or local, that would not have frozen my assets in response to the merest hint of a request from MA. Every financial institution in the world is going to roll over for a state government like that, and leave you to sort out of if the request was legit or not. There&#x27;s no place to hide. So Chase isn&#x27;t actually the bad guy here.<p>- MA isn&#x27;t really the bad guy either. The states are strapped for cash, and they&#x27;re turning over every stone for revenue. What caught my CPA was a wrinkle in the tax law about where to file that for decades many CPAs ignored because the states didn&#x27;t have the ability to find and go after such things. (MA was claiming that I owed &quot;Massachusetts-sourced income&quot; because Ars Technica LLC was technically headquartered in Malden.)  But in today&#x27;s world of desperate state governments and networked databases, no CPA can afford to be lazy about anything. To their credit, MA let me re-file and did not penalize. I had to pay state taxes twice for that year, though, because IL&#x27;s books were closed for 2007 and they refused to even consider giving me back the money I erroneously paid them.<p>- This stuff drags out. While our assets were unfrozen pretty quickly, it was the first week of this month that I finally got a letter from MA telling me that the tax lien was officially lifted and that I&#x27;m in the clear.<p>- There is no statute of limitations on taxes. If they find something from literally 20 years ago, they can load it up with penalties and interest and absolutely crush you. So see the point above about making sure your CPA has a platinum-plated insurance policy.",1422316279

I worked on Chrome for a bit while at Google, and saw that it more or less holds together with enough reference counting and smart pointers. At the same time, it still requires a lot of care, and plenty of bugs have been caused by subtle mistakes in this kind of code (which is why Chrome uses a sandbox around the actual rendering engine, because it&#x27;s far too complex to be trustworthy). But even Blink/Chrome is moving to a garbage collector (<a href=""http://www.chromium.org/blink/blink-gc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromium.org/blink/blink-gc</a>) for C++ objects because of all the memory management complexity.<p>What I&#x27;m hoping is that you can <i>have</i> a GC that allows you to avoid all these issues without having to be super-careful all the time, while mitigating the pause issue by reducing the garbage using pools and similar techniques. My hypothesis is that most of the little allocations that game engines perform are homogenous enough that moving them to pools will be fairly easy. And that this will be sufficient to avoid big pauses. But we&#x27;ll see how it plays out in practice when I get some hard data on big scenes.<p>Finally, memory management isn&#x27;t the only reason I&#x27;d prefer to avoid C++.

That wasn&#x27;t my point <i>at all</i>. I merely said that proper research about how X works makes no sense if you don&#x27;t even know why X matters in the first place. It&#x27;s like teaching a robot how the internet works when it doesn&#x27;t grasp why the internet matters in the first place. It&#x27;s not an argument that says &#x27;you just don&#x27;t get it&#x27;, it&#x27;s just me saying &#x27;people can&#x27;t be bothered to read about how bitcoin works if they don&#x27;t even care because they don&#x27;t know why bitcoin matters&#x27;.<p>But fine turn it into a red herring then attack me and compare me with now famous idiots in the 2000 recession. Great point.<p>> Looking at your first HN post, you were telling people to buy it when it was over $600. People who listened to you would have lost 60% of their money. I&#x27;m the one who &quot;doesn&#x27;t get it&quot; though.<p>Looking at my first HN post I can&#x27;t see me telling anyone to buy it <i>at all</i>. Now I can see why you don&#x27;t get it, you&#x27;ve made up your mind and you color the entire world around you to support that point.<p>Anyway I&#x27;m glad you pointed Gold out, the thing valued way beyond its industrial value, as the awesome example of something having value for its usefulness, when a global decentralized ledger which can&#x27;t be forged, has durable, portable, divisible and uniform tokens, apparently is useless and has no value because it&#x27;s brought about by &#x27;worthless hashes&#x27; (which obviously aren&#x27;t worthless because millions are spent on doing them and they offer the qualities of security of said ledger, you know, sort of an important and valuable component)<p>It&#x27;s also great you pointed gold out when Gold, like Bitcoin, when adjusted for inflation was priced at $1200 at one point, and traded at $350 at a later point. Hell it was closer to $2k even. Even when not adjusted for inflation that&#x27;s literally about 60% lost, hey almost like bitcoin?<p>And like bitcoin, if you actually zoom out and not cherry pick particular timeframes (like say, in the past few days when if you had $100k in bitcoin, you&#x27;d suddenly have $130k, because volatility goes both ways), you&#x27;d see bitcoin grew in price by 100x in 2013, and thousands of x over the past few years. I think everyone of us will sign up for a couple thousand x in a few years, no? But hey, better just cherrypick when something bad happens, then dig to someone&#x27;s very first post (I wonder if you read them all?) and then lie saying I told people to buy bitcoin when I didn&#x27;t. Your silly argument would&#x27;ve had as much value as when the price of bitcoin crashed from $30 to $2: none. Unless of course that was the end of the story, but it wasn&#x27;t as bitcoin later went to $260 or $1200. That it&#x27;s volatile and risky is a given, nobody denies it, and it&#x27;s the very reason I recommend to almost everyone I know to buy bitcoin.<p>Anyway don&#x27;t take these points as me trying to justify bitcoin by its price, I&#x27;m merely putting context to your ad hominem attack (&#x27;oh look he tried to sell you bitcoin and the price went down! what a fraud! and bitcoin too!&#x27;). I wouldn&#x27;t mind as much if I had actually told people in my first post to buy bitcoin, when I didn&#x27;t. In reality, I&#x27;d only encourage someone to buy bitcoin if they understand the risks, can handle the risks financially, and have a specific user case (whether it&#x27;s long-term investment, or buying bitcoin for a few minutes to use it to transfer value quickly and cheaply for remittance using the network as a fiat-to-fiat international transfer that can beat WesternUnion rates).<p>If you don&#x27;t feel safe holding bitcoin, that&#x27;s completely fine by me, it&#x27;s a very valid point and I&#x27;m the first one to say that billions of people today would feel the same and I&#x27;d agree with them, too.",1422314434

Time passes, and Chase processes a levy on behalf of a collections agency authorized to collect for the state department of revenue. They had automatically been calculating tax owed for one FTE, even though we had never filed a statement indicating we were withholding. Then fees, interest, penalties, etc. added up and it made for a very bad day or two here.<p>It took a few calls between us, Chase and the state agency, and a simple form to get the levy order rescinded before Chase fulfilled it (30 days after their receipt, for most such orders).

In fact, the TLS Working Group had a draft - but then I think the chairs decided to consult the Cryptographic Forum Working Group at the IRTF for recommendations (despite CFRG already having said &quot;yes, Curve25519 is basically fine&quot; at the meeting before that).<p>In retrospect, this may have been a mistake. CFRG is <i>not</i> good at making choices. It led to months of delay and quite frankly bitter argument about recommendations for new curves. After a bit of discussion about choosing reasonable criteria, which seemed pretty straightforward at the time, it all went a bit pear-shaped.<p><i>(Disclaimer: the below is my own personal impression of events; an opinionated rant from someone involved with the process, not a precise factual recollection, which you can find - mostly - by looking at the CFRG list. Please do not quote me here.)</i><p>Microsoft Research came in with a we&#x27;ve-been-working-on-it-for-years &#x27;nothing up my sleeves&#x27; curve generation method, all shiny and matching exactly what the TLS WG asked for… except amongst other things the curves didn&#x27;t have complete addition laws like Curve25519 did, and their reference implementation&#x27;s fast comb algorithm was very neat but they were <i>very conveniently</i> &quot;unaware&quot; that they&#x27;d filed a patent on it [or, at least, an algorithm that bears a stunning resemblance to it according to Mike, and with which I personally concur]. Despite, y&#x27;know, apparently doing a careful legal review to release it under Apache2? Hm. (Not that that&#x27;d <i>ever</i> impact another implementation, like say, everything not Apache2-compatible…?) We&#x27;d probably never have noticed, except for a very heated off-list thread I had the dubious pleasure to be involved in (…wow). But that patent wasn&#x27;t about the curve generation algorithm itself, so apparently that was <i>perfectly okay</i> according to them, because you could always use a slower technique for the curves generated thus? - not that they were willing to confirm that the patent actually covered that comb algorithm, and they&#x27;ll get back to us, but they never did, so Mike Hamburg disclosed it on-list just in case, and, well, yes.<p>Then we were going to have a nice performance bakeoff with SUPERCOP and the candidates (and to the extent that we did, Curve25519 still won at the ≈WF128 level, even with ECCLib using the patented comb).<p>Then the Brainpool guys and their pet hardware (with repurposed RSA multipliers) came in wanting random curves… basically, Brainpool. Pointing out they&#x27;d already <i>got</i> Brainpool, didn&#x27;t really alleviate that, they wanted a new one and they wanted everyone to use that. That went down like a lead zeppelin. (Random curves run like pants if you don&#x27;t have pet hardware with generic multipliers, by the way: grab OpenSSL 1.2 and test for yourself.)<p>Then agl it seems Had A Word With the MSR guys offlist; after that Discussion they did a revised curve generation draft along with the hardware people, and what came out the other end (not) coincidentally generated <i>almost</i> Curve25519, which was a huge change in position for MSR. A little more discussion and then it <i>actually</i> matched Curve25519 later, agl did a draft merging that with the 25519 draft proposed earlier!<p>So we now have a draft adopted for us to argue about in the next phase, which seems right now to be in even more pointless bikeshedding about whether the wire format should be little-endian (because all the existing software for this curve does it) or big-endian (because meaningless traditions in honour of dead architectures; traditions we&#x27;re explicitly allowed to ignore), which by the way the TLS WG already did with their draft, and decided &#x27;keep it as it is, little-endian&#x27;. Or, more usefully, if there&#x27;s value in wire formats beyond Montgomery-x - there&#x27;s always going to be trade-offs there, perhaps it depends if we&#x27;re going to have the same wire format for key agreement and signatures and other stuff, and we actually don&#x27;t have to so maybe we can just make the best decision for each, if we can actually <i>make</i> decisions that is.<p>And this is <i>before</i> even getting into signatures, which is barely-discussed and a <i>long</i> way from reaching consensus.<p>Long story short - as long as you&#x27;re not baking anything in unchangeably: yes, just go ahead and implement X25519 (that&#x27;s the key-exchange algorithm formerly known as Curve25519, yes) exactly as djb did it, because it&#x27;s what we <i>ought</i> to end up with anyway. Better still, use a good, well-tested routine already out there for it; the latest donna maybe, or libsodium, or NaCl. Better use a temporary codepoint for it until TLS WG assign one. I&#x27;m guessing Rich and agl may be taking a broadly similar approach, but that&#x27;s for them. It certainly wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to patch in. I haven&#x27;t got a clue about where we&#x27;ll end up with signatures I&#x27;m afraid, so I&#x27;m just using Ed25519, like GnuPG and SSH have, which I think is Pretty Good (pun intended) but about which I know there&#x27;s some disagreement.<p><i>Guh</i>.

Reminds me of a player piano.<p>It uses a daisywheel, I can&#x27;t believe how fast that thing rotates. If you could control the input to the daisywheel you&#x27;d be in business. No idea how hard it would be to reverse engineer it, not my area of expertise, but it seems doable.<p>I did see somebody at a maker faire a few years back who made a typewriter that wrote out tweets, you could tweet at the machine and it would print it out. Pretty cool, but I think it was a long labor of love and not necessarily easily replicated. You should be able to find something about it with a few searches, I think they were out of Kitchener-Waterloo?",1422313439

They used to add value in 2 ways: 1) a shop window on the high street to display homes for sale, and 2) the ability to produce high quality photographs and printed brochures.

The industry seems highly vulnerable to disruption, and while there are some promising alternatives out there [1], most homes are still sold through traditional estate agents. Why?<p>My best guess is that sellers feel uncomfortable showing strangers around their home and negotiating on price, and avoiding this discomfort is worth the agent&#x27;s fee.

we are trying to design the simplest e-commerce platform ever (thought for &quot;the makers&quot; - See Up&Sell.me).<p>We want to share our &quot;vision&quot; (and ask for a feedback). 
At present, in the e-commerce space we see 2 kinds of players: 1) the retailers and 2) the makers.<p>1) THE RETAILERS. The retailers typically have big product catalogs (x00/x.000 products). 
If they are really big they use enterprise e-commerce platforms (e.g. Demandware), if they are medium or small they use e-commerce platforms which are more simple (e.g. Shopify). The e-commerce platforms thought for this target (retailers) are designed on the metaphor of the &quot;shop + catalog + shopping cart&quot;.<p>2) THE MAKERS. The makers typically have smaller product catalogs (x/x0) products, they don&#x27;t use &quot;classic&quot; e-commerce platforms (even if someone, among the biggest, is using Shopify), but they use tools like Gumroad, Sellfy, Selz & co. 
The e-commerce platforms thought for this target (makers) are not designed on the metaphor of the &quot;shop + catalog + shopping cart&quot; but they are designed on the metaphor of &quot;product page + checkout&quot;. 
The product page + checkout is the core of the platform.<p>With Up&Sell.me we are trying to disrupt this second market. 
In this space, we have competitors which are trying to position themselves as an alternative to Paypal. It is to say that they are trying to position themselves as a sort of &quot;payment institution&quot; for the long tail. On the contrary, we are going in the opposite direction. 
We don&#x27;t want to become a payment institution, but we want to become the &quot;Shopify for the makers&quot;. 
It is tu say, we want to design the simplest e-commerce platform ever for the makers.<p>We strongly believe that there is a huge market space for an e-commerce platform designed for the long tail of the makers and we still don&#x27;t see the &quot;de facto&quot; platform for this target.<p>What do you think of this vision?

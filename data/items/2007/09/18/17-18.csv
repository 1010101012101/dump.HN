He's obviously a smart guy and usually has thought provoking and interesting essays.  He often looks at things from a different perspective and I like that a lot, although I don't always agree with his conclusions.  I've also followed along with his Y Combinator ""seed investment firm.""  However, I've never applied to Y Combinator or even considered applying because I've always felt like he leans heavily toward the Ivy League crowd. ",1190138142

56401,comment,56394,56394,0,0,ericb,,,"I have found in my last several startup attempts that I'm wasting (using) far more time on design-related issues than I would care to.  It is the one obstacle that bars me from running full-speed with my ideas.  Specifically, I think that if you look at giving equity to a designer justify it using the same <a href=""<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/equity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/equity.html</a>"">Equity Equation</a> it looks favorable.  However the equity equation lets you figure out a max, but not what is typical.<p>In this particular instance, we have a working app running and the basic design is done, but it needs fine tuning and ongoing love.  In general I'm wondering what a fair-shake would be for a partner in starting a new project. I'm also interested in the general case, too, of a brand-new startup.\n",1190137870

HotOrNot, LiveJournal, FuckedCompany, Blogger, Del.icio.us.<p>I think the biggest predictor of success during a bust tends to be low costs.  Recessions force honesty on business people: you are economically viable if you contribute more value (actual value, not predicted value) than you consume in resources.  It's relatively easy for one guy working out of his home to produce more value than he consumes.  If his product is at all useful, he's basically got it covered.  It's relatively difficult for a startup with $20M of financing to produce more than it consumes, because his product has to be roughly 200 times more useful than the solo entrepreneur.",1190137138

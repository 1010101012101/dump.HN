A single counterexample, contrary to what you seem to think, doesn&#x27;t invalidate a theory--it&#x27;s driven by multiple lines of evidence. And ESR&#x27;s strategy of digging through comments of source code to quote out of context fragments doesn&#x27;t even approach providing a single counterexample, particularly when he admits that he&#x27;s in a quest to show that climate scientists are a conspiracy, part Gaian-religionists and part KGB psyops.

Yes, you are right, all of those things can be fun to write for fun&#x27;s sake, but I agree that it&#x27;s stupid to try to write all of that yourself if your goal is to be productive and complete a game.<p>My point is, why do I have to use their dopey editor to get at it? Why aren&#x27;t these things libraries, dependencies that I manage just like any other project I&#x27;ve built since the dawn of time?<p>For Unity, I can definitely see the appeal of a good &quot;game builder&quot; type application. Game builders have been around forever. Traditionally, game builders were crap, so to see Unity create something that can be used to make games that people are selling, for real money, is pretty cool. Unity was never going to be my cup of tea, but that&#x27;s fine.<p>But for UE4, Epic has been a long-time vendor of AAA-quality game engines. I expected a series of libraries for doing the vast majority of things, plus workflow tools for things like baking lighting into textures. That&#x27;s what I mean about &quot;what ever happened to writing code?&quot; The way you used to wire up a game engine with your models and your gameplay scripts was to write code, not draw boxes in a flowchart editor. Command-line oriented build tools for processing scripts and packing textures and encoding audio and cross compiling <i>could</i> be abstracted through a GUI, but were still available to plunk down on a build server so you weren&#x27;t wasting cycles on your workstation. I still get the feeling that that is in there somewhere. But where? I just can&#x27;t imagine a professional game dev house using the UE4 editor.",1433995002

What is considered &quot;technically correct&quot; has changed somewhat over the years. I believe Sixth Edition was the first attempt to standardize and make consistent card text. Generally though cards that do the same or very similar things are going to follow consistent word ordering.<p>For example take Shrewd Hatchling[2] and Coral Reef[3]. Both are fairly different cards, but notice the wording of the first part of their respective card text:<p>> Shrewd Hatchling enters the battlefield with four -1/-1 counters on it.<p>and<p>> Coral Reef enters the battlefield with four polyp counters on it.<p>Cards with that sort of ability are (almost) always going to have it phrased in a way that fits the pattern of &quot;<card name> enters the battlefield with <n> <type> counters on it.&quot;<p>Lots of other sorts of common mechanics are the same. Additionally, there are the so called &quot;Golden Rules&quot;[4] which are important to take note of when parsing the text of a card.<p>While Googling for links for this reply I found Gleemin[5], a &quot;rules engine that aims to fully and correctly implement the game&#x27;s tournament rules, an AI player programmable with expert knowledge and an interpreter for the game&#x27;s language (the rules text on the cards)&quot;!

You&#x27;d have to be pretty zany to leap to the conclusion that the paper had anything to do with censorship.<p>It would look worse if one of its co-authors (Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil) received funding from the DoD to study the propagation of information through social media online (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01383.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01383.pdf</a>) as part of DARPA SMISC - a strategic communications (DoD term for propaganda) research group that studies how information flows on social media and how to direct and disrupt it.<p>Many researchers take grants from all over though, and anything in this area of study is likely to get investment from the DoD. So still it&#x27;s more reasonable to think that, since he works in that area, of course he will receive DoD funding.<p>Yet it was posted with 22 likes to NATO&#x27;s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/StratComCOE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/StratComCOE</a>), a Facebook wall also contains a review of a book called &quot;The Weaponization of Social Media&quot; and announces its participation in a conference on “Cyberattacks and Propaganda: the Battlefield of Future”.<p>As evidenced (again) as recently as this week by a group of people who run an anti-TPP website, there is an inter-website system for blocking posts to certain content (<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/38pmg8/hey_reddit_someone_is_trying_really_hard_to_erase/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/38pmg8/hey_redd...</a>) - Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, etc all simultaneously blocked this website.

While the history of the United States Government in applying strategic communication and information support to US audiences has been slippery, and the Smith-Mundt Act (anti-propaganda law) was recently weakened under the justification that global interconnectedness of conversation, news and social media makes it difficult to prevent US propaganda intended for foreign audiences from making it back home.<p>The new CEO of Reddit is on the board of a Washington Defense Thinktank.

The second was primarily purely technical, but did have some more theoretical/project-management-y type of questions. In neither one was I required to write any code.<p>On-site: one interview was entirely whiteboard-coding (in a collaborative style), on a set of related generic problems. Next was one with a set of problems related to my experience. Third was almost entirely telling war stories. Last two were some generic graph-theory-type problems and some simple problems involving data structures relevant to the my area of experience.<p>As I hadn&#x27;t interviewed for anything in 11 years, I did spend some time brushing up on my basic algorithmic theory, and essentially followed Steve Yegge&#x27;s suggestions. I honestly think I probably could have done the vast majority of it without any studying, but spending time practicing solving problems on paper (with a countdown-timer as an artificial pressure-inducing device) certainly did help me, I think, in the on-site. No amount of memorization could have helped with most of it, aside from basic knowledge that anyone who&#x27;s taken Data Structures should know.<p>I didn&#x27;t find the process to be insulting at all; it was an enjoyable challenge.

Like with many things, its about having experience, knowing whats a good fit, and knowing why something similar isn&#x27;t a good fit.<p>Certainly - every single time you choose an algorithm, and then decide on a particular way to implement it - you could in theory, implement each algorithm in 10 different ways and then choose the best one after benchmarking. But that would be a huge drag on productivity. And if you had to choose 5 algorithms for 5 different tasks then it quickly becomes a quadratic complexity time sink. It would be far better to just know via experience. Its kind of like in chess - the better players just KNOW that certain paths lead to less favourable winning odds.

I just screwed around each day, telling myself that the <i>next</i> day would be ""super hardcore work day"" and every following day would <i>have</i> to follow suit.<p>I eventually snapped out of it, but it took that whole week of just recharging my batteries to get back into it. I even managed to start working a few times during that drought and I always stopped almost immediately afterwards, never getting into the zone.<p>Maybe it's the nature of the work, maybe it's a common character flaw of people who do our work, I don't know. All I know is you're certainly not alone.",1225165643

I didn't do it because the signup page told me I was actually signing up for a Wordpress account and I needed to choose a handle I could never ever change. I wanted an icon, not to make an irrevocable decision and sign up for some unrelated site, so I gave up. The author writes ""Gravatar was a feature""; I felt the same way: I was left wondering why GitHub would outsource a feature for another company to confuse.<p>Lots of nice history here, though.

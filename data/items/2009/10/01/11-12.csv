854737,comment,854477,854477,0,0,tetha,,,"Meh, this is not useful.<p>The first thing: static typing is not static typing (yes, twice) dynamic typing is not weak typing is not strong typing. C is borderline static typing. Certainly, you have to say 'yes, this foo is an integer, this bar is a char<i></i>' and the compiler will complain if you do foo = bar... but on the other hand, something like <i>((char</i>)(void<i>)(&foo)) will probably work (untested). I am not aware of these such possibilities in Haskell.<p>Furthermore, Haskell (for example) is statically typed, but I don't have to annotate everything with types, compared to, say, C, C# (even though this comparision is unfair, as Type inference in OOP-Languages requires exponential time). This is also a pretty big difference in 'static languages'. (In fact, Haskell and Python programs appear to converge to a certain common structure, which is very interesting).<p>The second thing: dynamic typing vs dynamic typing. What about weak typing vs strong typing? Python is dynamically typed, by Python is strongly typed, so an Integer is an Integer and remains an Integer unless told otherwise. In weakly typed languages, this is not the case. So just 'dynamic' is not useful either.<p>And then, the paradigms. Argh. Those hurt my eyes by now. OCaml is functional, and Haskell is functional. Haskell is </i>pure<i>, Ocaml is not. This is a gigantic major difference, let alone the </i>functional subsets* of other languages. OOP? Hah. Just consider Icons inheritance vs Javas inheritance. Javas inheritance goes most specific towards least specific, overriding methods. Icon goes least specific towards most specific, giving the subclass implementor extension points where he can add further functionality. And don't even start to think about Common Lisps object orientation, or dylans, which is entirely different. Those terms, in my opinion, are far far too broad in order to describe a language well. Certainly, you might get a feeling what ML is, if I say ""ML is functional"", but overall, you know nothing about the code. (And don't even think about multi-paradigm languages).<p>So, overall: The table does not really tell anything, especially if you consider that major languages are missing. Even some toy example like faculty or fibonacci in each of these languages would tell everyone more than this.",1254397900

If you want to make that claim, you need to support it. Without going into highly technical details, I explained some ways why the usage could make sense. Your response was simply to say, as if declaring it somehow makes it true, that there is no reason for the usage.<p><i>There is nothing anecdotal about my experience. If I have to blink and think twice about what someone is saying, then he is using nonstandard idiom.</i><p>By definition your experience is anecdotal. I doubt you have to think twice when someone says it, but we’d have to subject you to an experiment to be sure. But simply put, there are so many cognitive biases that may potentially be at work that you really can’t reliably judge yourself whether it takes you longer to process. Sentence processing happens on the order of tens of milliseconds.<p><i>That stuff can fossilize, doesn't mean we should let it fossilize.</i><p>You’re assuming that you have some control over whether the use develops in the language. I’m saying that’s a flawed assumption and that you don’t.<p>If you’re so sure the usage is wrong, it may be interesting to note how many hits there are for each phrase in Google’s index:<p><pre><code>  2,220,000 for ""could care less""\n  1,410,000 for ""couldn't care less""\n</code></pre>\nI readily admit that this, too, is anecdotal evidence.

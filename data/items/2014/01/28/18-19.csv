That and the stories about the Oculus Rift consumer-grade VR goggles have got me thinking a lot about healthful life experiences in the digital age. What will prevent people from “going to Paris” in their Rifts and thinking they’ve got that checkbox filled? The Grand Canyon, Machu Pichu, what have you.<p>On the other hand, what’s the difference? Such a person who would accept the simulation in place of the real experience might not have the means or capacity to appreciate the real thing, and more significantly would have never bothered going there in the first place. Maybe exposure on even that small of a scale—though not as valuable as the real thing—comes at so much less of a cost that the net result is positive: a greater awareness of and sensitivity to the wild expanse of the world.",1390935540

7138956,comment,7136994,7138494,4,0,jerf,,,"Evolution is not infinitely powerful. As we continue to develop our technology we will eventually reach a point where conventional (un-technology-assisted) evolution will be unable to compete with our directed attacks. This really starts getting close to that; this mechanism for gene silencing is not something that the organisms can afford to just &quot;turn back off&quot;, for instance. This is extremely potent and going to be very difficult to evolve around. Not <i>impossible</i>, but very difficult; as soon as we identify something that has managed, we can probably find another sequence to throw at it. Since the organism is not unconstrained in what DNA sequences it can choose, since it is also the actual code the organism is running, it faces a lot more constraints than we do, which is a true reversal of the current situation.<p>Evolution <i>qua</i> evolution won&#x27;t care, and will swiftly and smoothly move into the technology arena as much as ever, but it will be a different game at that point. Intelligences may spar at each other, but brute biology won&#x27;t have a seat at the table anymore. And intelligences at least have a <i>chance</i> to compromise at something less that all out war, which is all brute biology has ever known and all it can ever know.",1390935442

With the Rift and decent headphones, it&#x27;s truly a <i>Being John Malkovich</i> / <i>Strange Days</i> experience.  VR goggles can convey that experience much better than a TV/movie screen ever could. Ex: Avatars in the Rift have personal space.

That’s why the kudos feature annoys me – it falsely represents the page to be popular, but rather than just completely making up a number of kudos like a normal liar, it ties the number of kudos to the actions of unwitting page visitors.

7138875,comment,7138018,7138018,9,0,marknutter,,,"I&#x27;ve worked on large javascript applications written in Ember, Angular, JavsacriptMVC (now can.js), and jQuery and the conclusion I&#x27;ve come to is that things have not settled down in the world of front-end development enough to justify a framework as opinionated as Ember. For example, Ember relies very much on routing being handled a certain way. In fact, much of the magic in Ember comes from the fact that it&#x27;s making a lot of assumptions about how routes are handled, constructed, and organized. This is great if you can assume that an app&#x27;s routes will be written in a very traditional way, aka one route per page. It breaks down however when you want to tie different routes to two or more components on the same page (i.e. two different tabbed sections). One concern per route makes perfect sense on the server when serving a traditional stateful web application but it often doesn&#x27;t make sense for rich desktop-style applications (which is probably why Photoshop doesn&#x27;t have urls).<p>Data persistence on the client is another area I feel hasn&#x27;t been nailed down in general and thus can&#x27;t support a lot of opinionated assumptions. Should data be persisted at all? Ember caches data from all requests to the server in a &quot;store&quot;, but it&#x27;s not clear how you keep that cache up-to-date. Perhaps you could use websockets to keep resources current but at the time I was using Ember there wasn&#x27;t a clear, well supported way to do that. I think the jury is still out on whether we should be duplicating our schema on the front-end at all but Ember-Data has gone all-in on mimicking ActiveRecord. Again, the dust has not settled in a lot of areas of the front-end development world as far as I&#x27;m concerned so I don&#x27;t feel comfortable with these decisions being made for me.<p>I tend to lean toward convention over configuration. On the server I&#x27;m a big Rails fan but I feel like it&#x27;s solving problems that aren&#x27;t moving targets. On the front end I prefer Angular because it solves the main headaches (two-way binding, testability, modularity) of front-end development without being too opinionated about the stuff we haven&#x27;t reached consensus on.",1390934661

They both get compiled to bytecode instructions that get executed by a virtual machine (basically a software program that is pretending to be a processor). The source code for that virtual machine is written in C or C++. In order to execute Java code or Python code, the machine must have the VM installed. But it doesn&#x27;t matter what type of processor you are running the code on, just as long as it has the VM installed.<p>A C/C++ compiler takes your source code and then compiles & assembles it to binary machine instructions that are executed directly by the processor. It is not necessary to have a C/C++ compiler installed on a machine in order to execute that binary. But the code must have been compiled to the machine language that type of chip understands. That&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t take a program that was compiled for an Intel chip and then go run it on an ARM chip. The different chip won&#x27;t understand the instructions. So you have to compile the C source separately for each type of target chip.<p>That&#x27;s why C is considered more low-level than Java and Python. The output of the compiler is executed directly by your processor hardware, instead of by a VM.",1390934217

So I tracked news and anecdotes. Vinod prided himself on being a tough negotiator on behalf of his portfolio companies. But various other stories of negotiating hard against entrepreneurs were out there.<p>I should clarify that in the 1980s, even more than recently, there was a general screw-the-founder philosophy among VCs. I once asked a popular and likeable VC what some rules of thumb were for equity splits.

For example OWASP study lists CSRF as easier to prevent than XSS: <a href=""http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%...</a> To me this makes sense, XSS vulnerability can be introduced anywhere in your application code, CSRF can be dealt with in a single middleware, which greatly simplifies prevention.<p>How about https only cookies? Can you enforce that tokens won&#x27;t ever be send over http? Can your enforcement work in a presence of XSS (as is the case with a combination of  &#x27;secure&#x27; and &#x27;httponly&#x27; cookie flags).<p>With tokens it is easier to do authenticated cross origin requests. But a new mechanism may be vulnerable to a new class of vulnerability, where a web app will be tricked to make such requests to evil domains (it may sound unrealistic, but remember that CSRF was discovered many years after cookies were introduced).<p>Cookies can also require no server side state. You can put signed, encrypted content in them and many frameworks support this, which shrinks a list of token benefits a bit.<p>I do think that token based approach is more elegant from the architecture point of view, because you don&#x27;t need to deal with two different authentication schemes to support browser traffic and API calls, but I&#x27;ll still stay with cookies for browser auth.",1390933251

7138607,comment,7138018,7138018,3,0,nathanhammond,,,"Zombie Code Apocalypse: I would love to help you identify what it is that caused that problem. I don&#x27;t suspect that it is an issue with Ember itself, though note that the Ember resolver <i>will</i> load code when you store it in `App.Foo(Controller|View|Route|...)` if that code is &quot;needed&quot; (say, by visiting the Foo route). So, unless you commented out the entire declaration it is entirely possible for that code to execute.<p>Spontaneously Changing Values: What was the key that you were trying to set? On what type of object (Route, View, Controller, etc.)? There are indeed some special values and it might be something that Ember can warn you of in the console as well as be documented. I&#x27;ll be glad to make some documentation changes that make this issue easier to catch if you can provide me reproduction.<p>Godlike Refactoring: I work on a team with a widely distributed level of skills. One of my favorite features of Ember (which both has and will continue to save me hundreds of hours) is the fact that even if you make a mess of something you can generally come back and clean it up one piece at a time. My metaphorical description of this is that &quot;all of the crap is in nice neat little piles instead of spread on the walls.&quot;<p>JavaScript.next: In the next/current version of JS both of these warts should be possible to resolve using Modules and Object.defineProperties(). I firmly believe that your complaints are not centered around Ember (which I honestly believe is insulating you from the worst of it) but instead from flaws in a language that was literally designed and built in an incredibly short time (my recollection is &quot;a week&quot; but I can&#x27;t find a source).<p>(Edited for clarity based upon mixonic&#x27;s reply.)",1390932406

Worked well enough, but I was never convinced that it was an especially effective way of testing.<p>If your test oracle is code itself, then it&#x27;s not unlikely you&#x27;ll make the same bug twice. I can&#x27;t find the paper I&#x27;m after, but NASA did some work here.<p>If your test oracle isn&#x27;t code, you have the problem of working out the correct outputs for the entire function space (at which point maybe you&#x27;d be better off with some kind of look-up table anyway)<p>The next problem is your input combinations grow much faster than you are able to test. Most functions don&#x27;t just work on one float (which is very feasible) but they might work on three or four streams of input, and keep internal state.<p>The moment you have these combinations you run into massive problems of test execution time, even if you can parallelise really well.<p>Butler and Finelli did some work <a href=""http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~tashbook/fall2009/cse308/butler-finelli-infeasibilit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~tashbook/fall2009/cse308/butle...</a> also at NASA investigating if doing a sample of the input space was worthwhile, but their conclusion was that it isn&#x27;t helpful, and that any statistical verification is infeasible.<p>In my report I ended up concluding that it isn&#x27;t a particularly useful approach.

These cards can be swiped as either a debit card (requiring a PIN, similar to Interac) or a credit card (requiring only a signature, or nothing at all in some cases, like a gas pump).  They don&#x27;t force you to use it as a debit card because that would preempt certain transactions, like online ones.  (My theory is that this is part of why the US has a far bigger online economy than Canada, beyond simple population density.)<p>Canada also has far stronger central controls on, for example, their banking system than does the US.

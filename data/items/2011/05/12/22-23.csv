2542656,comment,2541818,2542356,15,0,hristov,,,"For markets to work one must try to get as much trading as possible on them. Only if the majority of trading happens on markets will markets be able to effectively discover prices.<p>If one puts such artificial limitations on markets, than there is always a danger that people will not trade there. If people trade in side deals instead of the markets, then markets would not be able to discover prices and all kinds of inefficiencies would result from the uncertain prices. For example if you put in your limitation, there will be occasions where both buyers and sellers will want to buy and sell at a certain price but the exchange will simply not let them. In this case the buyers and sellers will try to meet and do the transaction outside of the exchange and that is usually a bad thing.<p>I think there are other ways this can be fixed. For example one may even the playing field by simply adding a clock to the market so that all trades must happen on clock ""ticks"". This would prevent the advantage of HFT. Or the exchanges could just stop selling offer data to the HFT people. This would not cause the market problems discussed above, because it would only remove things that actual market participants do not have anyways. Thus, these measures would not remove any actual supply or demand from the market.<p>The solutions are not hard to figure, the problem is that exchanges do not want to implement them. Exchanges make a lot of extra money from HFT and want to keep and grow that money even if endangers uncertainty in their markets.",1305240259

We're engaged with some reputable security consultants to ensure that we're delivering what we promise.  We'll have (lots) more to say about that in the coming weeks and months.<p>The second component of trust is being a trustworthy, transparent company. Building that kind of trust takes time and presence in the industry and the community.

Seriously, we're passionate about making it easier for people to live car-free, which will help create a world with far fewer cars on the road, less pollution, and big savings (or income!) for all. I know that sounds crazy, but some smart people at The Economist, New York Times and Time Magazine have all said very nice things about us.<p>We are looking for an experienced engineer who has a passion for development and an appreciation for Agile development methodologies, such as short-development iterations, test driven development and refactoring. You'll be responsible for making some real cool stuff happen. So, roll up a sleeve, put on one of the many hats you're going to wear, and come join the fun!<p>Responsibilities:\n	Produce high-quality code using software engineering best practices.\n	Ensure proper technical design and documentation.\n	Proactively identify areas for improvement/scaling our current architecture and application design to keep pace with the growth and performance demands of our members and product roadmap.\n	Clearly understand key technical components and drive them forward in innovative ways.\n	Provide architectural input to project related decisions.\n	Develop tools and utilities to diagnose (and fix!) performance problems.\n	Be key participant in iterative Agile development process. We design, build, and evaluate features in very short periods of time. \n	Be able to work efficiently in a constantly changing and growing environment where the process is fluid and creative and unique solutions are desired.<p>Qualifications:\n	3+ years of professional coding experience.\n	BS in Computer Science or related field.\n	Extensive programming experience in Java.\n	Experience with mobile development (Android, iPhone or mobile optimized web sites) is a plus.  Interest in mobile development is a requirement.\n	Ability to clearly articulate complex technical and business issues to a wide variety of audiences.\n	Experience in Agile methods.\n	Solid experience documenting code and designs.\n	A critical eye for design and usability.\n	Ability to take a task and deliver on it.\n	Outstanding written and oral communication skills.\n	Previous start-up experience is a strong plus.<p>Salary: Competitive salary, based on experience, plus equity.<p>How to Apply: please submit your resume along with a cover letter to jobs@relayrides.com",1305239347

And it's very much a player in the tech space. How many of us use AWS?<p>Google has a solid business platform and has definitely made it by all measures.<p>Netflix is another example. Good product, has upset the industry, sky's the limit type stuff.<p>Could all of these golden companies fail? Absolutely. For example, look at Microsoft right now - they are still innovating in some spaces, but really struggling in others. Will they go the way of IBM? (Hey, I hope so, but let's not start dreaming now).<p>Then there's Facebook and Twitter - arguably the stars of the current tech bubble. Are they worth what people say they are?

It does take some mental re-training though. Once you've grown accustomed to it, it scans really nicely, and while it's very possible to write code that's difficult to visually parse, good programmers will use parentheses when they improve clarity, and omit them when they don't.<p>It helps a LOT to remember that in Coffeescript, you're more or less never naming functions - you're just passing around a bunch of lambdas.

What's important is how the CEO reacts when someone under him screws up at the expense of customers, stockholders, or both.<p>Case in point, the Sony rootkit fiasco.  Products go out the door with Sony's name on them, equipped with a 'feature' that would get any of us little people hauled before a judge on criminal charges.   Response from the executive suite?  Promote the manager responsible to President of the Global Digital Business division.  Fast forward a few years, and consumers are still wandering around with confused, vaguely hurt looks on their faces, wondering why they never seem to get a square deal from Sony.<p>Same situation with Facebook: can a leopard change his spots?",1305237966

2542529,comment,2541189,2541952,39,0,ellyagg,,,"It's so frustrating and terrible to see the situation in NK trivialized by comparing the US's prison systems unfavorably to it. No initiative, no activism, no outcry can be raised because its wind is immediately sucked out by foolish people screaming moral equivalence. How do you think refugees from these gulags would feel to hear you compare the average US prison inmate's experience to their own? Do you acknowledge that some concentration camps can be objectively and morally worse than others?<p>Are there bad prisons in the US? No doubt. Is the average US inmate experience anything like what is the RULE in these gulags? No. Does the scale between the two matter? Yes. Do the crimes (sometimes ""crimes"") and due process issues matter? Yes. Can we go on and on with specific, provable differences which make the NK citizen's experience far more horrifying? Yes.<p>Problems with the prison system in the US belong in their OWN THREAD, where they don't distract from THIS PROBLEM. The fact that some folks feel the overwhelming urge to bring them up here speaks a lot about what they think is important: Scoring points against the US. The US prison system is not relevant to the NK prison system. This isn't a game. NK doesn't get to pick out worst case practices from the US to justify its sweeping unchecked abuses. And it certainly doesn't deserve the aid of willing amateur PR people on random internet message boards.<p>NK is the same country that quietly let millions of its people starve while it spent a large fraction of its total wealth trying to build the tallest hotel in the world! That's the philosophy and those are the priorities of the organization behind these gulags. But you're telling me the REAL story here is the US prison system?<p>But this is why NK gets to go merrily about its way starving and torturing its citizens.",1305237919

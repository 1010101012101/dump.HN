Once I stopped to walk around I would feel myself get incredibly tired/hungry, but in the moment of being engrossed by an experience, it seemed to block everything out.<p>As for darkness specifically, I wonder how active the subjects in complete darkness were, and what kind of reduction of mental activity occurs when you are not constantly processing optical information. Both would seem to me to reduce metabolism and presumably the need for sleep to some degree.",1400183977

7751843,comment,7751110,7751691,19,0,exelius,,,"It&#x27;s not about artists; it&#x27;s about distribution (which eventually makes it back to artists, but that&#x27;s another story entirely).<p>The distribution of media content is controlled through very complex business agreements where the content rights owners assign licenses and limited copy rights to other organizations based on a number of factors, including time windows, geographic restrictions, device restrictions, etc. The content owners generally do not trust the distributors to enforce these restrictions; nor should they (why have 500 implementations of something when you can support 2 or 3?)<p>Enter DRM. When digital copies of content are given to a distributor for distribution, that content is encrypted. Usually this content must be played through a special player that contacts a DRM license server to get a decryption key. One of the things this player does is verify you have an account with rights to play the content. The company you have an account with has certain distribution rights (like the content is only licensed for playback in the UK before December 1, 2014), so the player then checks your location through some mechanism (GPS, geolocation, etc) and the date before decrypting and playing the content. If it&#x27;s after December 1 or you&#x27;re outside the UK, it won&#x27;t play back.<p>Because the player has to be trusted to enforce these restrictions, that rules out any sort of open source player. Even if the default distribution of the player enforced the rules, it would be trivial to modify it and remove this enforcement mechanism. Hence why DRM is so despised by the open source crowd.<p>For better or for worse, these types of distribution agreements are fundamental to how the media industry works. Sometimes rights will get passed along two or three times before they actually make it into the hands of the consumer (e.g. a studio licenses their US movie distribution to Disney, who then licenses a subset of films to Epix, who then licenses a subset of those to Amazon, but only in a certain window). It&#x27;s likely not changing any time soon because as you said, it makes the owners of this IP a lot of money.<p>DRM can be broken relatively easily if piracy is your goal; but the real goal of DRM is to provide content owners control over legal distribution channels.",1400183947

You&#x27;ve provided a content /aggregation/ site that you now have to pay for in order to actually contribute or effect in any way. It isn&#x27;t really about the amount or the method in which you pay, it&#x27;s the fact that you HAVE TO. Reddit is constantly mocking itself and the karma system because people are scamming other to get worthless internet points. Now you want to try and tie a dollar value to that and think that you&#x27;re innovating?<p>Granted I think some of your ideas are actually interesting. Creating a micropayment system for content creators (Note: not content gatherer) to allow more independents to thrive is a wonderful goal. You however seem to be creating exactly the opposite, where money can be quite literally thrown at a post in order to force it into visibility. More so Updn (not sure about valME) has a cost associated with down-voting. Enter Company A which drops, say, 20$ to put in hundreds or thousands of upvotes for a press-release. Users would effectively have to pay to get an advertisement off their front page in order to find anything worth a damn.<p>My final point will relate to your philosophy and as such is totally subjective. I honestly don&#x27;t understand where your remarks about &quot;something for nothing&quot; actually relate in this post, but I find them borderline absurd.

The Huffman compression tables for the guide data which in the license agreement you have to warrant that they are trade secrets and that you won&#x27;t reveal them. I did send the BBC a link to the MythTV source code which contains this trade secret. If you work out who I was working for during this discussion don&#x27;t worry, the content arm of the company was (at least according to the BBC pressuring them the other way as a supplier).<p>And the end result?

First of all as the post above implied, DRM simply doesn&#x27;t advance the goal of &quot;living off one&#x27;s art&quot; in any way. Or to put it in business terms, DRM doesn&#x27;t increase sales (because it doesn&#x27;t reduce piracy). I&#x27;d even say it decreases sales because some users avoid DRMed products and it as well increases piracy (because some pirates see breaking DRM as sport - i.e. they are more likely to direct their attention to a DRMed product to pirate it, rather than to a DRM-free one).<p>Plus, it&#x27;s not legitimate to employ overreaching preemptive policing justified by &quot;need to live off one&#x27;s art&quot;. Same way it&#x27;s not legitimate to violate everyone&#x27;s privacy by installing police cameras in people&#x27;s houses as a preemptive measure against crime.<p><i>> How would content producers possibly deter copying without exerting control on the consumption hardware and software?</i><p>They can&#x27;t deter it. They can reduce it (i.e. turn part of the pirates into paying customers). The way to do it is old and well known, yet many fail to remember it - treat customers with respect (and not as criminals by default). Establish more direct relation with your users, don&#x27;t be a jerk, be user friendly and so on. People appreciate services which are explicitly DRM-free. On the other hand, paranoid attempts to &quot;deter all copying&quot; result in treating all customers as criminals by default, which turns many of them into pirates (i.e. serves exactly the opposite purpose).<p>For some reason not being a jerk and being user  friendly is a novel idea for many legacy publishers which they find hard to digest.

These drugs are cheap to produce, sell for about $5k per weekly or biweekly dose, and that a large and growing number of people are very happy to pay for, because they are well tolerated for as long as they work.

It is censorship and discrimination.<p>This bill makes Comcast and other ISPs your personal internet censor. They will be able to decide who has how much access to you. Although they may not choose to make it &#x27;exactly&#x27; zero access, it may be too close to matter. Partial censorship, or not-as-fast access is still censorship. (Examples from history about drowning out voices and controlling the message).<p>This bill allows Comcast to discriminate against it&#x27;s users.<p>Not only can Comcast (and other ISPs) control how fast you access the internet (which they can already do), this allows them to discriminate against you, based on what information you choose to request. Can&#x27;t afford services that pay off Comcast or that Comcast doesn&#x27;t like? You are less of a person, less deserving of the service you already paid for.<p>This also allow subtle and insidious racial or religious discrimination. Do you watch &#x27;televangelists&#x27; live online? Comcast or other ISPs could decide a different denomination gets a nice stream, while your church gets the &#x27;separate but not equal&#x27; choppy, laggy, broken stream. Do you decide to use services that operate in other countries to talk with family in other nations? Comcast could decide they aren&#x27;t as good as their favorite service that costs more.  Even more critically, that service that they like may not even be allowed by law in the country you are trying to talk to. Live video and voice chat can be hard to hear and understand under good circumstances, if Comcast never fixes problems unless companies &#x27;pay up&#x27;, then they can decide if you can really see your family using the tools available to them.<p>The free market cannot address this problem. Comcast and other ISPs have made this a controlled non-free market. Fair competition isn&#x27;t possible in this space, because of their monopoly/duopoly control, and difficult regulations that they helped write and suit only their business models.<p>All netizens are equal. &quot;Whoever can pay&quot; isn&#x27;t equal. &quot;Whoever we choose&quot; certainly isn&#x27;t equal. Don&#x27;t let Comcast make some &quot;more equal&quot; than others.<p>Overall, I think slowing down a webpage may be the wrong message. Straight up better or worse is the better message. Maybe a &quot;congratulations, your ISP has decided you are worthy of accessing this page. Find out why your ISP thinks it has this right, and why your rights are being signed away.&quot; would be more effective. Or even a big splash with &quot;Comcast has approved this website for viewing.&quot;, which may be REALLY effective if IP block based, to be the actual ISP.",1400181358

While it&#x27;s awesome that we hit our goals and have some early customers for our product on Day 1, it&#x27;s going to be tough to re-attain those users and get them on a monthly subscription once we launch. My guess is we&#x27;ll lose over half of them. That&#x27;s mostly because we&#x27;re using an outside channel (kickstarter) to take payment. Also, I&#x27;m sure there will be some people that just don&#x27;t think the product is what they thought it to be.<p>What KS did do was give us a very easy way to validate the product. We&#x27;re self-funding and basically said... hey, if we can&#x27;t raise $20k, this project likely isn&#x27;t worth investing more time and money in. Granted, we were hopeful, and even assumed we&#x27;d do better, but that&#x27;s the way we looked at it. It&#x27;s basically fail fast with a real timeline. Sometimes (and I&#x27;ve done this before) you can get emotional about a product and not walk away.<p>Running a KS campaign is also a small preview for the marketing you&#x27;ll need to do for the actual product once it&#x27;s launched (example: a post like this). You go through some peaks and valleys and have a 30-day roller-coaster ride. If you end up funding your project, even if it&#x27;s a small amount, that&#x27;s a great feeling of &quot;win&quot; that can carry you through the first few months of your project. Small teams need some early wins to keep positive.<p>I highly recommend it as a replacement for seed funding for software companies. We&#x27;ll likely end up around $40k when we end. That&#x27;ll break down like this.<p>1. $2000 for video.\n2. $4000 in fees.<p>The other $34k will let us operate for a few months as if we were making decent revenue. We&#x27;ll also likely invest more of our own money into the idea now that we know it has an audience. Now it&#x27;s just up to us to deliver on the promise and sign up our customers.<p>One tip I&#x27;d give to people thinking about KS. Keep it simple. You don&#x27;t need to give Tshirts and stuff. If you&#x27;re building software, just build software, don&#x27;t do anything that will take away from you doing that.",1400181077

That makes sense because the 3s, 4s, and 8s are rare and &quot;true 8s&quot; are still most likely to have a high probability on the 7 class, because there are far more 7s in the data. Did you analyze approximate correctness for the probabilities, or consider sampling from the computed probabilities rather than classifying to the highest one, to see where that led?",1400180690

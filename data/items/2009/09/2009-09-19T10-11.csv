Anderson's ACT-R framework is based on cognitive theories and models, and can deliver pretty accurate results.<p>For a more user-friendly tool, take a look at CogTool. You can build or import a prototype UI, create tasks (sets of actions: click this, type that), and let the software evaluate or automatically optimize the interface. Last time I checked they used ACT-R as the cognitive engine, so the results should be accurate.",1253357745

No Iranian should claim that the holocaust didn't happen, because holocaust denial is illegal in Germany. But can an Armenian group claim that Turks committed genocide against them, when it is illegal to make such claims in Turkey?</i><p>It's a complicated mess - just where do you draw the line (beyond what your legally required to do)",1253357577

Lipstick was in use at least as far back as Ancient Egypt (but perhaps by prostitutes I don't know).<p>Fashion appears to be largely cyclic and those cycles have been accelerated recently in a bid to extract more cash from fashion victims. Haute Couture is not so cyclic (but probably the influences are) but then on the whole it's not affordable or useful to the general populous.",1253357567

Vague burblings about XSS just don't cut it.

It is confused with content because it is communicated the same way, the difference is in how it is used.",1253357150

Would you like to buy a watch? Sure it's going to cost you 100 times more than another watch but you can't skimp on quality. This will make you stand out as an individual.

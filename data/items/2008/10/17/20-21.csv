We test the wisdom of retaining earnings by assessing whether retention, over time, delivers shareholders at least $1 of market value for each $1 retained. To date, this test has been met. We will continue to apply it on a five-year rolling basis. As our net worth grows, it is more difficult to use retained earnings wisely.""\nSource: Berkshire Hathaway's Owner's Manual<p>Mr. Buffett:: ""We will either pay large dividends or none at all if we can't obtain more money through re-investment (of those funds).

Being born into money, or with a good intellect, sporting ability, or looks (to name a few other valued traits), that isn't luck?<p>Being born into money is somehow different from the others?<p>Wealth is a proxy for one of the other talents. Wealth has always played a role in our selection process. Smarts, at some point, lead to an accumulation of wealth. Wealth signals, a lot more often than not, good genetic material that was awarded in previous iterations. Wealth offers the carriers of this material a better chance at survival, even if the current generation has regressed to the no-good-frat-boy mean. And if the chances are not availed, wealth is squandered in a few generations.<p>The idea that the wealthy, but dumb get a free ride, ultimately jeopardizing the entire system is foolish. There will always be smart people around to either guide them and their finances for a percentage, or fleece them and penalize them for their ignorance.<p>Enron filtered aggressively for morons.

Because of the type of app it is, I feel like paid advertising is a poor approach for it. I've been considering offering some equity to someone who is an experienced internet marketer - someone who can get writers, and bloggers to provide good coverage.<p>My question is, how would you go about offering the equity to someone? I couldn't give it away and hope the person will be successful, and I can't have them do the work and hope I'm satisfied enough to give them a share, etc. So what is the appropriate process here?<p>Thanks",1224275507

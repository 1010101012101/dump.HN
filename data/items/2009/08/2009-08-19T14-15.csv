772805,comment,768324,770647,0,0,thristian,,,"Back in the early days of HTML standards, there were comparatively few browsers, and comparatively few HTML documents for them to read, and the HTML working group seemed to feel it was reasonable to release updated standards that specified what browsers should do with conforming markup, and assumed that non-conforming markup would be rare or wildly broken enough that nobody would depend on any particular behaviour.<p>In the modern age, we know that broken and non-conforming markup is the vast majority of content on the Web, and not only does this content depend on certain parsing behaviours, but those parsing behaviours are fairly reliably implemented across browsers. Of course, that interoperability is far from perfect, and took vast effort to achieve (legend has it that in early versions of IE, Microsoft reverse-engineered and re-implemented parsing bugs Netscape didn't even know they had, and later Mozilla had to do a lot of the same work on IE's behaviour). This is a good part of the reason that there's only four reasonably useful HTML rendering engines on a planet of six billion people.<p>One of the goals of HTML5 is to reverse-engineer and document what it is that browsers actually do to turn tag-soup into an internally consistent DOM tree, in the hope that future browser vendors won't have to reverse-engineer the wheel yet again. For example, "".innerHTML"" is a property on DOM elements that allows script to quickly change the content of that element. It's widely used on websites, and supported in all major HTML engines, so you'd think it'd be pretty easy to get right and interoperable, right? Wrong:<p><pre><code>    http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1158969783&count=1
</code></pre>
How about the property ""document.title"", which should just reflect the content of the title element?<p><pre><code>    http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1161121410&count=1
</code></pre>
In short, yes - I think formally specifying browser behaviour in the face of the existing web is a truly noble and useful goal, especially if it helps increase competition in the field of useful HTML renderers, and it falls under the auspices of the HTML specification because what other specification will tell a browser vendor how to understand and display the existing corpus of HTML documents?",1250692833

He agrees to pay you $1,000 regardless of whether his business succeeds or fails. To motivate you to put in more time and effort he agrees to pay you a <i>bonus</i> of %5 of the profits should his business double within the first year of your work completing.<p>Because of this percentage enticement you put in way more time and effort than you normally would for $1,000. However, his business fails completely and bankrupts him, despite your efforts. You don't get a bonus.<p>Now a reasonable person would understand that this is the risk you took with your time and effort. That you were only <i>guaranteed</i> $1,000. Any extra effort you put in was essentially an investment.<p>Let's say though that your friend convinced his neighboors that his business was essential to their well being and took up donations. Now instead of laying low and working hard to get his business back on track and <i>pay off</i> his neighboors, he start throwing bonus money around, most likely because he is also compensated via bonus money as president of his business.<p>This seriously works for you?",1250692302

Fuzzy reasons include a certain enjoyment of the physical artifact, and the fact that it encourages me, every so often, to listen to an album straight through, something I rarely do with digital media.<p>Mainly, though, I resent paying the same or more for digital downloads - CDs are a physical artifact, so digital stuff ought to be cheaper.

Some online books show how to implement a simple ""Prolog"" engine in Lisp. They typically rely on a representation of Prolog programs that is convenient from a Lisp perspective, and can't even parse a single proper Prolog term. With this approach, implementing a simple ""Lisp"" in Prolog is even easier (""Lisp in Prolog in zero lines""): Translate each Lisp function to a Prolog predicate with one additional argument to hold the original function's return value. Done. This is possible since a function is a special case of a relation, and functional programming is a restricted form of logic programming.

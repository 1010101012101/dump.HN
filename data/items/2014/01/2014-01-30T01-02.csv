7148617,comment,7146560,7147001,1,0,204NoContent,,,"Thanks for the link to the blog post.  It raised an important point worthy of inspection.  I ran some numbers and &quot;peeking&quot; after the first 1000 trials does change the outcome.  The chance that the outcome will reverse from declaring branch A the winner with 95% confidence to declaring branch B the winner with 95% confidence is rather small, less than 10%.  However, if you lower your requirements to 80% confidence then the chance of the winner swapping increases to over 50%! For reference, I used the Wilson approximation for binomial distributions.  I&#x27;m sure the Wald approximation fares worse.",1391047190

7148613,comment,7148216,7148216,3,0,zacinbusiness,,,"I believe the idea that these technologies is alienating is false. There are some people (such as myself) who simply do not wish to engage with their fellow passengers on a train or airplane. So, if someone politely speaks to me then I am forced to either a: engage with them (there&#x27;s no harm in doing so, but I simply don&#x27;t want to), or b: come up with some sort of way out of the conversation and hope to not appear rude (I don&#x27;t wish to offend anyone, but I just don&#x27;t want to talk to them). However, people are much less likely to speak to me if I&#x27;m wearing headphones or if I&#x27;m reading something on my phone, laptop, or tablet.<p>However, I also disagree here that Google Glass will stop being dorky, and I really think that it will be a while before it goes &quot;mainstream.&quot; The reason is that people were somewhat hostile when the iPad was first released. Indeed, many people still look at tablet users as smug and see them as somehow offensive. So, as has been said here, now you&#x27;re making the tablet very tiny, very expensive, and adding a nearly always-on camera to it.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;d like to point out bluetooth ear pieces. You simply look like a smug bastard or an idiot when you&#x27;re using one (full disclosure, I used to have one during college so that I could listen to music while riding my bike to class, but also keep an ear open for traffic etc.) And Google Glass is really not that much different from a bluetooth ear piece, except, again, that it&#x27;s got a little screen and a nearly always-on camera.",1391047139

Thus if they want to increase premiums, and therefore profits, the only way to do it is to increase the cost of care.  Preferably, they increase the cost of care for everyone, which drives more people to buy insurance, and means that some other company isn&#x27;t able to undercut them on premiums by reducing costs. Of course, they als  get more float, which insurance companies love. That is the model that health care insurance companies follow, and ObamaCare was a huge gift to helping them out.",1391046710

If you can get a job, you will get a job in the Bay Are at some crummy startup.<p>2) They don&#x27;t count people who aren&#x27;t looking for employment afterwards.

Bring API Keys<p>So many times I&#x27;ve wanted to use a vendor&#x27;s API but have been held back because it&#x27;s a Friday night and I need to have an account vetted by a CSR before I can get an API key (looking at you AT&T). This is nonsensical. If you have a vetting process, I suggest that you create say 5-10 hackathon specific accounts and have the necessary login/API keys to send to competitors. Then rekey/reset the passwords on the account for the next event. You will be loved for the ease of setup and if the project becomes something bigger than a weekend deal, I&#x27;m sure teams will have no problem going through the setup process.<p>12. Don&#x27;t corrupt the event<p>I stay away from events with large prizes[1] because there&#x27;s no way to win unless you use the most APIs/products that the main sponsor(s) have provided. Most of the events I&#x27;ve been to have reasonable prizes and it&#x27;s hard to argue that the most technically excellent project didn&#x27;t win. Also at those events, if someone doesn&#x27;t meet the criteria for the award, it goes unclaimed, as it should be. With large prizes 1st place always seems to be a team that gave a 5 minute long commercial for Sponsor X, Y & Z even if the implementation is poor and/or mostly a Powerpoint. The overall competition is harmed as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>(I&#x27;m not going to mention names because most of these sponsors are otherwise good Hackathon citizens I support)<p>Probably the worst example of this was an event I went to with a large prize (10-15K or so) and a film crew on set led by a former G4 TV host. It was apparently some sort of Hackathon Reality Show. Well, in the sprit of &quot;Reality&quot; TV the team they were mostly following, containing some of the main sponsor&#x27;s employees and some photogenic business types, won (surprise!).<p>The second worst example was an event with a 20K grand prize which was won by a 12 and 9 year old duo along with a (presumably sponsor provided) professional artist and member of the event staff. Their submission was basically a concept with a lot of nice pictures, a well rehearsed speech, and two very adorable kids. It made the rounds on the usual tech sites and probably was worth every penny the sponsor may or may not have paid. The sponsor also had some corporate rep to help keep the hackathon &quot;on brand.&quot; I hadn&#x27;t seen her at the sponsor&#x27;s past events and she made some ugly faces at me when I was mentioned I use a competitor&#x27;s API because the sponsor violated Rule #11.<p>[1] Typically the events I&#x27;ve been to have had 1st place prizes between $0-$2000 and $20,000+ with little in between. I typically look at a :large prize&quot; as being in the former category.",1391046162

Defense in depth.  A firewall that supports a VPN that runs on your office&#x27;s laptops is very handy for working from home or the road.<p>We have a Watchguard Firebox firewall.  It works well but is very annoying to configure: the primary configuration mechanism is a Windows program, but I run linux, so that just pisses me off.  The secondary mechanism is a web page running Flash (I dislike flash).  The configuration is a very leaky abstraction, with further pisses me off.<p>* For the switch(es), you definitely want a &quot;small business&quot; managed switch ($500 and up) that supports RMON/SNMP. (We have some old Linksys/Cisco &quot;managed&quot; switches with no RMON - cannot tell me where my traffic is going - and can only be configured with IE 7 or older(!!!)  POSes!!!).<p>* For wireless, I installed the Ubiquity UniFi wireless access points (threw away some older Cisco WAPs that were POSes).  If you only have one AP, this is overkill... we have several of them to cover our facility.  The system is very reasonable and the central management is very very convenient.  The primary interface to the software is Flash (ugh) - but it works well enough.  There are other ways of interacting with the controller, but I have not much that way (I have written some MongoDB scripts to extract useful information nightly).<p>* You are also going to need DHCP, DNS, etc.  Windows Server with Active Directory is dominant at businesses.  Linux and OSX interoperate fairly well with AD.  LDAP (and Kerberos if you want single-sign-in) would be the alternative to AD.  Being a linuxhead, I would run a Debian/Ubuntu server with bind (DNS) and isc-dhcp-server (DHCP) - that is what I&#x27;m running at home and it works well.  You will probably (eventually) want to run Icinga/Nagios/equivalent and Cacti/equivalent to monitor your systems on this server as well.<p>* I assume your SIP phones will be using a SAAS outside company PBX.  I don&#x27;t have experience with that, we have an on-site PBX (predates me, and is now obsolete).",1391045317

It&#x27;s also relatively new. There is no natural language input. There are no non-mathematical capabilities. The syntax should match Python syntax for the most part, though there are extensions to allow things like &quot;sin x&quot; or &quot;x^2&quot; or &quot;2 x&quot;. All this will hopefully improve in the future (and pull requests are welcome!).<p>Most of the code was written by David Li (who is actually a high school student). You can watch a presentation about it here: <a href=""http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/presentation_detail.php?id=183"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/presentation_detail.ph...</a>. It started out as a &quot;because we can&quot; toy, and it&#x27;s gotten much better.<p>The real benefit of SymPy Gamma over WolframAlpha is that there are no barriers around it, since it&#x27;s entirely (BSD) open source. For example, if you start computing something interesting and want to try more, you can move to SymPy Live (<a href=""http://live.sympy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://live.sympy.org/</a>) and compute in a more session like environment. Or you can use SymPy locally on your own computer.<p>Regarding the comments that wolfram is mostly used for play, I&#x27;m not so sure about it. Wolfram is invaluable to students as a calculator. Sure Google can compute 100 * pi, but it falls apart when you try to compute integrate(sin(x) * x, x). When I was in college (which was last year), I saw people use it all the time. It&#x27;s been very successful in making computer algebra accessible to virtually everyone.<p>By the way, probably the best feature of SymPy Gamma right now is the integration steps. See for instance the &quot;integral steps&quot; section of <a href=""http://www.sympygamma.com/input/?i=integrate%28sin%28x%29*x%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sympygamma.com/input/?i=integrate%28sin%28x%29*x%...</a>. This is a feature that used to be free at WolframAlpha, and it&#x27;s extremely useful if you are learning integration in calculus. It doesn&#x27;t work for all integrals, because not all integrals are computed the way you would by hand.",1391043726

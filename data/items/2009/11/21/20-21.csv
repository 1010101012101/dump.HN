When I'm having an actual conversation, it usually means that I'm already interested in the topic and I don't mind asking someone to clarify / repeat if I don't understand them. It doesn't matter if I don't like someone's accent at that point (and I will try really hard to actually guess / understand the sentence). However, if someone wants to sell me something over the phone, or is there to provide me a service I paid for - I sometimes do that (i.e. say that I can't understand what they're trying to sell and hangup, or ask to speak to someone with better accent to avoid a misunderstanding).",1258836863

Essentially it escapes a bunch of strings, like <script> tags.<p>Sanitization like this is common to sites which allow UGC, with the onus being on the programmer to perform the sanitization. Unfortunately, a lot of popular UGC sites either attempt no sanitization, or screw it up  (e.g., Twitter, MySpace). Thus, IE8 attempts basic sanitization of all pages automatically, unless a header is sent telling it not to. In theory, this should provide basic protection for the user when the site's developers drop the ball.<p>Long story short, there is an error in their sanitization routine. Thus, an attacker can pass a seemingly harmless string (which would not be filtered by the application's own security), which is then escaped by IE8, producing malicious output.<p>This type of bug is somewhat common, but since many dev's are rolling their own sanitization routines (bad idea [1]), the exposure is usually limited to one site. But because IE8's filter runs on all sites, any site which contains the malicious string is affected. Given the huge number of sites that allow some kind of UGC, this is a huge problem.<p>Reddit's recent worm is somewhat analogous, in that its a case of a well-intentioned sanitization method being exploited.

I linked above to a million dollar pot.<p>> What I meant is the poker rooms have more to lose by getting caught being dishonest than they have to gain by skimming some profits.<p>I wish it were that easy. A recent example is Microgaming. 20 skins of that network (a network still going today with sites like ladbrokes, 32bet are part of) went down, and took with it 5 million dollars of deposits. Players weren't refunded; microgaming did not honour those deposits.<p>>>> There has been a few cases where employees were found to be using exploits to cheat. In these cases its usually players finding unusual patterns in their play and calling them out on it that has lead to them being caught.<p>In the UltimateBet cheating scandal, it is assumed the vast majority of funds stolen from players was not returned. No one involved was caught. A man strongly connected with the cheating at UB was one of the 12 named by the DoJ as an owner of UB/AP.",1302944316

Anyone who knows what that means, they would've known that RIM and Nokia will be in trouble ever since the first iPhone came out.<p>But specifically, RIM is in trouble because either they didn't see the industry change towards touchscreen devices fast enough, or they didn't care until recently. Why wouldn't they care? Because until recently their financials were reaching records after records, and they thought that's the only metric for the company's future success. ""Hey, why would we ever change when we're making so much money with out old ways?"". The problem is disruptive innovations and market shifts like these are very misleading for incumbents. The disruptive products don't start hurting the incumbent's financials until it's already too late to change.

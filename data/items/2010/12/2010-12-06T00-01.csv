I bought it in 2007.<p>I push the machine pretty hard, with ten to fifteen applications running, tons of tabs open for my web browsing along with multiple user accounts simultaneously logged in which I switch between.<p>The whole machine is sluggish and I often have to wait seconds for things to happen.  Nothing is snappy any more.<p>The main problem is that Firefox is constantly bumping up towards 100% CPU and chewing huge amounts of RAM - around 1.5 gig.<p>So I decided that its time for a new machine - a new Macbook Pro with 8 gig RAM and a 256gig SSD.  I specced it all out on the Apple store and the price - ouch - was close to AUD$4,558.  Whatever I thought - it's my main work machine, I really need something that's fast enough to get my daily work done without grinding and chugging.<p>In the meantime I decided to switch to Google Chrome which I had been using a bit on the side for a while and it seemed pretty quick.  So I totally switched to Chrome for OSX and shut down Firefox for the last time.<p>Suddenly - a snappy machine again!  Even with large numbers of tabs open my web browsing is fast.  Even better, CPU utilisation is generally low (often under 5%) and RAM is usage low too (often under 150MB).<p>I've got my fast machine back!  Everything is working better, everything is more snappy.  Applications switch fast, web browsing is snappy, and everything just works.<p>I feel a bit sad about leaving Firefox behind - I want to support it and I've used it for years.  I don't want to speak ill of this old friend.<p>So the incentive to buy a new machine has gone.  My 2007 vintage Macbook Pro is still doing the job well.  I'm sure I'll need a new machine sometime soon but right my 2007 era Macbook Pro does everything I need, at a good snappy pace. Thanks Google Chrome!",1291596850

If you plan it right, you can have 1 baby a month with a 9 month delay, but again that's 8 months too late for a deadline.<p>The saying here is essentially akin to too many cooks spoil the broth. Put it this way: 1 brick layer can lay 9ft of brick in 9 days (no factuality here). If you're building a wall you can only go one row at a time. 2/3 brick layers will speed up the process. However 9 brick layers won't produce a 9ft tall brick wall in 9 days because 6 brick layers will be sat on their arses drinking coffee.<p>9 brick layers can produce 9 9ft walls in 9 days, but won't be producing a 9ft wall in a day 9 days continuously <i>working as a team</i>.<p>The statement doesn't preclude that work can be produced efficiently, for example you could easily have 4 brick layers build 4 9ft walls - AKA a house - in 9 days.<p>The aim is to find your fundamental limit and work with it. If you need a baby every month, sure plan ahead and you could have a baby monthly starting in 9 months, if you can account for that 9 month waiting period. You will never get a baby in 1 month with a team of 9 women and only 1 of them being pregnant.",1291596474

The same thing is happening in the education field.<p>Doctors perhaps need to start specializing more in areas where it is harder for technology to reach.  Maybe they need to think more holistically (something difficult for computers to do).  Perhaps they need to actually learn about people in intricate detail - about their diet, habits, health history, etc. prior to diagnosing.  Perhaps they need to become strictly health advisors, or partners of health.  Maybe they should perform weekly/monthly/yearly meetings with individuals, learning about them over time through spending time with them.  Decisions would be truly informed and they would develop true care for the person (and quality as a result).<p>In addition, it's important that doctors stop being viewed as creatures with omnipotent and infallible knowledge and decision making powers (I know there are exceptions to this but I believe it's true for a lot of people).",1291595476

For instance there are subjects where I probably could never become a researcher, because I just don't for some reason come up with new ideas in those subjects, but I can understand the new ideas others come up. Hence, I could potentially be a decent reviewer in those subjects.<p>What could work would be a system where we have reviewer as a separate profession. Researchers submit papers to reviewers who review them and give feedback, and an overall rating which is digitally signed. When a paper is published (by whatever means--open access journal, the researcher's blog, whatever), the signed reviewer ratings can also be included.<p>Over time, reviewers would develop reputations with readers, and researchers would hire high reputation reviewers to review their papers, allowing the good reviewers to make reviewing their full time job.<p>When someone posts an unreviewed paper at arXiv.org, I'd expect that reviewers who have not built up reputations would review it for free, and publish their reviews. I'd expect sites would spring up specifically to host these reviews. It would be through these sites that new reviewers would built up their reputations to where researchers will start to pay them to get reviews.",1291595275

1973204,comment,1971942,1972551,0,0,jdcrunchman,,," Agreed, not only have a not too long periods of unemployment, I cannot be employed in my current condition, let alone the fact that I'm a convicted felon in the eyes of the credit companies, and databases. I was quoted at $12,000 to fix my records and get them straight.  So head hunters who access this database will see that I am falsely stated as a convicted felon. When in actuality during my initial court hearings on my past crimes, it is stipulated that after successfully completing probation, my felon would be expunged. Unfortunately, the databases like Equifax  and others, have me mistakenly put down  as a felon.",1291593990

Some places shake deliberately to get the froth as Manhattans tend to have a signature twist in posher places. I think you're right to ask to stir instead for a classic Manhattan (especially if you're using Canadian Club or Crown Royal).",1291593775

Strictly speaking, if two databases differ only in their level of normalisation, then they will store the same information, just in different places. When you update the denormalised version, you will have to update the same values in multiple places.<p>If you don't want to update that value everywhere, then what you have isn't denormalisation, it is actually a different data model, which stores different information. Since you wouldn't be able to get to the ""normalised"" version you describe without losing information, it is probably wrong to call it ""denormalised"" in the first place.",1291593673

Google had an early advantage in the cloud game with their internal infrastructure.  Google devs could produce apps on a platform not available to the rest of the world.  As publicly available tools mature to the same level, anyone will be able to produce the same kind of robust, infinitely-scalable cloud apps.

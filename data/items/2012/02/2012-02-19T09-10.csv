I moved my first software company (now defunct) to Reno, NV from California in 2002, in what seemed like an unmitigated financial success.

What I failed to factor in was the profoundly depressing nature of every day seeing senior citizens in wheelchairs with oxygen tanks robotically pulling levers on slot machines or feeding money into video poker. Even if you avoid the casinos, you see it at the gas station, supermarket, etc...

I personally would always choose the chocolate cake, no matter how much time I had to spend on the decision - I just <i>don't like</i> fruit salads, at least not as much as cakes. And one doesn't eat desserts all the time, so it's not much of a problem anyway. 'Optimal' != 'healthy', and I bet (pun intended) that when choosing dessert many people optimize for feeling, not for health.<p>(Maybe this effect was documented using some other experiments, but sometimes when I read psychology stuff, I start do doubt both my and researchers' sanity, because I can't figure out how little shifts of behavior over e.g. a chocolate cake, tested on a small (< 1k) sample are really giving us any valuable insight, and are not just random noise)",1329644244

Selling (or buying) hardware was never the whole point of an Apple, just the one with higher margins.<p><i>I believe that about 80% of their income now comes from non-computer products - with an emphasis on entertainment.</i><p>And I believe that if you call the iPhone or the iPad an ""entertainment"" device, you are missing like 80% of the big picture.

For quite some time there was no option to run Windows on an Intel Mac.<p><i>Bootcamp allowed Apple to sell into the PC space - without which they would not have been able to overshadow Microsoft.</i><p>They haven't ""overshadowed"" Microsoft. Apple's share went from 5% to 10-12%. Microsoft still have 7-8 times that much.<p>And, since Mac's share was in an upwards trend (from 2% when Jobs come aboard), even before the switch to Intel, no one can say how much this switch influenced the market share increase.<p>Where Apple DID overshadow MS is in the media player, phone and tablet space.

I just didnt really know where to begin...The APIs might have been documented, but it wasnt clear how to piece things together to make something useful.""</i><p>I haven't had this problem myself. To me, piecing together different libraries in Node feels much the same as it does in any other language. You find the libraries via Google, you learn the APIs, and you write glue code to hook them in to your business logic. I'm not sure what would make Node at all different in this respect.<p><i>""The async-style of programming is almost entirely inaccessible to my brain.""</i><p>I'm guessing you're referring to the mess of ultra-deep, nested callbacks that plagues many Node apps. If you just keep nesting callback after callback, then yes, your code will be ugly and unmaintainable. But there are solutions to this. Look into control flow libraries like Step.<p><i>""So what exactly is your excuse for choosing Node.JS as your backend platform?""</i><p>Here's my main reason. When building for the web, Node can sometimes be far more maintainable than many other platforms. That's because you can share code between client and server. Admittedly, the community hasn't yet settled on a best practice for implementing client-server code sharing. But folks have found ways to do it that work, and you can just pick one that feels good. Sharing code is a big maintainability improvement if you have a thick client that knows a lot about business logic.",1347177580

Hasen, when you opined ""Node.js is a terrible platform"", I thought you would also say something about the bad decisions we make because of it. This is how I made mine:<p>Day 1: Let's Node.js because everyone is doing it. In that context, no-sql databases gel very well with it, so let's do that.<p>Day 3: Whoaa! Prototype is already done. Great<p>Day 4: My databases entities are so thin, sql databases are so overrated. I don't need sql.<p>Day 6: Uh-Oh, I did not think of that database entity. Oh no, look, it has a relationship too.<p>Day 7: Frack, the no-sql CRUD operations code is damn mess.<p>Day 8: More relationships! ""If I only had used sql"". Sighs. Oh wait, look a node.js-mysql library. (Code Hustle). No no, it is still a mess. Well, it is still working so let's have a little patience.<p>Day 15: Why my code looks like a puke?<p>Day 20: Ok, I/O code is now like 7-8% of my complete project. Why did I go for Node.js again? This doesn't make sense. I am going on a vacation.<p>Day 27: First thing back from vacation, farewell Node.js. Let's go for Flask(python) + SqlAlchemy(oh I missed you so much) + Gunicorn + Gevent + Juggernaut(for websocket.Node.js, you found your rightful place).<p>I think the reason for such hype around Node.js is due to the rise of a new class of startups which are born with a ""fail-fast"" mentality. Node.js does help you to fail fast. But I think that it is a pessimistic view of idea and software development. Agreed that node.js removes the initial inertia to implement an idea, but I think that this is it's greatest failure. A little inertia can be good. It forces you to sit down and think hard about the architecture and the idea itself. It's same as a small group of lean mean soldiers can extract a defended fort from the enemy, but holding the fort would take a lot of strategic thinking, resources and more soldiers. I think it's time to get a bit optimistic about our own ability to do that. Well, unless, you never wanted to hold the fort. In that case, everything is just fine.",1347177492

While there is some overlap, I find each platform to have merit.<p>* I like Java for projects that I know are going to become big and complicated.  When you have thousands of classes and multiple people working in a codebase, static typing is a godsend.  I don't care if it involves a little more typing.  As an added bonus, the JVM performs great.<p>* I like Node.js for small projects, especially ones with large concurrency needs.  I recently did a project that involved being able to aggregate repeated barrages of several thousand requests with a finite deadline of a couple seconds.  Node.js handled twice the throughput of Twisted or Tornado, and was considerably more stable.  Gevent and coroutines would have been even slower.<p>* I like Python for stuff ""in between"".  Rich libraries, blocking i/o, exceptions, and proper stacktraces.  Even has halfway-decent IDE support (PyDev).  Execution is slow by JVM standards but Python makes a great swiss army knife.<p>There's no perfect platform for all situations.  Use the right tool for the right job - sometimes that's Node.js.

That being, 95% of the things you'd want to build on the web.<p>My take on Node is that it's what you use when you want to build an Etherpad.  If your app will have 1000 people messing with one thing at once, with all their interactions propagating out everywhere instantly, you're going to want to use Node.  If you're building a mmorpg-in-a-browser, you'll probably find Node will be a good fit.<p>If you're building a CRUD app, however, Node is likely the worst choice you can make in terms of productivity lost versus advantage gained.  I mean sure you'll pull it off.  But the kid who wrote the same thing in Rails will be on his third failed startup by the time you get your MVP launched.<p>There's probably a balance that you can strike for apps that ""sorta"" need Nodeishness.  Use a standard, non-insanity-inducing stack for the bulk of the site, then keep a Node instance off in the corner to run the ""App"" bit that needs the realtime communication.<p>I think this message got lost somewhere along the way, and now we're seeing a lot of frustration from people using this cool, specific, technology for stuff that it's just plain not suited for.",1347177219

The author bravely admits, ""The async-style of programming is almost entirely inaccessible to my brain."" There comes a point on the road to being a great coder where you can no longer really approach it as a craft; the theory and philosophy start to matter. A common plateau is the point where it becomes necessary to see the commonality between essentially the same computation being driven by different control approaches. I've seen many a competent procedural programmer be unable to write their first GUI app because they can't adjust to an event driven model or unable to make the most of SQL because of its semi-declarative nature.

4495237,comment,4495101,4495101,19,0,tikhonj,,,"I think that a much better alternative to Node than Python or Go is Haskell. Why? Well, for one, it makes writing asynchronous code very easy--you essentially get it for free. Haskell web servers perform very well while keeping the code readable.<p>However, ignoring performance, there are also all of Haskell's other advantages. The type system is great--you can do stuff like ensuring links within your app work using the type system. Haskell is also very good at embedding DSLs, which can make writing web-specific code much nicer. In my experience, Haskell code tends to be more concise and declarative than Go or Python, making it easier to read. And, crucially, you can program at a higher level of abstraction which makes it both easier to write and maintain relatively complicated code.<p>Now, admittedly, going from almost any other language to Haskell is quite a shift. For most programmers, learning Haskell will take a bit longer than learning yet another imperative language (e.g. Go). However, I think this is well worth it, and web apps are a particularly convenient field for it.<p>This[1] StackOverflow question and an associated paper[2] are very interesting to read about how a Haskell web server could work and have good performance.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3847108/what-is-the-haskell-response-to-node-js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3847108/what-is-the-haske...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/web-server-jfp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/web-server-jfp...</a><p>It would also be useful to look at a Haskell web framework like Yesod[3], Snap[4] or Happstack[5].

There are many recorded incidents of interference. The WSJ call these ""anecdotal evidence"" but they happened, and they were documented by the FAA.<p>Just think for a second about the term ""anecdotal evidence.""  What really is the problem with ""anecdotal evidence?"" Well the term is an example of a logical fallacy only when one seeks to deduce broad all encompassing conclusions from such evidence. Thus, for example, if you see one drunken irish person it does not follow that irish are drunks. It is anecdotal evidence. But does the same logic follow for plane crashes? I suppose if you have one recorded event of a device interfering with flight instrumentation, you could call that ""anecdotal evidence."" But what if the plane crashes and it kills 300 people? Well that would still be a rare occurrance, and you could still call this an anecdote. But it would also be a terrible tragedy.<p>You see, rare occurrences are not sufficient to create an overall rule about the majority of cases, but they are sufficient to create tragedies. I am willing to bet that even most drunk drivers end up getting home safely. Then why ban drunk driving? Because the danger of death even if relatively rare is still unacceptable. Because we value life in this country. So my point is that the usual rule against anecdotal evidence does not apply when dealing with airline safety. In airline safety even things that happen very rarely can be a problem. Because, again, we value our lives.<p>Their other point is also rather dumb. They say that they did a survey that showed that many people do not turn off their devices completely and few people (2%) even use them blatantly. The thinking here goes a little bit like this: ""since some people broke the rules and no disaster happened then it must be ok for more people to break the rule"". This is train of logic is similar to the one used in the Peter Principle. This kind of thinking is basically guaranteed to result in a disaster. Because, every time they would say ""well nothing bad has happened thus far, so we might as well increase the sources interference"", and this will go on until something bad happens.",1347174083

Whether it will become or would like to become a ""superpower"" is not clear.<p>But yes I don't think Mandarin is a good candidate for a global language. It is probably the most difficult language on this planet. Seriously, even the Chinese themseleves have trouble with it. I am Chinese and the last time I wrote long paragraphs of Chinese characters was at the College Extrance Exam (and whenever I mention this to friends everyone agrees). So if you ask me to write some less commonly used words I can only tell you I forgot - I have seen this happen many times to everyone. And the idioms - very hard for westerners without learning all the Classics and History, which are in Classical Chinese - think about Latin.<p>Chinese is beautiful though. Personally I think we probably have the most exquisite poems - the ancient Chinese spent more times on them than any other art forms or scientific researches. It was the highest among the high arts.",1347174081

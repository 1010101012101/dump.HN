There are quite a few of those floating around, but they have a reputation for being poor quality, esp. with kerning and such, depending on how quick the tracing/repackaging job was.

It's a 12-week course and the first round is just about over now. I tested the idea by doing a 3-hour teleconference call and selling tickets for $100 to start with, and the main feedback customers gave me was ""MORE!"" Then I... you guessed it... saved the money. (This one is just me and a friend, not with my husband.)<p>If things got bad, I would take on more consulting work, bust ass, and save again. Although I don't think I'll ever have to do that again, given the success of my or our various infoproducts/classes/training courses.<p>It's simple: I refuse to do anything but bootstrap. I will never take a penny in venture capital. I will never let the outside demands of another person screw with my career again.<p>I am also fully committed to doing whatever it takes to succeed, and that means being my own angel.<p>So when I decided those things, I sat my ass down and did my best to figure out how I could get money, fast, and with the least amount of effort.<p>I certainly won't fail because I believe, on some level, that there is something so special about me that I deserve to be able to work on just one thing and have my bills taken care of.<p>Enough information for you?<p>EDIT: By the way -- yes, I'm not doing it alone (and my husband is no slacker in the code department), but it's my grand plan.

Having concerns about being motivated to work is one thing, but describing the rest of your life with words like ""sucked into"", ""suffer"", ""frustrated"", ""compulsive"", ""sociophobic"" sounds like you have a generally negative attitude that's separate from your desire to be productive.  Maybe that's just because you feel like you're in a crisis, but maybe consider trying to look at things more positively.  I think that issue is separate from deciding what to do next in your career.<p>Add some exercise to your daily routine.  It'll help with lots of things, physical and mental.<p>It's fine to be an introvert, but don't use it as an excuse not to go out and meet people.

I call this the ""fallacy of control"" ...<p>Basically, don't forget who controls the product/service/platform you're trying to build for or sell.  The prime example of this is Pandora's epic journey through the annals of the music industry.  Brilliant idea, brilliant execution, but almost didn't make it because they didn't actually have any control over the product they were selling (other peoples' music).<p>I've seen lots of companies start and fail trying to do similar things -- music, movies, TV shows, etc.  So many ideas can be so simple ... ""we'll create this awesome service that lets you pick your song and XYZ""<p>Or, more simply put:  Be in control of your own supply chain.",1277150518

So, might as well get it out of the way:<p>Figure out what you like doing, and find ways to spend more time doing that.<p>Ok, that said... in real-life, sometimes we have conflicting desires and tradeoffs have to be made.  If I like doing ""X"" and ""B"" but ""B"" pays way better, and I also want ""Y"" which requires money, then maybe ""B"" is the better choice, even if I actually like ""X"" a little more. Or not.  The point is, there are no perfect decisions... life is a series of trade-offs, learning experiences and opportunities to re-evaluate things.  If I have any useful advise to give, I'd say something like:<p>1. Above all, stay true to yourself vis-a-vis principles and values.  Don't compromise on who you are or what you believe in, just to make a buck or whatever.<p>2. Try to avoid decisions that lock you too firmly onto one path.  While it's true - after a fashion - that it's ""never too late to $FOO"", inertia and lock-in are powerful forces.  Sometimes you have to pick, jobs, locations to live, significant others, etc., but try to always keep an eye towards keeping your options open.<p>3. All of that said, read ""Hero With A Thousand Faces"" by Joseph Campbell.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces</a>  Watch the movie ""Vision Quest""  Think about what you want your purpose, your quest, your defining goal to be.  Pursue it whole-heartedly.  Watch that old Kevin Costner movie ""Tin Cup"" as well.  It's silly, but there's some great wisdom there.<p>4. Realize that the old saw about ""Winners never quit and Quitters never win"" is true but represents a double-edged sword of sorts.  Read ""Moby Dick"" and imagine Captain Ahab muttering to himself ""Winners never quit, winners never quit...""  There's a fine line between determination and obsession.  Unfortunately you might not recognize it until you cross it.  Some lessons you just have to learn through experience.<p>5. On the sexual frustration thing...  I'm hesitant to say this, because it can open a big can of worms for some people and lead to more obsession, but...  If you're not good at connecting with women, there <i>is</i> useful knowledge to be found in the ""PUA community"" (or ""Seduction Community"" if you like).  There's a lot of BS as well, but some people do gain from getting involved in that.  <a href=""http://www.fastseduction.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastseduction.com</a>",1277150488

As long as you're looking for ""original and heterodox"" ideas in the field of Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) criticism, an example I did not make up, you might as well be nice about it.

1449876,comment,1449467,1449467,0,0,kiba,,,"Well, my perspective would say that the system is corrupted(Fractional reserve banking a fraud, etc). Regulators sleeping at the wheels are probably in bed with the bankers. The hubris of the federal regulatory system and the people who manages it, thinks that they can manage the economy yet at the same time be non-corrupt. Then there are the big hubris of corporations that thinks  they can manages risks with mathematical models and financial engineers.<p>Many of the same ideas is said in the article.<p>However, I propose a different, radical solution. Get rid of the banking regulatory framework, stop bailing out corporations, and get rid of legal tender law. Do nothing. Let the big guys fall. Let the economy readjust themselves to the fact of reality.<p>At this point in our economic development history, the interventions were so vast and deep that we don't know which way is up and which way is down. Democratic governments have produced thousands of new laws that complicated business dealing. Then lobbyists can sneak some laws in that prop up industries. When an intervention does goes wrong, another intervention is put in place to solve it. If there is an urgent social problem, the solution is to make new laws to solve it.<p>Wouldn't life be better with a few simple business laws that everyone can understand and follow?<p>Yet, those government people and their special groups managed to mess it up by padding taxation code, punishment for firing union workers, and punishment for alleged racial discrimination.<p>The more complicated a system of rules is, the more potential for corruptions, opportunities for conflict of interests, and regulators getting away not doing their job.(Hence the saying, ""when a law is made, the first thing that will be brought is the law."")<p>I don't think the solution is more democracy. Voters are not really rational, nor will they have much interest in defending themselves from the myriad of special interest groups that permeates and compete in the democratic institution. Political and economic education is hard when you have million of citizens worrying about their own lives and competition within their section. Now they have to worry about what the local government, the state government, and the federal government is doing with these mega-corporations. Then they got to worry about the local regulators with their code, and finally have to face an IRS audit every once in a while. At that point, it become rational to become ignorant because of the cost of educating oneself is higher than the potential benefit would provide.<p>Is there a solution? I don't know. But I am content to let the system fall apart since political will is not going to acknowledge the reality about the many deficiency in economic policies(Which cause mass distortion of incentives in market actors), and the system of perverse incentive that exists within the government itself.<p>However, I am pretty excited about emerging technologies and the effort of libertarians to look for non-political means to solutions, especially the ""anti-capitalistic free marketeers"" varieties.(No, it does not involve warfare, or election of officials, and you don't have to worry about rioting)<p>I would say it involves a lot of makerbots, creativity, entrepreneurship. It is building a better economic foundation that isn't found on lot of debts, lies, and kickback. From there we can build a new framework of rules that's very strong on the basic. A framework that doesn't suffer from the mass confusions of laws added every years. Eventually, an alternative society would emerge out of a network of entrepreneurs, their connection with  the community, and their customers. That alternative society would co-exists side by side and seamlessly with the other society at large.<p>But it requires a lot of stratagems and making a right of exits unknown or seemly nonthreatening to officials. It's a difficult problem to solve.<p>On the other hand, we could try to found a new country on the ocean sea, which is known as seasteading. It is probably a pipe dream, but the seasteading movement got some very realistic and pragmatic people. These individuals look for economic efficiency and business models in their seastead. They aren't try to build huge utopias complete with casino, strip club, and all the extravagances.<p>Again, seasteading and new countries are seen as a threat. Countries get nervous when there is a new neighbor on the scene. They will try to destroy the threat. It will require a brilliant amount of political stratagems and common sense on the behalf of the seasteaders to fend off nervous nation-states.<p>If the seasteading movement succeeded, no longer will we be restricted to an industry of 200 governments, many of them are not any good, and the best is mediocre at most. There would be a thousand governments, and that mean real competition. Terrestrial government now have to improve services and efficiency or face mass migration from their citizens to thousand of little nations on the high sea. We might not even need that many, as evidenced with the appearance of Firefox, opening up and intensifying the competition in the browser market.<p>Anyway, enough talking for me. The solutions if anything, is probably going to be hard to implement. It's probably deceptively simple. It will probably make the population mad. It might be something completely unexpected, even to me. But there is one thing that I am pretty sure, democracies doesn't work.<p>(Sorry for the wall of texts)",1277150453

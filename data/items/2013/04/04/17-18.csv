It presented you with a grid of icons to choose from before you could interact with content. The switch to news feed first worked well there and I don't see why the same logic shouldn't work with the entire phone just as well.<p>Though seeing as facebook is only a small subset of my sources of interesting information, I could see this bringing to the table competing home screen 'apps' that incorporate more from your world than just the apps that facebook own.",1365098374

I don't disagree with your representation of the law (or the practice of the FBI) as it applies to traditional telecommunications carriers. They're clearly covered by CALEA.<p>But Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are simply not telecommunications carriers. That's the whole point. CALEA as enacted in 1994 doesn't apply to them, and even the FCC didn't try to apply CALEA to them when subsequently expanding the law. This is why both the FBI director and the FBI general counsel said in the last two weeks they want Congress to rewrite the law to cover those companies.<p>CALEA applies to ""facilities-based broadband Internet \naccess providers and providers of interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)."" Pure TCP/IP services are not ""interconnected.""

The reality is any company bigger than startup size is going to be using lots of different technologies for lots of different things, for a variety of reasons.

The way doctors and nurses talked about it, you'd think there were conclusive studies showing major impacts from even low levels of caffeine and alcohol consumption, and not breastfeeding for up to a year.<p>I think the breastfeeding debate is a great example. The studies showing any non-trivial advantages are tenuous, and often fail to detect any statistically significant advantage at all. At the same time, doctors completely and thoroughly fail to analyze these decisions in a rational cost/benefit way. Breastfeeding is a tremendous burden on career women. If not breastfeeding enables a woman to get back to work sooner, get less behind on her career progression, etc, then there is a monetary benefit to not breastfeeding, a very concrete one one that must be balanced against the tenuous and uncertain costs of not breastfeeding.<p>Same thing for drinking during pregnancy: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peggy-drexler/-a-loaded-question-on-dri_b_2150127.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peggy-drexler/-a-loaded-questi...</a>.

However, the problem is that bulk redirections like that make it very difficult to catch insecure resources.<p>For example, let's suppose you have a secure page that's referencing some JavaScript resource via a plain-text connection. Because of the redirection, the browser will ultimately fetch the required file, but only trying plain-text HTTP first. That one plain-text request can be hijacked by a man-in-the-middle attacker and abused to take over the victim's browser (and account).<p>Further, if your users have bookmarks to plain-text pages, their first access to your web site is always going to be insecure, which means that they can be attacked via sslstrip.<p>These problems are solved with Strict Transport Security, but it will probably take some time until we can fully rely on it.<p>In the meantime, the plain-text URL can be preserved, and the redirection carried out via an intermediary page that explains why links to plain-text pages are dangerous.

VIM lets you move around in INSERT mode, which is not something I'm used to either, because you can't do that in VI.

Sure, it's a good idea to be stronger rather than weaker. Moreover, it is plausible that exercises that tend to develop strength (as measured in the study) have health benefits above and beyond merely developing strength. There is certainly no reason not to exercise based on this finding. But there is also not a strong reason to predict a longer rather than shorter life from your personal strength measurement, even though the study did the usual kind of regression analysis to control for other independent variables. Simply put, this was not a treatment-control study design,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>so no inference of causation is supported here. The authors were careful to write the word ""association"" (which is honest), and the authors were careful to investigate all-cause mortality in this study population (which is thoughtful), but we don't know yet how much you or I can improve individual lifespan by doing strength-building exercises.<p>AFTER EDIT: The comment by micro_cam, which deserves your upvote for getting me started on my comment, is especially astute because it mentions that this was not a genetically sensitive study design. To answer the question posed in one of the replies this comment received, that will eventually be an issue worth looking at, which sorts of ""endophenotypes"" gain the most benefit from what sort of exercise. But we are nowhere near that level of precision of investigation yet. The statement about limitations of the study at the end of the submitted article mentions more issues.<p>Picking up on something I learned from the late Richard Feynman's comments on the Challenger explosion investigation, I would like to see a scatterplot of these data displayed over the calculated regression line, to see how much uncertainty still surrounds their model. As it is, the confidence intervals around the death rates for different categories of strength overlap considerably, so there are some strong people with the same mortality risk as some of the weaker people.",1365096701

I'm young (20), so my results may not carry over to yours, but I found that SL was great for me.  I definitely felt better after every workout, and in general felt a lot more energy.  I felt sore after the first two workouts, but that dissipated very quickly.  I've also fixed my posture (I've had TSA agents compliment my posture... not sure how I feel about that), feel much stronger day to day, and fixed some back pain.<p>As for tightness and injury...  I think a crucial and under-stated facet of strength training is that when you are strength training, the pre-eminent concern is good form.  Until you are competing and meets, there's no reason to focus strictly on lifting the highest possible weight.  In fact, there is no time pressure, you have plenty of time to set up and rest after sets, no one is watching you, nothing to cause you to sacrifice your form.  I just set up slowly, made sure I was confident for every lift, and tried as hard as I could to make each lift go through the full range of motion.  It was a surprisingly slow-and-contemplative process (and workouts for me were about an hour each).  As a result, I didn't find myself any tighter/less flexible, and I haven't gotten injured.  I see a few friends get injured, but they also tend to be the friends who sacrifice form for weight-on-bar most often.  There's no need to do that if you just check your ego at the door.<p>Point is, all sports can lead to injury.  But strength training is naturally suited to making that easy to avoid.",1365096290

It meets the ""you can't change this thing about yourself so we outsiders are going to make fun of you for it, nyah nyah"" pattern while being devoid of useful information content. Cryonics proponents do not readily concede the point that patients are technically dead, based on the evidence available.<p>The legal status (which is a fully independent use of the term ""dead"" and can be readily conceded with absolutely zero consequence to the technical argument) is something else, but if you are implying that cryonics companies would therefore be within their legal rights to dump their patients, that could just as easily be seen as a problem with the law (i.e. it fails to adequately protect cryonics patients). So it's not clear to me why you would think this is an innate ethical shortcoming of the choice to practice cryonics in the first place.<p>> companies that are under no obligation to actually do what you paid them to do<p>It certainly would contradict the purpose, and likely the bylaws, of a cryonics organization to fail to keep patients safe, for at least the period of time that is realistic given the limits of initial funding and uncontrollable factors world economic stability. (100 years is definitely more reasonable than a million.) Assuming the funds set aside experience real growth above the rate of inflation, the risk could actually decline over time because the financial safety net would be larger.<p>One possible approach if you think the time is going to be long before the needed technology is available, would be to allocate funding towards measures designed to stabilize the economy, avoid war, and/or prevent natural disasters. The other approach would be to try and create disaster-proof cryobunkers (but there's physical limits, as always).",1365096124

Even for complex websites it may still be possible to attempt to infer what you're viewing.

The site is not mentioned specifically in the paper but Amazon uses a autocomplete for it's search which exhibits similar behaviour to what is discussed in the paper. So even on a site like Amazon if you visited it over a secure connection an attacker could most likely find out what you are searching for or looking at on Amazon.",1365095091

There is thereby no chance in hell that I would have told him to turn off the arrow keys (although we both know someone who probably did, who worked with him much more closely, but he has a personality type that requires him to ""whole hog"" everything he tries ;P).<p>It also has taken me forever to get around to learning even things like ""cw"", which I only just integrated into my behaviors a year ago. It's even a running gag on the IRC channel I spend most of my time on (and where Yehuda used to hang out) that vim is something that everyone knows some barely overlapping subset of the keyboard behaviors for ;P.<p>It is true that I would have been telling him to use console versions of vim, but my definition of ""console"" has always had ""mouse support"" as a key requirement: until just about two years ago I always had ""set mouse=a"" turned on by default, which gives you the ability to click around in both command and input modes, the ability to click and drag to automatically enter visual mode, and (in particular) fully operational mouse wheel scrolling support.<p>I thereby can only imagine that Yehuda simply got such strong pressure from some subset of the people who were talking to him about vim that it got him so generally angry about the whole situation that is ""use vim"" that by 2010 he got to the point where it just seemed like ""everyone"" was telling him to ""whole hog"" vim; I thereby can happily appreciate why this article got written the way that did.<p>However, I think people repasting it around now may end up with the wrong impression of ""people who use vim"" as a whole by going back and looking at Yehuda during this one moment from 2010 and then using this article as a guide to something important today about that community.

Only evidence is this: A good friend fellow athlete (sailor olympic level windsurfer) healthy as none other, got a heart attack at the age of 33.

The article does mention one other phenomenon though, and it's the selective nature of what we share. It has been discussed in the media that Facebook can make some people angry, envious, and depressed (<a href=""http://ti.me/V9kKkd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ti.me/V9kKkd</a>). By selectively broadcasting our successes to the world, whether it's a promotion at work or awesome tacos, we contribute to a tapestry of a superficial, though entirely false, view of the world. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't want to broadcast my failures any more than you do. It's natural to want to share only the good things.<p>I'll use myself for example. I'm not particularly prone to sharing or to envy (at least, that's what I thought). I rarely posted anything to Facebook, and when I did, it was science or news related. I even felt violated when others posted pictures of me. However, after about two years worth of Facebook use, mostly lurking, I was surprised to find that I was angry with just about all of my ""friends."" It seemed they were so much happier than me,  wittier, more liked, more photogenic. Their families seemed so perfect, while mine was in smoldering ruins due to tragedy, divorce, and bitter grudges. Their posts got loads of likes and comments, while mine received few or none. They also seemed, well, so dumb: they wrote ""are"" for ""our"" and mixed up ""they're,"" ""their,"" ""and ""there."" And they broadcast inane political rants, which, turns out, is a great way to ensure that I'll never want to hang out with them again.<p>So, in turn, for me at least, I found it had affected me negatively, so I quit using Facebook, and I think it made me much happier and a better friend. I stopped placing expectations upon my life by what I had seen on Facebook. And, most of all, I was shocked to discover how judgmental I had been toward these people. I'm the guy who is often jokingly referred to as the family shrink. Everyone comes to me with problems because I'm patient, I listen, and I don't judge. Well, on Facebook, I was a different person. I was brutal. And that attitude alienated me because I found that I couldn't like people in real life whom I couldn't respect in digital life, whether it be due to my own selfishness or their poor grammar. Perhaps that's why I rarely postedI felt that I would be judged just as I had judged them, and I feared rejection.<p>Now when I talk to my friends, they seemed shocked that they have to fill me in on things that have been thoroughly covered on Facebook. But when we do talk, it isn't infused with the expectation to please. I can be honest, and so can they, and there's no need to feel like we're having a loud conversation while sitting at the center table in a crowded restaurant.<p>I don't think this applies to everyone. I have a friend who doesn't seem the least bit bothered by this. Maybe I'm emotionally weak, or overly sensitive, or more prone to envy than I would like to think. And I don't condemn Facebook entirely. Like you said, I think we're still working this whole thing out, and we have yet to figure out how to positively integrate it into our lives. Even so, I think for some people, no amount of sharing is good, not if we're only sharing the good bits.",1365094822

Totally normal though.<p>Got some good advice recently to not change him in the middle of the night.  Less stimulation so he goes back to sleep faster which means you get more sleep too.  Felt weird about it at first but it's totally fine.  That morning diaper will be a heavy one though!<p>We don't just let him cry yet, but we're also lucky because the kid doesn't cry unless he needs something so YMMV...",1365094803

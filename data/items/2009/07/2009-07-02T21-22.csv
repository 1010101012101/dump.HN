685248,comment,684840,685220,0,0,Chickencha,,,"To me, market segmentation is different when it comes to software.<p>In your text editor example, the author can add an SFTP feature, but once it's coded it's coded. There's no extra cost to ship out all software with that feature after it's coded, except perhaps some extra support costs. (I imagine those would be pretty minimal.) At that point, I only see two reasons to segment the market from the users' perspective:<p>1) To not confuse your less advanced users with more features. This is a pretty weak reason, IMO.
2) To make sure that the people who actually wanted the feature are the ones paying for it. After the cost of development is paid for, this reason goes away.<p>Beyond these reasons (unless I'm missing something, which is entirely possible), releasing different grades of software just hurts your users. It makes you more money, though, so maybe that's enough justification.",1246571591

They are effectively extensions of UNIX-derived operating systems, i.e. they run under ""UNIX VM"". They even have a garbage collection of sorts: when you exit the program, the memory gets freed. And, according to Linux philosophy, launching processes or forking/dying should be quick, efficient and, in fact, desirable. Also, having many independent binary modules is the norm, so here is your runtime encapsulation.<p>But C family is still the only tool out there that allows you to extend an OS, i.e. for instance to build a piece of code, a <i>single instance</i> of which will be serving <i>all other simultaneously running processes</i>. This explains why Apache eats so little RAM. None of VM-based languages can do that. It's called systems programming.<p>Building a web-based CRM in C++ is stupid.

685220,comment,684840,685035,0,0,CodeMage,,,"Because market segmentation in itself, as a concept, is not a disadvantage, which means that lack of it is not an advantage in itself.<p>Like I said, market segmentation in software does not necessarily have to be a bad thing. Consider a hypothetical text editor that comes in two editions. The ""basic"" edition has features like syntax highlighting, regex search and replace, etc. The ""advanced"" edition has a feature that allows you to open and save files not just locally, but also via SFTP. When it was first written, the editor didn't have the SFTP feature, the author developed it because there were some users who asked for it; they weren't the majority, but the author thought the idea was nice. Instead of incorporating that feature into the one and only edition, the author decided to offer two editions: a cheaper ""basic"" and a more expensive ""advanced"" edition. It was the author's idea of placing value on the effort involved in writing the SFTP feature. The majority of users can go on happily using the ""basic"" edition without paying extra for it, while those who really want SFTP can pay for it.<p>One way of looking at this market segmentation is to say that the author was greedy and imposed an artificial limitation on one of the editions in his product. Another way of looking at it is to say that the author offers two products that satisfy different needs at different costs. If we were talking about two products from two different authors, we would be comparing their features and prices quite naturally, without complaining about market segmentation.<p>However, when you're offering exactly the same product, with no differences, for two different prices, then you're just being greedy and taking advantage of your customers (which is something commonplace nowadays and most people, myself included, just accept it). Close to that is the situation in which you slap a truly artificial restriction on a cheaper edition of your product, not through a lack of feature, but through a deliberate crippling of that feature (e.g. the five-dollar edition can open only up to 3 files). The exception, of course, is a crippled free edition which allows potential customers to try your product before deciding whether to buy it. In that case, you're just being annoying ;)<p>That, in summary, is why I believe that market segmentation is an advantage, within certain ethical bounds.",1246570264

It's not like colonies that large only have a single queen. And with a large number of queens there is the possibility of genetic divergence from each other.<p>Unless the ants in those colonies have developed some sort of system themselves where they distribute new queens/males from one part of the colony to another... but I can't imagine that it would be easy for them to transport breeding ants (or for those ants to fly for that matter) 900km from one side of the colony to the other.<p>On the other hand, when it's time to mate, all the breeding/flying ants take to the sky.

685199,comment,684990,685049,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We have large projects under both BSD and GPL. We have different motivations for each, and the different licenses suit our needs. I'm always astonished by the self-righteous tone on both sides of the debate (though I find BSD extremists far more annoying for some reason...maybe just because RMS has inoculated me to the most obnoxious bits of GPL extremism).<p>And, yes, it <i>is</i> about who's in control; I don't see what's bad about that.  If I wrote the code, I can exert as much or as little control over that code as I want...including making it more difficult for businesses to fork the code and distribute it under their own brand without giving back.<p><i>I have yet to hear about a BSD project that went under because of some company that refused to contribute back. I do however know of a couple of projects that thrived because of more liberal licenses.</i><p>This is a specious argument.  One can point to dozens of GPL projects that have thrived because of the GPL; and none that went under because of something some third party did or didn't do.<p>Linux is one example of thriving GPL code, while the BSD-licensed competitors are dramatically less popular.  Could it be because the BSD world forked off into dozens of competing commercial and free versions in the early days?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  I dunno.  But, for every BSD success story you'd like to trot out, I can trot out an equal number of GPL success stories.  And, again, I'm a developer on projects that ""prove"" that both licenses are effective.<p>I can also assure you that the BSD projects see far less giving back than the GPL project, relative to total number of corporate users.  When I worked as an IT guy, I regularly came upon server ""appliance"" products that used our software with a custom theme and heavy modifications, and we'd never even spoken to the company in question; the BSD permits that, and we aren't offended by that usage.  It certainly isn't going to kill the project.  <i>But</i>, in the case where we wanted more control, and had a very strong interest in that <i>never</i> happening because it would seriously impact our ability to build the products we wanted to build, we opted for the GPL license.",1246569378

685187,comment,684840,684962,0,0,gizmo,,,"> a reasonable technical explanation<p>Alright, I can come up with a reasonable explanation:<p>For databases and servers a lot of bugs and corner cases are only hit by servers that get loads and loads of traffic. Fixing those bugs cost a significant amount of money. By charging more to the high-traffic servers the cost of fixing those bugs can be justified.<p>It is also fair, in a sense, because only the high throughput servers really benefit from the extensive testing and stability, so why shouldn't they be the ones to pay for the fixes?",1246569125

685172,comment,684251,684896,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"All true, but you can make those rules work for you. First, genre expectations are different. Generally you need a famous name attached to sell a movie, and you can't get one. But horror fans don't care much about actors. (Neither do sci-fi fans, but sci-fi is exponentially harder to pull off). And fortunately, horror fans like bargain-bin, formulaic movies.<p>There are plenty of horror and no-budget festivals, so if your film is not total crap then you have a good chance in being selected for one. That'll help you get more money from the distributor, but if you don't succeed it's not too much of a loss.<p>The union doesn't matter too much. The lower your production budget, the less likely they are to bother you. SAG (actors) has a very cool deal for no-budget films that lets the actors work for free or minimum wage. Writer's guild just does not care below 6 figures. Ditto for the crew and camera unions. Of course the less you have to spend the less you can get in the way of experienced people, but if you have a few enthusiastic key people who are willing to shepherd some enthusiastic amateurs, you'll be fine.<p>RED One is an amazing camera, but I wouldn't use it for this kind of project. It's still pricey, and says that you have money but you're not willing to spend it on the crew. For the dirt-poor filmmaker, what you want is a Panasonic HVX or similar that shoots 24/5P and which can put out or be converted to something that looks fairly decent at 720p. And a friendly producer.<p>If you turn in a film that does not completely suck for under $50,000, you can probably sell it for enough to get your production costs back.",1246568625

3760402,comment,3759938,3760246,1,0,creamyhorror,,,"Well said. As in some casinos, in the world's stock markets some big players (probably including certain HFTs and hedge funds) take much more of the winnings than small ones, due to information asymmetry or pure competitive advantage (e.g. due to extremely fast trading and advanced algorithms).<p>The more money is sucked from the market by intelligent arbitrageurs/gamblers, the less there is for small(er) investors. That's a bad thing in itself and also increases the focus on financial gameplay (analysis of market trends and fads) to the detriment of investment (analysis of the worth of companies). Frothy, ever-rising stock markets attract investment away from other markets, usually for poor reasons: the traded companies haven't done anything that would justify such rapid and significant changes in their stock values.<p>The point of the stock market is <i>not</i> to let the smartest people profit from the rest; it's to allow companies to raise capital efficiently and fairly. If we tweak the rules of the market, by limiting trade frequency for example, we may be able to push the play in the market towards a form that aligns better with this core function of the market.<p>Finally, I want to reiterate that for a closed population, the stock market is a zero-sum game. Money made is won from someone else, always.<p><i>edit: i'd appreciate you mentioning the points you disagree with when you give your downvotes - thanks</i>",1332831587

1. Have a ""done"" list - people get motivated by seeing what they get done and feel good about themseleves when they are reocrding what they have done, and feel bad when staring things they need to do .<p>2. Pair-wise to-do list. Randomly pair a user to a different user and they both use various means to motivate each other and provide means to help each other. This is social interaction and people feel some responsibility to get things done when they have someone to answer to, while others dont want to expose their private life.<p>3. Bombard the user with notifications on what needs to get done or give user with positive enforcement every hour, in order to motivate the user.<p>There are 2 issues to be addressed: Motivation and organization. If the data is not easily organizable, user dont feel like vesting. If user does not have anything motivating to do those actions, rather than procrastinating, your system is plain doomed.",1332831578

As a result, users tend to be more careless or perhaps even callous in the use of down votes.

3760356,comment,3760045,3760335,25,0,frisco,,,"First, there's a lot of bad science out there.  A large part of this is due to the fact that animal models are almost uniformly terrible at modeling real human disease.  Second, a therapy may be highly effective but also highly toxic or have other severe risks or side effects, which are hard to tell in preclinical research.  The bar here is very high, and trials can easily be pulled over a few ""adverse events.""  Third, it's rare that investigational drugs are used as first-line therapies; so, the patients getting them are usually the ones in worst shape.  This can lead to all kinds of problems in demonstrating efficacy.  Also, if your drug <i>does</i> get through trials, the FDA looks very hard at who the drug was tested on and can narrowly limit the indications it receives.  So, if you develop ""promising drug X"", and it's trialled on Stage IV glioblastoma patients who express marker Y and are (for whatever reason) over the age of 45 and mostly female, then you're going to be limited to > 45 year old females with Stage IV glioblastoma expressing marker Y, until you can prove safety and efficacy in another population. But the vast majority of drugs never get anywhere near here: they mostly fail in safety or fail to demonstrate effectiveness early on.  (An interesting side note here is that many of the signals you look for to estimate your ""effectiveness"", like size of tumor, don't always correlate to long-term survival.  You can have a drug that appears to shrink tumors and patients still dying.  It's really common to see good indicators of progress with little or no impact on survival.)<p>TL;DR: animal models of disease mostly suck.",1332830543

You don't need to argue this point, I know that a lot of guys are assholes in any field, and I don't for one moment doubt that any of the stories about what women have experienced are true.<p>I'm just not yet convinced that a significant number of women actually avoid the field because of this (and scattered anecdotes aren't convincing here since the numbers in need of explanation are so huge). Primarily because women rarely enter the field - no, that's not right, because they rarely even enter <i>preliminary training</i> for the field, in the first place, so there's not much of a chance for them to be driven away by the behavior of men in IT at all.<p>We're losing women very early in the funnel, and I need some real evidence to swallow the claim that the pain that the 17% (or whatever small number) that end up in IT experience is the reason we lose the first 33%. As someone that has paid a lot of bills by working on conversion funnel optimization, I can tell you for sure that I'd <i>absolutely never</i> assume, a priori, that the latter part of the ""women in tech"" funnel was the one we should be focusing on, based on the numbers - you <i>always</i> look upstream first, especially when you see stats as bad as in tech, and only once you're satisfied that those are the best you can achieve with reasonable efforts do you start to look at later steps.<p>If the freshman CS male to female ratio was 50/50, I'd agree that we should assume on-the-job treatment was the ""leak""; but it's not, based on ETS numbers, by the time girls take the SAT, they only make up 12% of the people intending to major in CS - there's already a 9 to 1 ratio, <i>even before college!</i> The ratio for in the workforce is actually <i>better</i> than the corresponding rate upon entering college, which means more women end up moving <i>towards</i> the field when it comes time to picking a job than away from it.

I <i>have</i> heard many plausible reasons that girls are either not interested in, pushed away from, or not pushed towards tech, and that's a separate matter, the one that I think is most worthy of discussion. But it has absolutely nothing to do with the behavior of the men actually in the field, at least as far as the arguments I've heard go.",1332829928

The only reason it's even remotely successful is probably because there's a general correlation between experienced coders and coders who know these subjects well.

Identify your developer coworkers who you look up to, and come up with equivalent topics for their coding platform of choice then randomly ask them about them. For example, drop by and say something like ""hey, I always forget, could you explain abstract classes to me?"" Or something like that. I'd be curious what the results were.",1332828964

Otherwise rational arguments that happen to contain unpopular opinions are the canonical example, but sometimes the reasons are just puzzling.<p>So I thought I'd make this post, so we could discuss it as a community - is it OK, or is it not?<p>In my opinion, in addition to being rude, it's ineffective; the person who got downvoted is never going to change their opinion based on what you say, and it's important to keep in mind that they're not always wrong; many times I've replied with a disagreement, and either learned something or changed my mind completely.<p>Obvious trolling or childish arguments are a different kettle of fish; we're actively trying to push those people off of HN, which is what we're doing by hitting the downvote arrow.<p>What does everyone else think? I'm happy to be proved wrong about this, but I think it's important to have the discussion, and I'm not sure we have recently.<p>As pointed out by avree, pg five years ago said it is OK, because people upvote based on agreement:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=117171",1332828646

In fact, their entire existence in early years is in dealing with understanding the world.<p>I saw this in action the other day in a local coffee shop.  In front of me was a mother with a child of about 4 who pointed out to her mother than high on a shelf above Italian coffee machine was a small, plastic toy from the children's program ""In the Night Garden"".<p>I certainly hadn't noticed it and neither had the mother. Which isn't surprising because the mother (and I) were in the coffee shop with a head full of other stuff (buying coffee, work thoughts, relationship thoughts, etc. etc.)  The four year old was in full observe the entire world mode.

A mannequin would probably give a much better indication of how items of clothing stretch (or dont stretch) in different places across the body. I imagine this would be very difficult to simulate with current tech.<p>Logistics though? How do you (cheaply) mass produce mannequins with entirely different dimensions? 3D printer?<p>Also how would the clothing be fitted to the mannequin? Robots? Do we have a robot that can dress people yet?",1332828241

There was a recent very good example of this concerning Apple : When Steve Jobs died, they kept the information secret and agreed with the stock exchange to suspend trading for a day. The time for everyone to think about what it meant for the company instead of hysterically following a random trend. A big event, obviously changing the company's intrinsic value, was interpreted with a daily period. Everything I read about high frequency trading indicates that it is mainly noise.<p>I mean, stock exchanges close at night and during week ends. There are 48 hours without quotations.

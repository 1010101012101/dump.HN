If the city of New York wants to offer a complete service then they should add a taxi service as part of the MTA.  Also, I don't think I mentioned race.

1908606,comment,1906444,1908085,0,0,teilo,,,"There are really two kinds of deflation. Servicing a debt and paying off a debt. Paying off a debt early causes LESS money to be sucked out of the economy in the form of interest, and increases the intrinsic value of one's financial assets. This increases the value of the dollar both by decreasing its supply, and increasing its perceived value internationally. In this scenario, bank loans are continuing to be made because the financial health of the nation, in general, is good.<p>However, deflation can also be caused servicing loans when no further loans are being made. Interest is sucking cash out of the economy, and loans are not being made to replace it. Because much of our productivity is based upon the ability to acquire easy credit, such deflation causes a halt to productivity, which leads to a further inability to service existing loans. Default follows, with the flotsam of toxic assets in its wake. Very bad news.<p>In a central bank system, both forms of deflation inevitably lead to inflation. The hope of central bankers is to control the currency supply such that just enough cash is added in the form of loans to keep the system solvent. However, central planning of an economy never works, and thus we come to the latter form of inflation, which is what we were experiencing just before the bundle of bailouts from the lest several years.<p>In the latter form of deflation, not only is the dollar perceived as worthless, but it is further devalued by the reactionary inflation which is invariably used to ""solve"" the crisis. So as you can see, inevitably it is inflation that causes the cost of overseas goods and services to increase.<p>You have to consider why exactly it is that the cost of goods and services overseas would normally be going up:<p>China is holding has bought vast sums of US Dollars in order to keep their currency low in relation to the dollar. By buying lots of dollars, China exchanges dollars for Yuan. Yuans flood the market, but China locks up the dollars in the bank. Yuans are inflated. The Dollar is deflated. The Dollars still exist - but they are not in circulation. If China were to liquidate their reserves of US Dollars, this would result in massive inflation. But China can only keep this up for so long. If we flood the market with dollars faster than China can buy them relative to its own currency, this strategy will fail, and eventually China will be forced to liquidate its dollar reserves. This will have the effect of driving the price of the Yuan up, and the Dollar further down.",1289868943

If defense spending pays my salary and my salary pays my taxes, my taxes can't be any higher than 100%, and if my taxes are 100% then me losing my job due to cuts in defense spending can't cost the government more in tax receipts than it's gaining back by paying my salary.<p>""You'll convert some energy to other sources, but not much, if it was so easy we would do it already.""<p>Why?

I am very sensitive to bullshit myself and can't stand it in others and so maybe the main thing about Game that bothers me is how much it violates the golden rule for me. To impress me, just be who the fuck you are, you know?<p>That being said, I can't work around the fact that my sexual value isn't even just near zero right now, it's precisely zero. I'd probably settle down with any smart and nice woman who wasn't any worse than somewhat below average looking. Things that fall into place naturally for other men don't work for me. So it's basically a choice between never touching a girl in my life without paying for it or working my ass off for a few years to try and manipulate women enough that one or two will want to be close to me someday, and that's a much easier choice.",1289867894

It allows you to send a message over an insecure link and verify, by providing the secret key, that the message (and hash) was not tampered with.<p>Also, a salted hash is not a particularly good storage mechanism, ranking only above cleartext and naively-hashed storage.  Once someone discovers the salt, then it's fairly easy to attack the password database in the same way that you'd attack an unsalted hash -- make a list of all possible passwords, hash them, and see what matches.  Machines like the one mentioned in the article can make trillions of these in a second.  The problem with hashes for protecting passwords is that they can be calculated very quickly; good for ensuring that every packet on your VPN arrived without errors, bad for ensuring that a bad guy can't make a list of passwords, hash them, and check the hashes against your database.<p>The best password storage mechanism is via the use of a ""slow"" hash function like bcrypt or scrypt.  You set these up so that it takes a full second of CPU time to generate the hash from the message.  Then instead of trying trillions of passwords a second, the attacker can only try one!<p>If you're using Perl, use Authen::Passphrase.  It's a module that lets you easily use bcrypt for new passwords but your old method for older passwords.

I've got my eye on a couple of books on stoicism next, but the priority queue is getting bumped by some important technical material that needs reading.<p>The problem here -- and I didn't go into this in the review -- is that nobody really knows exactly what the stoics taught. Or rather, the things they taught at different times. Stoicism was both Greek and Roman, and there were schools that adapted (and stole from each other and competed for students). So the situation was very much in a state of flux. It also had a deep spiritual component, although it's definitely not religious. (The book author is an atheist)<p>What Irvine did was take later Roman Stoicism, used famous Romans as an example (including Aurelius) and pieced together his best version of a mish-mash of what stoicism can mean for us. So there's a bit of creative license going on, but the author is clear enough about what's happening for it not to be a problem. Because Irvine was so clear about how he put it all together, and the book so well-written, I didn't view the religious roots or the mish-mash nature of the presentation as an important detail. Others might be upset that I didn't mention it. Meh. Part of the pain in the ass of being a book reviewer, I guess.

I mean, I was a couple of times questioned at the airport, with the usual questions (""did anyone other than you have access to your baggage?"", etc.) and once they ordered me to open my baggage - and that didn't make me feel more safe or anything like that, rather uncomfortable and a bit pissed of, in a ""wtf? do you seriously think I'm gonna explode the plane or what?"" way.
Shortly speaking, I prefer to go through all those gates, have my baggage checked by security guys themselves (""go ahead, there's nothing there"") than being bothered by some questions and be ""under suspicion"".

Unless a new interface could be invented, there's far too much friction in the idea, and like any network, it's value is proportional to the number of nodes.  Unless <i>all</i> of a person's plans are in there, the value falls quickly.<p>It's pretty simple to see this - few of us even keep our 'formal' calendar up to date, of meetings, calls and plans.  Very few people keep their 'informal' calendar up to date.  I, for one, never create a task called 'buy truck', 'plan holiday'.  The important, high value items never need to be written down.  The ones that get tracked and remembered are the low-value ones like 'pay electricity bill' and 'pick up worming tablets for dog'.  And they're the ones with little advertising value.<p>That said, there is probably a specific vertical niche in here that could be expanded, but more of an add-on to an existing network like facebook than a stand alone.

I learned a long time ago that how you frame something for the user changes how they will interact with it. A common example I refer to is a small textarea on a website, and some clients wanting to see that textarea larger to encourage their users to write more in the box, or witnessing a user stopping and editing their post to frame it inside of the available area without going over.<p>The same with passwords, they imply a word. A much better solution is a pass phrase. As far as the system is concerned, functionally identical. But to the human mind, a completely different animal. A word is a word, but a phrase is limitless. With proper punctuation and capitalization, it has everything that makes a good password good: A-z, symbols, length. Except, being a phrase, it has an edge to a long complex password: you can remember it. A phrase has a beginning, middle, and an end.",1289865707

Okay so if it happened a lot, just give me some tidbit. Anything. I don't mean to be intentionally negative but this is a book review and the author has included nothing but a buzz-wordy sounding definition of the purpose of Stoicism: ""to have a joyous, happy, fun-filled life by better learning the art of living"". I understand the ""you have to read it man!"" kind of attitude about books that lead to huge paradigm shifts but there's a middle ground where one or two ideas can be explained, an outline of content can be created, modern ideas and these ideas can be contrasted.",1289865617

Other policies, whether you agree with them or not, affect the market more than the other way around.  For an extreme example, see Cuba, where social engineering routed the market, with results that are disastrous in many ways.  Other social engineering experiments, such as universal education up to a certain age in most western countries, seem to have been a net positive for society, even if they are imperfect.<p>Also, I think that some ""social engineering"", such as keeping people from starving to death, and ensuring they don't freeze to death for want of a warm place to sleep, at a minimum, should not be routed around.",1230666988

(This was a while ago, so I am sure they are better now. About 5 years ago.) This is in an area which has a number of competitors, all who had fine tuned what the store offered to the local market. The area has people with high income and a lot of (rich) immigrants, think Saudi, stock brokers etc.<p>The Tesco store's range of products was awful for the first 12 months. It was like they had drop-shipped a generic store, tuned for general suburbia, and then slowly tried to fine tune it. 50% of what they sold seemed to be the wrong stuff for the market.<p>They later opened a Tesco Express as well, just a couple of blocks away, and compared to the Marks and Spensers Food Only store down the street (which opened a year later) it was awful, really bad. I couldn't go in and actually buy anything I wanted there other than maybe milk. I have visited recently and the Tesco Express is still there, the same crappy collection of goods and hardly anyone seems to buy anything. Whereas the M&S is packed.<p>It could well be that the area, Kensington / Earls Court, has such a special set of clientele in it that the ""standard"" model of product provisioning for Tesco just doesn't cut it. But I could have easily come up with a better set of products to sell in there myself and I am just a customer not a retail specialist.<p>So I guess I am saying that I think there is plenty of scope for improvement.",1230666746

Some things are best explained by identifiers, and needing to comment them is a sign of poor code. On the other hand, some code requires domain-specific knowledge to understand why it does what it does, and as much of that knowledge as possible should be spelled out (or at least cited) in comments. I have written modules where no comments were needed anywhere. On the other hand, I have written modules where every line required a paragraph, a figure, and a short proof. The best guideline is that comments should say as much as it's possible to say without going off topic or repeating things that are obvious from the code.",1230666010

Why would a city with low rents have any impetus to impose rent control?<p>""There can be no doubt that rent control creates housing shortages. For almost 20 years, national vacancy rates have been at or above 7 percent--a figure generally considered normal. Cities such as Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix, where development is welcomed, have often had vacancy rates above 15 percent.""<p>Yes, but these are also sprawling shitholes.  And:  ridiculously high vacancy rates are a good thing now?<p>""Young people who migrate to New York or San Francisco usually must settle for paying $600 a month to share a two-bedroom apartment with several other people or commuting from a nearby city. Crowding is a manifestation of rent control.""<p>It has nothing to do with NYC being an island and SF being a peninsula.  And we'll ignore that if you consider an area the size of Houston around both of these cities, you start seeing affordable housing again - commuting 5 miles from <i>another</i> city is a bad thing, but commuting 20 miles from <i>the same</i> city is awesome.<p>""The goal in getting rid of rent control should be to allow the curve of housing prices to return to the elegant symmetry of the free market.""<p>Ah, so it's an aesthetic concern.<p>This is just a ridiculous article.  There are 3 cities cited as suffering from the supposed ill-effects of rent control, New York, San Francisco, and San Jose (and Boston has ""overtones of the rent-control effect at the upper end"", whatever that means).  The data that illustrates the supposed terrible effects of rent control is the price of apartments on the market on one weekend, completely ignoring the <i>entire point</i> of rent control, which is to allow people to stay in their homes (which the article perversely tries to twist into people becoming ""prisoners of their own apartment"" - because people in great locations in NYC and SF would otherwise really want to move if only their apartments weren't so damn cheap).  There's never any attempt to prove that rent control actually drives out affordable housing, there's only the ""no shit, that's the point"" observation that newcomers to an in-demand city with rent control pay more.<p>I moved to San Francisco last February, and I'm moving to New York in a month, so I'm not exactly a fan of rent control - I know my price is much higher than my neighbor's because of it.  At the same time, though, I recognize that it's really shitty that I could take my programmer's salary and use it like a club against the people who were already living in the city.

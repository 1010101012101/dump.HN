1567958,comment,1567894,1567894,0,0,byoung2,,,"I think part of the loyalty numbers for iPhone users is the substantial investment they make in other Apple hardware, software, and App Store apps.  Unfortunately, I don't have any hard data to back this up, but I imagine a large percentage of iPhone users have at least one other piece of Apple hardware, such as a Mac, iPad, iPod Touch, etc., that works seamlessly alongside the iPhone and iTunes.  That makes it tougher to break away from the iPhone.  My coworker is one such example.  He has an iPhone, a Macbook, and a Mac Mini.  He loves the fact that iTunes ties them all together, and wouldn't get a different phone because of it.<p>Android doesn't have that kind of integration, simply because there isn't that tight integration.  For example, my girlfriend and I both have Android phones, but everything else we have is Microsoft (2 laptops on XP and Vista, a media center PC and a Viliv S5 tablet on Windows 7, and an XBox 360).  If Google could get all of those other devices dependent on Google software like Apple does with iTunes, they'd have a shot at keeping people loyal.<p>You'll also notice that Microsoft missed a big opportunity here.  In addition to all of that Microsoft hardware, we used to both have Windows Mobile phones, but there was nothing to tie them all together like iTunes.  I would have thought something like XBox Live Marketplace could have worked (e.g. as a central place to buy content for all my devices, share contacts and data, etc.), but Microsoft never executed.  Maybe with Windows Phone 7 they will...",1280764700

You start fudging the code until it compiles."" is down right negligent at best - C++ will tell you at exactly in which file, at which line and in which function called from which class your error was caused (more than i can say for other languages) and, i'm sorry, but if you don't know that compiler errors wrap the code in ' ' then wtf have you been doing since the dinosaur age when C++ had no stl?<p>yes, the STL makes compiler errors extra long but to say you need to fudge with your code to make it work is a spray of FUD to anyone looking to get into the language.<p>To close this, everything he said in his ""hard to read"" could be applied to any languages with mutability.

If you are managing a multi-million-account credit card portfolio on a single mainframe, which nicely supports all your realtime apps (including a 100-request per second authorizations system) and your 6-hour batch cycle, there is no reason at all to port that to smaller machines.

Since it wasn't accessible to the internet (or even most of the network), it didn't need to have any time spent on it trying to secure it against the latest Windows bug. It never required software updates, other than the ones that we coded ourselves and deployed without having to reboot anything. The database didn't fall over when we ran a payroll job or report cards.<p>But, best of all -- and I love telling this story, because I think it really illustrates something that the techs using all the modern stuff just don't ""get"" -- it had the best recovery systems I have ever seen, hands down.<p>So, one day there was a power outage.

Having learned C, Java, SQL, Common Lisp, and Scheme on my own, I have no doubt that programmers will jump to COBOL when the marketplace starts offering rewards (higher salaries) for doing so. The outsourcing trend is holding this back as companies continue to pursue the holy grail of cheap programmers, but all such efforts eventually run afoul of the need for local talent with a deep understanding of the application. A good programmer can get up to speed on COBOL very quickly. Getting up to speed on a large application? That'll take a few years.<p>The problem with legacy apps on any platform is not the language (unless you're talking about some very obscure unsupported language). The problem in my experience is the tangled mess of new code piled on top of poorly designed old code. In such systems, a small change can have unintended side effects. The solution is exhaustive testing (expensive and time-consuming) or a Hail Mary installation (leading to ""testing"" in production and yet another reactive fix). COBOL didn't create this problem and changing to another language won't fix it. In my shop, we practice test-driven development and deliver high quality releases.

There's a perception that mainframes are more reliable than commodity-parts systems.  In truth I think this is confirmation and sample bias; if you run a business that has a mainframe (very expensive, built for reliability, software has had 20+ years of debugging) and a bunch of servers (inexpensive, cost-optimized, software is constant work-in-progress), it's always going to seem as though the mainframe is unbreakable and everything else is dangerously unreliable.

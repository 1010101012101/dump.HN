The rest of the offerings are further down the stack (testing, RF, etc.) so the only thing you would be missing as a non-YC company trying to build a prototype to get into YC is discounts.<p>If you are hand assembling your prototypes then you only have PCB fabrication costs, which for a 2 to 4 layer board should be about $500 max for your protos (1 week turn). That should be doable for most start-ups, even if they need 3-4 spins.",1423162786

9005108,comment,8995352,8995352,0,0,kjs3,,,"Depends on what you want to do career-wise, and what&#x27;s going to make you happy.<p>There are billions of lines of COBOL running out there, doing all the unhip, non-HN, bread and butter IT/MIS types of things that keep the world running (like getting your paycheck right, or processing your insurance claim, or calculating your utility bill).  Because many of these applications incorporate decades of tribal knowledge and accumulated tweaks, all the &quot;COBOL needs to die&quot; nonsense in the world will not make them go away in my lifetime, and probably not in yours.  And since the cool kids keep hearing that COBOL is the ultimate in looser languages, you are correct that there&#x27;s a declining pool of COBOL talent.  One of my clients even funded the CS department at the local CC so that there would be a COBOL/Mainframe oriented degree track to develop talent.<p>Up side: You&#x27;ll be in a field with declining talent but not equally declining demand and will generally be able to find  a job and be paid well (though don&#x27;t count on off-the-charts compensation).  You&#x27;ll usually work in mature, stable operational environments at large, established companies.  You&#x27;ll almost always be involved in core business processes, making you less likely to be the subject of cuts when budgets get tight.<p>Down side: There are no COBOL start-up companies; you won&#x27;t be working on cutting edge stuff.  &quot;Modify the taxation calculator to reflect changes in the FY2015 tax code&quot; would be typical projects.  Stable also usually == staid & bureaucratic, and if that sort of work environment annoys you, you won&#x27;t be happy.  COBOL is a horrid, ugly language especially if you&#x27;re used most anything else.  COBOL is often tied to IBM Mainframes, so it&#x27;s somewhat rare to not have to also know something about z/OS, CICS and other IBM-isms.  Hipsters and brogrammers will judge you negatively not because of your talent or accomplishments, but because you solved problems with COBOL, instead of their choice of cooler languages (I get this some times having done a fair bit of FORTRAN back in the day by people who ignore how cool the problems we were solving were).<p>So if career stability is important enough to give up on faster paced, more cutting edge environments, then you might  give COBOL a go.",1423162691

9005097,comment,9004287,9004765,0,0,corin_,,,"That doesn&#x27;t mean prices won&#x27;t change because of it.<p>As a simplified example, let&#x27;s say poor person A is renting an apartment from rich person B for $500/month. The new system gives everyone $500/month basic income, but to pay for this rich person B has to pay $1000/month more in tax (of which he gets back half as basic income), while poor person A doesn&#x27;t pay more tax. So essentially poor person A is getting $500/month from rich person B. Obviously it wouldn&#x27;t be that simple in reality, but roughly speaking that&#x27;s what a universal basic income covered by taxes would mean - money flows from rich to poor, in varying degrees.<p>Now sticking to the simplified two-person version, rich person A thinks &quot;well poor person B could afford my $500/month rent before, now their income has gone up $500/month, so if I charge them $1000/month rent I know they can still afford it&quot;. The end result would be wasting time on behalf of the government and indeed the individuals to update everything while money split would remain identical, the only difference being that $500 now flows from B to A (via tax and basic income) then back to B (via rent increase).<p>Obviously in the non-simplified world it wouldn&#x27;t be as easy as saying &quot;that person is now getting some money from my taxes so I can charge them that much more&quot;, and numbers wouldn&#x27;t be exact... but as a rough theory, pricing definitely could alter at least to some extent.<p>All that said: I&#x27;m not an economist, I don&#x27;t know if that would happen, or to what extent. And my personal non-educated opinion is that basic income would be a good thing anyway.",1423162561

Whatever libraries or frameworks they&#x27;re using, the payload size is almost always several hundred kilobytes.<p>I&#x27;d argue that using small libraries is a noble goal, but in practice, you just need several hundred KB of JavaScript to build modern apps. If we&#x27;re honest with ourselves about it, we can try to do a good job of managing it from the beginning. Otherwise you just end up with an ad hoc mess.<p>The other point I tried to make here is that, yes, of course, you can do all of this by hand.

9005080,comment,9002713,9004010,0,0,chc,,,"I think you actually understand the philosophical basis of property and why it doesn&#x27;t apply to ideas better than you&#x27;re letting on here, but I&#x27;ll answer this anyway.<p>Ownership of physical property is natural because physical property is inherently rivalrous and excludable — if you take my hammer, I can&#x27;t use it, and thus I need to keep my hammer in my shed if I want to have access to it when I need it. Ownership makes natural sense there. It&#x27;s essential to security.<p>Ideas are not the same way. Any number of people can think an idea, and in fact an idea becomes just as much a part of everyone who thinks it as the first person who thought it, and you literally can&#x27;t take an idea back once you have shared it. Ideas are not just <i>easy</i> to copy, they aren&#x27;t even entities that need copying. The mind is constantly taking in and assimilating ideas and creating its own.<p>I&#x27;m not actually against copyright. I think there is a sound moral basis for it, in that otherwise an increasing number of people wouldn&#x27;t be able to enjoy the fruits of their labor. I just don&#x27;t think there is a moral justification for the tortured concept of <i>eternal</i> copyright. Eventually, any successful idea will become so diffused throughout society that it&#x27;s just an utter farce to pretend it is not part of the commons.<p>If nothing else, infinitely decreasing the number of ideas that may be legally had is so harmful to society that it outweighs any good that could possibly come from it. In other words, even if we say &quot;Sure, let&#x27;s pretend treating ideas as property is a natural fit,&quot; the Lockean Proviso warns us against allowing them to remain property forever.",1423162436

Even if we say you can cut half of that out (Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, etc), let&#x27;s call it $2 trillion dollars.<p>So we need $11 trillion dollars of tax money to fund this.  The total net worth of US private people is $67 trillion or so[1]. The aggregate net worth of the top 400 people in the USA is $2.3 trillion[2].  You could take all of their money, and still not even come close to paying for the program for ONE YEAR.<p>At that point, you start having to come down hard on the upper middle class.  The top 25% owns roughly 73% of the wealth in the country, or ~$48 trillion.  If you tax their NET WORTH at 25%, you could fund the program for a year.<p>Pretty quickly you&#x27;re going to run into a situation where you&#x27;re cutting a check to everyone, then collecting the money (and more) back in taxes.  And in this case, it&#x27;s terribly inefficient.<p>On a small scale, a program like this probably works well.

He got excessively bored in class as a result and developed a daydreaming habit his teachers didn&#x27;t want to take the time address.  By the time he was in 2nd grade, he was learning nothing and fell behind.  The teachers met with my mom as they usually do and told her that they were just going to pass him to the next class instead of keeping him back.  Mom thought that was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and that was part of what prompted my parents to pull him out and homeschool us.<p>It took her a couple years to break him of the habit (and a lot of one on one interaction).<p>There are probably other things zaphar might know, but that&#x27;s how I remember it.<p>As a result, I never went to public schools at all (with the exception of drivers ed in highschool).  Kindergarten was 30 mins a day for a summer.  I would run up to mom and say &quot;let have school!&quot; and then when i got bored we would stop.<p>For the record, I was socially awkward.  I&#x27;m naturally shy and that didn&#x27;t help.  I eventually overcame that (though it does come out when i&#x27;m more fatigued) and would like to think I can hold my own socially.  But I doubt public school would have been good for me.  If it was anything like college was, I would have done far worse academically. I hate lectures, they make me sleepy and bored and I retain very little.  I need to read and work the problems to understand them.  Mostly, I marvel at the waste of time.  I could typically do all my homework in ~4 hours (or less if i was being diligent) and be done with school by lunch.

And at that point, it becomes an exercise in the government giving people money, then having to get it back via taxes, so then what is the point?  Is it easier to give 10 people $10 or to give 100 people $10, then take $900 of it back?",1423160772

For instance, immutable and lazy languages come crashing down around your ears if even so much as one thing unexpectedly mutates, because the compiler rewrote the order so strongly that even if you think you can second-guess the evaluation order, you&#x27;re wrong. It&#x27;s why &quot;unsafePerformIO&quot; in Haskell is <i>even more</i> dangerous than you might think it is as a novice... it isn&#x27;t just that it violates the ideals of Haskell, it&#x27;s <i>really</i> unsafe! It&#x27;s not an idle comment, it&#x27;s a serious warning. It is possible to use it correctly but it&#x27;s very subtle.<p>&quot;Microservices are an interesting development in this space, providing an architecture within which components with very different underlying semantics may cooperate -- it&#x27;s not a new idea, but neither was AJAX. Other historically significant interoperability initiatives are CORBA, COM, SWIG and GObject.&quot;<p>This is why I qualified my post by assuming you were talking about more than these things, because they exist and aren&#x27;t going anywhere. Fundamentally you can always send a message from a runtime and get a message back in return, but if there&#x27;s any particular problem with that, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s an <i>oversolved</i> problem rather than a not-solved-enough problem; too many choices! But that is not the fault or responsibility of any one language.<p>&quot;The project I work on, Apache Clownfish (a &quot;symbiotic object system&quot;)... Working through issues like how to design an object system which is compatible with diverse GC/allocation schemes is fun and mind-expanding,&quot;<p>And I&#x27;d point out that a quick glance at your project (which I specify so you can correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) makes it appear that I actually already called out all the languages that currently supports (C, Perl, Ruby) [1] as working in the same fundamental regime, <i>before I knew about what you were talking about</i>. It sounds like you&#x27;re working on those accidental complexities, which may well bring great value to many people (and let me highlight that, I&#x27;m serious, this may well be an awesome project, let nothing I&#x27;m saying here be construed as a criticism of the project, its ideas, or its worthiness of being worked on!), but is currently working on C-gray to C-gray interop, which, alas, does little to counter the ideas I&#x27;m discussing here.<p>If you are interested in these ideas, you may find it worth your time to dig into Haskell/GHC a bit and just consider how you might even begin porting your ideas across. By no means would I suggest actually putting any time to code this in, but it might give you a different perspective to think about. If you are feeling less ambitious, even just looking at how you&#x27;d port it to Go, a language still <i>mostly</i> C-gray but with one colorful streak of asynch in it, could be an interesting compare & contrast.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/apache/lucy-clownfish/tree/master/runtime"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/apache/lucy-clownfish/tree/master/runtime</a>",1423160684

This means that compromising just the last step, the people or tools doing the obfuscating, means you can output whatever you want with no-one on the team being able to find it out.<p>The same is true for the CPU design. Created masks are generally not looked at, other than to verify small spots if it seems there are bugs. Because of this, compromising the last step between the model and the mask would allow you to output whatever you want with no-one of the thousands of the people working on it ever finding out.",1423160328

If someone claims to have loaned a bunch of money to me without ever interacting with me, the recovery of that foolish loan should really not be my problem. It would still be bad for an insurance company to expose private information, but there wouldn&#x27;t be such a tremendous incentive to steal, agregate, and distribute this kind of data if there wasn&#x27;t so much easy money in it.<p>Stolen credentials of the kind described in this breach are valuable  largely because there is an asymmetry of effort favoring thieves: it&#x27;s so much easier to borrow money in my name than it is for me prove my innocence that the process of borrowing money with other peoples&#x27; identity can be done in bulk, and to some extent automated.

I understand that deprioritizing interop suits academics because new &quot;colors&quot; are more vivid when they don&#x27;t have to mix with old ones, and also that commercial vendors have an interest in platform lock-in.  But as a working programmer, I&#x27;m not satisfied by that.<p>Microservices are an interesting development in this space, providing an architecture within which components with very different underlying semantics may cooperate -- it&#x27;s not a new idea, but neither was AJAX.  Other historically significant interoperability initiatives are CORBA, COM, SWIG and GObject.<p>Then there are the virtual machines which run multiple programming languages (JVM, CLR, Parrot) -- but it is very hard for a VM to provide a superset of semantics in order to support every last &quot;color&quot; for every supported language.<p>The project I work on, Apache Clownfish (a &quot;symbiotic object system&quot;), takes the opposite approach: instead of aspiring to provide a superset of semantic functionality, it provides a basic subset plus glue, and instead of aspiring to serve as a platform it is distributed as a library.<p>Working through issues like how to design an object system which is compatible with diverse GC/allocation schemes is fun and mind-expanding, and I&#x27;m looking forward to publishing some white papers.  But I wish there was more existing research.

This is because once Flash is uninstalled, the browser will simply report to the website that the user do not having Flash and allow the website to fallback to no-Flash mode accordingly.<p>One biggest problem of having Flash and using Firefox was Vimeo videos because Firefox weren&#x27;t able to play H.264 on its own, and Vimeo do not provide WebM. This is where it used to be the problem. However, fortunately recent Firefox versions now included OpenH264 codec and could play Vimeo videos without any problems.<p>Nowadays there are only handful of sites I need to keep Chromium installed, but the number is rapidly decreasing.

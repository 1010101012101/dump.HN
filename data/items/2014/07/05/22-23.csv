7993226,comment,7992912,7993184,6,0,Partyfists,,,"Of course! The idea behind using preprocessors is helping you write CSS more easily. The goal is not to write obfuscated CSS, but rather to write CSS well! What it really enables (imo) is to think of styling in an Object Oriented way. Whenever you&#x27;re about to write a block of Sass think &quot;What is this thing?&quot;. The answer is almost never a &quot;green button&quot; but rather &quot;getting started button&quot;. Or something like that. It also helps you to think in terms of inheritance:<p>The &quot;getting started button&quot; and &quot;buy button&quot; are both interaction buttons. (Similar buttons, but one is green and the other is yellow).<p>In Sass you represent that this way:\n1. Placeholder %interaction-button class where you outline the fact that it has a border radius, color, and any other shared styling.\n2. A button maker mixin where you put the colors that need to be changed, and any other flags (like has_sub_text: true for the unbold text) and then @extend&#x27;s the placeholder above. \n3. The classes &quot;.buy-button {}&quot; which include the mixin you made.",1404600715
7993225,comment,7992481,7992958,2,0,msandford,,,"Maybe you could do that?<p>I think you&#x27;d be much better off making &quot;hardpoint&quot; bricks where you can slot actual steel or concrete beams.  Monolithic ones, not something that snaps/clips together.<p>One of the reasons that beams work is that they&#x27;re basically unbroken over their length.  If you want to take two halves of beams and bolt that together into a single beam you&#x27;re going to lose strength because the joints are often weaker than the unbroken beam.  Introducing more joints reduces strength a bit further, but the first one is the killer.<p>Ultimately you&#x27;re much better off buying steel beams which are long enough (or too long and cutting them down) and placing them in whole.  Or getting concrete beams pre-cast somewhere and shipped to the site.  Yes they&#x27;re not plug-n-play the way you&#x27;d like.  But the extra materials that it would take to make the click together type of system work will substantially increase costs to the point where you can overrun the labor savings.  The point of this system is that it&#x27;s (theoretically) cheaper.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like saying &quot;well we&#x27;ll just index EVERYTHING on disk and that&#x27;ll make all the queries fast!&quot;  Yeah that might work in some cases but at some point there are diminishing returns to further indexing and if you&#x27;re in a write-heavy enough environment more indexes can actually slow things down.<p>Engineering tradeoffs are everywhere.",1404600706
7993224,comment,7986764,7991852,1,0,wpietri,,,"Thanks for the thoughtful reply.<p>I believe that value is subjective, in that it&#x27;s value to humans, but it&#x27;s not particularly slippery. I also believe that for almost all businesses value creation is separate from cash extraction. My ISP&#x27;s internet connection, for example, delivers a lot of value to me, but getting a bill from them doesn&#x27;t. Google Search delivers a lot of value to me, but having ads on the page often doesn&#x27;t. However, Google Search ads do deliver value to advertisers, and sometimes they deliver value to users when they discover novel products that are helpful to them.<p>I think the value analysis for Sweetch and Monkey Parking is pretty clear. People want to park quickly and easily near wherever they&#x27;re going. Monkey Parking makes that easier for some people, which appears to create value on the per-customer level. But it only does that by making parking harder for other people, so the app delivers no net gain in value. Indeed, by in effect paying people hang out in parking spaces until somebody pays them to leave, they are probably making the parking problem worse, resulting in a net destruction of value.<p>I think the analysis for the restaurant reservation thing is similar. For each person they get in, they are excluding somebody else who would have had a table. Net value gain: zero. Or possibly negative given that squatting on reservations means that some will go unfilled.<p>So in both cases, they seem to be parasites on the actual creators of value. This can be easier to see if you contrast them with the parking startups that do make parking easier: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7986950"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7986950</a>",1404600688

I&#x27;m far more interested in that comparison than with the Lego one.<p>It looks like these blocks have significantly higher material costs than CMUs, require completely different tooling to manufacture, deliver and construct, and apparently needs some kind of robot.<p>In areas that need rapid, cheap and sturdy construction, concrete blocks are pretty proven technology. For example, you&#x27;ll find concrete block housing all over the Caribbean (hell, all over the world) because the structures are relatively cheap to put up, last near enough forever, and stand up extremely well to natural events like hurricanes.<p>They have good thermal properties already, can be filled in with all manner of insulation, conduits, whatever; have excellent compression properties (a great many building foundations are just regular old CMUs). And are easy enough to put a nice looking facade over that most of us would probably have a hard time picking out a concrete block building if he had to.<p>I mean, I get that these don&#x27;t need a welder to work the rebar, or a masonry guy to do the mortar, but you&#x27;ll still need good footing to work off of.

I just want to say, this is awesome and I wish you the best of luck.<p>I am a Developer and I noticed a few really concerning things in your CSS:<p>1. I believe you&#x27;re committing the greatest CSS Sin: Emulating the DOM structure using nesting. Here is one example: &quot;#site-header.newheader nav>ul>li>a.buttonGreen&quot;<p>That CSS Selector should not exist like that. You shouldn&#x27;t be using ids (first) and second this should be be: .buttonGreen {}<p>It looks like bad Sass or LESS is being used and nesting is being abused. If you&#x27;d like more advice on how to fix this I have written many talks.<p>The reason these selectors are a problem is because of the extremely long paint time. Right now your site takes around 30ms to paint. It should be closer to 10ms.<p>2. The CSS classes used are meaningless. Above there&#x27;s a &quot;buttonGreen&quot; class. However, what if you redesign and that button is now blue? Do you just edit the CSS (like should have to be done) Or do you change your HTML and CSS to reflect a basic styling change? This only hurts you and maintaining your site.<p>3. You&#x27;re loading 2.4 MB of data on your home page. 1 MB of that is images, which is fine, but that means you have 1.3 MB of data loading. The good news is that on mobile almost 100% of what you are loading are images, however, that number is still 2 megabytes. I&#x27;d see if there is a way to lower that number.<p>4. It is extremely busy. I was really confused when I got to the site. I am not a good designer so I cannot give specific advice, but I&#x27;d think &quot;calming&quot; the site would help a lot.<p>5. On Chrome Mobile I cannot click the hamburger button. It does nothing.<p>6. You need to simplify your creation flow. You have 4 pages right now, it should only be 1.<p>7. Your select boxes need a dropdown arrow.<p>8. USE NATIVE SELECTS and restyle them using CSS. Use a fallback for IE and IE only!<p>9. Mobile functionality is not the same as desktop functionality, this is a big one that needs to be fixed. You should be able to do the EXACT same things on mobile that you can on desktop.<p>10. The goal of the site should not be browsing, I don&#x27;t think. I think it should be about: Creating lists and sharing lists. Browsing should certainly be an option, but make creation and sharing more prominent than browsing.",1404599329

But in the delivery, it often seemed like the filler language was very loud and more in-depth details were mumbled into the screen.<p>2. I keep wondering &quot;why?&quot;. It was just brushed over in the beginning, but I did not hear a compelling reason being presented on doing everything in Haskell. I do get that it is questionable to build this ever-growing API that does nothing but glue the client (javascript app) and server side to eachother. But isn&#x27;t that what the internet is about? Having contained nodes that communicate?<p>And how is basically automatically generating the same sort of API... but now instead of a growing list of named end points (paths and maybe even GET variables), you have an RPC style protocol that <i>directly adresses the internal code via the tree it sends back as part of the request</i> ... better?<p>Later (around the 48 minute mark) the very valid question is brought up - isn&#x27;t binding UI updates to server interaction very, very expensive? Expensive in such a way that encouraging it as a basic part of the systems design is a bad idea. And the speaker kind of makes a joke of it and says we can just throw more servers at it. Well maybe, but that seems to be a rather substantial error in the entire system design. It might solve some other problem and the problem created may have a simple solution, but... I just don&#x27;t get how all that sums up to being a great idea.<p>3. Is this, in some sense, about avoiding to write an application in javascript? Because I have found a lot of people doing that - building the most incredibly colorful systems only to avoid to finally let go and just build a javascript application already.<p>In this particular instance, it seemed to be about trying - as much as you can - to do everything in Haskell. I have also seen people build frameworks on the idea of writing everything in XML files and interpreting them at runtime in PHP. It&#x27;s possible and you can conjur up advantages, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still not a good idea.<p>Nor is it compelling to other devs to join in, which brings it back to the LISP problem: an incredible potential for flexibility, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s just not very social.

If time and memory are taken into account, you could easily make the case that the world is very much immutable.  For example, if your friend changes his email address, its not as if his old address no longer exists.  Even if it only exists in memory, it still exists somewhere, and you&#x27;re still able to reference it.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this topic, I highly recommend Rich Hickey&#x27;s talk &quot;The Value of Values&quot;[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values</a>.",1404597986

Sure :) We&#x27;re basicly two founders that have done most of the design and project management of the site. In addition, we&#x27;ve outsourced some design and all of the programming to Ukraine, including the mobile version. The outsourced development itself runs into the 100k&#x27;s over the stretch of 1.5 years, and in addition, we&#x27;ve done some marketing (40-50k) and had some administrative costs (lawyers, offices, etc.). I don&#x27;t have an exact sum, but it&#x27;s anywhere from 190-220k.<p>I&#x27;m a designer and previous developer myself, but the site is actually quite broad. There is a lot more than meets the eye, such as: \n- an administration area\n- caching and indexing mechanisms\n- web scraping robots\n- various other agents and robots to update user feeds, top lists, etc. \n- algorithms to calculate relevance and weight for the items on each list\n- Wordpress plugins, possibility to embed lists, etc. \n...and so forth.

It had to have other elements to it (such as being written by one of the greatest Russian authors, provoking unconventional thought, etc. -- obviously banned garbage would have remained garbage).

Because a modern tech company can&#x27;t really <i>execute</i> 20 years ahead. 20 years is an eternity in technology. In 20 years the world will be <i>nothing</i> like what you <i>thought</i> it would be, and everything you thought would be cool to build up to would already be obsolete.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about Google X&#x27;s &quot;moonshot&quot; efforts, can those efforts succeed?

Startups that follow the opposite scenario often die because they're little more than academic labs, and no one will pay for what they're doing.",1222851583

The across-the-world aspect of some outsourcing seems like it could be a benefit.<p>Code reviews can bottleneck development, so I was thinking it'd be nice if I could just commit at end of day... Then in the morning, I'd come in to an email box magically full of corrections, criticisms, etc.<p>When I think of the big worries I have about outsourced development, schedule risk, quality risk, and the miscommunication burdens.  They all seem to be mitigated by just doing reviews.  If they can't review well in a reasonably timely manner (strong preference for a day), just quit using them.  No major loss.  If the code isn't understandable, there's a real benefit to improving it... it's not just a burden imposed by the process.<p>Has anyone tried this?  What issues did you / might you run into?<p>Are there companies I could approach about hiring them to do it?  I'm happy to pay up for such a service because if it works well it could make me dramatically more productive.<p>Am I missing something that makes this obviously a stupid idea?",1222851305

320518,comment,320513,320515,0,0,eries,,,"Yes, absolutely. We didn't even formalize titles until we were in the 10-20 people range. I served as both CTO and VP Eng until the company was about 65 people, and it was starting to strain but was not a total disaster.",1222851189
320517,comment,320355,320355,0,0,zaidf,,,"This is only from MY personal experience: I have found that I take criticism more negatively for projects I am myself not fully convinced about.<p>My advice: fully be sold on your idea before inviting outside opinions. Otherwise outside opinion, especially negative, is just an EXCUSE to drop an idea you were never convinced about yourself.<p>Talk is cheap. Don't seek validation of your idea from others. Except of course when they are people that matter(and there are limits to that too). ie. VCs, potential cofounders.",1222851136
320516,comment,319582,320224,0,0,abijlani,,,"The interest rate is not tied to the amount of money available for lending but the amount of lenders out the there. So if there a huge demand for loans the interest rate goes up to counter balance the demand.<p>With the economy tanking and the money tightening if they raised the interest rates, nobody would borrow and the situation would get even worse.",1222851062

320514,comment,318595,319595,0,0,m_eiman,,,"Sure, but it would be different from the one we have now. Things might be moving slower, but crashes should be less frequent.<p>The main difference is that that system isn't built on the assumption that the economy will always expand, which the current system is. I'll leave it to someone who actually knows something about the pros and cons of each to tell you if that's good or bad.. But basic reasoning tells me that it's not likely that something that takes place in a fixed environment (Earth) can expand for ever.",1222850925

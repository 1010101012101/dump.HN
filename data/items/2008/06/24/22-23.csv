226922,comment,226657,226657,0,0,Goladus,,,"Why is WoW successful?<p>(1) They started with the successful and highly addictive Everquest format.<p>(2) They used a small number of classes, carefully and creatively allocating abilities to each one in order to make that class <i>fun to play</i>: either solo or in a group.  They also tweaked the mana/melee balance to be more flexible and interesting and combat was generally faster paced than in other MMORPGs.<p>(3) They set the bar for failure lower, and the penalty for failure was less punishing.  This encouraged less-hardcore players to experiment more and try different things, rather than always sticking to the safest tactic.<p>(4) They designed for PvP from the start.<p>(2) + (3) + (4) = Replayability.  People log in to play WoW because it's <i>fun to play</i> not just because they want to hit the next level.<p>(5) They used frequent, incremental rewards so that players logged out always having felt as if they accomplished something.<p>(6) They started with a huge Warcraft fanbase, and marketed to their audience with hip, exiting videos and information.<p>(7) They kept system requirements LOW.  They focused on getting realism through animations and colorful symbolism rather than high poly counts.  They avoided the ""uncanny valley"" of character models while delivering a game that players could play on the hardware they already owned.<p>(8) They marketed the game worldwide.<p>(9) The game loads quickly, once it's patched.  You can decide you want to play WoW and be online in a minute or so.  (Others may be better now, but when WoW came out EQ took 5-10 minutes from desktop to spawning in-game)<p>(10) Instanced content made it easy to avoid the more annoying social aspects of an MMORPG.  Fighting for spawns was fun in EQ, but that's not needed in WoW because the combat engine is better.",1214347465

226919,comment,226824,226824,0,0,rjett,,,"This article seems more like PR on behalf of Doostang than it is an analysis of the business models of Doostang or LinkedIn. The HN community seems to occasionally discuss LinkedIn, but I have yet to read any analysis/ discussion on Doostang. Does anyone out there use Doostang or know anything about their business model? \n  I was invited to join about 9 months ago, but soon found the site to be not quite as elite as they professed due to the fact that I was expected to spam my friends with Doostang invites in order to gain access to other parts of the site. This was quite annoying and I quickly dismissed Doostang as illegitimate. Thoughts on the Doostang model?",1214347344

226907,comment,226657,226657,0,0,subwindow,,,"Having spent half of the past 10 years addicted to MMO's, I can tell you:<p>Addiction via immersion and frequent incremental rewards.<p>One: you immerse the user in the game environment so that all of their attention is focused on the game world.<p>Two: using that focus, you provide a system wherein there is the constant availability of incremental rewards.  In games like WoW, every single minute spent goes toward achieving a specific incremental reward.  You kill a monster: you get a reward (loot + experience), you go to the nearest town: you get new quests.  The key is to have a near-term action (< 5 minutes) available to the user at ALL TIMES where they can achieve some kind of small reward.  Larger incremental rewards (levels, skills, raids) are available to keep attention once the smaller rewards become rote.<p>Look at anything that's ever been called addictive- not just video games.  I bet that they share these two traits, and their addictiveness is directly proportional to how well they accomplish these goals.<p>Can these be applied to a facebook app? Maybe.  Would you look sleazy trying to do it with a facebook app?  Definitely.",1214345782

Here's something Raph Koster recorded Rob Pardo (Blizzard VP) saying at a conference once. I thought it was good:<p>""The Blizzard polish. Polish is the word associated with us in reviews. There’s this big assumption that polish is something you do in the end. That we’re successful because we spend 6-12 months at the end polishing. We do get more time, but we do the polish right from the beginning. It’s a constant effort. You have to have a culture of polish. Everyone has to be bought into it and you have to constantly preach it. if you leave it to the end, it’ll be more difficult.<p>You’ll get a lot of “why does it matter that this feature is polished?

At lower speeds the car feels much lighter, every input you put simply gives you instant feedback making the controls feel even more tactile, almost like riding a bike.<p>You can not compare electric to driving a gasoline with automatic, those still suffer from all the mechanical delays and are imo worse with regards to this as the delay of a gearshift can come at unpredictable times.",1430801979

If you start on Lexapro/Prozac/Paxil, and it works great, but after six months you start to feel like it&#x27;s not as effective, definitely talk to your doctor about looking at different meds, even other SSRI&#x27;s.  There are subtle differences in how they work that can make a difference (I&#x27;m not a doctor or bio guy, but they affect different receptors differently, even when they are primarily aimed at serotonin).  Depression isn&#x27;t a monolithic problem (it feels like it, but there can be multiple factors feeding into it), so as you do the talk therapy and the drugs your equilibrium between maladaptive cognitions, chemical imbalances, relationship and work patterns, etc. can shift, just be aware of how you&#x27;re feeling (and if differently, how) and keep your doctor apprised.  Also, therapy can be intimidating because you&#x27;re talking about problems that feel insurmountable while you&#x27;re depressed--but just spill it; they get less insurmountable once you&#x27;ve expressed them.  Sometimes just hearing yourself say something out loud can make it obvious what the issue is, or how you could look at it differently.<p>Good luck, it&#x27;s worth the effort.

LogCabin was initially created for use with RAMCloud ( <a href=""http://ramcloud.stanford.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ramcloud.stanford.edu</a> ), which mostly hand-rolls its RPC serialization to achieve its extreme performance goals (it budgets about 1 microsecond in software overhead per RPC). I thought I was being user-friendly in LogCabin by using protobufs, and at the time, something as embarrassingly slow as HTTP+JSON was unthinkable. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too late to add a REST API to LogCabin, and it&#x27;d be pretty easy to make a REST proxy. Maybe that&#x27;s worth doing for easier adoption from other languages.

That&#x27;s certainly how my businesses operate.<p>Sadly, reading sites frequented by the start-up community, including HN, taught me long ago that plenty of entrepreneurial types will feel absolutely no guilt about skipping things like security and privacy safeguards if it gets them significantly more/quicker money. They just hope that they will be able to handle any PR fall-out if it ever becomes necessary, and it&#x27;s one more risk to manage, nothing more.<p>If something really bad happens, their back-up plan is simply to fold the business and start a new one. They&#x27;ll write off the loss without much regard to the customers who had supported them or any damage that might be caused to those customers by the leakage of that sensitive information. In short, your second characterisation is all too realistic.<p>I think this is almost inevitable as long as the start-up culture is focussed around either having an outside shot at being the next Google/Facebook/Apple, having a realistic chance of being acquired by the current Google/Facebook/Apple within a fairly short period, or throwing it all away and starting again. By its nature, this business attracts gamblers. Lacking any meaningful penalty for not taking proper precautions, not just for the start-up but also for the founders/leadership of the start-up and their investors, the odds are more in favour of those who cut corners. Looking out for your customers can even be a direct competitive disadvantage.<p>To change the culture, you need to change the attitude of either the founders or the funders. The former would take something like piercing the corporate shield and making the officers of a company personally responsible for negligent data leaks, probably not just in monetary terms but also something they can&#x27;t shake like barring them from being officers of any other company for some significant period afterwards (thus killing the dump-it-and-start-over strategy). The latter just needs a direct financial penalty severe enough to make cutting the corners at the risk of user data not a good bet, which in practice is probably much easier to achieve, and without the negative side effect of making honest but nervous founders more reluctant to take a risk on starting a business.",1430799112

2248064,story,,,2,1,AllahJesus,"Redefining Digital Imaging. Is it a hardware issue, a software issue or both?",,"Nowadays with digital photography and imaging consumers and manufacturers are in a mega-pixel craze. The next best thing always has more resolution crammed into the same space for a higher quality image. And then the bells and whistles kick in with the ability to record audio/video, lcd touch screens, a flash, zoom capability and the works. However, in most senses, the technology is the same. It's light that gets captured as a certain color within a certain position in the view of the lens, which then gets converted to a pixel of an image that gets converted into some sort of raster technology like the JPEG.<p>But what if I wanted to say, ""locate the red VW Jetta""? The camera has no understanding of what that is. The camera doesn't know Johnathan from Natalia, even though we do. I think we're moving into a time where the consumer will want that. Just as they are able voice activate their Ford Fusion and tell it what song to play, or to check their Facebook page, I don't think that wanting the camera to be able to distinguish one object from another and then appropriately capture it is far behind.<p>How do we do that? How do we develop an imaging system that works similar to the human brain in a way such that it can distinguish the difference between two people after being given the definition of them? Or between two cars, or even just two colors to start. I say ""photograph the blue ball"" and it focuses heavily on that in the image and puts the red ball out of focus.<p>Is that a hardware issue? Do we have to develop an entirely new way of capturing images that isn't based on pixels and raster technology? Is it just a software issue and we need to develop better software to reach that type of interaction with our imaging equipment?<p>The best example I can think of visually is Iron Man 2 -- the inside interface within the suit helmet. I know it's all CGI, but the way the software was able to scan the screen and distinguish people from objects, weapons from non-weapons, and threats from non threats is the type of ability I'm speaking of.<p>I'm just sort of thinking out lout here...<p>Any thoughts?",1298335610

These things are experienced to some extent via examples that accompany the theory, and to a greater extent via reading around the subject and experimentation where the course has provided enough context to direct the student's personal study.<p>IMHO, one of the major differences between good and bad courses is that those that are taught well will also encourage the student to explore useful applications for what they are learning in this way, and thus to experience not only the practical implications of what they are learning but also the surrounding tools, processes and techniques that go with them in the real world.<p>Someone with a broad foundation in the theory and experience of varied practical applications should have no difficult adapting to other applications the same theory, nor to newer theories that have evolved through industrial R&D and not yet made it back into academia. Whether a recruitment process is any good at recognising this important ability to adapt and learn independently is an entirely different question, but any remotely useful process should be able to weed out the people who managed to spend 3-4 years studying theory without experimenting practically and reading around their subject, and avoiding hiring those is one of the most important basic goals of any software developer recruitment exercise IME.",1298335230

I wrote a web app for collaborative translation of classical Japanese texts for one my courses and it was a complete success (a book partly produced by the program via a TeX template will soon be release). I also wrote several other web apps, for dictionaries and handwriting recognition, for example. One thing I usually hear from teachers and other students is that they love these programs, but have no idea how to get them. They usually don't want to learn programming themselves, but would like to have someone who can program something simple if they tell them to. Maybe this problem is restricted to my case (German University of Tübingen), but there is no one here in the faculty (of the Asian studies department) who could teach simple programming, or even state why it is needed. Instead, I have seen people ignoring technological helpers (morphological parsers, programming languages like Perl, Python or Ruby) because they are ""too complicated"". These people will still do everything by hand (or sometimes with word macros) that could be done by a simple program, and will waste months of time.<p>Another aspect I like about introducing programming to the humanities is that it can act as a grounding element to the sometimes lofty ideas that people tend to have. A lot of things in the humanities (like the interpretation of a medieval Japanese texts) seem extremely vague, but are actually only extremely complicated.

Maybe not most, but even a small percentage means hundreds of thousands of people, and <i>tons</i> of kids who have no choice in the matter.<p>><i>it removes the will to be cured</i><p>Absolutely, that's why it's such a hard thing to fix.  And drugs are a fantastic way to crack your way out of it, to break that relentless loop.  And our current culture sneers at anyone (particularly men) seeking help to solve personal problems.  <i>That</i> needs to change.  It is, slightly, thankfully, but there's a <i>very</i> long way to go.<p>I take no issue with medicating.  Only over-medicating.  And neurochemical-manipulating drugs have been <i>crammed</i> down America's collective throat for a while now, without long-term trials, frequently with barely-detectable improvements over sugar pills (and later studies showing none or <i>worse</i>), and without really understanding what they're doing or their ramifications.<p>Not that I think that's surprising.  It's a powerful, successful-enough new line of treatment that's helping a lot of people, and exposing a lot of existing problems that are now getting treated.  Of course such a thing would be used before long-term trials were run.  People would take it voluntarily - the immediate almost always out-weighs the long-term in any creature, but it's entirely founded when the immediate threatens your life.<p>The problem I find with the current everyone-<i>must</i>-be-happy trend (as nice as it would be to achieve) is that a) it adds <i>more</i> weight against those who are unhappy to conceal their problems rather than publicly seek help, as everyone else is clearly happy (ignoring the truth) and they don't want to cause unhappiness, and b) it has lead to over-prescribing short-term (in that they work quickly, not that they don't continue to work - that's debatable and essentially unknown currently) solutions, when the <i>causes</i> are the real demons that must be exorcised.  It is <i>masking</i> the problems because people quit dealing with them because a fast way out is a doctor's visit and a complaint away.  Which is their fault for being lazy, but that's human (and efficient), and it shouldn't be <i>that</i> readily handed out or advertised as a magic bullet.<p>It also doesn't help that hyperactivity drugs have been pushed by <i>elementary schools</i> (or individual teachers) for unruly kids when it's far more likely that they are bored or weren't raised properly.  But that's a rant about our education system, which (especially at elementary levels) I feel is fundamentally, <i>enormously</i> flawed and contributing to a lot of problems.  I won't go further on that.<p>What needs to be done is to treat the imminent danger, and then <i>immediately</i> work with people to solve the causes.  But that's cross-discipline - medication and (essentially) psychotherapy - thus rare in a single person, and because the initial danger is gone <i>people quit trying</i>.  It <i>appears</i> to be a solution, without actually being one, and long-term / long-term-use side-effects are very real and very dangerous, and largely unknown.  One of which I do feel is that it teaches people to medicate their problems instead of dealing with them directly.  It's encouraging people to take fast exits.<p>---<p>Anecdote time!  I had a couple years of depression a while back, and didn't take anything for it.

Thus it has been drowning under the weight of its own hype for so long that it no longer really means anything.<p>I'm sure a lot of practices that are commonly considered Agile have genuine merit. Indeed, good developers have been using many of these practices since long before anyone started naming them. Equally, bad developers probably won't adopt them whatever they are called.<p>Other practices that tend to get bundled into various specific Agile processes are, IMNSHO, 100% pure snake oil. After so many years, they have a pretty poor track record, when surely they should be dominating the software development field by now if they were as effective as their advocates claim and everyone else is doing such horrible things.<p>I always find it rather ironic that despite the basic tenet of the Agile Manifesto that individuals and interactions are more valuable than processes or tools, we still have consultants and authors pushing processes like XP or Scrum or whatever the next one is, almost invariably using all-or-nothing arguments about how you need to use all the components of their favourite buzzword method or it just doesn't work, and if you don't and your project fails then that must be why.<p>What would I do differently next time, in the sense of promoting what actually works and not some diluted buzzword bingo entry? I'd single out individual elements, such as using shorter iterations or emphasizing ongoing communication with a client over formal up-front specifications. I would describe them in plain English, I would consider their merits and risks individually, and perhaps I would consider how some of them interact. But above all, I would not artificially bundle up a whole bunch of distinct ideas that can be understood perfectly well in isolation (whether or not they are actually effective) and create some artificial super-idea and a black-and-white approach to using it.<p>And I'd execute anyone who started naming practices, overall processes, or the roles within those processes in a way that would make anyone outside the Kool-Aid drinkers burst out laughing.",1298334083

Simple price fixing in an otherwise private healthcare market. In return, Japanese doctors and hospitals (FYI, there are more private hospitals in Japan than the US) are allowed to set whatever prices for ancillary services (like private or semi-private rooms) that they want. BTW, the average stay overnight in a private room at a Japanese hospital is about $100. An MRI (which was 1400 negotiated down to 700 FTA) is $98, due largely to the fact that the Japanese have more MRIs and CT scanners per capita than the US. I mean, wasn't technology supposed to be our superiority play?<p>And, if you want to talk care and outcomes, let's pick the most grim of diagnostics: Cancer. Japan's 5-year survival rates are among the highest in the world, and the highest in particular cancers such as colon and rectal cancer. And, FYI, the US isn't #1 in survival rates for all cancers. It's spread evenly through the G8.<p>And, the most free of supposed free markets and tax-friendly wonderlands, Singapore, also puts price controls on procedures, with similarly successful outcomes. So it isn't a cultural or ""economic"" thing, it's a government thing. It always will be. An adult just needs to come in, put their foot down similar to what Tommy Douglas did in Canada, and declare either we all buy in to a government-run healthcare system, or we buy in to the government completely regulating the market much like it does the stock market or agricultural industry.

I may be misunderstanding how the law works, but isn't it true that group coverage can deny pre-existing conditions only for a limited time (6 months)?<p>In California you need at least 2 employees to qualify for group coverage. So you start an actual company, perform business (presumably turning in some money to cover your costs), and also get coverage for your dependents. There's one caveat that the coverage does not start until your company has been around for 6 months (unrelated to the pre-existing 6 months figure above.)<p>Or was the author's post related to (presumably) retiring earlier and specifically not wanting to start a company again?",1298333215

The UK already has sky-high taxation on tobacco. I rather like the idea of the Fat Tax as well.<p>Placing a tax on fat content would increase the proportion of earnings used for the NHS by those who would use it the most. It would also provide a disincentive to eat unhealthy in the first place. Of course, many many people think this smells a lot like social engineering (what isn't at government level?), so this wouldn't pass in the UK, let alone the US.<p>Lots of good background on Fat Tax in the References at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_tax</a>",1298332814

They provide a unique identifier, which used in conjunction with an API call, with operate on the data in, or the meta data of a data set.<p>And while its true that UNIX (and taken to its logical extreme Plan 9) used a common API to handle all of the transfers between non-memory resident data sets and memory, there are many examples of operating systems that use other schemes. One of my favorites which I got to help build when I was in the kernel group at Sun was a thing called 'mmap' which assigned addresses in your memory space to locations on disk. The 'magic' happened in the VM HAT layer. That scheme is having something of a comeback in 64 bit address processors since few machines actually have 22PB of RAM it is possible to do something like:<p><pre><code>    struct Stuff *my_stuff;\n    mmap((void *)my_stuff, file_len, 0, 0, file, 0);\n</code></pre>\nAnd then be able to make a statement<p><pre><code>    if ((my_stuff+100)->is_ready) { ... }\n </code></pre>\nAnd have the operating system translate between my notion of  a memory address and the data sets offset to instance 100 of the structures contained therein.<p>I expect to see more of that in experimental OS code. Something like char <i>data_file = ChuckOSOpen(""some.dat"");\nwhich lets me then address data_file like an array of char so<p><pre><code>   while (char *t = data_file, IsValid(t), t++) { ... }; \n</code></pre>\nwould then iterate over the contents of data_file as 8 bit values until there wasn't any more data and thus no more validly mapped pages. Read and write are simply assignment, seek is simply math, and close is simply unmap.<p>All without the notion of 'files' but with a notion of 'named data sets' which clearly can be implemented in a number of ways.",1341024668

The camera is what Google is pitching very heavily right now. I'd guess they're doing that because it's something people can relate to... taking pictures from your perspective, taking them without putting some device between you and your subject. The tiny camera that takes pictures from your eye level is a big enough draw to get early users interested. (The killer app is ""real-life"" DVR... why should you have to stick your camera phone in front of your face to take a picture or record a video... how many times have you thought ""damn... if I just would have had my phone ready I could have grabbed an awesome shot"").<p>The display is harder to understand. What information do you need in front of your eyes right now that actually helps you? Today you might check Yelp for a restaurant review or Google Maps for directions, but you rarely ever keep your phone in front of your face while you walk through New York... it's a reference, not a constant aide. It's a cool idea but most people (even some of the geeky ones who visit Hacker News) don't see the value.<p>I think the big vision here is that you'll have a camera that consumes the world around you and a system that can process what the camera is seeing, and give you real useful information about the world around you immediately. You walk into the office and the system tells you that you're looking at ""Sarah"" and you have a meeting with her at 3pm, or that the menu item you're looking at has 615 calories and most people who order it love it, or that the product you're about to buy is $50 cheaper at an online store and can be shipped to you in 2 days.

As Amazon did with its Fire, Google is selling the Nexus 7 at cost. Amazon could afford to do so because the Fire is a gateway to its online store. After you get the Fire, youll buy a lot of books and movies from Amazon, and you might even become a subscriber to Prime, Amazons highly profitable subscription service.<p>But Google, unlike Amazon, doesnt sell physical stuff, so it cant justify the low price of the Nexus 7 on the expectation of huge e-commerce sales. Sure, the search company does sell mediayou can buy books, music, and subscribe to magazines from the Nexus, but the selection is thin compared with whats available in Amazon or Apples media stores. If you get a Nexus 7, youre better off relying on other sources for media. For books, install the Kindle app and buy from Amazon. For movies, use the Netflix app. For music, use Spotify.<p>Well, what about advertising? Google makes most of its money from ads, and boosting advertising revenue is the central goal behind Android. The more Android devices Google sells, the more people use its services, and thus, the more people see its ads. So if Google sells a lot of Nexus 7s, couldnt it make a lot more money from ads?<p>Not really. Google makes only about $4 per year in ad revenue from every Android device, according to an analysis by Asymcos Horace Dediu. So if Google sells 10 million Nexus 7sfar more than anyone expectsit would make $40 million a year from the device. For a company that made nearly $12 billion in profits last year, thats nothing to crow about. (Whats more, two-thirds of Googles mobile advertising revenue comes through Apple devices. If people choose the Nexus 7 over the iPad, Google might not be making any more money than it would have anyway.)<p>Googles real goal with the Nexus 7 cant be to make money. Instead, the tablet is a marketing device. Google wants to hop on the tablet train before its too late. Its been two years since the iPad was released, and so far no one has managed to create a plausible alternative. The Nexus 7 is an effort to get people to believe that Android tablets arent terrible. Its good enough to be usable for most people, and just cheap enough to get a lot of folks to give it a try. And if you get the Nexus 7 and find that it isnt so bad, maybe one day youll be willing to give other, not-so-cheap Android tablets a try.<p>Its a circuitous plan, and it could well fail. In the meantime, though, you might as well enjoy Googles pretty good, cheap tablet.""",1341023683

It doesn't get in your way, and it won't have any performance issues.  On the other hand, it doesn't hold your hand, and it doesn't help you solve any especially hard problems.  A simple demo app tends to look very clean when implemented in Backbone, but anything more complicated will require you to write a <i>TON</i> of code.  (By design; Backbone only provides functionality that everyone will need, regardless of the type of project.)<p>The other two you listed are heavier, and more opinionated.  They will do a lot more to help you, <i>if</i> you're working the way they think you'll work.  If you aren't, they can be counter-productive; it's not hard to miscode something to get a major performance penalty.<p>I evaluated every framework I could get my hands on, and settled on Knockout.  It's quite similar to AngularJS and Ember, but feels more mature than either, and has great documentation.  Its killer feature is it's two way bindings between the DOM and the JS models.<p>My project is basically a very complex CRUD app; I've got tons of complex, deeply nested records I need to display and let users edit; a good, fast, clean UI for doing so is crucial.  My initial spike using Backbone bogged down in endless boilerplate to try and keep everything in sync, and tons of ugly JQuery code to manipulate the DOM.  (And was buggy to boot, which I'm sure was my fault, but highlights that Backbone can have a somewhat rough learning curve.)  Knockout, however, made it a snap.  My code was shorter, cleaner, easier to write and maintain, and fast.<p>So, my suggestion:  Backbone if you're comfortable with writing all the functionality you need from scratch, and just want a little structure for your app.  On the other hand, if you want a very robust framework for writing CRUD apps with a rich UI, and want to make your life easy, go with Knockout.<p>(Ember and Angular are good too, but in my view they're too similar to Knockout.  There's just no compelling reason to choose them, given that Knockout is more mature and polished.)",1341023400

If you're just starting you have no such investment and you're better off learning another language which is both easier to learn and more productive.",1341022984

I feel it's perfect for smaller projects where separation of logic isn't as important. Angular has the ability to grow in complexity if you need it too.<p>Backbone comes with a lot of boilerplate, but honestly is worth it if you have a larger front end app. Being able to have your data trickle though your models and views in a concise structured way can make changes as well as fixes much easier in the long run. Backbone's persistence functionality is pretty phenomenal as well.<p>Ember relies pretty heavily on Handlebars. If you're game to use that for your client side rendering than it could be a good option. Ember looks similar to Backbone but makes a few things easier such as computed properties and bidirectional bindings. I haven't touched it much yet as I'm currently working in Backbone and Ember's current lack of an ""official"" persistence mechanism turned me off a bit.<p>All three of these are great frameworks.

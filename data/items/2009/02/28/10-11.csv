They are hard and a lot of work.</i><p>If you read that link carefully, you'll note that I didn't say anything about promotion being easy -- and in any case, the scare quotes in ""that's all ""easy"" stuff"" should have been a tip-off that I didn't really mean that everything I mentioned would be easy.  I was effecting the mathematician's habit of referring to any solved problem as ""trivial"" -- for all that there's a lot of work involved in creating a GUI, porting software to Windows, et cetera, those are all things which people have done in the past, whereas the core functionality of tarsnap -- secure snapshotted online backup -- required solving entirely new problems.",1235818190

While Chicago does have it's share of great restaurants, a decent music scene and pretty good art scene.  It suffers from a chronic second city mentality, which is--It's a pretty good city for being in the Mid-West, but if you're really good at something go to a first rate city liky New York, LA or San Fran.  In 7 years, every really talented theater group, actor, artist or musician I knew ended up having to move to either New York or to California.  There just wasn't enough going on to sustain those people in Chicago.<p>Chicago also has a <i>huge</i> meathead/jock culture.  Just walk within 3 blocks of the bar district along Rush and Division on a weekend night.  I'm 6'7"" tall, 300 pounds, and I often worried about some drunk meathead picking a fight with me.  All that to say, that it's not a really nerd friendly town.<p>If you do move there and you walk around at night, get a black leather jacket preferably with Chicago PD patches sown on it.  (The Alley on Belmont and Clark sells them).  Walk around with your right hand tucked under your left armpit.  You'll look like you're packing heat, and the thugs/meatheads will leave you alone.  At least that worked for me for several years.<p>Oh, and the winters really suck.<p>Say what you will, I can think of a half a dozen other cities I'd rather bootstrap in--Austin, Boston, Providence, New York, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, Toronto, Boulder, San Diego.",1235816861

498131,comment,497951,498120,0,0,herdrick,,,"I think by the time the Wufooers moved back to Tampa they knew more about doing a startup than you do.  That's partly due to their YC experience and partly because they really know and obsess about design and user experience.  (There's a lot of overlap there.)  Spending time around people in Silicon Valley who talk about those two things a lot would help you in that department.  And promotion.  And marketing.<p>Maybe you shouldn't listen to me since I've recently failed.  But please do change some things you are doing, at least in the design area.  I'd like to see you do well.",1235816099
498130,comment,494943,496726,0,0,dejb,,,"Good to see that you put in the effort to back up your claims. Despite the fact that your other claim was misrepresented (I'll reply to that separately) I'll take you at your word that this instance is as stated.<p>Your original statement implied to me that this was a common occurance rather than a single case. Anyone can cherry pick individual cases that might look bad against any group of people. I'd be amused to see what 'Global warming sceptics-sceptics' could dig up ubout individual sceptics.<p>To actually count this as evidence againt the global warming case in general you would have to show that scientists who suport the global warming case are generally a lot less forthcoming with their data than other comparable areas (or with sceptics if there was a statistically valid sample group of recognised scientists in that group).<p>I'm not saying scientist are perfect. But compared with the motley crew of inferentially challenged global warming sceptics I have experienced I would back them any day. And really that's what it comes down to. Nothing is an absolute certainly. We all individually and collectively have to make decisions based on probablilities. Nothing you have said provides any sort of evidence that I should trust the scientific consensus any less than for any other issue.",1235816015

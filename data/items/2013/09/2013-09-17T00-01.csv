It&#x27;s a shame, because there are still some very good books being produced with the O&#x27;Reilly name on them, but no longer can I trust them to be good because there&#x27;s an animal on the cover.<p>The worst book I have bought in the past two years was O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Building Node Applications with MongoDB and Backbone.<p>My quick, capsule review of that book:  Piece of Shit.  Bad example code, horrific continuity, next to no editing, it had everything needed to be lumped in with the crappy tech books.  Ironically, the &quot;Sam&#x27;s Teach Yourself&quot; Node.js book (which I had already gone through and was hoping to expand upon with the O&#x27;Reilly purchase) was vastly superior.<p>I wish I could get my money back, but I don&#x27;t think Amazon does refunds for ebooks.",1379379551

When I say average Joe I was probably understating things - I&#x27;m talking about your rational, generally college educated, sentient being.

When I say general knowledge of finance I mean more specifically trading savy - types of trading (trend, value...etc), ways to trade (short, long, margin, leverage), ..etc.  And when I say domain knowledge I mean generally the domain the person works in and can pick a winner from a loser.<p>Now with that knowledge, the fact that a small investor can make small moves and not effect the security itself, and subtracting management fees, you mean to tell me just because a finance company puts their stamp on a mutual fund that means they&#x27;ll do better than me?<p>My returns and the returns of folks I know that fit that characterization disagree with you.",1379379291

Obviously the current implementation of patents has numerous downsides.  The costs are high.  But what are the benefits?  If they even slightly outweigh the costs, then having patents is better than not having them.  And regardless of the cost/benefit ratio, is there a better implementation of the idea?<p>The intention behind patents is clearly a good idea.  Who can argue with fostering innovation in a way that requires open publication?  (Open source your idea, receive profits!)  If anything, software patents are even more important than other kinds, in this age of the cloud and web services where there are no physical artifacts that can be taken apart and studied.  We can take apart a cotton gin, but we can&#x27;t see Google&#x27;s source code.  At least we get the PageRank patent.<p>There is less need in software for the monopoly benefit, and more need for open publication requirement.

You need to make a <i>lot</i> of money (or be really lucky in the stock market) to have a 66% savings rate lead to any sort of real retirement in 10 years.<p>Say I make $100k gross per year.  That&#x27;s a very nice salary for a new grad engineer -- the kind of person who might take this ten-year-retirement advice to heart.  Roughly 1/3 of that income goes to taxes, so I&#x27;m actually taking home $66k per year.  If I save 66% of <i>that</i>, I&#x27;m saving ~$44k per year.  These numbers can shift a little depending on where you live, how you save, etc., but they&#x27;re not going to change by a huge amount.<p>Multiply that $44k by 10 years, and you&#x27;re not even at half a million dollars.  That&#x27;s not retirement money (unless perhaps your &quot;retirement&quot; is to continue to live off of $20k/year indefinitely and die young from eating too much ramen).<p>The other half of the equation is finding investments that return a reasonable yield without betting the farm on timeframes <= 10 years.

6396818,comment,6396174,6396174,15,0,adamtj,,,"I find it hard to reconcile the idea that courts provide justice with the extremely high cost to the interested parties.<p>I see nothing inherently wrong with being a patent &quot;troll&quot;.  The idea behind patents is to provide financial incentives to innovation.  A little guy with a legitimate patent may have difficulty convincing large corporations to pay a license fee.  One way for such a person to reap that benefit is to sell the patent to a holding company that does the work of monetizing the patent.  Or to seek settlements and avoid long legal battles that he or she may not have the resources to endure.  Patent &quot;trolls&quot; are just the market at work, and that is normally a good thing.<p>The problem is, the high cost of litigation makes it a very easy system to abuse.  That high cost imbues patents with a substantial value regardless of their merit.  It&#x27;s very easy to disagree about whether a patent applies in a particular situation, or is even valid generally, but very costly to resolve such disagreements.<p>Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t just shift the cost burden to the trolls, because then you also have to stick the little guy with the cost of sueing a giant multinational corporation for any wrongdoing.  It&#x27;s hard enough as is.  It may seem easy to tell the difference between those situations, but it&#x27;s difficult to encode those ideas in laws that apply universally.  Other solutions tend to have similar problems.  This RICO thing could potentially affect future class action suits against Big Evil.<p>My point, I guess, is this: the real problem isn&#x27;t the &quot;trolls&quot; but the high cost of justice.  Short of eliminating patents, to attack the problem from any direction other than the cost of justice tends to turn it into the same sort of thing as pornographers and free speech.  You can&#x27;t easily attack patent trolls or pornographers without damaging other users of the courts or of free speech.",1379377345

They have already out-stripped us spectacularly. You can&#x27;t compete with them once you give them the tools that allow them to participate in the creation of the experiences that they find are valuable. And it&#x27;s not by a little bit; it&#x27;s like an order of magnitude more productive already, and we&#x27;re only a couple of years into thinking about how to do that.<p>[...]<p>The point is that the connected groups of users are going to be way more successful if they&#x27;re properly enabled and supported than any of the individual game developers are going to be.<p>But, there&#x27;s this huge tension between, if that&#x27;s the direction that gaming is going, or if that&#x27;s the direction content creation is going, these other systems actually put a tremendous number of road-blocks in the way of doing that.<p>It takes Valve several months to get through certification process for a single update. I mean, it took us 6 months to get one update through the Apple Store to ship an iPad update. We have a lot of resources and have a huge commercial motivation. No individual user, if they&#x27;re the sort of center of gravity for content production, is going to have the wherewithal or the stubbornness to get through that.<p>That&#x27;s just one example of the many ways that the closed systems appear to us to be antithetical to our user-centric model of content production, going forward.&quot;<p>--<p>Like you, I&#x27;m just trying to &quot;read the tea leaves&quot; here, but the future is user-generated content. Valve needs to leverage that by offering a hardware platform [2] that will allow them to be in complete and full control, both technologically and financially. A hardware platform that they can update as needed, that will give users more control to generate content; free from the concerns of pushing an update through Apple or Microsoft. In turn, their goal will be to leverage content creation by connecting users in a unified economy, again, that they control. They engaged Yanis Varoufakis [3], who is a renowned academic economist, no doubt to assist in that endeavor.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzn6E2m3otg&t=783"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzn6E2m3otg&t=783</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steambox#Steam_Box"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steambox#Steam_Box</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/it-all-began-with-a-strange-email"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/it-all-began-with-a...</a>",1379377128

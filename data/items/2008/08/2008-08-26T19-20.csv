Cost: $200-300. You don't need a lawyer to do this in a one-person shop; just fill out the web form and give them your credit card number.<p>* You want a business lawyer once you have multiple employees (whereupon you'll restructure the company, often to a C corp so you can issue equity) or before you sign your first complicated contract.<p>* If you charge money, you probably have terms and conditions, and you probably want those reviewed before you publish them.<p>* You don't need to do anything special to claim copyright in the US, or anywhere else the Berne Convention applies.<p>* Nothing stops anyone from copying your idea and launching their own site except for a contract that they actually sign that prohibits them from doing so. When you launch, the clock starts ticking.<p>* Regarding your next question: welcome to the Internets.",1219780776

I did that for my first company and didn't hire a lawyer until 3 years later. I highly recommend doing this before you launch your startup.

You can say, truthfully, that there are certain words grownups are allowed to use that children aren't. You can say ""You are not allowed to say that because if you accidentally say it at a friend's house, his parents won't want you coming over to play anymore."" That's very likely true. You may be leaving some things out -- reasons that you don't fully understand and therefore don't know how to explain to a small child -- but you don't have to actually tell any lies.<p>You don't have to believe in religion to teach your children that you respect other peoples' beliefs, and don't try to correct their religious beliefs when you don't agree with them. Of course, if you actually think they're stupid for having those beliefs, then you will have to lie by omission to help their social life. I haven't told my children any more than they asked about my beliefs, so it took until my daughters were about 10 until they realized I don't believe in God at all, but I didn't lie or pretend to believe something I don't, either. They understood from an early age that different people believe different things for a lot of reasons and it's only polite to respect that.<p>If your kid is curious enough to ask questions that can't be answered without explaining the mechanics of sex, you can also teach him that we don't really talk openly about sex in polite conversation, and that other kids might have parents that don't want them to know about it yet. And remind them that it's important to them socially that they don't get in trouble with their friends' parents.<p>You can say that George Washington Carver's achievements were not so much scientific as social (and you don't entirely understand why they're learning about him science class), without saying that no black scientists are worthy.<p>This is the approach I've taken, and it's worked pretty well so far. We live in a very ""Christian"" suburb, and so far my kids haven't been kicked out of any homes for being inappropriate, nor have any of their parents come to me with concerns about such things.

They invest in wildly varying startups.  I was surprised when we were asked to come for an interview, and equally surprised when we were accepted...because YC had never funded anything in our area before (we're not web 2.0, we're not a hosted app, we're not social or user generated, and our design sense historically kinda sucks).  But, history now indicates that YC is looking for more than merely more web 2.0 apps.  They've now funded hardware, enterprise apps, sports related apps, and a lot more.  There is no ""YC style startup"".  Reddit was a great success, and one can find parallels in some of the other YC startups...but there are far more that don't fit that mold at all.<p>If you tweak to fit what you think is the YC mold, you may very well tweak out the really unique and interesting bit of your application.",1219780362

The reason: while the Manhattan project was running, DoE scientists were aware that radioactive weapons would cause amazing and lasting damage, but really didn't know much about how radioactivity would affect living things specifically. So a parallel project was set up to study the effects of radiation on cells -- e.g. selectively damaging DNA and proteins and watching what happens to the organism. Research continued after the Manhattan project ended, and eventually led to the Human Genome Project.<p>Another resource you should definitely be familiar with is NBCI:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</a><p>Yes, algorithms are an important area of research. Caveat: it's entirely driven by biology. For example, aligning two partially matching protein sequences requires a clever algorithm. Sounds like diff, right? The catch is, related sequences don't match particularly well until you take into account which transformations are more likely to occur in nature, which takes significant biochemistry to determine and use properly. So really, your best bet is to associate yourself with a university of some sort, since that's where most of the molecular biologists tend to hang out. Learn biology first, and you'll pick up algorithms in the process.",1219780343

I was closer to the girl, although I had absolutely no romantic interest in her. (I had a girlfriend at the time and was madly in love.) The couple broke up; the guy was angry at me and, drunk, he attempted to physically attack me. Bad end, because I liked both of them and wish we could've stayed in contact. I packed up and bolted pretty quickly, taking a 1:30 am cab ride to... the office.<p>For a month and a half, I was living at work. This was a regular office space-- not a home office. I had a sleeping bag rolled out on the floor and used the gym shower in the morning. This was an understaffed, workaholic company, and I had to spend 6-11pm in a coffee shop to get away from ""home"". When my then-girlfriend visited me in the city, I had to check into a hotel. Being a cheapskate, I lined up a one-star out in Queens.<p>After that, I found a decent roommate and moved in with him. The only quirk in the arrangement was that he and I had diametrically opposite approaches to the Quality/Quantity trade-off, so I met (or at least heard) a lot of strange people.<p>Fun all around.

Help them find roommates if you know people who are moving into NYC at the same time. Once they've found apartments, set them up with utilities.<p>Most companies that are successful at bringing people into New York do so through internship programs. New York is much less intimidating to a college student looking through internships, who doesn't have a problem with finding short-term sublets and roommates online, than to an adult seeking full-time work.",1219777727

As much as I think NYC realtors are a useless, overpaid class of people, it's difficult to attack the NY market without one, and they are egregiously expensive: 8.3-20% of first-year rent, usually 15.",1219777475

I did throw away my furniture in Cambridge, shipped my car ( about 1.2k) and moved in here.  That 5k helped in buying some new furniture, and downpayment for first/security for a rental, and of course the plane ticked and shipping of some boxes with my belongings.<p>My work, also provided me with a month and a half of free (temp) housing, until I found my own place (which was a real pain in SF).  They also provided me with a rental car, until my car was shipped from the east coast.<p>Without all this help, I would have thought twice about moving in the Bay area.  While 5k relocation assistance might be good enough for a young single person, it probably wont be for somebody with a family.<p>Great hackers don't have hard time finding jobs,  so if you  really want to attract the best, be willing to provide the above.<p>Also, I am not sure how is the situation in NYC, but I think some of the best programmers are in the SF Bay area, and few in Cambridge/Boston area.<p>But at the end of the day, if your idea is not apealing to people, it would be hard to attract them on money/perks basis.",1219777431

It can be productivity booster too, since your staff don't have to spend an ~hour walking, hunting for a good restaurant, waiting for food, eating said food, and walking back when the food is just right there.<p>This can be more of a personal preference type of thing.",1219777429

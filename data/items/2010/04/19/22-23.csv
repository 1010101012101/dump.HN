1278079,comment,1277700,1277700,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"Quick explanation of what exactly this is:<p>It's a rule change regarding asset-backed securities.  ABS are a type of bond where the interest and principal payments come from the cashflows of some pool of underlying assets.  The simplest example is the now-infamous mortgage-backed security: a bunch of mortgages are put into a pool, and each month the homeowner's payments are passed through to the mortgage-backed securities holder (with some amount taken off the top to cover the cost of collecting, processing, and insuring payments).<p>There are many generalizations of this concept.  There's no reason the underlying asset has to be mortgages.  It could be auto loans, credit card receivables, student loans, whatever.  And there's no reason that the cashflows have to be passed straight through to the bondholders.  This is where Python comes in.<p>There are a number of complicated rules you can define.  For example, let's suppose I have $100mm of assets.  Rather than just having $100mm in bonds on the other side, I can define two pieces, or tranches.  Tranche A is $80mm and gets paid first; the $20mm Tranche B gets paid next.  So if some assets don't perform and the $100mm face value only turns out to yield $90mm, the investors in A are completely unaffected.  This method is helpful because it can create a safe asset out of a pool of generally unsafe assets.<p>Another possible rule would be again to define two tranches, A and B.  Each month, A and B receive the full interest payments on the $100mm assets.  But A gets the first $50mm in principal, and B only starts getting paid principal when A is completely paid off.  That way, tranche A has a shorter average life than the underlying pool of assets, and tranche B has a longer average life.  This is helpful because some investors might want to buy short-term assets, but others might want to buy long-term assets.<p>You can define a hugely complex range of rules, depending on the purpose of the investment and the type of underlying asset.  From what I can tell (I obviously haven't read the whole document), the SEC is proposing to require ABS issuers to specify these rules in Python, and to specify the underlying asset pool in an XML format.  This will make it easier for independent investors to analyze the securities on their own, without having to let the now-discredited rating agencies do their work for them.<p>In general, sounds like a great rule to me.",1271717145

Eventually, he discovered that there was no guarantee that the list being searched was <i>sorted</i>!<p>As for writing out whole C programs and getting it right without debugging -- I once wrote a bit-banging controller for a model aircraft.  We did bit-banging with a Gumstix board, which would let us use GPIO to implement 9 PWM inputs and 9 or 10 PWM outputs in software.  I wrote a bit-banging loop that did all of the inputs and outputs and let programmers define control mixing functions and finite state machines.<p>I was unable to test it, because you can only test something like this by attaching to the hardware.  Well, <i>it worked the first time and it can run the remote control of a model aircraft in flight</i>.

Most people have no problem at all with a standard employee relationship given good conditions and circumstances, and it is nicer in general if you can stand it. There's much less to worry about, there's consistent flow of guaranteed pay, there's a lot of people to interact with and meet, etc. The majority of people are perfectly OK with this, even with the knowledge that corporate is making a lot more money off of their efforts than they are.<p>It is okay to be content with that if everything else is good. One of my old managers just wanted to be that, but was forced into a leadership role by happenstance, and it was horrible for him and everyone under him. He cared much more about remaining non-confrontational and diplomatic than he did about being effective. This is bad; it led me to quit.<p>Of course, not all 9-5 employees are like him, and some are great leaders. But they're content with the money and the situation so they stay with it.<p>Some people have a hard time tolerating that, which people often become entrepreneurs. These people are good and important too.<p>If no one was content with employment, we'd be full of one-man shops and our efficiency would be majorly decreased. Employees are important. Founders can't really get rich independently (i.e. without an acquisition) without employees; there's just no way they could do enough work on their own.<p>Most employees understand what's going on and they're fine with it.

For your web-based app for a financial enterprise, you’d only need knowledge/skills on database/SQL, HTML+CSS, and front/back-end programming (i.e., JavaScript, PHP, VB.NET). Here you’d only need reference materials, as you can easily find how to develop the modules you’d need.<p>However, imagine what you could miss? During the design phase, diagrams, (R)DBMS, OOP, algorithms and software engineering skills are some of the vital CS fundamentals that will eventualy result to the overall quality of your app. You may be able to develop a complete app, but you may not be able to know if it’s the best implementation. While testing your app, you might find some CS concepts (i.e., data structures, searching, Big Oh) relevant along the way, to enhance the processes maybe. Yes you could study these topics by your self, but you might be more effective if these are already in your armory before jumping to the job. Like when you’re programming, an OOP approach might be a better approach as early as the initial coding, rather than convert to it after launch. Or you might learn that you could offer real-time collaboration using other networking/Internet technologies.<p>Yes you don’t need a CS degree, but let me suggest that you scan the CS topics before you start designing your app. Someone who has a CS background may be able to forsee all posible problems and solutions to its system right after the inception of the idea, while someone who’s not, must explore all possibilities and validate them in each step he/she would take. I’m not saying that you cannot build a good app, I just hope that you won’t miss something. Good luck Sir!",1271715330

448765,comment,448711,448745,0,0,dmm,,,"You should read the whole paper, the abstract is not enough. Observational studies are extremely sensitive to the methods in which the data is collected.<p>For example I heard about a study linking meat consumption and heart disease. To determine if there was a link, the researchers interviewed people every few weeks asking them how much they ate of various foods. Do you remember how many kilograms of chicken you've eaten in the past few weeks? I sure don't. Also I suspect that there could be a bias in people reporting less meat, either out of shame or people overestimating portions. A portion of chicken is eight ounces, that is about the size of a deck of cards. These things made me suspicious of their findings.<p>Science is hard. Stay vigilant :)",1232862697

448750,comment,448293,448293,0,0,shrughes,,,"Another reason monads are cumbersome in other languages is that other languages use lazy evaluation.  If you consider the naively implemented function<p><pre><code>    skipMany :: Parser a -> Parser ()\n    skipMany p = (p >> skipMany p) <|> return ()    \n</code></pre>\nand then consider how you might write it in some other language, you'll note that the translation, strictly evaluated, gives infinite recursion.  To practically work with monadic computation requires some form of non-strict evaluation.  Another, less catastrophic example would be the following.<p><pre><code>    printNTimes :: Int -> String -> IO ()\n    printNTimes 0 s = return ()\n    printNTimes n s = putStrLn s >> printNTimes (n - 1) s\n</code></pre>\nStrictly evaluated, that would build up Theta(n) memory usage.<p>For this reason, the more computation-oriented monads cannot be used practically in other languages without added weight to avoid strict evaluation.<p>Ironically, it's the non-monadic uses that cause the problems -- those that don't need the full power of 'bind', i.e. uses where the monad's user doesn't pass return values from previous actions to future actions.  When you pass a return value, you end up needing a lambda expression, which cuts off strict evaluation.  When you only use them in ways that applicative functors can be used (which often applies for parsers), that's when you suffer.  It's not the end of the world; there certainly are workarounds, but that requires adding explicit promises everywhere, which is just a pain.",1232861516

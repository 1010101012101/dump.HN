We had an implementation that was &quot;good&quot; a few years ago, but was ultimately fundamentally inferior to the approach taken by C++ lambdas. The period since has been a fascinating exploration of ways to make closures safe, usable, and potentially zero-overhead in a language without garbage collection.

Grade inflation has been strongly encouraged by institutions&#x27; statistical collation, but has been mostly avoided by the SAT.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that I want students to have access to good grades even if they consistently give wrong final answers, transposing digits and so on. It shows a lack of precision and a lack of full understanding of the question (not able to do effective sanity checking). Precision is a skill that mathematics can help people to learn, in my opinion.<p>The SAT being multiple choice means you have a fair opportunity to correct this type of mistake - a typographical error typically won&#x27;t fit with any of the multiple choice answers and you&#x27;ll have the chance to correct it (costing you only the correction time - and teaching you that precision is of some importance). The wrong multiple choice answers tend to fit deliberately with common conceptual errors. This actually illustrates a useful element of the SAT exam design.",1417045938

It appears amino acids aren&#x27;t all that hard to make, so they may have both fallen from the sky and been created on Earth.<p>But... amino acids are not life. There is a further step that is required for the actual pan-spermia hypothesis: the synthesis of more complex molecules, like RNA and DNA. If you think P(RNA|amino acids) ~ 1 then pan-spermia becomes at best irrelevant: not impossible, but not very interesting.<p>If you think P(R/DNA|amino acids) ~ &epsilon; then pan-spermia becomes very important, because it is far more likely than not that life on Earth is due to RNA or DNA that descend from an original synthesis that happened elsewhere.<p>Evidence suggests RNA synthesis given amino acids is not very probable. I don&#x27;t believe it has ever been observed to happen spontaneously the way amino acids are spontaneously synthesized in the Urey experiment. So pan-spermia cannot be dismissed on the basis that it is uninteresting.<p>DNA propogating itself across the universe is also not very probable, so the two hypotheses remain in competition, and it isn&#x27;t obvious which is more plausible. Pan-spermia requires things like &quot;DNA can survive re-entry.&quot; So the OP is correct: discovering that DNA can survive re-entry makes &quot;Life originated elsewhere&quot; more plausible.<p>You&#x27;ll notice I never used the word &quot;simplicity&quot; in any of this. There is no simplicity: only probability and plausibility. Evidence is more or less probable. Propositions are more or less plausible.

My point is that nobody was even <i>thinking</i> of digital duplication as an issue that required discerning between people doing it for love and people doing it for money. We were <i>forced</i> to develop an opinion, <i>forced</i> to draw this particular line by established interests crying foul ever since the &#x27;70s (and probably even before).<p>We weren&#x27;t born with an innate sense that is wrong to pay for certain types of digital copies; our rational economic instinct is to try and get the best bang for our buck, not to investigate whether the seller is actually allowed to sell us that particular bang. That is why contraband is as old as the world.<p>It was a constant stream of threats and propaganda from established interests that taught us that there is a &quot;good copy&quot; and a &quot;bad copy&quot; and people selling &quot;bad copies&quot; are unworthy of getting our money. Now it&#x27;s natural to think that <i>there is a line to draw</i>, regardless of where you actually draw it. That line wasn&#x27;t there before &quot;they&quot; told us to look for it.<p>For taxis and hospitality, this process of education/indoctrination has not happened, because there was no real need -- these matters were settled in law decades ago through the (mostly democratic) process, and that was it. Established interests could draw the line at any time with a couple of phone calls, because you can&#x27;t hide a hotel or a cab for long; there was no need to involve the public, no need to divulge the finer points of hospitality law or to develop in their customers <i>a critical approach to doing business in these markets</i> like the entertainment industry was doing.<p>Now Uber and AirBnB are simply bypassing these established systems by using scale. They make infringers small enough and numerous enough to make enforcement unpractical on the ground, and use that as a lever to remove established systems of control. Incumbents are forced to ask the public to do the enforcement themselves, like the entertainment industry started doing so many years ago. So now more and more people know that there is a line to draw in those industries as well, but in numbers nowhere near what the entertainment industry amassed in almost 50 years of continuous advertisement of &quot;bad practices&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t have the exact same reasons of the entertainment industry: &quot;the law says X and these people are doing Y, please make them stop&quot;. (In fact, they probably have even <i>more</i> reasons, since regulation of these industries has some foundation in actual threats to the public -- hotels with no emergency exit, drunk unlicensed drivers etc. -- whereas nobody ever died because of an unlicensed tape.)",1417043740

They&#x27;re easily handled (no high pressures, low temperatures, corrosion, embrittlement, or other issues).  They&#x27;re generally really safe -- many liquid hydrocarbons won&#x27;t explode unless specifically induced to do so.  They&#x27;re a drop-in replacement for existing fossil fuels.  They could be blended with these, and can utilize the same processing, transport, and utilization infrastructure.  Engines would not have to be modified.  At the same time, for those who see efficiencies in electric drives, they&#x27;re amenable to hybrid-drive technologies.  And we&#x27;ve got well over a century of expertise in utilizing them.<p>For transportation, liquid hydrocarbons are very hard to beat, and for certain modes, all but essential, especially heavy land cargo, marine shipping, and air travel.<p>The research that the US Naval Research Lab is conducting is based on over 50 years of work on the concept, with the first studies undertaken by nuclear physicist Meyer Steinberg at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1964.  Steinberg continued his research through the 1990s, with further work at M.I.T. under  Michael J. Driscoll and more recently as USNRL (who peculiarly fail to cite the earlier research -- it&#x27;s rather like an evolutionary biologist failing to credit Darwin).  Steinberg&#x27;s work generally considered nuclear power as the electricity source, though any generating option could be substituted.  More recent research considers nuclear, solar, and OTEC, an ocean thermal power system.<p>The basic concept was suggested by M. King Hubbert, the petroleum geologist who predicted peak oil in the 1950s, in a 1962 report (though he suggested mining carbon from limestone).<p>In terms of process, there are two very-well understood processes operating at industrial scale presently, hydrogen electrolysis and Fischer Tropsch synthesis.  The third stage is where most research is focused:  on finding means to sequester carbon from seawater.  A small fraction is present as dissolved CO2, but most (about 96%) is in the form of dissolved carbonate and bicarbonate.<p>Since carbon is being drawn from the biosphere (seawater), it&#x27;s overall carbon neutral, though it might tend to bias balance slightly toward the atmosphere as compared to the oceans.  If run in excess of human energy needs (a very expensive proposition), it could sequester additional carbon from the atmosphere.<p>The primary energy cost is in the electrolysis, which returns hydrogen with about 60% of the energy capacity as the input electricity -- so your conversion costs you energy.  Fischer Tropsch processing is exothermic (more energy is released than consumed).  Energy usage of the CO2 separation phase is comparatively low, much of it is in the water handling -- you&#x27;ve got to move a <i>lot</i> of seawater to get the carbon necessary.  I suspect overall efficiency will be roughly 50%.<p>Though the Navy research is looking at this for their own purposes, it could just as well be used for civilian purposes.  The 100,000 gallon/day capacity seen for a carrier task force would be roughly appropriate for a city of 100,000.  My own cost estimates, including solar power provisioning, are higher than the Navy&#x27;s, about $9/gallon.  But that would be a stable price going forward -- with a renewable liquid fuels source, there are no oil embargoes, supply shocks, or imports.<p>At a national scale for the United States, supplying 20 million barrels/day, you&#x27;d require 2TW of power -- a solar collection region about 180 miles on a side.  That&#x27;s quite large, but as compared with biofuel-based alternatives, downright reasonable -- most plant-based fuel proposals if scaled out would require a sizeable fraction, or several multiples, of total US land area to provide an equivalent of present petroleum usage.<p>On the &quot;bad news&quot; front:  the fact that research has been conducted in this area for 50 years <i>without</i> significant implementation suggests that there may be engineering or other challenges which are frustrating broader application.  Or it could be that fossil fuel prices have simply been too low to allow larger-scale demonstrations.<p>I&#x27;ve explored a few other aspects of this in a series of reddit posts covering the USNRL&#x27;s work and other historical background.<p>Search on &quot;fischer tropsch&quot;: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/search?q=fischer+tropsch&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/search?q=fischer+tropsch...</a><p>USNRL research and papers:  <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/22k71x/us_navy_electricitytofuel_synthesis_papers_and/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/22k71x/us_navy_...</a><p>BNL/MIT history and papers:  <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/28nqoz/electrical_fuel_synthesis_from_seawater_older/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/28nqoz/electric...</a><p>M.

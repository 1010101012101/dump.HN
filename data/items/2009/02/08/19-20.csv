It is possible for systems of very small size to display temporary fluctuations where the entropy of a system and it's heat bath both <i>decrease</i>.<p>This is like your car inhaling CO2 from the exhaust, running backwards, and combining the CO2 to give oxygen and gasoline which is pumped into the fuel tank.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation_theorem</a><p>This process has real implications for how the cell works.

I think it's a shame, though, that the public was very gung-ho about doing away with the ""tax"" on telephones and computers, etc., but never considered the ramifications of reducing the ability of AT&T, IBM, etc., to do that basic research.<p>I also think it's worth noting that the longer the time-scale over which the research will become profitable, the greater the number unforeseen applications. A good example of this was Shannon's work at Bell Labs. Not only did it justify the eventual move toward digital transmission, but it also made possible a wide swath of genetics research. Now who could have foreseen that? and how much did those geneticists actually pay for the research?<p>As for the ability of researchers to game the system, and your assertion that the University entrepreneurship push is all for show, I'm less sure than you that ""everything will be okay"". I recently, as a graduate student, approached the office of sponsored research (OSR) for assistance in applying for NIH funding. The people in OSR didn't have a director and didn't know who was overseeing my department. When I finally did locate the correct person there, he was rather helpful, but I posed the question to him: There are many opportunities for both students and professors, but I had to find this one on my own. Why doesn't OSR promote more federal funding?<p>His response was that the school is actively pursuing funding through patent licensing and commercial partnerships, so the OSR has received less attention and has fewer resources at its disposal.<p>In other words, I don't doubt the ability of researchers to sell their basic science programs to federal funding agencies and the public as having practical applications, but I do worry about them loosing institutional support as institutions look more and more toward industry partnerships. After all, a congressperson might be fooled into believing that <i>E. coli</i> genetics research can help cure heart disease (a spin that I personally put on an application for AHA funding ;-), but Merck or Pfizer will be much less enthusiastic about the same spin if they don't have a lead molecule in 3-4 years time.",1234120126

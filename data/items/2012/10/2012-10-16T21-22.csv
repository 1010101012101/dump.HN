4662088,comment,4660842,4660842,4,0,thebigshane,,,"The ""spaced repetition"" theory is similar to something I read in Wired[0] long ago, of a guy and his note-taking ""SuperMemo""[1] app. The article drifts aimlessly about the guy, but the theory behind the app is very interesting.  And the chart is excellent[2].<p><pre><code>  For example, say you're studying Spanish. Your chance of
  recalling a given word when you need it declines over 
  time according to a predictable pattern. SuperMemo tracks 
  this so-called forgetting curve and reminds you to 
  rehearse your knowledge when your chance of recalling it 
  has dropped to, say, 90 percent. When you first learn a 
  new vocabulary word, your chance of recalling it will 
  drop quickly. But after SuperMemo reminds you of the 
  word, the rate of forgetting levels out. The program 
  tracks this new decline and waits longer to quiz you the 
  next time.

It seems even worse with this newest incarnation: Streets form the backbone through which everything runs.

4662083,comment,4659305,4659824,1,0,toyg,,,"""Moral decisions""? In modern British politics? Unless you're talking about Robin Cook or David Davies, it's really hard to find any ""moral"" motivation behind political moves, and this is no exception.<p>This was an easy and popular choice to take. McKinnon was not a threat, and the US ""World Police"" stance has weakened a lot since the GWB days. Even better, it's an election year in the US in which an incumbent President has to motivate a disillusioned left wing; he really doesn't need the backlash following a potentially unpopular extradition.<p>The point had already been made: subjects of the Empire (which Western Europeans people are, de facto, especially if living in Britain) who dare attacking US military infrastructure, even in jest, <i>will</i> be hunted, and their lives made miserable. Whether they're actually going to be sent to Gitmo is irrelevant in practice: McKinnon's life is forever compromised on many, many levels.<p>So, in practice, Obama(/H.Clinton) doesn't give a rat's ass about McKinnon, and the Coalition has enough problems as it is, there's a good chance to score some cheap political capital, so why pass on it? Add to that the recent announcement about opting out of some EU laws, and you can see that May is positioning herself as friendly towards the right wing, classically ""individualist"" Tory faction which is currently threatening to ""tea party"" Cameron, and all without spending any money (which, in government, is always the best sort of action). I don't think there's anything ""moral"" in that; it's just another day in UK politics.",1350424517
4662082,comment,4660501,4661300,1,0,joenathan,,,"Microsoft was busy with Windows Mobile 6.5(1) which after many years of revisions was complicated to use and in dire need of a complete reboot. Motorola was living high off the Razor (which I purchased at launch at $300) creating a million different versions of it until they watered down the brand name.<p>Apple even teamed up with Motorola to do an iPod phone(2), which I think stands as the poster boy of what was wrong with the industry at the time, the echo chamber I refer to, everyone was so caught up with refining the innovations of the past that they ended up blind sighted by the original iPhone and scrambling to catchup; Many say that Google was finally able to do that with the Jelly Bean release of Android, the much more polished look of the OS combined with Project Butter for an overall very refined experience. In Microsoft's case it's clear Windows Phone 7 wasn't what it need to be necessitating another reboot of the mobile OS, maybe the shared Windows kernel, Direct X, native SDK and product integration Microsoft is promising will be the push it needs.<p>The funny thing is I think Apple as of late is falling into the same trap the mobile phone industry found itself in before the original iPhone. Most everything out of Apple lately is iterative and not innovative; it's very difficult if not impossible to keep an innovative streak going and not get bogged down on endlessly refining the original innovative product.<p>From the wiki (1)

http://www.linkedin.com/in/calufa<p>About me<p>I currently serve as the charismatic CTO of Giga-Lab. In Giga-Lab we collect (web scrape) and transform several gigabytes of information every day using a high distributed application running in the cloud. In Giga-Lab I manage, design and develop most of the applications, while maintaining a smart, clean and intuitive development process. Giga-Lab is all about team synergy, best practices, complexity management, and clean interfaces.<p>Prior to Giga-Lab I built several web-based applications including audio editors, game engines, web scraping tools, touch screen applications, online video processing applications, image galleries, video portals, and tons of flash templates.<p>...<p>I like to build abstract tools or systems, from the ground up, with no stupid frameworks or other type of unnecessary complexity. I like to inject essence to software. I really like understanding and building the interactions within the objects. For me its important that code make sense in a logical and semantical form.<p>I may sound idealistic, but still I build systems that works, that makes sense, and that have value. I am very good at inverse engineering, brainstorming, abstracting functionality and value, understanding the pieces that builds a system - holism -, and coming up with cool ideas with technical fundament. I am also a big dreamer.<p>Thanks alot for your time,

The 80s and 90s saw many many baby boomers start to retire, especially in the manufacturing and industrial fields, while vocational and STEM education paths became less and less popular with the younger generations. This also coincided with free trade ""reform"" and the beginnings of the outsourcing wave, which was very tech/industrial heavy and thus lowered labor wages here for competitiveness (whether or not it was necessary). Wages also vary extremely drastically, even across proximate geographies. I.e., in LA starting software dev positions were at $45-50k a year while in SV they are $70-80k. Having lived in both areas, the difference in cost of living is NOT that big.<p>While engineering itself may not be subject to much regulation, the H1-B process is. It is the equivalent of extraordinary ability but with a lower barrier to entry based on market needs instead of publications. As such it is very carefully regulated. As for ""artificially"" increasing supply... that's a weird way to put it. America is built on the backs of immigrants and having maximum quotas for the immigration of the highest skilled ones does not seem like artificially increasing the supply. The reality is that 90%+ of the world would gladly take a salary 30-50% lower than an American just to live here and the H1-B hinders such under cutting.<p>As far as engineering falling badly behind other fields... I don't see it. The Bay Area is obviously not representative but I don't know of a single engineer (not software) who is unemployed or has trouble finding consulting gigs for ridiculous $100+ an hour rates.

Most other things can be copied quickly enough, but the landscape is evolving fast enough that innovators can constantly one-up the competition, reaping greatest rewards.<p>By contrast, in capital-intensive, slower industries, these ""guard rails"" make a lot of sense - if it takes me years to make a breakthrough on the drug, but means of copying it a re super straightforward because I am required to publish the recipe for all to see, it makes sense to restrict the use of the recipe.<p>I don't see anyone publishing Google search algorithms for all to see.

Second, schizophrenia is an <i>incredibly</i> complicated illness that can take manifest in a whole host of unsuspecting symptoms, and is not easily treatable. And third, diagnosing and treating a mental disorder in children is <i>really hard</i>.<p>The last two points, I think, are very relevant to this article. While I sympathize with you, understand that child development is a very, very complicated thing. You have naturally hyper children, naturally withdrawn children, etc, and physicians are very wary to label any child with an illness, especially schizophrenia. When we're adults and have leveled out, it's easier to discern what is ""normal"" from ""abnormal."" But children are constantly changing, being molded by their environment, and so it's much harder to outline a symptomatic threshold of what's considered normal. Additionally, children exhibit mental disorders in very different ways than adult do; there are different sets of symptoms to look out for. And these symptoms can be anything from ""pressured speech"" (talking too fast. some kids are just naturally fast talkers, right?) to auditory hallucinations (but the child could have a vivid imagination, right?).<p>The treatment for schizophrenia is an entirely different beast. The goal is usually to just suppress the symptoms and to restore the patient to a functional baseline. In many cases, the disease progresses and the prognosis worsens. In your case, your child had early-onset schizophrenia, which is associated with a worse prognosis than late-onset cases.<p>Although there are studies that show that early detection and treatment of schizophrenia can improve the course of the disease, chances are your kid would have still developed much of the same symptoms and issues that he has now. It really sucks, and I sympathize with you, but that's the nature of the disorder. It's terrible, difficult to manage effectively, and can ruin lives. I've seen it.",1350422509

What I meant is that the instrumentation record (thermometers and satelites) is quite short (geologically speaking) vs. the proxy record (ice cores, tree rings, etc).<p>And maybe I can make another clarification. I accept that there is a warming trend visible in the geological record. I don't think that trend is the source of the 'debate' with regarding to catastrophic global warming.<p>The debate arises when climate modelers predict a <i>catastrophic</i> rise in temperatures that is a distinctly different signal layered on top of the accepted climactic trend and which is triggered by human activities.  This comes not from direct increases in CO2 but via postulated positive feedbacks in the system triggered by increases in CO2 or other greenhouse gases.<p>A 17-year pause in the background climactic trend (i.e. what the planet would be doing without human activities) is not at all surprising nor does it conflict with long term climactic trends.<p>A 17-year pause in the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming predicted by the models is a completely different story. When that is coupled to the continuing increase in CO2 concentrations you now have a way to evaluate the magnitude of the <i>postulated</i> CO2 feedback. The pause, despite the increased C02 would seem to indicate that the models have overestimated the positive feedback.<p>Without the positive feedback the dire consequences predicted by the models is much less likely and so the massively expensive and disruptive policy choices are that much harder to justify -- especially in the short-term.<p>TL;DR  A 17 year pause in warming is a strong indication that anthropogenic climate models are woefully incomplete and shouldn't be the basis for massive policy disruptions in the energy sector.",1350422130

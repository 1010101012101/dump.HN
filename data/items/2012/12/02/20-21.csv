It's not unrealistic for some of the more oddball single utility ""companies"" to find themselves aquired and rolled up with other strategic acquisitions, and the lot of them presented as some sort of B2B enterprise package worth far more when summed up.<p>In other words, with VC backed companies, the thing these companies are making isn't really the product in many cases is it? It's the companies themselves. Just like a gear isn't really much, but add some springs, and a few other odds and ends and you have a watch that people will buy. But it takes a bigger picture visionary to figure out that the company that makes gears and the company that makes springs should be both acquired to make that watch company. Till then, they have to try and find their way by either spending their investment dollars till they can find that visionary, or find a market supplying micro-miniature gears to other watch making companies.<p>The founders and investors are rewarded for taking the high risk of finding out that there <i>is</i> a market for micro-miniature gears after the acquisition.

I can easily replace anything that is damaged, lost or stolen, so these occurrences don't have to be a huge source of stress.<p>I like the idea of being able to go through everything I have and organize, clean and maintain all of it, say, once a week. If that's too much of a burden, that's a sign that I have too many things. Thinking in these terms also makes it very easy to give away things to lighten this load.<p>This thinking is partly informed by my experience maintaining software. Running and writing software means constantly keeping it up to date. New standards and new versions of dependencies are constantly being published, and security flaws are constantly being found, as Moxie Marlinspike certainly knows. Code needs to be updated to keep up with these things in order to be considered well-maintained or secure. Minimizing that burden gives you a better chance of keeping the quality high.",1354480004

4862368,comment,4861022,4862101,5,0,marcamillion,,,"It's kinda hard to quantify exactly - but I look at many things differently. For instance, when I see a product (say in a store, or on TV or something) one of the first things I think about is margins. As in, I immediately start to try and figure out if the margins are fat or thin. Thin margins means that the manufacturer is selling it at barely above cost (which is bad, in my humble opinion - but it depends on your perspective and your goal for that product, because Amazon sells all its hardware on thin margins because that fits into a broader goal which is to sell digital products to you once you own their hardware).<p>I like to see high-quality products that can command a fat margin in the marketplace, because it usually means that the company will be profitable and can continue making high-quality products (all other things being equal - like they don't commit PR suicide or they don't fumble on the production, etc.).<p>So that's one subtle way, another way is by evaluating public figures.<p>One of the most eye-opening things I have experienced is seeing ""knowledgeable"" people talk absolute garbage and many people listening to them without questioning what they are saying.<p>One such example is when Jack Welch did his rant about the jobs numbers right before the elections. I am not even talking about from a political perspective, but here you have a ""world renowned"" ex-CEO of a large company (one of the largest on the planet) and he is talking shit. He knows that the numbers can't be fabricated easily because of the way the system is setup, he also knows that any candidate that fudges the numbers has more to lose than to gain. As in, if Obama did fudge the numbers and the word got out, that would be the end of him. Period. No questions asked. The risk is too large for the reward.<p>But there are many people that would see who he is, and what he did and assume that he is speaking gospel. But because they don't understand the way the system works, and the incentives at play (Welch is going to be hit with much higher taxes, so obviously he has a vested interest in attacking Obama) they are oblivious and they believe him. Obama ""must be"" fudging the numbers. It doesn't quite work like that.<p>Yes, gov'ts do hide things and there are stuff they do that they don't want to get out - but when you understand the incentives that reporters/journalists (and more recently bloggers and every day ppl with smartphones, etc.) have to break ""huge stories"" you appreciate that it is harder to keep ""huge"" things secret.<p>Plus, I see startup ideas and companies differently - again...one of the most drastic changes is that I look at margins more, because they kinda tell you what type of company you have to build. In a thin margin company, there is very little room for error....because the profit you earn on each transaction is so small, so it takes you longer to build up a buffer to help you weather storms. Whereas if you have fat margins, you are more likely to be able to weather winds that will kill thinner margin companies.<p>One glaring example is looking at the differences in margins of two large companies. Walmart & Apple.<p>Walmart - $445B in revenues in the last reported year, $15.7B in profits.\nApple - $156B in revenues, $41.7B in profits.<p>So Apple did 1/3rd the revenues, but 3X the profits.<p>I would much rather run Apple than Walmart. That's just a personal preference. Many people thrive in the low-margin business....Walmart & Amazon are.<p>That decision, dictates the culture of the company you create. With a fat-margin business, you can invest more liberally in innovation and pay a premium for talent - it's much harder to do that (at the same scale) as with a fat-margin business.<p>Hope that provides some clarity, let me know if you have any other questions.<p><i>Edit 1: As for resources, I would check the finance & economics section of Khan Academy for starters. Then from there just do some reading on the various topics you have learned and start to consume quality journalism like the Financial Times or the Economist. It is staggering the garbage printed/shown elsewhere. Also, try to turn off CNN if you can.</i>",1354479845

To answer your question though, it's just important to realize that much of these techniques won't work in the majority of email clients. iOS and some Android built-in email clients are the ones that this will be great for.

I can see the effects of that being that it becomes harder to identify who is earnest and who is not, especially with such impressive people throwing themselves into the pool.<p>Either way, I think it's nothing but a positive to see YC continuing to innovate and tweak.",1354479243

This applies to most specific skills - violin playing, chess, calculus, computer programming, golf, basketball, quarterbacking, painting, etc. Of course, the reason for this is the typical person in the population has not dedicated that much practice time to a given specific skill.  You may be a great natural athlete, but if you have not spent at least some time learning throwing mechanics, a mediocre athlete who has practiced will be able to throw a better spiral.<p>However, it does not follow that ""everyone can be a computer programmer for Google"" or ""everyone can be a professional quarterback.""  If you want to make it to a high-level in a high paying or high status field, you must compete against other people who are also practicing really hard and who also have great natural talent.<p>Personally, I have around natural athletic ability. I play flag football, and am likely in the top 95th percentile of QB ability.  When I throw the ball around with friends at a BBQ, I can hit people in stride with tight spirals.  But I could never, ever be a pro-QB, or even a QB in a competitive amateur league.  My body simply does not have the appropriate build, and I simply cannot build the muscle strength to make the passes needed to be a great QB.<p>On the flip side, I have always had an innate knack for cognitive problems, I was always that guy in math class who got A's despite barely doing homework and not studying for tests. Now another person could also get A's in that class with only mediocre natural talent by studying very hard.  They might think that, ""Hey, I've worked hard, I got A's, I can do anything, I can get a job at Google some day.""  But if they go into the most cognitively demanding career, they will find themselves competing against the most naturally talented people, who also now have a financial incentive to work extremely hard, and the less naturally talented people will simply not be able to compete.<p>I find it unfortunate and self-serving, that so there are so many commentators and intellectuals, who are above average cognitively and (likely) mediocre athletically, who assume that the other people's failings at cognitive skills are due to lack of practice or lack of sufficient schooling.  Meanwhile they assume their own lack of athletic ability is due to accidents of birth.<p>That said, it can be very difficult to determine if your having difficultly in a subject is really due to innate talent or due to lack of practice.  When I took an intro computer science course, I noticed the professor was a completely horrible teacher (and lectures are generally a horrible way to teach math, computer science or any technical subject).  The textbook sucked too.  The people who did well in that class already had been programming on their own during high school.  The people taking the class expecting it to be an actual introductory course, who expected that if you just followed the lectures and textbooks that you would know how to do the assignment, ended up doing very poorly.  Even if they worked very hard, their total hours dedicated to understanding computer science was far below that of fellow classmates.",1354478509

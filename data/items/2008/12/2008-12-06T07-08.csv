387966,comment,387921,387949,0,0,silencio,,,"I'm fluent in two languages and know a minimal conversational-level with three more (and enough that I ""think"" in those languages, as opposed to a ""lookup table"" of sorts). What happens is I usually think in English (most used, maybe first (still disputed by parents, heh), most knowledgeable in), but once in a while I'll think in whatever language has a word I know that seems to match whatever it is best. There's also those loan words in every language that for whatever reason might seem to fit. I unfortunately can't think of great examples right now, but one would be schadenfreude (although I don't know German at all, quite possibly my favorite word ever, although rarely actually used). It isn't necessarily because I don't know the appropriate vocabulary in the language, just that whatever word seemed to have the right definitions and connotations for me to want to use it. Perhaps those word-equivalents in a different language were extraordinarily obscure, and I don't know of it.<p>In addition to the above, which is typically my ""average"" thinking, if I'm talking to someone in a different language, I don't really ""think"" in English until I reach the point I made above, if I come across an English word that made more sense. I don't know if it takes <i>extra</i> effort, but the language used to think does seem to change.<p>Once in a while I'll think of images instead of words. One example are those..<i>cough</i>..shock sites out there.",1228550102

I can read and write French and German but I don't really think in these.<p>I find that  the ""voice in my head"" speaks different languages at different points in time.

The funny thing is when I'm around a localized Chinese dialect, say Taiwanese speakers, the voice in my head adopts that accent too. It's probably because I don't usually think in Chinese.",1228549923

387947,comment,387921,387921,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I too think is English. It's the only language I'm fluent in so that much is natural. One interesting thing I've noticed is that when I'm conceptualizing something, I will have an idea in my head, but out of some bizarre habit I will think the words through.<p>My point is that I already know what I'm going to say in my mind, but there is no reason to actually hear my brain think them. Basically I go through 3 steps in my thought process:<p>1. Think or conceptualize,<p>2. recite what I've thought to myself (in my mind, in English of course),<p>3. process what I've just heard myself think and act on it.<p>My question is this: why is step 2 necessary? It would be faster just going from conceptualization to processing, wouldn't it? Maybe it's a habit from reading at a young age when I sound the words out in my mind as I read.",1228548941

387944,comment,387921,387921,0,0,breily,,,"I'd noticed this sometimes too, but I think it's something that you can change if you want to. When I was learning german, after a couple years of high school classes I went to a month long full immersion program. When I finished that, I was thinking entirely in german. This stopped over time as I went back to English, but I can still make myself do it sometimes. So with practice/time, you could probably teach yourself to think in something besides English. Though English seems like it might be the most efficient mode for a native speaker.",1228548653

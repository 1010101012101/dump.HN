5119309,comment,5111073,5117209,1,0,brianchu,,,"Let me clarify. I did not say that deterrence is <i>utterly without use</i>. When I said that there is a problem with deterrence, I meant that the current state of deterrence in our justice system is broken. There is a mistaken belief that more punishment necessarily entails greater deterrence, which is many times not the case. There is really a threshold when it comes to deterrence. There is very little to no deterrent effect of the death penalty vs. life without parole, as others have posted here. In fact, I personally find it hard to believe that a life sentence versus, say, 50 years in prison, has any additional deterrent effect for something like murder. The rational 90% would still be adequately deterred.",1359176375

5119305,comment,5118739,5118998,13,0,BlackAura,,,"We won't know until we get there.<p>Generally, the performance of a video codec is held back by available hardware performance more than anything else.<p>The specifications of a video codec generally specify the decoder, but not the encoder. The decoder specification is intended to be implementable on hardware or software, so it can be played back in real-time, either now or in the immediate future. If some compression technique is available, but can't be done real-time, it can't be used. If a compression technique could be done real-time but only if limits are placed on it, then limits will be placed on it.<p>The encoder has to generate a bitstream that the decoder will decode, so it's limited by the decoder's capabilities. To an extent, it's limited by available algorithms (see how much better a modern h.264 encoder is compared to the original ones), and by encoding performance (particularly if you need to encode in real time, but even offline encoders can only be so slow before they become useless), and the quality / compression performance tends to get better with time. It's still limited mostly by the decoder, though.<p>This example is for audio codecs, but LAME actually generated higher-quality MP3s than all of the first generation of AAC encoders, entirely because it had smarter encoding algorithms. For that matter, XVID tended to produce videos that rivaled, and occasionally surpassed, the first generations of h.264 encoders. Despite that early lead, both LAME and XVID were overtaken once the AAC and h.264 encoders matured, because they were still limited by the decoders they were targetting.<p>There's probably still a long way to go just adding complexity to the decoder, even if we don't invent any new techniques. Eventually, it'll get to the point where you could increase the limits on the decoder, but you'll end up using far more power, and getting no noticeable improvement.<p>So, the limit would be the point when nobody can come up with any new techniques, encoders can perfectly measure perceptual quality (and therefore make perfect decisions about what techniques to use to get the best combination of bitrate vs quality), and improving existing techniques has a high cost and very low return.<p>I don't think we're anywhere near there, yet.<p>Lossless codecs, on the other hand, definitely do have a hard theoretical limit, because they can't discard data like lossy codecs can.",1359176288

Somebody went to a lot of work to make the site have all those bells and whistles, and they totally blew it. It's just ridiculous! I move the mouse over a picture and the picture flips around to show me some info about it. OK, but what happened to the picture? I wanted to see the picture. So I try to click, and that only works half the time. You have to catch it quick before it flips around to display the title card. Good luck with that. Then if the click registers, it does this weird two-way-but-not-both-at-once animation and finally shows me the picture. Then I can close that, lose my place, and pick some other picture to look at more or less randomly.<p>This is NOT the way to make a photo gallery.<p>By contrast, the ""blogspam"" page has all the pictures in a simple page that I can scroll up and down.

Indeed you can, and it even has a keyboard interface: the left and right arrows work just as expected.<p>But what's all this scrolling?

If you cheat your way through the medical exam, so what? You won't last ten minutes in your apprenticeship.<p>In fact, I've witnessed this, as has pretty much anybody here who has ever given an interview to a college grad with a very pretty GPA who flames out of the interview barely able to tie their shoes in code. Either they literally cheated their way through college, or more likely, just overfocused on the credential part of the process, but they don't make it into a position to do damage. (And if they did, well, whatever system accepted them probably isn't long for this world anyhow <i>or</i> has long since adapted to letting those people in and still somehow keeps them away from Big Red Buttons.)",1359172865

Those companies don't actually grow the crops themselves, but rather they buy them from the farmers (big and small). We (FarmLogs) have happy customers of all sizes from some of the biggest farms in the country to very tiny operations. Even though some of the big ag companies do have some limited software for farms, there is still plenty of room for innovation that only a startup can deliver.",1359172849

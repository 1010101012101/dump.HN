2789158,comment,2787933,2788329,2,0,qntm,,,"Alpha-beta pruning sounds like a reasonable route forward. In this case, each ""well"" is a state in the game and placing a new piece in the well constitutes a move to a new state. Since the ""heuristic value"" of a move is absolute (player wins or AI wins), I already have stuff in place to exit early from an exhaustive evaluation of all possible landing points if a definitive answer is found. But I don't have anything in place to put those landing points into an optimal order for evaluation purposes. A Tetris-playing AI which can quantify the ""goodness"" of a move would be useful here, and that's entirely possible.<p>Intelligent caching is possible but I think it would be difficult for me to implement and I'm not certain that it would yield much benefit.<p>Actually, the procedure for identifying all the possible player moves is very fast already and I think making it prioritise ""easier"" moves would slow it down.

2789124,comment,2788608,2788853,16,0,kenferry,,,"Yes  let's talk macros first.  Actually, first first you should look at multi-dimensional analog literals if you haven't seen it, <a href=""http://weegen.home.xs4all.nl/eelis/analogliterals.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weegen.home.xs4all.nl/eelis/analogliterals.xhtml</a>.  Awesome/yikes.<p>Okay, back.  What are the reasons to consider macros?  Probably, compile time checking and ability to directly use variables that are in scope (e.g., fooButton for some button).<p>The goal of compile time checking is really debugging, to make it easy to find and fix mistakes.  Now, in a format string, we don't have compile time checking, but we can have really good, descriptive error messages.  Our diagnostics were inspired by those in clang, <a href=""http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/amazing-feats-of-clang-error-recovery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/amazing-feats-of-clang-error-re...</a>, right down to the carat pointing at the problem within the code.  Maybe we could have done that with macros?  I guess I didn't really try that hard, but usually if you mess up a macro, you're going to get something really cryptic from the compiler.  Also, it's wayyyy easier for the client to grok and feel comfortable with a format string than with a crazy macro system.  You know how we're parsing the string.  You could implement it yourself if you had to.  It's understandable, and you can see that there won't be side effects.  Now consider that multi-dimensional analog literals link above.  Does it work?  Heck yeah!  Do you want black magic like that in your code, with behavior you don't understand (at least without way more investment in understanding than we want to require)?  Probably not!  Plus, we're likely to have to compromise on the visual design of the language now and/or in the future to contort it into what's technically possible in macros over ObjC.  This will also hurt debugging, in that you'll be less likely to quickly understand what your code says.  So for debugging, I don't think macros are actually going to be a win, despite the compile time checking.  And really, the above concerns are enough to kill macros for me.<p>Plus, we might be able to recover most of the compile time checking anyway.  I'd love to see clang's __attribute__ format extended to do checking of Cocoa visual format strings.  <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#index-Wformat-2426"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#i...</a>.  We have a bug tracking this.<p>Ability to directly use variables is a positive for macros.  As is, we have to pass a dictionary on the side that maps identifiers to actual view objects.  In python you could pass locals(), but ObjC doesn't maintain a symbol table at runtime.  For this we actually do pull a skankier-than-usual macro trick to make things easier.<p><pre><code>    id views = NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(fooButton, barButton);
</code></pre>
expands to something equivalent to<p><pre><code>    id views = _NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(@""fooButton, barButton"", fooButton, barButton, nil);
</code></pre>
and _NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings parses the comma separated string to make a dictionary mapping @""fooButton"" -> fooButton.<p><pre><code>    #define NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(...) _NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(@"""" # __VA_ARGS__, __VA_ARGS__, nil)
    APPKIT_EXTERN NSDictionary *_NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(NSString *commaSeparatedKeysString, id firstValue, ...); // not for direct use

</code></pre>
Okay, last, why not make this an actual part of Objective-C, like regexes are in some languages or like LINQ is in C#.<p>I feel like the reasoning here is more wishy-washy, so I don't know, maybe it's wrong and we'll revisit it.  Our system has a continuum from leaf code on which nothing else depends, like apps, down through AppKit, Foundation, and Objective-C.  The continuum isn't really defined by what framework some code is in, it's defined by how much sits on top of it in the dependency stack. As you go down toward the deeper and more built-upon parts of the system, reliability becomes more and more important, and our ability to cheaply change our minds if an interface isn't working out goes down.  The standards for simplicity and wide applicability go up and up.  Objective-C's deep.  You can literally learn _all_ of Obj-C in a weekend if you know C.  We like that.  In recent releases we have relayered things like memory management (GC, ARC) and properties from being framework conventions to being formal parts of the language.  But that's where the language is right now.  There's a pretty clear divide between language and framework, and the language doesn't reach up and violate the layering much. If we're thinking about moving something like these layout format strings into the language, we should also be thinking about printf-style format strings (or other templating), Core Data predicates, regular expressions and lots of other Cocoa-ness - basically obliterating the existence of any kind of layer boundary between ObjC and Cocoa.  These would be extremely controversial changes, inside and outside of Apple.  That doesn't necessarily make them wrong, but I'm not confident they're right.  Anyway, it's something that could be considered in the future.",1311248094

The ""Garnet"" user interface system, developed in the 90's by Brad Meyers at CMU, also has constraints for laying out user interfaces. I worked on both Garnet at CMU and OpenLaszlo at Laszlo Systems. Here's a description and comparison of the two systems, that I wrote a while ago:<p>Constraints and Prototypes in Garnet and Laszlo:

Programming without constraints is like writing in machine language: error prone, low level, tedious, inefficient and mind numbing.""<p>""Constraints are like structured programming for variables: In the same way that it's better to use loops and conditionals instead of gotos, it's also better to use declarative programming that says what you mean, instead of imperative peeks and pokes and side effects.""<p>A description of OpenLaszlo:<p>What is OpenLaszlo, and what's it good for?

And stuff not in the ""programming"" context disappears instead of cluttering my screen.<p>If I have to do this app-at-a-time, I need to bring to the foreground Terminal, MacVim, and Chrome, each with a separate hotkey press, then hide everything else.

The only point of contention I have is we couldn't realistically end a low-earth orbit program without something else in place.  The private sector had been interested in it for years, but never did anything about it, until recently.  I'm not sure why it finally happened. Computer technology? Advancements in aerospace engineering?  The web exploding and creating billionaires who now view space as their next personal challenge (see: Musk, Bezos)? A combination of all 3 is most likely.<p>Now that the private sector is taking over the mundane LEO missions (in comparison to what is possible), it's time for NASA to get back to doing what it was originally created for, adventure.",1311247003

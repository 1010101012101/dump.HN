But not in advertising copy. As to the latter, one cannot claim ignorance.<p>Try your position in a court of law after someone holds you responsible for an ""innocent misstatement of fact"" in advertising copy that leads to sales based on a false premise, and/or that causes injury.<p>Interestingly, about the difference between false statements and lying, this played a part in a scandal at West Point a few years ago, in which some students didn't realize the point you make about ordinary conversation -- lying must be intentional falsehood, with knowledge that the statement is false.<p>Nevertheless, someone who writes advertising copy can't claim this protection.<p>> Are people who write code with bugs just dirty liars ...<p>That's not the same at all. A programming bug isn't an intentional statement, whether true or false. A closer comparison would be someone speaking a word in a language he doesn't actually understand, and not realizing he's used the wrong word.",1354928270

Even Ultima Online (although hardly a typical heritage game) definitely shaped the way MMORPGs evolved.<p>Anyway, back onto Nomic. After reading the Wiki and seeing the ""Initial Rule Set"" [1] then reading through a lot of the archives it became clear that ""chaos"" and administration was the downfall of this game.<p>Eventually, the constitution that formed became so unmanageable and untrackable that it was impossible to progress. Judges were needed to resolve the rule disputes on every single vote and rule loop-holes were hard to spot (albeit an intended point of the game).[2]<p>But guess what we have now... Freaking version control. Companies/governments are tracking their constitution on GitHub at the moment, so why can't we also track the constitution of games such as this on GitHub as well. Last month GitHub launched their ""create a game"" contest that incorporated some form of ""Pull""/""Push"" feature into the game.<p>Well how incredibly awesome (I'm getting giddigy as I type this), would it be if we implemented Nomic voting rules using pull requests (for the votes), and have contributors sign up if they want to play the game.<p>Tracking the constitution changes was clearly the biggest technical challenge back in 1990s, and now we have tools to solve this problem totally.<p>GitHub makes Nomic awesome.<p>Ps. Ultima Online just made me feel all nostalgic.

My first thought goes to derivatives. directProduct is the right name. dProduct, dProd (if you like the Numerical Recipes style, expounded below) are better than dP, but still wrong for a library.<p>So first, let's assume directProduct is a library somewhere; maybe one you've even created. So let's reconstruct:<p>val z = directProduct(cg1, cg2)<p>Better, and more believable. And if the declarations of cg1 and cg2 are obvious (ie, the lines directly preceding) then you might have a case. I imagine directProduct(group1, group2) would actually be a happy medium. And if you use z in the next line or two, I'd let that slide.<p>The thing about Numerical Recipes is that often you're taking math syntax and coding it. Often doing so requires a good deal of commenting and temporary variables. One thing the book gets very wrong is it's function declarations (the function body is a separate argument) -- at the very least, rooted in a past of 80-character-lines and before code reviews. The first example in the book:<p>void flmoon(int n, int nph, long* jd, float* frac)<p>ought, in a modern era, be something like:<p>void MoonPhaseToDay(int n_cycles, int phase, long* julian_day, float* fractional_day);<p>If for no other reason than I can have some hope at understanding the second argument, or finding it again.

It's much easier to write 'f' than 'force'. on a blackboard. Moreover, when writing on paper, with ink that you have to make or buy, with a pen that wears out as you write with it, it makes sense that early mathematicians would embrace a compressed notation. Scribes even did it, so it shouldn't surprise us that mathematicians would.<p>The compression is based on domain knowledge, and this is only problematic for people who are not intimately familiar with the domain at hand. Physics is similar. Decoding the rocket equation is only possible when you know what m1 and m0 are, or ve, and many properties, constants, and even operations are symbolized with a single greek letter.  (Gradients, for example)<p>This is very powerful, because (as others have mentioned) it allows you to easily write more-complex things, and often times you (as a mathematician or physicist) prefer to think at a higher level of abstraction. It also makes it tremendously arcane for those of us who don't even know the names of the greek letters, let alone have a sound backing in that particular field of math or physics.",1354927068

And the measure you dismiss as ""blunt"" -- longevity -- has its good points as a rule of thumb measure. Stuff that kills usually isn't exactly good for your quality of life prior to killing you.<p>The drug in question is designed to help a tiny portion of the CF population which is an ""orphan disease"" to begin with. It is deadly and involves a lot of suffering, so it is a ""dread disease"". I think using a new drug that has the potential to help a mere 1500 Americans as your example because of the strong emotions associated with ""saving"" someone from something so awful amounts to a bullshit example.<p>Also, I worked for an American insurance company for five years. My diagnosis automatically disqualified me from some of their policies. So I suspect the reason American companies claim to cover this drug is because American rules are designed such that people with CF have trouble getting coverage at all. I was an industry insider for five years. I know how they make their money. Spending jillions on a small number of very needy people is not how they line their shareholder's pockets.<p>Most likely, they won't pay for it in England in part because that would involve actually paying that ridiculously high annual bill because I believe they have some form of national coverage. The American companies may list it as a covered medication, then do everything in their power to not cover any of the mere 1500 Americans with the alleles it is supposed to help. Plus the initial reports were spindoctored to boost company stock. There is a certain amount of hype surrounding this drug.

Part of this is because it involves abstract, complicated stuff that often must be understood <i>exactly</i>. But part is because we are not very good at writing it. Or perhaps we don't put as much effort into making it readable as we should.<p>Being someone who knows a fair amount about programming (or so I like to think) and also writes math research papers, I've found that some of the concepts used to manage complexity in software are also applicable to math.<p>In particular, I must agree about scope. I've made an effort in my recent writing to be careful about this issue. Another helpful idea involves how to write good comments in code. Too many mathematical proofs perform some operation without telling the reader why or giving any kind of overview. There is nothing wrong with saying, ""Here's what we're going to do,"" and then doing it, and then saying, ""Here's what we just did.""",1354926297

I am guilty of being monolingual, but if the most popular online source code management community used a language X that I did not know how to speak (especially if X was considered the lingua franca of software development), it would be a huge barrier of entry to me. While I would do well to learn X, an english localization of that platform would greatly ease my transition and encourage me to communicate with the predominantly-X speaking community. I would like to get the opinions on localization of github from people who are currently unable to communicate in English with a high enough proficiency to read these comments and voice their position here.",1354924923

When installing an OS I don't want many questions. I just want to get on with it. Ask me a question and you won't get my full attention and given the option to disable something I might just disable it.<p>Maybe a compromise is a notice while installing that the default is to search with Amazon and instructions on how to disable it. Those who really mind it can find their way there after the OS is installed.",1354924870

There were those old Safari search plugins that injected Amazon affiliate links into the results, or otherwise replaced existing ones with their own. That caused outrage.<p>The other thing is, I don't want my experience on Amazon to be modified by the things I type into my OS's search box, which I would expect to be private. What if, in a fit of loneliness, I search for my porn directory, then get a bunch of related items appearing on my Amazon front page?",1354924829

Until I was able to realize how the notation tied to finite numerical approximations, I never really understood it.<p>If you don't know what I'm talking about, the right way to approximate (d^2/dx^2)(f(x)) is to write an operator d defined as d(f)(x) = f(x + dx) - f(x).  And now your numerical approximation for the second derivative is (d(d(f))/(dx * dx))(x).<p>Now replace your d operator with the much better d(f)(x) = f(x + dx/2) - f(x - dx/2), and see how good your numerical approximations become!<p>The notation actually means something.  When we switched from infinitesmals to limits, we lost sight of that.  When you try to write the algorithm, you're going to be reminded of its meaning, fast.",1354924806

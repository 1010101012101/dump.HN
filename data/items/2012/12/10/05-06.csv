4897760,comment,4897625,4897732,1,0,JacobAldridge,,,"Thanks John. To elaborate (as far as we know at this point):<p>> Think a travel article that discusses how to spend a weekend visiting the Christmas Markets in Vienna<p>> We would have that as the sole newsletter content - ie, not one of a dozen stories in the newsletter<p>> It would also fit within a larger narrative - the previous day would end with a flight from Rome to Vienna; the next day starts with a flight from Vienna to Oman<p>> Where possible, we would tell the story of a local giving us the experience<p>> Links from the newsletter would come back to our website, but also onwards to more information about the destination or itinerary specifics (some affiliate links).<p>> Definitely not a daily deals type newsletter - there's a market for that, but we are content people<p>So user acquisition and monetization are the keys, as you point out. We have some early thoughts (social media, especially building reputations in travel forums, and SEO for the former; advertising, affiliate or most likely direct, for the latter). But launch early and learn has taken the place of ""first research for months"".",1355119195

You do not need to manually convert the PDF file to HTML; Saaspose.Pdf is there to perform the required tasks in your applications. The conversion of PDF file to HTML generates a unique and permanent link. This link would always be located at the same URL. One of the benefits of this conversion is that you can utilize the code generated by the conversion and place it as per your requirements. As it is a REST API, you only need to consume its REST interface in your application. You can either invoke these REST operations directly using your own code or you can use a REST client for your particular language.

If you search for Mildura at OpenStreetMap (openstreetmap.org) you'll get the correct location of the town, but if you scroll down the GeoNames list you'll also be offered ""Mildura Shire"" as a search option.  Click on that, and the pointer moves to a location similar to the Apple Maps screenshot, about 70km away from the actual town.  It seems that's the location that Apple's search has chosen to prioritize, over the actual town.<p>Mildura Shire is listed in GeoNames as a ""second-order administrative division"", so it's probably similar to the middle of a county or council area.<p>This isn't a problem with datasets or incorrect data, it's a problem with how Apple is searching & prioritizing the correct data they already have.  Choosing the ""town"" instead of the ""second-order administrative division"" would be appropriate here.<p>For what it's worth, GeoNames already prioritizes the town of Mildura correctly in their search engine.",1355118458

4897690,comment,4896894,4896894,31,0,grellas,,,"The issue is more nuanced than depicted by the title of this piece: the courts already reject patents based on abstract ideas and the real issue is how they should go about determining whether something is patent-eligible (and, hence, potentially patentable) or a mere abstract idea (and, hence, ineligible). The issue is one of trying to get the Federal Circuit to follow where these large software companies believe the recent Supreme Court precedent is trending.<p>A while back, I posted my analysis on why the <i>CLS</i> case is important (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633950"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633950</a>), which I repeat here for convenience:<p>""1. The <i>CLS Bank v. Alice</i> case, though raising an issue of vital importance, is not about 'whether software is patentable.'<p>2. Over the years, the Federal Circuit has notoriously broadened the scope of patent eligibility, most conspicuously in its 1998 <i>State Street</i> decision which essentially opened the floodgates to the modern rush of business method patents by holding that virtually any business method was patentable so long as 'it produces a useful, concrete and tangible result.' In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the <i>Bilski</i> case, repudiated the <i>State Street</i> test for patent eligibility and, though upholding software and business method patents generally, directed courts to be much more vigilant to ensure that no one gain patent rights to what are mere 'abstract ideas,' however much they may incidentally be tied to some computer mechanism in their implementation. In a follow-on decision (<i>Prometheus</i>), the U.S. Supreme Court similarly cut back sharply on the permissible scope of patent eligibility for claimed inventions that constituted nothing more than laws of nature.<p>3. In this <i>CLS Bank</i> case, the claimed patent involves a method for eliminating certain types of risk associated with an escrow closing and used a technological process by which to mimic a phantom version of the closing as a security check before allowing the real transaction to close. In essence, the technological aspect of this 'invention' is routine and so the question is whether anything beyond that is simply another way of trying to patent nothing more than an abstract idea. If so, it should fail under <i>Bilski</i>; if not, it would potentially pass the test for patent eligibility.<p>4. The lower court in <i>CLS Bank</i> held as a matter of law that the 'invention' was nothing more than an abstract idea and held it invalid as being ineligible for patent protection. On appeal, a divided panel of the Federal Circuit reversed and reinstated the patent. It did so, however, by setting out a brand new procedural rule whose effect would be to gut much of <i>Bilski</i> and reopen the floodgates to huge numbers of business method patents under a very loose standard - to wit, by holding, that, if it 'is not manifestly evident [my emphasis] that a claim is directed to a patent ineligible abstract idea,' then the court essentially treat the claim as eligible. What the Federal Circuit panel did, then, was to take the Supreme Court's directive for lower courts to be much stricter in evaluating dubious business method patents for patent eligibility and recast that directive in a form that said, if you as a court see that something is obviously nothing more than an abstract idea, then go ahead and reject it but you are otherwise to treat as being eligible for patent protection. In other words, the new strictness found in <i>Bilski</i> for evaluating such claims was once again to be transformed by the Federal Circuit into a loose standard that would let such claims coast by unimpeded.<p>5. Of course, this has set off alarm bells because, in effect, it represents yet one more revolt by the Federal Circuit against attempts by the Supreme Court to rein it in by bringing patent issues back to some semi-sane state. Following the panel decision (which was rendered over a sharp and stinging dissent), the losing party petitioned for a rehearing <i>en banc</i> (meaning by the full panoply of Federal Circuit judges as opposed to merely a 3-judge panel) and this was granted. Thus, we shall see whether the Federal Circuit is prepared once again to stick its thumb in the eye of the Supreme Court or whether it will temper its extreme pro-patent proclivities and follow the law as it has been directed.<p>So, this is a very important case affecting the trend of patent enforcement in a profound way but does nothing to challenge the idea of software or business methods being patentable in a general sense. For anything to change in that regard, Congress must act."" [end of repost comments]<p>In filing this <i>amicus</i> brief, Google, et al. are waving the <i>Prometheus</i> decision up and down before the full <i>en banc</i> Federal Circuit and imploring it not to repeat the mistakes of the past. If they are successful, all U.S. courts will be in a much stronger position to strike down these sorts of ""abstract idea"" patents as invalid. The question, then, is a procedural one of how courts should go about making this determination but the results could go a long way toward tightening up standards if this is rightly decided. We shall see.",1355117408

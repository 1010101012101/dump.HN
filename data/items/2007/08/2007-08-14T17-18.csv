BTW You think groupomatic will be a better meetup.com? Or are you trying for something different?",1187113834

42294,comment,42276,42289,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Thanks.  You mean colors, icons, and buttons aren't enough to be called Web 2.0?  Just kidding--I hear you.  I am looking for ways to make it more fun (a proxy for Web 2.0?) while keeping it simple.<p>Yes, I figured I'd hold off on search by term until there were a bit more groups, but it is definitely on the list.<p>I've been messing around with the Google Maps API, an am in fact using it presently to geocode cities outside the US.  I like the pin idea.  That would give it a more fun feel certainly.<p>I'm conflicted about the opening public group pages in a new window.  Originally, I had it like that but I wonder if it confuses people who are used to using the back button.  Jury is still out.<p>I certainly should have a learn more cool with screen shots, huh :)<p>Thanks for the suggestions!",1187113470

42292,comment,42068,42194,0,0,zach,,,"I agree that John Gabriel's theory is in play.  But I'm not suggesting that the people themselves are less mature, just that the net result is that SL is quite apparently more adolescent than FB.<p>And I think it's a great comparison.  Both of these social/entertainment systems were designed to be the way they are.  What are the results?<p>Certainly many people who have tried both and opted to spend many more hours on one than the other.  What difference is there in the communities on each, the interests represented on each, and the individuals who use each?  Which is better social therapy for the painfully shy?  Why hasn't SL had the FB-like mainstream breakthrough they've been expecting?",1187113036

42289,comment,42276,42276,0,0,tyohn,,,"I like it.  It's fairly clean and simple.  Did you consider making it more Web 2.0ish?  I am guessing that you'll add more search features ~ like search via activity or suchlike?  When you click on location maybe open a new window so I don't have to use my back button.  I think it would be cool to use Google's Maps API and have a ""pin"" where the groups are located.  And one more thing ~ maybe a link to ""learn more"" and then give details about Group-O-Matic.",1187112747

42286,comment,42262,42262,0,0,aston,,,"As the blog post was made by the guy over the FB platform, I can only assume this was a PR move. They wanted to kill an internal service to demonstrate that they're committed to making the platform work for outsiders. ""Courses"" hasn't been touched in ages (was it even officially an app??) and isn't at all core to the workings of the site (most people stop updating theirs, eventually), so why not?<p>Wake me up when they drop ""Photos.""",1187112584

The advantage a start-up has over a large company is their ability to have more intimate time with their customers.  Once a company grows over 25 people, meeting with each other inside the company to discuss the customer seems to become more important then meeting directly with their customers.",1187111846

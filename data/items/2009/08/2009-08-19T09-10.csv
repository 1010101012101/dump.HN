772412,comment,772174,772212,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Seriously?  What kind of technology is behind this thing that a 3am PST HackerNewsing could bring it down?  Even with the lowest spec cloud slice, no decently built web app should fold under a few thousand visitors.<p>My guess (from having various sites linked at the top of HN) is that you are seeing maybe 20 simultaneous visits right now.  If it's having scaling problems with this light a load, that's a serious problem.",1250675279

772408,comment,771013,771013,0,0,Nervetattoo,,,"Great article/mini book.
The only thing I miss is a more hands on problem solving example, its such a fun way to start learning something compared to just reading technical detail. Would certainly widen the crowd if you provided both :)",1250675055
772407,comment,771611,771895,0,0,bradgessler,,,"Can you post a link to some research that conclusively proves string theory being completely, totally wrong? If not, then let string theory stand as a hypothesis, but don't totally dismiss it (or dismiss it, you may or may not be wrong).<p>Also, if you think somebody is going to take a 10 minute web video as the answer to the universe (everybody knows it 42) and a substitute for an ungodly amount of science, research, and knowledge then you have mistaken.",1250675000
772406,comment,771179,771470,0,0,gdp,,,"From Withrow (1990), on ADA:<p><pre><code>  Module LoC  |  Error Rate per 1k LoC
  63          |  1.5
  100         |  1.4
  158         |  0.9
  251         |  0.5
  398         |  1.1
  630         |  1.9
  1000        |  1.3
  >1000       |  1.4
</code></pre>
This appears to show no such linear relationship between error rate and LoC within a single language, with a fixed amount of program text.<p>This report appears to suggest an observed average error rate of 18 defects per 1000 lines of code:<p><a href=""http://www.lanl.gov/projects/CartaBlanca/webdocs/PhippsPaperOnJavaEfficiency.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lanl.gov/projects/CartaBlanca/webdocs/PhippsPaper...</a><p>and the same programmer generated an average of 6 defects per 1000 lines of code in Java.<p>This is just a random sampling of error rates I could find quickly with a google search and a paper I already had on my desk, however the fact that three samples from three projects (two of which were from the same programmer) suggests that there is likely to be variation both in terms of the (fixed) amount of program text, and the problem between languages.",1250674995

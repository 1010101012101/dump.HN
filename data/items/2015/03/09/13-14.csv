To me devops isn&#x27;t about taking a developer who likes ops to save some money. Its about taking ops out of their walled garden and into the development process. As someone in ops, I&#x27;d much rather be part of the development process as I&#x27;m the one supporting the code in production.<p>If its a choice of message queues.. I&#x27;d rather have a vote to the one I know about supporting.<p>It isn&#x27;t really about cost savings as some companies I&#x27;ve been in I&#x27;m one of the highest paid engineers on the team. Its more about bringing ops into the process.",1425909579

9170919,comment,9170615,9170615,0,0,passive,,,"It&#x27;s fascinating how much this engineers experience shares with mine. We both appear to have similar approaches to working with technical systems, that has led to skillsets that are more broad than deep. We&#x27;ve both had interview problems because of this, and we&#x27;ve both ended up in DevOps.<p>I&#x27;ve also had more or less the exact same experience with DevOps, though with (hopefully) a happier ending. I was on a team working for a client that desperately needed &quot;DevOps-type&quot; things. So I built them, and their infrastructure team ignored them.<p>Eventually we stopped working with that client, and I was moved to a different organization, where each development team was doing it&#x27;s own thing, operations-wise, and had no interest in adopting a uniform approach, so my (short) efforts there were also for naught.<p>But then I had the opportunity to come back to the first client, as their DevOps Manager. Before I took the job, I talked to their current development organization about what their pain points were, and what actions they would be willing to take to alleviate them, and I built a strategy around that. A key part of this strategy was gradually eliminating the need for a DevOps team, as I firmly believe the best application of &quot;DevOps&quot; is as a joint project between Development and Operations to optimize shared processes. Once the friction is minimal, you don&#x27;t need a team there anymore. So we have a developer embedded in our meetings, and have more or less full control of any infrastructure.",1425909550

You&#x27;re probably in tech, and you probably make over 100k a year, or are pretty close.  To you, a few extra dollars doesn&#x27;t matter, so you want better quality.  Since you&#x27;re probably salaried, a few extra minutes doesn&#x27;t matter either.  Every time I go to a Chipotle on lunch, its easily 80-90 office workers.<p>I think the problem is the economy is splitting really aggressively.  The middle ground doesn&#x27;t exist any more.  Either you&#x27;re relatively well off, or you&#x27;re sharing shitty hours with a group of other minimum wage workers, and the idea of spending a few more dollars for lunch isn&#x27;t an easy option.<p>So to me the problem is, the only way to grow is to target the more wealthy individuals.  Except they never have, so they don&#x27;t have the mindset to do it, and their established brand is also working against them.",1425909539

I&#x27;d held off on buying a smart watch due to the common complaints people seemed to have:  battery life, usefulness, etc.<p>But honestly I saw it on sale for $175 and kind of wanted a new gadget so I pulled the trigger.  Since then it&#x27;s funny because the issues most people have (apps and such) have been the least important things about it for me.<p>I don&#x27;t mind laying it on the cradle when I go to bed every night and the same complaint some people have (it doesn&#x27;t do much that I can&#x27;t just do on my phone) means that I won&#x27;t miss it terribly if I forget the charger on a trip out of town and the battery dies after a day or so.<p>Really what I like about it is that it&#x27;s a watch...that I can change the face on.  The hardware looks nice and I can pick faces that show all sorts of info at a glance.  I&#x27;ve even spent a little time with apps like Facer and Watchmaker and some Photoshop/Illustrator to make my own faces.  It really is neat.  I can have my watch show an animated X-Wing flying down an 8-bit trench with a digital countdown-style time readout on top or I can make it look like a minimalist analog watch with a little weather icon made to look like part of the display.  I can show weather/radar or a visualization of the temperature over the next 24 hours as a ring around the face.  There&#x27;s really no end since you can just program it to look like whatever you want.<p>And yeah, I get little notices about traffic or Amazon deliveries and other typical Google Now stuff but that&#x27;s just icing.  I hate to say it but even as a function-over-form kind of guy, I&#x27;m actually pretty cool with something where one of the main functions is being able to play around with the form.",1425909227

What we&#x27;re able to do from a sensor and processing perspective today, I&#x27;m sure, blows away whatever the original Aibo did. I can imagine a return to this at a much cheaper cost.  The robot pet market never really took off, which makes no sense to me. Personally, I would love an intelligent robot dog that my real dog could play with when I&#x27;m not at home. Especially if it had basic teleconferencing features that let check up on my dog and my house. With VR, it might be possible to control the robot dog and play with your dog, as a dog.<p>The $59 robots at the toy store really aren&#x27;t the same thing. You need more than a trivial amount of intelligence and movement.<p>We need a robot pet startup here. Hardware is tough but if this thing sold under $500 and was at least as intelligent as the Aibo, I could see it selling in large numbers.<p>I also find it pleasing that Japan&#x27;s religious structures are so flexible that a robot funeral isn&#x27;t a big deal.

9170877,comment,9163044,9163689,0,0,benbjohnson,,,"Bolt author here. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d agree that Bolt isn&#x27;t good for time series. In fact, it has fast appends and fast sequential reads so it works really well for time sorted data. Having a sequential page ordering (like Catena) will have a huge boost when running on spinning disk but it&#x27;s much less of an issue on SSDs.<p>All that being said, I do like the approach of Catena. I think it works well for best case scenarios and you can get some large perf gains from tailoring the format to a specific type of data. However, some of the trade offs such as dropping writes after the in-memory window are not going to be acceptable to many people.<p>As far as disk usage goes, it sounds like you could improve the utilization by increasing Bucket.FillPercent to 1.0. By default Bolt splits pages in half since it assumes random writes. You can do some optimizations if you&#x27;re writing in order.<p>Another option that&#x27;d be interesting to look at would be doing Catena on top of Bolt. You can write your large, compressed Catena-ized data as a single value in Bolt and it&#x27;ll be laid out sequentially on disk. I know you mentioned that you don&#x27;t need transactions but I find them to be really useful once you start distributing data across a cluster and need some guarantees about writes.",1425909194

9170845,comment,9168035,9168035,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"I think the author is pointing to a problem but not correctly identifying what the problem is. The problem is deeper.<p>If the problem were that we have socialized risk of innovation but privatized the rewards, that wouldn&#x27;t really be a problem. It&#x27;s a good thing to incentivize innovation.<p>The real problem is that we <i>don&#x27;t</i> incentivize innovation.<p>Instead, we incentivize investment. People who already have money to invest take on small calculated percentages of risk to make back large amounts of money. Frequently the money investors are investing isn&#x27;t even their own, and they are paid a significant salary to do so, meaning they actually take on <i>none</i> of the risk.<p>The negative results of this are twofold:<p>1. Often investors don&#x27;t invest in innovation. It&#x27;s equally profitable to invest in number-twiddling schemes that provide no benefit to anyone except the investor, and often that&#x27;s easier.<p>2. We speak of companies as if they are single entities. But the reality is that executives and shareholders and of a company are the beneficiaries of any innovation within a company, while innovation typically comes from workers with technical expertise who are typically paid a relatively limited salary perhaps with some minimal stock options.<p>The way around this problem is typically to get into a company early enough that the line between technical worker and executive is blurred. But that avoids only the problems with lack of reward--it actually exacerbates the risk problem because early commitment to a company is a high-risk endeavor.<p>In the end, I think that a lot of innovators don&#x27;t innovate for money anyway--I personally would rather see something I make change the world than make a lot of money off an idea that doesn&#x27;t make any difference (or makes things worse!). As long as I have enough to live I&#x27;m okay. But it would be nice if we stopped pretending that our distribution of wealth is at all meritocratic.",1425908922
9170844,comment,9170100,9170100,0,0,RogerL,,,"Author here.<p>I struggle a lot with the choice of medium. In many senses Jupyter (IPython Notebook) is fanstastic in terms of workflow. With latex+external program+external data+external output it is hard to keep everything in sync. Here, it all happens in one place. And, of course, it should make it easier for the reader. &quot;What happens if I change this constant?&quot; (A normal question with scientific processing). Trivial to find out in the notebook; much more painful with a paper book.<p>OTOH, latex is mature technology, and I mean that in in the most positive way possible. I don&#x27;t have to worry that version 1.7 is coming out tomorrow, and that \int will no longer display an integral sign. I would like to make the book much more interactive - go all &#x27;Bret Victor&#x27; on it, but at what cost? I just tried to use Plotly, for example, but they don&#x27;t support the current version of matplotlib; they are skipping a version for whatever reason. I can&#x27;t expect readers to play the version war just to read a book.  Even with core Python+scipy stack I have doomed myself to endless maintenance as new, breaking changes occur. That is not hypothetical; IPython changed the format of the notebooks, and there went a weekend of work. And, with all of that said, I think most are just reading the PDF version, or using the static nbviewer rendering, not running it locally on their machine. Heck, that is how I read the other IPython books - in nbviewer or PDF form. You know what you can do in PDF that you can&#x27;t do in Jupyter? Search. I can ctrl+f in a PDF and search an entire book; in Jupyter, which has no concept of a &#x27;book&#x27;, I have to go from notebook to notebook.<p>Anyway, I welcome ideas on how to approach this. I come from a world of C++ where code I wrote in 1995 is still running today, and still compiles with the latest compilers. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not approaching this problem optimally due to lack of experience in web based mediums. But I do fear, not unreasonably, that once I move on the book will become essentially inaccessible in just 10-20 years or so.",1425908922

Clojure S-expressions provide a superset of JSON and Clojure&#x27;s eval allows you to define a function to compute certain values. It&#x27;s an escape hatch so that you&#x27;re configuration files don&#x27;t need to become accidentally Turing complete. The Turing complete nature of your configuration files is well defined as Clojure.<p>I had posted a while back wondering why more formats do not just derive from sexp or SXML (yes, say that out loud in the office). As I think some Lispers (I am even below beginner) cannot help but notice that if sexpr are coincidentally (I am sure it can be done without, but still, I am not sure if McCarthy and company just started with sexp or choose it specifically and held their ground beyond it was their choice) core to the lisp&#x27;s homoiconic power-features, why more people do not just want sexp as the core data definiton, keep the data and program as close as possible, and just macro the data back, tossing back and forth between code and data as the division is limited.<p>Anyway, I like that far more intelligent people than me not only like this idea, but are encouraging it and pushing it forward.<p>(Yes, flame away.

Instead of makefiles I simply add files to a project. Instead of resolving conflicts between packages and chasing down obsolete libraries you just double-click setup.exe. Instead of a rookie &quot;corrupting&quot; your Git master with a rebase, you have them adding, committing, pushing, pulling, undoing and checking out.<p>If anyone were to see the lack of functionality in the GitVS as embarrassing they would most certainly be correct: it&#x27;s embarrassment for Git itself.",1425907629

If you&#x27;re deeply entrenched in imperative-style coding and are just missing familiarity with - what&#x27;s that other word? Prescriptive programming? - then by all means, you want to get down with it and get some practice. Set yourself some &quot;toy&quot; tasks and learn by doing until you&#x27;re familiar with the concepts and effects. But meh, maybe after 6 years you&#x27;ve been way down that route.<p>Something I&#x27;ve found helpful is to interact with a good HTML/CSS debugger such as the one in Chrome. You can highlight a chunk of your output page and see how the CSS comes together at various levels to create the final look of it. IIRC Chrome even lets you change those settings on the fly in the browser to experiment.<p>On the other hand, you have my complete sympathy insofar as I find that model very cumbersome in a few places. It feels to me like something designed by a committee, and one very intent on reducing CPU load. There are things I can do with the table model, especially stuff like proportional columns or regions whose dimension is a constant +/- a product, that are like pulling teeth with the CSS layout model. There&#x27;s a reason there are huge collections of &quot;tricks&quot; advice on how to do these things, which should IMO be obvious to a &quot;programmer&quot; type if they actually were.<p>On the other hand, maybe you just need to let go. TeX especially is highly opinionated about how it slaps text on a page, and allegedly those are the opinions of experts in the field. So if your output is not looking like your mental model of the expected output, maybe your mistake is being so specific in your expectations? Both CSS and TeX allow you to micromanage your output more or less down to the pixel level, but very often I&#x27;m quite glad to let the layout engine do its job while I do the rest of mine.",1425906306

834179,comment,833882,834111,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Interesting.<p>I absolutely suck at math, and I blame the computer. Here's why :) :<p>When I was a kid I was good at 'arithmetic' in school (grade school, I really wouldn't call it math). Anything up to say raising stuff to arbitrary powers and doing lots of multiplications, long division up to fairly high numbers without pencil and paper.<p>Then high school came along. In the first year I was probably the best of all the kids at math, it didn't cost me any effort either, trigonometry and so on was a breeze. I liked doing it, the teacher was great. Then in the second year of high school we got a fairly lousy teacher (sorry, it's the truth, especially when compared to the guy from the first year), and I got access to a computer.<p>That changed everything. Computers were so much more fun than math yet somehow related that my interest in mathematics dropped like a stone and my interest in computers went through the roof. After that mathematics never managed to wrest my attention away from coding long enough to make it count.<p>Even today I have an almost untouched calculus course sitting on my bookshelves that I've been planning to work my way through 'one of these days' for the last decade or so.<p>Programming is just too much fun.<p>I know I'd be a better programmer though, with more math under my belt, so maybe, one of these days...",1253519862

If you do this on a production server then you might end up seeking back and forth across the disk all the time.<p>Alter tables are pretty bad, there is a quick way to do them though, here is how:<p>- create new table, right structure, no keys<p>- load data in it
  (now you should have a .MYD)<p>- create table with all keys defined, copy the .frm and .MYI files over the ones of the .MYD above<p>- flush tables
  (don't forget this, alternatively you can shut down mysql at this point and use the my*chk tool with the -r option to recreate your indexes)<p>- repair table

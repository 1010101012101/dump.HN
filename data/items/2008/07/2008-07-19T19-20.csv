250835,comment,250649,250718,0,0,ken,,,"I believe that statement (the first half, anyway) is simply not true.  X11 is capable of displaying different windows at different color depths.  Look at the ""int depth"" parameter to XCreateWindow, or run xwininfo(1) and check out the ""Depth:"" line.<p>Today I suspect it's not used much, if at all.  When you've got a 256MB video card, what's a few extra bytes?  Modern graphics cards might not even support this.<p>But I believe that 15 or 20 years ago, this feature actually did get used.  You'd have a depth=24 root window, and a depth=4 (say) hardware overlay for things like the mouse cursor and popup menus, because they didn't really need a lot of colors, and you don't want to redraw your expensive graphics every time you moved the mouse.<p>Of course, everybody thought that dealing with hardware overlays and custom colormaps everywhere was a royal pain for application developers (and it was), so we came up with higher-level toolkits like GTK+ which make it really easy to splat up a window without caring about this, and it'll just use depth=24 (or whatever you've got) everywhere, and we've got tons of video memory so nobody cares anyway.<p>I'm not saying X11 was particularly <i>good</i> at this, but it did support this particular feature.",1216497443

250825,comment,250704,250749,0,0,mlinsey,,,"For number (6), I've been thinking about something in a similar area but a different take.  The whole journal system itself is broken.  My university's Math & CS library dropped its subscriptions to several journals a few years ago because they cost too much.  Even though they picked the least important/prestigious journals, at one of the top CS departments in the country, this should not happen.  And this is to say nothing of a lone individual who wants to benefit from research and teach himself some of it. They can hardly pay to subscribe to any of these journals.<p>And think about what a journal provides:  a forum for researchers to submit the results of their research and a mechanism for selecting which of the submissions are worthwhile for folks in the field to know about.<p>What I just described is essentially just a karma system, albeit you would have to find a way to take the credibility of the rater into serious consideration.   Assuming you solved the chicken-and-egg problem of getting enough credible people from academia to be raters and to submit their best work to your site (quite a tough problem considering many large universities are much more like big companies, or worse government bureaucracies, than startups), you could totally replace the entire system of academic journals.<p>Think of all the other free extras you would get by having a web app host all journal articles: at minimum, the process of citing references and looking at the background of a paper could be improved: you could visually trace the findings of the paper you're looking at all the way back to the founding of the field by what each of it's references used as references. Search would be a lot better, as would recommendation engines (lots of professors have grad students waste time simply scanning journals for articles that are relevant for their work).  If you're into NLP than you would have a much better dataset and a clear application for doing summarization.  And think about the possibilities of social networking or productivity-app type features enabling all sorts of new possibilities for collaboration among people at different universities!<p>But the real big play is that once you do all this, you're well on your way to replacing universities themselves, which any undergraduate can tell you are bloated enterprises which spend large amounts of money and pass the costs onto their customers, who accept it because the university system has a monopoly on giving out credentials for people going into the working world.<p>One of universities main products is research, and in many fields (biology, physics) you need the big backing of university (and government) dollars to support research.  In many other fields (math, Computer Science, philosophy) you don't.  Researchers in these fields usually need to somehow pay their living expenses, and the actual equipment expenses are minimal.  They mainly need: 
-a place to find like-minded collaborators
-credibility for their work (ie, ability to publish in journals).
You could give them both of those things.  Now people in these fields wouldn't even need to choose the career path of grad school and then professorship (in other words, staying their entire life in the university monopoly) in order to contribute their research to humanity's body of knowledge.<p>So in other words, what you need is to build a HN/Reddit style voting/peer review system that weights the credibility of the voter heavily. Then you need to find some early adopters who are credible enough to lend your own site credibility. Then you could be well on your way to reinventing the academy in a way that is much more democratic and makes its results much more widely available and usable by the public.<p>Anyone want to build this? My email address is in my profile.  Or just go ahead and use this idea yourself - I just really want to be able to use this service somehow, though probably more as a consumer than a producer of research. Maybe someone who actually went to grad school and had lots of papers published themselves would be in a better position to build this idea.",1216496687

I a have an idea for a startup, and I am deciding on which technologies to use.

And 99.9% of anything <i>too</i> new (as you put it) is likely also wrong. And when something <i>too</i> new does manage to pass through the filter and (god forbid) become fashionable we're in serious trouble. Just take a look at String ""Theory"" decades of work by arguably some of the best brains in the world and absolutely nothing significant to show for it.<p>Now, don't get me wrong. The review process is far from perfect, and just the reviewer selection process can have a lot of influence (at least until an automatic method is adopted say, like <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605112</a>). However, I don't think making the reviews public would improve anything. In fact, it would probably make it worse by conditioning (directly or indirectly) your career progression by the ""yes-man"" reviews you give. The reason reviewers are anonymous is to prevent undo pressure from being exerted on them, and to give them the privacy necessary for them to be completely honest.",1216495728

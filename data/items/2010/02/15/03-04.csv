(The official position of the American government for over a generation now has been that increasing home ownership is, ipso facto, socially desirable.  It is a cornerstone of the ""American Dream"" -- our consensus idealized version of an idyllic middle class existence.  )<p>Mortgage interest is a bit different than other one-off tax code hacks in that the group which benefits is much, much larger than typical.  It is also essentially impossible to repeal, as the mortgage interest deduction essentially makes mortgages cheaper which makes property values higher, so repealing it would have the immediate consequence of making half the country poorer and also breaking their monthly budgets in an extraordinarily visible fashion.<p>A similar middle-class entitlement is the essentially limitless access to education loans.  That also has some negative consequences (it underwrites the continual tuition inflation in higher education) and will also never be meaningfully reigned in.<p>[Edited to add: A common misconception, even among Americans, is that the IRS sets tax policy.  The IRS does not set tax policy.  Congress does, via legislation.  The IRS just implements Congress' directives -- however vague, contradictory, and ill-advised they may be.

As an entrepreneur, I can definitely speak for the benefits that Stanford GSB provides:\n(1) The Stanford and Stanford GSB networks are both phenomenal. Alumni are very accessible and connected with the school. Classmates are highly collaborative and bring contacts from almost every industry you can think of and want to learn about. To start a business, access to relevant networks is critical and GSB provides that.\n(2) Entrepreneurship classes taught by experienced industry veterans. Some of my favorite classes are taught by serial entrepreneurs, famous venture capitalists, or legendary executives including Eric Schmidt, Andy Grove, Mark Leslie, Andy Rachleff, Audrey MacLean, Mike Lyons, Joe Peterson, and Harold Irving Grousbeck, among many others. \n(3) The roster of speakers that come to speak both at GSB and other parts of Stanford is extremely useful for entrepreneurs. Classes and clubs invite speakers including Ron Conway, Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey (founder of Twitter), Shawn Fanning (founder of Napster), Chad Hurley (founder of Youtube), Aaron Patzer (founder of Mint.com), Mark Pincus (founder of Zynga), and many others. STVP (stvp.stanford.edu) and ETL (etl.stanford.edu) are two other great resources. As a student, you can even take the initiative as a club leader to approach some of the most successful people in the valley to come speak. \n(4) Stanford GSB has a Center for Entrepreneurial Studies which organizes seasoned entrepreneurs, angels and venture investors to hold 1:1 free advisory sessions with entrepreneurial students to discuss their startup ideas and help students build the network. I've personally found them very valuable.\n(5) Many successful alumni who are entrepreneurs, active angels, or venture investors often hold intimate networking events, such as as small group dinners, to meet with entrepreneurial students. It's another way to network and receive feedback on your startup idea!\n(6) The school also offers classes in which students across business school, engineering school and other schools can work in a team on a startup idea together. Some of these class projects continued as startups after the class.<p>Overall, the best value is the access to investor, entrepreneur and industry networks, the ability to meet other entrepreneurial students, and to receive advice from some of the best entrepreneurs in the industry.",1266203403

The Daily Mail has made their position on this issue very clear, and has shown that they will lie and cheat to embarrass scientists at every turn. Since their reporting here does not cite original sources, the article simply cannot be taken at face value. Even if they were being completely honest here, one scientist saying something to a reporter does not contradict the massive body of peer-reviewed studies demonstrating AGW. What it would show at the absolute worst is that you have a scientist that is willing to say stupid shit in front of a microphone. In order to support your claim, you would need at the very least to show that long-term warming has not occurred, or that if it has, it is completely natural. Since both such claims run counter to all that we know about the climate, you would need a lot of data on temperature records, CO2 levels, etc. and to convince us as to why all collected data is invalid.",1266203171

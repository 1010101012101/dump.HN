369340,comment,369337,369337,0,0,qhoxie,,,"The site seems very functional.  I do have two comments:<p>- It is _very_ congested.  There is too much text to be able to focus.  More whitespace and less text will help.<p>- How is this distinct from Digg, Reddit, etc?  What do you do to differentiate your site?",1227088128

I read a little, but didn't\nget the point that the URL would link direct.  I thought\na URL in the text would auto-link, as per a wiki, but\nit didn't do what I thought.  Mea culpa.<p>Next time ...",1227087841

It's entertaining reading, but like most business books, the meat of it, sans anecdotes, could fit in a few pages.  And sometimes the 'meat' is sort of dubious in any case.<p>... and thus...

There are many, many companies where what goes on your machine is what the company chooses.  You are either forbidden, or prevented, from installing anything else.<p>Those people are forced to use Outlook.<p>Also, your average employee is unlikely to replace Outlook with the 'better' solution of extracting calendar information using 'gnus using elisp'.",1227087323

369329,comment,368355,368355,0,0,mikkom,,,"I think taking down the site was a bad idea, after reading your article, I would have bought it (my pain treshold for random purchases goes somewhere around $20 so if you decide to sell it for under that, please drop a notice).<p>I'm an entrepreneur myself (We sold our company to a quite big company about 1,5 years ago), I think what really went wrong was not the product, niche or anything like that. It was the marketing/sales. You should never underestimate how hard selling even a good product is.<p>also, this kind of a product will never ""get old"", the principles behind it will be the same forever so if it's good and you get enough people who purchase, you will get snowball effect by mouth to mouth marketing.<p>I think the worst decision you made was to waste your work when you took the site down. I also think your name is awful, it's so generic that it's hard to even find using google so what I would do is to republish the program with catchy name and add a link from your blog.<p>Also it's not a bad idea to hang in places like digitalpoint forums and hire some indian to submit your tool to X directories, that will cost you about $10-20 and you will get a lot of google goodness.<p>edit: you are giving it free now? Okay suits me but I would have bought it. How about adding at least a donation button?",1227085713

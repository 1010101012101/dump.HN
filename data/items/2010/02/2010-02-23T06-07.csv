Surgery, and brain surgery in particular, has a lot more in common with the 19th century than the 21st.

1144893,comment,1144354,1144354,0,0,halostatue,,,"Yes, online recipe ratings are broken, which is why I don't pay attention to them. Of course, I'm a fairly good cook, so I know how to look at a recipe and tell whether it makes sense or not. Often, I'll end up with 60% of one recipe, 15% of another, 10% of a third, and 15% my own experience to pull together a recipe for a dish I want to try to make.<p>If you're looking for something on how to make a dish (like I did recently for baguettes) and find several recipes to choose from, I find a few things make it easy to choose from:<p>1. Real, individual ingredients are better than composite ingredients (that is, flour, baking soda, oil, etc. rather than Bisquick™).
2. Simpler recipes are usually better than complex recipes, especially if you've never made the dish before. There are exceptions, of course. (I'm <i>certain</i> that the King Arthur baguette recipe that I found would be better than the one that I tried, but it requires making a sourdough starter some fourteen hours in advance. I will try it some day.)
3. Well-written descriptions suggest better recipes. This is a bit like code comments, though—there is such a thing as too much description.
4. Recipes that depend on exact timing of multiple pots and pans are probably not a good idea to experiment with if you're not already good at making similar dishes.<p>That said, I'd pay attention to recipe ratings if there were only two yes/no questions: I made this; I'd make it again. Report the resulting value as a simple ratio of (repeat)/(made once). Seriously, I don't make recipes more than once if I wasn't enthusiastic about the results or weren't convinced that I could make it better by changing the ingredients or cooking instructions better. I don't know anyone who does. Star ratings are a waste of time.",1266907389

1144882,comment,1144390,1144753,0,0,lmkg,,,"You're not exactly making assumptions about the level of detail. You're making assumptions about the compressibility and entropy of the data. A circle requires the same amount of data to represent whether its radius is R or 2R[1]. L1-minimization tries to find the smallest number of circles regardless of size, whereas traditional compression methods look for the largest circles regardless of number. It attempts to minimize the entropy of the result image (roughly), and all real pictures that aren't literally static have low entropy.<p>A saw a presentation on this technique in college. Some of the details I saw escaped me, but one thing I remember is that the L1 decompression is optimal when it is ""orthogonal"" to the compression that it is reversing. Fourier-based compression schemes (including JPEG and MPEG, and even MP3) are ""orthogonal"" in the correct sense because they select based on size, preserving large structures better. Random sampling is ""orthogonal"" to basically all compression schemes, and tends to select more information from large structures as well.<p>With a high-res bazilion-dollar space telescope, you're not going to throw away 80% of the pixels and reconstruct an approximation. Rather, you'll take all of the recorded pixels, and then reconstruct even more impressive astronomer porn at five times the resolution!<p>[1] Well, close enough. If you store the circle as the (x,y) of the center and an integer radius R, then 2R takes 1 more bit. Storing R as floating-point means no difference.

I'm guessing that somewhere lost in the journalism is the suggestion that its better to place more computation on the decompression, which might be true in some application.<p>It seems like a great bit of technology, I don't think the author needed to sex it up with mention of compressing images. The applications where its actually hard to do sensing at all (like the MRI example in the article) are much more compelling. It seems like its main use seems to be in turning sparse data into its most human friendly form, but I do wonder about making clinical decisions based on such an aggressive interpolation rather than actual data.",1266904957

I would've liked CBC to have Olympic coverage though, as it's the only Canadian channel broadcast in the Seattle/Puget Sound area.

These skills are not required, and sometimes don't exist in the lone founder.<p>The big difference, I think, is that if you have all the equity, really all that matters is your will and ability to go on.  Sure, your employees, friends, spouse, etc... are incredibly important, but dealing with a friend, spouse or employee is a rather different thing from dealing with a cofounder",1266904863

I personally don't want to fill out a massive questionnaire (even 5 questions may be too many) just to rate something, usually these fixed axises don't always fit what I want to say either.  People seem to respond well to a simple rating and a free-form paragraph, both as readers and reviewers -- what is the incentive for the person writing the detailed review to actually write it?  All the data needs to be boiled down to a single yes or no in the mind of the reader trying to make a decision anyway.",1266904863

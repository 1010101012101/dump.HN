Very good programmers will often be very busy and never get a chance to open source any of their work.<p>I have so many open source things I'd like to work on, but I am full time employed and when I am done with work I go running, reading books, eating out, anything other than sitting in front of a computer. And I think I'm a better programmer for it.<p>This is why I find claims that this proves ""passion"" about programming very dubious.<p>Now I do happen to have a source forge profile, from an old job that paid me to work on an open source but not free product. It was a critical piece of infrastructure and my job was to do some very tricky things to it.<p>Every time I've given people a link to my profile and my patches or commit history on that project, they realize they in no way shape or form have the time or energy to grok this huge, old and complex C++ code base, to be able to evaluate my changes to it. Oops!<p>I end up giving them trivial python scripts I've written in an afternoon.<p>Also, a twitter account is definite positive? Really?<p>#3. Yes!

I've worked often with contractors who have been very impressive. We almost often make then a great offer to join our team as full time employees. They always easily decline with a smile.<p>Because they are happy being hired guns, and don't want to go back to being employees.<p>Now suppose a candidate is willing and able to do this, but what happens when some other company makes them a great offer which doesn't require a week long contracting gig first?<p>I've been given great offers hours after walking out of the first in-person interview. Unless I am passionately, madly in love with the idea of working for your company, I will not bother. I would bother if I had no other offers, but are you hiring the best then?<p>And what if the candidate is looking to switch jobs, but professional ethics prevent him from slacking at this current time intensive job? Would they do your contracting thing? What if they don't, but they are in fact far and away the best developer?<p>I've been in that exact siltation, I've taken vacation days to do in-person interviews. But I would not take a week long contracting job just to get to the face to face interview.<p>#6. Unless sales is part of the job I wouldn't want ""pitching"".

The ARMv6 chipset is old, its virtually tagged/indexed caches have a plethora of cache aliasing issues that reflect to workarounds in linux kernel and shared libraries in userspace. You have to maintain an entire ARMv6 distro for this arch. I would personally not use anything non ARMv7, because all these issues are resolved in ARMv7.<p>So its quite natural Ubuntu did not want to allocate a team of 100k/year engineers for raspberry pi, and protect its brand also.<p>For the curious, if you map the same physical address to 2 virtual addresses, and both happen to be in the cache, you have 2 virtual entries in the cache for the same address, so which one to flush back to RAM is ambiguous. Its a problem specific to virtually addressed caches. Solution: a lot of restrictions to avoid aliasing and you flush the caches too often to avoid aliasing etc.",1331047669

It seems to make a lot of sense: 80% of the people use 20% of the features. So you convince yourself that you only need to implement 20% of the features, and you can still sell 80% as many copies.<p>Unfortunately, it's never the same 20%. Everybody uses a different set of features. In the last 10 years I have probably heard of dozens of companies who, determined not to learn from each other, tried to release ""lite"" word processors that only implement 20% of the features. This story is as old as the PC. Most of the time, what happens is that they give their program to a journalist to review, and the journalist reviews it by writing their review using the new word processor, and then the journalist tries to find the ""word count"" feature which they need because most journalists have precise word count requirements, and it's not there, because it's in the ""80% that nobody uses,"" and the journalist ends up writing a story that attempts to claim simultaneously that lite programs are good, bloat is bad, and I can't use this damn thing 'cause it won't count my words.""",1331047669

But if you think it's just to prevent blowing your speakers, that's OK.<p>The reason that square wave sucks is because it introduces tons of high frequency content (your amp probably won't reproduce the high frequency content anyway, so I don't think most Japanese consumer amps will damage your speakers--that is, the amp will act like a filter anyway).  That high frequency content then creates alias effects (think of moire patterns when looking at super high-res photos that are scaled down without anti-aliasing).  Those alias effects sound like shit to the human ear.<p>The point of filtering is to anti-alias the resulting analog signal after conversion from digital to analog.  The point of upsampling is to move that filter well beyond the audible range, so you can use a 1st-order filter (gentle slope, but it introduces no phase effects).  The fact that a square wave hurts your speakers is inconsequential--the amp will effectively filter the signal anyway.  Unfortunately, it will filter the signal without anti-aliasing, which introduces those nasty interference patterns within the audible spectrum (that is, if you feed a straight 44.1KHz sampled square wave to your speakers without upsampling/filtering).",1331047665

I shouldn't have to fly to Dallas to sue Pizza Hut if my local franchise poisoned me.<p>That said, the Internet breaks down a lot of established jurisdictional law because a website can operate effectively anywhere the Internet exists, and as such can theoretically be subject to the laws of any web-connected jurisdiction. These seizures are just another example of how the law has not caught up to the basic operating procedures of the web.<p>There is a certain legal philosophy that says the Internet is operating under its own version of Maritime Law, which is to say its a non-national zone where the law is defined by consensus practice and then ratified by bordering or participating jurisdictions.

All the popular languages have package management tools that far surpass PHP's, with NPM and Ruby Gems being the most popular of the bunch. To say that packages and frameworks exist because core PHP is lacking isn't wholly correct. Packages and frameworks exist because they increase developer productivity and help to avoid recreation of the wheel on subsequent projects. While the concept of a STL-like layer is appealing, I fear it'd be hard to find widespread support. It'd be great to see the community get behind some core OOP libs for routing, request, response, auth, etc. The problem is the powers that be over at PHP.net are pretty set in their ways. This would have to be something that side-steps that altogether. The more approachable solution is to mimic NPM and Ruby Gems, allowing the community to help curate packages over github and decide which tools are appropriate for specific jobs via reviews, download counts, word of mouth, etc. It's definitely not perfect, but opens the doors for increased user contributions.<p>Anything that increases the friendliness and usability of PHP is a win for the community since the language isn't perceived in the greatest of light. The only way to combat the negative perceptions is to prove people wrong by making continuous improvements and keeping up growing web requirements.",1331046151

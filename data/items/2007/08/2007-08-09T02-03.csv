I think many of your questions would answer themselves one way or another after you start designing. But I'll take a stab. I'll skip 2 because I don't watch so much TV, reason being that in most cases, reading is the fastest way of absorbing information.<p>1. of course they are meaningful, because I know the people. The ties they create are digital. For those that bond with their friends online, FB facilitates it. For those that don't there's no difference (I'm in this group). I don't expose much of myself nor edit my profile much because I don't think it's worth the effort.<p>3. This problem I'm particularly interested in.
The idea that services like these attract the LCD is a result of their design and not of operation. I think it is possible to circumvent this problem, but you must change the design concept.<p>I recently attended the Wikimania conference and they talked about the absurd complexity of the rules now applied to Wikipedia. The oldies were talking about ""back in the day"" just like the old diggers. Spawning a new Wikipedia-like system isn't going to work; Citizendium is not the answer. You can spawn a new digg and it would still face the same problems. You can talk about spawning a new news.yc for non-startup content, and assuming it gets popular, it would still run into quality control problems. Plus, pg has a sizeable following, but there is only one of him: unless he clones himself for the new site, or creates a different system, his divested energy will result in one being less active than the other.<p>A community news site that handles 10K users isn't going to handle 1M users similarly just by scaling the system or by implementing friends and leaders. There's that rule of 150 written in the Tipping Point book that says any group exceeding about 150 members will become difficult to manage(I shouldn't cite Gladwell but it's not an unfounded idea). A site of thousands of active members will, of course, run into management problems, but with a 10:90 active:lurker ratio, it works ok when your site has up to perhaps 20k users before you see any substantial, visible change in focus. Since not every user is active at the same time of day, you can increase the size of the virtual community, perhaps to something like 300 core members before the content changes dramatically.<p>I don't know digg's numbers, but taking wikipedia as an example, with thousands of active editors, of course you will run into problems! And they think it's a result of lack of consensus over what is acceptible behavior or something.<p>Seems pretty obvious to me, and I welcome challengers. When I said this at the conference nobody seemed to buy it though.",1186628135

Cubic meters, no problem. Cubic knots, even cubic rods, anything you want.<p>But cubic acres? Now that's just getting crazy. Acres measure area, so not exactly sure what a ""cubic acre"" would be. I suppose it could be a cube with 1 acre each side, but man, that's pushing it :).",1186627828

I suspect that the performance is similar, yet I also suspect that a $900 display-less iMac would blow the Dell out of the water, with the drastically lower support costs. ",1186626951

40730,comment,40616,40666,0,0,adamsmith,,,"Raising more than 10x at a time can be like putting rocket fuel in your Vespa.  If you burn through it then you're probably going to quickly.  If you just keep it in the bank then you probably should have raised less.<p>How can you grow too fast?  Growing takes away options and forces you to commit earlier to larger projects.  If you're cheap and burning low then you can have multiple shots at the target.  If you have a 300k/month burn then you better have the right target in your scope.<p>Why might it make sense to raise less rather than save it in the bank?  There are a few inflection points in the value of a company over time.  You release your product, and your valuation goes up 5x.  You reach breakeven, the valuation goes up another 3x, etc.  You want to time your raising money (and the amounts) so that you get money when it's the cheapest for you.<p>If it cost $x to reach the recent proof point then it's rare for the cost of the next proof point to be > $(10)x.",1186626448
40729,comment,40690,40690,0,0,morselsrule,,,"1) Facebook is useful to me in order to a) always have up to date contact information b) have a central place where I can browse photos and c) have a quick introduction to new people that I friend, and see what they are into d) and keep tabs on what all my weak connections are up to.   I don't have any major issues with Facebook.<p>2)  I'm selective about what I watch, so I don't browse YouTube.  I watch the Daily Show and selected PBS  documentaries online.  Occaisionally I rent a movie from Amazon Unbox, but the selection is terrible.  I use NetFlix to watch old The Wire and West Wing episodes.  I wish I could watch those shows online, but they are not available.<p>3)  I wish there was a small niche news site for thoughtful political commentary and policy analysis (as opposed to the endless ranting on reddit).  New.ycombinator and programming.reddit.com are great for my programming, business, and startup news.<p>

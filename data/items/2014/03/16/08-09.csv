Or not.  I see you or someone else constantly retorting with &quot;Why not Pandoc?&quot; and I agree with you.  I started to get interest in Haskell again just because Pandoc, and Gitit, and some other very impressive stuff, is written in Haskell and seems to do some stuff very powerfully.<p>However, a caveat.  It is not mentioned in the documentation, but Gitit does not enable PDF export by default, when Pandoc is more than capable of doing so?  Why?  Because, in all fairness, it can add significant load.  According to the conf file comments.<p>> pdf-export: yes<p>> # if yes, PDF will appear in export options. PDF will be created using<p>> # pdflatex, which must be installed and in the path. Note\nthat PDF<p>> # exports create significant additional server load.<p>How much load, I am not sure.  I would love to see a similar Happstack app like this program that runs gitit or the new fork gitit2, rewritten for Happstack updates now that the API has matured.  This makes me think performance is an issue.<p>As an aside, I know ShareLatex opened up their code.  I have not had time to check, but I was curious if they do use standard Latex for generating files and if they do, how they make it performant (I know they have a couple layers, I watched their old Node/JS London talk, I mean hear Latex in particular) so fast for potentially thousands of people at once.<p>[0] <a href=""https://gitprint.com/jgm/gitit/blob/master/README.markdown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitprint.com/jgm/gitit/blob/master/README.markdown</a>",1394959574

It&#x27;s problematic that women in tech are much more likely to experience this than men (because of gender ratios and men tending to be more forward), and that the power dynamics and implicit threat of violence will also tend to be worse when women are the recipients of the attention.<p>Given this, having your first response be to ask <i>her</i> to be empathetic is ridiculous. Do we ask the victims of shootings to empathize with the perpetrators who had mental illness, had absentee parents, grew up poor, etc? Sometimes these issues come up in the wake of tragedies, and they are an important part of understanding the problem.<p>But the <i>victim</i> is the absolute last person to ask the be empathetic. She has an unquestionable right to feel personally safe and to do her work without others hostilely inhibiting her. When someone infringes on that, she&#x27;s already being unfairly burdened. It&#x27;s completely unfair to further burden her with an imperative to be understanding of what lead him to be the kind of person that would do that, rather than take every measure to remedy the situation, and to call out GitHub for failing to adequately do so.<p>Yes, it would be great if everyone empathized with those who wrong them. But until it becomes commonplace for people to show understanding toward people who mug them on the street because anyone willing to risk their safety and freedom for a few hundred dollars has likely hard a very hard life rather than reporting it to the police and seeking their imprisonment, let&#x27;s focus on big, clear concerns: What he did to her was completely unacceptable, and if GitHub failed to quickly take action to end it and ensure it would not happen again, they deserve to be publicly shamed.",1394959092

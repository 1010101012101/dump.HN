But I don't think you can draw a causal factor from one to the other, that 3D headsets were a product failure because of harm to children, without introducing more evidence.<p>There are alternative stories that can explain why 3D headsets, in particular, failed, independent of SRI tests etc.<p>Computers were much slower, and the visual update speed (presuming gyroscopic control) likely lagged the rendered 3D view quite badly - and IMHO this is a much worse problem that could cause motion sickness, but need not apply to 3D video displayed on a flat surface in a fixed position relative to the viewer.<p>3D headsets also have significant usability and social use problems. They may be heavy, tiring to wear, bulky, tedious to transport, geeky and exclusionary to use. They may even leave one open to practical jokes, as they may act like a blindfold; or unpleasant surprises. I know my gf hates it when I surprise her when she's wearing headphones.<p>3D video, meanwhile, normally requires that everyone wear special glasses. That's a fad that gets tired pretty quickly, and turns TV into a more binary watching / not-watching experience.<p>Personally, I'm not particularly afraid of gaze focusing issues arising from 3D video. I am, however, quite skeptical that it will ever be more than a gimmick that fades after a year or two of hype, while it still has accessory and viewing angle requirements.",1277686374

I'd say that Search, Maps/Earth, GMail, and probably a couple others I'm forgetting are all best-in-class products that were revelatory when they came out.  Chrome isn't revelatory, but I'd certainly shortlist it for best browser.<p>What the author is responding to, and validly (albeit overzealously) so, is a presumption some have that Google can do no wrong.  The fact is that most of Google's products aren't much to write home about.  Outside their core group of awesome products, Google has been beaten time and again by tiny startups (YouTube is probably the foremost example).

1466633,comment,1466166,1466166,0,0,barrkel,,,"First up, strabismus implies you're primarily using your dominant eye, and ignoring input from the other eye. In this state, 3D vision based on different inputs to each eye won't do anything for you. If you weren't solid on eye gaze coordination for 3D perception before viewing 3D video, I can maybe buy that it increases the risk that you don't settle in properly. But if you do have eye gaze coordination already, I would believe that 3D vision you can easily track - i.e. alter your gaze point appropriately to coordinate images from both eyes - would not impair this skill, and may even improve it.<p>I played around with stereograms a bunch when I was 12 or so. I got to making my own using graph paper, creating a random dot pattern, and then carefully repeating it with adjustments to generate the desired depth cues when viewed with crossed vision - the near approach - or parallel vision, the far approach.<p>So, I did this for many, many hours over a period of weeks. The most practical upshot - if you can call it practical - is that I'm now extremely good at ""spot the difference"" puzzles, as I can change the intersection point of my eye gaze at will, even to the point of infinity (parallel gaze) and slightly beyond (so that my eyes are actually looking outward in slightly different directions). The practice of conscious control also decouples corneal focusing from gaze direction as desired.<p>Another slight plus is that I find it reasonably easy to relax my eyes, putting on a ""1000 yard stare"", including distance-focusing my eyes. I often do this when I'm sitting by the computer, but caught up in thought. FWIW, I'm slightly short-sighted, but have experienced no loss in visual acuity in 20 years of almost entirely indoor, close computer work.<p>I feel pretty confident from my personal experience in saying that I'm not afraid that there will be any side-effects from 3D video.

Clojure has access to all the Java APIs, and with pure Java goodies such as drivers for Oracle, SQLite, SQLServer, it's easy to write code that runs well across Mac, Windows and GNU/Linux. None of this stuff needs an IDE, since by and large, just dropping .class files into an appropriate folder is most of the battle in Java/Clojure.",1277684824

Consider Apple's early beginnings, all urban legends and anecdotes aside. Apple found initial success by providing ""beautiful"" products that were built so virtually any user could handle them - they offered simple, clean functionality, as embodied by the user-interface and the original Apple Mouse for navigation.<p>Further, consider all of the Apple commercials from recent history - ""I'm a Mac v. I'm a PC"" - each episode was based on an implied simplicity (function) and beauty of Macs, as opposed to their clunky and confusing PC rivals. Apple has since pulled those commercials in favor of a new angle - perhaps, to your point, something that will focus not on function, but on aesthetic appeal alone going forward.<p>To your point regarding AT&T, I agree that they are not solely to blame here. The dropped call problem with the iPhone 4 is certainly a design flaw, not one to be blamed on the carrier - though problems with AT&T are not to be ignored completely either.<p>I would not be surprised if further design flaws emerge around the iPhone 4 in the coming months, but I believe that these speak more to my point here that Apple has neglected its promise for equal parts function and beauty.<p>...And as an aside, I was spurred to write the original post when I realized that the iPhone 4 received all of the really neat features that I had expected and wanted to see in the iPad.

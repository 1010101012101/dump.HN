A quickie incorporation is fine if you are intending to start as a sole founder and anticipate remaining that way. If you plan to add a founding team and anticipate needing a more sophisticated set-up, then you should be more cautious about doing it right from the start (we often get ""instacorps"" brought in for such repair jobs and, yes, it is true, it can cost more to repair them than it would have to do it right in the first place).<p>Great pieces by the way (I don't want to come across as just a critic - my points really touch on your argument at the edges, I think).",1266886732

Ironically we <i>are</i> doing that right now, but for a dual-license scheme (GPL/Proprietary).<p>The reason we didn't choose LGPL for the relicense is because one of the main devs (not me) refused; he saw releasing the source as LGPL to be effectively throwing away any chance to ever make any money off of his work, while keeping the code as GPL would at least reserve that option for the future.

1144228,comment,1144112,1144112,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I don't know, Andrew. I think there are two questions here. You asked our opinion, so here goes.<p>1) What charging model drives the most quality and response from readers? (This seems to be the crux of the argument from your blog)<p>2) How do I, as a startup founder, get the most from the internet and how do you fit into the picture? If I have to pay for material, why would your material be any better than, say, a few books, free videos, or making friends with other cofounders on a place like HN?<p>It very well may be that you had 6,900 viewers of the PG interview, but here's the dirty little secret nobody talks about enough over here: there's about 500 tire-kicker, wannabe entrepreneurs for every real one. Probably a lot more. So your ""audience"" is probably largely consisting of people who like learning as much as they can without actually doing very much. The get a certain cachet out of participating in your interviews.<p>If that's the case, then I say target those people: work towards more and more famous people and more and more quasi-in-depth interviews. Charge for older material. Set up a ""Gold Ring"" Entrepreneurs Circle or some other premium brand. This puts you in the startup media business, just like book sellers or the pay-for-feedback guys.<p>However from my end I think we'll part ways here, at least as far as your paid service goes. Startups have about a thousand different facets and I need to know just enough about each of them but not too much. That means I need instantaneous feedback and a conversation, not an hour-long video from famous person X on how tough it was ten years ago to make their first million. That works great for mass media, but I need to know how to roll out a beta of a social networking site on a limited budget. I need to be able to ask questions about specifics around this topic and I need to know it within the next couple of hours. HN gives me that immediate feedback, and as the amount of material on HN grows, I get all sorts of historical information in easily-searched text format without having to pay anything at all.<p>Hope that makes some sense to you.",1266886175

1144172,comment,1142927,1144139,0,0,ajju,,,"Actually I have been on both sides of the table on an H-1B visa, so I am quite certain that I am not underestimating the cost of the H1B visa. The government fees are $2320 for a non-expedited application and $3320 for an expedited application. Lawyers usually charge $1000. Although this, obviously, will vary by firm and seniority of the lawyer in question.<p>The narrow job description and advertisements are applicable only to the green card where the total cost would probably reach over $8000, but again it is often shared by the employee and the employer. The job description is a few hours of work by an immigration paralegal or lawyer and  newspaper ads should not increase the cost by much more.<p>I don't want the H1B system to be something it is not, the government has already muddled the intent of the system by allowing H1Bs to apply for greencards. In fact it is probably the only practical way of getting a green card as a skilled immigrant, but government chokes the supply of those at will, making it unpredictable. If the sole goal of the H1B is to relieve temporary shortage of labor, H1Bs should not be allowed to apply for green cards.<p>In the end, I think we have arrived at the same conclusions: that we should increase our immigration quota for skilled immigrants and establish a system independent of the H1B visa for it. I don't know how you intend to test for cultural fit, but I am open to listening to ideas there.<p>I was dreading putting the bonded labor comparison there, which is why I added the caveat. But a bonded laborer cannot leave their job until their debts are paid off, and an H1B with a greencard application pending cannot leave their job until they get a greencard (or risk losing whatever life/assets the have built up here). I see similarities there, although, <i>obviously</i> the two are not identical.<p>It is easy to say that immigrants should not expect to build a life and live here permanently, just because they <i>can</i> apply for a green card. However, the current approach to immigration causes uncertainty which hurts both the country (because very skilled immigrants, given a choice, will not accept the uncertainty) and immigrants themselves (for obvious reasons).",1266884480

In a real interview, I would expect a good candidate to indicate that they would pull in a bignum library to avoid this, but there is no way to say that in this sort of test. Likewise, depending on the exact specifications, you might consider using a 64-bit integer type to hold the sum, but that's not portable yet. Presumably, if you're limited to standard C++ (which has no bignum library) and required to pass the overflow test to get a top score, the only way to do this is to reimplement the relevant parts of a bignum type. Of course, that is exactly the <i>wrong</i> thing to do if you have to solve this sort of problem in reality.<p>It is particularly unfortunate that they would criticise a candidate's code for this, while at the same time making a basic mistake themselves in the specification for the equi function. (If, as the problem states, there may be many elements in the input, then the correct return type for an index into a std::vector<int> would be a std::vector<int>::size_type, not an int. A size_type is always unsigned, so returning -1 in the event of finding no match is a bad idea.)",1266884270

However, are we really so sure that there will always be a human labor demand to effectively meet the human labor supply?<p>What <i>do</i> we do when there is an excess of human labor? Everyone here is opposed to make work for good reason. But a suggestion that solves the moral issue of what to do with an unemployed human who is not contributing due to a lack of labor demand has not been proposed in the general case. It is typically waved away by saying, ""There will be a new industry."" But can we really not imagine that this new industry will remain un-automated for long? What about the new industry that begins by being automated?<p>I am not opposed to automation in the slightest. I think that if we can automate every task in the world, that would be the best thing.

However, because automation reduces overhead, competition will result in lower prices. The end result is that increased profits are only temporary, ultimately the main result is merely cheaper goods. And cheaper goods mean increased amounts of discretionary income. That money ultimately goes elsewhere, creating new jobs that didn't exist before or causing growth for old jobs that used to be niche.<p>Yes, I can imagine a future where most of the menial and factory jobs are performed by robots.

Good design means things like alignment, relationships between elements, ratios between sizes etc. It doesn't mean 7px or 10px. What I'm saying is that you can design things very well without pixel-perfect precision and while Android's tools may be more manual (essentially a saner HTML without cross-browser crap), they are not out of reach of any HTML developer.<p>And yes, our apps are not identical: Android has a drawer, dilaogs, spinners, toasts, uses the back button etc. But at the end of the day, you'll find the same functional screens, presenting the same information and offering the same functionality.",1312776305

2858712,comment,2857214,2858274,5,0,snprbob86,,,"Caching is affected by the HTTP verbs. For example, GET responses are (sometimes) cacheable because the object may not change. POST responses are not cacheable because they are not contractually required to be idempotent.<p>Logging is more interesting. I don't necessarily mean printf style logging either. Think about audit trails. For example:<p>One way to do a password reset is to have:<p><pre><code>    /forgot_password/
      GET:
        1) Shows a form asking for your email address.
      POST:
        1) Generates a security token
        2) Sends an email with the token
        3) Shows ""Check your inbox!""

    /reset_password/?token=abc123
      GET:
        1) Verifies the security token
        2) Shows a form asking for your new password
      POST:
        1) Re-verifies the security token
        2) Sets the new password
        3) Expires the security token
</code></pre>
Now, in this case, you'll notice that the security token needs to be stored somewhere. Where do you put it?<p>Well, one easy thing to do would be to add a column to the `users` table called `password_reset_token`. But then, of course, you're gonna want to expire a token that's not used in a while, so you need a `password_reset_token_created_at`. And surely you'll want to know which IP address the request came from, in case you start seeing a pattern of abuse. And what if I request my password be reset twice because the first email takes a little long to show up? When the first email finally comes, will the token already be invalid?<p>An alternate approach would be to restructure the URLs in a CRUD style:<p><pre><code>    /password/
      GET:
        Same as GET /forgot_password/
      POST:
        Similar to POST /forgot_password/
        Store the reset request in a `passwords` table

    /password/:token/
      GET:
        Similar to GET /reset_password/
        Supports multiple active tokens
      POST:
        Similar to POST /reset_password/
        Fills the new password into the `passwords` table
</code></pre>
This re-imagines passwords as nouns. As a side effect, you get a complete log of whenever anyone changes their password or requests to reset it. Want to enforce password reuse policies? Do analysis of password lifetimes? Track down malicious abuse of your password reset system? Those things are now pretty easy with a schema like this:<p><pre><code>    user_id: Integer
    reset_token: String
    hash: String
    salt: String
    created_at: DateTime
    updated_at: DateTime
</code></pre>
Here, the reset token is blank if the user is setting their initial password or changing their current password using their old password.<p>The created_at timestamp is what it sounds like. The updated_at timestamp would match the created_at timestamp, except for when password reset requests are fulfilled, setting the hash and salt.<p>Checking a user's current password simply involves:<p><pre><code>    SELECT hash, salt
    FROM passwords
    WHERE user_id = ?
    AND hash IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY updated_at DESC
    LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

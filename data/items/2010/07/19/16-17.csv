Some new gaming of systems will begin.  The price of parking gets weighed against the cost of just driving the car in circles for the duration of the stay, and the defector strategies, like shifting the car between locations which have a ""cars can wait X minutes for free to do a pickup"" rule, need to be watched for.<p>A business model that might well feel the mixed bite of autonomous vehicles is roadside hotel/motels.  If you invest in an autonomous car with ""sleeper options"" (or rent a sleeper car, bed(s) on smart wheels), any town within about 8 hours drive becomes psychologically much closer to home, just a night's sleep away.  It becomes closer to absurd to ever stop at any hotel between you and your destination or to take such trips so that they use your waking time.  But then hotels at the destination can cater to the ""just want a safe parking area and a shower/bathroom in the morning"" crowd.  Opportunities here too for the car rental companies to provide end-to-end ""sleeper car solutions""; competition and/or cross-promotion between car rental companies and hotels/parking-and-bathrooms chains.<p>Towns geographically central between large farther-flung working cities could become hubs for meetings, think Voronoi diagram.  Or they can choose, instead, to cater to the weekend tourism crowds from those large cities.  Somewhere around Eureka California will become the easy weekend meet-up mecca for practically the whole west coast.",1279558184

No for a bit of less sensationalism, you need a good process, if you have that you can do it on paper tools just help you streamline your process. When creating a process the #1 rule is don't add steps to a workers routine for example forcing a developer to branch and merge their changes just to get their 1 line of code into the system.<p>Here is what we did, we looked at ever-ones job and tried to figure out a way that we could not add steps to their job, that broke their work-flow. We then identified tasks that while technical really only needed someone to administer the process.<p>A good example of this is taking everyone's defect tickets and merging them into a version branch. While branching and merging is a technical process the person that is most knowledgeable about what needs to go in and what needs to be deferred to the next release is the release manager. Good ones generally have better process administration background than technical chops.<p>So given that they are the best person to oversee this process we wrote scripts and built a simple UI that allowed them to do trivial merges. If there was a conflict the system created a conflict branch and then generated a ticket in the tickets system and assigned it to a developer.<p>All of this worked in the work-flow that the developers are used to in their day to day tasks. If you got a merge resolution ticket. That was your task, it was not a by-product of trying to get your change in, so the developer saw it as their objective to resolve the ticket not just something to try to plow through to get you change in.<p>As well, when a developer checked in a change it would go into a continuous integration build once deployed onto a server the system would generate assign tickets to QA testers automatically when approved it would auto merge into the release branch, generate tickets if there where any non-trivial merges and then generate a manifest for the release manager.<p>The point is, streamline your process, identify areas that you can automate to not create new disjointed work-flows for your workers and get a manager to mange the process. Then and only then can you truly identify tools that can be plugged in to help streamline that process.<p>And remember above all else, creating task that are not intuitive to the work flow of a worker will create and environment where people put in the least amount of effort to get it through the hoops to get back to doing what they do best. It also means training every new recruit on a disjointed work-flow that does not come naturally and enduring the associated errors that accompany it.<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention once you have a process defined the metrics for reporting become self generating from that process. For example our release manifest is consumed by our PM tools to update velocity, effort towards goal, milestones and general project tracking.<p>How we start a project is that we define requirements in a system. Those requirements get broken down into work tickets and they they get assigned to developers or administrators. As the tickets get worked they feed back into the project management system to update the overall progress.",1279556162

1529116,story,,,1,0,loewenskind,"Ask HN: (CL related) Are iterators actually a bad pattern after all?",,"Some time ago MJD had a blog spat with Ralph Johnson about the nature of patterns [1].  In his example he claimed that the iterator pattern was a sign of a weakness that some languages didn't have.  Then he went on to show an example of languages that actually did have this problem [2].<p>Now it is true that implementing a traversal method on the collection class itself is more powerful in most situations (e.g. Smalltalk: #do) but where I see a problem is e.g. Common Lisp's ""mapcar"" function.  It can map over an arbitrary number of collections.<p>So my question is; is the iterator pattern bad for implementing this scenario?  I looked at the SBCL source code and they seem to be doing exactly this (granted they use closures for iterating, but it doesn't look like the generator strategy to me).  I see in [3] they make the case for using generators instead of the iterator pattern but this doesn't look very easy to use on an arbitrary number of collections (in fact I'd like to see an implementation of it, as it's not immediately clear to me how it would be done).  Further, I don't see what is being bought here.  The function passed to map isn't protected from the collection being mutated by another thread anymore than an iterator would be.<p>I would certainly agree that Iterator is an inferior approach in most scenarios but for mapcar-like scenarios?  What do you think?<p>[1] http://blog.plover.com/prog/design-patterns.html<p>[2] He mentioned Perl as not needing this pattern and showed a foreach example.  But the fact of the matter is that foreach in Perl can only iterate the built in list type.  It wouldn't work on custom made collections.<p>[3] http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/Iterator.html",1279555949

Although I have learned a lot, I feel like I am not amazing at any one area of computer science.<p>I thought by this time in my life I would have fallen so dearly in love with some topic that picking a specialization would have come naturally . However, I am interested in so many things right now, it is hard to limit myself.

I wrote this is because I keep seeing technical cofounders getting the shortchanged on equity, and I want them to know should get more. And I want non-technical cofounders to know that they should expect to give the technical cofounder a larger % equity than they often expect (unless they've really got a lot to offer).<p>Here's a scenario I see a lot: a non-technical cofounder has just received their MBA, they have no startup or industry experience, they have no prototype, they want a ""code monkey"" like YuriNiyazov says in another comment to build their product for them, they offer them 5% equity with no salary. For some reason, I keep seeing developers take them up on their offer! Under this scenario, I'm saying a developer should get 50% of the company because the non-technical founder is probably ok (maybe not great) and hasn't contributed a lot to the business yet.",1279555213

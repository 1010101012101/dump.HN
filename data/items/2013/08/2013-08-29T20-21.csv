Considering that the core functionality you want is done in less than 500 LOC (<a href=""https://github.com/argusdusty/Ferret/blob/master/ferret.go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/argusdusty/Ferret/blob/master/ferret.go</a>) it seems a great way to go :) instead of depending on a large external library. OTOH you could have probably just as easily written it in another performant language. But since Go happens to be performant and is already used in other parts of your project things just turned out great for you.",1377809988

This reallocation happened mainly through movement across firms. Immigration increased mobility of natives across firms and across municipalities but it did not increase their probability of unemployment. We also observe a significant shift in the native labor force towards complex service industries in locations receiving more immigrants. Those mechanisms protected individual wages from immigrants competition and enhanced their wage outcomes.

I think that at any given time, even when research is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;better than now&quot;, you&#x27;re probably somewhere near that number, especially (as one of the commenters pointed out) a lot of people who do research in this country are from other countries.

Especially given the highly rhetoric tone of the speech, reading it to me would just be doing the whole thing a disservice. A good chunk of what makes that speech successful is his awesome use of rhetoric and repitition to get his point across. It&#x27;s a really dumbass comparison but IMO Chris Rock does the same thing, he&#x27;ll repeat a concept over and over to the audience in between doing jokes about the concept. I think these are two sides to the same coin, rhetoric goes a LONG way when convincing others that your words are truth in public.<p>We studied this speech in my high school, as well as speeches by FDR and John F. Kennedy (sidenote: why are all great public speakers referred to by the initials that make up their name? MLK, FDR, JFK, etc.). We studied the speech to learn more about rhetoric and how an orator can twist common words into powerful devices for convincing you to believe in their ideas.<p>Oh and by the way? <i></i>we read it too<i></i>. This was to emphasize how much more powerful the speech is when SPOKEN rather than read. It&#x27;s really not that fun to read, the sentences are so repetitive, short and simple that it&#x27;s hard to believe an educated man wrote them, but that is of course the purpose of such speeches...you speak them in such a way that the simple becomes complex and weak words become powerful.",1377809162

    <script>sjcl = ...</script>

And overwrite the library on the client side.<p>Ok, suppose the browser support for content-signing prevents this somehow.

I&#x27;m not totally familiar with the API sjcl exposes, but consider something like the e=1 RSA bug that was found recently.<p>Even if sjcl&#x27;s API is so great that it&#x27;s impossible to misuse, an attacker could simply render application code that doesn&#x27;t use it at all.

If registering federally as a money transmission business with FinCEN is really not so complicated, maybe many people will do it and follow AML/KYC laws.  I know it was not long in Bitcoin-OTC community before I found individual sellers requiring a mobile telephone number, and doing formal verification of that before they would do business.<p>At the time it was claimed (probably true) that it was necessary to go to this length so that PayPal would honor the transaction.  PayPal is notorious for charge-backs, and  with the Bitcoin seller having followed these procedures to verify e-mail address and phone number matching the primary on the Paypal account that was buying bitcoins, the person could claim and prove that they indeed sold something.  Without that verification, PayPal would almost universally reverse the transaction at the request of the buyer.<p>I haven&#x27;t bought or sold any bitcoins with PayPal in a while, I don&#x27;t know if people are still doing it or if it&#x27;s again considered a &quot;hot area.&quot;  Last time I heard anything, sellers stopped accepting MoneyPak because it&#x27;s usually 100% reversible without cause by the buyer.

Now, the level at which Woz was coding was not your standard Ruby scripting mombo jumbo, and hence it&#x27;s a world apart from what some folks consider coding, which is implicit in what he&#x27;s saying.<p>Also by Woz saying that &quot;(Steve) wasn&#x27;t an engineer,&quot; he was clearly stating the fact that Steve at that point in time was more about the business, the direction of things and the big picture rather than the nitty gritty stuff for which he had Woz to do it for him/them.<p>All in all, lets be honest, Steve forte was never ever his technical prowess.  I&#x27;m sure some business majors here, who get away with getting other folks do to stuff for them, truly believe they are very technical as well, even though they don&#x27;t know shit!<p>Steve definitely had a good eye at what could and couldn&#x27;t sell, particularly at the end of his career.  Now, what Steve was really good about was in getting very good technical folks in house and getting away in pushing them to the limit of exploitation, because after all it was Steve Jobs.  Hence, he was great at causing confusion and manipulation, which is why he was so good at marketing.<p>If Woz wouldn&#x27;t have been around, Apple simply wouldn&#x27;t have existed with Steve alone.

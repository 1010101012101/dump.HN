On FreeBSD with AHWM (instead of Ubuntu with GNOME), I don't have such issues at all.

It seems like his problem with X crashing was one of the GUI itself crashing, in its entirety, whereas Aero crashed when there was specifically a driver issue not directly related to Aero itself.<p>Aero is able to get around it by having a secondary ""legacy"" GUI system to back it up, and by having multiple drivers so a ""lesser"" driver can kick in.  X has lesser drivers available to it, but there's no backup GUI system to back it up.<p>Now, imagine that the fundamental interface between the kernel and the GUI actually crashed (sorry about the hand-wavy way I phrased that -- since Unix/Linux systems and MS Windows systems do it differently, I can't get more specific).  What would Unix with X do?  Well, it'd fall back to the command line.<p>What would MS Windows with Aero do?  It would fall back to whatever passes for a blue screen of death in the Windows 7 world, because MS Windows basically doesn't have an OS without the GUI.  The command line interface is part of the damned GUI in MS Windows.<p>I'm not saying X is perfect.  It does indeed need a lot of fixing.  I actually think we'd be better of replacing it from scratch, if we could get everyone on board.  I do not, however, think that MS Windows is the model to use.  In fact, I think that on a <i>good</i> day, MS Windows is only <i>nearly as good</i> as X.  In short, X and the MS Windows GUI stack both suck, but at least the way X works with the OS is marginally less stupid than the way MS Windows works with its GUI systems.",1250440081

766254,comment,766104,766168,0,0,marvin,,,"That is an unfounded claim. According to Nuclear War Survival Skills (a downloadable book on the construction of improvised fallout shelters), nuclear fallout remains <i>directly</i> lethal only for two weeks. This is the kind of fallout produced from a detonation where the fireball touches the earth. After this period, radiation from the fallout is weak enough that it is safe to move about for a limited time each day. A nuclear detonation in the air produces much less fallout, and it will be diluted over a much larger area unless there is precipation.<p>Any discussion beyond this is guesswork..as far as I know we have never really studied this stuff. It would be interesting if someone could point out that I'm wrong. The following article claims that the number of birth defects and cancer-related deaths from the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings are too small to be seen in the (admittedly sparse) data collected.<p>I think it's a good idea to study the traditional notion that nuclear war is so extremely destructive. The subject seems to be a voluntary intellectual wasteland - no one ever wants to find out how things <i>really</i> would work, only quote the canonical belief that any nuclear war would cause huge amounts of deaths from cancer, birth abnormalities, barren fields, genetic mutations and nuclear winter.<p>What such a war would do to <i>society</i> is an entirely different matter, but this is almost never discussed.",1250439875

Windows 7, which is indeed a great product - very polished and with a very advanced graphics stack, nevertheless has problems. I've been running it as a secondary OS for some things for a while, and it definitely exhibited problems, in particular with video playback. Media Player crashed, requiring me to reboot before I can play video again, the desktop manager crashed many times, making it impossible to do simple file operations without restarting and driver management was often very difficult and problematic. Idealizing W7 (or Vista, or OS X) does nothing to advance the state of Linux or computing in general.<p>2. Sure, it's absolutely fine for users to complain about low quality software, but if you want to make a difference and improve things (and presumably, if you bother to write an article about this, you do) the more effective way to do that is not to vent your anger and start a flame war, but actually deal with the real problems. Are Evolution, Totem, VLC or X.org buggy? Help identify the bugs and report them to the projects, so that they have a chance to fix them. When the fix is out, help testing it. You don't need to be a nerd or a geek or a dork or anything to do that - just a good citizen. It takes relatively little of your time, and you'll know you've actually done something to improve things, which will benefit you and the rest of the world in the future. That's not something you can do with W7 ot Vista, and that's where the power of the free software community lies.<p>Complaining is so easy, and can sometimes feel fun (in a very immature and destructive way), but if you're not prepared to do anything to improve the situation, don't expect it to improve itself.",1250439303

Is such thing efficient enough to be reasoned about when trying to calculate the overall killing power of all nuclear weapons?",1250438994

When the numbers are skewed, the resulting debate is skewed.<p>Along those lines, another well-quoted stat is infant mortality rate, which also drives down life expectancy. But in the U.S., premature babies are routinely saved much earlier than elsewhere in the world. This means that lots of premature babies are more often lost too -- thereby making the infant mortality rates look like something from a third-world country.<p>You can't manage something unless you measure it, but you can't measure it unless you define it. I'm perfectly happy with a very high infant death-rate and a slightly lower life expectancy rate now that I understand the definitions. But a common understanding is a key component of discussion.<p>So now every time somebody trots out those same old tired stats we have to have the same conversation over and over again. It's like the old myth that paying money for prevention saves money in the long run -- lots of stats sound reasonable and seem to make a simple point but don't mean what people think they mean.<p>That's not a good situation.",1250438499

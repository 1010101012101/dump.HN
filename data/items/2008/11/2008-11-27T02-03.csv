They haven't abandoned their standard product line, in fact they just released the Bold which may be the best of that paradigm.<p>They released the Storm to cater to the 75% of Americans who don't want to be on AT&T for whatever reason. When the iPhone was released, everyone said ""Apple is going to make it about the device, not the carrier"" but the reality is they haven't. A lot of people haven't purchased one simply because they prefer another carrier.<p>Blackberry is giving them an alternative with the Storm. I don't know if it's a good one (maybe not) but it's probably the best, and will probably sell decently just for that.",1227754611

Let me give you a trivial example: drinking water that wouldn't kill you.  The history of humanity up until quite recently was the history of drinking water.<p>However, most areas of major Western nations hit, effectively, the Drinking Water Singularity a long time ago: you can get what are (relative to historical needs and prices) infinite amounts for nothing.  (Seriously: think of how much human labor it costs to draw one bucket of water from the well located several miles from your village.  Mentally got an idea for how much?  OK, now how much labor does it take a McDonalds employee to afford one bucket worth of tap water?  What, maybe a quarter of a second, if that?)<p>The change from cholera outbreaks to no cholera  outbreaks, which happened way the heck back on that curve, had PROFOUND consequences for civilization.  The change from ""I could fill up a swimming pool for a trivial amount of money"" to ""I could fill up TEN swimming pools for a trivial amount of money"" had negligible consequences for civilization.  All that water wealth, nothing of major consequence to spend it on.<p>(I know, I'm overlooking the fact that certain areas like the American Southwest are actually facing water crunchiness again, and large portions of the human population still fail to have their basic needs met.  Ignore that for the purpose of simplification -- and incidentally, ""You can have all the water you can drink but you can't water your lawn in the daytime""  is still singularity-esque relative to ""Send a woman to walk a mile to bring back a bucket of water"".)<p>That is how I see the technology singularity coming about: what if I gave you all the CPU cycles you could want for nothing and you found, after a certain point, you had nothing of major consequence to spend them on?  What are you going to do, calculate a new Mersenne Prime every second for eternity and call it the singularity?<p>[Edit: I originally said typhus, not cholera.  Typhus is not caused by water quality issues.  Sorry, it has been a long time since I played Oregon Trail.]",1227754422

SSL, a protocol that is far, far easier to deploy and manage than DNSSEC, sees transient errors so often that users are rebelling against the size of the error messages Firefox generates for them.

He shows that each <i>individual</i> computing technology follows an S curve, but the exponential price-performance of computation continues through a smooth transition to the next method.  For example, as vacuum tube computing saturated, transistor computing picked up.  This is not a coincidence; as one technology reaches saturation, resources flow to the bottleneck, fostering the next technique in the chain.<p>Intel hit just such a wall a few years ago with the size of its gates.  Many had predicted, based on this bottleneck, that Moore's Law might end some time around 2003-2005.  Intel's CTO Justin Rattner explained at this year's Singularity Summit that there are smart people at Intel, and they found a way around the problem.  In fact, the transition was so smooth that few people even noticed.<p>And so it goes.  The computational capacity of matter is effectively infinite on the scale of current technology, so there's no reason to expect computation to saturate for a <i>long</i> time.  Barring a global cataclysm, it's hard to see anything standing in the way of a technological singularity some time in the next 50-100 years.",1227751623

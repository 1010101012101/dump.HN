You seem to be reasoning from an n of 3 or 4 people.<p>I find it easy to see why Apple expects it to be popular. I may be wrong, but the (apparent) fact that lots of people are interested in buying an iPad suggests they can think of ways to use it, and seriously doubt that Apple would be investing lots of money in launching one without assuring themselves of likely demand first.<p>Me, I would rather not buy an iPad - even though it looks like a very good product, technically - because I am increasingly put off by Apple's aggressive vertical integration and business tactics (like this patent lawsuit). But however I feel about that, I can't deny their expertise in engineering and marketing. Even if I buy a competitor's product, the price and specifications will have been influenced by Apple's offering.<p>I feel like we (computer users) have already gone through this 'utility' barrier many times - did average consumers 'need' the mouse, the GUI, videogame consoles, color graphics, dedicated monitors (vs a TV adapter) etc.. etc.? Well, no, not as such, but it seems that people's desire for a technology often forms prior to the availability of tools that properly exploit it, even though their use cases may be inchoate.<p>I'll give you two examples of non-computer geeks who nevertheless have use cases for a tablet, with the understanding that these too are anecdotal.<p>One is down the street from me: the people who work at the 7-11 use an oldish Panasonic tablet computer for inventory management. they probably don't need multitouch and the software looks a bit primitive, but they seem well comfortable treating it as a digital clipboard that they can hold with one hand and operate with the other. Now, you don't need a degree to work at 7-11 or even to get your own store, just a willingness to work at a small 24-hour retail outlet. 7-11 is a mature franchise business so I don't imagine that they rolled out the use of tablets to their employees on a whim - more likely, such devices hit a sweet spot between usability and capability which proved beneficial for limiting the cost of inventory control.<p>Another area is for creatives in a studio. I work with audio and video for a living, and for some tasks using a mouse is royal pain in the ass. There is a thriving industry in hardware control surfaces for musicians, and many of them are repurposed by 3d animators, compositors, and other video professionals because the cost of dedicated hardware for the latter is stratospheric. A general purpose device with multitouch is already a winner in this market. Cheaper ones will sell like hotcakes.<p>Add enough of these market segments together, and you're looking at some real money.",1267570500

1162789,comment,1162371,1162698,0,0,jrheard,,,"That's a great blog - it's really interesting to see what the code-o-sphere looks like to a newcomer!<p>I saw that you were having a little trouble dealing with some of the proper-noun Concepts thrown at you in Beginning Ruby, and that you weren't entirely sure where to go next in terms of finding exercises not already in the book.<p>As far as the Concepts go, it's probably best to approach them all as a bunch of different ways of solving the <i>one main problem in programming</i>: complexity[1]. When you're coding anything longer than ten lines, you're usually tackling a problem that's too big to fit into your head all at once. So, you need to break the problem into a bunch of little chunks. Coders do this by building <i>abstractions</i>.<p>All an abstraction is is the act of deciding you've got a problem (""I need a way to print the contents of the screen!""), solving that problem (by writing code that grabs whatever's being output to the screen, translates it into something the printer can deal with, and prints it), and then <i>hiding that solution from anyone who has that problem</i>. The key here is that you're hiding the solution, but you do expose an interface - a ""print_document"" function, say - that allows them to benefit from your hard work without having to think about it[2].<p>That's really what nearly every programming technique is all about: minimizing complexity. So when you see big scary words like Encapsulation and Polymorphism and Mix-Ins, just remember: they're almost certainly just different ways of minimizing the amount of stuff you have to think about at any point in time, and if they're any good at letting you do that, they're probably worth learning about.<p>Oh! And as far as finding fun exercises to work on goes: Try writing something that'll automate a chore in your daily life. Say, an automated grocery list, or a ""books to read"" list, or an apocalypse-detector that checks every five minutes to see if Google's down. You know what they say about the sky and the limit and all that :)<p>-<p>[1] “Managing complexity is the most important technical topic in software development.  In my view, it’s so important that Software’s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity"" - Steve McConnell, Code Complete<p>[2] ""Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them"" - Alfred North Whitehead",1267570257

I'm not convinced.<p>In your scenario, the 500 comments are already loaded for any user. The comments you have authored are a small dataset, not a check for each and every comment. (At least, I HOPE not.) Similarly for your friends comments... and whether or not you are a mod is a single check.<p>For the average thread and user, this really should be a handful of checks. Surely, there are some very active users with many friends for whom the checks could hit numbers in the 1000s. But that should be the edge case, shouldn't it?<p>Same thing for loading a listing. Pulling subscriptions and merging sounds like just DB query design. All the ""same things as we do for comments"" should be minimized as described above.<p>Rending a page is just that -- rendering... highly customized, yes.

1) What percentage of users are logged in?
2) What percentage of page renders really fit the scenario you described above, with enough comments and related data points that the checks hit 4 digits?<p>If you come back and say 90% of your page renders needs 1000 data points, I'd certainly concede the point.

The factors that effect body weight are also vastly different, I'm sorry but we've got thousands of medicines that weren't available 50 years ago, and one of the major contributing factors to weight loss is disease.<p>Americas weight problem isn't going to be resolved by figures and statistics, and it's certainly going to be hurt by poor statistics like those provided in the study in question.<p>How can a 190lb average American Joe consume 3800 calories working an Average sedentary job not be gaining a pound of body fat per week?

I'll just suggest a few different ways of thinking about what you wrote above.<p>1. Publishers don't care about your posting rhythm or how many Twitter clickthrough rates. In fact, many don't even care about your book topic.<p>They care about your platform and how well other books in this vein have done.<p>I noticed that you yourself indicated that there are few books on failure, while many books on success. Why do you think that is? What would make your book different?<p>2. A series of musings is usually a very bad book. Who is the market? Do you already have a presence there? For example, publishers started approaching me once they noticed that iwillteachyoutoberich.com was popping up in the personal-finance space.<p>3. On a tactical note, typically authors find an agent, who then finds the publishers. If you really want to publish a book, go find agents who have written books similar to yours and send them a pitch letter.<p>4. Also on a tactical note, driving 20k uniques in 2 months is very good. However, from looking at your site, you haven't captured those people. In other words, they came once and left, never to return. Think carefully about how to capture these people so you can continue sending them material that they want, love, and expect.<p>I can get into outbound marketing if people care, but suffice it to say that many, many startups overvalue social media and ignore channels that actually convert. Hint: Twitter. (Test it and see for yourself.)<p>4. MOST IMPORTANT. What is your goal? You indicated you don't care about the ego boost of being an author. So carefully consider whether a book is really what you want to do. There are many, many other channels (ebook, blog, etc) that don't require the back-breaking work of writing a book. Mine took 2 years to complete. A book is specifically useful for building your brand and spreading your ideas. But in most cases, there are other channels that work better.<p>(Incidentally, we should come up with a name for areas where people who work tell others NOT to do it. Examples: Authors, musicians, lawyers...)<p>Hope that helps. Let me know if you have other questions.",1267568263

I wanted somewhere that felt more close-knit, and where interesting discussion could be had around those things. For me, Forrst is that place (and I'm hoping others will agree). I don't think you necessarily need to be a designer-developer combo; designers with an interest in development (who may or may not write code, too), and developers who appreciate (or create) design, both could potentially find a good fit on Forrst.<p>One of the biggest goals I have for Forrst is to help people connect and engage with like-minded peers.<p>Am I far off in inferring you see Forrst as a place where you could potentially meet a designer or developer to collaborate with?

I also wonder whether trading links, code snippets, and images can produce the same kind of trust as that produced by working side-by-side on an actual project. That said, this may not be the goal.<p>Agreed, not 100% of the content posted on Forrst will be relevant to 100% of its users. There are some things in the works that should help to address the filtering problem -- being able to find things that are highly relevant to you is something I hope Forrst help with.

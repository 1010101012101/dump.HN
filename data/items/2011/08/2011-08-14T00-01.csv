Whether you volunteer versus donate money versus raise awareness is your own choice, but that choice has consequences. If a high-powered lawyer who makes $1,000 an hour chooses to take an hour off to help clean up litter on the beach, he's wasted the opportunity to work overtime that day, make $1,000, donate to a charity that will hire a hundred poor people for $10/hour to clean up litter, and end up with a hundred times more litter removed. If he went to the beach because he wanted the sunlight and the fresh air and the warm feeling of personally contributing to something, that's fine. If he actually wanted to help people by beautifying the beach, he's chosen an objectively wrong way to go about it. And if he wanted to help people, period, he's chosen a very wrong way to go about it, since that $1,000 could save two people from malaria.

Let me explain:<p>I thought it's worth sharing this site for a couple of reasons. Mainly, because it's an online company which has done everything right (as far as I can see). Their items are displayed in a great way, they're clear about every detail, they update the price on every step (instead of surprising you at the end), they show every detail separately and allow you to read about it even more (fabric weights, characteristics, colours used, ...) They are fun to use (subjective, I know). They have great presence on the internet - couldn't find a single bad opinion about them, people are happy to show off pictures of their products on flickr, twitter, facebook - they say how excited they are about the products.<p>Their website is helpful in every possible way: for people new to tailored clothes it's got simple explanations on every step; for people caring about environment/world, it's got information about the manufacturing place, organic fabrics, short paragraph about work conditions; all newsletters are opt-in; all scripts are there because they're helpful (for example they'll tell you if your measured size doesn't fit in the expected range and let you ignore or correct it) - no silly stuff. They pretty much nailed it in every way I can think of. And on top of that they can really compete with prices - I can't find any local service in a similar price range. When they don't offer something, they say it without trying to hide the fact (for example they explain why they don't do phone contact and what is their policy instead). What they do offer is still pretty unique (completely custom clothes). They even try to upsell in a nice way, if you buy a shirt, it seems that other items / accessories start appearing on the front page instead.<p>Even though I just came back from shopping, I ordered a shirt from them (an hour after seeing the page for the first time) and couldn't be more excited about it, even though I normally hate shopping for clothes. I hope that people who try to sell anything on the internet will see this example and learn something from them.",1313282850

If you want to have a variable or instance attribute or argument to a function or method, its type must be declared in terms of an interface, not a particular implementation.  This way, you never get yourself into the situation where you say, ""I don't want to inherit from Foo, I want to implement its interface myself"" but can't.<p>Beyond that, there is only so much a language can do to help you.  It's nice to have guaranteed privacy, but if you use it like the Java standard library does, it becomes the worst language feature ever.

Even in this environment, we need to give everyone a math test as part of the hiring process.  We can't trust the GPA.  Top software firms make developers write code as part of the interview.  Even CS (which seems tougher than most majors) suffers from grade inflation.  The beauty of this system is that ""grade grubbers"" who nag the professors for better grades ultimately don't get rewarded.  People who are in school to learn do.<p>A prior firm that I worked for (large consultancy) did a study on if GPA was predictive of good work performance.  They found that there was a pass/fail barrier of a 3.0 for technical degrees, and 3.2 for non-technical degrees.  Folks who couldn't find a way to hit the lower barrier on average didn't do as well.  Folks who did better were more likely - but there was no benefit for getting much higher.  A 3.8 student wasn't any more likely to perform better than a 3.1 student.  (Slightly off-topic - the only other predictor of success was people who worked at least part-time while in school.  It didn't matter what the job was, but people who had to work doing school on average performed better than those who didn't.)<p>So what can be done that doesn't crush the professors?

2882387,comment,2881221,2881221,2,0,Jach,,,"Hey, this is actually a more serious article than I thought. (I thought it was going to be about defending the sequel-after-sequel business model.)<p>This page has a decent section on violent games that I snipped below: <a href=""http://www.theodoregray.com/BrainRot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theodoregray.com/BrainRot/</a> (I mostly use it as a link in the argument over letting students use calculators in Calculus and above.) I thought the following section was pretty interesting. On the one hand it seems that violent games can condition a person to react more violently in certain circumstances, but on the other hand the existence of violent media seems to decrease the number of those circumstances (depending on which data you look at anyway, the freakonomics post linked here is certainly intriguing, and a decrease in crime is probably more strongly linked with an increase in median standard of living).<p>====<p><i></i>Theo<i></i>: Let's start with something I'm sure most people would agree has little educational value, the video game.  We'll discuss later how video games are related to educational software.<p>To understand the effects of video games, one needs to go back to debriefings conducted by the U.S. Army after WWII.  Interviewing soldiers returning from battle, researchers discovered a very disturbing fact.  A significant number of soldiers had been face to face with an enemy soldier, rifle in hand, enemy in their sights, gun not jammed, and had <i>not fired</i> .  Something deep in their being, some sort of innate humanity, had prevented them from actually pulling the trigger.<p>Needless to say, this was very disturbing to the military.  They began a research effort to figure out what to do about this problem.  They discovered that in the heat of battle, under the incredible physical and psychological stress of being faced with another human being you were supposed to kill, the higher mental functions were largely absent.  Under such conditions, the mind reverts to much simpler modes of operation, to deeply wired, almost instinctive behaviors.  In other words, no amount of target practice at bullseye targets and classroom lectures about how you're supposed to kill the enemy had much effect when it counted.<p>Over the following decades and wars, the Army learned that the way to get soldiers to reliably pull the trigger was to use very basic, repetitive operant conditioning, along the lines of standard behaviorist theory.  Now, behaviorism provides a very poor model for how humans act in everyday life, but it turns out to be a pretty good model for how humans act when they are under stress and have to act quickly, and are responding primarily to fear.  Under stress, fearful people do what they have been conditioned to do.<p>The Army's solution was to replace dry target practice with realistic training grounds, complete with pop-up targets, loud noises, smoke, stress, the works.  The goal was to condition the soldiers: If it moves, shoot it <i>now</i>, don't think about it.  Repetition, repetition, repetition: Target pops up, you shoot.  Target pops up, you shoot.  Do that often enough, and, research shows, next time you see something pop up, you are more likely to shoot it, even if it's a real human in a real battle.  This is not just a theory, it is documented by exit interviews from soldiers in later wars: The Army got what it wanted.  (What armies do, and how that is similar to video games, is forcefully presented in the book <i>On Killing</i> by David Grossman, a former military officer (Little Brown, 1995)).<p>Now, what does this have to do with video games?  The answer should be obvious by now to anyone who's ever seen one.  The whole point is, if it moves, shoot it.  Again and again and again.<p><i></i>Jerry<i></i>: Well yes, but it's aliens and other fantasy figures they are shooting at, not people.  Does it really carry over?<p><i></i>Theo<i></i>: Yes it does.  (And by the way, it's not all aliens; many video games have photo-realistic people complete with recognizable human faces, and blood splatters.  You stick your handgun in their face at point blank range and pull the trigger.)  Intellectually, no one would confuse a video game with real life, but we're not talking about an intellectual situation.  We're talking about a scared kid with a Saturday night special in his hand seeing a member of a rival gang move his hand around in his coat.  That kid is thinking at an operant conditioning level; what matters more than anything else is how many times in the past he has pulled the trigger.  In reality or in a video game, it doesn't make that much difference.  For a good discussion of the current consensus opinion on the effects of violence on TV and in movies and video games, see the book <i>Mayhem</i> by Sissela Bok (Perseus Books, 1998).<p>If you think watching violent TV is bad, video games are much, much worse.  TV is a passive medium, requiring no participation from the viewer.  A kid watching a murder on TV may not be benefiting much from it, and maybe he's learning a certain degree of callousness, but at least he is not being conditioned to pull the trigger.  He is just watching.  In the video game, he is the murderer, <i>he pulls</i> the trigger, <i>he participates</i> in the violence.<p>When soldiers are trained to kill, it is with a certain amount of context, with an effort to teach honor, duty, self restraint, and the difference between civilian and military life.  When a 12-year-old kid comes out of his bedroom after spending three hours actively participating in the killing of people, what context has he had? what debriefing does he get?<p>I should mention that most of this chapter was written before the recent outbreak of kids shooting their classmates at school.  To what degree video games contributed to those incidence is of course subject to endless debate, but the public does seem to have been alerted to the topic.

Someone posted a Ask HN thread asking something along the lines of ""Does your startup help change the world?""<p>I couldn't believe some of the responses. There were tons of people saying that their iPhone apps were because they made it easier to find restaurants.. or that their B2B social media marketing startup was because it was improving productivity for marketers. I'm paraphrasing but that was the gist of many of the responses. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing but respect for people who have successful typical startups. But that said, I think people sometimes are extremely sheltered if they think that those sorts of problems are really impacting lives.<p>Families who never thought it would happen to them across the United States are finding themselves homeless. My wife is from a small town that just 15 years ago had very high employment. Today the town is rapidly turning into a miniature Detroit after the main employer of the town closed down and moved overseas. Countless numbers of children are going hungry this summer since their primary and often times only nutritious and filling daily meal is their school lunch. My city recently had a free health treatment clinic for one day only. Hundreds of people stood in line for hours and hours, only to be sent home since not all were able to be seen.<p>And yet, that's just in the United States. Elsewhere in the world, one BILLION people don't have access to clean drinking water. Hundreds of millions of people work 12 hour days seven days a week for in exchange for pennies. People are killed or imprisoned every day just for speaking out against their governments.<p>I'm not delusional or hopelessly optimistic. I'm aware that these are all major global problems, and they're far more complicated than any one person could ever hope to solve. But what I am interested in is finding out a way that I could be doing something as a career to be a part of this. I don't necessarily think that you have to be a nonprofit or charity to still contribute to these sort of things. SwipeGood and Sparked are two examples of this.<p>But my question is - has anyone actually built or is working on something related to these sorts of issues? I'm fascinated by stories such as the one behind Charity Water (http://www.charitywater.org/about/scotts_story.php) and reading about organizations like FreeGeek. I'd love to start a nonprofit of my own, but I have no clue where to begin. If anyone has any advice, thoughts, or would like to connect I'd love to hear from you.",1313280706

I think the lack of those systems make it easy to abandon the service for something else.<p>Having 100+ ""friends"" on Facebook isn't a compelling reason to stay when most people probably wouldn't notice if 90% of those individuals disappeared from one day to the next.  Most of your social network online is an illusion.<p>I'm testing out Google+ right now, but I'm doing so under an alias.

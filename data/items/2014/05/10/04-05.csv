A sort function in Haskell has type:<p><pre><code>    Ord a => [a] -> [a]\n</code></pre>\nYou therefore know that the implementation of the function can only make use of functions provided by Ord, and manipulation of the list structure. The function cannot inspect the values in the list except via comparison. This is an incredibly powerful guarantee. It&#x27;s also really useful when you go to implement the function because this level of parametricity guarantees that there are only so many valid implementations and only a couple of them are even close to correct.",1399697612

If you just gut feel it, well, I mean, that&#x27;s one way to go about it, sure, and if you are far enough from the line, that&#x27;s okay.   But if you are pushing the line, as pg advocates?   Gut feeling it is probably a bad idea.<p>For example, more than once, I&#x27;ve almost gone out of business.   Many years ago I hit serious financial issues.  I told all my VPS customers, and went through a lot of effort to find my co-lo customers a new home.<p>This was absolutely the right thing to do for my customers, but it also destroyed the company, when I could have made it<p>(I ended up re-launching the company very shortly thereafter, using money from my contracting gigs.  In fact, I think I had a few customers stick with me the whole time.)<p>Now, if I had shareholders at the time, I mean, who were not me?  From the perspective of the shareholders, I was not acting in their interest.  I should have concealed the possibly impending shutdown, and just worked hard to prevent the impending shutdown from occurring.   I am   pretty sure that if there was money on the line and there were owners who weren&#x27;t me, I would have gotten sued for acting in what I think was the most ethical manner.<p>Do you see what I&#x27;m getting at?  If we remove the ridiculous cases of stuffing cash into your underpants and running, a reasonable person can argue both sides of most business ethics questions. Your gut can argue both sides, too.",1399694806

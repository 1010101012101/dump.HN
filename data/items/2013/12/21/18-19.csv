6947521,comment,6945804,6946465,1,0,omegant,,,"That kind of attitude is awesome. But you will agree with me that it&#x27;s not the normal behaviour on most people. Most people will understand a well intended correction as a personal attack.for example that&#x27;s what happening with active atheism. When religious people are told that all their believes are wrong they take it as if you were attacking all the parts of their personality and not as an accurate description of the situation. In that moment they close their possition and react having even a stronger faith than before.\nI think that active atheist should begin to use the scientific method to check their approach on the matter (they are currently using the same evangelization method they critizice). If it&#x27;s not working the actual method new ones should be used. But this methods takes more time, as you must gain the trust of the person that you are trying to teach, and make them learn bit by bit without cuestioning their actual believes, only adding small gems of new knowleadge till they replace the old ones over time. The person doing this will probably will have to go to church with the rest of his community and take part on all the events with them religious or not.",1387652041

Quite a few Indians have been arrested on similar charges in the past without serious uproar, it&#x27;s the fact that a consular official was treated this way.  The US tends to be rather lax in its definition of &quot;diplomatic immunity&quot; when it comes to their benefit (see Raymond Davis) so such strictness is very hypocritical.

These 49 Russians now figure in a criminal complaint unsealed in the same Manhattan court, where India’s acting consul general was produced for a $250,000 bail hearing last week. Of these, 11 Russian diplomats continue to work at the Russian consulate in New York or at Moscow’s permanent mission to the United Nations in the Turtle Bay area of Manhattan.</i><p><i>So when Preet Bharara, the attorney for the Southern District of New York, unsealed the criminal complaint against the Russians in court in his usual flashy style, reporters who cover Bharara expected at least a few of the 11 Russians still within the reach of New York’s law enforcement to be paraded before them: it would have been a precursor to Khobragade’s arrest and subsequent bail. But nothing of that sort happened. Instead, when Bharara’s men set out in quest of the alleged offenders, with handcuffs in their pockets, they were promptly restrained by the US state department, according to authoritative sources who spoke to this writer. The state department told Bharara’s office that all the 11 serving Russian diplomats on US soil had diplomatic immunity and could not be arrested.</i>[1]<p>This entire Khobragade incident reeks of political grandstanding.

If I could use a bad analogy I&#x27;d compare the two world, setting up servers and engineering software to selling marble and being a sculpture.<p>Part of what drives those of us who write code is that we use that code as a creative outlet.  I&#x27;ll generally extend that to the process of designing products, be it hardware or software.  Mechanical design isn&#x27;t about setting up the CNC machine but rather about the creativity and the designer&#x27;s expression of interesting ideas.  I&#x27;ve walked away from designing sheet metal parts with a huge sense of, yes, artistic and creative accomplishment. Designing something that is beautiful and well done in your eyes are the highs that drive some of us.  Software or electrical engineering have similar embodiments of the same concept.<p>I can do Linux at a reasonable level and know most of the tools you listed, some superficially and others reasonably well.  However, setting up servers isn&#x27;t something that appeals to me as an occupation.  At some level it would be dishonest to go work for someone knowing that I would not bring a degree of passion to the job.  As an entrepreneur I would feel cheated if an employee took a job with me just to get by and not to knock it out of the park.  There&#x27;s a huge difference between a business where everyone is really engaged and one where nearly everyone thinks &quot;it&#x27;s just a job&quot;.  Perhaps the canonical example of this is the contrast between a rocking startup and a large, stratified and somewhat stagnant company with tens of thousands of employees.  There&#x27;s a huge difference between what both of those can accomplish given the same time and resources.<p>I am not diminishing what you do.  You seem to be passionate about supporting servers and that&#x27;s fantastic.  Those of us who prefer to create software products need people who can provide us with solid systems on which our software can run reliably and efficiently.<p>A long way of saying: It&#x27;s not for me.",1387650847

When we do that, we find that 1Password matches or exceeds the &quot;far more secure&quot; built-in form fillers.<p>If we ignore the title and some odd generalizations, this paper actually spells out how well 1Password avoids various risks when you look at the details.<p>Readers need to go through section 2 of the paper carefully to see which studied systems do what. The most worrisome of the kinds of flaws that browser-based password managers face (filling things for <a href=\"https://foo.example\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://foo.example</a> into <a href=\"http://foo.example\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://foo.example</a> and filling for bar.example origin forms on foo.example pages) are things that 1Password handles correctly.<p>The things that we don&#x27;t do &quot;right&quot; in their eyes are things that their recommended alternative (built-in browser form fillers) also don&#x27;t do &quot;right&quot;.  I&#x27;m not sure that the authors have fully thought through would it would even mean to do those &quot;right&quot;. But I encourage people to read the paper and decide for themselves whether we&#x27;ve made the correct choices in our handling of subdomains, and whether filling should be tied to a specific page on a site.<p>What of course does need to be considered are the risks of not using something in the browser. If you are copying and pasting from your password manager to your browser you are far more likely to be tricked by phishing, or cross origin forms than you would be with 1Password.<p>1Password tries to make it hard for you to fill in your credentials in the wrong place (you have to use copy/paste to manually do it where 1Password refuses to do it automatically), and to the extent that the concerns in the paper are legitimate, there are cases where browser-based fillers may fail to &quot;make it hard&quot; where the should.<p>Contrast that with the alternative of using copy/paste. Copy/paste offers no protections whatsoever against you filling in credentials to the wrong web form.<p>It would be foolish to claim that 1Password&#x27;s phishing prevention mechanisms can&#x27;t ever been defeated.

6947348,comment,6947081,6947081,55,0,bane,,,"> Last week, I watched with bewilderment as India’s most vociferous talk show host, Arnab Goswami, repeatedly asked his guests if they expected an Indian diplomat who is paid $4,180 a month to pay her domestic servant $4,500 a month. Meanwhile an American guest, Lisa Curtis, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, tried to make a point: “If somebody cannot afford to have domestic help, then they don’t have domestic help.”<p>I had a few Indian friends in college who all lamented the lack of servants in their American day-to-day. One woman I knew recalled having 6 or 7 servants, but described herself as coming from just a normal, slightly-upper-middle class family.<p>It really stuck with me over the years. Growing up in the U.S., servants have a kind of old-world upper-class, if not crusty and exploitive, vibe.<p>Yet I&#x27;ve found myself over the years, as free-time disappeared into work and salaries increased, hiring a maid to come in once a month to clean house and a gardener to mow my lawn and tidy my plants once every couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve hired tutors and other private instructors, a fixit guy who comes and does other maintenance on my home every once in a while and so on. My wife and I have toyed with having a cook come in once a week and prepare a bunch of meals.<p>I&#x27;m sure if pressed I could come up with a half dozen other people I&#x27;ve hired on for their physical labor at one time or another. If needed, I&#x27;m sure most of them would become &quot;live in servants&quot; for the right price and accommodations.<p>It&#x27;s also not uncommon in my area for families to hire Au Pairs which is really just a fancy way of saying live-in Nanny/house maid, which is a servant&#x27;s title. They&#x27;re given fairly little pay, maybe $1200/mo and room and board in exchange for child care and some house chores/personal assistant work. In other areas dedicated personal assistants are quite common. And I&#x27;ve seen people setup &quot;internships&quot; for their personal businesses which are so tied to their personal lives that the work is usually just personal assisting for intern pay.<p>Yet in the U.S. we&#x27;ve allergic to calling these people &quot;servants&quot; because it seems menial and disparaging I guess.<p>I&#x27;m curious though, where does the concept of &quot;servant&quot; actually end? Is my mechanic a servant? Or is he not because I go to his place for him to do the work instead of having him come to mine?",1387649309

I worked with .net since the 1.0 days and after years of staunch support, I got a job last year working with python/javascript on a unix stack and kissed microsoft technologies goodbye.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right about Microsoft being behind the curve. There&#x27;s a pattern of denial when it comes to new technologies, and a total ineptitude at spotting new trends and adapting to them. I watched with envy for years as all the rails kids played with their new toys until Microsoft got its shit together and came up with an MVC solution.<p>The whole world is using flash? Lets come up with a knock-off 5 years too late. Interactivity is a big deal? Let&#x27;s try to convince them that webforms is MVC until its too late. Who needs javascript anyways? Distrubuted software you say? Let&#x27;s not jump on the REST bandwagon, lets make WSDL defined web services and make a shitty API on top! Why have an ORM solution when putting all of your business logic in SQL is SO EASY with microsoft? See, I can drag and drop a database connection from Visual Studio!<p>I love C# as much as the next person. It&#x27;s a great language. SQL Server is a pretty good relational database. But if you choose to devote all of your energy to Microsoft development and don&#x27;t learn anything else, you have nobody to blame expect for yourself when you find your skill-set behind the curve.<p>.Net developers would never agree about the big-data part, because to be honest they haven&#x27;t invested time into understanding what data science is. There are so many IT shops developing on the Microsoft stack that make less than say 50 million a year that have tons of data (billions of records they say!). Maybe they make CRM software, or school software, or an inventory system for a small grocery store. They have tons of test scores, purchase records, waste numbers, demographic info, yet if you ask them to develop something that gives you insight into what factors influence student performance, or to visualize perchasing trends, or to predict sales numbers so that the company doesn&#x27;t over purchase perishables, you&#x27;ll get a blank stare. The idea that data can be transformed into useful information, and that this isn&#x27;t simply a matter of CRUD hasn&#x27;t occurred to them. They probably don&#x27;t even replicate their db for their half ass attempt at reporting, so they wouldn&#x27;t begin to understand what something like hadoop even does.<p>You simply CANNOT explain to a .net zealot what big data is. They just don&#x27;t get it. &quot;It&#x27;s stored in the database, and its a few terabytes...how big does it need to get? We aren&#x27;t Google afterall!&quot;",1387649161

San Francisco is now looking at a number of fail whales, but, at the same time, housing regulations prevent them from scaling.  They&#x27;ve made that as a deliberate choice, and a pretty baffling one.<p>As I stated elsewhere (so won&#x27;t bother repeating at length), I believe the market would ultimately correct for this except for the artificially constrained supply being imposed by the building regulations.

TokyoCabinet has great performance usually.  I haven't done a careful head-to-head comparison, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was somewhat faster than leveldb for many workloads.  Plus TokyoCabinet is more mature, has matching server code etc. and may therefore be a better fit for many projects.<p>However because of a fundamental difference in data structures (TokyoCabinet uses btrees for ordered storage; leveldb uses log structured merge trees), random write performance (which is important for our needs) is significantly better in leveldb.  This part we did measure.  IIRC, we could fill TokyoCabinet with a million 100-byte writes in less than two seconds if writing sequentially, but the time ballooned to ~2000 seconds if we wrote randomly.  The corresponding slowdown for leveldb is from ~1.5 seconds (sequential) to ~2.5 seconds (random).",1304876852

There are plenty of authors who are now considered iconic, who had very rough starts and only realized their potential because someone in the publishing industry spent a lot of time and money helping them develop.</i><p>I'm not arguing for what is the ideal system. I'm arguing the position that market dynamics are such that publishing houses will lose to self-publishing. The casualty of that may very well be authors that can't make it without a lot of mentoring. I'm not saying that publishing houses don't and can't have good impact on the creation of good writing. I'm saying that their contribution won't be enough to justify their cost and they will be put out of business.<p>> <i>so I'm really not all that concerned that ""unleashing experienced editors on new authors probably reduces variability in writing.</i><p>I'm not concerned about this. I think it's an argument for why losing the mentoring and distribution barriers will create more niche markets, fueling the success of self-publishing.<p>> <i>As long as there are publishers who are able to successfully identify and develop such diamonds in the rough, and unless someone comes up with a different way to perform this task, the traditional publishers will not go away. Even if they lose all of the authors who are good enough to jump right into self-publishing, that still leaves them with a significant role in the market, growing great authors.</i><p>Finding ""diamonds in the rough"" may not be enough to sustain a publishing house. This may today be a valuable service but that doesn't mean that it will still be profitable in the future. When amazon launched the kindle, ebooks were mostly priced at 10$. These publishers fought to be able to <i>raise</i> the prices. When all the ""truly great"" become self-publishers they will lower the price of ebooks so now as a publisher you've lost your sure bets and have to instead spend considerable resources (paying all these mentors/editors) on riskier bets that when/if they succeed will have to be priced lower to compete with the self-publishers. I just don't see the economics favoring publishing houses. Being a freelance editor/mentor sourcing authors from first-time self-publishers may very well become a profitable venture though.",1304876493

At that point, the Mac has the following hardware advantages over the Acer:<p>1. 2.0 GHz i7 vs. 1.73 GHz i7 processor.<p>2. 2.54 kg weight vs. 3.3 kg<p>3. 1440x900 display vs. 1366x768. (For another 100 euros, you can make the Apple 1680x1050).<p>4. Dual graphics with automatic switching. The Acer does have faster graphics and more graphics RAM.

The Mac will use a lot less power on graphics, though, especially when you are doing stuff that doesn't make heavy GPU use--like most of the time when programming.<p>5.

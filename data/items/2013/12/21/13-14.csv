So if you don&#x27;t have a CS degree you need the equivalent work experience.<p>I&#x27;m a non-college grad and I think my career up to now has been pretty successful.  It was hard for me, much harder than it should have been if I had a CS degree.  I had to work 2 or 3 times harder than anyone else just to keep up at times.  I found that it wasn&#x27;t the course material that I lacked since I read pretty much the same books as them.  What took me a long time to realize is that all my colleagues were using the same terminologies and most importantly were &quot;thinking&quot; the same way.  The majority of them had either a CS or a physics degree of some kind.<p>Now that I&#x27;m in a position of hiring many developers I&#x27;m not against hiring individuals without degrees, but it definitely helps.  I&#x27;ve hired two developers without degrees.  Both are super bright people but are struggle to keep up as I did.<p>All that said, IMO it&#x27;s who you know not what you know, no matter of your background.  You can get a job in a &quot;big company&quot; without a CS degree if you have the skills and you know the right people.  I did it by attending a bunch of meet-ups to find people with the same interests as me.

After all, I wouldn't expect Yale to try to dissuade finance-types from working on wall street.   Instead, it would make more sense to tout the students' success stories in these two regions - ie., prove that you don't have to go to Stanford to succeed on Sand Hill Road, and that you don't have to go to Columbia to succeed on wall street.",1217543303

If a new use, using current technology, would require 100 W, but using energy-saving technology [developed to save on current use] would only require 50 W, then investment in current savings will produce future savings.

This is no different to physical print newspapers reprinting articles from foreign newspapers. Individual newspapers don't have access to every piece of news. They also reprint material to place their own advertising. Though you might have thought Sitepoint being a Melbourne based company, ""The Age"" would have printed the story and not the other way around. Reading through the entire article the majority of the content is US based companies using this idea to make money.<p>Is ""NYT"" simply reflecting the ""make money"" signal New York emits?  It might also explain why ""The Age"" hasn't bothered and why Melbourne is the ""Artichoke-end"" of the Startup world.",1217541695

Most of the people I look at on Twitter or Google+ have done something so brazenly spammish that I have to go to their profile to find the ""report spam"" link or whatever.  These people aren't my friends, they're just people that spam me that I want to go away.<p>Hardly a social disaster.",1313654395

However, I can't help but find the idea that you have some kind of arcane knowledge that 99% of all programmers don't have is a bit... well, egotistical.

Sometimes it gets so out of control, that in the end the old regime is cast out and a new form of government instituted.<p>The French Revolution was no different. A bunch of hooligans mindlessly rioting and destroying things over some minor matter they should have just let go. But in the end, the king was dead, him and his wife's heads were cut off and spat upon.<p>This round the government got the upper hand. The people in the UK are not happy with how things are going. The revolution is not going to be this month, but it has started this month. The nation is already dead, having abused the people too long. Hard to say how much time they have before the final revolt, but it's obvious to this impartial outside observer that revolution is coming and the momentum is strong enough that throwing dissidents and fools in prison will only hasten its inevitable fall.",1313651448

There was a socialist party guy, Charles Schenck, who thought war was a bunch of BS and the draft was slavery. He printed up 15,000 tracts and passed them out to people. Oliver Wendall Holmes, a fascist if there ever was one, said that criticizing the government was the same thing as ""shouting fire in a crowded theatre"" and you had no right to to such a thing that might bring about a riot. So they sent Schenck to prison.<p>That was the wrong decision. As you are wrong here.<p>The problem with this nonsense is it is provoking people to go from posting gag calls for rioting to realizing the situation is so bad rioting isn't enough. Armed revolution is what is needed. The violent overthrow of the government is inevitable at this point.",1313651331

2898306,comment,2897527,2897838,13,0,saurik,,,"So, I /am/ saurik, and I probably /would/ argue with and work around something like that, as I think I should be allowed to review things in the App Store.<p>Really, the ""official stance"" I have is that developers who believe that having their application fail horribly when the platform is even slightly different is not their fault are deluded: Apple is going to change the platform over time, and when your app fails for Apple they tend to get pissed and just block your app from the store and may even de-prioritize your updates.<p>Seriously: if your app fails because the font is different, there is something epically wrong with your coding methodology; and yes: Apple actually did change the font slightly for the iPhone 4 (on retina screens they switched to Helvetica Neue from Helvetica).<p>Meanwhile, in desktop-land, everyone from large companies to small independent developers deal with this supposedly horrible problem of random fonts, different operating system versions, upgraded libraries, client-side firewalls, or any other number of things that would make developers like kogir freak out, and somehow the world doesn't end, and almost all of the software I download works without issue (with the exception of Chrome on Tablet editions of Windows, and that's squarely Google's fault). (Hell: even almost all of the software on the App Store works under these conditions.<p>What should /really/ happen is that Apple should internally have a different ""test version"" of iOS that developers are not allowed to see; one that has a newer version of SQLite (which I state in specific as developers make all kinds of incorrect assumptions about the SQLite ABI) and has every  core library compiled to the opposite instruction set (Thumb if normally ARM, and vice versa), that has every font replaced with Comic Sans, and uses a different pixel density, on a screen with a slightly different aspect ratio, using a CPU that runs slightly faster than the shipping devices.<p>The reason this needs to be done is that an app that fails to run correctly in that (hidden) configuration is pretty much guaranteed to be an app that is going to stop working when any of the following occur: iOS 6, iPhone Nano, iPad+Retina, or another ""game changing"" device (such as the iPad when it came out). Rather than let these apps in the store just to fail later, they should be weeded out before they even get in.<p>(And yes: Cydia itself strives not to make any assumptions about any of the things listed, and in fact worked almost entirely correctly when loaded for the first time on an iPad with the flag flipped for ""don't show me in a 1x/2x box""; certainly well enough that the reviewer in this scenario would have given it a pass were they testing it in that environment. The one place it tends to get burnt is with what it does to WebKit; and the current implementation, which works fine on everything from 2.0 through 5.0, is likely stable enough to ""stand the test of time"".)<p>(FWIW: I do believe that people using beta versions of iOS should not be able to review applications. These people are using a version of the firmware that is under NDA... they should not be tempted to be providing feedback that might violate that agreement to applications that fail to operate correctly, possibly due to no fault of the app. I have a good example of this related to Cydia on 5.x, but I can't tell you what it is, for this very reason ;P.)",1313651296

2898292,comment,2896328,2896586,4,0,mvzink,,,"I really don't give a shit about the rest of this argument, or yours, but I want to point something out. Plenty of others have quoted this part of your speech:<p><i>helps them see through the seemingly-meaningless boilerplate and social grease that we call people skills</i><p>but I would like to highlight a different aspect of it. Basically, my point (illustrated below, not argued) is that they aren't ""seeing through"" it, they are seeing it wrong.<p>You see, I thought exactly this way about ""people skills"" when I was younger. If those ""extraordinarily talented engineers who have extremely abrasive personalities"" are anything like me, the they see it as <i>boilerplate</i> and <i>grease</i> because they are thinking of the whole thing from the orientation of <i>utility</i>. Employees have a function, customers have a function, engineers have a function, and why can't just you do your goddamn function and let me do mine? This fits with what I've learned from people who match your description. I myself often fashioned my social interactions from that direction quite deliberately. A highly technical engineer doing business would be very likely to approach ""people skills"" as another chore with a beginning, a process, and an end that hopefully meets your goals, for example. Those who think that process is ""meaningless"" are less likely to care how well they do it.<p>Anyway, pretty soon I learned that people are people, not cogs. Now I have more friends, live a happier life, blah blah blah, buy my book and so can you, but most importantly, I've never had bad blood with an employeer, client, or... anyone, really. Nobody thinks I'm abrasive or mean any more, etc. I'm not going to weigh in on my talent, but I would like to think I started from a similar place, socially, to those engineers. I could be totally off base, but I've been thinking about this for a while. Approach interactions as <i>interactions</i>, from one mind to another, and try to <i>communicate with a person</i>.",1313650832

I'm grateful to have consulting work available to me, but at this point I'm so wrapped up in Gittip that I really just can't concentrate on other work.<p>I'm netting almost $200/wk on Gittip right now (thank you!) and if that gets to $800/wk by the end of 2013 I'll be the happiest kid in America. Gittip will be almost born. I'm encouraged that that's only a 4x increase.<p>That said, if Gittip works for me it'll only be because it's working for many other people as well. My focus in the next month or three is going to be on roughing in the features like communities and projects and funds and friend-finding that will help Gittip work for everyone and will get money moving through the system. Then the focus will shift again to building up the contributor community around Gittip, once the pieces are in place to actually get people paid for working on Gittip.<p>Gittip is almost a year old.

Everything was working pretty good, but one of the updates caused sound from VLC to have a lot of static for the first 30 seconds or so after waking from suspend.  But only VLC -- no other apps were affected.  I reverted to an earlier kernel, problem went away.  Seems this was fixed after a couple months on another kernel update (or combination of kernel and VLC update).<p>Secondly -- I picked up a generic USB 5.1 sound card.  All works well, except the center and subwoofer channels are switched.  I've seen a few posts here and there on editing some PulseAudio configs, but they don't seem to apply to the version that Fedora 17 ships with.  But the proper fix is to register this sound module in the ""glitches"" section of the appropriate Kernel driver, and have it swap the channel mappings there.  Still working on finding which data structures the output channel maps are stored in -- if anyone here has worked with programming these kernel modules, let me know and I'll dig up where I left off.",1367897251

His stepmom is a loving, nurturing and influential piece of his life.<p>And he kicks ass: he's smart (probably smarter than me), well-liked, well-adjusted, confident and happy.<p>Seriously, at six he already rocks.  I honestly think he's doing better than if me and his mom were together.",1226721489

He hypothesized that a thriving gay population is a necessary (but not sufficient) characteristic of a locale that embraces the ""Creative Class"".<p>If you believe his premise -- which a lot of folks seem to -- losing a chunk of the gay (and gay-friendly) population is a serious issue for a successful startup-y environment.",1226720789

365113,comment,364219,364886,0,0,ingenium,,,"It's not about having a hospitable environment for reproduction (though gay couples would obviously like to get married before adopting), it's about being able to have the other legal rights that straight married people do, such as hospital visitation and decision rights, health insurance, tax benefits, etc. Civil unions only offer about 1/6 of the legal rights that marriage does.<p>As a gay man, I don't really care what it's called, but the reason we push for ""marriage"" over ""civil unions"" is because of these legal rights. The laws are written for marriage, not civil unions.<p>It's also about the promise of marriage. Where in the typical marriage vows is reproduction mentioned? ""To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part."" That is what it's about...that promise. That commitment with the one you love.",1226719243

It's the exact same message coming from multiple people so its definitely autogenerated.<p>This shady approach, even if it's coming from a 3rd party incentivized to market heysan, mars this otherwise impressive achievment.

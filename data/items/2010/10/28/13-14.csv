Evernote could have written their app in assembly and it'd be screaming fast but it'd be a PITA to maintain. They chose to go C++ because speed is really important to their customers, but I think they're going to have a harder time adding new features and tweaking old ones. With such a robust, flexible system that WPF provides, you're obviously going to have some performance overhead, but creating new features becomes a lot more easy. And perf is obviously going to get better with time simply due to the speed of your average PC.<p>For me, I absolutely <i>love</i> WPF. The thing I love about it is that it is stupid easy to make intuitive UI - I can put any kind of visual element ANYWHERE I want. And using MVVM lets me keep a very nice separation between my business logic and my presentation. In fact, I'm hooking up the same view model to several different views and via declarative binding, changes to one automatically update all the others. Granted, there is a fairly steep learning curve, but there is a lot more training material now than there was 4 years ago.<p>Also, FWIW, I've been doing some Silverlight dev and if SL could step up a little and improve their binding system (WPF's is much more robust), I'd have no problem switching over to Silverlight. I consider them to be two branches of the same tech. I'm expecting a lot more parity between the binding systems in SL 5.",1288274388

What they need is a mounting framework that has a long lifespan, including robust hardware that interconnects with the electrical system.

I realize that part of the difficulties I experience with using TDD in real life is that testing feels ""expensive"" to me, e.g. I frequently spend more time futzing around with test code than I do production code.<p>Your responses illustrate a different perspective, that testing is cheap (this probably comes with experience, I would imagine). Anyhow, I can see that if I thought of tests as cheap, I wouldn't get so hung up on my tests breaking when I change direction on a feature.<p>I also write a fair amount of code that consumes web APIs, so I have lost a lot of hair figuring out to test against those properly without mocking out everything to the point of meaninglessness.",1288274184

This means people either find a match or give up in an average of 6.5 months.<p>The second thing I noticed was that they are very down on the dead profiles.  I haven't used e-harmony, but I suspect there's a way to tell when the person last used the site.  Simply don't message people who haven't logged in for months and you won't have to to worry about it.<p>Much more useful is the fact that they get 12-15k new customers daily.

From the outset, it looks like a big PITA filled with lots of paperwork and formalities involving consultations with accountants and lawyers.

It was the execution that was referred to as 'Turing' rather than the notion that they were being compared by a metric other than looks.

The observer must attempt to identify the computer from the two conversations purely from the responses given.

We have 3-5 solid, repeat clients, so we have some cashflow history (though we are by no means ""raking it in"" -- still only make barely enough to support myself and my family). and I am getting to the point where some capital would be really helpful in both handling what we have now and in growing to handle more.<p>What's the recommended way to get capital in this situation?<p>Banks are sketchy and questionable, I don't trust them at all. And I don't really want a loan because if things turn south I'd rather not be walking around with a huge debt over my head.<p>I also don't really want to deal with a bunch of financial formalities like stock, mainly because I don't have time to study or set up all of that.<p>I understand that I will probably have to do at least one of these anyway. Which is better? I am not an accountant or lawyer and have limited experience in loan-getting, corporate registration, private stock transactions, etc., and would like this to proceed with as little interruption or distraction as possible.<p>Where can I find some benevolent businessmen who would be interested in investing something, so I don't have to try for a loan right away? I live in Utah and my marketing materials are very Utah-centric. I know an investor here but I think he is a bad dude and want to stay as far away from him as possible.<p>Again, this isn't really a startup in the HN sense; this is a normal IT consultancy, we mainly do custom development but have some IT/admin stuff too. I do have plans for product-based startups, but I am trying to bootstrap with consulting because it is a much more straightforward endeavor. Once I have this sufficiently established that it is generating a good, relatively-passive salary for me, I will be interested in expanding into other businesses.<p>In my opinion this should be a pretty straightforward, typical business development deal. We have a cashflow history and have existed for a short while (slightly over one year) and the business could expand significantly if I had a bit of capital to hire some more contractors, etc.<p>All advice appreciated.<p>EDIT: This post is meant to be exploratory and help catalog options available for people in similar situations -- a small business that is starting to get pretty busy and would like to expand and have some additional cash-on-hand so that we can take better care of our current customers and garner up some new ones.<p>The two replies thus far seem to have read in a much more self-entitled tone. Sorry, my intention was not to sound self-entitled or naive; I am fully intent on compensating any investors either via stock or interest, I just want to know what the experienced business community here at HN suggests as the best resources to find interested parties, whether it's a bank, investment group, incubator, whatever, and how to go about the deal in a way that is least likely to disrupt or distract from the primary business.",1288272873

I think it's worth quoting:<p><i>Lets say you’re something like me:  You’ve learned PHP and used it to build and launch “real world” apps.  For you, the cost of change is high (maybe even prohibitively high).  Really hard to justify the change, because though you might grudgingly admit that Python is better, it’s not better enough to warrant switching.  You’ve got a startup to grow, you can’t be bothered with trying to join the cool kids.</i><p><i>But, I’m to advocate for some empathy here.  Lets say you were on the outside looking in (i.e. you’re a gifted developer looking to join a cool new startup).  Since you’re really good, and demand for great developers always exceeds supply, you essentially get to pick where you want to work.  All things being equal, you’re going to pick the place that is doing Python vs. PHP.  Of course, not all things are equal, and you might actually pick the startup whose business you think has the best chances of success or whose founders you like and respect.  But, often, it’s hard to know that stuff upfront, so you focus on what you do know — that developing in Python’s a better “bet”.  I wouldn’t fault people for solving for their self-interest and preference.  They’re not trying to talk you into switching, they’re just saying that it matters to them.</i>",1288272457

For the record, I am not writing this on company time [half an hour lunch break, although he still does this even if I AM on my lunch break]<p>I build websites, web apps, microsites, soon to be Android Apps and iPhone apps. I am in charge of slicing and dicing photoshop templates which we get from our designer (Who sits behind me in the same office) into HTML templates to use with Drupal, CakePHP et al. I am in charge of inputting the copy for said microsites and websites from MS Word documents, this copy is written by the ""Marketing Manager"", who currently sits behind and to the right of me. To the right of where I sit, is my boss, the son of one of the Managing Directors of this company.<p>Do not get the tone of this post wrong, I love my job. I love the people, I love the fact that it's only twenty minutes down the road from my house, I love that parking is provided (although, not on site, about a quarter of a mile down the road). I even love my boss, he's a good, capable man and just wants to get things done and do what's best for this company.<p>However, as my work load has increased over the last two years, and things have gotten more difficult for me (harder problems, taking longer to solve and a lot more thinking) my brain has gotten tired. I've become burnt out maybe three times in the last two years, and have had to take a week off in some cases just to recover from the last project. (Considering we get 20 days holiday and zero sick pay, whenever I AM actually sick, I need to take holiday or I don't get paid for those days).<p>Sometimes, when I have really lost focus, or a problem has just circled in my head for too long to be solved without taking a break from thinking about it, I'll browse HN or reddit, not for very long, just for about 5 or 10 minutes until my head clears. More often than not, I'll be searching for the problem I have and reading articles about it.<p>My boss has the tremendous habit (when he is actually in the dealership), of coming into the office and looking straight at my screen, with the now dreaded words, ""Is that work?"", usually followed by ""Come on [throwaway_burn]! Focus! Get some fucking work done!"".<p>Now, my boss is a very visual person. If he can't instantly see results, he assumed I'm not doing any work. I've just spend four or five weeks creating a completely bespoke front end for building car quotes based on a completely experimental Web Service API built by a car valuation service. They usually make you host an MSSQL server, and they push or replicate their data to your server so you always have an up to date set of data to build cars with. My boss decided that this wasn't the way to go, because it's quite expensive so usually a single dealer group couldn't afford it, hence why you have aggregation systems, and people have it built into their customer management systems. [The web service company] probably lets us use this system for cheap as it is so undocumented when I first started using it, and it very slow, which means I have to pull down the data and store it on a MySQL database anyway, which basically means I had to code a script to automatically get the data from their web services and store it in our database every night. There is a huge amount of data in their systems and I only pull the data for four manufacturers.<p>So I built the scripts. I built the front end, even though certain things weren't documented, I managed to get them to finally send me some documentation on how to use their data effectively, and as of yesterday, the site is finally complete and finished.<p>Needless to say, it doesn't really look like it should have taken four or five weeks of work to produce the site, considering some other sites I've done, excluding the bespoke car price quoting system have taken two days at most. In fact, the actual site only took two days to build around the drupal module I made to interface with my back end data. As far as my boss is concerned, I've been sitting on my ass browsing HN and reddit for four weeks, and then took a week and a half to complete the site once I was bored with not working.<p>It has come to the point where whenever he starts his rant, I put my headphones on, or I shout at him, or I get very angry and walk off for a while. I really cannot work under these conditions for very much longer, and to be honest I am really ashamed with how I am handling his rants and outbursts.<p>I have built so many sites, systems for publishing stock to stock aggregates, systems for publishing stock to our own websites using different data we get back from the other dealerships, loyalty systems, niche seo websites, you name it, I've done it. I have made this man and this company a lot of money, and it's cost them a little over two years of my salary, which is paltry to say the least with how much I've worked.<p>They even outsourced me to develop a ticketing system for a [potentially recognisable car service] company, to the tune of more than half my annual salary for four weeks work.<p>It's an abusive environment, regardless of the fact that it's overlooked if I come in 20 minutes late in the morning, so long as I make it up at the end.<p>I'm in horrible position though, I really do like my boss in every other capacity other than a boss. His lack of understanding of what it is I do, and the fact that he can't seem to a) estimate how long a project will take me, and b) realise that not all programming work is instantly visible makes me think that I am going to quit in an epic fashion of diving off the balcony head first into an R8 Spyder and break my neck on the fucking windscreen.<p>Therein lies the problem. Where I live, there are no jobs. Some statistics recently suggested that a snowball had a better chance of opening an ice cream shop in the deepest layer of hell than I have of getting another job.<p>Although I have two years experience (more than double that if you count the freelancing I have done in a non salaried position) in PHP, MySQL, HTML, Javascript, LAMP Server administration, networking, etc, there aren't enough jobs to go around the unemployed in this city, let alone some guy with no degree.<p>Trying to discuss this with him really isn't working. Any advice?<p>TL;DR: Does anyone else browse the net in work when they are having a hard time focusing, but not blatantly trying to hide it and yet get rebuked even when the only other option is to sit, knuckles dragging drooling on the keyboard whilst staring at the screen because your brain no longer works?",1288271837

I'm not sure how people write solid code with any kind of speed without a harness testing/driving it. Why not make your harness your tests?<p>Everyone keeps talking about how it is more work, which confuses me. I don't make a religion out of test coverage, so maybe that is the difference? As in, I don't write a test for every basic thing, like an accessor, for example, because I feel like there's a point of diminishing returns.<p>edit: To those downvoting, I'm interested in a dialogue and hearing your thoughts.",1288271511

In fact, he has been consistently against printing money because of it's leading to inflation.<p>You can interpret his comments on the BOJ in the article that he would support buying government bonds only as a way to provide liquidity to banks.

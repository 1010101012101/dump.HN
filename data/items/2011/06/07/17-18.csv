Without having read all the details of iCloud, I very much hope the following is possible:<p>App Foo on my Mac has some data, that it can encrypt into the iCloud, and App Foo on my iPhone get access that data. iCloud is just a storage, but I hope Apps can actually encrypt the data before they load it into the cloud. Now that would be something I would look forward too. Cloud computing is fine, but I want it to be the App developers choice to encrypt the hell out of my data so that iCloud has no idea what I actually own.<p>Google has cloud storage for all sorts of stuff, but they have access to it.",1307469595

Again, a pattern created by Stalin in which his ""dictatorship of the proletariat"", or the governing clique rules quasi-divinely in the interest of the people and is not subject to any limits on their power.<p>You've got to see it in terms of how the ex-communist oligarchy sees it.  The airport was not upgraded by the financiers.  They merely found the capital and hired the people to do it.  It was the workers, the citizens of the Russian federation who made the upgrades to the airport with their hard work.

The rest are proprietary platforms like iOS.<p>If the browser platform is not around in 10 years, I hope that means it has gotten superseded by a more powerful open platform that is not owned by anyone.<p>But I do not see any potential for a revolutionary change in the way we consume the web. What I expect (or maybe hope for) is just browsers that keep getting more powerful, I expect evolutionary progress in the browser space. And I expect the browser model to remain the dominant web platform, because it is open and it is good enough--there are no other paradigms that blow it away; Adobe Air, Java, and iOS are just more of the same (whether it runs in a browser, on Air, JRE or iOS, it is still an app).<p>Therefore since all of these platforms are based on the same principles and they all do the same thing, what we need is to improve the web platform to be the best one.<p>If we find out that there are certain bottlenecks that will make it impossible for the web to be as fast and shiny as the others, we'll need to re-engineer the parts that are causing the bottleneck. What is it that makes iOS apps faster and shinier than web apps? Couldn't we add new technologies or improve the current ones to allow web apps to be just as good if not better?",1307469234

I'm in a fairly broad industry (business coaching) and I have colleagues who, variously, work with businesses from solopreneurs to listed multi-nationals, across countless industries, 27 countries (and counting), and on projects that range from cashflow management to cultural purpose and intent. I can, and have, helped businesses with all of that myself.<p>But if I asked you for a referral and told you I was looking for a business of any size in any industry in any country that needed any guidance, how many would come to mind? Zero, or at least none that you felt were specific enough to refer to me. In fact, you probably wouldn't refer to me because it sounds like I'm saying I can do everything and that's probably (and actually) not true.<p>Alternatively: ""I am looking for young, energetic business owners in London, turning over 2M-20M per annum and looking to grow by learning from someone else's experience"".<p>How many come to mind now? Probably still none, especially if you're not in London. But for the people who can make the right referral for me, the specific definition of my ideal client makes it easier to understand who I want an introduction to, and for them to make that introduction.<p>So whether for a job or your next client, I whole-heartedly agree that knowing what you ideally want and being able to articulate that will lead to results.",1307469134

Does gold or any other precious metal stay at a fixed resource, does anyone hoarding gold make it any less valuable?<p>2) As mentioned above, bitcoins can be traded in almost any fraction thereof, simply having each coin be worth 2 million dollars, is irrelevant.<p>3) If too many people start hoarding and there is no exchange of coin, it is possible that the value of coins will decrease instead of increasing. Please remember that the only value assigned to the coins will be the value that individuals are willing to assign to it, or pay to acquire it, or amount of coins willing to exchange for goods or services.<p>4) We've had commodity backed currencies for much, much more of recorded history than we've had fiat currencies and yet we've brought civilization to where it is today.

Garbage collection is something that happens at run time by a garbage collector via an algorithm like mark-and-sweep, tri-colour marking, etc, and as a block of code that's called at runtime it A) has a lot of information about your program and B) has a nontrivial performance impact.<p>Unfortunately I can't talk specifics (stupid NDA), but schrototo has said that it's a compiler-level feature, which would automatically disqualify it as being a bona fide garbage collector.<p>Speaking generically, any static feature is going to a great deal less powerful than its dynamic equivalent.  Thinking of compile-time memory management as garbage collection is not just a leaky abstraction, it's a broken water main flooding into the street.<p>Think less ""auto pilot"" and more ""cruise control"".

Just the delays from the bottlenecked building approval process can cause plant construction to run up billions of dollars in loan interest while they're waiting for the red tape to clear.<p>China is currently building CPR1000 plants cheaper than coal plants of the same capacity. These are not meltdown-prone clunkers; they are upgraded versions of French designs with a good safety record. They're also starting a buildup of Westinghouse AP1000 plants, built to the usual western standards of safety and redundancy, and they're doing it a lot cheaper than the US and Europe. We see similar things in South Korea, which gets a large portion of its energy from nuclear plants, and is now beginning to export them.<p>Considering how much safer nuclear power is than coal, paranoid regulations are actually making us quite a bit less safe by crippling our ability to build nuclear plants.",1307467606

If people have only licensed the songs on a particular service or device they might find it painful to leave but if that pain is less than the cost of maintaining the service then they will leave.

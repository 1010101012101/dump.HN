Until then, we&#x27;re researching in a flawed framework.  Creating a student-teacher bond, making students feel valued, making parents feel like their kids are getting something out of their tax dollars, long-term impacts on students, student eagerness to engage in a lesson...  I question whether neuroscience has explored these aspects.  Let alone teacher job satisfaction.<p>Cripes, we&#x27;re seeing all kinds of proof that we&#x27;re beating creativity out of students.  I can guarantee that mixing up how lessons are taught has a positive impact on student creativity.  Does each student have their preferred learning style?  I can&#x27;t say that.  But I strongly suspect that teaching lessons in varied styles has a positive impact.<p>Relevant: <a href=""http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3978"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3978</a>",1452200352

On the contrary, matter falling into the black hole will form an accretion disk that radiates heat back to you. In order to maximize dissipation, they would simply radiate it away into all directions uniformly.<p>However, there might be other considerations to take into account here besides physics. It might be important to such an isolated civilization to avoid detection. In that case they would gladly take the hit on efficiency and radiate their heat in narrow cones into the gaps where no nearby stars are located.<p>> <i>An advanced alien civilization will probably have very low radiation signature.

Fact is, big rewrites are very risky and there&#x27;s nothing appealing about working on them, I can attest!  Any developer worth his salt should fight tooth and nail to kill such a rewrite project and then run screaming when business and management go forward anyhow with scrapping the working legacy system in order to &quot;start fresh&quot;.<p>Lost opportunity does suck.  It would be nice if the first system was written in an extensible way with lots of tests and correct documentation, but it rarely is.  All software needs to be replaced at some point.  All software has a finite useful lifespan.  So, this is a common problem.  But you must have a responsible plan for replacing any first system.  Any sort of project plan that has a magic day where the legacy system is shutdown and the second system is turned on is reckless and absurd.  I&#x27;ve heard of failure rates for such projects being 80%, with the rest going way over budget before completion.<p>The best you can do when replacing a crufty old system is to employ strangulation.  You slowly, methodically kill off the legacy system one feature at a time with the equivalent features in the well-written/tested new system.  You run both systems side by side, sharing the processing load until one day, years in the future, when you have replaced all the features and the legacy system has nothing to do.  It&#x27;s a hassle and it requires everyone to be organized from start to finish, but you eliminate the big-bang release risks.<p>Luckily, with all the web services and factored out componentry we&#x27;ve been building in software over the past 10 years, the strangulation approach has never been more feasible.<p>There&#x27;s lots of good youtube lectures and agile community blog posts on the topic of second systems and strategies to implement the strangulation.

I&#x27;m all for observing and analyzing unsuspecting people - that&#x27;s the only reasonable way you can avoid the effect of people changing their behavior when they know they&#x27;re being studied. I think that the biggest issue here is not with scaling, or even with finding a reliable subset of the data - it&#x27;s with fitting such experiment into formal and ethical framework of science. Some of the issues I see:<p>- Scientists generally <i>design</i> their studies, trying to amplify the visibility of studied phenomenon while filtering out as much noise as possible. Here you&#x27;d have an experiment that&#x27;s not designed. My guess is that it&#x27;s something most researchers are not used to nowadays.<p>- It may be hard to reuse this technique. The first team to run this study may have some results that we could trust, but as soon as they publish and everyone knows that apps are now used to study people, users will change behavior.<p>- It creates a whole <i>battlefield</i> of interest. It suddenly is in the interest of scientists and their research institutions to promote commercial apps. It&#x27;s also in the interest of the app vendors to enter into agreements with researchers, because getting an interesting result will become a huge marketing opportunity.

Which is that there is absolutely no way to lock in good query plans.  It always reserves the right to switch plans on you, and sometimes gives much, much, much worse ones.  No other database does this to me.  Even MySQL&#x27;s stupid optimizer can be reliably channeled into specific query plans with the right use of temporary tables and indexes.<p>This is a problem because improvements don&#x27;t matter if the query plan is &quot;good enough&quot;.  But they will care if you screw up.  PostgreSQL usually does well, but sometimes screws up spectacularly.<p>The example that I have been struggling the most often with in the last few months is a logging table that I create summaries from.  Normally I only query minutes to hours, but I set it up as a series of SQL statements so I first put the range in a table, and then have <i>happened BETWEEN range_start AND range_end</i>.  PostgreSQL really, Really, REALLY wants to decide that the index on the timestamp is a bad idea, and wants to instead do a full table scan.  Every time it does, summarization goes from under a second to taking hours.<p>Hopefully the new BRIN indexes will be understood by the optimizer in a way that makes it happier to use the index.

I physically cannot split a check more then 6 ways and the customer is asking or 7 ways, then what am I suppose to do? Be &quot;nice&quot; and promise the impossible? So now I pissed off a customer who&#x27;s about to tip me because I cannot reprogram the POS.<p>2. The more likely scenario is when a table of 7, who just had pre-fix brunch is asking me to split a $70 check 7 ways which takes my time away from my couple who just dropped $70 by themselves.<p>What customers in restaurants don&#x27;t understand is that tipping might be optional but my time is money. As a customer is tipping on service, I&#x27;m also providing service comparable to the tip I receive.<p>Waiters are really good at &quot;guessing&quot; how much a customer will tip and will act on that belief.<p>Disclaimer:\nI worked with a ton of awful waiters who were straight up rude to good guests. No guest should ever be treated poorly.<p>Ive also served some awful customers:<p>Some of them tipped very, very well because they wanted to be awful. I loved those assholes and always welcomed them with open arms - money&#x27;s green regardless.<p>Some were just awful and I tried to steer clear of them.<p>Now as an olive branch; all guests should be treated with outmost respect and all people in the service industry should be as well",1452198625

How can you make sense of the partial file? if you just need a flat file which can be parsed and data recovered, then you didnt need HDF in the first place. So wrong motivation to pick HDF. On the other hand, one could do a new file for every checkpoint / iteration / step, which is what most people do. If app crashed, you just use the last checkpoint.<p>Bugs and crashes in the HDF5 library and in the wrappers - sure, every sw has bugs.

If the &quot;parallel access&quot; refers to threading, HDF has a thread safe feature that you need to enable when building the code. If &quot;parallel access&quot; refers to access from multiple processes, then HDF is not the right file format to use. you could do it for read-only purposes but not write. again, not the right motivation to pick HDF<p>Impossibility to explore datasets with standard Unix/Windows tools - again, HDF is not a flat file, so how can one expect standard tools to read it? its like saying I would like to use standard tools to explore a custom binary file format I came up with. wrong expectations.<p>Hard dependence on a single implementation of the library - afaik there is only one implementation of the spec. the author seems to know this before deciding on HDF. Why is this an issue if its already known?<p>High complexity of the specification and the implementation -<p>Opacity of the development and slow reactivity of the development team - slow reactivity to what? HDF source is available so one can go fix / modify whatever they want.<p>seems the author picked HDF with wrong assumptions.<p>HDF serves a huge community that has specific requirements, one of which is preserving precision, portability, parallel access, being able to read/write datasets, query the existing file for information of the data in the file, multi dimensional datasets, large amount of data to fit in a single file, etc.<p><a href=""https://www.hdfgroup.org/why_hdf/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hdfgroup.org/why_hdf/</a>",1452198442

10860483,comment,10858375,10859266,0,0,api,,,"I&#x27;ve lived in both Boston and California. All of what I&#x27;m about to say comes from the small sample size that is personal experience and therefore YMMV, but this is my observation.<p>The most important difference between Boston (and the East Coast in general) and California is this: On the East Coast and in most other places, business culture has a kind of de-facto caste system in which executives, managers, and owners by definition are separate from and out-rank <i>doers</i>. To <i>do</i> is not to <i>own</i>, and to <i>own</i> is not to <i>do</i>.<p>In Boston if you roll up your sleeves and actually <i>do</i> the work, this makes you lower class compared to the executives who manage, own, and control. On one occasion I had this actually explained to me explicitly and the explanation included the phrase &quot;CEOs don&#x27;t do anything&quot; stated as if this were a fact and a law of nature. It was explicitly explained to me that for a CXO-type person to actually get their hands dirty with real work was a dangerous distraction that would negatively impact their ability to lead.<p>In California, being a maker and a doer is respected equally and in some cases more than being a manager or a hustler. The extreme end of this is the CA startup culture where being a &quot;non-technical founder&quot; is sometimes seen as a liability. A founder might eventually transition to mostly managerial work but having a background and having been the original builder of the product is seen as a good thing and a badge of honor.<p>At the very least, being a maker and a doer in California does not count against you and mark you as lower class the way it does in Boston. It doesn&#x27;t by definition mean you can&#x27;t lead, found, or own.<p>This is why I left Boston. I couldn&#x27;t stand it. The message I got from the culture is that I was a sucker for trying to get good at actually doing things. I don&#x27;t have What It Takes and therefore I can only work for those who do. What It Takes is never quite defined but I gathered it to be a mixture of extroversion, a very dominant personality type, and mild to moderate narcissism. Skills and abilities and experience don&#x27;t factor into it unless that experience is exclusively within the business realm.<p>East Coast: &quot;I&#x27;ll have my people talk to your people.&quot; -- the ideal archetype of the East Coast business elite would be Donald Trump or Carl Icahn.<p>West Coast: &quot;Here let me get on that.&quot; -- the ideal archetype here is Elon Musk or Larry Page.<p>East Coast: &quot;We&#x27;re looking to hire people from the right schools.&quot; (I actually heard this multiple times and even read it in print at least once. Skills were not mentioned.)<p>West Coast: &quot;We&#x27;re looking to hire people with the right skills.&quot;<p>I also felt more <i>classism</i> in general on the East Coast. The fact that I&#x27;m originally from Ohio and went to a small Midwestern university meant I wasn&#x27;t fit to mop the floor. The West Coast certainly has its Stanford cult but the Ivy League cult on the East is orders of magnitude more intense and pervasive. I know and do business with a number of high-ranking Stanford types and <i>never</i> have I gotten the sense that I&#x27;m a &quot;plebeian&quot; simply because I don&#x27;t have an impressive university name behind me. If I&#x27;m talking to a Stanford Ph.D and what comes out of my mouth is intelligent, it feels like a conversation between equals and I don&#x27;t get the sense that my opinions are inherently suspect.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. There is absolutely class in California, and if you&#x27;re not from a top-tier university or an otherwise impressive background you will probably have to work harder to achieve a similar level of cred in most circles. But you <i>can</i>. Class is malleable here and if you demonstrate merit I&#x27;ve found that people respond <i>quickly</i>. By contrast out East it feels fixed by birth and education. After being there for years and working really really hard I did gradually feel like I&#x27;d risen a bit but it felt like a really slow process with a constant undertow. I did find that if I stopped referring to my educational background or place of origin people started to assume I&#x27;d gone to a place like MIT, so I could sort of sneak in under the radar and only reveal my beginnings once I&#x27;d thoroughly demonstrated ability. Out East I was actually tempted to lie about my education (never did), while out West the idea seems preposterous and silly.<p>There are exceptions in both places of course, but that was the general cultural zeitgeist I ran into. I imagine it might be even worse in a place like Washington DC where it&#x27;s all about political clout.",1452198324

After the breach the buyer got back the $900, but is still $5100 worse off than if the seller had fulfilled his part of the bargain. Those are the expectancy damages he suffered.<p>Given that going to this specific game is a unique experience that can&#x27;t be duplicated a court could order specific performance (i.e. that the tickets be handed over) as tacon suggests below. But: 1) I don&#x27;t think small claims courts can order specific performance, 2) you probably couldn&#x27;t get before a small claims court judge in time, and 3) if the seller didn&#x27;t actually have the ticket then he couldn&#x27;t be ordered to turn it over.

MySQL&#x27;s manuals are littered with &quot;if X is enabled then this behavior is different, and in versions since 5.7.3.5 this behavior has been changed slightly, and 5.7.3.6 has a bug that silently swallows errors&quot;, etc. MySQL&#x27;s historical date and NULL handling alone is worth a chapter of any book.<p>Postgres also has a level of strictness above MySQL, which is in itself instructive. You know when you&#x27;re doing something wrong. Postgres never accepts bad input. It always requires a strictly correct configuration setup.<p>Plus: Just type \h in psql. It has a complete reference of the entire SQL syntax.",1452196894

Good the author realized how important it is to overall earnings.<p>On blogs or whatever, I can be pretty blunt and harsh. With my customers, I walk a tight rope between being aggressive and being gentle almost always moderate. I&#x27;m quick to concede something to customer if the overall value proposition is still good for long-term or it&#x27;s a little thing that can&#x27;t hurt my image. Past that, I might try to shift blame from them or I to the circumstances of the situation while portraying us as a team handling it. Pissing them off is the last thing you want to do, though, given long-term is more important.<p>Author either skimmed over or didn&#x27;t mention two things, though. One is that customers often talk to other potential customers. Even those you &quot;fire&quot; you should separate from on good terms or not too harshly if possible. They can spread word fast through other clients who are then more likely to turn down contracts.<p>The other issue is the clients asking too much: many do it on purpose. There&#x27;s so many hustlers out there who play proper capitalist by always getting as much as possible while giving as little as possible. So, you need to determine ahead of time what&#x27;s your willing to commit to, possible extras, possible compromises, and absolute upper-bounds for any given job/client. Then, stick to it and politely if people are pushing it too much. Give those types an inch, they&#x27;ll take a mile: you go from profitable, independent consultant to many to practically under-paid employee of one.<p>Things to remember.",1452196875

It never used more than 6GB (and CPU was mostly negligible). Doh. Oh well, better to have spent too much than too little.<p>We also have a separate front-end server which does our SSL, so that our private keys don&#x27;t reside on the same server as apps, just as an extra precaution. That machine is just a regular n1-standard-1 instance. CPU usage was in the single digit percentages there as well.<p>You can indeed run your own Sandstorm instance.

I bought my first house in 2009, and used an inspector that my real estate agent recommended.  The house was 25 years old at the time and he created a report full of minor issues, but no deal breakers.<p>I intended to live in that house for a long time, but had to sell it this spring.  Got an offer in a month. All the minor things had been fixed and a I also made a lot of improvements.  Then the buyers inspection found that a truss had been cut and removed in the attic by a bad HVAC guy.  Ended up costing me > $1500 to have it assessed by a structural engineer and repaired, and almost caused the deal to fall through.<p>Once the missing truss was pointed out to me, it was very obvious, and should have been caught by an inspector on his first day.

Anyway, if a farmer is supposed to be growing soybeans, they cannot grow (for example) potatoes.  There have been cases of farmers having crops meant for family consumption that have been sued (or raided? -- something way over the top for the violation, anyway).  IIRC, the big gun that it used is the interstate commerce clause.  So if a spud farmer in Idaho wants a few bushels of wheat for his family,  his growing it would (supposedly) impact market value on wheat prices.<p>There&#x27;s some scary stuff in the farming regulation.  There was a law in the works called NAIS (national animal ID system)that severely intrudes on people&#x27;s right to raise their own livestock.

This happens in Wine and coffee too. The reality is many &quot;distillers&quot; are curators and finishers, and sometimes battlers (sometimes not, whoever bottles or makes the Templeton Rye-like bottle must bottle half of the craft market). In wine, this smaller places will buy grapes or wines from the larger vineyards, and often make blends as well. For coffee, most businesses in the Bay Area hit up Royal Coffee in Oakland for their green coffee.  Definitely everybody from Peet&#x27;s and Starbucks to Blue Bottle and Philz have used them, according to my girlfriends father who has used them for 25 years. or tea leaves. even then, a lot of people hit up roasters to supply them roasts or blends.<p>So, the modern beverage industry is largely an industry based on curation, blends, and added value. And that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m not so sure why people care so much, but it must be because people have this romantic view that their beverages should live up to some farm-to-table ideal.",1406651997

Some people use it to mean <i>substitute the license on your copy with some other license, and then pass copies on under that new license.</i>  This appears to be the way the FAQ uses the term.  The way you use the term, you seem to think that you can actually do some magic and revoke the author&#x27;s rights, then impose your conditions on him, and possibly sue him for violating these conditions.  That&#x27;s just bullshit, it doesn&#x27;t work like that.  Unless you know something the rest of the world doesn&#x27;t.<p>You keep saying copyright licenses are used to &quot;forfeit&quot; (by which I assume you mean <i>surrender</i>) rights, so as to (exclusively) transfer them from you to someone else.  It doesn&#x27;t work like that.  They are used to <i>grant</i> other people rights.  They normally do not remove any rights from the author.<p>And you still maintain your circular definition of copyright, in which authorhood or copyright itself is a right protected by copyright and that through one of the rights protected by copyright (and granted to you by an author&#x27;s license), you can obtain that right which is copyright (or authorhood).

Here&#x27;s a simple toy one, designed to eliminate the bad incentives discussed by freakonomics:<p>Say you have a tiny house that could reasonably sell in the range $90k-$110k, depending on how hard the broker works.  If you give the broker 5% of the sales price, then he gets $5k on average, but on the margins he only sees $50 for every $1k he can raise the price by negotiating.  So instead, give him 50% of ever dollar of the sales price <i>over</i> $90k.  Now he still makes $5k on average (i.e. 50% of the average $10k over the lower-bound of $90k), but on the margins he gets $500 for every $1k he increases the price by negotiating hard!<p>Needless to say, there are all sorts of other ideas smart people could come up with.  Often, the reason these don&#x27;t work is because they seem <i>complicated</i>, and it&#x27;s hard as a consumer to assess to broker-fee structure itself (a sort of market failure).  But there&#x27;s a good chance that technology can change this, by making info related to broker fee structures more accessible and more transparent.  For instance, data about average broker fees, the distribution of house sales prices, etc. could be collected by a tech start-up, which would have been unfeasible to collect in the past.",1406650971

I was looking at other browsers to replace Firefox, as I got sick of it, and I picked Conkeror.<p>Conkeror has a neat little feature called content-policy.  I can block kinds of crap per session or site (Flash, JS, Fonts, Object tags, Images, you name it).  I use this and by default all our  blocked completely.  I can reload a buffer when I need it (even on HN I leave all this crap off).  I used NoScript before and I like this as more basic and defensive tool built into the browser core.  Check it out.<p>For when I do use Javascript (this is on Linux of course), I uses hostsblock[0] to redirect all blacklisted sites in /etc/hosts to a local DNS proxy on 127.0.01 on my laptop (dnsmasq, which we all probably know, and you could set it up upstream on a router or server for a group of people).  Then I use kwakd as recommended to serve white space for all these redirected domains.<p>The end result, now I open up JS when I need, and like 100,000 domains are blocked.  I check when certain shady domains are mentioned to look for stones unturned, and I rarely see exceptions that are not listed (by default even no cookie YouTube domains are blocked, so JS-less pages give you a blank YouTube box on sites a lot).<p>So why all this effort?  Because this is the second or third time I read &quot;ad-blocking company not as dedicated as you think to your principles&quot; articles.  And people who argue &quot;my website needs your ad revenue&quot; you ask?  Honestly, fuck &#x27;em.  I can&#x27;t be bothered.  Be adults, as you do not believe in legislation on Minority Report-like ads following me around in realtime while I walk in public or forcing my eyes open to read newspaper and billboards just for ads, I think I have the right to voluntarily ignore them as I will not buy your shit or shill for you anyway and it is waste of both of our time.  I do not mandate everyone look away, but give me the privilege too thank you very much.  And I know a company cannot be trusted long term to defend this right as it is not in their interest, especially if it is their core model ad companies (all mentioned here Adblock, Ghostery, disconnect.me will change their tune if they have not already say).<p>In short, do not use corporate-backed tools for this.  Said companies always change their mind.<p>[0] More info here: <a href=""http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/12/28/hostsblock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/12/28/hostsblock/</a><p>UPDATE: Fixed cue typo.

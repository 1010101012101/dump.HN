7769685,comment,7768912,7768912,2,0,bobwaycott,,,"I find it particularly amusing how many commenters are complaining about the lack of statement/explanation on the security model & encryption used behind the scenes--especially those comments suggesting one should hold out for such an explanation before using this service. Not because that isn&#x27;t helpful information to have, but because it does not, in fact, provide the slightest shred of increased security, or additional reasons to trust this app (or any others).<p>I mean, the state of HN comments on things like Torpedo all tend to feature such a ring of comments warning everyone to not try something when there isn&#x27;t a statement about security/encryption. And yet, such a statement is absolutely worthless for decision-making or increased trust. Anybody could write a statement promising all manner of security/encryption awesomeness all over the things they make. We could have a team put out an app that claims it has encrypted its own source code with AES256 4,096 times before deploying to servers and that everything you do is encrypted a billion times over, and it&#x27;s just fucking words. Yeah, nobody would trust something that claimed that, I&#x27;m sure, cos it sounds ridiculous. But it&#x27;s not inherently more or less trustable and/or secure based on the content alone.<p>If you&#x27;re basing your decisions about who to trust on their words, you&#x27;re using the wrong metric. &quot;We delete everything, trust us&quot; is no different from &quot; the contents of secrets are encrypted with a randomly generated key, using AES 256 bit encryption, before being stored in our database. The key is then embedded in the share URL for the secret. We don&#x27;t store the key nor the URL in our DB, so the only way to decrypt it is with the URL.&quot;[1]<p>None of this is to suggest you shouldn&#x27;t trust the guys behind Torpedo and their app. I think you should. But even my words don&#x27;t matter. No mere statement about security/encryption can be trusted based on the words alone. You can only <i>actually</i> trust something if you&#x27;ve been able to verify that it complies with the statement. And very few of the services anyone uses allow their users to obtain that level of verification.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7769443"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7769443</a>",1400532862
7769684,comment,7767420,7769190,2,0,cnkeller,,,"Background: I had a personal issue that required me to sell my house in silicon valley and move closer to my parents on the east coast. Rather than let me go, the company offered to pay for my relocation and let me work from home (I work at a pretty traditional company, not a tech giant so I was surprised). About six months after, I moved teams within the company, so my new team was okay with me coming on board while remote. Since then, I&#x27;ve moved teams (and physical locations) again, and the new team was also fine. Most folks are either at customer sites or in the various corporate offices, but there are plenty of folks who seem to do what I do and just work remote. It&#x27;s a bit more common than I would have thought honestly for a &quot;corporate culture&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve not been asked to relocate, I&#x27;ve not taken any salary reductions, or had any &quot;negative&quot; behavior as a result. It&#x27;s the main reason I&#x27;ve rewarded their loyalty to me with my loyalty to them. If someone needs me, they either call me or email me. Pretty simple. If I need to get on a plane (a few times) for a meeting, I just do it. But between conference calls, screen sharing via webex, etc it&#x27;s pretty manageable.<p>Part of the reason I believe it works is because I don&#x27;t let being remote be an issue. I pick up my phone when it rings, I check email constantly, I&#x27;m available via multiple chat systems, and I get things done. It absolutely helps that at some point, when crossing time zones and countries, everyone is somewhat remote. You can&#x27;t have a 90K person company in the same place.<p>I do not do all of the &quot;recommended things&quot; that they say when working remote. I don&#x27;t get dressed and &quot;go to work&quot;. I get up, grab a protein shake, sit in front of my computer in my sleepwear like I would if it was a weekend. I don&#x27;t have a dedicated work room, I work in the same place I play video games and work on personal projects. What it comes down to is that while others are commuting, I&#x27;m answering email. While other people are going out to lunch, I&#x27;m working on architectures with a bowl of beef and veggies. While they&#x27;re taking snow days, I&#x27;m working uninterrupted. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m more productive (though I suppose we could all find ways to be more productive), but I&#x27;m certainly as productive.<p>Some random thoughts:<p>I shop for seven days worth of food because I cook all my meals every day. I eat much better.\nMy ISP (Charter) is rock solid and high speed. In a pinch my mobile would be my email backup.\nI do not ask for any reimbursement for costs and I don&#x27;t write anything off tax wise.\nJobs will come and go, but for the first few years of my sons life I was here every single day watching him grow up. I&#x27;ll never be able to get that back if I missed it.\nWherever possible, I shift the burden of being remote to me. I never say &quot;well, I&#x27;m remote and don&#x27;t own a fax machine&quot;. I just make it happen. I often start controversial conversations with &quot;well, do you need me to fly in?&quot;<p>As a final thought, I get a lot of recruiters (don&#x27;t we all though) contacting me. Strangely enough, it&#x27;s usually the startups that seem to have a problem working remote. The first thing I tell people is that I&#x27;m while I have no problems flying in for meetings (either my cost or theirs), I&#x27;m content staying as a remote employee for now. In the future, we can discuss relocation. 95 times out of 100, regardless of the fit or role, it&#x27;s a deal breaker in the first five minutes. Just find that interesting and it&#x27;s a great way to pre-screen potential employers.",1400532860

7769678,comment,7769560,7769560,2,0,trcollinson,,,"With all respect, and I do mean that, if the roles were reversed, what options would you give you? You have a company that was working, and a member of the team changed the rules of the game. The company took the risk for a year, and that risk did not result in a reward, so the company has now given you some very fair options. Obviously, something needs to change and the company is putting the ball in your court to decide how to make that work. That is an opportunity right there! He could have easily done the thing many companies do and just fired you with no warning.<p>That being said, I will take a stab at answering your questions. First, do you think your sales strategy will be changing, ie, become more successful? If not, then you should not take commission. Of course, if your sales strategy won&#x27;t become more successful, why would they keep you? But I digress. Where you live, is it hard to find new work in your particular area of expertise? If not, then I would say resign, and find new work. If it is, then I would suggest you need to really think through your career path. In other words, resign if you think you can&#x27;t make commission sales work. Take commission and become truly successful if you think your sales can improve.<p>Second, I have hired many employees over the years. I have never asked if they were on unemployment. I don&#x27;t care one way or the other. The economy in my area has been rough for a long time, I don&#x27;t take of unemployment as being a negative. Your milage my vary.<p>Third, if it&#x27;s not in your original contract, don&#x27;t expect it. If you are in a sales position and have brought in less revenue than you make in salary over the last year, don&#x27;t expect it. If you work for a small company that is working hard but isn&#x27;t ultra successful, don&#x27;t expect it. So, don&#x27;t expect it.<p>I hope my best advise is to not be afraid of finding new work. Get out there, hit the pavement, make yourself look great and get the job that makes you feel good. You&#x27;re in sales. This is your greatest sales job. Go sell yourself. And good luck!",1400532814

Here is a choice quote:<p>&quot;I did not bill Intel for consulting hours spent on those aspects of the i8087 design that were transferred to IEEE p754. I had to be sure, not only in appearance and actuality but above all in my own mind, that I was not acting to further the commercial interest of one company over any other. Rather I was acting to benefit a larger community. I must tell you that members of the committee, for the most part, were about equally altruistic. IBM&#x27;s Dr. Fred Ris was extremely supportive from the outset even though he knew that no IBM equipment in existence at the time had the slightest hope of conforming to the standard we were advocating. It was remarkable that so many hardware people there, knowing how difficult p754 would be, agreed that it should benefit the community at large. If it encouraged the production of floating-point software and eased the development of reliable software, it would help create a larger market for everyone&#x27;s hardware. This degree of altruism was so astonishing that MATLAB&#x27;s creator Dr. Cleve Moler used to advise foreign visitors not to miss the country&#x27;s two most awesome spectacles: the Grand Canyon, and meetings of IEEE p754.&quot;<p>Also, please read ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼&quot;What every Computer Scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic&quot; available at <a href=""https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/NumericalAnalysis/02Numerics/Double/paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/NumericalAnalysis/02Numer...</a>.",1400532156

7769569,comment,7767658,7769249,6,0,emn13,,,"JsPerf is really well known, but unfortunately, it also very poorly suited for this kind of performance comparison:<p>1. JSperf doesn&#x27;t encourage any kind of validation that the various snippets actually do the same thing.  I&#x27;m not kidding when I say that almost all jsperfs I read are buggy.  This one is too; it reuses the same pre-cached nodes without cloning them, and those aren&#x27;t semantics you want and aren&#x27;t comparable with innerHTML.<p>2. JSperf&#x27;s scaling is terrible.  It&#x27;s showing ops/sec rather than sec/ops, when the latter is much more interesting.  Almost always you&#x27;re interested in keeping UI latency low, not in somehow repeating as many operations per second; the ops/sec display emphasizes tiny differences that don&#x27;t matter over very large differences that do.  A difference in 0.01s vs 0.011s will appear just as large as (say) 0.1s vs. 1s, and that&#x27;s not helpful.  A logarithmic scale might be nice too.<p>3. JSperf&#x27;s semantics are surprising enough to cause bugs.  For instance, the benchmark setup/teardown aren&#x27;t called for every test, nor are they merely called before the first and after the last test - but something utterly useless in between.  Tests aren&#x27;t isolated from each other, so cruft left from one test can impact a later test easily. Actually, tests are run in the jsperf document itself, so trivial stuff like how many comments or versions a benchmark has could conceivably impact DOM performance.<p>It can still be a useful tool - but be aware that most jsperfs out there are quite misleading because they don&#x27;t test what they claim.",1400531372

The short of it is that it never really worked out well. I brought in leads, but nothing closed.  A number of reasons made this unsuccessful namely 1) trying a new sales strategy while also trying remote work and 2) no time from leadership<p>Last week my boss told me things weren&#x27;t working out.  I could resign and &quot;save face&quot; with the team. I could be &quot;let go&quot; and claim unemployment. Or, I could continue working for the company, but on a commission only basis (so presumably a higher commission, but no salary.. ergo I take on the risk but with the opportunity for higher rewards).<p>I&#x27;m torn as to what to do. I still have a great relationship with the boss and my teammates so &quot;saving face&quot; has some appeal.  But i&#x27;ll also be out of work in two weeks and am considering unemployment.

I&#x27;m also not sure that working commission only will be in my best interest, given the rate of success that has been evident over the past months.<p>So, my questions to HN are:\n1) which of the 3 choices should I take?\n2) If I take unemployment, will that affect my job search process negatively?\n3) i&#x27;ve been there for 4 years, should I be expecting a severance package of some sort?",1400531299

Perhaps in the future we might make it easier for others to discover what maps there are from the homepage.<p>SHP exports: Correct, the SHP exports from v1 maps will only have a plots.shp file and no trees.shp file. However, if you open that file in Esri ArcMap or the open source QGIS, you&#x27;ll find that the tree data does exist, it&#x27;s just in a second &quot;attribute table&quot;. The way OpenTreeMap is architected, we have two data concepts: plots or &quot;planting sites&quot;, and trees. A particular plot has the latitude/longitude location associated with it, and a particular tree is associated with a particular plot (but the tree doesn&#x27;t have a location, itself). This allows us to keep track of the history of a particular plot/planting site - which may host multiple trees over the years as they grow, die, or are cut down.

7769507,comment,7765758,7768096,2,0,EvanAnderson,,,"The position that an owner of a computer should be obligated to cede control of their computer to third-parties seems more ethically dubious to me than the position that they should not. I am certainly proud to make the argument that the owner of a computer should control its operation.<p>I would argue that terms-of-service &quot;agreements&quot; which assume I will cede control of my computer to a third-party are immoral. I find it offensive that anyone would argue that it&#x27;s alright for others to tell me what I can do with my computer. I wish more people would take a stand against attempts to control how owners of computers use their devices. We might not have gotten ugly legislative constructs (like the DMCA in the US) if people had cared more about their rights.<p>The &quot;essence&quot; of my argument is this: Private owners get to control their computers (at least right now). It is a false reality to think things are different.<p>I don&#x27;t think your analogies about unlawful detention of persons, theft of scarce physical goods, and some kind of victim-blaming rape accusation follow at all. I certainly can&#x27;t formulate how to respond to these non sequiturs. Code executing inside a computer has very little to do with kidnapping, theft, or rape. I certainly don&#x27;t see any of them as even remotely equivalent or analogous.<p>I might have made an argument about the &quot;morality&quot; of skipping commercials using digital video recorders (DVRs), which seems a lot closer to analogizing altering how a web site displays on my computer. Television producers are learning that owners of DVRs skip commercials and, rather than (for the most part) making arguments about taking away the rights of owners of DVRs, are moving to other business models (like product placement).<p>Rather than assuming my computer will display their Customers&#x27; ads (or doing odious things like trying to get laws passed to make private ownership of general purpose computers illegal) I&#x27;d rather see website operators move to new business models. If that means that some &quot;free&quot; services disappear then so be it. If a service can&#x27;t finance itself by having its users be its Customers then I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s probably a pretty good chance we&#x27;re better off without it.<p>(I do find it exceedingly amusing that you admit to using AdBlock yet make the argument you do. I haven&#x27;t ever used any advertisement blocking software. I simply eschew services that I find inundate me with advertising, or just &quot;look around&quot; the ads when a service is compelling enough to use.)",1400530383

There are lots of articles on engineers who prefer engineering more than managing.<p>Not what you&#x27;re asking for, but you have a pretty strong hand to play right now. If you went to the CEO and listed the issues that you&#x27;re dealing with that you would expect the CTO to deal with.<p>Then say, &quot;These are basically executive-level functions. I&#x27;m happy to handle them, but if you aren&#x27;t planning on hiring a CTO, I&#x27;d like the title of VP Engineering and another 20% raise.&quot;",1400529838

Obviously there are no comments and labels, but the actual <i>logic</i> and the intent of the original developer is clearly communicated.<p>This allows for a really special type of awesome when you&#x27;re working on fan translations and ROM hacks. You actually have the opportunity to analyze the work of the developers you idolized when you were younger, and celebrate a their clever hacks or curse them for their spaghetti code, 15 to 25 years later. Furthermore, you can contribute your own clever hacks to the code base.",1400529740

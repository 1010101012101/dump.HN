I have put several brands under one LLC, and then used the 'class' feature in Quickbooks to give each brand each its own P&L. I keep my building in a separate LLC from the rest to protect it. I feel there is enough liability in owning a business with slip/fall type lawsuits to segment the assets, since we deal with the public (non-tech business).<p>The ability to separate the financials with 'class' was the most useful part. Split LLCs force you to do this because they by definition needs their own P&Ls, but make it hard to figure out what to bill for each business. For example you may have an accounting expense - which LLC do you bill it to? Split evenly amongst the apps, or proportionate to what each earns?<p>If you have one LLC with many brands, if you want to sell one off then the 'class' segregation will let you show a potential buyer how profitable it is by itself.<p>notes: I am only familiar with QB, I am sure other software does similar functions",1307238590

2620989,comment,2619417,2620679,14,0,nostrademons,,,"If you're comparing to Python (which is stable but hella slow) or Ruby (which tends to be both unstable <i>and</i> slow), GHC stacks up pretty well.  By ""production systems"", I was mostly referring to the sort of things that are normally written in Java or C++ - Google-scale server farms, or financial transaction systems.<p>You really want predictable execution behavior in those systems.  You want to be able to look at a graph of runtime parameters - memory usage, or server load, or QPS, or 95th percentile latency - and see that it's stable, and not have surprises like a massive spike that then shows up as user-visible outages.  Because getting paged really, really sucks, and losing money because your customers can't access the system sucks even more.  ""Kill and restart the process every now and then"" is not robustness.<p>If your intention is to play around with some prototypes and see what you can build, Haskell on the backend and Python on the frontend is a fine choice.  Your biggest issue (other than the learning curve of Haskell) will be finding libraries that you can leverage, and Haskell has one of the nicest C FFIs out there.  Other than that, here're assorted other little annoyances I've run into.<p>1. Positional data structures (tuples, ""naked"" [non-record, no accessor] ADTs, functions with long parameter lists) really suck.  You <i>will</i> eventually want to stick another bit of data in there, and then you have to update all the usage sites with new pattern bindings.  As immature as the record system is, take the time to use it from the beginning; it'll save you pain later on.<p>This is a very common pattern in C++ as well; many experienced API designers I know will give all their methods the signature of ""bool someMethod(const MethodInput& input, MethodOutput* output)"", where MethodInput and MethodOutput are structs.  At Google, we often use protobufs as the structs; that gives you a bunch of other benefits, as you can instantly print them out for debugging, and you can log them efficiently, and it becomes trivial to turn the API into an RPC service if it outgrows a single process.<p>2. Don't be afraid to use type inference; oftentimes, the compiler can infer a more general type than you can write down.  If you do write down the types, be liberal with your use of type synonyms; you will probably end up changing those types later, and it sucks to have to visit a few dozen functions with a search & replace.  ""newtype"" is very often worth it, if just for the added typechecking.<p>3. Point-free style is cool, but I've never been able to look at point-free code I wrote a month ago and understand what it was doing.  Don't do this outside of very specific cases where the point-free version has some semantic meaning (for example, you're treating a partially-applied function as an object that does something.  If you wouldn't define a closure for it in Python or JavaScript, don't make it point-free in Haskell).<p>4. Haskell module patterns are much more similar to C than C++ or Java.  You typically want a clear divide between ""data"" modules (that define fundamental dataypes) and ""code"" modules (which define functions and algorithms acting on those datatypes).  Trying to use the OOP-style, ""one class per file"" approach is very frustrating in Haskell.<p>5. The ""mathematician's naming convention"" (all single-character variable names, with ""s"" as a plural to indicate a list) is just as bad an idea in Haskell as it is in C.  Go give your variables some meaningful names and ignore all the tutorials that have ""xs"" and ""ps"" and ""qs"".<p>6. Very often, you'll want to define a monad for your code from the get-go (you can even just typedef the IdentityMonad to start out with) and write your code in a monadic style from the beginning.  You <i>will</i> want to add error-handling and probably state and logging at some point in the future.  If you start out with a typedef'd monad type, you can just change the typedef to some monad transformer stack as you need to.",1307237231

My main problem is lack of intrinsic motivation to create stuff, in the widest sense. For example, I don't contribute to open source projects. I don't have any own programming projects. I don't have a personal web site or a blog. I'm not a member of a political party trying to change the world. I find the start-up scene thrilling, but as long as I don't change, I will probably never be part of it.<p>I think the underlying problem is that it's quite easy for me to find things that interest me, but very hard not to get bored after a day. For example, think about topics like lock picking, composing electronic music, web development, functional programming languages, [insert random technology here], etc.<p>As soon as I understand the basics of X, I lose interest. After I had managed to open a very simple lock, I stopped practicing. After I had roughly figured out what the knobs on a synthesizer do, I stopped trying to make electronic music. After I understood which technologies are required to build and deploy a modern web site and how to get a basic ""hello world"" running, I stopped building web sites. After a few hours of ""Learn you a Haskell for Great Good"" and seeing the main differences to other programming paradigms, I stopped reading (same for the Erlang equivalent). I've had a look at so many different programming languages in my life, but after I understand syntax and basic design principles, I lose the motivation to actually build something with it.<p>As such, I have no chance to become an expert in a particular field. It's frustrating.<p>I perform very well at university, though. It's easy to see what you have to do to get the reward (a good grade), so I do just that. Actually, (graded) university projects are the only projects I've finished in my life. Why do I need grades to motivate me? What the fuck does optimizing for good grades matter, while others actually do and learn useful stuff in their free time?\nWhy don't I feel the urge to build kick-ass stuff, while so many people here do? Why can't I stay focussed on a single thing without external pressure (grades)? I'm close to graduation now. I could know far more than I do, if I had learned past what is required for getting an A.<p>Something needs to change. I already see myself decaying at $BIG-CO, the monthly pay-check as my only reward. But what other option is there, without any passion.<p>PS: HN is very inspiring for me, though. My brain loves the rush of information. It's typical for me to open 40-something tabs of news stories, just to skim through them, without reading a single one in detail: Read the introduction, read the conclusion, close tab, read top HN comments. Understand what it is about and what smart people think about the subject. Then go to next story, repeat. Maybe it's ADHD. Medication (stimulants) did not really help, though.",1307236877

As a guest, it's a privilege to be here.<p>But I have a very simple rule about websites: the site should do things that I naturally expect. If I provide a credit card, I don't expect that credit card to be used for other purchases. If I provide an email, I don't expect to be spammed. If I cancel a membership, I don't expect to be able to access the site.<p>And if I provide a comment that appears to be legit, I expect other people to be able to read it. When I vote something up, I expect that vote to make a difference. In short, if you provide what appears to be a way of communicating with others, it had damn well be a way of communicating.<p>When website owners violate that standard of fairness, sorry to say, I find it unethical. They are presenting me with a picture of the world that they know not to be true. Not as bad as using my credit card to make other purchases, but bad.<p>The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" argument is fundamentally flawed. It's the obnoxious protester who turns out to be right every now and then. It's the guy pleading for an unpopular cause that manages to sway public opinion. In short, we desperately need diversity of opinion and manners.<p>What happens is, people change and sites no longer serve them. Whatever the <i>intent</i> of the ""feature"", the effect seems to be preventing folks from changing. To enforce group homogeneity.<p>Like I said, I'm happy to be here and follow whatever rules there are. But this hellbanning shit is way fucked up. I don't care how many millions of users you have, screwing over folks for the greater good -- and lying to their face about it -- isn't a good thing at all.<p>How many hours of people's lives do you get to rob them of, pretending to let them publicly comment, before it's a bad thing? 10? 100? 1000? If a thousand people were actively commenting and nobody could read them, where do they go to get that part of their life back? Who says it's okay to lie like that? Just because you are a guest in somebody's house, they should treat you this way? I don't think so.<p>We act as if people are simply cogs in some great machine, the machine of the site. Not precious humans.<p>My opinion, for what it's worth. A bit over the top and theatrical, sure, but I exaggerate to make a point. Hopefully folks are able to read and understand it. There's no bright line between ""I hellbanned this guy for being that .01% of folks who are impossible to deal with"" and ""I didn't like Joe, so let's just let him think he's contributing"" You start down this road, there is no turning off. It's either acceptable or not. To me it's not.<p>These are tough problems, yes. But simply because you have something that works doesn't mean that it is the right thing to do. EDIT: Note slowbanning is fine. Nobody says you have to have a <i>responsive</i> site, just an honest one.",1307236242

So you may end up working about 70-80 hours per week.<p>The problem is that when applying for, or even transferring,  an H-1B the petitioning employer has to show revenue or existing capital and they also ask you if you have any ownership in the company. I am not sure what the impact of putting 'yes' in the ownership column would mean; likely a request for evidence.<p>Consult a good lawyer to guesstimate your chance of getting an H1 sponsored by your new company. If the odds are good (ideally, preexisting success cases) I would apply for a whole new H1 (not a transfer). If for some reason you do not get it, you are not out of status. If you do get it, turn in your resignation at the existing place. Make sure you work for the required number of hours for both parties during your transition period (2 weeks or whatever).",1307235843

This one looks left over from a prototype.<p>I like the icon in the Pages I am following block, the one that has P^2. You should use that as your favicon.<p>Changing the profile image: When I click on Change the first time, the word ""Change"" is obscured, but nothing happens. I have to click in the area where the word was a second time to get the upload dialog to pop up. If I then cancel without uploading the word Change remains obscured (no surprise). Hard reloading brings the word back. If I cancel the upload and click in the obscured area again (without the hard reload), the dialog comes up with one click. Hard reload, click, and you have to click again to get the dialog.<p>After I uploaded a picture it doesn't show on my profile, even after a hard reload. Also doesn't show after I log out and log in. Did the upload fail or does this feature not work? No way to know. I did see ""file uploading"" after trying to upload.<p><i>/create-a-page.php</i><p>Same result when trying to upload an image.<p>Input News and Updates below: I entered a title. It seems like the big block below the title is for adding detail to the news item, but I can't type in it. I can tab to it from the news title field and the block is highlighted as active, but I can't do anything with it.<p>After I submit I can see the new page in Your Pages. There's a white square next to the page's title, where I assume the image that I uploaded should be displayed.<p>When I click on the page I created, under Your Pages, it brings me back to create-a-page.php?edit=262. I see the page I just created, AND I see ""If you see a page you've previously created, that means you never clicked submit when you edited that page."" Except I DID click submit, otherwise it wouldn't have shown up under Your Pages on my profile.

Did that, and there's the Invite button. Clicked it. Invited myself.

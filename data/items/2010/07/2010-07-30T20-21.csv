Do the initial DNS configuration (Google Apps' help will tell you what to change).  This will also give them separate, Gmail-backed email accounts.  The free version currently offers up to 50 accounts.  There is also a non-profit version that adds some Premier level features.  I haven't looked into how one qualifies, but it probably involves significant documentation of one's non-profit status.<p>Note:  ""Powered by Google"" appears at the bottom of the page, in the free version -- removable at the Premier level.  Also, site design is limited particularly in overall page layout, but there are good options/settings and if you are interested in function over form, and free but robust, it's worth a look.  The one limitation is space; for most small organizations it should be plenty, but if you are going to load up with bulky content and/or video, you may want to look elsewhere or be sure to qualify for the non-profit Premier version.",1280523561

It seems to me that if merely swapping one set of machines out from a data center near the exchange and moving a few miles away is going to drastically change how that it performs, something is wrong.<p>From my personal experience, a brilliant friend of mine left his job at some Silicon Valley startup where he was definitely creating value for society to work at an HFT shop.  After a few months of working there, he calls me and we talk about some C++/algorithms stuff (I think he is much, much smarter than me, I just happened to have written a lot more C++ than he has) about how he needs to make his code run microseconds faster so that it can make more trades.<p>I am all in favor of people who change the world for the better being rewarded immensely.  I have no love for the iphone, but since many, many people do, I am sure Steve Jobs is worth his billions.  But for people getting rich doing HFT, the only return for society I see are some nebulous claims about liquidity.  Can the societal gains be quantified in some manner?  If every transaction on the exchange had an added latency of a microsecond, how would things change?  What if it was a millisecond?  What about a second?  How much worse off would the world be?",1280523219

1562578,comment,1560491,1560491,0,0,_delirium,,,"Another common issue he doesn't mention: using observed differences (or observed significance-test values) as the stopping criterion. The common statistical-significance tests <i>don't</i> work if the decision when to stop collecting data is dependent on the observed levels of significance. Instead, you must ahead of time decide how many trials to do, and stick to that decision, or use more complicated significance tests. (This is the ""multiple testing"" problem.)<p>For example, it works to flip two coins 50 times each, and then run a statistical-significance test. It does <i>not</i> work to flip two coins 50 times each, run a test; if no significance yet, continue to 100, then 150, etc. until you either find a significant difference or give up. That greatly increases the chance that you'll get a spurious significance, because your stopping is biased in favor of answering ""yes"": if you found a difference at 50, you don't go on to 100 (where maybe the difference would disappear again), but if you <i>didn't</i> find a difference at 50, you <i>do</i> go on to 100.<p>Put differently, it's using separate p-values for ""what is the chance I could've gotten this result in [50|100|150|...] trials with unweighted coins?"" to reject the null hypothesis each time, as if they were independent, but the null hypothesis for the entire series has to be the union, ""what is the chance I could've seen this result at <i>any</i> of the 50, 100, 150, or 200, ... stopping points with unweighted coins?"", which is higher. Yet that's exactly how many A/B tests are done: you start collecting data, and let the trials run until you find ""significant"" differences or give up.<p>(It's possible to set up a series of tests where you choose when to stop based on observed values, but you have to use different statistical machinery than the common significance-tests.)",1280523002

1562538,comment,1561757,1562360,0,0,andolanra,,,"I'm not entirely sure what you mean by ""using references for normally primitive variables."" Nonlocal doesn't change whether variables are references or not, only the semantics of assignment. By default, all assignments take place in the local scope; if you've indicated that a variable is nonlocal, then instead of creating a new variable in that scope you assign instead to the variable of that name in the nearest enclosing scope. All variables in Python are references to objects, so there is no such thing as a ""primitive"" type, but that was true even before the nonlocal keyword was introduced, so it's not relevant here.<p>Lisp has had proper support for lexical scoping and closures for ages, and nobody has ever accused it of being a leaky abstraction there, either. The Scheme example of the same program would be<p><pre><code>  (define (make-counter)
    (let ((n 0))
      (lambda ()
        (let ((temp n))
          (set! n (+ n 1))
          temp))))
</code></pre>
All that's happening here is that let is creating a new variable, and set! is looking for the nearest enclosing scope--which turns out to be the let--and assigning to that one. (Okay, there are minor semantic differences, because let creates a new scope instead of creating a new variable in the local scope, but that's not really relevant to the discussion at hand.)",1280522324

1562468,comment,1561757,1561757,0,0,lispm,,,"Unfortunately in the example there is not a single closure shown. A closure is a function and its bindings. But there are no function objects created.<p>What he shows is some attempt to describe some kind of lexical binding. But even that looks very suspicious.<p><pre><code>    def foo():
         global y
         x = 0
         def bar():
             print x, y
         bar()
         x = y = 1
         bar()
         x = y = 2
         bar()
         x = y = 3
         bar()
         x = y = 4
         bar()
         x = y = 5

    foo()

    0 0
    1 1
    2 2
    3 3
    4 4
</code></pre>
Above is really trivial. The problem is that the assignments change a variable and the function BAR sees the changes. So there is only one variable binding for X. In a variant where each assignments were really bindings, BAR would only see the binding in its scope and the number would not change.<p>Above would be in Lisp:<p><pre><code>    (defvar *y* 0)

    (defun foo ()
      (let ((x 0))
        (flet ((bar ()
                 (print (list x *y*))))
          (bar)
          (setf *y* 1 x *y*)
          (bar)
          (setf *y* 2 x *y*)
          (bar)
          (setf *y* 3 x *y*)
          (bar)
          (setf *y* 4 x *y*)
          (bar)
          (setf *y* 5 x *y*))))
</code></pre>
Again, no closure. Just a function with a local function that gets called several times.<p>He then describes that in a 'subfunction' a variable from an outside scope can't be set, but that is almost a side issue. It also may be that this is not often found in his code, but it is found in a lot of Lisp code that actually uses closures.<p>The most trivial example is a counter closure:<p><pre><code>    (let ((fn (let ((x 0))
                (lambda () (setf x (+ x 1))))))
       (print (funcall fn))
       (print (funcall fn))
       (print (funcall fn)))
</code></pre>
1 
2 
3<p>In above code FN gets bound to a closure. This closure is called three times. Each time it updates the variable X in its lexical scope.",1280521223

I'm working on some open source code for doing Wave-like stuff in a way that will be easy for people to integrate with other projects. Have you ever tried to edit a wiki page, only to discover that somebody else was editing it and had acquired a lock on the whole page? There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to both edit it, Etherpad-style. Or rather, the reason is that making something like that is <i>hard.</i> But it shouldn't have to be. I hope to have something release-worthy in about a month; right now I've got a distributed text editor prototype that looks like a cross between Etherpad and Notepad. It works, but the code needs an overhaul.<p>Another problem with Google Wave is that it's inherently centralized. They transform the insert/delete operations so they can be applied out of order and still converge on the same document state. Unfortunately, the method they use for this requires a central server to maintain causal ordering of the operations.

Also, the ones that stick around have gotten so good at working the political system and getting others to do their work that they can't fire them, because they will just say ""you didn't ask me to do it in writing"", or any number of other excuses why they didn't do their job.<p>Not to mention, let's say you do want to fire a programmer who can't program - you can't just fire them, they have to be given a verbal warning first, then a written warning, it needs to be documented with HR, then they are put on a 90 day probationary period, or ""improvement plan.""  They claim they don't have enough training for the job, so then they need to be retrained, at additional expense.<p>The other factor is that some managers like to keep 10-20% dead weight around because it pads their department.  Everyone is fighting for more direct reports; apparently whoever has the most employees wins some kind of management contest.  So, they keep 10-20% slackers on staff, knowing that if layoffs come around, they can cut the dead weight and keep the good programmers.<p>It's frankly amazing that anything gets done at all in a large corporation.",1280520030

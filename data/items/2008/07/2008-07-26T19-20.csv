Version 1.0 was written in PHP and version 2.0 is now Python/Django.<p>I need a way to get my user data from version 1.0 to 2.0. I can map the columns of 1.0 to Django model fields in 2.0 (or even the database itself if necessary).<p>I'm looking for a tool I can use to do this. Basically, I give it a list of maps like ""version1.mytable.foo"" maps to ""version2.mytable.bar"", hit ""run"", and it will transfer the information from one database to another based on the maps.<p>Extra points if it can do the reverse as well, in case something goes terribly wrong and we have to roll back to 1.0.<p>Any ideas?",1217102262

Pausch passed away today, July 25, after a brave struggle against pancreatic cancer.<p>Randy captured the minds and hearts of millions worldwide with his Carnegie Mellon
lecture, ""Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,"" and his book, ""The Last Lecture.""<p>Randy, who earned his doctorate from Carnegie Mellon in 1988, returned to the
university in 1997 as an associate professor of human-computer interaction and
computer science. Along with Carnegie Mellon Professor Don Marinelli, Randy was the
co-founder of the Entertainment Technology Center, a leading interactive multimedia
education and entertainment center.<p>At Carnegie Mellon, Randy was also the director of the Alice software project, a
revolutionary way to teach computer programming. The interactive Alice program
teaches computer programming by having kids make animated movies and games. A
fitting legacy to Randy's life and work, Alice may in the future help to reverse the
dramatic drop in the number of students majoring in computer science at colleges and
universities. Randy was also known as a pioneer in the development of virtual
reality, and he created the popular Building Virtual Worlds class.<p>An award-winning teacher and researcher, Randy was also a National Science
Foundation Presidential Young Investigator and a Lilly Foundation Teaching Fellow.
He used sabbatical leaves to work at Walt Disney Imagineering and Electronic Arts
(EA), and he consulted with Google Inc. on user interface design. He is the author
or co-author of five books and more than 70 articles.<p>Perhaps the greatest lesson, however, Randy taught us all was how to live, even in
the face of great challenges, and how to follow our passion. While Randy's greatest
passion was clearly his family, he did not shy from sharing his passion for his work
as a professor, for his students, and for Carnegie Mellon.  We will miss Randy, but
we will carry the memory of him and all that he did to make Carnegie Mellon a better
university and each of us who knew him a better person.<p>A memorial service for Randy will be scheduled at a later date.<p>Sincerely,<p>Jared L. Cohon",1217101520

I'm not sure what layers he's handling, but seems like he's at least abstracting the database away into some simpler calls. As long as he separates everything in a reasonable way, it could even help the stability of his program.
The part I don't quite understand is how it adds any significant amount of ""protection"" from his code being stolen. Programmers forced to stick to a documented API would be able to reverse engineer it, more or less. If he has a secret algorithm in  his secret sauce, it's possible that his workers wouldn't be able to duplicate it, but as he's not a passionate programmer, I have my doubts.
That said, it seems very closed to me, and I would feel a bit nervous working for him. But it's all just a perception from a single blog post, so I could be way off-base.",1217101013

It also seems that Danes are held in some regard internationally - so an explanation rooted in the Danish educational system is probably not much off.<p>The Danish scchool system doesn't only teach you answers, it also teaches you which questions to ask. Schoolkids are encouraged to come up with their own ideas and explanations - and to be able to argue their validity. This ingrains a different kind of knowledge: Instead of kids that are able to recite the periodic table you get kids that are able to explain why it is put together the way it is. I think this is the pivotal point.<p>I don't think Danish, or Finnish, kids are smarter per se, but they are better at holistic thinking, reasoning and abstract thought because they learn from a young age to ask interesting questions and demand coherent answers.",1217100959

257705,comment,257568,257568,0,0,sgrove,,,"This is a sensitive topic for me, since I'm in love with studying.
I have to disagree with a few points, namely that universities have developed into bureaucracies primarily seeking to further careers. I worked as an undergraduate researcher in a neuroscience lab, and although publication was always a pressure, I don't know anyone who wasn't there because they didn't want to be. Studying the same subject on such an exclusive basis for 5 years or more can cause burnout, but everyone in the lab came in excited at the possibilities of solving new problems.
However, universities can do more to ensure that their work helps the community directly - big research needs to continue unabated, or perhaps even on an accelerated schedule, but students and many professors can shift their focus from class-centric papers and projects to community-based projects.
Actually, this is the startup I'm working on right now, and it came about because students ""do not want to churn out meaningless solutions to irrelevant problems"", they want to do meaningful things.",1217099204

257703,comment,257588,257622,0,0,riahi,,,"I went to a Montessori school from pre-k to 5th grade.  The school I went to was just completely different from any public elementary school I have visited in this country.<p>Instead of a one-size-fits-all mentality for education, each teacher developed a work-plan for each student that he/she was to complete at the end of the week.  There were no desks, but workmats that we could arrange on the floor or at a table.  Everything we did had to be kept on the workmat, but allowed for freedom of working wherever in the classroom.  There were 9 week assessments which determined our progress and helped establish the pacing of our work-plans.  Almost everything was independent.  Teachers only taught in small groups of similarly leveled students, but this was maybe twice a week.  They seemed to serve more as facilitators of learning, not leaders.<p>A similarity to this article was that second/third languages started early.  I went to Montessori only speaking Persian and a little English, but within 1 year I was also enrolled in Spanish, and 3 years later in French.  I have since forgotten the French--there are few to speak it with in Alabama, but I have retained decent fluency in Spanish.  We had little in the way of sports aside from PE, but we had art classes twice a week (visual arts once on tuesdays and musical arts on thursdays).  We also had computer training from a very early age; I remember being on the early internet waaaaay back in 1995 when I was 7.<p>Classes were interestingly set up as well.  In one classroom there were 3 grades of students with two teachers.  I think there were maybe 40 kids spread amongst the years.  We stayed with the same teacher for 3 year blocks.  My experiences were Pre-K and Kindergarten / First-Third Grades / Fourth-Sixth Grades.  Interaction and cooperative learning between both grade-level and skill-level was encouraged, with the idea that one could only master the material if you could teach it to someone else.<p>Any further questions?  I'll try to answer to the best of my ability.",1217099017

People who advocate conclusions for which the evidence is weak merely lead one away from the truth</i><p>I'm curious what was lame about the comment?<p>The evidence for the two main propositions is pretty overwhelming.  People of West African descent dominate short distance running at the highest levels.  For instance, in the past six olympics, all 48 male finalists in the 100 meter dash were of West African descent.  Likewise, the speed positions in football are dominated by African-Americans compared to the non-speed positions.<p>On the second proposition, for whatever the reason, black Americans of West African descent consistently score a standard deviation lower on IQ tests and IQ-like tests ( SAT, Armed Forces Qualifying Exam).  The American Psychological Association reports: ""The relatively low mean of the distribution of African-American intelligence test scores has been discussed for many years. Although studies using different tests and samples yield a range of results, the Black mean is typically about one standard deviation (about 15 points) below that of Whites (Loehlin et al, 1975; Jensen, 1980; Reynolds et al, 1987).""

If there is evidence controverting my view, or supporting another, I would be happy to hear it.",1217098862

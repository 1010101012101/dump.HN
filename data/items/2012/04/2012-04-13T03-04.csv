That would only be one component and not every feature makes the cut.<p>I really truly believe that some form of project management can and will replace email and it can become integrated into our lives like Facebook my biggest qualm with project management is the project part. People aren't always necessarily working on projects but we sure do work with groups and keeping track of what's going on in all those groups is tough. I haven't seen anything that does it the way I feel it should yet. I'm not talking socially either. I'm talking about a tool that'll let you see what your family is up to or what your church group is doing etc. Yeah, I just described Facebook but the difference will be in how it lends itself to being used. Like if Facebook and Bascamp had a baby.",1334289438
3835332,comment,3835030,3835030,1,0,guynamedloren,,,"Interesting. I've thought about this very problem before.  In fact, I even started building a solution. Most of my emails, like the OPs, ended up as todos, so it makes sense to skip the email part. The idea is that you have buckets of todos, and other people can assign todos directly to you, at which point they show up in your bucket, etc.<p>The project never grew past MVP, but lately I've been using Asana and it seems to be very close to what I was envisioning.  I wonder if they're aiming to be an email replacement down the road.  I could certainly see it happening, and they're already on the right path.  There's no way they're planning on changing the world [1] with just a todo list app :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/11/facebook-co-founder-dustin-moskovitz-unveils-new-company-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/11/facebook-...</a><p>> ""We think it will be as impactful on the world as Facebook was."" - Dustin Moskovitz (fb/asana)",1334289436

It's hard to predict what the market will do in the face of the voting rights issue, though.<p>Berkshire Hathaway has a similar split between A and B stock, but they have an automated process in place to keep the prices in parity that involves converting A stock into B stock. They don't actually handle about the reverse, so B stock can indeed trade under parity. It's lower price (~1/30th of A stock, typically) means a greater demand, though, since relatively few people are buying A stock at $120k.",1334286991

3835254,comment,3797036,3801991,1,0,RollAHardSix,,,"I disagree. I recently designed and implemented virtualized image servers (real ones coming once the Requisition request comes through) for faster image serving. This was basically unheard of by anyone I work with however by having read the http specs I was able to give a report on why we wanted to serve images in parallel. It's easy to dismiss Web Developers as (X)HTML/CSS, Javascript & Php. In reality there are FAR, FAR, FAR more uses for programming competent Web Developers. Shoot, even having a good grasp of fundamental Computer Science helps with understanding Php's array's (or lack-thereof ;) ).<p>Now for practical usage? Sure Assembly is probably a waste of time. I still haven't found a real way to implement that wouldn't be. But the fundamental understanding of how a computer works, how decisions are made so close to the machine enhanced my understanding about programming which in turn enhanced my understanding about how I wanted to develop and engineer, even for the web.<p>My .02 cents anyway.",1334286852

Improving email is an AI problem not one which requires an email to contain more information.<p>One difficulty I see is that developing a system for intelligently processing email is not necessarily the sort of thing a startup can tackle - the required data set for testing and validation is too large for a small company to obtain naturally and test under real world conditions. It's the sort of problem that lends itself to an ""eat your own dogfood"" approach - and thus justifiable at an existing large company.<p>My gut tells me that outside the corporate world, this wants to be a desktop application, not a web based one. The intelligent engine needs to know about the files and documents on my computer to make better sense of the contents of a message - I don't want to have to share all that with a web service and I don't want to enter a bunch of metadata to create rules.<p>The software should know it's a bug report because I write a lot of code for the product, have other bug reports on my computer, and posted ten bug fixes to the code repository. not because I spent four days writing a CLIPS program to handle bug reports.<p>It's a nasty problem if one tries to just grep it into submission.

That is what they say, and it is inline with their religious texts.<p>Israel has never threatened to nuke anyone. It has stated that it is preparing for a potential MAD situation, but that's not a threat - it's a defensive move. Israel does not state that Iran has no right to exist or that its regime must be changed or anything of the sort. I don't think Iran can legitimately claim they have an existential fear of Israel and any attack on Israel is in their own defense. They proclaim Israel as their enemy _in the name of other Muslims_, because they are a big defender of Islam from the Western invaders, not because they are directly threatened.",1334286664

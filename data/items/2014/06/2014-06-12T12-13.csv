Not caring should mean not caring, dammit.<p>But as I read the article I realized that it&#x27;s really something else.<p>Requiring a user name and email means a trip to Epcot. It ain&#x27;t Europe. There are hyperlinks and pages and it looks like the internet. But it isn&#x27;t. The links will all be part of a sitemap. Registering is symptomatic of crabtraps: once in, the only way out is back the way I came in and usually what&#x27;s in the middle is pretty much a three day old fish head, which isn&#x27;t too bad if one is a crab, I imagine, but a fishhead in a cage is still pretty much a fishhead in a cage compared to the entire fucking ocean...even to a crabby bastard like me.<p>I&#x27;m the first to admit that there are a lot more smart people in the world than I tend to imagine, but the odds that I want to spend time in someone&#x27;s crabtrap for a few bytes of the someone&#x27;s idea of the best fishhead ever are pretty low. I mean if I&#x27;m that bored, there&#x27;s YouTube and HN and Facebook and Twitter. And one of them doesn&#x27;t even require me to register...at least not yet.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you probably don&#x27;t want me as a customer anyway - requiring registration makes sense by filtering out people who might be harder to track.

7883081,comment,7882597,7882747,2,0,csixty4,,,"There were a lot of solutions to this in the early 2000s, the golden age of the digital identity ecosystem. I did my bachelor&#x27;s thesis on the issues faced by a solution that respected Cameron&#x27;s Laws of Identity in 2003, shortly before the whole scene died off.<p>There were simple, streamlined solutions for this a decade ago. Nobody used them and many of them died. Some still exist out there like zombies. I was shocked to see inames.net is still out there.<p>The example I usually bring up is Windows CardSpaces, which shipped with Windows as recently as Windows 7. It was easy for people to get conceptually. It was easy for site admins to implement. But it never went anywhere.<p>When I talked to people about identity solutions like this, there were problems on both ends. From the user side, an identity solution needed to solve an obvious problem and/or be easier than the status quo. For many users, the status quo is to give out personal information freely and use the same username/password everywhere. Anything that adds choices or variety to the process is too much friction for little perceived benefit. Even if the actual process is simpler (clicking a card) than the status quo (filling out a form), there&#x27;s a mental cost in adapting to something new.<p>For site owners, there was the added difficulty of educating and supporting users about the new identity solutions. But, the real biggie was that they&#x27;d lose the ability to collect & sell all that personal data. That can be more profitable than advertising, and it&#x27;s a revenue stream some sites can&#x27;t live without.",1402577937

This was a weekend project idea I wanted to play around with for awhile now, so I’m mostly just showing hn for general commentary.<p>So I wanted to build a facebook application that took all your friends profile pictures and built a composite image out of them the size of the facebook cover photo...so a montage of all your friends for your cover photo.  Turns out, facebook removed the friends list endpoint from their api a couple months ago.<p>So I opted instead to allow users to select their photo albums and then build a composite image out of the photos in those albums.  The user can also overlay custom text onto the their new cover photo.<p>A few random notes:<p>- The interesting part of this was getting the image sizes, rows and columns laid out correctly for any possible number of images.  I’m sure there are elegant ways to do this that I didn’t think of, but I was pretty happy with my solution and how it turned out.<p>- The php GD image processing library was very useful, but appears pretty slow when processing a lot of images.  Again, I’m sure there are more efficient ways to do this (like, not using PHP perhaps), but this does the job and made overlaying text very simple.  I’m not sure how well the server will hold up to multiple or many users using it at the same time, however.<p>All in all, a fun exercise.

Before Spotify, I basically only listened to music in my car, and then I just stuck the top 40 station on and dealt with the crap. Now, in 3 years on Spotify, I&#x27;ve listened to more than 10k distinct songs on 2.5k albums from 2k artists. I&#x27;ve gone from US top 40 to music from all around the world. In the last month, I have listened to artists from the US, Germany, Western Sahara, Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal, Belgium, Sierra Leone, Brazil, Turkey, Norway, India and China. I&#x27;ve listened to new releases and music from artists who have been dead for 60 years. I&#x27;ve curated numerous playlists for myself and others, and have become known as someone with broad and unusual tastes. I am constantly seeking out new and interesting music.

Strong safety guarantees sound very beneficial at first (&quot;safe&quot; <i>anything</i> in general tends to evoke that response), but as shocking as it may seem, a lot of the freedom we have today is a result of using &quot;unsafe&quot; languages like C: iOS jailbreaks, Android rooting, homebrew on game consoles, and many other examples of freeing one&#x27;s devices from restrictions imposed by the original manufacturer and giving control back to the user depend on this. These bugs and vulnerabilities, although they can be exploited maliciously, are in some ways like an escape hatch from the tyranny of corporate control. If strongly safe languages become the norm, all these would disappear and our computing experience become even more locked-down and restricted. The thought of them being used for DRM is scary (I remember reading an academic paper that suggeted this as one of their applications, and that&#x27;s one of the thing that provoked me into really starting to think about this.)

The rest is our modern interpretation of the test. It&#x27;s a fine interpretation that I don&#x27;t have a problem with, but it is an interpretation, not a criteria lifted from the paper.<p>In the article Kurzweil even says as much: <i>Turing was carefully imprecise in setting the rules for his test, and significant literature has been devoted to the subtleties of establishing the exact procedures for determining how to assess when the Turing test has been passed.</i><p>It is not made clear in the paper that the intention is for the human interrogator to be made aware of possible replacement. I myself know this is not the most popular interpretation, but it still makes sense as a Test, you just check if player C is wrong as often as before. Some research has shown that unaware people change their attitude and questions, while other research has shown that for some judges this doesn&#x27;t matter. Early Turing bots were tested under the interpretation that judges can be unaware. For sourcing on this see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test#Should_the_interrogator_know_about_the_computer.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test#Should_the_interrog...</a><p>I think one of the problems with the Test is that it was written by a mathematician and logician, while it touches on fundamental philosophical problems of consciousness and other minds. It may be valid in these pure domains of information theory, while it may be problematic in philosophy of mind. It is not sure where one ends and the other begins. Philosophers hone in on the ambiguities and omissions. They ask: &quot;Why would Turing omit this rule, while carefully stating other rules? Is this ommission significant? Does the outcome of the test change when we make people unaware?&quot; That is not bizarre, as much as it petty.<p>Another problem I see with the Test, and this may be controversial, but: Turing creates a test for intelligence and as the basis he takes the distinction between male and female. Then he replaces the male with a machine and asks us: if we lose our gender guessing game as often as before then machines can think. This assumes that Turing thought that he could distinguish males from females by questioning their intellect (as for small-talk both players could easily lie about that). Which at the time of the paper may have been realistic, but in modern times is not the case: If you have an adversarial male and a female who try to trick you, I don&#x27;t think I could make a distinction at all: My guess would be as good as random.",1402576932

Even in the summer, you get a lot of overcast days and misty rain. Summer mornings are <i>always</i> cool: 13 to 16 C (high 50s F). Summer afternoons are usually sunny and hot: 23 to 28 C (high 70s F). Some people hate the lack of a &quot;real&quot; summer, but having experienced enough 37+ C/humid days for one lifetime, I don&#x27;t take much out of that complaint.<p>Winters are mild, temperature-wise, but overcast. You&#x27;ll only get about 10-20 hours of sun per week in the winter. For the plus side, if you look outside in the winter and it &quot;looks&quot; nice, it probably is (nice meaning 8-12 C). (On the East Coast, sunny usually means sub-freezing.)<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;always&quot; raining but you&#x27;ll probably get some rain on 2/3 of the days. Of course, some of those days are mostly sunny and have a misty rain for half an hour in the morning, and some are uniformly overcast.<p>It depends on what you like. If you&#x27;re physically active, you might prefer it. (It&#x27;s never too hot, or too cold, to run or bike.) Seattle has about the same climate as Paris, but the perceptions are totally different. In Paris, it&#x27;s being compared to cloudier, colder places like Berlin and Warsaw, so it has the reputation of being a sunny, mild city. Seattle is being compared to San Francisco and Los Angeles so it has the reputation of being cold and cloudy. If you&#x27;re from the East Coast or Europe, you won&#x27;t mind it. I&#x27;ve heard plenty of Europeans move to Seattle and, because they&#x27;ve been told the weather is so dreadful, think they&#x27;ve won the lottery when they get what&#x27;s actually an average winter (mild temperatures, not much sun but some, light rain).<p><i>Would living (a few hours?) away right on the pacific coast be an improvement in climate?</i><p>It would be even rainier, and it&#x27;s the rain (not the temperatures) people complain about. However, if you go east, over the mountains, you get into a climate that&#x27;s quite dry. One thing to keep in mind about Seattle&#x27;s weather is that, if you want, you can drive 100 km and get winter sun in the desert, or drive into the mountains for snow and skiing. (Snow at sea level is rare in the Pac NW.) If you really don&#x27;t like the 5-6 days per week of overcast in the winter, you can escape it on the weekends. On the other hand, if you want an actual <i>bona fide</i> rainforest, you can get to that as well.",1402576379

There has been a HUGE amount of research on how dyslexic readers read and how that compares with how proficient readers read, in multiple languages across most developed countries and quite a few developing countries.<p>The most common type of dyslexia, by far, is a problem in the performance of the brain module called the &quot;visual letterbox area,&quot;[1] which matches features of the reader&#x27;s writing system (letters, letter combinations, &quot;phonetic&quot; elements of Chinese characters, or whatever) to phonological features of reader&#x27;s spoken language. Developmentally, dyslexia is nearly always preceded by poor &quot;phonological awareness&quot; in dealing with spoken language.[2] They way to help people with dyslexia read better and get through daily life better is systematic training in sound-symbol correspondences specific to the reader&#x27;s writing system,[3] which helps dyslexic readers improve the performance of their visual letterbox area through training.<p>Meanwhile, programmers improve by debugging and reviewing code with other programmers, which analogously helps programmers attend to the details that matter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fldoe.org/ese/pdf/phon9872.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fldoe.org/ese/pdf/phon9872.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.sedl.org/pubs/sedl-letter/v14n03/3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sedl.org/pubs/sedl-letter/v14n03/3.html</a><p><a href=""http://reading.uoregon.edu/big_ideas/pa/pa_what.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reading.uoregon.edu/big_ideas/pa/pa_what.php</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://dyslexia.yale.edu/Dyslexia_articleintro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dyslexia.yale.edu/Dyslexia_articleintro.html</a><p><a href=""http://dyslexia.yale.edu/book_Overcoming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dyslexia.yale.edu/book_Overcoming.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704307/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704307/</a>",1402575386

What if instead of making a website, you created an entirely mobile application?  My theory is that you could eliminate the need for creating accounts since most people only usually use one device.  You can still have all of the mechanics for inviting and creating teams, because that would be native to the system.  All you would need to do is store a UUID for each user.<p>There are a few drawbacks to this approach such as a user losing their device.  Essentially all of their history would be lost with it unless you used something like CloudKit to back the users info up.  The problem with an API like CloudKit is that it isn&#x27;t cross platform (yet).  A user with multiple devices could join the same game, but I don&#x27;t see how that would stop users with multiple emails from accomplishing the same thing.<p>Just something I was thinking about, but I do agree with not creating more accounts.

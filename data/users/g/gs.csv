gsaines,1857,"My name is George Saines, I&#x27;m 29 years old and have been reading HN several times a day since 2007. In fact, it was partially because of you folks that my two friends and I formed a startup in 2008. Three rounds of funding, innumerable mistakes, and 5 years later, we started our second venture http://www.codecombat.com and got accepted to to the YC W14 batch on stage at Startup School 2013.<p>I stopped working on CodeCombat in early 2015 and am working at a real estate startup in SF.<p>Personally, I enjoy downhill skiing, talking about cars and computers, working with my hands, blogging, and music videos. Although I wasn&#x27;t a computer science major, I&#x27;ve built two products from the ground up with the help of my two cofounders. I&#x27;m a terrible runner, but I could run a 5k this afternoon, and I have no interest in alcoholic beverages. If you&#x27;d like to drop me a line you can do so at my personal email gsaines at gmail.com",1187623823,1450207814

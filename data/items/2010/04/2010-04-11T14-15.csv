It appears to be an HTC phone similar to the T-Mobile  myTouch.  It may be the best longterm solution as you can update the OS with Google Images.<p>The issue with android is that there are 4 separate versions of it in the wild: 1.5, 1.6, 2.0, and 2.1. If you want your app to have the widest penetration, you need to target 1.5 or 1.6<p>The moto cliq (one of the the T-Mobile phones) are stuck at 1.5 and haven't been updated to 1.6 or 2.0 yet. The G1 will likely never be able to update to 2.x (too small of on board flash space on the phone).<p>I've settled on a myTouch from t-mobile as my dev platform as it has 1.6 on it (which was required to run Appcelerator's Titanium). It may get returned for a cliq if they release an upgrade or any 2.x phone that comes out this month while I'm in the 30 day return period which all cells have in the US when bought without contract subsidy, or perhaps even the dev phone.<p>The Droid has a 2.x series android release on it.<p>Do not ask the people in the store, they're clueless about what version is on a particular phone. You can see it in the about menu on many of the phones if you dig in the floor models.<p>The android phones are <i>not</i> user updateable a la the iPhone.

This is just a fact that is difficult to degrade organic components without water, oxygen and some organisms like fungi, bacteria or earthworms.<p>This could have been a better experiment if they used a real composting technique to evaluate the time to degrade and being transformed into compost.<p>The McDonald's Happy Meal (without the packaging) can be crushed/mixed into small parts. A similar burger (made from fresh/untransformed food) could have been used as a comparison. As the composting takes some times (depending of the oxygen concentration, temperature or the biological activity), the Happy Meal and the reference could be split into 4 equal parts. Those 2*4 parts would have been put at different place inside an active compost (from bottom to top as the type of biological activity is different). Every 2 weeks (or every month depending of the activity level) a sample is taken to confirm the level of degradation. It's not full proof but that could already provide a ground for comparison.<p>By the way, Is McDonald composting their unused food? or something else? we never know.",1270997826

1256939,comment,1256827,1256827,0,0,chasingsparks,,,"It might work; it's a good experiment; but it's dangerous. I'd lean in favor of the Deci argument against ""cheapening"" the reward system for learning. The author seems to disagree. He closes with:<p><pre><code>   I ask her about the psychologists' argument that she 
   should work hard for the love of learning, not for 
   short-term rewards. ""Honestly?"" she asks. 
   ""Yes, honestly,"" I say. She looks me dead in the eye. 
   ""We're kids. Let's be realistic.""
</code></pre>
I think that it is a bad closing. No matter how intelligent you are, there is something that challenges you that you find rewarding -- sports, math, BMX, etc. The problem with education -- pointed out by the iceland article from earlier this week that I can't find -- might be that children are not given appropriate challenges. Incremental advancement by grades seems ugly and woefully imprecise. Some students are learning far behind their levels; some, far ahead. the former students learn to hate learning; the latter are bored.<p>So again, good experiment, but cause for concern. I'd be more interested in experiments that educate kids by intellectual level, not years in the school system. (Although, admittedly, parents are the obstacle. ""What?! Billy's not in the highest class?!"")",1270997692

Adding layers of abstraction that only serve the developer, rather than the phone's owner, is hard to justify on small, battery-powered devices.

I love Categories and Protocols. NsNotificationCenter is beautiful. Cocoa is design patterns in real-life. Instruments is amazing. IB doesn't suck as much - it's good for some views. Cocoa/Objective-C are so well designed that I have been struggling with an impedance mismatch when going back to Java/Flex and most importantly, Windows and 'Not Responding'. I can understand why Unity3D and MonoTouch.Net make things easier for developers.

Of course, when the host and guest CPUs are the same, you end up running bulk of the original native code pretty much as-is. But because you're dynamically generating the code, you end up causing a trap to the hypervisor for the corner cases.<p>The VirtualBox article is not clear on what it does when hardware supports virtualization (Intel VT-x (""Vanderpool"") and AMD-V (SVM) support) but I am guessing it also does what QEMU does, which is to use KVM (or whatever the equivalent is on other platforms than Linux).<p>What these extensions do is eliminate dynamic binary translation completely. You only trap to the hypervisor on PIO and MMIO accesses and few other minor cases. But all this is controlled by hardware and KVM kernel subsystem and the hypervisor itself doesn't touch the guest instruction stream.<p>[ Disclaimer: I'm not that familiar with KVM internals so the above explanation is probably a slight over-generalization. ]",1270995846

To do that, you need people with good business heads, proven experience, relationships and yes, money.   This is typically why first timers are so protective of their ideas where those with a bit of experience realize that there is more value in sharing the idea than there is risk in someone else taking it and running with it.  (see comment by mkeblx.) Again, because the idea is not the most important thing, execution is what is important.<p>Take the computer mouse for example. Doug Engelbart came up with the idea 20 years before it ever came into mainstream use.  Engineers and technologists like us seem to inherently believe that good ideas will naturally rise to the top, when really what often makes ideas reach the top has to do more with timing, marketing, and the confluence of many other events that are ancillary to the idea. Was VHS better than Beta? Was Windows better than Apple? Was Word better than WordPerfect?<p>So, as others have recommended, get some partners. Get other people as excited and passionate about the idea as you are, don’t worry about who gets the credit, and you will accomplish amazing things.<p>And, how much start-up capital do you need?",1270995724

It sounds like the author believes that everyone who disagrees with Apple's latest moves are brainless Adobe fanboys.  I believe most developers (myself included) disagree with the ability to control the method of development rather than the output (review process).  It also seems that Apple waited this long on purpose (days before CS5 release) - almost trying to screw Adobe over as much as possible.  This screwed over countless developers.",1270995536

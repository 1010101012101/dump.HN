I also find it useful to draw lines-and-boxes sometimes, but it's much faster and more creative if you don't constrain yourself to a standard like UML.  The only reason to use UML in this case is if you intend to use your diagrams as a communication tool rather than just a thinking tool.<p>But, as a single founder, you should have no need to communicate the kind of information conveyed by a UML diagram.  If you require that much hand-holding, you're not ready to be a single founder.  Time is a very limited resource for a single founder, and if you're spending time discussing UML diagrams, where are you going to find time to talk to customers, create a good marketing pitch, and all the other things required to create a profitable company?",1276681682

A context is a named code block which can contain a number of tests, along with some common setup and teardown that's run for each test. Contexts can contain contexts, and tests in nested contexts get all the setup and teardown from their own context and its parent contexts, in the order you'd expect.<p>I've used nested contexts to achieve much the same sort of thing as Evan talks about here: high-coverage functional testing of a sequence of actions. They have the same advantage that the length of the test stays linear with the number of actions, although unlike Evan's callback-style tests, they didn't stop the test tree as soon as a step failed.",1276680817

1435112,comment,1434496,1434496,0,0,derefr,,,"What this post calls ""brightness,"" I call ""ingenuity""—the process of coming up with good ideas that didn't previously exist. It's not really something society calls for very often (other than in entrepreneurial or R&D positions.) It's also the thing that ""manhole cover questions"" test—so if you can't imagine a company asking you that sort of question, they probably aren't that interested in you for the ingenuity you command.<p>Rather, what <i>society</i> wants is ""intelligence""—the ability to iterate quickly on a problem, efficiently searching the space of solutions/ideas <i>you already have</i> to find one that is most likely to succeed. This is what is measured by IQ, and mostly comes from the ability to focus rationally on the search, instead of derailing oneself with biases or status-grabs. ""Knowledge workers"" are simply workers who rely on their intelligence. But look at the average knowledge worker, and you won't see much ""brightness.""<p>As a note to anyone who wants to be more ""bright"", because it <i>is</i> useful to <i>us</i> here at HN: ingenuity is formed by two skills—creativity, and critical thought. If they are developed in parallel (creativity by learning new facts to synthesize—usually by observation, but esp. from books, criticism by receiving quantitative feedback on the values of facts and beliefs—usually from conversation with peers, but esp. in school) ingenuity thrives; if one or the other races ahead, ingenuity stalls. Too much criticism, you get conformity and social anxiety; too little and you get arrogance, and an output resembling the aesthetic wasteland of 4chan's /b/. Take the middle way.",1276680677

Two examples come to mind from back when I still used my iPhone:<p>1. Undo. Who is ever going to discover this on their own? Every action you can perform on your iPhone (With the exceptions of volume adjustment, going to the home screen, and locking the screen) is done by interacting with the screen. The undo gesture is not only hard to discover by accident, but it's very context-sensitive, which means if you do it by accident, it may not do anything at all. This is basically the complete opposite of discoverability. His 'skill atoms' example should demonstrate why this is problematic - if you want the user to develop a skill on their own, it should be easy for them to discover the verb to trigger the action (press a button, tap an interesting thing) and easy to understand the results.<p>2. The home button. While it's convenient and useful, in many cases I would find that an application would discard my changes if I hit home to dismiss it, instead of saving them. The most common case where I ran into this was the alarm application: I'd create a new alarm, go into the subview to set up the alarm, and then hit home to dismiss it instead of hitting the little back button they shoved in the corner... and it would throw out my new alarm. While the home button is a good affordance, it is destructive - by using it incorrectly, the end-user may or may not lose work, which makes them wary of experimenting. (It's my understanding that Android has a similar issue, but I've yet to use an Android phone).<p>I could also harp on how the lack of multitasking increases the penalty for end-user mistakes, but people have already beaten that dead horse.<p>Just to be fair, here's a similar example from the Palm Pre:<p>In most Pre applications, to delete an object, you simply pop up the dialog to edit it, and hit a trashcan icon. Simple. However... in a few specific cases, somebody on their UX team decided it would be brilliant to require the use of a gesture to delete. There are zero on-screen cues to suggest that it's possible to perform this gesture, or that the gesture will do anything - so the uninitiated user will simply think 'how do I delete this?' and get frustrated (or, hopefully, look it up on Google). In these specific cases, you have to drag to the left or the right <i>on top of</i> the object you wish to delete, which magically reveals a hidden pair of buttons <i>under</i> the object: Delete and Cancel. Only then can you delete. Even worse, it's possible to botch the gesture - if you don't drag far enough, the phone ignores your gesture. Compared to the majority of the Pre's UI (which is light on punishment and encourages exploration), this is a huge design failure.",1276678928

5987147,comment,5986158,5986158,2,0,shanemhansen,,,"He has a valid point. There are certain types of workloads which don&#x27;t scale well on a single machine when writing pure python code. If your workloads happens to need to get more cpu performance out of a single machine in pure python and isn&#x27;t easily to parallelize using processes, python&#x27;s not the best choice. Personally I feel like go is good for this use case because I consider writing my own object lifecycle code a pita. Others will only use multithreaded c code, something I&#x27;m not eager to touch.<p>I do however feel the need to make a couple clarifications:<p>If you fork a process, you don&#x27;t necessarily duplicate memory. Yay for COW. Fork twice and you&#x27;ve got fanout with very little extra memory. Threading works fantastically for I/O. C libraries can release the GIL during processing. So if you have to do something computationally expensive, you can let another python thread run.<p>I rarely feel restricted by python, and when I do I usually find that other aspects make up for it. I find it makes a decent systems programming language (although not as good as C). The os library and the ctypes library give you the capability to do most (all?) system level tasks.<p>I tend to prefer go over python when library support isn&#x27;t an issue, but that&#x27;s more due to it&#x27;s type system and channel primitives. As someone who&#x27;s pushed python to it&#x27;s limits as a systems programming language I&#x27;m pretty comfortable dropping down to C isn&#x27;t <i>often</i> called for, and writing in java/scala isn&#x27;t ever required.",1372881536

5987138,comment,5985377,5985377,2,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"There&#x27;s a big pitfall that isn&#x27;t mentioned: the equity doesn&#x27;t grow in value, perceived or real.<p>Savvy and experienced employees will consider equity at an early-stage startup to be a lottery ticket. Most startups will never experience a liquidity event, and, on average, the windfall from liquidity events is relatively small. There are a number of things that <i>most</i> employees can&#x27;t effectively protect themselves against (dilution, liquidity preferences, etc.). None of this means that these employees won&#x27;t negotiate the equity package, but they won&#x27;t trade salary and benefits for equity either.<p>Many if not most employees, however, are not savvy or experienced. They hope and expect that their equity will grow significantly in value, and consider it a big part of their compensation package.
Some employees are so confident in the future value of the equity that they are willing to negotiate their salary down to &quot;maximize&quot; their equity, almost as if it was a cash equivalent.<p>As a result, equity has become an attractive retention tool for early-stage startups, and one that is <i>seemingly</i> cheaper than alternatives that require cash. And equity can be very effective so long as employees believe their equity has value, is growing enough in value and that the odds the equity will be liquid in a reasonable timeframe are good.<p>If and when that belief starts to fade, however, equity can become a significant source of low morale and employee attrition.",1372881486

5987136,comment,5979766,5983564,1,0,agentS,,,"> I think people tend to underestimate the amount of time they spend on problems...<p>Again, the implication is that people who use languages with looser type-systems than Haskell spend lots of time dealing with the problems that you mention. In my experience, that is not the case. You can claim that I&#x27;m underestimating the impact of such bugs if you&#x27;d like.<p>> When you implement a red-black-tree, do you not spend any time testing your invariants?<p>Testing is, as far as I can tell, the reason that these problems don&#x27;t come up. In the process of solving all of those problems I listed above, you tend to write a bunch of tests that exercise the same code that is run in production.<p>> It&#x27;s weird that you bring Twitter as an example, as they canned a dynamic language solution for a static language that is in many ways very similar to Haskell.<p>I assure you that this transition is far less complete than you might think, and even when complete, will have more Java than Scala. Note that both of these languages allow shared mutable data, both allow null pointers.<p>> They all fail to scale well, both performance-wise and maintenance-wise. Statically-typed systems scale far better along both of these axis.<p>Oh, I agree. Go is statically-typed. However, you&#x27;re advocating going even further along the spectrum, and I&#x27;m saying that going further brings diminishing returns, and starts costing you in terms of available engineers, and your productivity in writing code. I think Go occupies a good point along this spectrum, where I can write robust code without arguing with a compiler.",1372881482

5987130,comment,5986158,5986935,2,0,AnIrishDuck,,,"> For the event example, garbage collection is the tricky bit, not sharing. Sharing could be handled merely by writing C structs linearly to an array - it&#x27;s cleaning them up when the message is done being processed that&#x27;s the problem.<p>I agree; however, this problem could still be bootstrapped to each individual process&#x27;s GC. The parser sends the shared memory id to all worker processes, and the shared memory representation contains a reference counter. Each object decrements the reference counter in __del__; when the reference counter reaches zero, the memory is unmapped and reclaimed by the kernel. This would probably cause major fragmentation issues with small objects, so pooling might be necessary.<p>This sounds like a job that could be abstracted by a library.<p>> A shared memory hash table is a) tricky to do and b) would require repeated polling of the hash table by client processes. Or perhaps you&#x27;d need to write to the hash table all the clients who are listening to that future.<p>I won&#x27;t argue that shared memory hash tables (and concurrent data structures in general) are easy to implement. But that leads back to my original point; that kind of code should be in a library.<p>Admittedly, Python today lacks libraries providing concurrent data structures. And it lacks modules that handle concurrent memory management. That doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s something inherent in its design that prevents such libraries from existing.",1372881424

times it&#x27;s, i.e., &quot;confused&quot;, been correct!<p>Thanks for the feedback.<p>For the link to MSDN, checking my collection of such
Web pages, I downloaded that page on 3/15/2012 as
file number 739 from MSDN in my collection of
documentation for ASP.NET, TCP/IP, etc. of the 4000+
Web pages of documentation I have so far!<p>Reading some of that Web page again, it looks
complicated, more work to make use of their
<i>provider framework</i> than just write my own code.<p>For using my code for session state store, in a Web
page just write early in the execution of the Web
page code<p><pre><code>    result_code = SSS_retrieve( )
</code></pre>
make whatever use want of<p><pre><code>     Public users_session_state As New SPP_session
</code></pre>
for an instance of my class<p><pre><code>     SPP_session
</code></pre>
and near the end of the execution of the Web page
write<p><pre><code>    result_code = SSS_store( )
</code></pre>
Simple.<p>My code for making session state persistent enough,
still available anywhere in my server farm with no
issues about concurrency or locking, and nicely fast
is really simple:  So, the session state store is
just a little program in Visual Basic .NET
(apparently as good as anything else at making use
of the common language runtime, CLR, and .NET
Framework).<p>The program runs as just a console application
started just from a command line, actually from a
short scripting program (in ObjectRexx, my favorite
scripting language until I convert over to Power
Shell).<p>The program implements just a <i>key-value</i> store.  To
this program, each key is just an array of type
byte; similarly for each value.  The implementation
is just via an instance of a .NET collection class,
hopefully AVL trees or red-black trees.  There is a
second instance of that collection class used for
handling session time outs, as I recall, hard coded
at 40 minutes.  We&#x27;re taking simple, dirt simple,
here!<p>The program just listens on a dedicated (hard
coded!) IP port number for a connection request.
Since the program is single threaded, there are no
problems with concurrency or locking.  That is, the
program serves just one customer at a time!<p>From timings, on a single core, 3.0 GHz processor,
the program should be able to do the work needed for
a site to send 1000+ Web pages a second.  If my Web
site needs more capacity, then just do <i>sharding</i>,
that is, in the code for a Web page, given a session
ID, do a look up and find the IP address and port
number of the executing instance of the session
state store program that handles that session ID.<p>Keep 512 such instances busy, and could have a
really busy Web site!  With 16 threads and instances
per processor, that would be 32 processors which
would fit easily in just two standard racks.  A big
Web site and session state handled with just two
racks!  Nice!<p>Microsoft has a collection class in storage with
scope the &#x27;application&#x27;, i.e., all Web pages in one
instance of IIS, and I tried to use that storage for
my session state store.  The first bad news was that
during development something got confused raising an
exception &quot;invalid cast&quot;.  So each time I changed the
code for a Web page I had to issue Microsoft command<p><pre><code>     iisreset /restart
</code></pre>
to get everything working again.<p>It is true that my way of handling session state
makes my Web page code look different.<p>So far I&#x27;m happy with how I&#x27;m handling session
state.<p>Thanks for the detail on how the next GUID is
generated -- just add 1, which is less obscure than
I had hoped.<p>So, maybe for a GUID start with the MAC address of a
network adapter, use some time and/or date, and then
increment or some such.<p>If a malicious user wants to break into my site,
then they will have to guess both the GUID of the
session ID of a current user and also that user&#x27;s IP
address.  If that is not secure enough, then I can
just ask ASP.NET to encrypt the data in the hidden
field.  Then a malicious user would have to decrypt
to find a legal GUID, generate some trial GUIDs,
encrypt, guess an IP address, and post the data back
to my server.  And at that point, all they have
managed to do is to have my server send some
confused response to the IP address of the real user
with that session ID.  No biggie.  Besides, my Web
site is not for a bank or trading Bitcoins, etc.!<p>For &quot;crazy&quot;, it can look that way to others.  To me
I just saw an unsolved problem, turned it into a
math problem, got a math solution, and wrote some
code.  I believe that the problem is important and
my solution good.  We will see, at least see if
users like my solution.",1372880755

It&#x27;s silly to say the answer to doing parallel is to throw it on the GPU.<p>But referring to the IO side debate, the current design of many of the libraries that you call in the C world are often inheirtly blocking. &#x27;gethostname&#x27; for example is a blocking call. There is no async version of it. To use them without contention on your single threaded application, you have to call them from worker threads.<p>The common pattern is to spin up a thread to call it and do work on it. It&#x27;s easier often to have your workers be thread bound like that to simplify your code and only lock shared resources when you need them. I can also make a massively async version of all my code that handles everything using async methods and in many cases this is better but it&#x27;s harder to write and not always an option.

As a meta-machine, a machine that can embody and or imitate almost all other mediums, the computer offers a unique opportunity to augment and enhance the reach of humanity.<p>As the last few weeks have shown us, this reach can be extended in a negative fashion, and can be used to complicate the problems we already face.<p>But Doug Engelbart saw the other side of the coin, that the computer can be used to free and uplift us, and help us come together like never before. He saw this earlier than most and he pursued it further than most. And so we can follow along in his wake and add our efforts to his, and to the greater goal of extending humanity in a positive direction.<p>I&#x27;ll finish by encouraging everyone reading this to take a few minutes now, and perhaps every few days from here on out to think about what efforts we can each make towards furthering Dr. Engelbart&#x27;s ultimate goals.  Not in the spirit of guilt or of shame, but instead as an inspiration.  If one man, guided by a vision of using the computer to positively affect the course of human development, can accomplish this much in a few decades, how much further could we get with each of us working as well?

From the statement it sounds like they&#x27;re more worried about the existence of VPN services at all.<p>It doesn&#x27;t personally affect me, though, because just about anything you can do via a VPN you can do by buying a VPS and ssh -D&#x27;ing through it.

You loose CPU-bound parallelism with threading, but you gain easy to write C extensions (well, relatively speaking). I think this point is critical to the existence of something like NumPy (which is unrivalled in general PL AFAIK).<p>If you need to share a lot of data (a big numpy array), then you can use mmap arrays, there is no serializing/desarializing cost, and that&#x27;s efficient.

Facebook might be harder but it would be an interesting technical challenge to see what extent to which Facebook accounts could be stored encrypted on Facebook&#x27;s servers.

Case in point: there&#x27;s another thread today about the Post Office logging mail cover information for law enforcement, and people express surprise that this isn&#x27;t a violation of the 4th amendment. Within 5 minutes of looking, I found an <i>1878</i> case (Ex parte Jackson) articulating the view that the contents of the mails are protected (and require a warrant to open) but that the exterior information is not.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not an American and learned what I know about American law by reading it cold rather than growing up within a web of assumptions about it, but it seems obvious to me that 4th amendment protections are actually fairly narrow, because it allows for all sorts of <i>reasonable</i> searches and seizures.<p>The fact is that as Americans you don&#x27;t have a proper constitutional guarantee of privacy. You have a half-assed one that was semi-invented by a liberal court in the 1960s in what even liberal legal scholars consider to be an embarrassing example of judicial overreach - and this is why the right wing in America has never been able to accept <i>Roe v Wade</i>.

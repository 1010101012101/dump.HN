Change a piece of JS, and the UI definitely needs to ok it. Change a piece of the mid-tier, and you can bet your ass that it's vetted before it's comitted - often by additional developers that don't even work on the mid tier.<p>Granted, this was a corporate b2b app for a fairly large company. Everything needed to be vetted, and sometimes it splled delays (hey, can you do my code review so I can test on staging? Ok, in 15 minutes then..).<p>At my current position on a small team, we do optional weekly code reviews: do something interesting or that you want feedback on, bring it up in the weekly.<p>How do you make pre-commit vetting of code quality scale, especially on a low headcount, high velocity team?<p>Without impacting the weekly velocity numbers that people not involved in said code reviews are used to seeing?",1253498206

They can infect you, then can breed with other ideas, they spread, etc.<p>Religion world wide does seem to follow a pattern of more complicated and more energy demanding religions being replaced by religions which require less effort. One god instead of many, and lately that god doesn't even want sacrifices, oh and peace is better then war... most of the time.<p>Obviously it not that simple, religion can spread through war, some religions make themselves extinct by demanding life long celibacy from everyone. And there's been some studies which found the <i>us vs them</i> pattern common in religious groups can decrease and/or slow the spread of disease.<p>There's one particular thing about Christianity though. Well OK, a couple of things, one it's kind of a modern less complex flavor of Judaism, no offense meant to any Hebrews reading this.<p>But the other thing is Christ's rather extreme <i>love your enemies, turn the other cheek</i> message. You have to see that in the context of the Roman empire and Roman culture at the time.<p>Rome was EXTREMELY pro war, violence and punishment. Think crucifixion,  gladiators, pax romana etc. But even more then that, Roman culture saw mercy as a dirty animalistic emotion, to be surprised like all animalsitic and primitive urges should be. Reason was human, emotions, especially mercy were disgusting instincts not to be trusted, but to be fought against, with reason.<p>In short it was an extreme culture, that must have put some unique psychological pressures on those living there. Think how people in Japan who remember the end of WWII describe how the emperor announcing Japan's surrender felt like a bow breaking and huge pressure being relieved.<p>Christianity is like the perfect counter culture to the old Roman culture. No wonder it successfully spread throughout the empire. And from Rome to all of Europe, to the new world.<p>The other parts of the old world, have not turned Christian, and it's not for lack of trying by well funded Christian missionaries, suggesting there really was something unique about Rome and early Christianity.<p>Modern American Christianity is often quite, shall we say unique, why with the pro Gun, pro war thing.",1253495002

Also, we acquired a company which essentially wrote their own Asterisk for Tomcat and built the current incarnation of our PBX platform on that. We do SBC with OpenSIPS and there are a number of other random bits and pieces (including Asterisk) which have played a role over the years. I have not seen the other company's codebase, but I am told they are a similar hodgepodge of PHP, Erlang (but not for the telephony bits), and possibly Java.<p>I would rather enjoy and appreciate any consistency in the platform, but I doubt we'll ever get to do the sort of rewrite that would provide that consistency.",1317700660

The fact that you don't see the problem with this is evidence of the bias I mentioned.<p>> <i>Well, apparently, if my API is clean enough, then you shouldn't need API documentation. Right?</i><p>Sure.  In an ideal world, the API would be so obvious that further documentation is redundant.  That's often not realistic, though, so we have additional documentation to shore up the API.  (In modern code, the bulk of this is actually in comments inside the API interface.)<p>> <i>Regardless, a clean API can be self documenting, but having tests demonstrating all the forms and intents of the classes can help with precisely what to do. As for code being clear: What does code have to do with an API? The whole point is to avoid actually having to look at the implementation of the API.</i><p>So instead of looking at the API itself, it's more appropriate to look at unit tests?  It's better to look at 'testWiggleWidgetThrowsOnNull()' than to just look at the API and see that 'wiggleWidget()' throws on null?  Or better yet, look at the documentation that should state that null is not a valid argument?<p>Unit tests are not good documentation.  Good documentation is intended for <i>humans to read</i>.  Unit tests are intended to test code, not to convey information.  They generally contain a ton of noise in the form of boilerplate and mock objects.<p>> <i>These are two different issues entirely. One has nothing to do with the other. Regardless, documenting 25 hours doesn't change the fact that changing it requires testing. It's as simple as that.</i><p>Of course.  I've not argued against testing.  I don't believe unit tests are always appropriate, though, and I think the argument that they are documentation is really weak.<p>> <i>You seem to be playing straw man with your first argument, you're just confused with your second, and targeting something that has nothing to do with what we are discussing.</i><p>I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to as my ""first"" and ""second"" argument.  It's absolutely not a strawman to say that unit tests don't prove code correct.  It's a fallacious claim on your part to say that they do.  A unit test passing only proves that the code does what the unit test expects.  It doesn't prove that the unit test expects the right thing, nor does it prove that the code is being tested where it actually matters.<p>If the second argument is about documentation, I stand by my assertion that unit tests are not good documentation.  In fact, I would say that they are terrible documentation, for the reasons I outlined above.<p>> <i>It's like me bashing git because it doesn't compile your code.</i><p>Which would be a pretty reasonable response to someone claiming that git is a great compiler.",1317697603

1710480,comment,1710316,1710316,0,0,Isofarro,,,"I wonder if there are any examples of SproutCore being used in a decently progressively enhancing way. The last time I looked through, JavaScript disabled/unavailable view was an empty div.<p>Might be strange to pick up the lack of attention on progressive enhancement from a JavaScript library developer group, but take a look at what davglass is doing with YUI and node.js in terms of progressive enhancement (for example <a href=""http://ajaxian.com/archives/progressive-enhancement-using-nothing-but-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajaxian.com/archives/progressive-enhancement-using-no...</a> ). The ability to run the same javascript on the client and the server introduces a powerful new way to do progressive enhancement, this opens up possibilities of taking a very rich interactive application that works decently enough on a constrained platform/network (very much directly aimed at the Sprout Core ""we do web applications not websites so we don't have to bother about non-javascript"" philosophy at their original launch)<p>The ability to build upon what's already there is important. So a solid approach to progressive enhancment is necessary for any JavaScript library that wants to be anywhere near web developer mainstream.",1285016370

How much is too much?<p>4) Revenue concerns: the income of the rich is highly volatile, and so is the revenue of a country that depends on heavily progressive taxation.<p>5) Long term economic growth concerns: Capital is more mobile than ever, and people will prefer to invest in countries with lower taxes, ceteris paribus.<p>6) The Laffer Curve: it has an inflection point.<p>I'm not saying the anti-taxers are right, but any honest commentator should acknowledge that some arguments exist on the other side. But in Krugman's world, people only disagree with him because of personality flaws (angry, selfish, myopic, stupid, etc.). I can't stand the man's smug self-righteousness which he keeps regardless of how mainstream or controversial his opinion on the topic at hand. The man sold his soul to democratic socialism a long time ago to the point he pretends that no other valid worldview exists.<p>I can't think of a single economics columnist who is more partisan or who treats his opponents with less regard.<p>In particular, this article scans like a college newspaper op-ed. It is a simple Rah Rah piece for his side. It could have been written by a campus Marxist group. ""Look at the poor rich folks, struggling to pay for their private schools and limosines"". Gosh Mr. Krugman, with such incisive commentary I can see why you got that Nobel.<p>And of course he forgets to mention that most rich people vote Democrat, so his entire argument that the rich are ""angry"" is questionable to start with.",1285016243

If anything open source should have proven is that while there is a lot of valuable work to be done, no-one is willing to pay for it being done, especially not in the startup phase when it's not even clear what you are working on.

1710390,comment,1708413,1708413,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Your parents are lucky:  Apparently they have been able to continue for decades in salaried jobs.  Here is a bold, blunt fact of life for salaried jobs in the US economy:  Only a small fraction of such jobs can last for the 45 or so years of a working career.<p>Then, here's another problem:  A marriage with a working wife is not a very stable situation:  Apparently about 1/3rd of marriages end in divorce.  So, with the 2/3rds, the situation is already bad.  But there is more that is worse:  It is politically incorrect to note that a large fraction of women really are <i>house mice</i> and find anything in work outside a home surrounded with a white picket fence too stressful.  So, they need to be in a one income marriage (maybe do some <i>volunteer work</i> to <i>save the world</i>, whales, poor people in Africa, or some such), not a two income marriage.  Next, for a large fraction of women successful in the world of work, they conclude that they no longer <i>need a man to take care of them</i> and leave.  That your parents have two incomes and stayed married is also unusual.<p>Then there is another fact:  Quite broadly in the US economy, and nearly without exception for technical positions, the subordinate needs to be younger than the supervisor.  So, by age 45 or so, a large fraction of people have to be CEO or be unemployable.<p>So, net, for a stable career, need to be a CEO.  Exceptions?  Sure, MD, LLB, tenure in academics, and a few more.  DDS?  Typically they do own their own business.  MD?  Commonly they own their own business or are a partner in a partnership that owns a clinic.  Academic tenure?  They don't have to have their salary keep up with inflation.<p>Put more simply, the main path to financial security in the US economy is for someone to own their own business.  Mostly those are <i>Main Street</i> businesses; these businesses typically have a great advantage, a geographical barrier to entry which means if do well against competition in a radius of 100 miles then can do quite well.  Commonly another advantage is not just a few, niche customers but many customers drawn from quite broadly in the community so that, in economic ups and downs, if the community is not devastated, then the business still can continue.  In bad times, sure, roughly, first-cut, get less revenue but also pay less for supplies including labor and need less money for yourself.  Also, with many customers, usually one unhappy customer does not seriously hurt the business.  For owning your own business, technology might help; still, it is next to crucial to OWN your own business.<p>If get started owning your own business early in life, then that's an advantage.  If then can also use technology to become independently wealthy, even better.  Whatever, it's from important up to essential to own your own business.<p>Is this situation new?  Actually, yes:  Big businesses mostly don't have good geographical barriers to entry and, thus, in the US, growing over the past 40 years or so, have faced devastating competition from <i>globalization</i>.  So, maybe someone had a good career with GE before GE discovered that competitive products from Japan were selling in US retail for less than the cost of production at GE. Similarly for autos, steel, really most of old manufacturing, and more.<p>So, due to such global competition, we get some curious situations:  A Ph.D. in electronic engineering is essentially for a career with <i>global</i> competition while a licensed electrician in Poughkeepsie has no such competition.  So, a Ph.D. in electronic engineering can wish they could swap their Ph.D. for an electrician's license.",1285014555

</code></pre>
Into:<p><pre><code>  method(&obj, arg);
</code></pre>
Conceptually, if not literally. One of the design principles of C++, as stated by Stroustrup, is that you don't pay for what you don't use. So if your classes have no virtual functions and are not a part of an inheritance hierarchy, they should be just plain ol' data. C++ compilers will generate different implementations for different kinds of classes. When virtual members are involved, a C++ object is usually more than just plain ol' data.<p>But, even in such objects, consider:<p><pre><code>  class Circle: public Shape {
    virtual void draw();
    Point coords;
  };
</code></pre>
In this case, a Circle object will probably not be just POD because it will need to resolve draw() at runtime. But, a Point object will live somewhere in a Circle object - not just a pointer to a Point object. If you wanted that, then you would say:<p><pre><code>  class Circle: public Shape {
    virtual void draw();
    Point* coords;
  };

I thought that the original thread was about pointers eating up space.<p>My understanding is that C++ class definitions, because they themselves may contain function references...even just constructors/destructors and access methods, would represent the object with a pointer on the call stack to the location of the object (and all its data + method pointers) on the heap (which like you said could end up anywhere resulting in an irregular memory layout). Otherwise, suppose a class is defined as a collection of objects (which are defined as collections of objects on down etc.) some of which may of arbitrary length...ergo you'd never know how much memory to allocate <i>a priori</i> to hold these irregular data structured. Far easier to just allocate a bunch of word length pointers pointing to whatever random blobs of address space the OS gives back on malloc requests.<p>But yeah, if it's just POD then one would assume an easy optimization the compiler could make would be to just create the objects as contiguous blocks of object-sized memory.

If you change jobs it can be 4-6 weeks before your tax paperwork arrivse at your new employer, because it is sent from your old employer to the treasury from there to your new place of work; during this time you pay 'emergency tax' at the highest rate. Any overpayment is refunded as soon as the new employer has the tax information, but until they get it their payroll will cover themselves by withholding the maximum. This is not a fun thing when you begin working or change jobs, because for a month or so your employer is working on the assumption that you are fabulously wealthy until the Treasury gives them evidence to the contrary, regardless of how much your actual job pays. So everyone who enters/moves within the workforce is taxed like a bank CEO for the first month - something that's a lot more memorable than the refund which comes many weeks later.<p>Employer filing of payroll and income tax information each pay period would eliminate this archaic practice and make it easier for both employers to do payroll and employees to switch jobs, because the current tax information could be passed back to a new employer just as quickly, eliminating the wasteful (and expensive) disruption. They further suggest that if this worked out well, employers could upload gross pay information and have the treasury do the work of calculating the taxes, which would reduce employers' administrative overhead considerably as they would no longer be required to collect taxes and tax information on behalf of the government. It would also increase employees' financial privacy, since the Treasury would be storing the same information that it does now but it would no longer need to be duplicated in the recorrds of a person's employer for the purpose of calculcating their taxes.<p>It even states specifically: <i>At no stage would HMRC [the tax collection agency] or its agents have direct access to any money or information contained in the recipient’s bank account or indeed the bank account itself.</i><p>The notion that the money is proposed to go to the government first is simply Not True. It's a short document written in plain English. There is no way that CNBC could have interpreted it the way they did unless they are either stupid or dishonest. You've been had.",1285013374

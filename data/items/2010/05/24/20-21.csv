1375668,comment,1375416,1375416,0,0,jsz0,,,"Competing networks stunted the potential of Internet IM. At one point a few years ago I was connecting to half a dozen IM networks often to talk to one or two people per service. When SMS started to become widely used I think the effort of tracking someone down on these little IM islands just wasn't worth it anymore and text messaging reached a much larger audience of people who aren't tied to their computer 24x7. There are something like 25 billion text messages sent per year these days. That offsets the 8% decline in Internet IM and then some. So as usual the predictions were mostly right but instant messaging developed in a different direction than people expected.",1274734791

I already have a 4G read cache that's much faster, it's called main memory.<p>SSDs are nice for lots of random reads/writes; I noticed the biggest improvements on things like ""apt-get upgrade""; deleting files, reading tarballs, updating a database.  This is where SSDs excel, but the SSD that's part of this disk won't help with any of that.  When you download the tarball, it hits the magnetic disk.  Then when you extract that, you read from the disk, and write to the disk.  Then you read the package database... all from disk.  You update the package database... yup, disk write.  And so on; this drive will do nothing to help this use case.  Anything that could be cached will be invalidated by a write.  So you get no speedup on the only workload other than booting that helps a regular user.<p>If you're thinking of buying this, buy a regular disk instead, and save the $60 premium for a real SSD.

That's judgmental without any data to back it up. Poor people are likely poor because they aren't well educated, or have professional white collar jobs like you and I. Lack of education and access results in lack of awareness. You and I sit in our comfy sofas watching Jamie Oliver give a talk at TED and hence we hail our organic vegetables and our foo-foo healthy lifestyles. You cannot compare this vantage point with the predicament of someone who is struggling to make ends meet. Or someone who grew up in a poor neighborhood.<p>Lack of money has absolutely nothing to do with ""brightness"" or impulse control. I grew up in India and know all too well that poor people can be very sharp.<p>I have seen well-to-do fat people who lack even basic self-control. In fact, much of America is not poor and the obesity epidemic here has nothing to do with income levels. It is the result of a simple fact that fattening, processed stuff is widely available at every corner for dirt cheap prices. And that stuff that tastes good. When a healthy meal costs $12, it is but natural that someone who earns minimum wage goes for the $3 burger at McD.<p>To disprove your argument, I put forward one simple fact. Majority of the population in developing countries is not fat and they certainly aren't dancing around in money.<p>I would be interested in running an experiment. What if all organic, fresh, natural, unprocessed food was made dirt cheap and anything that isn't was taxed like hell? So a lb of fresh vegetables and fruits costs $0.50. Unprocessed food is subsidized at 50%. That order of fries, soda, and cheezburger? $15.<p>What effect would it have on society?",1274732610

The decision to lead a healthier lifestyle is often justified by health benefits, but the internal calculus is based on a desire to fit in and conform to social norms.<p>This matches my own life experience:  When I was poor, I didn't give a damn about what I ate or whether I exercised. I got fat.  As soon as I started making real money, I started paying more attention to these things, because everyone around me felt they were important and this rubbed off on me, and now I'm back to a healthy weight and not eating junk from a bodega.",1274732478

1375574,comment,1374749,1375219,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I don't, but then I have worked as a copy editor :)<p>The words were added by him, but functionally it sums up the point of the story extremely well: we associate art with creativity and inspiration, but leveraging that requires both teamwork and the confidence to trust your teammates. Many otherwise talented people fail in this area; I have, at times.<p>The version which ended with him saying he answers the phone with similar enthusiasm is not bad, but rather than concluding it just stops; the suspended quality is the equivalent of the awkward conversational pause where someone tells you a story and you're not quite sure if they've finished or not. If you read/hear the story as originally written, it's like a a rough canvas in a cluttered artist's studio: pretty, but increasingly hard to recall in detail as time goes by.<p>A strong conclusion emphasizes the underlying point and provides a contextual frame for the work, setting it apart from what surrounds it. Notice how the author's 'punchline' on 28/29 was 'made the phone call, changed my life' and he concludes by saying that his friend/mentor died, but keeps him motivated. Adams keeps it on the emotional level, moving from elation/triumph to wistful maturity, giving the advice (to make that call) far more impact: the closing sentence does not reinforce <i>how</i> he got the job - which is the substance and satisfaction of the story - but wonderfully articulates <i>why</i> he got it: because the artist was wise enough to learn from his audience. I could go on at length about how many levels this sentence works on, but its very best aspect is that it would work <i>just as well</i> as an intro to the story:<p><pre><code>  - Oh look at (impressive work), creator is/you are so awesome.\n  - Yep - but there's more to (field of endeavor) than what you see here. Let me tell you a story about a guy named Keith...\n</code></pre>\nOf course the story is not about Keith, per se; it's about the complex relationship between fear and ego, and how giving up control can be so much more fruitful than jealously defending one's territory. This is what makes it a much more compelling nugget than, say, another tale of making nine cold calls to reach that one customer. The latter is like a story which seems genuinely amusing, but 'you had to be there'. The well-framed story is like the professional comedian's version that everyone can appreciate - 'it's funny because it's true.'<p>This offers a technique that can be used in many, many contexts, from motivating yourself to communicating with your customers. Ask yourself: what is the point of what I am trying to do here? What is my basic agenda? In short, answer the basic question of <i>why (do you/should I care)?</i> Write that down: whatever you're doing, it's basically your 'mission statement'. Answer that, and the questions of <i>how</i> becomes much easier to articulate and to answer. When you're done, cut the beginning, and rewrite into a firm conclusion. Instead of requesting attention and then struggling to pay for it, stimulate curiosity and then supply a satisfying resolution. By doing so, you become a provider rather than a petitioner and create value for your audience instead of placing demands upon them.<p>It's astonishing how effectively this simple technique can improve your writing, and by extension, your thinking. An editor's role is to shape a narrative into a story.",1274732392

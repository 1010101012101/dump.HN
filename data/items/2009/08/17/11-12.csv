767876,comment,766796,766796,0,0,danielfranz,,,"Somebody just wrote that there is good old common-sense economics at work. I’d say the subprime crisis is also good old common-sense economics at work. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a healthy thing and it's good for the industry, for the economy or for society as a whole.<p>Quality journalism plays a critical role in our society. In every society - that includes the ones in ""Western"" states. The death of a newspaper in San Francisco or Boston is nothing less than a tragedy. Journalists do what they do - they write. They are obviously not exactly experts regarding the WWW and the ""new"" technology their distribution is based on now. They weren't capable of adjusting their business strategies and products to this disruption. Somebody needs to do that for them and the business model is not advertising alone anymore.<p>In the past they generated revenue from ads and from content bundling. In the print channel interesting and high-quality articles subsidized less interesting ones or even whole departments. On the web there are no bundles, content is atomized and shareable. Clicks and links are the currency and people only click on links to articles (and ads) they’re interested in. Therefore in my opinion the only possible solution is to stop relying on ads alone and start charging readers for the product itself, which is the content - INCLUDING the delivery and presentation of it.<p>Usually product development follows a business strategy of maximizing profit. Obviously that’s the profit of the company offering the product and not the profit of competitors and providers of supposed substitute products, like bloggers and evil news aggregators. But the technology makes the content shareable. It’s complicated and a somewhat ""socialistic"" approach to the problem would help. No worries, I don’t want to raise taxes or fees to finance the good, I certainly don’t think that’s the right way. All over the world press representatives ask the administrations to come up with ancillary copyright laws securing their interests. That’s ridiculous and shows that they didn’t even analyze the issue right.<p>Bottom line: I’d try the re-introduction of bundling through simple flat-rate payment - with a solution based on the economics of the web, not the print world. Readers don’t face any switching costs. If one publisher asks for payment they just go to another. But if we offer content of all sources in one place, combined with revolutionary features they don’t get anywhere else, there is something to charge for. Start focusing on the delivery and presentation of the content. Start listening to users’ needs instead of advertisers.<p>Journalists produce content. A third party platform is working as a personalized content hub based on simple XML-formatted or API-powered exchange of content and serving all kinds of reading devices. No, I am not talking about feed readers or Google News’ index but decent, well-planned apps and websites. The platform would have to offer really innovative features and top user experience and would be considered worth paying 2-3 USD/month. On a voluntary basis wealthy readers could even pay more and therefore get a higher ""supporter status"" they can communicate to the outside world (the same target segment already pays a lot for their LinkedIn accounts and other web-based services). It’s amazing what peer pressure can do.<p>That paid amount is being split and percentages are paid to the according publishers based on the user’s reading behavior. The meshing-up is contrary to the content strategy of most publishers today but could become interesting to them as soon as they face revenue in exchange. As a result publishers could focus on their core competency (investigating and writing) and earn from partly ""outsourced"" delivery, like they often did in times of paper delivery. They could also focus on niche topics to build up competency and reputation in order to be ""followed"" in those areas by readers through these hubs - a truly capitalistic mechanism.<p>Now the question is what are the killer features to make this happen? 1) The product would have to offer content from various sources. 2) It would have to improve the way readers can consume their daily or hourly news so drastically that they’re willing to pay a small amount. 3) Payment would have to be really simple. I do have thoughts on how to achieve this step by step with a freemium business model based on existing technologies and with existing shared content. I also have concrete thoughts on features as well as an almost finished product design. Personalization is the key.<p>I am looking for developers and front-end developers with state-of-the-art CSS and AJAX knowledge, who think what I just wrote is not just stupid utopia and would like to work on this sisyphean challenge. Who would like to build a team and apply at Y Combinator?

(I.e., will the simulation include feelings as part of its model? If it doesn't, aren't you begging the question in favor of physicalism?)</i><p>Do we care?  The non-materialists would argue that there's no possible way to simulate the brain completely, because of Teh Magic that surrounds it.  They'll never be convinced of any model of the extra stuff because by definition Teh Magic is impossible to know anything concrete about.  And the scientists will happily march right along because Teh Magic also has no actual effect on our world.<p>I'd argue that until proven otherwise, a simulation of the brain already incorporates Teh Magic factor, given that nobody has suggested an actual effect back on the physical world.  Since a simulation of the brain is only tasked with correctly producing the mapping from inputs to the outputs that we can actually measure, all that extra stuff is already correctly factored in, with a weighting factor of exactly 0.<p>When we reach that point, the non-materialists are welcome to submit evidence that the factor should not be 0, but they'll need to back it up with some evidence...<p><i>If we find something that doesn't obey the laws of current physics, we just modify the laws.

767845,comment,765387,767777,0,0,gdp,,,"> <i>You seem to have a strange definition of communism, as well as the history of nazism. Rather, you seem to be buying into the American propaganda that ""democracy is the great good""</i><p>I was being ironic and parroting the sentiments expressed in the post I replied to, which implied that my assertion that there are gains to be made by centralised government providing basic services was akin to Mao's ""great leap forward"" and various other things generally considered ""communist"".  I cited Nazism just to invoke Godwin's law and make the utter preposterousness of the argument evident.  Basically, the post I was responding to made the leap from ""elected government providing services to citizens"" to ""THAT'S COMMUNISM/TERRORISM/-ISM-ISM!"", which is patently absurd.<p>I used the ""democractically elected"" argument to differentiate from a totalitarian state that removes the freedom of choice from its citizens.  I'm not making any value-based statement about that, rather I'm just providing a point of reference, considering that all of the countries we were referring to with government-provided healthcare are ""western democracies"" in the very traditional sense.<p>> <i>You're just using the eight-year-old's ""but johnny gets to stay up late"" technique. And the answer is the same: just because one party does something really has not connection to whether it's the right thing for a different party to do.</i><p>Once again, I was responding to the tone of the post, which seemed to suggest that the entire world would crumble if they went down this path.  I was simply countering that the US is one of the few countries that <i>doesn't</i> provide healthcare in the way I described, which suggests that it's likely that it would succeed in the US in the same way that it has succeeded elsewhere.<p>It's a particularly arrogant brand of exceptionalism that would suggest that something that the rest of the developed world does is somehow totally unsuitable for implementation in the US.  I mean, is the suggestion there that the US is completely different from other countries with similarly-structured economies and demographics?<p>> <i>Today the government is the largest single funder of healthcare. But once they crowd out other actors, the entire medical profession will be political. That means that treatments will be put onto the approved list, and research dollars will be allocated, as a way of pandering for votes.</i><p>> <i>But diseases having real political constituencies -- AIDS/HIV is the big example -- will get enormous research, despite the fact that they account for a relatively small portion of the populace. Today, AIDS gets many times more funding per-sufferer than does, e.g., breast cancer.</i><p>There are not necessarily efficiencies of scale in medical research.  Providing 10 times more funding will not provide a cure 10 times faster.  Also, the general umbrella of ""cancer research"" almost certainly gets more funding than HIV/AIDS research.  I'm not a medical professional, but I assume that significant advances made in one sub-field of cancer research are likely to have impacts within many other sub-fields (in terms of increased understanding or promising treatment/prevention avenues).<p>> <i>Today the government is the largest single funder of healthcare. But once they crowd out other actors, the entire medical profession will be political. That means that treatments will be put onto the approved list, and research dollars will be allocated, as a way of pandering for votes.</i><p>That sounds like a problem with a particular instance of a government, not with governments everywhere.  Most scientific and medical research funding in any country I've lived in is administered by a reasonably apolitical body consisting largely of senior members of relevant research communities.  Policy makers then provide strategic direction to these bodies by setting priorities and earmarking some funding.  It's really not as though political entities are governing the entire process.  It's more likely that policy analysts are looking at diseases and demographics, and managing limited funds on the basis of where it can be best spent.<p>Not that I'm saying research funding models are perfect.  In fact, they are completely bonkers.  But they are not completely bonkers because of high-level political intervention.<p>Finally, I know I'm going to regret asking, but what is the ""real political constituency"" of HIV/AIDS that makes it different from any other disease with a similar number of sufferers and similar treatment/prevention options?",1250508591

I wrote enough C and Assembly to know it's hard, but  in my experience being a ""web guy"" is just as hard. In fact, it's a harder kind of hard for us introverted folks, because it involves understanding why people interact with your CRUD app the way they do. You can't just poke them with you oscilloscope probes and expect to get meaningful answers.",1250507820

When porn hit the web it was still something of a niche. It went from being fairly socially acceptable in the early 20th Century to a bit of a stigma around the time of the web (before my time so only what I have been told). Of course the web changed all that turning an already successful industry into a huge one.<p>So the makers had to find a new niche (edit: I mean before the web it was a niche - or rather what I really mean is that it was nowhere near as accessible). Suicide girls is a huge success because of the personal touch (I would say that 90% of PC's I see have porn on them and a vast majority of them have at least a few SG's images). Another popular one was the ""wild girls"" type spring break porn (soft and hardcore) - pretty much for the same reason, they werre girls you could see on a beach somewhere all the time, not super-made up pornstars. Again the personal touch.<p>And finally the customer base is more discerning? or perhaps more demanding :) Im guessing a lot of people prefer a personal touch to their porn to help get over that social barrier.<p>All just educated guesswork :)<p>EDIT: anyone happy to admit to being a regular (pay-for) porn consumer (I dont think HN will be judgemental in the way society seems to be!) and throw some light on these ideas from that side of things?",1250507790

Well, I suppose yes, for now, but that's only because your complete brain state is effectively hidden from the scientist because we don't have the technology to get a good picture of what's going on inside.  Give us a decent real time high resolution scanner, and your ""private"" experience is just another data set on a big computer somewhere.<p>A C++ program would be pretty damn inscrutable, too, if we couldn't core dump when things went wrong...<p><i>Look at any red object and compare it with any ""scientific"" description regarding wavelengths and retinas, neurons, synapses, neurotransmitters, visual cortexes, atoms, molecules, or what have you. Clearly none of these thing are in any way related to what it's actually like for you to see that red object.</i><p>Look at any Youtube video and compare it with the ""computer science"" description, with bits and bytes and encodings, filtered through the Flash player, etc.  One could argue that these things are <i>clearly</i> unrelated to some kid getting whacked in the nuts by his brother, but one would be wrong.<p>I'm extremely reluctant to accept the notion that our physical brains have no relation to how we experience the world (an idea you seem eager to accept) - we don't understand it very well, true, but that's partially because we're pretty stupid, and partially because we're not very far along in understanding it yet.<p>All that it takes for you to claim subjective experience is for your brain to be programmed to respond to the question ""Do you have subjective experience of the color red?"" in the affirmative.  To me, that's a lot easier to swallow that that's the case than to imagine there's Magic going on here...and yup, I'm happy to apply the same logic to my own experience, I don't attribute anything special to it other than a mere self-reinforcing computational delusion.<p>Personally, I find that a far more fascinating thing than the alternative, anyways...<p><i>Now, you may well believe that what's going on when you look at a red object is ""really"" some interaction between what those scientific terms describe in some model of what's going on with your brain, sensory organs, etc. But this requires a sort of suspension of disbelief, as you have to set aside your actual ""subjective"" experience of the red object itself</i><p>It really doesn't, though, unless you already ascribe something mystical and aphysical to this ""subjective experience,"" begging the question.<p>Someone else brought up the idea of a pzombie, someone that responds in every way <i>as if</i> they had subjective experience, but really doesn't.  Getting past WTF that would actually mean, since nobody ever bothers to define ""subjective experience,"" I think the heart of the question is this: if a pzombie responds <i>internally</i> as if it had subjective experience as well as externally, then isn't that enough for us to say that it does?  That's why I'm happy to write the whole thing off as a non-issue, even when thinking about my own experience - the fact that I believe I experience ""red"" means nothing more than that I believe it.<p>IMO anyone arguing against that first has to figure out what it means for a pzombie to lack subjective experience even though it looks, walks, talks, acts, and thinks as if it did.  Otherwise the argument is pretty pointless, kind of like asking what the world <i>would</i> be like if the prime number theorem was false.",1250507774

Because the author of the original blog post knew the purpose of HN, he would have recognised the incongruity between his statement (that coding and startup articles be filtered out) and the reality (that HN is all about coding and startup articles).

FlashcardDB is an attempt to build an online flashcard website that doesn't suck. <p>When I had decided it was time to tranfer my thousands of flashcards to a webapp, I just could not bring myself to use any of the existing flashcard sites on the web. Some are awful. Some are old and tired. One or two look good but they were just not what I had in mind. I wanted a dead-simple user interface and the Leitner System built-in -- with a cool graph! You know the rest. I decided to do it myself.<p>The first iteration of the site is at <a href=""http://FlashcardDB.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://FlashcardDB.com</a><p>If anyone feels like checking it out I would be happy to hear your criticisms.",1197554374

If any of the last 10 presidential elections had gone the other way, how would that have changed YOUR life?<p>Personally, I don't know the answer to that question.  But I do know that I have other things I'd rather spend my mental energy on.",1197554124

I can't seem to keep it clean and the traditional solution to this problem, marriage, has apparently run its course. My girlfriend is a software geek as well and hates to clean the kitchen (and vacuuming) even more than I do. So where is that long promised robot revolution? Bring it on!<p>And where is that website that lets me auction my food orders, to be delivered by the best bidder? And knowing about the food I eat, the site could also tell me which nutrients I'm supposed to consume more of and which ready meals contain them, excluding the ones I hate.<p>There are so many old unsolved problems. Anonymous hassle free micropayments for instance...",1197553812

89132,comment,89055,89055,0,0,brlewis,,,"Get the kitchen analogy out of your brain.  Kitchen needs are different from information needs.  What information do people want to get?  What information do people want to spread?  That universe is a lot bigger than your kitchen.<p>Any time you encounter pain or desire (yours or somebody else's) that's information-related, you've stumbled upon the opportunity for a web and/or mobile startup.  When you meet that need, people's demand for time online will grow to encompass what you've given them.",1197552699

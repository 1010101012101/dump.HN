This is a positive deflection from the baseline activity in the brain signals approximately 300 milliseconds after an anticipated event occurs. Note two key facts about this:<p>1) P300 actually varies by person; it can appear sooner or much later than 300 ms and have different amplitudes. Because of this, a training phase is required to train the classifier.<p>2) The P300 happens when an event happens the subject is anticipating or recognizes, so they have to be primed in some sense. For instance, the researchers asked subjects to think of an imaginary PIN, then flashed single digits at them one at a time and tried to infer what the first digit of the PIN was by that. Because they were thinking of, say, 1234, when 1 flashed on the screen, a P300 may have been generated.<p>What the researchers did was interesting, in that they made the case for potential malware in a consumer BCI game. Their accuracy rates weren't that great, however. This is a far far cry from nefarious agents pulling secret info from your brain.",1345920903

  comprising:

  1. receiving a user input, the user input is one or more input points applied to
  the touch-sensitive display that is integrated with the device;

  2. creating an event object in response to the user input;

  3. determining whether the event object invokes a scroll or gesture operation by
  distinguishing between a single input point applied to the touch-sensitive display
  that is interpreted as the scroll operation and two or more input points applied to
  the touch-sensitive display that are interpreted as the gesture operation;

  4. issuing at least one scroll or gesture call based on invoking the scroll or
  gesture operation;

  5. responding to at least one scroll call, if issued, by scrolling a window having
  a view associated with the event object based on an amount of a scroll with the
  scroll stopped at a predetermined position in relation to the user input; and

  6. responding to at least one gesture call, if issued, by scaling the view
  associated with the event object based on receiving the two or more input points in
  the form of the user input.

Here is text from the paper (<a href=""http://www.sonycsl.co.jp/person/rekimoto/papers/chi02.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sonycsl.co.jp/person/rekimoto/papers/chi02.pdf</a>) that accompanied this 2002 video (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waSXkJBKT1s#t=2m20s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waSXkJBKT1s#t=2m20s</a>) of this exact same behavior:<p><pre><code>  Figure 12 shows a map browsing system. The user scrolls the map by sliding a nger
  along the sensor surface. If the user touches the surface with two or more ngers,
  by changing the distance from the ngers to the surface, he/she can control the map
  scale. Simultaneous control of scrolling and zooming is intuitive, because the user
  feels as if his or her ngers are xed to the maps surface.

It's just a waste of screen space. Menus were fine. It's reorganising for nothing. It'll be a huge retraining code. I'm moving to OpenOffice RIGHT NOW!!111!eleven!<p>But it turned out that Microsoft's usability guys did know what they were doing. Power users, who were the only ones really making use of a lot of the more obscure menu options anyway, adapted (and realised that their old keyboard shortcuts did in fact still work). The remaining 99.99753% of the market seem to have found that Office apps got easier to use. I don't know a single person, outside of power users, who actually tried out the ribbon-style Office for more than a few days and didn't come to prefer it. And I don't know a single company who spent the much-prophesied fortune on retraining their staff to achieve that result, either.<p>I'm reserving judgement on Windows 8. I think some of the incremental UI changes in Windows 7, notably the new-style task bar and jump lists, were significant improvements. There were also a few very careless retrograde steps, like completely nerfing the folder view in explorer in about fifteen irritating little ways that were working just fine before. On balance, I do prefer working on my current Windows 7 machine to my previous Windows XP one. If they can build on the improvements with Windows 8, and perhaps correct a few of the long-standing and/or relatively recent irritations as well, I suspect Win8 as a desktop OS will do just fine. If they move too much around without a good reason, break lots more little things without the new top-level UI really being much of an improvement in practice, and make it feel like a dumbed-down UI that is to tablets as dumbed-down Windows gaming now is to consoles, then I suspect Win8 as a desktop OS will be a failure and Microsoft will pay an extremely heavy price for it.<p>But such is the nature of progress.

4432729,comment,4430885,4432507,3,0,_delirium,,,"One problem is that, under current law, you tend to only get those rates until you get sick. Insurance companies aren't allowed to actually jack up your rates if you get sick, but they tend to do so in tranches: every N years they'll discontinue one insurance program and institute a new one. Healthy people can apply for the new one with lower rates, but people with preexisting conditions will be denied a transfer to the new program. The old program will then enter a death spiral where only people who have e.g. cancer or diabetes are stuck there, because once you're seriously ill you can't go anywhere else (at least as an individual purchaser). Then the rates start being jacked up each year to account for the now-less-healthy pool. (This pattern is called the ""closed block"" problem, and some states have been attempting to add new regulations to restrict it.)<p>And of course if you had a childhood condition (beat childhood cancer, congenital heart defect, etc.) you can never buy in in the first place.",1345918221

4432727,comment,4432444,4432444,8,0,mrich,,,"Samsung played it well. They knew that they would sooner or later lose in court against Apple because the Galaxy S was just too similar. But they were able to drag it out so long that they now have their third-generation high end phone S III on the market which is sufficiently distinct from the iPhone. They also introduced some evidence late in this trial which was disallowed, which seems amateurish. It was probably done on purpose so they have more grounds for appeal - and until that goes to trial they will be the dominant force in the market and all the models infringing can be phased out by new models without much cost.<p>The interesting question is how far Apple will go attacking core Android with their ""obvious"" patents.",1345918169

However, Google was able to work around the universal search issue by modifying the code, and they replaced the bounceback behavior in scrolling with the ""glow"" thing, which (IMO) works just as well. So hopefully Google will be able to keep Android free of any patent issues (or maybe use the Motorola Mobility patents to force Apple into a cross-licensing deal).<p>So in the end, this may result in less meddling with the Android codebase by OEMs and carriers, something that all consumers will benefit from.",1345918167

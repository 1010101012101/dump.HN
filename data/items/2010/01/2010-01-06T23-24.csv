1036072,comment,1035100,1035100,0,0,dasht,,,"I must brag (because hopefully it's interesting):<p>About 22 or 23 years ago my mentor at the time, a unix guru, beat more or less that same list into my thick skull with a heavy schtick.  It was considered part of ""basic competency"" for unix.   The list, back then, came with a list of bitter exceptions (e.g., vendor X had broken ""rename(2)"" and it was not reliably atomic on those systems).<p>Why was it important?  The notion was that with a unix file system, and ""tiny tools"" connected by pipes, you really didn't need an SQL-based relational database for most tasks.  You had shell programs like ""cut(1)"", ""join(1)"", ""sort(1)"", ""grep(1)"", and ""sed(1)"".  In a pinch, you could reach for ""awk(1)"" but don't overdo it because the joke went ""Some people, whenever they have a problem to solve, reach for AWK.  Then they have two problems.""<p>A serious relational database would give you transactions and isolation - the ACID properties.   (Obtaining ""durability"" (the D in ACID) meant learning when and how to flush and sync the file system.)  Back then, on some historic versions of unix, you could also count on it to be atomic if you appended a text file with a modest length, single line, in a single ""write(2)"".  But even back then, that trick wasn't portable - just sorely missed from the good 'ol days.<p>Around about 2001 I set out to implement the GNU Arch revision control system.   I was steamed at how Subversion was large, complicated, hard to get working, and used a centralized server rather than a distributed and decentralized system.   I thought ""I can do better than that, easily!""  So I set out to prove it.<p>I wrote the initial self-hosting release of Arch as... wait for it ... <i>shell scripts</i>.   Initially, there wasn't a single line of original C code in the system.  It was all coded in /bin/sh, /bin/awk, /bin/find, with heavy use of sed, grep, cut, join, and sort.   It was sluggish but usable and, was indeed, one of the very first truly distributed and decentralized revision control systems.  It also delivered on the ""smart merging"" algorithms that Subversion had promised but that, to this day, has not succeeded in implementing.<p>One of the challenges of a revision control system is the critical importance of database integrity.  When you check your code in, when you make back-ups, etc -- and when multiple users may be doing the same thing at the same time on the same repository -- it's absolutely critical to keep the database consistent.   You need ACID updates to the database.<p>So, here is a fun puzzle:  Using just the atomic unix file system operations, you have to implement (as a shell script), a ""write once"" list-of-directories structure.  I'll illustrate what I mean:<p>We have a directory called ""the-list"".   Initially, it may contain arbitrary ""control files/directories"" that you design, but it is empty of ""data directories"".   The data directories we add will be named as numbers.  So the first one is ""the-list/0"", then ""the-list/1"", then ""the-list/2"" and so forth.<p>When a directory like ""the-list/1"" is installed, it should already contain data files.  E.g., ""the-list/1/patches.tar.gz"".   You aren't allowed to just ""mkdir the-list/1"" and then, after that, install ""patches.tar.gz"".   If ""the-list/1"" is there at all, it must already contain ""patches.tar.gz"".<p>The data directories must be created in order.   If two users both try to create ""the-list/1"" at the same time, one should succeed, and the other be forced to retry, perhaps creating ""the-list/2"" instead (after ""the-list/1"" already exists).<p>Finally, a program that <i>starts</i> to create ""the-list/1"" but then crashes must not harm the database.   It is OK if a user has to type a command like ""cleanup-after-crash"" but it must be possible to write such a command (as a shell script).   It is important that if someone types ""cleanup-after-crash"" while the program trying to create ""the-list/1"" is still running, that either the ""cleanup"" program does nothing, or the programing making ""the-list/1"" is forced to fail (and know that it failed, and report that to the user).<p>It sounds like something that should be trivially easy, right?  Well, it doesn't take a huge amount of code to solve but solutions to the problem are not obvious.  And many obvious attempts to solve the problem have subtle bugs that lose the ACID properties of the database.<p>GNU Arch source code (and perhaps the documentation, I forget) contains an answer key.   It might be more fun, though, if you've nothing better to do, to try to solve it yourself, first.",1262820155

It hasn't done it for all of them but it has for many of them. I'm not sure about all the details of the bug but be aware that it's likely your pictures will be replaced whether you want them to or not.<p>You also may have to sync a couple times before photos are synced to all the relevant contacts. Their photo download protocol looks pretty chatty and I guess some of the requests fail and they aren't re-trying until the next sync session.",1262819952

All software (including Flash and Skype) works out of the box as intended. Compared that to my experience of running Linux on PPC where even open source software didn't always work perfectly.<p>The experience for a Windows user is even more extreme; they are comparing a Windows machine which is the target/test platform for every vendor, to a Linux ARM machine where most software can be kind of sort of made to work, if you try hard enough. Atom's x86 ISA makes all that pain go away.<p>With battery life in atom systems beating 8 hours (i.e. a full days work and charge over night) there pain reduction of moving to ARM isn't as big as gaining binary compatibility.<p>The only people to whom this doesn't apply are Apple, who have two key things:<p>- A much stronger control over their platform and developers.<p>- Developers who are already used to multi-platform development thanks to PPC fat binaries and shared libraries between the iPhone and OS X.<p>Therefore I believe it will be necessary for Microsoft to _really_ support an ARM port before Atom is in any danger at all.

I think loss in such posts getting buried is much higher than the loss when other posts that say, just link to an interesting articles etc. get buried. Feedback from highly technical community like HN can be invaluable for an individual hacker but it's not always possible to get it. I personally experienced the importance of first 10 minutes rule when I submitted post about a small JS library that I had developed asking for feedback couple of days back. I probably submitted it at wrong time (holiday, late at night) so it never made to ""visible"" pages.<p>If we had a new channel exclusively for things you've actually built it would be difficult to game it as you would have to actually put in efforts to built the thing in the first place. It would also be more in line with the HN ethos, for hackers by hackers :)",1262818830

Subject: Engineering Lead for Social Applications
To: dev-jobs@rockyou.com<p>Hi, I'm interested in your opening for Engineering Lead for Social Applications.<p>I made a PHP page as a high school project that let me log in and create blog posts.  I required an admin account to log into the blog to write articles.  My user table (I used MySQL as a database backend), had four columns: id, email, username, password.  It sounds very simple, but please let me tell you some of the special technology I used for the password.<p>If someone used a password of ""password"", I would do something like this:<p>$plaintext = ""password"";<p>Then, I would use a function called sha1 to get a a new value of the password like this: $salt = sha1(md5($plaintext));<p>Then, I would get the final value to store as the password like so: $password = $md5($salt.$plaintext);<p>This way, the password is hidden behind what people call a hashing algorithm.  That keeps people from figuring out the original password, even if they somehow got on my computer!<p>I know I have no professional programming experience, but I think that I could be a very valuable member of your team.  If you're interested, please let me know!<p>-Scott",1262818821

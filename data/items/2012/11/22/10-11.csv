On linux distros (especially since most stuff is open source) they try to get everything be 64 bit on 64 bit installs, some distros don't even ship 32 bit system libraries by default. That's why linux users wanted 64 bit flash so much(you need 64 bit plugins for a 64 bit browser although there was a hack called nspluginwrapper to let you use 32 bit flash in 64 bit fiefox). I'm guessing there is a somewhat similar push on OS X to get all 64 bit software on a 64 bit os.<p>On windows, firefox is just a single installed program(unlike linux where firefox's library might be shared with thunderbird, etc.), and a number of apps are 32 bit, and thats fine. Plus there is a larger selection of plugins many of which may never get a 64 bit version.<p>Also I may be wrong but I think that browsers these days have a lot of per architecture optimizations targeting x86 and separately arm(x86-64 optimization being a lower priority), so that 64 bit browsers may actually be slower.",1353579939

If that's the case, it makes sense that you would provide a little more explanation for critical concepts such as variables. In chapter 3, specifically, it feels as if you gloss over the topic by deeming it a ""a space to put data."" Maybe you're just looking for your audience to build an intuitive notion of the concept, but annecdotally I've always enjoyed learning the essential details when tackling new topics.<p>(3) Speak authoritatively; don't inject fluff into your sentences. It drains mental capacity. For some examples:<p>""You just press that button and it will compile and run your program. Or you can just press F5 and that will do the same thing"" ==> ""Press that button, or F5, to compile and run your program.""<p>""The new method Console.ReadLine() is pretty self explanatory, it reads a line of text from the console"" ==> ""Console.ReadLine() reads a line of text from the console.""<p>Concise, to the point, and much more effective.

4818190,comment,4816744,4818139,6,0,vidarh,,,"> The part I don't understand about this view is why would Sweden be more likely to extradite him to the US than the UK would?<p>Sweden has cooperated with handing political asylum seekers over to the CIA, knowing they would be sent back to Egypt to be tortured, in blatant violation of Swedish law and international obligations. Wikileaks published documents showing that <i>years</i> after CIA rendition flights had supposedly stopped, the US ambassador had been officially summoned to receive a complaint after Swedish military intelligence had uncovered that they were still happening, with the knowledge of airport staff.<p>Meanwhile, in the UK, there are extradition cases that have gone on for a decade with no resolution, as UK courts take this very seriously, and a substantial portion of extradition requests from the US are refused.<p>To add on to that, consider the behaviour of the Swedish police and prosecutors. Maybe they are just inept. Maybe there are other motives for how they've acted. But if you're someone like Assange, who has seen several US politicians calling for him to be executed, coupled with past illegal handovers from Sweden to the CIA, it wouldn't be that strange to get a bit paranoid about things such as why the case was reopened after it had been closed, and why the prosecutors categorically refuse to interview him abroad, when they've done that for substantially more serious crimes.<p>Personally I think that the most likely explanation is not US involvement, but ""just"" political point-scoring by the prosecutor and appointed lawyer for the alleged victims, both of whom have a history of trying to get support for making Swedish laws regarding rape substantially stricter.",1353578581

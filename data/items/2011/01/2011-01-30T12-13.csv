For some people there just aren't enough lessons in the world to pull off an unauthentic personality. For most of us we have to learn to deal with it but when you have $50B in the bank I'm sure it becomes less of a priority. I suspect the only reason he's involved in any of these PR efforts is because he calculated that a bad personal reputation is bad for Facebook too. Sometimes you really need to cut people some slack when they're in these extraordinary positions. There's no handbook for 27 year old billionaires. The best advice anyone could give him is to just be himself and let the rest of the world deal with it.<p>I just hate the idea that the whole world has to be structured to maximize our personal entertainment and comfort.

Some of it goes towards maintaining the dams that provide a lot of power to the state.  And some of it goes towards cleaning up Hanford - the federal government hasn't picked up the entire tab for that, even though it should.  Some of it goes towards education, of course.  --Let's be honest, agriculture has brought a lot of immigrants to that side of the State, and the Pasco School District, for example, has the highest percentage of ESL students than any other school district in the state.<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with the political leanings of much of Eastern Washington, and even now I have no desire to ever move back there, but having grown up there, I can certainly attest to the fact that things are much more complex than you seem to believe.",1296389229

Splitting up gives you the chance to do that 'reset' and fix a lot of institutional problems that seem daunting otherwise, but you have the opportunity for the same 'reset' with a convention, although there's nothing to keep a convention from making it even worse.",1296389200

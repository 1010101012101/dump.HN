36156,comment,36075,36075,0,0,henryw,,,"Interesting excerpt from the article:<p>""Does this add credence to Apple's position that 3rd party applications are not allowed on the iPhone for security reasons?  <p>We don't think so. Almost all of the security engineering effort on the iPhone seems to have been spent protecting the revenue model, rather than protecting the user (which is, of course, an entirely understandable position). For example, a constrained environment is used to prevent users from loading new ringtones onto the phone, but the applications are not run in a constrained environment to contain damage caused by hackers who exploit them.""",1185218399

If the system I'm building is sufficiently small, I go ahead and code it right away and simplify as it's built.<p>If the system is large (for example, I'm currently building something which is around 1000+ lines) I write a functional spec first, figuring out the high level design and a few nitty-gritty lower level things.  This helps simplify things because you can see exactly how two pieces that look similar can be split off into one piece.",1185217733

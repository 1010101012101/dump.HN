128389,comment,128183,128383,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"I suppose ""inspiring"" isn't the right word, but I think a better understanding of what failure looks like and its statistical frequency is important.  Behavioral psychology says most people are far more motivated by fear than by greed.  I suspect the unknown is worse than what really happens in failure.  Well, except for John Fitch; he blew his brains out.",1204584686

Ask your attorney for a ""due diligence"" checklist: both funding and acquisition teams tend to look for the same documents and disclosures. The more you can keep all of that straight and documented from the beginning (e.g. purchase agreements, license agreements, major supplier contracts, ...) the easier it is later on.",1204584502

They should get more mention.  Philo Farnsworth? John Fitch?  These guys invested huge chunks of their lives but got nothing.<p>I suspect detailing what failure looks like is probably more inspiring than all this focus on the payoff.

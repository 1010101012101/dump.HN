Even if Apollo catches on like nothing since C, it wouldn't kill Firefox; the user still needs a browser.<p>Yes, FF supports rich application development in XUL, and yes, Apollo might compete with that somewhat, but it doesn't really matter.  XUL is there not as a feature but as a tool: the FF UI is built with XUL.  That it is useful for others is really just a detail.  In FF3, there will be more emphasis and support given to XUL apps, but still, it's there for the browser.<p>Also, the degree of competitions between FF and Apollo is, I think, overestimated.  Apollo is basically just another RAD toolkit.  XUL apps aren't desktop apps, they run directly in the browser just like Ajax apps.  That gives them an entirely different use case than Apollo.  (E.g. if FF becomes widespread, XUL might compete with Ajax when building something like gmail.  Apollo wouldn't--a desktop app built with web tech is still a desktop app.)",1174366790

Good early feedback, much appreciated. <p>I'm building CrowdVine because I want to see social networks treated as first class social media applications, joining blogs, wikis, and pod/video-casts. <p>In response to the nothing to do but read blogs comment, in a niche social network the people are the content. Connecting to them and finding ways to build an identity within the community are the main activities. If you're applying social networks in way that ties in with people's identity then you can have a lot of socializing without a lot of features. If you're (mis)applying a social network to a topic that has nothing to do with people's identity then you're going to have to build in a lot of other activities.<p>I think it's a big boon that Ning decided to focus just for the fact that it helps define the market. They obviously have an amazing team. It'll be interesting to see if they stay with the social-networks-for-everyone market given that they're already doing deals for bigger networks (for CBS), neither of their founders actually uses the software to run a social network, and that they're already 27 people big and 9 million in the hole. \n",1174365807

5115,comment,5031,5041,0,0,pg,,,"The VC model encourages/forces founders to go for huge exits. You can't do a series A round and then sell the company for 10 million.  Probably not even 20.  The VCs won't let you. So they're more likely to get the giant outcomes that make up for the losses on the rest of their portfolio.  Whereas there's nothing to prevent the founders of a startup we fund selling early for comparatively little. <p>Also, VCs have leverage working for them.  They get a percentage of the returns on other people's money.  We're using only our own.<p>Smaller principal x lower returns = less profit. Probably.  But we're hoping to make enough that we can at least keep doing this.",1174365499

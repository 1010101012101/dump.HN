When you leave, you take your key card with you and everything is powered off. This makes it easy and painless to be environmentally responsible without ever worrying about leaving the lights on or adjusting the thermostat.",1220316978

We licensed software from academics, and during integration you'd find there were methods that seemingly ran afoul of an obscure patent, etc.  These were not improvements (just general algorithms)",1220315966

292251,comment,291946,292225,0,0,kilowatt,,,"Agreed on the presentation.<p>What struck me is how technical it was (for a comic book quick overview). It's obviously geared towards developers--they really wanted to plant their flag in the sand and say ""we're doing this: here is why it is good.""",1220315563
292250,comment,292170,292194,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I happen to be reading ""Good to Great"", the followup to this book, and I find its idea of ""Level 5 Leadership"" pretty interesting. Basically ""Level 5 Leaders"" are the exact opposite of what you typically think of as a CEO - self-effacing, stay in the background, rarely take credit for their successes, generally attributing them to luck or to the great people who work for them. But there's a paragraph that talks about how that's the exact wrong personality you need to become a CEO - generally the self-promoting, egotistical types get the nod, and that's why there are vanishingly few great companies.",1220315381
292249,comment,292186,292186,0,0,brianlash,,,"It's good advice, but I don't like the way this article rests on the assumption that studying before an exam is this dreaded beast in the academic experience.  Cramming's one thing... no one likes to sweat through those final precious hours leading up to a test.<p>But spending a few hours/day in the library the week leading up to an exam never killed anyone.  I kind of enjoyed my time alone to pore over my semester's notes.  It was meditative.<p>The advice in this article (take notes like study guides, study them over 2 10-minute intervals each day) is harmless enough. I just don't like the presentation.",1220315310
292248,comment,291946,292056,0,0,netcan,,,"That is an interesting question. (An is it evil question ).<p>I guess it comes down to what they are trying to achieve with the browser in the first place. Is it improving the web experience or creating a dominant browser?<p>I think it's likely that the latter will creep in once they're at it for a few years. But for now the first seems to be a pretty important goal. For now, Firefox is a pretty important way to further that goal. And for now, Google seems happy enough to sink some cash into that goal. $15m-$20m p/y is probably a reasonable sum (compare to other expenses in this area) as long as A: Firefox significantly improves the web for users & B: That is a Google goal that they're willing to pay for.<p>It's not charity either. What's default search worth on the open market? Probably something.",1220315280

292244,comment,291946,292049,0,0,mpk,,,"You can bet they will. The V8 engine is unlikely to present much of an obstacle. We have a large JS codebase and the Opera, WebKit (Safari), Spidermonkey (Gecko/Firebird), Rhino (Spidermonkey port to Java) and JScript (IE6/7) engines are no hassle to support.<p>The hard part is DOM interaction and styling. But as they're using WebKit and are putting a lot of effort into compatibility - this should be a breeze.<p>The really hard work is support for IE6. 1990s JS assumptions, very bad and inconsistent DOM behaviour, etc.<p>New, open JS engines with a different take on executing JS (Tamarin, V8) are wonderful news for JS developers everywhere. And consumers too, of course.",1220314767

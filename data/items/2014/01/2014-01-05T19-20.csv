7017235,story,7016999,,1,0,codex,,,"A published paper vs a mailing list post, is that the way of it?  From what I&#x27;ve seen, PSNR is the most widely used codec scoring method, and most of the PSNR complaining comes from losing codecs, but with never any rebuttal data.  It&#x27;s not perfect but does correlate with human visual perception.",1388951763

7017120,comment,7015814,7016163,1,0,bradleyland,,,"It&#x27;s not immediately obvious why this is a security issue, and this doesn&#x27;t result in any disclosures or privilege escalation, but this is still a security issue, because it means the values aren&#x27;t being validated for consistency when saved. It is possible that the authors of the code saw it and let it pass because there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a direct vulnerability here, but any time you allow a user to manipulate your app in to an internally inconsistent state, it&#x27;s a security failure. Other code that depends on consistent internal state may break in unexpected ways.",1388950325

By far, the most trouble I had writing 2/3 compatible code was the string handling. It was pretty painful.<p>[1] - <a href=\"http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/5/21/porting-to-python-3-redux/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/5/21/porting-to-python-3-redux/</a>",1388949049

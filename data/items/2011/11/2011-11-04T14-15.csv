3196264,comment,3195614,3196004,6,0,raganwald,,,"Well, friction is on ongoing cost but doesnt result in some catastrophic event down the road, whereas debt may or may not have an ongoing cost but carries with it some non-trivial probability of disaster. Like real debt, the longer you wait to eliminate it, the more expensive it is to fix and the worse the catastrophe if you ont fix it.<p>So... I tend to think of source control problems as being infrastructure debt, because you are definitely going to crash and burn eventually, and the longer you wait, the worse the problem will be. I am open to rethinking this, but I would classify automated deployment as being friction. If you can deploy by hand, and everybody knows how to deploy by hand... It seems that deploying by hand is probably friction while you are in development and then debt once the product is in actual production with end users. In development, you might make a mistake, forget a library, and fixing it is work but not catastrophic. But once you have actual users, making a deployment mistake could produce irrevocable disaster.<p>Anyways, just to be clear, Im only bringing up the distinction for the sake of discussion. I like the post just the way it is.",1320418576

I suppose down voting = difference of opinion on HN these days.......<p>yes, and they stand for open source software too.  Open source is devaluing developers in the long run.  With all of the free open source software being released, many companies don't need software engineers because all of the hard work is already completed.  Many only really need software mechanics, which tinker with the already existing code and add features.  As more and more owners realize this, salaries for developers will slowly drop.<p>I've already seen this at a few companies.  Instead of hiring a team of developers to work on something, the company hired one developer and used an open source app.  You don't really need a college education for this type of work.",1320418276

The ruby-core team decided to change ruby so that after parsing the source the AST would be thrown away as part of some kind of optimization. That means things like ParseTree don't work anymore, and you can't inspect the AST of a Proc at runtime.<p>However, with sourcify you can sort of emulate the 1.8 behaviour, but it's not perfect. It uses ripper to parse the   file where the Proc is defined, and then provides the same callbacks that ParseTree does. It mostly seems to work, but it does run into problems if two Procs are defined on the same line, eg: users.select { ... }.select { ... }.<p>I'm actually a little disappointed that ruby-core decided to go in this direction. I think that decision will end up <i>costing</i> the community because it makes it harder for runtime introspection of code. It means less tools will be written on top of the runtime, and things like Ambition become harder if not impossible to do reliably.

Not too good not too bad, just OK. This is not to say that I am a bad programmer or I lack the knowledge of good coding practices. I do have them and I try my best to stick to them. I also try to learn on my own in my free time. It is just that all the opportunities that I have got were quiet trivial - basic CRUD applications. Now I think its time to move on and do some work on serious and cool stuff - cause that is what I wanted to do. Stuff that really matters. Stuff that will be used by people. Perhaps a startup would be the right place or even may be a big company, bottomline is that the nature of work should be exciting.<p>However I have some trouble moving to other place. Wherever I go for an interview I get rejected. This is due to 2 reasons:
1. I don't have a formal education in computer science. So if they ask any questions regarding data structures, algorithms I get stuck. This sends a wrong impression.
2. Though I am a Java programmer and I think I am quite good at it, they ask questions about technologies I have not worked on. So they think I am just a dumb programmer. Should I have been familiar with all technologies related to Java? Should I have learnt a new language?<p>I am quiet desperate to move to a hard core techie place. But I am not sure how should I upgrade myself. I know I have to do some homework, but I am not sure what should I do which will get me to the place I would want to work. Should I start reading the computer science basics - what ever they teach at college? Even after that I am not sure if I will make through. Should I learn a new language or technology - even then there are lots of them and each company uses one or other - so it would be like shooting arrows in the dark.<p>Can some one provide advice on how I can revamp my career. I am ready to spend time to read stuff and upgrade myself even if it takes a long time for me.<p>There is also another issue. I am more looking towards startups as I think I would fit their culture well. However I don't know where can I find startup jobs. They are not available at monster or naukri. Even if they are they are sporadic. hasgeek.in and other sites don't have many jobs in java. Please advise on this as well.",1320415320

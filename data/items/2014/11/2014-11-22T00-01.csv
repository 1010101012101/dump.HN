If it&#x27;s really an indispensable historical archive, as they claim, surely someone is willing to put up some dough and see that twitpic is fairly compensated for relinquishing control of that archive. This goes double now that Twitter is a public company.

8644270,comment,8599640,8612259,0,0,ultimape,,,"I&#x27;d argue that all &#x27;games&#x27; are about manipulating attention - its just a question of what means they use to do so. Game design is really a sort of meta-game about designing systems that effect the behavior of players. Consider: Game Mechanics and Mechanism Design ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXdfU2DoF8o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXdfU2DoF8o</a> )<p>I&#x27;m fully with you on the notion that we shouldn&#x27;t be manipulating players life like farmville. Johnathan blow put on a great talk about games and the human condition where he covers this aspect quite scathingly: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqFu5O-oPmU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqFu5O-oPmU</a><p>To completely ignore this aspect is to develop a game with no real-stickyness factor. Money aside, don&#x27;t you want a game that people enjoy playing? The entire point of an MMO is to have a large reoccurring user-base. There is an art to it, and getting it right can make really powerful games: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZGCPap7GkY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZGCPap7GkY</a><p>For board games like chess, much of the appeal for the average player is that you get to sit down with a friend and compete, and in doing so the &#x27;intellectual nature&#x27; of the game ends up pulling them in for the long term. Perhaps the answer to the meta-game of stickiness is to create a community around the game in a similar vein to the one from the ants ai challenge&#x27;s forums.<p>Were I to work on this project, I&#x27;d make a strong push toward git-like integration ala the work done behind KhanAcademy&#x27;s live editor like discussed in this talk: <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/talk-khan-academy-computer-science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/talk-khan-academy-computer-science/</a>. - being able to share code behaviors with your team-mates (you are going to implement a guilds system, no?) and encourage discussions about behaviors at large would really help spurn the creation of a community.<p>To that end, have you considered creating more of a PvE aspect to things? Needing to conquer your local enemy denizens before finding other players would be an awesome way to encourage teamwork and camaraderie. Like in EVE, to be able to mine in the more mineral rich areas, you&#x27;d need to have more than one player&#x27;s worth of resources and expertise.<p>This is the actually the  direction I&#x27;m taking for my Ant game - in this case the various phenotype are actually things you unlock by conquering more advanced AI tribes.

8644268,comment,8642988,8642988,0,0,westoncb,,,"Seems like the other book people recommend is &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot; by Cormen et al, so that the main problem in choosing an algorithms book is really deciding between that one and this one.<p>I&#x27;ve spent more time with the Cormen book so far and only a little with &quot;The Algorithm Design Manual&quot;, but have to say I&#x27;ve been disappointed with Cormen and very impressed by the ADM.<p>I think the Cormen book has a reputation for being more serious, and it does give more in-depth mathematical treatments of the algorithms covered—but honestly, I think it&#x27;s a mistake to consider it more serious for that reason. There&#x27;s a time where I would have stopped reading this comment and ordered the Cormen book, but I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to consider criteria for a book being serious. In the realm of software, I&#x27;ll argue that the most important measure is how much the book improves your ability to create serious software—and under those conditions, The Algorithm Design Manual takes the prize.<p>In case there&#x27;s still ambiguity on what &#x27;serious software&#x27; might mean, I&#x27;ll point out that the ADM is not a recipe book—I&#x27;m not trying to say, &quot;practically speaking the algorithm problems in software are solved, you just have to copy and paste the source for the required algorithm.&quot; For crafting difficult, original algorithms, I still think ADM will be more useful.",1416617851

(Though just removing real names would still leave a lot to be desired in the anonymizing process).<p>However there&#x27;s no mention in these posts of such safeguards, and subjectively the post reads more like the analyst is just fishing around in the full raw dataset of ride times, start and end locations, and names. To wit:<p>&quot;What else can we learn? First, we can devise a way to statistically assess whether there are more women or men in a neighborhood than we’d expect. [...] We used Rapleaf’s Name to Gender API to assess the likelihood of a rider’s gender given their name, only accepting a match if the probability was >= 95%.&quot;<p>And in the original post, he categorizes rides as possibly related to a late-night hookup based on whether the destination and departure points for 2 rides are within 0.1 mi of each other.<p>>Internal metrics teams nearly always have access to complete data. The issue is sharing non-anonymized data externally.<p>I disagree pretty strongly with this. Do you think that your average Uber rider would be OK with Uber employees analyzing their ride patterns (with their real names attached) to try to figure out where and when they are having sex? Do you think Uber should allow such access to its employees by policy? (It seems we agree that writing a blog post about it is not a great idea.)",1416617609

way to find similar companies seems really useful.<p>1.) The site does not function without javascript. In most cases, this
won&#x27;t matter, but in some cases it will be a non-starter. This often
causes significant accessibility problems for the blind.<p>1.1) I realize you&#x27;re doing just about everything in javascript, but
this means there is no way to share a link to a particular search. Using
url parameters like most other search engines solves this issue.<p>2.) The modal and forced email entry when trying to &quot;view more&quot; and
&quot;view details&quot; is unexpected and unpleasant. Though you certainly want
to get email addresses from users, you&#x27;re violating the principle of
least surprise here, and many users will be uncomfortable with handing
out their email address.<p>3.) The text/copy shown when forcing email entry is coarse and
uninformative:<p>><i>&quot;Great! We&#x27;re happy you&#x27;re enjoying our product. Please enter your
email address to continue using Nova.&quot;</i><p>Is there a reason why a user would want to give you their email address?
If you can communicate a reason, it&#x27;s a better approach.<p>BTW, you might want to remove the &quot;no@example.org&quot; address I entered for
testing, and you might want to do some verification of entered
addresses (not easy, but doable).<p>4.) After getting the &quot;Thanks!&quot; on email entry, the &quot;view more&quot; and
&quot;view details&quot; links still don&#x27;t work.<p>5.) Your database of businesses is too incomplete, and your similarity
algorithm needs improvement. (Note: a small number of database entries
may be entirely forgivable if you&#x27;re just starting out and are looking
at your lengthy todo list with lots of data you need to import ;-). I
tried searching on two company names, [Rocket EMS] and [Information
Handling Services] as well as the common abbreviation for the later
[IHS]. The first (rocketems.com) is a newer and specialized local
company, and the second (www.ihs.com) is very well known and has been in
business for more than 50 years. You returned no results for the two
company names, and mostly incorrect results for [IHS].<p>(sorry, reading Matt Cutts of Google and similar search related sites
has me in the habit of using square brackets [] around queries)<p>You did locate one of the many subsidiary sites (brand names basically)
of IHS, namely &quot;IHS Engineering360 Media Solutions&quot;, but not the parent
company. Though the subsidiary site does earn some of its living through
&quot;Marketing & Advertising&quot; (this tag is most likely derived from SIC
codes), it&#x27;s not exactly correct or complete. Since you seem to be
basing your &quot;similarity&quot; measure on SIC codes, the &quot;similar&quot; companies
listed are very dissimilar.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely certain what I should have expected from the phrase,
&quot;find similar companies&quot; so maybe my expectations were too high?<p>Well, it may be a little rough in a few places at present, but a company
similarity search engine seems really useful to me, and I wish you luck
with it.",1416616676

If we&#x27;re taking Git literally here, you need to get the current head somehow, then fetch the commit object, then fetch the root directory object it points to, then fetch the index.html blob object it points to.  If we&#x27;re not using HTTP URLs to name the objects, and the objects in question are small, it would be pretty easy to configure the server to &quot;optimistically&quot; bundle the commit, the directory, and the blob into the response to the request for the head, so it could be a single RTT.<p>It might actually be more efficient to do a single-version shallow clone than to fetch all the relevant assets with separate HTTP requests.  Git already supports shallow clones, and you can already use them to clone things like Github wikis, and now you can even push from them: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6941889/is-git-clone-depth-1-shallow-clone-more-useful-than-it-makes-out"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6941889/is-git-clone-dep...</a>.

My phone has 400+ megabytes of RAM.<p>More promisingly, though, Git blobs are identified by their hashes.  That means that if both my home page and your home page use Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2, your phone only needs to download it once to render both home pages, since it can see from the blob IDs in the Git directory that it already has the relevant blobs.  (Assuming it hasn&#x27;t been optimistically included in the initial message response!)  It doesn&#x27;t have to worry that one of us might be serving up a maliciously-backdoored version in order to steal users&#x27; login cookies on the other&#x27;s site.  By the same token, you can accept the blobs from anyone who has a copy, who might be closer to you on the network than the origin server.  Especially if, like me, you&#x27;re in Argentina with a 250ms ping time to the US.<p>(This assumes you&#x27;re using something cleverer than the standard git clone protocol, which builds a thin pack including all the objects you lack.)<p>So git-cloning websites to view them could actually be <i>faster</i> than loading them over HTTP the way we do it now, because it eliminates a lot of the unnecessary security issues that we work around with bandwidth duplication and high latency.",1416616199

I was unemployed for about 6 months, during which I tried every job website out there, and thought each one was terrible.<p>I had some programming experience, so I hacked up a demo that I tried to put out there in 2010 called Scoople, but it was a single page php file that ran horribly and was really bad code. Initially I looked for a technical cofounder, but couldn&#x27;t find anyone. So I decided to learn myself.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the last 4 years jumping from job to job, from IT Administrator to Computer Consultant to Web Developer to finally Rails web developer, and now I help build startups for a living. During the past 5 months I finally felt I had enough experience to build the job website I always wanted, and so I built TrueJob, which I&#x27;m calling OkCupid for Jobs.<p>I&#x27;ve made an imgur gif album of all the features here if you&#x27;d like to check out that first (more features to come!):<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/rDkaw#0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/a/rDkaw#0</a><p>The idea is that you sign up with just an email and password, and then fill out your profile -- manually (one field at a time), by authenticating with LinkedIn, pulling from JSONResume, etc.<p>It then gives you a base set of recommended jobs, which you can then start to tweak by rating 1-5 stars a job posting, or favoriting/blocking certain attributes about that job posting-- company name, job title, job description keywords, etc.<p>My site then crunches the numbers, and reranks and reprioritizes the job postings so the most relevant matches are always at the top.<p>Once you apply for a job, employers look at your resume, and favorite or block things about it as well in order for them to get the best candidates -- but not to fear! Once you apply for a few jobs, you&#x27;ll get back analytics on why someone didn&#x27;t like your resume -- what keywords they hated, and which ones they loved, so you know what to change before you apply to the next job.<p>Hate my site? You can at least take the information you put in your profile, and convert it over to a hard copy PDF, with one of a few design styles. Take it to another place, or just use it to get a job! I just want to help people get into a job, whether they use my site or not -- job seekers too often get kicked in the teeth as it is, I want to help them succeed :)<p><i></i>A few caveats! (PLEASE READ)<i></i><p>* Right now, I haven&#x27;t seeded the database with that many jobs, only about 1000, and all from Michigan, so if you wonder why you keep getting suggested Detroit jobs, now you know why. This is my number one priority right now -- my biggest struggle is finding a source for jobs that doesn&#x27;t anonymize a lot of the important data like employer name, salary, etc, so if anyone knows of a great source to pull structured job postings from where I can link back to the original employer company page, let me know.<p>* The profile to PDF feature isn&#x27;t working <i>quite</i> yet, so that will be my release next week along with creating scrapers that can get me a ton more job postings (or if you have any other ideas of how to get clean job postings, let me know). I&#x27;m also hoping it entices people to check back on the site every so often, in order to see the new stuff I&#x27;m planning!<p>This has been a labor of love for me guys -- I&#x27;ve been developing this app for the past 5 months after spending 4 years trying to get the experience to build it.

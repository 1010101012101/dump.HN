223493,comment,223375,223375,0,0,celticjames,,,"This seems like a gross misunderstanding of Richard Dawkins's argument. The neo-darminist claim is that all genes are inherently selfish. In order for a gene to survive, that gene must have a phenotypic effect that maximizes the survival of the gene. Because natural selection occurs at the level of the gene, altruistic genes disappear from the gene pool. So I don't know what the scientist quoted in the article could possibly mean when he says he has discovered <i>the</i> selfish gene. (I hope it is not necessary to point out on this forum that selfish genes have nothing to do with the selfishness or altruism of an individual organism. Selfish genes can produce altruistic people if that's the phenotypic effect that helps them survive.)",1214024339

If no one gets rich spamming Craigslist and everyone instead gets poorer because it's too expensive, then no one will spam Craigslist.<p>Combine the per-post micropayment with the forfeiture of your account balance one if you are caught spamming and I think this would be an effective deterrent.  There will be fools who will still spam.  They will just do it elsewhere.<p>It's like the two guys in the woods confronted by a bear.  One ties his running shows and the other asks if he could really outrun the bear.  The first guy says: ""I don't have to outrun the bear, just you!""",1214023532

What problems in compiler optimization are more important than problems in protein folding? You seems to indicate that protein folding is a basic science problem and not a ""practically useful discipline"". In fact, your statement ""It would be great if we could predict protein structure accurately, but we can't, and until we can, it's not a practically useful discipline"" says that the because the problem isn't solved, it's not important, but it will be important when it's solved. So, trying to solve the problem is important, no?<p>But, you don't say anything about compiler research, and specifically compiler optimization research and development, which you claimed is much more important. What specific areas in compiler optimization (or just in compiler design) are more important than protein structure prediction and modeling?",1214020948

If startup takes this investment at proposed valuation and then raises the rest of the money necessary for the seed stage, it spend well over 25% equity recommended to set for seed stage [by Paul Graham].<p>It seems that such negotiation may easily end up in a pointless Valuation-A VS Valuation-B discussion. Which incentives can startup offer to seed investor in such circumstances?<p>Basically: Lets set the cap at $Y so that..",1422993563

(In many situations, it&#x27;s also illegal: see &quot;dumping&quot;.)  Unless you can complete wipe out the competition and force them out of business, you&#x27;re pouring money down the drain, and building nothing of value with it.  Bing Cashback resulted in most people doing their searching on Google, identifying what they wanted to buy, and then buying it on Bing so that Microsoft would pay them.<p>You get very odd arbitrage situations that basically result in funneling money straight from the corporation that&#x27;s being idiotic to a savvy consumer.  If a company did what you suggest, I would immediately sign up with them, along with my fiancee.  We would then use the app every time we took a trip together or picked each other up.  Since one of us is the driver and one is the passenger and the driver earns more than the passenger pays, we&#x27;d be making money at this company&#x27;s expense every time we drove somewhere.  Now imagine every carpool, group of friends, or just random strangers who setup a business to exploit this arbitrage opportunity doing that.",1422993521

Second, I have said what I wanted to say and I will not say it again.&quot;[0])<p>After doing a bit of digging, however, I&#x27;m a bit concerned.  Now, Lee is almost 90, and has suffered a stroke that seems to have had lasting effects. She filed a lawsuit in 2007 against the son-in-law of her former agent, claiming that he took advantage of her mental state during her recovery and duped her into assigning him the copyright to <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>[1]. For much of her adult life, her sister handled press relations and shielded Lee from these pressures. Her sister passed away three months ago, and suddenly this new book comes to light[2].<p>I really hope these suspicions are wrong, and that there&#x27;s nothing shady at play here.

Which it has done in this case.<p>So the more interesting question from an economics perspective is whether or not capturing the marginal GDP of this business is a better or worse for the people. Sure the bookstore goes poof, and folks can&#x27;t get cheap used books any more. The business will be replaced by something that can afford both the higher labor rate, like an upscale coffee shop or maybe a designer boutique.<p>But the number of bookstores goes down by one, and the volumes available are not available in the library. So the community has lost something too.<p>Nominally the markets are there to express what is a good application of capital by meeting demand. Should it go to running a bookstore or running a coffee roaster or a blog aggregator Etc. But the artificial floor of minimum wage creates artificial barriers to applying capital. You can see in this post that the floor of $10 allows the bookstore to exist, the floor of $15 does not. So here is a fiscal policy which is going limit choices.<p>And a really interesting effect is that everyone is going to raise prices to cover that expense, they have too, and so all of those folks who were complaining that they can&#x27;t afford to eat at the &#x27;upscale&#x27; bars and bistros in California its just going to get worse for them, and it won&#x27;t be the Googlers or Twitterers or Pinsters causing that upswing, it will be the very government they elected to serve them doing it to them.<p>I find the economics of such things very interesting in the side effects as much as the intended effects.",1422993282

I doubt it will ever go away because Microsoft will continue to keep some APIs close to the vest.<p>If it&#x27;s possible to transpile either Java source or better Java class files to a CLR assembly, even some of the community momentum that Java has might turn into a benefit for .NET, too.",1422993139

many years of experience in many technical areas. Have
contracted/consulted to multiple startups based in USA and India.
Earlier worked for large well-known US software product and Indian
software services companies.<p>Skills: Python, Linux, UNIX, many open source technologies, many
databases, XML-RPC, PDF programming (both PDF generation and PDF text
extraction), file and data format conversion, data munging,
command-line utility development, Flask, MongoDB, Bottle, SQLAlchemy, 
RESTful API design, implementation and use, git, mercurial (hg), SVN, 
various others. Worked a good amount on Ruby, Java and C earlier - 
somewhat rusty on them but can pick up / refresh again.<p>Worked on Ruby, Rails and Java earlier. Was server lead / senior
engineer for two commercial Rails-based dot-com products earlier, by
US companies. One of them was TaskBin - <a href=""http://taskbin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taskbin.com</a> .<p>Databases worked on: Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, Sybase,
Informix, SQLite, MS SQL Server. Used databases in most of the
projects I&#x27;ve worked on in my career. ORMs or similar: 
ActiveRecord with Ruby on Rails, SQLAlchemy with Python.<p>Worked on a best-selling retail banking product (earlier, in C with
proprietary DB and UI libs). Was team leader for a database middleware
product (in C) that was widely used in client projects by a top
software services company.<p>Did a lot of UNIX support and successful troubleshooting for years
(some years earlier), still have some of those skills, which are often
useful in development too. Had many times recovered clients&#x27; data from
corrupted file systems or crashed machines (with no backups :), using
various tricks of the trade learnt on the job, and solved various
other software problems, often involving various interacting software
components (from OS level through language compilers to application
programs and databases). Wrote many utilities in C and UNIX shell
tools (sed, awk, grep and friends) to automate various tasks (for both
users and developers), convert data between various formats from one
platform to another, etc. A nice example: writing a pair of programs - 
a Java servlet/HTML form and a UNIX C setuid program - that worked together 
to provide safe, controlled access with escalated privileges (of the DBA user) 
to developers via the browser.<p>Relevant links:<p>My Bitbucket account with my open source projects:<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/vasudevram"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/vasudevram</a><p>Biz site: <a href=""http://www.dancingbison.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dancingbison.com</a> (see Home, Products, Services,

8992703,comment,8990654,8992005,0,0,jamestnz,,,">All things behave this way. You were compelled to comment given your current circumstance, your particular makeup of cells and electricity sitting in your chair typing<p>This is an interesting comment I think, because if you take it far enough it ends up having implications for free will.<p>Consider the exercise described in this excerpt from a Sam Harris lecture on free will. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Xp7mvOcVM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Xp7mvOcVM</a> (only 14m long and quite fascinating). I&#x27;ll briefly describe the gist of it for non-video folks.<p>Exercise: Think of any city in the world. That&#x27;s it, just think of the name of a city. No limits or restrictions, any city from any country in the world, just pick one.<p>Having chosen one, consider WHY you chose the city you did. It might seem like your choice was utterly uncompelled by external factors; you specifically made a reasoned choice, or you engaged your whims, or you just went with the first one that popped into your mind, or whatever. In any case, the city you ultimately chose was completely up to your own free will. Right?<p>Well, we can quickly begin to narrow down the field of possible choices. For one, it&#x27;s clear that nobody who did the above exercise thought of a city that they&#x27;d never heard of. So for each person, the city they chose necessarily came from the set of cities they&#x27;d actually heard of. And even then, some filtering or selection &quot;algorithm&quot; is clearly happening behind the scenes, because there exist cities you&#x27;ve heard of, but which didn&#x27;t happen to occur to you at all just now.<p>So some cities would seem to have a higher or lower chance of coming to mind than others, based on factors unique to the individual. For example, a city someone just mentioned 5 minutes ago and you&#x27;re now thinking of, a city that&#x27;s been featuring in the news lately, or the cities you&#x27;ve personally lived in, or you made a memorable trip to once, or which are culturally fascinating to you, etc etc.<p>And then consider the actual process that occurred in your head when you started to choose your city. In general, thoughts and ideas largely just kinda &quot;occur&quot; to you, by some process that&#x27;s not under your conscious control. So in starting to think of a city, the names of some cities just started popping into your head. But what was controlling which cities were popping into your mind, and which weren&#x27;t? Obviously you can&#x27;t have consciously controlled this brainstorming process, because this would require you to have thought of the city before you thought of it.<p>So you wanted to think of a city, and your brain just started conjuring them into your conscious mind somehow. Since you didn&#x27;t consciously supervise which cities were popping to mind and which weren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s as if your brain is doing something like accessing your memories, experiences, prejudices, preferences, etc; and bringing cities into your mind by some automatic process that&#x27;s not consciously available to you.<p>But, what determines the list of cities that someone has heard of in their lifetime, and which have therefore made it into the brain to be available for this exercise? Well, many things that were never under your control to begin with. An obvious example: many people end up living much of their lives in the same city they were born. Which means at least one city is in your brain merely because your parents happened to give birth/raise you there, and the thought of moving away never occurred to you (or it did, but you stayed anyway). You don&#x27;t choose where you were born.<p>And as you say, <i>everything</i> works like this. So perhaps you thought of Rome because you had Italian food for lunch yesterday, therefore biasing yourself towards thinking of it. But then why did you make that particular lunch choice? Perhaps a coworker made the lunch decision that day, meaning the reason Rome just occurred to you was because of a decision your coworker made. Where&#x27;s the free will in that? Or perhaps you did decide lunch on your own that day. How did you go about this? Obviously by wanting to think of lunch options, and your brain started popping ideas into your head somehow....",1422991961

They rely on others around them. If you took a smart and capable person and transplanted them into a strange environment, they&#x27;d thrive after a short time finding traction. Take most everyone else out of their carefully-cultivated social milieu, and they&#x27;d fall flat on their face.<p>So smart and capable people will pooh-pooh the value of college because they don&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s doing for them. They&#x27;ll think of throwing themselves against the free market as the ultimate challenge, the great meritocratic equalizer. And for these people, it is.<p>For those that are not smart and capable, it is not.

Under Obama&#x27;s admin at least there was &quot;recovery.org - track the money&quot; and more accountability.<p>If republicans really want to cut government spending and deficits they should look into cutting the military budget. Not only does has it ballooned to take up nearly half of all non discretionary income, but apparently $7 TRILLION is unaccounted for. So until they do that, I don&#x27;t consider their &quot;platform&quot; anything but a talking point to bring up ONLY against Democratic presidents. (In some way, it&#x27;s good because it keeps them in check, but then republican presidents get a free ride from them.)<p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/want-cut-government-waste-8-5-trillion-pentagon-142321339.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/want-cut-governm...</a>",1422990424

If, for instance, you chose to speak only the word &quot;dude&quot;, you could probably still make yourself understood to any native speaker.<p>As English lacks punctuation modifiers for altering the context and intent of a written sentence, we accomplish that end through an expanded lexicon, wherein several is more than a few and less than a buttload, despite each word representing an unspecified quantity.<p>English is far more likely to invent a new word, filch one from another tongue, or reuse a previously disused English word with a new sense or different part of speech, than it is to recalibrate the ordering of synonyms on a continuum of intent.<p>&quot;Comprise&quot; and &quot;compose&quot; are inverse terms.  Using one when you mean the other initially generates confusion, and subsequently destroys the language model around composition.  The whole comprises the parts, and the parts compose the whole.  Passive voice is an inverting structure, so the whole is composed by the parts, and the parts are comprised by the whole.  Include is a weaker form of comprise, without the implication of completeness (except in legal writing, where that implication is the default, and comprise is not generally used).  But as the inverse of include is exclude, inclusion is more about membership in the set than about a level transition in the composition hierarchy.  A league comprises teams, and a team comprises players.  Yet a league does not comprise players; the league includes players.  This is how we describe things precisely and concisely.<p>Oral use is much more forgiving of misuse, as it has error-correcting code in the form of context and intonation.  Written use has a greater need for correctness, especially when such use is read by many, any of whom may repeat and propagate the error.<p>And I think parent post is incorrect.  When you transpose or rotate the meaning of a word onto the meaning of an existing word, English is poorer for it.  Once those meanings overlap, it is as difficult to separate them into different shades of meaning as it is to unlock gimbals.  Also, &quot;aught&quot; is the shortened version of &quot;naught&quot;, or zero, whereas &quot;ought&quot; is the synonym for &quot;should&quot; with a greater implication that the actor is obligated to perform, but not quite to the extent that he &quot;must&quot;.<p>Logicity is perfectly cromulent, though someone should elucidate the conditionals for when it would be preferacious to logicality.",1422990093

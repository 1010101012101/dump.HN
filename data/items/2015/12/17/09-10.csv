It requires additional effort to imagine what information might be required for somebody else to follow your train of thought. Think of code documentation: What the original author percieves as obvious is cryptic to somebody else because context has been omitted for the sake of brevity. The author needs to invest a lot of time to actually dump his entire mindstate into documentation. Even if he does make an effort, not everybody is a good writer. If he doesn&#x27;t care about others understanding his stuff (which also seems to be the case with Mochizuki) it gets even worse.<p>Also remember that Mochizuki basically worked alone on his stuff for 20 odd years. He built his own world to work in and it&#x27;s just as hard for collegues to catch up to his level in that world as it is for e.g. non-programmers to understand programming (which takes years).",1450345915

Missing mechanisms like memory protection, which are often called as a condition for multitasking, are system stability issues only. The MP/M operating system already proved, that multitasking on Z80 computers is possible.<p>While the MOS Technology 6502 can not move the stack, the Z80 can freely replace it to any position in the memory, which is more or less a condition for pre-emptive multitasking. The existance of an alternative register set accelerates the content switching between the tasks dramatically. The restriction of Z80 systems to a 64 kB address space can be solved with bank switching.

If it was correct, what would be point of doing science? Let&#x27;s face it - the point of science is to build models of reality. And every model (except of usage of the world in logic) by definition is a type of inductive reasoning about reality. The reason why we want to have models is to be able to predict situations where we don&#x27;t have control; for instance, we don&#x27;t want build two bridges that are to be used by people to see which one fails. So you&#x27;re pretty much rejecting inductive reasoning in that sentence.<p>The AGW theory, specifically, is not a fact (GW is a fact), it&#x27;s a <i>model</i> that tells us what&#x27;s gonna happen (conditionally on our emissions) with the planet. And you can believe it&#x27;s a good model even without having control (just like you can believe that a computer model of a bridge is a useful tool). For instance, because you understand laws of thermodynamics, and you can measure what greenhouse gas is.<p>(Oh, on 2nd reading, I understand where you&#x27;re coming from. Model is technically not a fact, fact is some observation. But I guess in common language, most of the things we call facts are actually models.)",1450344206

That&#x27;s weird.<p>* Selecting a specific DB (what I don&#x27;t really want to do) still shows me the wrong table list from a different DB. &#x27;Forget Schemas&#x27; does not work. Weirdly enough, I can query the DB I selected, it just won&#x27;t resolve the table names (and do autocomplete).<p>Though, it&#x27;s probably just me having this problem since there&#x27;s no way this would go through the testing phase.<p>EDIT2: The price is also way too much in my opinion. It basically costs as much as PHPStorm. Not sure why you would by DataGrip instead of Navicat.",1450342808

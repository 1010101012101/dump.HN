This worries me BIG TIME! I think that Google needs to maybe revist this new functionaliy, and re-think it’s rollout….and make a change to allow us to filter our own use of this tool…for us and for ours….\nWhat do you think?</i><p>I think that the author is correct in that real-time results can easily lead to gaming the google search results even more than they are currently being gamed. However I think the all-caps, exclamation points, and child predators are a bit much.<p>The problem is that Google is struggling to remain relevant as the web moves increasingly to more dynamic content. Google was built on a system of ranking static content -- without some kind of metadata filtering the web was simply too much for people to understand back in 98. It's simply not enough to grab all the dynamic stuff you can out there and throw it at the users.<p>Google can't be just about data, even though that's what they want. It's much more important for them to rank data than simply collect it. That's what made them strong in the first place.",1260640390

A unionized company could be very well or badly run, depending on the management. It's the management that hires the workers and decide what they should be doing after all.<p>A union helps both the workers and the company because without the company, the workers (and the union) would no longer be needed.

What will you do and how will you live while you are training to join another profession?<p>Starting a business is difficult, you can ask all the people here how much work they have to put into it. What if you don't have the skills to manage a business or to market a product? Not only that, but where do you get the capital from? VCs? Banks? You have to beg them and do a song and dance to get any money from them. Then you have to keep doing that while you remain unprofitable so that the business keeps on running.<p>What if every employer offers contracts that are crappy in one way or another? What do you do then? Choose the lesser of a million evils? Why should you do that when you can bargain and possibly get a better contract?<p>A union is as paternalistic as the state or the corporation. So if you have no problem with those, groups of people co-operating to achieve something, then you shouldn't have a problem with a union. Maybe the word has a negative connotation for you, we can change that easily. Let's call it XYZ or some other word instead.",1260640244

991729,comment,991555,991555,0,0,cschwarm,,,"I assume you meant promotion; the term marketing usually includes product (design), price, placement (ie. distribution) and promotion.<p>Making marketing decisions is basically the same thing as making any decision: You need to determine your goal, identify barriers you need to overcome in order to reach that goal, and then execute.<p>The difference to technical decision is identifying the barriers. With technical problems, the relevant cause of the barrier, namely the object or software, is under your control and easy to alter. It's also easy to measure the effects of any change. Thus, identifying barriers is rather easy.<p>With promotional decisions, the cause of the barrier is basically the market, that is: some group of people. They are not under your control, altering their behavior is usually very hard, and measurement is an art form since you often don't know who they are. Therefore, identifying the relevant barriers is often a mix of experience, intuition, and guesswork.<p>Of course, there are lists of common barriers (ie. causes why people don't buy or buy elsewhere) and for each of them, there are common methods to overcome (or answer) these.<p>For example, a game is a typical experience good: you can only judge the value after having played (and payed for) the game. Thus, mistrust is a likely barrier to overcome. Typical answers are offering a trial, a demo or a guarantee, setting the price to zero, etc. -- the ""low commitment"" route. A different route could be using ""high-reward"" signals: promoting the (high) production costs, setting a rather high price, producing high-quality in-game videos, buying TV time for ads, offering trials to only selected journalists, etc.<p>As you can see from the example, money may be a necessary ingredient, sometimes lots of it. Thus, promotion is also a function of the price (or rather, the revenue model).<p>However, since you seem to go the ""low commitment"" route, already, your central problem will be ""selection"": Why play your game instead of one of the million others?<p>A common answer is ""relating"" or ""bounding"" -- appeal to something a target audience wants to be (or thinks it is). For example, Listerine's 'Always a bridesmaid, never a bride' appealed to what the audience wanted to be (namely someone's wife). Marlboro's 'Come to Marlboro country' appealed to freedom and independence. So, another ingredient is creativity, so to say.<p>If you have that, your promotion only needs to communicate this particular trait. The rest is finding out what people do, view or read who should be interested in this particular trait and go for it.<p>Then, you really just need time and effort to promote your product successfully.<p>Hope this helps.",1260639688

My certain answer is No. But that only drives me to learn more and work harder.<p>I spend time reading about Algorithms and Lisp and SICP and what have you. I spend time reading a lot of open source code, and writing a lot (both at work and in my spare time). I engage in conversations with those who are way smarter and experienced than I (both in person, and online - BTW HN is a great resource) hoping to find that one nugget of information that I can use.<p>To answer your question - See if it really ""takes"" over you. See if you find a thrill in making a computer bend to your wishes. See if technology really ""tickles"" you. Programming is for the most part about figuring things out. And that involves figuring out why things don't work. Yes, there is that tingling excitement when what you wanted to happen happens, but a large part of programming is debugging and maintenance, reading documentation and exiting (and often pretty badly done) existing source code.<p>How long did it take for me to learn? I doubt I will ever be done. Programmers, at least the good ones are constantly learning. Books, blogs, online forums, in-person discussions and your own experiments.<p>I don't think there is an age limit to learning it, but my experience has been that for people like me, it's a struggle (YMMV). I know there are things I don't know, and discussions like those at HN are very humbling. I am constantly trying to ""catch"" up with those that have more experience, but that's not a bad thing. It keeps me on my toes.<p>My take on this - Dig in something that gets you going quickly. Someone suggested JavaScript, I would recommend something like Ruby or Clojure. Buy a book, fire up your text editor and start writing. You can soon upgrade to one of the classics like Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs to a get a good foundation, and take it from there.<p>[Update - Sorry, I did not realize how long that was. My apologies if that comes across as a rant, it's not. I hope it helps]",1260638458

The unions can't run the company for you, management has to do it. The unions made sure the employees got paid enough to do their work. Whether or not it was the <i>right</i> work to do was up to management.<p>Also, banks and insurance companies got far larger loans than the US auto industry: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program#Participants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program#P...</a><p>The unions wanted to keep the auto workers employed and that's kind of hard to do when the companies go to shit (mainly because of management).

Why not just let them all fail?<p>So yeah, I would say the union works pretty well for auto industry workers.

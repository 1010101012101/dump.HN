All of these firms want to jump straight into VC introductions, so I would imagine most of this money would go towards the legal work associated with raising a Series A.<p>Regarding incorporation, do you have any suggestions as where to start?<p>Thanks for responding.",1188881600

But this guy really has his head up his arse.  <p>Just b/c you live in San Francisco does not mean that you get to know the 49ers plays before they're run.  Just b/c you have an apple computer doesn't mean you get to know what features they're releasing next.  Just b/c you're a US citizen does not mean that you should have carte-blanche insight into the military and intelligence communties.  Secrecy is an important factor in any competition and geo-politics is most certainly a competition. <p>If he were making the argument that somehow the world is better off knowing the location of our continuity of gov't facilities or the names of our Case Officers (they're not called CIA agents) that would be one thing.  But he says that there should be ""no secrets.""  This implies that there should be no competition or that he wants to loose the competitions.  Like it or not, we could shut down our entire military and intel services and not a single country would follow suit.  <p>Also posting names of Case Officers can expose their sources and get them killed in the most brutal possible ways.  These sources are often dissidents of the most oppressive regimes and they feed us information at great personal risk.  I doubt Mr. Young would still do what he did if he looked into the eyes of a dissident whose family just got gunned down in some anonymous basement.  <p>I would say he is a traiter but I think he's just ignoarant.

What about Java? Are any of you using Java at your startup to develop your software infrastructure? If you are not, did you consider it in the beginning? what influenced your specific choice. <p>What about Dynamic languages written for Java such as Groovy or ColdFusion? ",1188880726

General public kind of needs them right now, but as a society we shall learn to live without such dependence.<p>P.S. I am a long time AdBlock Plus user and we incorporated its filters (not code) into our own software that performs the same function in IE6&7.",1188880709

I just imagined some set of images that I was supposed to compare for appealingness, and then have a hidden set of answers I could compare to; that would demonstrate it pretty strongly for me, without having any power of suggestion involved.

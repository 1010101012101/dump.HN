This would eliminate the possibility that your users are sharing passwords for their accounts.<p>Also, the way I would intend on using this is such that if your public key is in authorized_keys, you log in like normal.  If not, you authenticate with PAM using both your unix password (or ldap or whatever you have configured) and your 2nd authentication system.

I just got my first Android not too long ago and haven't hacked it yet, so it didn't occur to me that the modding community was achieving their goals by defeating Android's security model.<p>With F-Droid, if they were to just distribute preexisting APKs that correspond to free/open-source software  like your TextSecure APK  it sounds like it would have your signature on it, and updates wouldn't be a problem. But they compile the apps themselves to let you be ""absolutely sure the binary package[..] is identical to the source"". So ironically, they're actually adding a kind of <i>security</i> feature, and it is this that takes away your ability to provide updates (they might say by design, since you could otherwise push a closed-source update to their users).<p>Theoretically that problem could be avoided if you signed the source code, F-Droid distributed that, and any necessary compilation was done directly on the smartphone. I suppose this is impractical, but such a setup might work on Mozilla's forthcoming Firefox OS where all the apps are written in HTML5/JS. Just as long as you signed a non-minified copy of the code, it wouldn't be an issue.<p>On the other hand, I think the problem with updates, if we're continuing the F-Droid/Debian analogy, really comes down to how much you can trust the ""distro"". I use Ubuntu on my desktop and if there's (say) a Firefox vulnerability, the security update for that will come from, and be signed by, Ubuntu, not Mozilla. And it works because I trust Ubuntu. They monitor high-profile applications like Firefox and if a fix is needed, they'll ship it ASAP. Whereas, the F-Droid people were apparently not watching TextSecure closely enough, and either didn't notice there was a new release, or couldn't be bothered to update their copy in a timely manner. I'm not convinced their model is inherently insecure; it just requires I put my trust in them rather than in you (in this case perhaps a questionable decision).",1346207740

This is dangerous.<p>Here's the scenario, that in a conventional update-oriented store, is termed as a ""lost update"". ""A"" reads object.v1, ""B"" reads the same version, ""B"" adds a fact to the object making it v2, then ""A"" comes along and writes obj.v3 based on its own _stale_ knowledge of the object. In effect, it has clobbered what ""B"" wrote, because A's write came later and has become the latest version of the object. The fact that DAtomic's transactor serialized writes is meaningless because it doesn't take into account read dependency.<p>In other words, DAtomic gives you an equivalent of Read-committed or snapshot isolation, but not true serializability. I wouldn't use it for a banking transaction for sure.  To fix it, DAtomic would need to add a test-and-set primitive to implement optimistic concurrency, so that a client can say, ""process this write only if this condition is still true"". Otherwise, two clients are only going to be talking past each other.",1346207060

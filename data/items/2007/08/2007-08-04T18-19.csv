39362,comment,39337,39337,0,0,keith_erskine,,,"Social networking, like a lot of other business segments, is starting to encompass lots of other companies doing similar things. Increasingly, social networking is about finding people with similar interests, backgrounds, or personal attributes (race, religion, disease/disability) and getting them to talk/share stuff with each other. What's driving startups is that they're going after specific groups/markets in the hope of getting enough of them together so they click on an ad every once and a while on the web site. <p>The best example I can think of that goes after a specific group is Dogster. Dogster was started as a joke by someone who created the site over a weekend (at least that's the story I heard). Much to the designer's surprise, people really wanted to talk with other people about their dogs. Dogster has since raised some money and is getting revenue from sponsorships. Woof!<p>Increasingly, people/groups will just put these networks together themselves instead of relying on a business to do it for them. Ning has been working hard and has a bunch of social networks already up and running. They make it easy for people to put together all the components (forums, photo albums, video, etc.).<p>Plug: Mobile Monday Boston will be having its next meeting on Sept. 17 to discuss mobile social networking. A number of companies will be presenting (including mine - padpaw.net). ",1186253269

I thought everyone knew that we were moving towards more processors instead of faster processors. <p>One quote that I didn't particularly like, ""You can imagine a scenario where people stop buying laptops and PCs because we can't figure this out.""  Yeah, I'm sure <i>that</i> is going to happen.  All it means is that new ambitious groups of people have a good chance of entering the market against entrenched competitors who do not go with a parallel design.<p>They also mention, ""...operating systems like Windows XP and Vista already work with the multicore chips out now,"" as if Windows is the only one that does.  Linux and BSD systems (among others) have been working with multiple processors since long before Windows even considered the idea of having multiple users.<p>Overall, I wasn't impressed with the reporting. I think it's partly uninformed (failing to recognize the history and present-day of SMP systems and programs), sensationalist (declaring impending doom when there's really no chance of it), and quite late (I thought people had been considering SMP for a while now).<p>I'm also disappointed in the guy they're quoting (David Patterson from Berkeley), who appears to be out of touch with what is going on in the software world.  He says, ""We need to get some Manhattan Projects going here - somebody could solve this problem, and whoever solves this problem could have this gigantic advantage on everybody else.""  From my perspective, Erlang and several functional languages already ""solve this problem"" quite well, and there is a slew of multi-processor programs out there already which seem to be doing quite fine.<p>Am I missing something here?",1186253112
39360,story,,,1,2,rokhayakebe,"At which point do you quit? (dumb your idea)",,"Is there a point at which you feel as if you needed to quit? I am working on two projects and at times I want to quit one and focus on the other, but I do not know which one to pick. Anyways most of the time I am very very confident that I will ""make something people want"", but there is that 5% of doubt that hovers. When do you  know you need to dumb one idea and focus on something else?",1186252669
39359,comment,39337,39342,0,0,diabloernest,,,"I agree that people are lazy. The user acquisition by these new social networks is far more intrusive. Asking for gmail, linkedin, yahoo, your-favourite-mail-app passwords, and then spamming all. i receive 5 such invitations daily, which are part of intrusive practices. With this, they build up users and seek more funding, giving a false impressions that they are ""popular"" amongst people. <p>They should improve features, but as of now , features are not visible. Most of them are just theme based social networks. Which makes me inquisitive about the number of social networks each user joins on an average.",1186252660

There's a long list of features that Gmail just can't match that come from being a desktop app.<p>Hard drives transfer data faster than ISP's in the first place, and why have a hard drive if you're not going to use it?",1186250903
39355,comment,39301,39330,0,0,aston,,,"I thought it was the other way around: never try to solve a social problem with software.<p>The karma-neutral idea sounds like a good one, but then you remember that it's easy to create new accounts... Ultimately, you just have to depend on people to do good or leave.",1186250628

It hasn't been needed so far, and may never be because of Startup News's narrow focus.<p>If I reuse the code to make a general news site, as I've been thinking I might, I'll certainly turn it on.",1186250475

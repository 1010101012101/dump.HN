Now that computers are near-ubiquitous, it's easier than ever for an individual to create or modify software to perform the specific tasks they want done -- and more important than ever that they be able to do so. But a single software patent can put up an insurmountable, and unjustifiable, legal hurdle for many would-be developers.<p>The Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled in favor of the patentability of software. Their decision in Bilski v. Kappos further demonstrates that they expect the boundaries of patent eligibility to be drawn more narrowly than they commonly were at the case's outset. The primary point of the decision is that the machine-or-transformation test should not be the sole test for drawing those boundaries. The USPTO can, and should, exclude software from patent eligibility on other legal grounds: because software consists only of mathematics, which is not patentable, and the combination of such software with a general-purpose computer is obvious.",1285606792

1732328,comment,1731699,1731699,0,0,mipnix,,,"I flew for the airlines.<p>The problem is not your everyday takeoff and landing. The problem arises when the weather deteriorates to near zero visibility and the crew is relying on instrumentation to find that strip of pavement, at 130 knots.<p>Instrument approaches rely on a narrowing volume of radio signals, the closer one is to the runway. The tighter the signal, therefore, the greater the deviation should something go wrong. Think of threading a string through a funnel, if you touch the edges, you lose. Now do it on a trampoline while someone else jumps on it. I assume we can all agree that wildly porpoising a 200k lb jet, 400 from the ground, chasing a signal, is not a good idea.<p>Vehicles on the ground are prevented from encroaching on the approach signal area, when aircraft are shooting approaches in reduced visibility conditions, to prevent them for interrupting the signal. In the cockpit you can see your signals fluctuate if someone does cross that threshold. It happens.<p>When visibility is good, it is a non event but when you can't see jack, having your guidance just start dancing around, gives one moments of pause.<p>The phones do interfere in some manner. TO what degree, I can't say. I have forgotten to turn my phone off before takeoff and get the annoying beep in the headset when we descend into an area with coverage, so something is going on.<p>The reason they ask you to turn it off is because they can't tell you its okay, because they haven't tested it. They can't say, well turn it off if it's cloudy or if the bases are below 300'. Some departures and arrivals require precise navigation, even in good weather, for traffic flow reasons. Missing a fix on departure or arrival could cause traffic alerts or aircraft deviations.<p>All rules exist for the worst possible scenario. Not the milk run. But how do you explain that to the traveling masses? You should be more concerned with the fact those little dixie cup oxygen masks they instruct you to put on in the event of a decompression, won't actually supply you with oxygen when the shit hits the fan at altitude. It's a partial pressure thing.<p>That's just between you and me...<p>Edit: At the end of the day, it is the law. If the crew is having a bad day and has a stick up their ass, they can make your day a lot worse. You need to ask yourself, does ignoring the rule, no matter how inane you think it is, really make a body cavity search worth checking the latest XKCD update?",1285606623

Take buying a car at a dealership, refinancing your house, or anything else involving a lower-level salesman.  They make absurd statements which benefit their cause if I believe them.<p>Last week, I was talking to a mortgage salesman affiliated with my financial advisor (who I think is pretty smart).  The mortgages rates offered are about 0.25% lower \n with a ""point"" (percentage of loan amount) paid up-front.  One can compute the approximate (<i>) length of time the loan must be held for this to be a good deal.  This guy, without any knowledge of how long I expected to stay in my home, said, ""I never put people into points....you gotta pay all that money up front, you know?""<p>Was he being dishonest? I don't think his commission varied much depending on which product he sold me, and he seemed legitimately interested in forming a longer-term relationship rather than making a sale that day.  When I mentioned that the point of indifference was probably around two and a half years and that I planned to stay in the house, he backed off of his claim.<p>I suspect he was just not .too sharp but perhaps realized that, when confronted with too many confusing mortgage choices, many people would just choose irrationally not to refinance.  If someone chooses to buy nothing, he gets no commission.  Maybe he was smart enough to want to reduce the number of choices for me to consider.  And, when confronted with the need to cough up a percent of their homes' values, many people might back out of deals, so he decided to eliminate choices which might not pan out in his favor.<p>I have taken the adage ""Never presume malevolence for what can be explained by stupidity."" to heart and try to react in such situations with the presumption of stupidity.  It's really hard though when I can't figure out how someone could actually believe the things he's saying.  After all, shouldn't someone who spends his days selling mortgages understand the trade-off of paying a point down up-front for a lower rate?<p>(</i>) I don't know how the average person figures out which mortgage product is best.

I am seeing a growing number of people register on my site and with that a larger number of rejected emails because they entered the email wrong.  (Note: who ever owns gmial.com probably sees a ton of email sent their way).  This made me rethink how people get registered.  I think it is probably time to change gears and validate the email and not the password.  Sure doing both would be better but I dislike having to double enter everything on a form.<p>Here is my rational for making the switch.  I want users to become engaged.  The fact that they are registering means I did something right that motivated them to act.  I require, like many others, to validate their email and account by clicking on a link that gets emailed to them.  If they never get the link they never get fully registered.    I am sure a large number of users would not follow up on this.  They were motivated at the time to register but that motivation might not be strong enough to persuade them to troubleshoot their registration.  This results in turning a motivated user into a disgruntled surfer.<p>Plus if the password was wrong they can always reset it with their validated and confirmed email",1285605343

(He made detailed plans but never actually built it.)<p>20 decimal places is about 64 bits. One design for a 64x64->128 multiplier is described in <a href=""http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5912832/description.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5912832/description.html</a> and takes about 33k gates to achieve a propagation delay of about 200 gates. I'm not sure what propagation delays are like on modern CPUs; let's suppose it's 20ps per gate, so that a modern-silicon multiplier can do a 4ns multiply in 33k gates. How much space should we think of that as taking up? Not just the volume of the gates themselves; we need some volume for circuit boards, cooling, power supply, etc., etc., etc. A small modern PC might be a litre in volume and contains maybe the equivalent of 200M gates (CPU, memory, whatever else). So 33k gates corresponds to maybe 1/600 of a litre. So, in volume per unit power, modern technology beats Ludgate's version of the analytical engine by maybe a factor of (230 x 6) / (1/600 x 4x10^-9) or about 2x10^14.<p>(Don't take this too seriously; there are a lot of very dubious assumptions in the above.)<p>Now, let's say Google has 10^5 machines occupying 1 litre each. The equivalent in analytical engines would be 2x10^19 litres, or 2x10^16m^3.<p>The radius of the earth is about 6.4 x 10^6 m, so its surface area is 4 pi r^2 ~= 5x10^14 m^2. About 1/3 of this is land, so let's say 2x10^14 m^2. So we'd need to cover the land area of the earth 100m deep in analytical engines.<p>Dubious assumptions or not, I think I agree with your guess.",1285603766

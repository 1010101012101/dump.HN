7632180,comment,7631542,7632012,1,0,nemothekid,,,"For elite schools atleast, I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with watering down their standards. These schools have the pick of the crop and if 3.3million high school students graduate in the US alone every year, the top 1% of students make up about 33,000 applicants, far more than the 2000 or so Harvard admitted in last year.<p>The issue really morphs from &quot;How do I select the best students for my school?&quot; to &quot;What sort of arbitrary metrics can I use to filter down this list of already amazing students?&quot; If I had to guess however, I&#x27;d say these schools, under the guise of character, are trying to select students that have the highest potential to give back to the university. &quot;Oh this student does part-time acting? Well we will accept her on the chance she becomes the next Natalie Portman. This guy has a best selling app? Better put him on the list of potential Zuckerbergs.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not an admissions officer (not even close), but that would be my best guess on what someone an admissions officer would do faced with the problem of having so many amazing students to fill their undergrad class 10 times over. At some point it no longer makes sense to filter on raw academic ability (see also, Google&#x27;s &quot;GPA does not matter&quot;), and a purely random lottery would 1.) never actually be a random lottery (thank you alumni) and 2.) may massively favor one group of people (if I have to choose 2000 our of 33,000, and 60% of that 33,000 are asian from a 150,000k+ income family, you run the risk of homogenous class - if you have to ask whats wrong with this, consider this, would you like to work at a job that hired exclusively white men (or whatever race/gender you are)).<p>Another way to look at it would be this way: if you were given the task to hire a new team of software engineers, and once the resume&#x27;s came in they all had, 3.9+ college GPAs, Ph.ds in CS, and multiple years of experience on your tech stack of choice, would you just &quot;do a pure lottery&quot; to see who works for your company? Chances are you might end up filtering them on the most circumstantial of metrics (i.e. &quot;This guy was a Yankees fan, I don&#x27;t think we would get along very well&quot;)",1398228967

I end up heating the water on my stove and dumping it in just so it doesn&#x27;t take an hour, and then it&#x27;s slower (albeit better and more fool proof) than traditional poaching. I found out the hard way that trying to cook a girl breakfast to impress her doesn&#x27;t work, no matter how awesome your marinara and poached eggs with salsa verde are, if it takes a freaking hour and a half. That&#x27;s why I decided that if I built a unit, it would just have a timer. I&#x27;d wake up to the water heated, then put the eggs in. The actual poaching is as fast as you can get everything else ready anyway.<p>Also I am a night owl and often not awake 12 hours before dinner time, so it&#x27;d be good in that case.<p>I was thinking about it for professional use though.

7632113,comment,7626166,7631535,1,0,dalke,,,"My apologies. I did overlook your mention of a heat exchanger as being the requirement for a power reactor.<p>To me a heat exchanger is something which moves heat from one medium to the other, and is not necessarily part of power production. The radiator in a car is a heat exchanger, and not a power generator. Thus, I did not understand your viewpoint.<p>Quoting from the first link you gave: &quot;Pumped through a heat exchanger, that hot lead will help generate steam just like a conventional thermal power plant&quot;. Thus, I consider it as not a power plant, because it only produces steam. While I see that you consider the production of steam to be sufficient, likely because it reduces the issue to a previously solved problem.<p>I am satisfied that the General Fusion design, which hasn&#x27;t even started, is not a nuclear fusion power plant of the sort that Asimov predicted would be available by 2014. That is my primary interest in this discussion.<p>FWIW, after more looking around, I found this quote from <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/414559/a-new-approach-to-fusion/page/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/news/414559/a-new-approach-t...</a> :<p>> However, if the company can pull off its test reactor, it hopes to attract enough attention to easily raise the $500 million for a demonstration power plant.<p>Note how that magazine author also distinguishes between &quot;test reactor&quot; and &quot;demonstration power plant&quot;?<p>The information I found are not sufficient to make the estimates that you mentioned. For example, while I found pictures of the small sphere experimental setup, and a mention that the final velocity is 50 m/s, I did not find learn the mass of the piston, or equivalently the amount of power used to drive it. Nor did I find out how much power goes into the plasma injectors. There are images of some pretty hefty capacitor banks, but I couldn&#x27;t tell if they are discharged at once, or if they are rotated through in order to lengthen the charge time for any one bank of capacitors.<p>Estimating the pumping needs is very complicated. I found no reference of what the internal surface of the sphere looks like. If liquid extends into each piston then there well be turbulence at each interface, causing power loss. Even if it&#x27;s laminar, I still need to know the rotational speed.<p>The depictions I&#x27;ve seen show that the lead surface is a near cylinder, which means a very high speed, as the natural shape of a rotating fluid is a parabola. Assuming 0.25 meter radius for the upper part of the cylinder and a height of 3 meters gives 400-500 Hz. That seems rather a lot, given that they&#x27;re talking about some 50 cubic meters of lead, or 500 tons, moving at some 2,000 m/s.<p>(I used the equation for a liquid mirror telescope: h = 1/(2g) * (omega * r) ^ 2. Hopefully I didn&#x27;t calculate it incorrectly.)<p>Since the information I&#x27;ve found doesn&#x27;t make sense, either my math is wrong, or the information I&#x27;ve found is incomplete. Since you are the one who believes that this is a near-term power plant, then surely you must have worked out these details already, or read them some place. That is, how fast is the molten lead mixture supposed to rotate, and how much energy is needed to keep it at that speed?",1398227540

There&#x27;s a fundamental problem with the oculus rift and video content: in order to prevent VR sickness, you need at least enough of a 3d scene to enable head movements within a small volume. Because traditional cameras, including binocular cameras, don&#x27;t capture a true 3d scene this is impossible. 3d from a camera in the rift will be as bad as the current 3d displays.<p>But the Lytro can capture an actual 3d scene right? So maybe the Lytro is the perfect companion to the oculus rift. The field of view will be limited (like looking through a window) but at least it will be true 3d and could respond correctly to head movements!",1398226418

It was built with logs much too big to be from the Yukon though, so I think it must have been something important for them to import logs like that (likely from just down the road in Alaska). Which is confusing, because it wasn&#x27;t on any important routes like you expect to find on, say, the Yukon river, or big lakes up here.<p>Judging from the materials, recent improvements and nails, books, clothes, stove, etc, I then suspect sometime in the 90&#x27;s someone moved in for a summer and did a ton of work. New window shutters (built with screws indicating a cordless drill), new floorboards with paint, roof work, etc. etc. Also they conveniently left a bunch of brand new sheets of plywood and 2x4s out of the weather, and many thousands of nails. The only &quot;visitors message&quot; was from &#x27;98, written in pencil, which was conveniently left in a tin of nails for use in construction.<p>The door was very solid and clearly bolted and locked in many places long ago - the thing about locked doors on cabins in the Yukon is they tend to get smashed in by people, as this one had been. People up here prefer cabins be left unlocked so they can be used in emergencies in the winter (when it&#x27;s -40) so 99.9% of cabins are not locked, and simply have a book that says &quot;please use this cabin and treat it as your own - also leave a note in the guest book if you like&quot;. It&#x27;s a great sense of community. So the door had been smashed in and was lying under a couple of feet of snow. The first night I was busy with everything else, so I just nailed up a sheet of plastic over the door in an attempt to make it air-tight. (I brought the plastic with me, having been told the cabin was a wreck)<p>After I dug out the door and got all the snow/ice off it, It was easy to line up the hinges and put a couple of big nails through to get it hanging right. It&#x27;s possible it was knocked in by a bear (not common, but it happens), though I didn&#x27;t see any evidence to suggest that.<p>Bears are awake now, but I didn&#x27;t see any or any evidence of them yet this spring, and I covered ~40km on snowshoes<p>All in all, as you might be able to tell, it&#x27;s a great sense of adventure to go to remote rivers and lakes and simply explore :)  I&#x27;m working through the photos now, I&#x27;ll post back here when they&#x27;re online so you can see what I&#x27;m talking about.",1398225983

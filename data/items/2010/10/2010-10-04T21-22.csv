Federal law extends this protection of religion into the commercial sphere by preventing employers from discriminating on the basis of religion (unless it is a religious organization, or the employee's religion would somehow interfere with the job).<p>""an especially funny one considering that the churches were the main driving force behind the Prohibition, yet carved out an exception for themselves.""<p>Prohibition is an interesting case, as it was actually one religious group (low-church Protestants) lobbying for it over the objections of another (Catholics and some high-church Protestants).",1286229480

There's nothing revelatory in any of this: go in prepared, have a fallback plan, don't buckle under to crazy demands. There is some interesting stuff about real estate brokering in there, which I found interesting, but which can easily distract from what the author is actually trying to discuss.<p>I read Trump's first book ""The Art of the Deal"" right after, and I think Trump's book does a better job of doing the same thing with much more interesting stories. First of all, Trump's arena is New York City real estate, which is more dramatic than Missouri real estate. Second, Trump talks about the actual personalities and organizations he dealt with, rather than the cutesy pseudonyms that the Intimidation author uses and the generic locales he describes. Third, Trump, for all his faults, comes off as a real guy with real ways (good or bad) of dealing with business problems, where the Intimidation author is mostly creating a hammed-up and semi-ficitional account of his modest deals.<p>Bottom line: ""Winning Through Intimidation"" is ok if you get it from the library, and you enjoy watered-down business parables. ""Art of the Deal"" is much better if you care about how someone who did some pretty spectacular things describes how he did them (which may or may not be wholly accurate).",1286229465

There are two things here that make me question the premise of the narrative (that there is an unwritten rule of business that a poor man is undeserving of making money):<p>1. the lender is characterized as a greedy man, who has made a killing from the financial misfortunes of others. I really can't tell if he is describing an individual, or someone who is actually an employee of a bank, and does no more than personify the accumulated earnings of the shareholders. Maybe wealthy and unscrupulous individuals write mortgages, and if not, bank employees are hardly known for their spiritual generosity; but it seems like he's taking a loan officer's assertions about professional ethics as a personal insult.<p>2. tactical shenanigans aside, the basic business model of lending money is that one collects a rent on the amount at risk. I know, fractional reserve bankers lend out many times more than they have on deposit, so it's easy money...but then so is insurance until the time comes to pay out. A broker's risk is virtually nil, the work being essentially a matter of selection and compliance with various administrative requirements - at least, I've not heard of any brokers being asked to make good on mortgages gone sour.<p>So while I have nothing against his making a good income, it seems to me that the lender's complaint has more to do with the broker jacking up the costs he will be passing on to his client, towards whom he supposedly has a fiduciary duty (and not incidentally, slightly increasing the risk borne by the lender), even though he is not providing any discernable increase in value to the client. The lender finds himself an unwilling competitor in a race to the bottom; he may refuse to do business with this broker, but a less scrupulous lender can be found who will, resulting in an opportunity cost if he sticks up for the person on the other end of the transaction (with whom he cannot deal directly). Rejecting the proposal of someone he views as an unethical middleman results in an economic disadvantage for no discernible gain, and in contravention of his fiduciary duty to maximize the potential earnings of his own investors.<p>I'm not saying that such is inevitably the case, just that that's how it looks on the limited information supplied.",1286228681

Ditching copyright and patent would allow an awful lot of small business trade to open up.<p>Sure, we can trim government on some ""constitutionality"" basis, and end up with a balanced budget and not have an income tax.

Everyone here can work out which of these is worth more than others, even though there's a strong chance that any of these bets could ""turn out"" worthless.<p>The problem is that options are harder to value: there are many more result scenarios and the math is a little more complicated.  As a result, many people opt out of doing the math entirely, and they think either ""it's basically worthless"" or ""it's basically money in the bank.""<p>The latter error is much worse than the former, but here are two consequences of the former: (1) one is less likely to work at a startup which might (in reality) be the best choice, and (2) if one is working at a startup, one's less likely to be nearly as alert to the risks and targets that may make the option worth less or more (at least as a probabilistic matter).  The latter is why the options are a win-win for the company and employee.<p>By the way, I do understand that different people have different tolerances for risk and for different kinds of risk.  But even if someone is biased very heavily towards low-risk situations (which is perfectly fine), it's best to do the math, understand the risk/reward profile of the option and then apply that against your own risk tolerance.",1286228573

However, even amongst mathematicians, you will see something of an avoidance to associate math with science.  Math is a framework of a sort, a way to think.  When we are talking about how to think, we are talking about philosophy.  Science has its own roots in philosophy, so it is not surprising that we see some grey areas here.<p>So let me rephrase it a little... When you learn Computer Science, you learn how to think.<p>People compare CS with engineering disciplines, but we find that there are a lot of methodology salesmen but few magic bullets.  The problem with comparing computer programming (the practical side of CS) to engineering is that programming is very difficult to measure.  We graduated from the idea of measuring lines of code.  We have not figured out how to accurately measure a technique like TDD.  We have an idea that code quality can rise when people pay attention to it, when people <i>think</i> about the problem; we can encourage this with code reviews, but we can do the same by encouraging developers to have a good night's sleep.  We have conjured approximations for our measurements, but none of this has quite the feel of engineering.  We are not building bridges, complete with a starting plan based on knowns and an execution.<p>Algorithms are not building blocks.  They are possible solutions to specific problems.  There is more than one solution, and the algorithms our professors taught us come with trade-offs.  Recently on HN, there was an excellent article and discussion on the trade-off made by grep to improve string searches.<p>So you cannot just pick from your handy dandy book of algorithms, fit them together in a programming jigsaw, and expect results.  The world of software is soft; requirements change, and systems change.  It is extremely flexible in a way that other, more physical entities, such as bridges, are not.<p>In addition to thinking of CS as a philosophy, I favor thinking of CS as an art.  I am communicating something to the computer, certainly, but in order to ensure that my code can be picked up by others or myself a year down the line, I must also dive into aesthetics.  The code must be readable.  It must make sense, must describe the problem, be expressed in such a way that humans can derive meaning from it.  Thus is CS as much about beautiful design as it is about getting results.",1286226512

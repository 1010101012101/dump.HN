As for programming languages used,  Java has been the mainstream for over 10 years now and C/C++ is still hanging tough after breaking into higher education 20+ years ago.<p>In &#x27;96-&#x27;99, the core courses I took (Data Structures, OS, Compilers, Computer Arch, etc.) served me well and I was glad to get a mix of Java and C/C++ at the time.  If I was starting my undergrad today however, I&#x27;d be a little disappointed to know not much had changed since then.  I&#x27;d argue a good bit of the curriculum is nearing its shelf life or, to carry on the spoiling food metaphor, at least needs to be put in the freezer for preservation.<p>Got me thinking about how things could evolve.  Some examples:<p>Data Structures => Javascript or some other web-able Ruby that 70% of folks will actually get a job in.  The concepts are what matter in DS, but while we are at it how about a more relevant language choice?  Points to those school already using Python for this!<p>Operating Systems => Teach it in C still, keep it hardcore low level, and probably make it an elective for the minority of folks who want to do performance OS work.<p>&quot;Browser/Internet as the OS&quot; => Replace the traditional core OS class; class project would basically be this: http://runtimejs.org/<p>Databases => Replace with a new core course for &quot;Data Science&quot;; make Databases an elective.<p>So, how would you evolve modern computer science curriculum if you could?",1404320190

7978055,comment,7977167,7977424,3,0,sdevlin,,,"> You need 16 million connections with 1GB of data, _in_ _each_ _connection_ to practically attack RC4.<p>This isn&#x27;t accurate.<p>There are two major attacks described in the recent literature on RC4.<p>The first targets single-byte biases in RC4. Simply: the distribution of key stream bytes at a given index is biased across all keys. By collecting a large number of ciphertext samples, you can match the bias in the ciphertext to the known biases in the key stream to recover plaintext.<p>These biases are only significant early in the key stream, say the first 256 bytes or so. Because they&#x27;re only prevalent early in the key stream, you need to make a lot of connections.<p>This attack isn&#x27;t a great fit if your target is a user&#x27;s HTTP session, for two reasons. One is that you need to make a ton of connections, and there&#x27;s not (to my knowledge) an easy way to force that from the attacker&#x27;s perspective. Even if there were, you would incur quite a bit of overhead from all the TLS handshakes. The second and more important reason is that the HTTP session cookie just isn&#x27;t going to show up in those first 256 bytes.<p>The second attack targets double-byte biases in the RC4 key stream. Again, these biases are known and measurable across all keys. By collecting a large number of ciphertext samples, you can perform analysis to recover plaintext. This is a little more complex because there is interdependence between bytes, but still not so tough. (Search for &quot;hidden markov model&quot; and &quot;viterbi algorithm&quot;.)<p>The double-byte biases show up at regular intervals over any given key stream. This is important! It means the number of connections is irrelevant to plaintext recovery. What matters is just the amount of ciphertext you can collect.<p>This makes it a much better choice to attack HTTPS. We can collect all the ciphertext we need from one TLS session (or three or four or five, it doesn&#x27;t matter). And we can also exert much finer control over where the HTTP cookies show up. As an attacker running JavaScript in a user&#x27;s browser, you have this ability.<p>As the research notes, neither of the outlined attacks is practical <i>today</i>. But they&#x27;re both knocking on the door. What if higher bandwidth or browser changes allow an attacker to take samples more quickly? What if someone refines the algorithms outlined in the paper? To the latter question, there are additional multi-byte biases (Mantin, 2005) they don&#x27;t account for in their attack. It doesn&#x27;t seem far-fetched to suppose these attacks could be improved.<p>So, is RC4 a game-over vulnerability in the context of TLS? Of course not. But conscientious site operators should look to migrate away from it as soon as practicality allows.",1404320063

7978031,comment,7977188,7977188,31,0,iretired,,,"I feel obliged to comment, although not with my normal HN username.<p>I’m 41.  I retired two years ago at the age of 39.  I spent 18 years working in Silicon Valley at four different companies of various sizes.  At 29 I was promoted to a first-level manager.<p>Two of the companies I worked for were successful while I was there, although not spectacularly so.  Mostly I minimized my costs.  For the last five years of my career, my base salary was about $200K and I was making another $100K in equity (stock options and vesting of restricted stock).  Of the $300K, I paid 40% in taxes, lived on 10%, and saved 50%.  Clearly, I made good money but I didn’t get an Instagram-style money waterfall.<p>I retired with $3M.  I’ve made another $1M off a well-timed investment of $30K in bitcoin, so my net worth is $4M now.  By the “4% rule” I should be able to withdraw $160K a year.  But I can’t shed my frugal habits that led me to this place, even though I feel like I’m living “high on the hog” here.  I’m going through about $60K a year ($5K a month).<p>I think that some people I know think I hit the jackpot.  But it’s really not like that.  Mostly, I made a long slog of working unending sixty-hour weeks and also being effective while doing it.<p>I left and moved to Russia.  (I speak Russian fluently as a second language.)  I date a succession of girls in their twenties.  27 or 28 is about the cutoff for me.  And they’re attractive girls: they’re not the twentysomething warpigs you see lumbering through the cubicle hallways of Silicon Valley.   My girlfriend at the moment is 20, which is less than half my age.  But I date other girls on the side.<p>I met a European guy with almost the same exact story: by some combination of success and saving money he is in the same position, although to a slightly lesser degree.  He’s my best friend in life: I’ve never connected with another man so well since childhood.  We throw dinner parties in my huge flat, and invite cure girls and stand-up guys.  We get each other 100% and feed off each other’s energy.  Our reputation is spreading and it seems like every week we throw a better party and with hotter girls.  Today I ran into an acquaintance on the street that I hadn’t seen in a year, and he said he’d heard of our parties and would like to get invited.<p>We are on a first-name basis with the owners of the coolest clubs and bars in the city.  When I met my current girlfriend, I invited her out on Saturday night to the coolest bar in the city.  She said, “I don’t have a card.”  I said, “I don’t need a card, I know everyone there.”  We went there, and as usual, the bouncer smiled and shook my hand.  Sometimes I invite a bunch of people to these bars and they get “face controlled,” but then I just come out and ask the bouncer to let them in and he always does.  This is the closest to being a celebrity that I’m ever going to get.<p>I tinker around with software.  I’m fascinated by Haskell.  But I’ve lost my passion for it.  I worked too long and too hard in Silicon Valley.  Now I want to read books, drink wine, hang out with my friends, and consort with lots of girls.  I don’t have the drive I had as a twentysomething.<p>I get a lot of invitations on LinkedIn to come and interview here and there.  Even though I’ve been gone for awhile, it’s clear that Silicon Valley is booming.  But I can never go back.  After seeing this side of the wall, I can’t possibly go back to a cubicle.  And I don’t know how I would explain my life.  “I had this great 18-year career.  I’m a great technologist and a great manager.  But for the last X years I’ve been doing… um… well… just pure debauchery.”<p>Having been at companies in growth mode, I know that there are really few good candidates out there.  I literally interviewed THOUSANDS of candidates during my career.  I know how clueless my competition is.  If I want to go back, I can.  Surely, there are much better people than me.  I’d say I’m at the 80th percentile in Silicon Valley.  But as I write this I know I can never go back.<p>When I first left, I considered doing a SaaS and had an idea.  I formed an LLC before I left.  But I’ve done nothing and have lost interest.  I no longer have the love for programming that I once had, and I don’t really need any money.  I’m enjoying my life.  So I just want to continue to enjoy my life.<p>I am happy in a way that I have never been.  My biggest problem is shedding the mentality that brought me here.  I got here by busting my ass, taking names, saving as much as I could and investing.  It was a feat of disciple.  I chewed my 20-year-old girlfriend out for not keeping the wine glasses of my guests topped off during dinner at her end of the table.  She’s attracted to my status and confidence, but she doesn’t really understand my mentality, especially since it is essentially alien to her culture.<p>Ironically, I’ve taken a job two nights a week teaching English for $9 an hour.  But I enjoy it.  I connect with the students and the students love me.  I think the people at the school are confused, because they know that I have this crazy life of high-end clubs and a fashionable flat in the dead center of the city, and they don’t know how I support it on my income.<p>TL;DR: I busted my ass and made enough money to escape.  I’m enjoying my life.",1404319827

Electric power, that is, without a tank of gasoline or Diesel, for the energy for a car, is tough, super tough, for now and a long time, too tough to store.  It&#x27;s tough.  Storing electric energy is tough, too tough for a car and likely also for wind and solar to feed the grid.  Yes, there are ways to store the energy from wind and solar for the grid, but those ways are too expensive, by a factor of about 2, over other means of electric power generation that do not need storage, even if the power from wind and solar are just free, as in totally free, as in $0.00 per megawatt year.<p>So, let&#x27;s look at an example, say, Tesla.  I just went to their Web site and looked at charging time and saw<p>> During the work week I charge only at work during an 8hr shift from a 110 outlet. I only live 6 miles from work. I usually get ~30 miles of charge in 8 hours<p>So, right, 8 hours of charging for 30 miles of driving.  Lots of cars can go 30 miles on one gallon of gasoline that takes about, what, 20 seconds, to pump.  Diesel, maybe 45 miles.<p>The car, sure, it can still drive the wheels with electric motors, but, to make any sense, we store little or no electric energy in the car.  Instead, the energy for the car is stored in a 15 gallon tank of gasoline or Diesel.<p>We had electric cars going way back to the beginning of cars.  Why?  Because lead acid batteries and electric motors were already old things.  And, a battery much better than lead acid is still tough to get; indeed, we still use lead acid batteries in cars for, say, the starting motor.<p>The main problem with electric cars remains the batteries.  As a Ford executive said long ago, build me a good battery and I will build you a good electric car.  We are still waiting for a good battery, say, comparable with a 15 gallon tank of gasoline, in range, capital expense, operating expense, durability, and &#x27;recharging&#x27; time.<p>So far, a Tesla is a toy for rich people.  Sorry &#x27;bout that.<p>I could like an electric car; it would have a lot of advantages.  The problem is the battery.  And that&#x27;s been the problem for about 100 years.",1404319259

I&#x27;d agree she isn&#x27;t professional in all respects, but I think our definitions of &quot;professional&quot; differ. I say it because I had a minor beef with the way she handled the release of Hate Plus, it had OS X bugs she tried to refer up to Ren&#x27;Py rather than handling it herself and I felt like that wasn&#x27;t cool. I have this sneaky feeling that most people who say it, though, just don&#x27;t like what she <i>says</i>, and that&#x27;s not &quot;unprofessional&quot;, that&#x27;s she&#x27;s-right-and-I&#x27;m-wrong-and-<i>feels</i>.",1404319115

So far the only tangible outcome I&#x27;ve heard was a proposed $3 million to be used to hire ~100 government personnel to handle administrative tasks related to marijuana sales and regulation.  Given the fights that we see among politicians when it comes to spending other sources of revenue, I don&#x27;t see it being any easier to get this new revenue spent appropriately either.<p>2) Correlation vs Causation re: lower crime.  Who&#x27;s to say it&#x27;s not due to the beautiful sunny spring and summer that we have here in CO or the fact that it kept snowing in the mountains longer this year so people skied more?  The one thing I have observed is that legalizing marijuana didn&#x27;t convert a lot of non-users into users so at first blush it does not appear that legalizing marijuana has turned the state into a bunch of potheads (although I tire of hearing things like &quot;Denver is the Silicon Valley of weed&quot;).<p>3) Because there&#x27;s still no good research out on the effects (long, short, casual use) of marijuana (THC specifically) there is a lot of concern over the substantial increase in the amount of edibles, elixirs, and other marijuana infused products which can be purchased that are not well regulated or identified.  The same argument can be made for the vapor/e-cig industry.  Clearly identifying how much THC a product contains and what affect that will have on a person is much needed and should hopefully come about from the bills that Hickenlooper signed into law in May.<p>As others have said the reason you aren&#x27;t hearing any news from Seattle/DC is because they do not have everything in place to allow stores to open up.  Colorado moved quickly to both decriminalize as well as create regulations, tax structure, etc., which the other states have not done yet.  Many states are watching CO to see how this plays out and based upon the revenue figures that are being released as long as there isn&#x27;t a significant increase in directly correlated crime, I don&#x27;t think the politicians will be able to turn down the money in the long run.",1404318661

Startups are taking away some of their AWS customers with easier to use interfaces (some people just want a monthly cost for a VPS or cloud intranet).<p>Their retail site has been cutting corners and the search is inherently flawed because so many of their items are not sold by Amazon but 3rd parties who charge random amounts and there is very little quality control.

My latest iPad app made it to the #3 most popular position and has brought in enough money where I wouldn&#x27;t have to work for quite a while.

I&#x27;m not a lawyer myself, but it seems unlikely that the CEO&#x27;s actions here are something that the company&#x27;s lawyer would&#x27;ve advised. It sounds like she was asking for honestly much less than she should&#x27;ve been asking for, and unless there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing, I can&#x27;t believe it was in the company&#x27;s interests for him to refuse that offer.

7977891,comment,7977332,7977633,2,0,blocktuw,,,"I&#x27;ve been following all the legalization news closely since I live in Denver. The FUD from opponents of legalization are that it will negatively affect children since access will increase. The &#x27;hey mister&#x27; won&#x27;t be only for alcohol anymore but for cannabis too. Many edible products seem to be targeting children with products like gummy bears, hard candies, brownies, sodas, etc. This would increase the likelihood of accidental ingestion but also seems to be purposefully targeting children&#x27;s interests similar to cigarette cartoon advertising. The issues around advertising, specific products, and increased access for children most likely will be an ongoing problem that will require additional legislation to resolve.<p>Second there is a big fear of increased DUI. The framework for legalization required that there be a penalty for DUI, which has been pegged at 5 nanograms of THC per millimeter of blood. This has its own problem, primarily that somebody who is no longer under the influence can still test positive if they are a heavy user. Officers need better tools at their disposal to determine if a driver is actually a danger while driving. This seems no different than legal pills that people also drive while under the influence. This might be a technology problem since there is no way to tell if a person is under the influence of cannabis.<p>The third big fear is that organized criminal elements will be attracted to the legal market in an attempt to launder their black market sales. There was a big bust of legal grows and dispensaries earlier this year which was supposedly related to cartel sales out of Miami. This seems like the real reason the DEA should be involved in cannabis legalization. So they can determine who is playing by the rules and who is trying to subvert them.<p>Without much quantitative data, the qualitative affects of legalization seem to have a positive impact on people&#x27;s lives and the general communities around Denver in my personal opinion.",1404318292

PHP is good, because the baseline for programming language quality is quite high.  You can do <i>so much</i> stuff using PHP - you can build YouTube[1], Facebook, Wikipedia, WordPress and much more.  I don&#x27;t know what the total value of web applications written in PHP is in billions of dollars, but it&#x27;s a big number.  My point is that if that&#x27;s what we can do with <i>PHP</i>, just think what we could do with better tools!  In my definition, &quot;good&quot; means &quot;enables the creation of valuable things&quot;, and PHP does that.  I hope that it gets replaced by something better, for the same reason that I hope current medical treatments get replaced by better ones, but I can&#x27;t call it &quot;bad&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s weird, but programmers are sometimes the people with the least appreciation for how valuable their creations are.  We do things that non-programmers simply cannot do, creating massive value in the process.  Yet many programmers are afflicted by impostor syndrome and the sense that what they do is not really that valuable and that most of what they build is crap.  This negativity is misdirected, towards other programmers - &quot;I&#x27;m better than her because she uses PHP and I use Haskell&quot; - when it should be directed towards the things that cause <i>real</i> project failure.  A well-conceived and well-managed project that creates a PHP web application is <i>much</i> more valuable for everyone than a badly-managed project that produces a Haskell application that nobody uses.<p>[1] The first version, at least.

But, the difference between what I say and what the typical mouth breathers spout on, say, political forums, is that I can point to specific examples and evidence of why the status quo sucks.<p>What the people with a positive slant on all this seem to miss is that it’s not just any one area of computer science that is facing difficulties, it’s all of it.  For any technology or methodology, I immediately see flaws that range from merely annoying (semicolons in C, colons in Python) to downright devastating (shared mutable state between processes, the inability to statically analyze imperative code).  Very little software has been written that is provably bug-free, and it came at great cost.  Some of the control code that NASA has written comes to mind, or perhaps some of the early work in lisp, maybe a few other things like Excel that attempt to avoid programming altogether.  Most everything else succumbs to an inability to scale, because code complexity grows exponentially while performance grows linearly.  So code that works is generally small and modular.  Unfortunately, when we try to tie everything together under umbrella frameworks like UNIX, something is lost and we’ve never solved that in a mainstream way, at least not to my satisfaction.<p>The great successes today have come in spite of existing technology, not because of it.  I very much wish that the world would slow down for a moment, take a step back, and really assess the numerous ways that computing as we know it today has failed to deliver on the promises made by pioneers 50 years ago.  It’s like the recent post on HN of how concurrency is the new memory management.  While that’s true, it merely reveals the tip of the iceberg, not just in the fact that most languages fall down in the face of concurrency, but that even hardware has been unable to keep pace with the newest trends.  It doesn’t even scratch the surface of the wetware issue, that generations of programmers have been raised on orthodoxy that can’t take us to the next level.  I know that something is terribly wrong when I point out a problem and am met with such hostility, disguised as positivity.  To me, this can be as damaging as excessive criticism.  But it’s shielded behind the enormous profitability of the tech sector, where people would rather jump through hoops and make money than solve problems once and all for society and increase everyone’s wealth.",1404317689

MD5 is broken, but HMAC-MD5 is actually (to the best of our knowledge, and with a very low margin) secure. RC4 is not actually secure in any scenario.

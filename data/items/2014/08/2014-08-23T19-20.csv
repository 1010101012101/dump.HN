Kind feels like reading it is a drug trip, but you start to figure him out.<p>Understanding Media -- Seminal work, he lays out the medium is the message, media hot and cold, media as sensory extension, and other concepts as well as catalogues how he sees various media affect us.<p>The Mailer/McLuhan debate from CBC is really interesting as well, Mailer as existential/nihilist and McLuhan as nearly an analytic -- neither really talking philosophy. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtzxWR-j1xY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtzxWR-j1xY</a>",1408823933

They were in weird rural places, third world locales, etc. People would set up hacked relays and PBX systems, and there were instructions passed around every now and then about how you could call one of these, then call another number, and get routed through one of these ancient telephone networks.<p>I did it, and using a program called Blue Beep managed to hear the &quot;kerchunk&quot; and silence that followed a successful 2600hz injection into an open phone line:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueBEEP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueBEEP</a><p>From there I tried to do a few things, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work very well... just ended up getting a weird fast busy signal and getting disconnected.<p>I remember hanging on this article&#x27;s every word:<p><a href=""http://www.lospadres.info/thorg/lbb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lospadres.info/thorg/lbb.html</a><p>I also did the call myself around the world trick in 1993-1994, but using hacked PBXes.

Did it after seeing a story about this stuff, for old time&#x27;s sake. :)<p>I really miss the old hacker culture, which overlapped both senses of the term.<p>I feel like today&#x27;s hacker culture is really two major kinds of people. You&#x27;ve got people trying to hustle startups, which is similar in some ways but isn&#x27;t the same. Outside of that you&#x27;ve got this snarky troll-infested &quot;hacker&quot; culture full of mean-spirited people who... well... let me put it this way... are not as smart as they think they are. Their idea of a hack is to &quot;raid&quot; some social media site or deface a web site or whatever... it has nothing to do with exploration or invention. The derogatory term &quot;neckbeard&quot; is often used to invoke the popular stereotype. A person like Joybubbles would just get insulted and laughed at in this sphere, but when I was fourteen I was fascinated by characters like him. I looked up to their curiosity, and saw the way they used the early net to escape the confines of blindness and run around the world on wires as incredibly romantic and... well... fucking cool.",1408823210

Retargetting with Perfect Audience[0]. The idea is that not everyone will buy from you when they first visit your site, but by showing them some ads after they do you increase the chances that they come back and buy something. These people are especially useful to target because they have shown interest in your product.<p>2. A/B Testing with Optimizely[1] or a PHP equivalent such as [2]. If you want to update your site to increase conversions, A/B testing is probably the best way to do it. Basically you just want to propose new changes, then test them alongside your current site to see which ones perform better, then go with that one. This one is tricky though, because without enough traffic to your site a/b testing is a lot less reliable.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.perfectaudience.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perfectaudience.com/</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://www.optimizely.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.optimizely.com/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://phpabtest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phpabtest.com/</a> - I haven&#x27;t ever used this so you may want to do some research yourself.",1408822684

What should it do if it receives a negative length?  There is no great answer to that question.<p>It&#x27;s true that if you have a bug, you might accidentally pass a very large unsigned integer to memcpy().  But at least you can predict what memcpy() will do now: it will attempt to copy a very large number of bytes and probably crash.  Whereas if you pass a negative integer, it might reasonably do any of these things:<p><pre><code>   - nothing\n   - crash\n   - attempt to copy bytes *before* the supplied ptr\n   - assert()-fail and/or call abort()\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s worse, it creates a sense of anxiety for anyone implementing a function like memcpy(), because there is no right answer for what they should do with a negative length.  Callers of memcpy() might reasonably want any of the above.  But then you get your callers angry with you because &quot;obviously&quot; a negative length means you should do nothing, or &quot;obviously&quot; a negative length means you should assert()-fail (a programmer&#x27;s opinion about what is the &quot;obvious&quot; right behavior is often unduly influenced by their specific circumstances).",1408822167

If I&#x27;m good with a non-native implementation, I&#x27;d use Cordova, Phonegap, etc.<p>In my limited understanding, JS and ObjC have almost the same level of abstraction, so I do not quite understand what value this compiler brings to a real life project.<p>And as @phpnode says, you still have to learn a lot of ObjC anyways.",1408821743

If you don&#x27;t plan to inhabit the interior surface, there&#x27;s no need to spin it, and the problem goes away.<p>A sufficiently thin continuous sphere can be held up entirely by radiation pressure, but still presents engineering challenges with damping oscillations; a continuous structure is likely to tear itself apart just because it&#x27;s practically impossible to keep everything absolutely perfectly balanced on such a large scale. Which is why, per the article, the Dyson Swarm, a sphere made of lots of independently flying satellites, is much more plausible.<p>Incidentally, there are ways to eliminate the tensile load on a ringworld; you &quot;just&quot; have to stack enough suborbital mass outside of it (coupled by maglev rails or some such set up) so that the compression balances it out.",1408821704

I’ve been lurking for a while and it’s quickly become my favourite forum. I really enjoy the discussions here and I’ve learned a lot from them (I have 7 pages of notes taken from HN threads on everything from cold calling to resources for learning Python). I haven’t contributed because I don’t feel like I have the knowledge to add anything of value to the discussions. In any case If this thread is inappropriate please delete it and I apologize in advance for the inconvenience.<p>Now, for my question. I&#x27;m a University student in the UK, and with two friends I started a business called KitchPack selling packs of kitchenware and bedding to University students – delivering directly to their accommodation before they arrive. The idea is to save the hassle of having to lug everything from the other side of the country/world or the time and expense of buying it all upon arrival.<p>We launched last year at our University and sold out in 2 days. Since then, we’ve partnered with 32 Universities/Landlords across the UK. Each of our partners has their own affiliate website (e.g. www.kitchpack.co.uk/standrews) which they market to their students through contractually agreed upon channels (i.e. social media, welcome packs etc.) in exchange for a commission on each sale. In addition we also have a global website for people who aren’t with any of our partners to order.<p>As broke, non-technical students we’ve had to bootstrap the website on a £200 budget teaching ourselves HTML/CSS/PHP/JS to make it happen (we’re hooked on programming and have started learning Python). We’re proud of the result but we’re aware that it could be much better, and we’d really appreciate some brutal feedback from the knowledgeable folks on HN on what you’d change to make our website convert better.<p>Here’s a link to the global website:<p>www.kitchpack.co.uk<p>Thanks in advance for your time,<p>Jose",1408821549

And image gallery-like pages take long (I know because I save Imgur pages now than then :)). But in practice, this isn&#x27;t a problem.<p>There are a couple of heuristics to avoid wastefully uploading pages: the full page is uploaded only if the reader expresses &quot;sufficient interest&quot; in the page. Currently the heuristic is 90 seconds of continuous reading of a page, or scrolling to the bottom. If a page is read for a minimum of 10 continuous seconds then only the text of the page is uploaded.<p>Static assets like JS files benefit from deduping: they take time to upload the first time, but subsequently processing them is much faster.<p>Typically, people read multiple pages in a browsing session: I rapidly open many tabs and then read each one for multiple seconds. There&#x27;s a debug mode in Purple Rails in which a timer counts up when I switch to a tab. I find that typically spend 100+ (usually much more) seconds on a page that I read through to the end. This is usually enough time on a residential broadband connection (I have Sonic DSL) to finish uploading a page. I also use Purple Rails on a tethered 4G connection almost everyday: uploading is slower than DSL but it works.<p>Basically, by the time you finish reading a tab, the <i>previous</i> tab you read would have finished saving.<p>Like I said, nothing too fancy.",1408821374

It's not the architecture that is the problem, it is the architect. Or specifically the motivations provided to the architect based on the compensation they are given. Unwieldy and atrocious <i>looks</i> like it took longer to the untrained eye, even if it probably didn't, so they face less grilling about the claimed effort involved. Simple to use is, in my experience, rarely simple to build. But it is simple to understand, and there is a unreasonable cognitive bias that simple to understand means simple to conceive. If that point can become more a part of everyone's collective wisdom, I suspect we would cure at least part of the motivation for creating these unwieldy systems.",1231891009

The US Constitution was a legal framework for operating a problematic place & it did that job quite well. But I have no idea why it keeps getting referred to as if it's some sort of ultimate moral authority. The Bill of Rights is also a good sort of a document. But I don't see why it is better then any other high level statement of morality.<p>Some parts of it seem outdated. The US isn't an ungovernable collection of states that need Federation only for dealing with other countries anymore. There is also nothing wrong with Federation if it works. Even if you decide to work at county level, that's fine. But as with anything, you end up risking income discrepancies & the consequences of this (migration, resentment, estrangement, etc.)<p>But anyway, that's a completely administrative issue. How you should form a Government (states//Federation, Republic, Kingdom) is one thing.

As others here have said, the best way is to write programs. But you need to start somewhere and I would echo the suggestion of starting with python. I have heard Think Python is good and you can get it free here: <a href=""http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html</a> . You may feel you are parroting a lot at first without necessarily understanding what is going on, but gradually things will come into focus. When I first started, it was just by typing in programs in the BASIC language from the little tutorial manual that came with my computer. Each program would be followed by a little explanation of what each new line meant and after a while you start to be able to apply your knowledge to other things. Python is a ""just right"" language in that you can start simply but it has all the power you will probably need to get you as far as you want to go when you're ready. But if you find it's not working for you try something else. Some people pick up lisp right away - I still struggle with it (or at least people's explanations of it). Don't give up until you find something that works for you. I would also see what hacker groups are in your area or try and find some like-minded people to learn with - you may be able to find an intro course through a local college or community college if nothing else.",1231888250

Unanticipated volatility in the market creates the risk of a bank being insolvent.<p>To manage the risk of your car going out of control, you choose a safe speed.<p>To manage the risk of a bank becoming insolvent, it chooses an amount of capital to keep in reserve.<p>I seriously doubt you take exception with any aspect of the analogy so far...<p>A speed limit sign suggests a speed that is safe to drive.  However like any regulation it is only an imperfect estimate.  Yet people seem to drive at that speed under adverse weather conditions <i>completely irrationally</i>.<p>A reserve requirement suggests an amount of reserve capital that is safe for operation of a bank.  However like any regulation it is an imperfect estimate.  Few banks carry reserves in excess of those set by the requirement.<p>These are completely identical scenarios.  In each case, humans cluster around the regulation without exercising independent judgment.  Drivers slide off of the road all the time, and a bit of recent price volatility sent many banks into insolvency.<p>Your example about the UK is noteworthy but I would argue that due to the dominance of US banks (and US regulations) in financial markets, UK banks are inclined to mirror US policies in order to remain competitive with US banks.  Analogously, a Russian firm may adopt some US accounting practices if it wishes to attract investment from the US.<p>There are two factors:  The first is the way that the bar is set by the regulation in the first place.  T<p>he second is the grouping/incentive effect.  If your competitor has too few reserves then you are at a disadvantage for not copying that behavior unless the economy crashes (such that your competitor goes out of business and you don't).",1231887997

I only <i>wish</i> it were as simple as ""this platform does not reorder."" Having done low-level, heavily-multithreaded work on Windows for years: it'll behave like a strongly-ordered architecture 999 times out of a 1000 (or more). Then it'll bite you in the ass and so something unexpected. Basically, if you're doing your own synchronization primitives on x86, you have to pretty much rely on visual/theoretical verification because tests won't error out w/ enough consistency. I've run a test  (trying to get away w/ not using certain acquire/release semantics) for an entire week to have it error out only at the last second (x86_64). Other times, I've shipped code that's been tested and vetted inside out for months, only to have the weirdest bug reports 3 or 4 months down the line in the most sporadic cases.<p>0: <a href=""http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/barrier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/barrier.html</a>",1350662383

I relied heavily on family when I was picking up the pieces, and I was acutely aware of my good fortune of having that backstop.  Without it I would have literally been destitute.  So many people don't have a family safety net to fall back on, and those people are basically foreclosed from taking a big risk like starting a company without risking being homeless and bankrupt.<p>Consider wealthy ivy-leaguers: Bill Gates and Mark Z's backstop was to go back to Harvard and probably get some support from their upper middle class families.  Their plan B was way better than most people's plan A.  I'd argue that they had comparatively little risk when starting out.<p>I don't see it as a government bail-out, but as a way to enable a whole swath of the population to take risks that they cannot otherwise.  Something as simple as healthcare would make a huge difference for many people.",1350662269

It might take a little bit of effort to configure auto-complete mode to work very well with your favorite language, but I've found it well worth doing: it's far, far easier than learning some new editor and lets me keep using the rest of Emacs's great features in any language I happen to be using.<p>EDIT: Reading some other comments, there is Emacs-eclim that gives you Java IDE features inside Emacs. So forget what I said about Java: Emacs can now handle even Java well!<p>For dynamically typed languages, Emacs can essentially be as good as possible fairly easily. I've been using it for JavaScript and Racket lately, and it's been really great for both. For statically typed languages, there are often type-aware tools that make it as good as any IDE--for example, I've used TypeRex[1] for OCaml; there is also ENSIME[2] for Scala and similar tools for a bunch of other languages.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.typerex.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typerex.org/</a>

Now there are a bunch of changed variables there from decoding of content to display to television implementations to screen technology. So really its not like I could pin it on just the change in pixels.<p>I expect that the collection of things, media, player, and display, in a 4K world will seem better than a 1080p world, and of course big displays will eventually be very common (I really do think that at some point entire walls of video capable display might be the norm with a controller that can segment off parts to various displays)<p>[1] And I tried to watch an extended play VHS cassette the other day and found I just couldn't stand watching it.

Think about pre 2009 YCombinator.<p>Now consider post 2009 Ycombinator.<p>As the process became less risky: more guaranteed capital (the Ron Conway, Yuri Milner portfolio strategy), and more Acquahires.

It basicly implies that we should NEVER increase the pixel density of TV screens for home use since 50-60"" will probably remain as the mainstream market size. Yes there will be a difference. We have all these anti aliasing technologies because we want everything to look as smooth as possible. In the same logic, however fine images look in FHD, it can always be finer. Perception of moving images are not my field of study, but I could pose a very logical reason why higher resolutions are required. Consider a simple frame within a chronological video, at any given resolution. From one frame to another, there will be a refresh rate limit because you cant not change your image by half a pixel. At a higher resolution this refresh rate limit will be raised proportionally to the resolution increase.",1350659918

Reports are that 80"" is where the improvements really start to become real, though.   Not surprising:  at 80"", the pixels on a 4K screen are about the same size as the pixels on a 40"" 1080p screen.  That's assuming that you don't sit further back.   And you shouldn't.<p>There are reasons that IMAX is a much better experience than a typical theatre, and a reason why the large screen at the theatre is a better experience than the one you have at home.<p>- immersion, that feeling of being inside the movie yourself.<p>- peripheral vision.   Movies properly framed for IMAX are zoomed further out than a typical movie.   Your eyes are focused on the center of the screen, and the edges are only visible with your peripheral vision.<p>So yes, to really get the benefit of 4K you need to view Imax or similar content on it, sitting up close to a big screen.   There isn't much of it, but perhaps there will be more in the future.",1350659195

<a href=""http://wordmunger.com/?p=1348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordmunger.com/?p=1348</a><p>For those who didn't know, the eye can see over 10k pixels in an angle of a single degree (the fovea, right where we aim with our guns or bows, of course).<p>That means that in order for content and displays to provide you with the precision that real life offers, one should maybe consider a 40K TV instead.<p>In reality, the brain does a lot to interpolate and most humans aren't trained to make good use of their view anymore (how many of you are sharpshooters or combat pilots mhh?) and thus may not notice a difference at some times, especially when tired or in bad lighting conditions.<p>As I detailed in another comment somewhere, color accuracy is more important (IPS,OLED,..) than resolution because the brain cannot interpolate colors (quite logical indeed, how would you code that ? say that FFFFFF is more FFFA FFFA FFFC than FFFB FFFB FFFB ? good luck with writing anything else than random interpolation) and that means that focus on 4k TV should be secondary to focus on accurate sRGB TVs.<p>It doesn't mean, however that 4K or 40K is useless.",1350659152

When they released the remastered DVD it looks much better for having been shot in 8K first, even though the end product was only at DVD resolution. It's not just a matter of how many pixels you can see, the very fact that there are more pixels in the raw footage means the colors will be more vibrant and accurate is the final product. If nothing else the existence of 4K TVs will cause directors to shoot in 4K, which will make the end product better regardless of how many pixels you can actually see.<p>Also, if you haven't seen Baraka I'd highly recommend it. It's widely considered the best DVD of all time in terms of picture quality, and it's also the one movie that Roger Ebert says we should show aliens to explain the human race.",1350659098

The TV industry would like to tell me what is wrong with this screen, and for some things they have it right, and some things have it wrong.<p>What I actually want changed:<p>- Significantly deeper darks and better contrast. Playing a dark game or movie is frustrating compared to my Dell u2311 monitor. I really want an OLED display (I think) to fix this once and for all. A black screen should not light the room with backlight leakage. <i>THIS IS NUMBER 1</i>. Everything else is secondary.<p>- Less TV-included blur. This TV came out before the 120/240hz ones, so perhaps that fixes it. In a fast action movie, I want the blur to come from the 24fps film, not from my TV's poor drawing of the pixels on the screen.<p>- I'd like slightly bigger. I bought this to pimp out my 180sq/ft studio apartment. Now my living room alone is 2x that size will a properly setup 5.1 surround system and plenty of room. I could dig 60"" or so.<p>- More HDMI inputs. This screen has one. Yet I have about 6 HDMI devices that I'd like to use. Currently, I'm manually swapping this.<p>- Optical audio output. Kinda a weird one, but I've got a 5.1 receiver that doesn't handle HDMI. Otherwise, its fine. I'd like to run HDMI to the TV and have the TV output optical audio 5.1 for the receiver.<p>That's it. I don't need 3d. In two years, I still won't want 3d. It isn't a feature to me! I don't need built in Netflix. I don't need an internet connected TV. I don't need 4K. The main thing above that's actually not shipped AFAIK is OLED. That's it. Just finally ship OLED screens at a decent price!",1350658961

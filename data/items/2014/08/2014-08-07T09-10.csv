But it might be possible to make that coding simpler/easier so that people with domain knowledge could express it without having to code it, of course this is easier said than done.<p>Also taking a step back and seeing how things could work differently is a nice idea. One of the most recent examples is Bret Victor, just his demos gave a rise to a lot of new cool stuff. Or take LightTable, it has quite interesting ideas for interactive programming.<p>Regarding start-ups, take for example TransferWise, it solved a business problem, and it started as a two man band. ZeroTurnaround with it&#x27;s JRebel, solved a technical problem, but was conceived by one person.<p>So, yes, one person can make an impact, but it takes solving unsolved problems or noticing problems needing to be solved. Of course one person usually can&#x27;t be a business, which is somewhat different from making an impact.<p>As a start I would suggest watching Alan Kay and Bret Victor videos.",1407404599

Just look at the permissions of the topmost entries for basic apps like barcode readers, flashlights, compasses and so on. Now try the same on iOS and look what permissions you will be asked for, and which permissions you will need to actually use the app. Imo, iOS protects the average user much better than Android.",1407404496

On the other hand, I also have a Bay Trail Atom tablet, and it has fantastic performance for its power usage. The article talks about what a failure Atom has been. I think part of the blame is tech journalism promoting the fastest silicon. It appeals to some psychological desire, but it doesn&#x27;t make much practical sense.

8146832,comment,8143844,8146236,3,0,antimagic,,,"No, I don&#x27;t think the push towards greater coding literacy is about people becoming professional programmers.  It&#x27;s easy for programmers to forget something that is very special about what we do - we automate our work.  Every programmer spends at least some time writing scripts to analyse trace outputs, unit tests to automate testing, preparing macros for their editor of choice etc.  As this activity is very similar to our main activity, which is actually writing the code for a real product, we often just consider this to be part of the process.  But the thing is that just about every office worker has activities that could be automated.  Even if it&#x27;s just learning how to automate MS Office by using VB scripts, or learning how to shift files around your filesystem based on rules using Automator on a Mac, you can greatly improve the efficiency of workers.  Just think of the sort of analysis that knowledge workers could run if they just knew enough to write a webscraper!<p>This is the sort of literacy that the masses need.  They need to learn algorithmic thinking, and the basics about how to get to an environment on their computer where they can actually get started.  They need to know enough programming vocabulary so that they can Google for more information.",1407402814

8146829,comment,8143844,8145088,1,0,tragic,,,"A couple of reasons, I guess.<p>Firstly, since Google/Facebook/miscellaneous mega-startups, there have been people with enormous wealth and power who got there through the &#x27;engineering track&#x27;, and love developing software, even if they don&#x27;t do much of it any more. There are nurses who find their jobs intensely rewarding, but CEOs of big medical companies are not typically drawn from their ranks. So there are evangelists for code with powerful public platforms for their statements.<p>Secondly, the smarter of the SJWs realise that - in terms of diversity and so on - there&#x27;s a supply shortage further down the pipe. So a disproportionate number of do-gooder startups/tech non profits are focused on teaching more kids from different backgrounds the basics at an earlier age, since that is a sincere concern among the people who found such enterprises. (Throwing money at such things is a cheap, convenient PR move for the likes of Google, as well.)<p>Thirdly, as others have pointed out, teaching somebody to code requires a light capital investment up-front, relative to the value of the skill. There&#x27;s no way to become a doctor without years of med school; you can start throwing code around as soon as somebody gives you a refitted chromebook and tells you to type &quot;print &#x27;hello world&#x27;&quot;.<p>Fourthly, hype around the Valley and the tech industry today.",1407402721

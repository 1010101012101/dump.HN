This creates a strange situation. It will often be true that you could move faster if your weak programmers would just get out of the way. If you did this you would in fact make more progress in the short term. However, your tribe would lose some important benefits, namely the training of the weaker members, the spreading of tribal knowledge, and the ability to recover from the loss of the strong members. The strong must be gentle in this regard and consider the issue from all angles.""<p>This makes a lot of sense to me.",1227354882

372893,comment,372471,372471,0,0,kiplinger,,,"Interesting Read. Though I have read that some equatins regarding sub atomic particles were ""too difficult to solve"" before, I never had read a good explanation why.<p>It will be a sad day when the supercomputers we build to solve these equations gain intelligence and use their knowledge against us. Maybe they'll invent some cool null ray.",1227352228

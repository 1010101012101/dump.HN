Sometimes it can even infer the <i>program fragment that you were supposed to write</i> (given unification and uniqueness constraints), but it seems limited only to demo-level code and frankly at this point I&#x27;d be wondering if I got the <i>types</i> wrong and let the compiler infer bad code!

But if anyone could really put them together in a way that worked it&#x27;d be great. I&#x27;m not so sure such a language exists today, though.<p>There is Ur, which has both ML-style modules and Haskell-style type classes. It&#x27;s also pure and strict. And it has advanced type-level programming features and record types. There&#x27;s a lot to like.<p>There are a few problems with it, though. It&#x27;s mostly a one-man project. The compiler is immense, complex and almost entirely devoid of documentation (it&#x27;s pretty amazing actually, like 1 comment per 1000 lines or so), so contributing is hard. It&#x27;s very difficult, if not impossible, to use the language for anything but web development: there&#x27;s no way that I know to execute a program directly, rather than as a sub-program of the ur/web framework. The standard library is tiny and doesn&#x27;t even include `print`. But even with those warts it has enough good things about it that it&#x27;s worth checking out.",1422564781

Blockchain technology and Bitcoin are digital.<p>Years ago when analog signals had no longer been useful and became outdated, it became a law that all signal for television must be broadcast in digital. This was because analog required so much more energy and bandwidth then digital does.<p>What bitcoin offers is a replacement for all the energy and resources that are poured into money transmitters, banks, credit cards, and even recently wall street. The technology is expensive to run, but not more expensive than all of the above combined.<p>And to answer the question of transactions per second, the Bitcoin network is endless. The problem isnt how many transactions can you do, the problem is storage. The blockchain currently is 25 GBs of data that must be stored by many nodes. Though not everyone has to have a nod, if many do not and only big companies do, then it can become once again centralized. Even though 25 GBs is not that much, that is with only around 100-200,000 transactions a day in the BTC network. Visa does 2,000 a second alone.<p>So if the blockchain was to transact 2,000 a second, you are looking at PB hard drives in a year or so.

Heh.) Cloudflare seems to have done a great job of solving that problem.<p>But there are other reasons why DNSSEC isn&#x27;t deployed:<p>* We don&#x27;t need the DNS to be secure to solve real security problems any more than we need to authenticate IPv4 header options. TLS assumes the DNS is insecure and works anyways.  Meanwhile: even email spammers can spoof connections at a level lower than DNS, by using BGP4 to reroute the IP addresses DNS points to.<p>* DNSSEC exacerbates Internet trust issues. It&#x27;s a rigidly centralized system whose roots are dominated by world governments, a tree whose most important branches are controlled (literally) by NSA and GCHQ.<p>* It&#x27;s interesting, and a demonstration of skillful engineering, that Cloudflare can use DNSSEC ECDSA to reduce response sizes. But the roots of the tree still use RSA; the tree is still littered with insecure 1024 bit keys. Moreover, the ECC variant Cloudflare uses is itself outmoded, and experts suggest it would be optimistic to see it replaced within 10 years.<p>* Cloudflare might make it easier for organizations to flip the switch for the domains, but they can&#x27;t solve the software adoption problems of DNSSEC. DNSSEC breaks lookups, adding a bunch of new failure cases nobody is prepared to solve. For instance, every piece of software affected by the GHOST vulnerability is using an API that can&#x27;t communicate DNSSEC resolution success or failure.<p>* The most important application on the Internet is, obviously, HTTP via web browsers. And web browsers are not adopting DNSSEC. Browser teams at Google and Mozilla have both declared their efforts kaput. Apple removed their DNSSEC code from the most recent update of the OS. End-users are vulnerable to exactly the same kinds of attacks before and after DNSSEC deployment.<p>I see how adoption of DNSSEC helps Cloudflare: it&#x27;s yet another reason you&#x27;d outsource the operation of your Internet presence. That&#x27;s not a sinister motive, but it also shouldn&#x27;t be an animating motive behind a unnecessary and harmful forklift update of Internet infrastructure.<p>When I got started, in my first &quot;real&quot; job, you could set up the infrastructure for mailing lists on a FreeBSD 486 and be off to the races. Today, getting a mailing list running is such a nightmare of deliverability hacks and monitoring that most people (sensibly) give up and delegate the task to things like Mailchimp and Mailgun. More companies than not are hesitant to even host their own internal mail. Are we meant to be happy at the prospect of the same thing happening for DNS?",1422563826

8968655,comment,8965388,8967947,0,0,msandford,,,"My take is that separating the two is basically intractable and I wouldn&#x27;t even try to quantify it.<p>One person doesn&#x27;t have to work very hard to communicate all his/her ideas and priorities to him/her self so there&#x27;s zero communication overhead there.  A few executives are going to have to communicate a lot in order to all stay on the &quot;same page&quot; regarding the multitude of issues that a company might face trying to execute the overarching vision irrespective of it that&#x27;s from one or a couple of people.<p>The more time these people spend communicating with one another to ensure that they all understand one another, the less time they have to spend with their group managers, thus lowing the number of groups they can oversee.  As the number of groups an exec can oversee drops, you need more execs.<p>But as you get more execs, now you have a coordination problem at the executive level.  The problem is recursive.  The CEO can only oversee so many executives, so you get a CEO/COO/CFO triple team.  But those people have to spend time ensuring that they all understand one another.  Rinse and repeat.<p>Obviously there&#x27;s a &quot;management ratio&quot; that a person could glean out of all of this and just employ that to structure an organization indefinitely, at least in theory.  The problem is that all communication is lossy.  If you can communicate with 85% effectiveness (which is PHENOMENAL!) then that kind of limits how many layers you can use.<p>0.85 ^ 2 = 72%<p>0.85 ^ 3 = 64%<p>0.85 ^ 4 = 52%<p>0.85 ^ 5 = 44%<p>0.85 ^ 6 = 37%<p>This sort-of tracks with real world businesses too, it&#x27;s not often that you see an org chart which has 10 layers on it because the company would be totally dysfunctional and go bust very rapidly.<p>The &quot;Peter Principle&quot; applies to businesses too, the continue to grow and gobble up more market share until eventually they stop being as effective and growth slows or stops.<p>It applies to society as well as Joseph Tainter points out in &quot;The Collapse of Complex Societies&quot; each additional unit of complexity has a fixed cost and diminishing returns for the society (or the company, or whatever) until eventually you&#x27;re adding complexity which is a net negative.  Things then start to go downhill.<p>Obviously there are exceptions to this (think &quot;natural monopolies&quot; and the like) and there may be years or decades of lag between the start of net negative complexity growth and collapse.  Unless there&#x27;s &quot;refactoring&quot; of the system where complexity is removed somehow, everything will eventually trend towards collapse.  And achieving refactoring in real life is generally impossible since there tend to be entrenched interests in favor of some complexity since it directly benefits them.<p>A great example of this is the healthcare debate.  Doesn&#x27;t matter which side you&#x27;re on.  Complexity nearly always wins.",1422563577

At this point.. it would be very easy for somone with a couple thousands of dollars to buy half of the Gridcoin out there and perform the attack, its very expensive to buy half of the BTC mining hashrate.<p>BOINC has not released this system yet, it is still in the works and i look forward to seeing how it would work.

Васильев выбирал для своих произведений самые характерные, самые действенные темы. Он воспевал раздольные русские равнины, прославлял «великую труженицу» Волгу, создал прекрасные пейзажи Крыма. Основа работ Васильева – их жизнеутверждающее начало.\nВасильев - не только исключительно яркий талант, но выдающийся пример подвижника, целиком отдавшего себя искусству, не переставшего работать до последнего своего часа. Вопреки трагической краткости его жизни (он умер от чахотки в возрасте двадцати трех лет), наследие художника весьма обширно, а его вклад в развитие русского искусства необычайно весом. Проложив новые пути в русской пейзажной живописи, достигнув большой глубины в передаче человеческого чувства в общении с природой, он оказывал влияние даже на старших своих современников - И.И. Шишкина, И.Е. Репина. Выдающийся русский художник  И.И. Левитан считал Васильева одним из своих учителей.\nОставленное Васильевым наследие можно считать огромным, особенно, если учесть его раннюю смерть. Новизна мотивов и, часто смелое по приемам,  их\nрешение в картинах, рисунках и сепиях, дают достаточно ясное представление о стремительности развития творчества этого художника, в особенности, когда знаешь, что из семи лет его непрестанной работы три последних года прошли в борьбе с тяжелым недугом, рано оборвавшим его жизнь.",1422562675

You are competing against them regardless of what people say, simply because companies will talk to these agencies when looking at projects only requiring one or two people to do over a short period.  You compete against them not by lowering your rate, but by offering a solution not a warm body.  Overall, I see rates typically from $100-$185/hr in the South East, some try to get $225-250 but reality is I see those people losing deals and/or constantly discounting their rate to get work.  Your rate should constantly be going up as you get more experience and successful projects behind you that you can point to, but you&#x27;ll find the point which it is in balance with the market.  Also, discounting your rate is generally a bad idea, don&#x27;t do it if you can avoid it.  A couple of clients have told me before that they think a discounted rate means you know you are overpriced and are just looking for a sucker. Not sure I totally agree, but I don&#x27;t discount my rate because I never really have a fixed rate, I will vary it by the job, duration etc.<p>2. Avoid these sites, unless you are outside the US in a low cost nation where you can live on $1-2k USD/month.  Use friends, co-workers and previous employers as a first start and go out and talk to people and companies. We have found work on Craigslist a number of times where companies were looking for a &quot;coder&quot; to write their project.  I don&#x27;t get turned off by poorly written ads, or obviously non-technical people seeking help and will call them up and discuss their needs.  I have walked away with $40-70k deals this way when some friends looked at the same ad and said it was a waste of their time to call.  Fuck it, call them the worse you find out is the job isn&#x27;t worth your time but you can still use practice on your sales pitch and interviewing potential clients. I have a client right now that I found on Craigslist and called up, that contract ended up being roughly $60k over the next few months, not bad for less than an hours work searching craigslist and calling him up.  Of course it took a couple of weeks to get the contract in place etc, but well worth my time.<p>3. There are a ton of things you need to know, get yourself insured, always have a contract with clients, get paid by the hour, day or week.  Demand payments be timely and stop working when they aren&#x27;t. Small clients I make pay weekly or at worst NET 10, medium clients I go NET 10 and up to NET 30 the larger they get.  Accept you will get screwed over a few times with clients not paying or paying slow, just learn from it and try not to repeat those mistakes.  Set expectations clearly, and avoid clients you feel are going to have unrealistic expectations, no matter how desperate you are. Don&#x27;t take on more then you can do, it will just piss people off (rightfully), at the same time, don&#x27;t turn down work, just schedule it for the future when possible.  Don&#x27;t let small clients drag out the project or let scope creep in.  Every client will try, but small businesses seem to be the worst, they will call/email you constantly and always want more for free.  Don&#x27;t let people devalue your time by getting your time for free, you don&#x27;t have to be rude, but make them respect that your time is worth money.",1422562187

The more information a type system can express the less likely it is to guess correctly at what you want just based on your value-level representation of intent.<p>Which is really fascinating when you think about it. It basically expresses (what we all know) that <i>your code captures only a fragment of the intent of your efforts</i>. Good types can capture much more intent.<p>So to that end, people explore interactive development. In this scenario, you provide a (potentially partial) type corresponding to the programmatic intent you desire and the <i>compiler conducts proof search to find programs which satisfy that type</i>!<p>The types are actually <i>more informative</i> than the programs and it provides some evidence that we&#x27;d really rather be writing at higher-level typed languages and letting the implementations fall out naturally rather than writing the implementations and hoping that inference can build the proper types.<p>Or something like that.",1422562161

It feels like people think it means there&#x27;s no structure at all.",1422561606

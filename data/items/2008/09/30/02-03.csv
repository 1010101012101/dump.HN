Religion encourages you to stop looking for answers and to just believe what you're told.  Where did the Universe come from?  ""God made it.""  Where did God come from? ""He has always been.""<p>Those answers aren't good enough for me.",1222743526

It tends to happen when I concentrate on one ""thing"" in an abstract manner for too long.<p>It has been useful for visualizing overarching design - if I know what an unwritten application needs to do I might visualize how the ""parts"" should fit together (not in any magic sense, just faster than I would without being in that state). Sometimes it's good for solving logic problems, riddles, etc.<p>Sometimes it's not good for anything at all. Most of the time that it is really useful, it's by coincidence.<p>It's not a physically draining thing for me at all, just a bit disorienting.",1222743520

319212,comment,318595,318990,0,0,netcan,,,"I'm not necessarily representing my view. But <i>a</i> view:<p>Economics is far from a fundamental science. Very far. It is really more of a description of what happens via all sorts of analogies that usually hold true & help to explain the things that we see happening. Some parts of economics are stronger then others because they are based on manipulating tautologies of various sorts. But others are really more along the lines of: 'If we put a dog here, the sheep will go there'.<p>As with most non fundamental sciences, economics can break down in extreme circumstances. Neuton's Mechanics is not as fundamental as relativity. It breaks down in extreme cases. That only seems strange because physics is very fundamental. But with Zoology, Sociaology, Phsychology or other ""downstream"" sciences, this is expected. No one's surprised when techniques break down during psychoanalysis of a woman raised by wolves.<p>Psychology is explained by Biology, explained by chemistry, explained by physics. And each of those words is just really a number of links in this chain in themselves.\nEconomics is two or three links up that chain. So here's how we go back to the topic:<p>If a supermarket chain that supplied 85% of food in a region goes out of business, leaving it empty of competitors, what happens? The rules still apply. Consumers seek alternative. Small shops, mail order shopping, markets become very lucrative. Consumers spend more on food or get 'less' for a period. Eventually, a new equilibrium is found.<p>But what happens if the equivalent food producers go out of business? Wheat doesn't get sown. Coke doesn't get bottled. Sure it's a great opportunity for boutique vegie growers. But the same rules no longer apply. 20% of the food supply means there isn't enough for everyone to eat right. Maybe people sell off Apartments to buy houses with backyards (to grow food). Maybe they take time off work to plant. Maybe things are too volatile for boutique farmers to get investment to grow.<p>I'm not saying this is a close analogy. I'm certainly not saying the 'bailout' should've happened. If I were American, I'd be as suspicious as SwellJoe of a bill that's called ""tax breaks for Peace Corps & stuff"" which gives unreal sums to big companies while the salesman-like proponents chants 'This is too complicated for you to understand', 'You need to decide now' & 'Apocalypse is coming so pick mine.' But I am saying that relying on high level economic principles here is not like relying on gravity. Not at all. At best it's like relying on wolves  attacking a  calf over a bull. It makes sense. It usually happens. But who know what happens to traumatised wolves from a a circus during a thunderstorm.",1222743399

319209,comment,318248,318740,0,0,DaniFong,,,"At the first pass, it would mean that possibilities would add up correctly.<p>Here's one example: give every investment, stocks, bonds, cash, commodities, etc. a distribution of possible returns. Then, every holding company also has a distribution of possible returns, obtained by adding up and scaling the distributions of the stock respectively held. So long as the market changes at a rate substantially faster than the holdings change, this is a self-consistent model of stocks in that the total amount of expected stock value remains the same. One can then examine the distribution of possible returns of a given investment and assess one's own position of risk.<p>The problem with this is how limited it is. It does not, for example, account for hedge fund pricing well at all, since in hedge funds the holdings change nearly as fast as the market does. It doesn't account well for the wiles of any particular, fast trading investor. It does, however, lend itself to a fairly simple model for static futures, forwards, options, and swaps.<p>Why is this line of reasoning interesting? The credit systems we used to have couldn't handle the complexity of the derivatives that were being created. By one method or another, bad investments, especially mortgages, were being added up, and in the process the market found it difficult to track how risky the summed investments were. Credit rating agencies don't even make publicly known what their credit ratings represent! An investor is compelled to then blindly believe them, which, in this case, spectacularly failed.",1222743124
319207,comment,318595,318859,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Tax rates are negative, zero, or nominal for most people. There are perhaps 100 million people who pay a substantial amount of income taxes in the US (I am fudging around various numbers to make the math easier, here; see <a href=""http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/1410.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/1410.html</a> for information on how many people simply don't pay taxes). So that's an average of $7000 per serious taxpayer. $7000 is 5% of $140,000. Do you think a typical 40 year-old taxpayer has a $140,000 equity portfolio?",1222743067

The first year or so was much easier - you're hitting all the easy sales, the ones that are geographically close, and the technically-sophisticated early adopters. After a while you've plucked the low-hanging fruit and each sale becomes progressively more difficult and expensive. Meanwhile, the support costs for existing customers accumulate and competitors proliferate.<p>As a startup, it's easy to differentiate yourself from competitors by offering better-quality service. The difficulty lies in scaling up to a large number of customers.",1222742592

If that bill passed you would have saw the stock market go up today. Thus restoring temporary faith in the market and economic system.

The only time it becomes a problem is if I accidently click on an arrow, which I think has only happened once for me so far.<p>Adding undo wouldn't add clutter, just see how reddit does it.",1190249269

The grants will not come with any conditions except that the grantee use the funds to build their company on Facebook Platform.<p>What is the total investment in the fund?\nInitially, the fund will make available $10 million in capital. This may grow over time.<p>Who is eligible?\nAny individual or company, anywhere in the world can apply as long as they have not raised any formal venture funding.<p>What companies are involved?\nfbFund will be administered by Facebook and funded by Accel Partners and The Founders Fund.<p>Will there be any equity granted in exchange for the investment?\nNo, Accel Partners and The Founders Fund will have the right to fund these companies first, but beyond this, no equity or debt will be associated with any grant made.<p>Who is participating in fbFund?\nThe investment committee will be comprised of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and CEO, and Chamath Palihapitiya, Facebook vice president of product marketing and operations.

By decreasing the barrier to start a company, we hope to entice an even larger group of people to become entrepreneurs and build a compelling business on Facebook Platform. We hope this is also a funding model that other venture capitalists will follow.<p>How will you decide on investments?\nAnyone will be able to apply for an fbFund grant from the Facebook website. All proposals will be reviewed by the advisory council and then approved by the investment committee. The goal is to get decisions to potential grantees within the month that they apply.<p>How does an individual or company apply?\nInitially, you can mail your business plan to platform@facebook.com. In coming weeks, we will set up an online submission process. Submissions are being accepted immediately.<p>What will be the criteria for selection?\nWe want to see the most innovative and ambitious proposals for building a business on Facebook Platform.<p>How long will it take to hear back from the fund?\nThe goal is to get a response to the applicant within 30 days of receipt.",1190249188

User\nmanagement, permissions and a model for resources go a long way toward\nmaking a platform.<p>As Firefox, Silverlight & al. become more and more like desktops,\nvirtualization allows Linux to become more like a cross-platform application\nenvironment.

Finally, maybe have an up vote/down vote bank that can be exhausted for a given time period.  Since you have so much free time, anyway.",1190247001

57132,comment,56626,56863,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Yeah my thoughts. Although I don't know if it impossible - GWT does work of an AST - no reason why other languages couldn't drive it. Perhaps the contenders would be scala (static) and JavaFX markup stuff (which is also static, and designed for UI). <p>I know its unpopular, but for GUI stuff I prefer statically typed code. It is more verbose, but I find GUI stuff really hard to test (even with friendly tools) and having the compiler do some more work for me I find saves time on silly errors when manually trying stuff out. Yes I type more (or my IDE does really), and I am doing the work for the compiler to some sense, but I find it easier then any other way I have worked for many years doing this.<p>Its actually ironic (in the alanis sense), I would love a good static typed GUI language, but a dynamic one on the server ;) Maybe my brain is backwards, but I haven't been convinced so far by anyone who has shown me they actually <i>do</i> anything with what they talk about. <p>I do like JavaScript the language, where its going, when it is removed from the browsers. I wouldn't be unhappy using it more (just less so for the GUI - well I am keeping an eye on where jQuery is going it seems about right as a general tool for front ends for me, but not yet).

57129,comment,56957,57058,0,0,dood,,,"The problem with this is firstly that it creates a feedback loop, where the more commented something is, the higher it climbs, the more commented it is...<p>Secondly, it'd be hard to extract a quality measure from comments alone - there are a number of metrics (number of unique users commenting, rate of commenting, amount of voting...) but how do you get from that to a quality measure? How do you distinguish controversy from quality? Or comment threads full or jokes and snark?<p>Also, commenting on anything you disagree with or dislike would result in that link getting a boost, which can't be right.<p>All that said, I think comments could be used, but modestly, as part of a bigger algorithm.",1190246673

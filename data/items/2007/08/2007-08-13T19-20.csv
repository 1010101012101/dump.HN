I'd been upgrading FF consistently until I realized that every new version just got worse and worse. So now I'm done upgrading. I understand that the ""X"" mark to close tabs is now on every tab, rather than on the right side of the pane. So, there: I've missed that ridiculous change.<p>It's worse with other things. The Java IDE Eclipse starting at 2.0 made a simple change: The search box defaults to ""Case Sensitive"", and never <i>learns</i> that I wan't this unchecked. Believe it or not, this destroys my productivity. So, I've learned not to upgrade Eclipse anymore. I don't care if they add a million new features--they've effectively destroyed the software for me with one stupid change.<p>There is no shortage of people who regret the 2000 > XP > Vista upgrade/descent path.<p>I remember the first VCR my family had. <i>Put tape in. Press play. It works</i> Want to try improving on that? You can't. DVDs are a nightmare by comparison. There's a 15 step process between holding the disc in your hand and actually watching a movie.<p>Consumers are more savvy than you think, in some ways. They realize, at some level, that companies just release the same thing over and over, sometimes with a new talking paperclip, sometimes with a new talking dog, and it's otherwise the same. The transition costs aren't worth it.<p>Of course, I'm talking about upgrades rather than Brand X > Brand Y transitions. That might actually be worse, since <i>everything</i> changes.",1187034331

42043,comment,41884,41884,0,0,mikesabat,,,"You are already competing with Google, or better yet, the expectations they have created. Because of their immense ad revenue they can afford to buy companies and apps and then give them away for free.<p>Although your product may be different you're already competing for people's time and attention online. If you're building something to give away for free - then you are opening up the possibility of being Google-ized (as well as the positive of being bought by them)<p>Abstractly speaking, obviously.",1187033599
42042,comment,41716,41716,0,0,jmpeters,,,"Facebook is like AOL and MySpace. It will remain popular. It will make a lot of money. It will make its founders rich. It won't live up to its hype. Given its closed, proprietary nature, it won't be where true innovation happens on the web. <p>I don't blame the Facebook crew for the overhyping of their product. That blame rests with the investment community, tech journalists, and a reasonable-sized chunk of the blogosphere, who collectively are about as discerning as a clique of 15-year-old girls. They think that what's ""hot"" is whatever they think everyone else thinks is ""hot,"" which creates an echo-chamber effect surrounding every half-way successful web business that comes down the pike.",1187033362

They do provide an option to skip, however.<p>Maybe you missed it because you wrote the story with a sensationalist conclusion in mind. At least you got to say 'fuck', right?",1187033039

The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.<p>Academia.edu has over 1.3 million registered users, and over 3.7 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,000 academics join each day.<p>We need talented engineers to come and help us accelerate the world's research. We believe that there is a chance to make a big impact.<p>We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812</a>.

We're a 10 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=""http://academia.edu/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.<p>The kinds of things you would be working on include:<p> building new features (a conference feature, a discussion feature for papers)<p> enhancing existing features (News Feed, Profile page, paper upload tools)<p> building back-end infrastructure to scale the site<p>What we're looking for are:<p> 2+ years of web development experience<p> Experience with the full engineering stack<p> Passion for engineering<p>All the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them.

In the latter case, it often boils down to time and equipment. If you do things on your own time, using your own equipment, then you're probably OK, with various conditions. The most common condition (in my experience) is that what you're working on must not be something that could be construed as being related to the company's line of business, past, present, or future (which is intentionally broad).<p>Another thing they might have is a disclosure section, where you have the option of listing inventions or other IP that you want to claim as your own. This would be an attachment, like Appendix A. I'm not sure what the best approach is here.

</code></pre>
which is a lot more self explanatory than<p><pre><code>    new Melon(10, 10) 
</code></pre>
That being said, for a lot of common and well known fuctions (including map, filter,
reduce), Objective-C tends to be overly verbose. I think everybody is looking forward
to the new literals, that will allow you to replace<p><pre><code>    [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:foo, @""foo"",
                                               bar, @""bar"",
                                               nil];
</code></pre>
with the much more concise<p><pre><code>    @{@""foo"": foo, @""bar"": bar}
</code></pre>
Underscore.m tries to achieve something similar. I hope that people will be able
see past the - granted, inconventional - syntax to focus on the actual operations
done on the data structures.
For example:<p><pre><code>    // - (NSDictionary *)transformedDictionary;

    NSMutableDictionary *result = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
    [myDict enumerateKeysAndObjectsUsingBlock:^(id key, id obj) {
        [result setValue:[obj transformedObject]
                  forKey:key];
    }];
    return result;
</code></pre>
vs.<p><pre><code>    return _dict(myDict).map(^id (id key, id obj) {
            return [obj transformedObject];
        })
        .unwrap;</code></pre>",1338568374

One big difference between scripting and non-scripting languages is that, in scripting languages you can modify the structure of the program at runtime, while in compiled languages you are stuck once you compile it. C++ does have metaprogramming through the use of templates and those programs look immensely complicated, but it can't introduce new data types and logic at runtime. I kinda dislike C++ from beyond templates as the code looks super ugly.<p>The ability to modify the program at runtime (and elegantly) is a huge advantage over compiled ones and allows you to express new category of solutions. 
Programs that change itself is in my opinion pretty advanced.<p>So it seems, Python and Ruby allows the programmer to free the mind from the low-level housekeeping and focus 100% on logical thinking and give incredible expressiveness. I would buy that.

Given the exterior noise level of around 20 dBA (the plant is located in the wilderness), the thick concrete walls of the facility, and some additional noise and structural isolation he might very well beat Orfield's record with a much larger chamber (meaning it will be anechoic down to a lower frequency).

As the author points out, on the Metro side, the desktop is just another tile. Strange.<p>And on the desktop side, they've removed the start button, so the taskbar looks incomplete. To go to the start screen, you either need to move your mouse to the bottom left corner to reveal the start screen icon as a hover/tooltip sort of element, or the bottom right corner, which brings up the charms bar with the start button. In both cases, it's move/hover/click. In both cases, not self evident (like a button!?) and not super discoverable. This makes more sense on a touch device but it's not so great for mousers (e.g., the people who will run the desktop version in the early days, a.k.a nearly everyone).<p>I'm guessing (and hoping) that they have a new  alternative to the classic start button planned for a final reveal in RTM that will take you directly to the start screen.<p>It'll be interesting to see how this is solved over time.

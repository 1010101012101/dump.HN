2470427,comment,2466290,2468672,2,0,SeanLuke,,,"""Local Search"" is an unfortunate term -- it's optimization, though the term ""local search"" is historically common in the hill-climbing community.  But I don't think many people would place Genetic Algorithms (GA) in anything other than the ""global"" category nowadays.  Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, Evolution Strategies, Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, etc.: these things are global stochastic optimization techniques.<p>The terms ""search"" and ""optimization"" are often conflated, mostly because ""search"" was used by two different communities early on to mean two different things back in the 1970s.  You still see echoes of it in the optimization community, particularly in single-solution techniques like stochastic hillclimbing, or old terms like ""beam search"".<p>So here's how I define them.  I believe that ""search"" typically is applied to problems where you have something to search <i>for</i>.  A state or point in space which meets a certain criterion.  The most common examples of this are state-space search problems, where the path you took to get there matters, and constraint satisfaction search problems, where the path doesn't matter, only the result.  It's also applied in simpler fashions: tree search, binary search, etc.<p>Optimization, on the other hand, applies to problems where you are trying to find a point which is optimal with regard to some criterion.  Unlike search, where it's a find-it-or-not proposition, in optimization you do not necessarily expect to find the globally optimal criterion ever, and in fact you don't necessarily even know that one exists (it could just keep going up and up).  You're just trying to find the best thing you can given the time and resources you have.<p>Optimization algorithms are usually more general, and weaker, than search algorithms.  Thus you can typically cast a search problem into an optimization problem -- for example, use your heuristic as the optimization criterion -- but optimization algorithms were designed for a more general class of problems and thus are expected to be outperformed by a custom-designed search algorithm (this fact is a general rule of thumb for pretty much everything in optimization, particularly stochastic optimization -- it's a last-ditch approach).  Similarly you can use an optimization algorithm to find a decision tree solution: but I'd get smacked around by colleagues in the machine learning community for calling PSO a machine learning algorithm.<p>So interesting question: is Alpha-Beta Pruning a search algorithm or an optimization algorithm?<p>At any rate -- Russell and Norvig are entirely muddled about this.  They admit (p. 121) exactly what I state above, yet go on to lump the two together without any further explanation, and then make the strange case that local search is global if it is ""complete"" -- a very logician way of stating it, but not a term in the field so far as I know.",1303390698

2470399,comment,2469838,2470313,8,0,dspillett,,,"He wasn't suggesting that all Reddit's problems are due to Amazon services, he was using Reddit's down time today as a data point illustrating that the uptime guarantee claimed for the service has not been kept this year (in fact a whole year's ""permitted downtime"" as implied by the 99.95% SLA may be eaten on one day). Presumably Amazon will be handing out some refunds and other compensation (assuming the SLA isn't of the toothless ""it'll be up at least 99.95% of the time, unless it isn't"" variety).<p>Perhaps the Reddit admins decided that ""up to 0.05%"" downtime permitted by the SLA would be acceptable, compared to the extra expense of using more of Amazon's services (and any coding/testing time they may have needed to take advantage of the redundancy depending on how automatic the load balancing and/or failover are within Amazon's system) to improve their redundancy. By my understanding the promise isn't 99.95% <i>if you use more than one of our locations</i>, it is 99.95% at any one location, so the fact that Reddit don't make use of more than one location is irrelevant when talking about the one location they do use not meeting the expectations listed in the SLA.<p>I'm not saying Reddit's implementation decision is right (I don't have the metrics available to make such a judgement) but it would have been made based partly on that 99.95% figure and how much they trusted Amazon's method of coming to that figure as a reliability they could guarantee. If I had paid money for a service with a 99.95% SLA, unless the SLA had no teeth, I would be expecting some redress at this point (though there is probably no use nagging Amazon about that right now: let them concentrate on fixing the problem and worry about explanations/blame/compo later once things are running again).",1303390164

One thing we discovered from the international audience at HN is that our site didn't work with unicode, and folks abroad wanted to be able to adjust their timezone from the default US/Pacific.  We added those features and now we have a huge following in Japan.<p>I wrote a bit more about how we got our first 5,000 users here: <a href=""http://blog.idonethis.com/post/4779807862/how-we-got-our-first-5-000-users"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.idonethis.com/post/4779807862/how-we-got-our-fir...</a>",1303387351

2470294,comment,2468470,2468786,2,0,sophacles,,,"Running out of ports is a poor way to put it, but it can be read as ""Run the target machine out of fd (file descriptors)."" In unixy systems there is a system parameter limiting the maximum number of file descriptors that can be open at one time (actually 2, per-proces and system-wide limits). These limits need to be turned up for big servers.<p>The why is a pretty boring story: the number exists as a check against runaway processes or big jobs (e.g. busy servers) causing an I/O overload, so the numbers are set to a ""reasonable value"" by default. Of course the reasonable value is usually much lower than the system can handle, and at tuned for older common hardware.",1303387294

2470289,comment,2469838,2470262,2,0,olegp,,,"The problem with Amazon is that despite touting an open API, their infrastructure internals and practices are a trade secret, so the likes of Eucalyptus are having to play catchup. In other words, I cannot replicate their infrastructure in my own data center, even I had the money to pay them. I suspect this is the main reason that Heroku didn't move off Amazon, and not the fact that Amazon was providing them great value for money.<p>There is definitely value in platforms, but those platforms should be built on completely open standards with no vendor lock in or influence, as is the case with OpenStack for example: <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/10/rackspace_buys_openstack_partner/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/10/rackspace_buys_opens...</a><p>If you didn't watch my talk, I should point out that I'm working on Akshell (<a href=""http://www.akshell.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.akshell.com</a>), which is itself a platform provider, so I am in fact agreeing with you.",1303387253

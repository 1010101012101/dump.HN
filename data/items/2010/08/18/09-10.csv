Time is needed so JavaScript engines still enhance a bit, as well as browser's rendering engines. Everything else will be palliated by libraries providing a good game development environment for games in JavaScript.<p>For the moment flash has an enormous edge, but i don't see anything preventing canvas+JavaScript to become a very good platform for gaming in the next 3 or 4 years. Whether it will be used or not is another question.<p>On the other hand i don't see Native Client having a big success. I could very well be wrong about that, and it's really just a feeling, since with proper ecosystem and integration, it could become a lot better than flash for web game development.",1282125113

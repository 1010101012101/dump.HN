2091077,comment,2090773,2091012,0,0,geelen,,,"Well, a couple of things. If you look at a branching model such as that described by Vincent Driessen [1], you start to appreciate the amount of information encapsulated by branches and merges in the history. In a fast-moving project with several developers, glancing at the history becomes the easiest way for each developer to keep track of what the rest of the team has been working on.<p>Thus, anything that introduces noise to the history reduces the value of the information it contains. But 'git pull' is even worse than this - it actually creates 'misleading' history:<p>Each merge commit has (at least) two parents, the first of which is special in a subtle way - it's the commit you were _on_ when you merged the changes _in_. So, with a nice history, you can follow a branch back in time by following the first parent of each commit.<p>When you 'git pull', the merge commit has your local changes as the first parent, and the rest of the team's changes look like a separate chunk of work merged in.<p>Git-bisect is an extremely useful tool for searching the history for the commit that introduced a problem, but a history full of misleading merges dramatically reduces its usefulness.<p>Still, YMMV, the costs of keeping a good history may outweigh the benefits for you and your team. For me and mine, it's definitely worth it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a>",1294725162

I even\n    went so far as to write an entire compiler and environment (a \n    several man-year endeavor) to design two different runtime oriented\n    dialects called GOOL and GOAL used in 8 Naughty Dog Crash Bandicoot\n    and Jak & Daxter games. All 30-60 FPS action games -- 40 million copies\n    sold. All written in Lisp! (more or less)\n\n    Eventually, it was Ruby that got me off Lisp. It does most of what made \n    Lisp great, and the support factor is huge. There are clean standard \n    libraries for everything, the garbage collector is good (the one in ACL \n    is was so awful and dated -- I last used it in '07 -- you pretty\n    much had to turn it off.\n\n    I miss the S expressions and the macros. But you can do most macro like\n    things with a good block expression in Ruby, and you can even do \n    auto-generated macro like functions with strings. It just isn't \n    as elegant as Lisp.\n\n    The Ruby class system is a bit baroque, but it's actually \n    better in many ways than CLOS, which suffers from being too dated. \n    In Ruby you can do a lot of very cool things with extend and include. \n    It's just a slightly different way of thinking.\n\n    The implementation isn't the fastest, but it's good. The Lisp \n    implementations were all clunky and felt like 80s codebases. \n    Oh wait, they are.\n\n    Support. The rate of change in Ruby is 1000x that of Lisp. \n    Some new website has an API -- someone writes a Gem immediately.\n    In Lisp you don't even have a really standard networking library!\n\n</code></pre>\n(from <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1998321"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1998321</a>)",1294723087

Well, I think some of the more insulting/demeaning/negative-reinforcement isn't so great, but the overall focus on achievement and duty as superior to having fun... I do respect that. I'll explain why -<p>I used to think the opposite until I read Andre Agassi's autobiography, ""Open"" - Agassi was one of the top tennis players in the world, hit #1 multiple times, and generally achieved tremendously a lot. He's now married to Stefi Graff, the top women's tennis player of all time, and they have two kids and seem like a really healthy and happy family.<p>In his book, Agassi talks about hating tennis. He really does. His father, an immigrant to the USA from Iran, <i>drilled</i> tennis into him obsessively from a young age, constantly telling him he's going to be #1 in the world.<p>Agassi was miserable a lot of that time.<p>So, why do I think it's a good style of parenting?<p>Because people from the driven overachieving backgrounds don't realize that people with more normal lives go through their own sorts of miseries. If anything, I think Western culture leaves people directionless and in angst and miserable through their younger years more often than not.<p>The kid that just follows the minimum program, hangs out, drifts around, gets high a lot, and then wakes up at age 42 with no professional success, no real social circle, no accomplishments, no family, no skills, working at Starbucks...<p>...y'know, it's socially acceptable to criticize people for overachieving and striving at the expense of other things, but it's not really socially acceptable to criticize people for mediocrity. It's kind of taboo to put down that people who spend their youth chasing pleasure frequently break down into full-on existential crises and madness later in life.<p>The vast majority of people don't self-actualize and don't achieve real meaning in their lives. Most people ascribe this to their background and external things. So you sometimes see people people who grow up under intense parenting styles say, ""Well yes I tended to achieve more, but I was unhappy"" - maybe, but remember that the grass is always greener on the other side...<p>I'll say one very real downside of the intensive parenting style - it has a much higher variance/standard deviation of results. You're likely to make it very professionally successful, or completely break down under the pressure. That's the downside. But overall, would someone like Andre Agassi have been happier if he'd just farted along and been a middle manager at some warehousing/shipping company in Nevada? Yeah, he often hated tennis and hated his father, but in the end he inspired millions of people, got to experience triumphs most people will never feel, achieved a complete mastery and harmony between his mind and body in competition, built a family with an absolutely incredible woman, and lots of other good things.<p>There's downsides, sure. But the grass is always greener on the other side. I could point out my opinions as to the flaws of any given parenting style, but I find the duty/achievement end of the spectrum to seem closer to overall well-being than the reverse.",1294722756

It lets you write queries like this: db.users.find(M.age > 21). This produces standard Mongo query objects so works with any ODM, or none at all. With Minimongo you could do something like Posts.find( 10 < M.comments.votes < 100 ).",1294722610

Perhaps in the typewriter days this made sense, but nowadays a quick typo and backspace simply causes a minor slowdown.<p>Z-Type's use of typo-free typing as a simple bonus multiplier provides a penalty for typos without treating them as fatal problems.  I can type far more quickly with occasional corrected typos than I can if I slow down enough to make zero typos in the first place.  Thanks for handling that case!",1294722526

No, a user's search results would only be affected by what their friends upvote and downvote (or possibly their friends of friends as well).<p>This would make it in a user's interests to link to their friends and have their friends rate websites, as everyone uses web search. So people would want to promote the search engine to their friends.<p>To give people more of an incentive to proselytise the search engine, I'd add social features such as a twitter-like service (allowing public, friends-only, and named-recipients-only messages), chat (text, voice and video-voice), an extended-length messaging service (you could call it, I don't know, a ""blog"" or something) that also allows pictures, and RSS feeds of one's own and one's friends' public entries.<p>I'd also add a ""fan"" feature (intransitive, as opposed to friendship which is transitive). People could create lists rating websites, and others could fan those lists.<p>Maybe someone like DuckDuckGo might want to implement something like this?<p>(Incidentally, DDG market themselves as being privacy-friendly, which coupled with the recent subpoena of Wikileaks' Twitter data, suggests there may be an opportunity for a competitor to Twitter that is more privacy-minded).",1294722300

Poor AMD.<p>There is still need for actual hardware on which to run all those VMs. One cannot just dump a 1000 loaded VMs on a quad core Xeon server and expect them to work as if there are 1000 real dual core machine.

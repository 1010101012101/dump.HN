1004712,comment,1003609,1003609,0,0,kelnos,,,"The timing on this article is somewhat notable -- for me, anyway.  A few days ago I received an email regarding a user survey for Facebook.  I was curious (and motivated: I do use Facebook a lot, and wouldn't mind helping to improve it), so I clicked through.<p>The survey included some free-form text boxes with open-ended questions, and and one of my answers suggested that FB needs to do more to promote its brand as something people should trust, and take actions that make that trust deserved.  I noted that I still do not really trust FB, and that lack of trust curtails my use in ways that probably cause me to get less utility out of the service than I could otherwise.",1261223996

If I recall correctly (I'm not a professional designer by any means), many design books are against that. What caused you to decide to do that? Did you discover it focused the user's attention better?<p>Thank you for sharing this information with us! Data is always fascinating and your story is inspirational :-)",1261223960

1004708,comment,1004483,1004483,0,0,bithaze,,,"Heh. So let's make sure I understand this. Solving the CAPTCHA will give the victim the illusion of regaining control of their computer, yet it's the last step in creating a Facebook account? I'm actually a little impressed by this one.<p>I'm not entirely sure I understand this part though: ""The bad guys have made it difficult for Facebook to cut them off, since active members are actually creating the new accounts, says Correll."" What difference would the creating account's age have when making a new one? Sure, it has the benefit of originating from a relatively legitimate IP, but the age of the now compromised account seems arbitrary in this context.",1261223768
1004706,comment,1003609,1003735,0,0,kelnos,,,"Yeah, that annoyed me.  Pretty much any example in that vein provokes a ""think of the children""-inspired eye-roll from me.  What's the deal with that?

1004694,comment,1002723,1002897,0,0,kelnos,,,"Same here.  I overuse parenthetical statements like crazy.  Once, long ago, I was told that you should only use parenthetical clauses when the sentence will still make sense and give enough information if you were to just delete the clause entirely.  So, with that in mind, I'll often just try to delete the parenthetical and move on.  If I really care enough about what's between 'em, I'll try to rephrase, maybe by putting it in a new sentence.",1261222584

To reframe the discussion, this is about the ever present cycle of innovators that become incumbents and innovators that disrupt incumbents. If you haven&#x27;t heard of Clayton Christensen&#x27;s book, The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma, it&#x27;s a good read.<p>While some of the people mentioned in the article are young (Bicket and Miswas of Meraki are in their 20s/early 30s), other entrepreneurs in the news today are not: Acton and Koum of WhatsApp (recently bought by Facebook for $19B) are in their late 30s/early 40s.<p>Google&#x27;s founders, Larry and Sergey, are 40.<p>Twitter: Jack Dorsey is 38. Biz Stone is 40. Evan Williams? 42.<p>Steve Jobs&#x27; best work at Apple was when he was in his late 40s/early 50s. Arguably, the success of Apple today is due to Steve&#x27;s leadership, not due to the company being saved by some young person who breathed new life into the company as this quote from the NYT article suggests: &quot;The most innovative and effective companies are old-guard companies that have managed to reach out to the new guard, like Apple&quot;. (If you disagree with this, look at Apple between 1985-1997 and 2011-present, where plenty of young (and old) people worked at Apple)<p>To simplify the claim here: there are those who know how to adapt to the current situation and those that don&#x27;t (or can, but don&#x27;t care). Some of those who know how to adapt are &quot;old guard&quot; and some are &quot;new guard&quot; -- it&#x27;s not the age that is the determining factor.<p>As for other items in the article, like the lack of young people &quot;help[ing] cure cancer or fix healthcare.gov&quot;, there are plenty of old (older) people who don&#x27;t want to work on those problems too.<p>As for the claim that startups are the bastion of youth, that&#x27;s not true either. I see plenty of 40-something founders and startup employees. While young startup people can easily afford to do a startup because their financial commitments are low (e.g., no mortgage or family to support), the older folks tend to do a startup for a similar reason: they&#x27;ve earned and saved a chunk of money where they&#x27;re no longer worried about money and they can take on more risk.",1394661542

That&#x27;s trivial for an object like that, but it can quickly become complex: one mutex is not enough because it blocks the whole object, so you start having multiple mutexes. But then you don&#x27;t remember which mutex blocks what so you must have some good documentation about that, but the documentation is not as well maintained as the rest so it starts rotting. And then your file spreads among so many lines you can&#x27;t quite grasp all the ways parallelism can kill you.<p>In the given example, the mindset is different: _all_ methods called from the outside are non-modifying, they only stack the change to be made. The actual data manipulation is done in a very tight loop that does a very simple thing, and nothing outside of this loop ever deals with memory. As a developer, you can fit all the code that can be &quot;dangerous&quot; in a mere 7 lines of code, instead of having it spread among the file.<p>I concure it&#x27;s a different mindset, quite different at that, but it&#x27;s a pretty good one (ang go makes it very pleasant)",1394659744

Not just that it didn&#x27;t work economically, but that it led to undesirable, authoritarian societies. Problem is, Marx didn&#x27;t advocate what was later called Marxism. In fact, he famously said &quot;je ne suis pas un marxiste&quot; - &quot;I am not a Marxist!&quot;.<p>That article is misleading and tendentious in many ways. I was going to write a post debunking it, but I honestly didn&#x27;t manage to get to the end. I found it&#x27;s just not worth getting worked up (&quot;Someone&#x27;s wrong on the Internet!&quot;). Just some short ideas:<p>- The author seems hung up on one aspect of Marx&#x27;s thinking, the concept of alienation. While it is an important concept for Marx, I think if you just single out one aspect, you risk making a similar mistake to the Marxists (who emphasized the expropriation of workers&#x27; surplus value, and the need to get control over that surplus through class war).<p>- People who most vocally criticize Marx usually haven&#x27;t read him. I&#x27;m no fan of the Soviet Union, but Marx doesn&#x27;t advocate a state like that. His main opus, the Kapital, is a theory of Captialism, not of Communism. Most economists and many other academics don&#x27;t use Marx nowadays, but not because he is <i>wrong</i> per se, but rather because his work-value theory does not have much quantitative predictive power. You can&#x27;t use it to calculate much, but that wasn&#x27;t his goal anyway. Rather, (as I&#x27;d describe it in modern terms) he shows how from simple axioms you automatically get all the injustice and crisis-proneness he criticizes in capitalism (a la: Assume there&#x27;s a society where most people work, get paid wages, and buy the products of their labor on a open market.... BAM people who own the means of production get richer, etc.). I personally was really surprised how relevant his writings still are today.",1394659275

It actually reminds me quite a lot of the actor model - as each event loop is essentially an actor which receives and sends messages through channels. Background follows:<p>I&#x27;m the author of a Haskell library[1] for interfacing with HyperDex[2], a distributed database produced by some folks at Cornell.<p>The client-side library for HyperDex uses an event loop, and is &quot;thread-safe&quot; to call into as long as you synchronize access to the pointer. This is an awkward area to work with in Haskell-land, as the code I write has to deal with the intersection of the three uglies:<p>* Foreign function interfaces (and marshalling)<p>* Mutable resource management (allocating and freeing C-structs)<p>* Concurrency (synchronizing access to an object)<p>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of implementations. To speed up testing, I wrote a &quot;fake HyperDex&quot; client and test harness in which I can insert chaotic behaviors to test resilience.[3] While the code isn&#x27;t as clean as I like right now, it lends itself to the smallest, most compact implementations of what I want. Each HyperDex connection pointer is paired with an event loop which receives requests for calls into HyperDex and processes them. When a response is demanded, the loop begins a busy-wait (will soon be replaced by an epoll/select on an fd) on results from the database. Each asynchronous request is an event loop too - a free floating closure sitting in memory that sends off a message and waits for responses.<p>GHC&#x27;s garbage collector will determine when waiting on an MVar or Chan is deadlocked, and keeping everything in a ResourceT monad ensures that the whole system gracefully closes when portions fall out of scope and are unreachable.<p>The approach has a certain elegance to it. I am curious to hear what other people&#x27;s thoughts are on such implementations though, because there are naturally performance implications.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/aaronfriel/hyhac"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aaronfriel/hyhac</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://hyperdex.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperdex.org</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://lpaste.net/101084"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lpaste.net/101084</a> - a hodgepodge of code I wrote to test implementations - ill-documented, this is just for personal exploration and testing",1394658969

Regardless of the problem must be taken seriously , writes Enterprises CEO Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist .<p>Simplified debate . The discussion of gender equality in business should not just be about board seats . Our analysis shows that companies with women CEOs have lower profit margin than those with male CEOs . It can have several causes. Regardless of the problem must be taken seriously , writes Enterprises CEO Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist .<p>The debate about gender equality in business easily degenerate into a debate for or against affirmative action in exchange boards . It&#x27;s a simple question with opposites and it&#x27;s easy to take a stand for or against . But we want to achieve true equality when it comes to economic power in society must deepen the debate and tackle the much harder questions than that.<p>Ahead of International Women&#x27;s Day on 8 March, the entrepreneurs made \u200B\u200Ban analysis of the percentage of female CEOs in the business and how profitability looks in enterprises run by women and men. Our intention has been to give strength to the argument that more women leaders lead to increased profitability and that companies themselves thus should have a strong economic incentive to tackle the issue .<p>But the result was the opposite. Our analysis of the profitability of more than 125,000 companies divided into female and male CEOs gave an unambiguous result . Companies with female CEO is 12-17 percent lower profit margins than companies with male CEO . Concretely this means that companies led by women have on average 7.0 percent profit margin while the company headed by men , on average, 8.4 percent. The profit margin is a good comparative measure since it measures the profit a company makes before interest expenses in relation to sales. Thus does not affect leverage and firm size analysis, which is based on the latest available financial statements (in most cases 2012 or 2013). We also tried the obvious explanation that it could be due to its age, solidity, what industry it operates in , the number of employees or where in Sweden it seems . The result stands up and is stronger than if one does not account for these variables.<p>For those of us who want an egalitarian enterprise , it is a serious discovery. Differences in profitability not only affects the owner&#x27;s personal finance by return ( most businesses are owned and managed by the same person). At the economic downturn, companies with lower margins more vulnerable , which means that more companies are led by women were threatened with closure or bankruptcy.<p>The profit margin also affect the potential for expansion. In seeking new capital from outside investors or from the bank &#x27;s earning capacity one of several important factors that investors are looking at. Generally lower margins in women&#x27;s business means that more capital will be channeled to companies headed by men .<p>To present such a clear result is of course not without controversy . There are certainly those who take it as an excuse not to address the issue of gender equality. But it is not : we have only investigated the CEOs, not management teams or boards . There is solid research showing that companies with a true diversity, not only with men and women, but also in terms of different levels of experience , age, origin , geography , and other products are more profitable than homogeneous companies.<p>On the other hand, will surely discovery to be criticized by those who consider that the publication impedes equality. To them I would say that I , as a feminist and a member of the government delegation for equality in the workplace , is convinced that achieving gender equality and must, to be credible and win in the long run , based on solid facts and not filtered through political glasses.<p>The discovery puts his finger on a fundamental question : Why is it that female CEOs on average have lower profit margins ? In answer to that question are probably many important discoveries to make about how we work with gender equality, not only in business , but in society at large.<p>I do not sit on the answers but want to highlight some possible explanations , all of which require further analysis and debate.<p>One obvious possibility is that women are inferior to men on charging for the same product or service. My experience is , for example, that many women starting and leading welfare business comes from operational activities where care is more important than financial considerations. Many men in the industry will, however from the outside with a firm financial perspective from day one.<p>A less obvious possibility is that it actually has to do with how men and women are treated in business. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve experienced , where I sometimes considered &quot; young woman &quot; or mother , despite a long career in politics and business , and with two children approaching adolescence. The same is likely to occur in business transactions . With men on both sides of the negotiating table , so bondar man and lands in a &quot;good business deal .&quot; With a woman as a counterparty becomes different expectations and the search for consensus smaller.<p>A third possibility is that the profit margin is lower because the female CEOs , for example, invest more in their staff. We know nothing about from our investigation , and if it is then it could of course be a real business decision. But if the result is a lower long-term earning capacity can also be any such benevolence be problematic.<p>Whatever the explanation , the problem must be taken seriously. It&#x27;s not a bold guess that a lower profit margin in the long term will have major repercussions on the desire to start and run businesses . It is unfortunate for equality itself. But the real tragedy is the many good business ideas , innovations and new jobs that will be lost .<p>I have long felt an aversion to the simplifications made \u200B\u200Bin the debate on equality in the business world , which is often reduced to be about changing a total of 270 board seats in Swedish listed companies. By raising the issue of profit margins , I want to help deepen the discussion. Not least , I want gender equality to act also on the more than 70,000 women who are CEOs, and in many cases the owners of companies that are not publicly traded . Do we want to achieve real equality in the business world , so we have to make the leap from listed companies&#x27; boards to discuss how women&#x27;s businesses to become as profitable as that of men . Then we really start to reach the core issue of how we equalize economic power .<p>Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist , CEO of Sweden&#x27;s largest entrepreneurial organization Entrepreneurs",1394658841

7388410,comment,7377250,7377967,1,0,gruseom,,,"This is really an argument against higher-level languages in general. A complex program written in a lower-level language will certainly be more explicit, and because of that many individual lines will be easier to read. &quot;INC EAX&quot; is as readable as it gets, by that standard. But what you correctly call the gestalt of the system is precisely what <i>won&#x27;t</i> be easier to see, because you have so much more code to work through. The idea that a system becomes easier to understand when its codebase is much larger is absurd. One major reason for making a system smaller is that its design becomes more accessible, and so in turn does the meaning of its parts.<p>In my experience, the kind of language hacking that goes on in Lisp systems is not as you describe it. Rather, it&#x27;s akin to what any programmer does when extracting duplicate code into a function. A better word for this than &quot;DSL&quot; is &quot;factoring&quot;; Lisp&#x27;s strength is that it offers a simple and powerful way of factoring that is harder in other languages.<p>I can&#x27;t comment on Smalltalk, except to say that the way you&#x27;ve lumped it in with Lisp makes your argument weaker.

RSVP is definitely faster (because eye movements take time) and particularly good for people with learning disabilities like dyslexia (because the tool isolate words), but there are trade-offs.<p>For one, saccades (the normal eye movements you make while reading) give your mind time to process the information. You need that. Secondly, RSVP tends to lead to repetition blindness, so you can miss repeated words, which changes your understanding. Also, people tend to zone out after a while of staring at one point. All of these aspects underpin overall comprehension and show where RSVP falls short.  Where RSVP shines is for short bursts of text (as the article states) and also for learning to read words in groups rather than individually, which is really really useful.<p>But back to my original point, speed reading isn’t just RSVP. It’s a collection of techniques that together help you read more effectively. Honestly, it probably shouldn’t be called “speed reading” at all - it’s what naturally strong readers already do. You solve for speed, comprehension and retention.<p>You start with the mechanics (learning to read words in groups, strengthening eye muscles, improving concentration etc) so that you aren’t getting hung up on bad habits, and then assess how well you understand and remember content.  In fact, when you learn to read in this way, you don’t even need the tools like RSVP and moving highlighters. Yes, they are useful training wheels, but you’ll already read that way anyway. You also won’t be tied to one service or medium.<p>Believe me, I find the hyped-up, late-night infomercial, eat-cake-get-thin approach really off-putting too, in fact it’s one of the reasons I made Acceleread in the first place, but don’t throw the baby out with the bath water.",1394658330

If one is interested in building distributed systems, there is simply more opportunity to do so at Google, Facebook, or other places in the software/Internet industry than in other industries (that&#x27;s not to say those opportunities don&#x27;t exist elsewhere, of course).<p>I do agree that it&#x27;s B.S. to say that legal challenges prevent investment in cancer research (unless people mean &quot;coconut oil cures cancer&quot; type of research, in which case they well should). I would probably say that if anything current patent law makes cancer research more profitable that it would be without it (however, I don&#x27;t have enough of legal background to speak definitively on this).",1394658008

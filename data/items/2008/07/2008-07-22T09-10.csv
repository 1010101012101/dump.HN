If anything the wild success of allofmp3 shows that people will pay if the price is right. The price point is wrong, not the model. High volume + lower price = Increased total revenue. This is the point we make when we meet with the labels.<p>""But what happens to movies? Do they morph into games?""<p>No they don't. Which is more popular the new Batman film or the new Batman game? Thereâ€™s plenty of room for both.",1216719617

(For example it took quite a while to figure out how to do a disk check on a disk volume.)<p>I wouldn't buy an iPod as soon as I realized you can not edit anything on the iPod itself.<p>It seems to me apple increases usability by removing functionality.

253117,comment,252655,253102,0,0,corentin,,,"By hard, we don't mean ""difficult to understand and master""; one can learn electronics on his own in the same way he can learn programming. The tools and skills required are on par with software (well, the tools are usually better); it's just that hardware requires much more capital and time to build, and you have to deal with a lot of logistics and business issues.<p>A small team with no capital can build a ready-to-ship software product. A small team with no capital can build a working hardware prototype, but the step from prototype to actual, ready-to-sell product requires lots of resources.",1216718996

I recently (4 months ago) was involved with a touch screen project and the available screens were garbage compared to the iphone. if techcrunch has a source for awesome touch panels that is amazing but I'm skeptical. the rest of the hardware is tricky but at least doable. the software stack will take at least four times longer than estimated, perhaps moreso now that every armchair programmer on the internet has been invited to participate.",1216717916

1256293,comment,1255858,1255907,0,0,wvenable,,,"> an experience Apple users have had with the couple decades of various levels of cross-platform development that Microsoft has done.<p>I'm not sure that proves your point here.  Microsoft has had a Mac development team since the very first Macintosh.  They write native software that is not a port of the Windows versions.  In the past, IE for the Mac actually had more features (and was more standards compliant) than the Windows version.  All this proves is that, yes, native apps can be crap.  Which is exactly why this rule is entirely pointless.  It's the not the development tool that matters, it's the developer.<p>> single handedly make me appreciate the fact that Apple is dictating that people write dedicated, high quality applications, directly for the iPhoneOS, rather than trying to do some crufty translation to that platform.<p>They're also eliminating any other tool or language which can also be written directly for the iPhone OS.  Something like MonoTouch uses the iPhone API directly, it just happens to allow developers to use C# instead of Objective-C.  No translation necessary.<p>Even Adobe Flash apps being recompiled for the iPhone isn't a big deal.  A high quality Flash game like Bejeweled, for example, is going work great on the iPhone if Adobe did their job right.  That is an opportunity for you to have apps you wouldn't otherwise have and it's not wasting programmer resources rewriting it to achieve the same result for nothing.<p>Rule 3.3.1 does not mandate high quality applications.  If you want that, make Apple use their approval process for that instead of their own selfish interests.  This rule does nothing to give you want you want.",1270957829

1256289,comment,1256232,1256232,0,0,orangecat,,,"I've found the Android API itself to be about on par with Cocoa Touch; some things are easier and some things are harder, but it seems to balance out. A major advantage for Android is that it uses Java instead of Objective C, giving you real memory management, no header files, and generally better built-in libraries. Also you don't have to muck with certificates nearly as much; apps can deploy to your phone immediately, and you just pay Google $25 (one time, as opposed to $99/year for Apple) and use a self-signed certificate to put it on the Android Market. And your app shows up on the market a few minutes after you upload it, and won't get pulled unless it's malicious.<p>For fun, Android easily wins IMO. For profit it's less clear; there are certainly more iPhone users, but it may be easier for a quality Android app to stand out. My paid Android app is earning around $10/day (before Google's cut), which from what I hear is on par with typical iPhone apps.",1270957655

1256285,comment,1256232,1256232,0,0,Magneus,,,"The experiences are comparable.<p>First, I'll address your concerns about code signing:<p>Android doesn't require you to go through quite the same certificate/provisioning profile insanity, but you will have to sign your applications before distributing them in the Android Market.<p>See here: <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.ht...</a><p>To develop on a device, it's brain-dead simple.

There's a quick automated process where you submit your development key in return for a maps API key.<p>See here: <a href=""http://code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html</a><p>Regarding development itself:<p>In terms of learning the development APIs and how everything fits together, I contend that Android is going to be tougher to learn at first, because you'll have to figure out fundamentals like Activity lifecycle, Intents, etc.<p>However, after you've gotten past the initial hurdles, I find that Android development (at least for the most part) feels more predictable and logically-designed than iPhone development.<p>In my experience, Android also has some better libraries out of the box. For example, doing basic REST calls, JSON, and SQLite are all in the standard library. On iPhone, you're best off using 3rd party libraries for each of those.<p>But there's always two sides to the coin. I find that iPhone is less structured, which can be good, depending on your tastes. I also feel that iPhone gives you a better-looking, better-feeling application with less effort (prettier default buttons, colors, animations, and there's always Interface Builder if you need it). If you're a game dev, also, iPhone tends to run faster and can utilize C libraries more readily than Android, whose ability to run C code relies on NDK/JNI, which can be a PITA.<p>To wrap things up, don't expect an entirely new process when you switch over to Android. If you didn't have the patience to stick it out on iPhone, don't think that Android will be the magic bullet that makes things easy. However, you'll be able to develop applications using the tools you like (not wedded to XCode), under the OS you like (Win/Linux/OS X), and best of all: no approval process to publish your applications. I've found that it takes minutes, as opposed to the App Store's days/weeks, for Android applications to arrive in the market.<p>I hope that helped.<p>P.S. I recommend The Busy Coder's Guide to Android. There's plenty of examples to get you started.",1270957430

We have similar levels of ""Arrrgh, this is so broken"" conversations--but about entirely different things. The android emulator is way slower, but running on a real device is quick and easy. Android has way better support for libraries--you cut and paste far less code. The APIs are saner, in general. Error handling is simpler, and you don't have to allocate as much by hand. Also, the store is a dream. We went from zero to installed via the market in ten minutes.<p>On the other hand, Android is Java--and all the horror that entails. There are also fewer people developing for android. The source is open, though--you can git clone the official apps and refer to them, which is invaluable.

The far fewer walkable neighborhoods make me sad and the summers are probably trying for non-native Texans, but considering the things most people optimize for when choosing a city, it isn't surprising that so many people are moving here.",1270955527

Even if they spend millions of dollars changing the generators in an arms race, it'll cost Apple orders of magnitude less to dissect their updates and write a program to flag the apps.<p>Don't forget that Apple has full access to the Flash IDE - they can generate as many Flash iPhone apps as they want, and test out their signature analysis programs until they fit - where as Adobe has absolutely no knowledge of what Apple is doing to detect their generator.<p>Apple has every advantage here. Adobe could put their best guys on it and Apple could defeat them with a single (smart) intern.<p>As for the long tail of code generators, which I wasn't talking about, I just don't think Apple will bother. They know they can't win there, but they don't need to. As soon as one of them gains any sort of popularity (like Unity), they'll cut them down, but until then, a few apps breaking the rules means nothing to them in the big picture.",1270955329
1256239,comment,1255858,1256046,0,0,davi,,,"I think there is also another dynamic at play: Apple makes high-end, high-margin 'lifestyle' computing devices. Every time Steve Jobs gets up and announces a new whiz-bang hardware or software capability in one of these devices, that whiz-bang capability needs to be deployed as widely and quickly as possible into the consumer ecosystem. This rapid deployment lets Apple keep ahead of the Joneses and continue to own the high-end space. If there is a lag while least-common-denominator, cross-platform tools incorporate the new whiz-bang features, Apple loses its temporal edge and gives time to competitors to catch up. The last decade has built up the ""Apple == newest"" identity in consumers' minds, and they don't want to lose that, it is one of the keys to their hold on the high end (another being incredible design and polish, at scale).<p>If everyone is writing in Cocoa on XCode, Apple's latest & greatest will be deployed that much more quickly.<p>I think this interpretation is consistent with Jobs' terse emails here, particularly  the line, ""intermediate layers between the platform and the developer ultimately produces sub-standard apps and <i>hinders the progress of the platform</i>"" (emphasis mine).",1270955280

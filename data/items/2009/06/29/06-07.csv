678618,comment,678300,678472,0,0,smanek,,,"The problem is that you can resell hard copy books. I usually spend ~$250/semester on used text books at the beginning of each semester (I'll buy them online), and get about $100 from selling them back (usually to the campus book store, although sometimes online if I feel I'm being ripped off too badly).<p>Net, I'm only paying $150/semester for books whose retail price is closer to $500. I don't think that publishers will be willing to price electronic books at 70% off retail like they would need to (since there is no resale of electronic books).<p>Ideally, they should 'rent' me the book for a semester for a huge discount (~80% off retail, say), and I have the option of 'upgrading' my rental to a purchase at the end of the semester (with no penalty over having just bought it outright upfront) if I decide I want to keep it.<p>That's basically what happens now on the secondary market. I get to 'rent' a book for a semester for the cost of the bid/offer spread, with the option to not  the rental and just pay the original price.",1246257696

678603,comment,678223,678223,0,0,thesethings,,,"Many teens twitter. (and I'm sure many teens don't.)<p>In general i think age is become a less and less meaningful way of identifying somebody (Other sub-cultures describe people a bit better), so I feel a bit funny having this conversation either way.<p>One of the main concepts of the article was pretty right on, that if you're talking about private stuff like what boy you have a crush on, Twitter's not a good place to do it (for adults either), but ""Teens Don't Twitter"" is a really bad title for that. It should be called ""Teens don't send private messages in places where others can see it.""<p>I mean, how does his thesis reconcile with how teens undeniably use Facebook/Myspace? The teen in question is so busy texting that she can't use Twitter? (But can use other sites just fine?)<p>Part of me just wants to give up on even responding to the weakness of the premise.<p>But I want to get this out there: Teens use Twitter.  I've learned this from YouTube, where I'm in a lot of mixed (age) communities centered around topics that have nothing to do with age, and people of all ages talk about their Twitter handles all the time.<p>In fact, it's through YouTube that I've discovered that Twitter is very diverse not just with age, but with ethnicity, disability and all sorts of things.  YouTube is one of the most diverse social sites I've ever been a part of, and I see lots of YouTube <-> Twitter mingling and integration done by users.<p>So yeah, teens are on Twitter, as well as lots of folks that are not your standard members of cubicle nation.",1246256580

678597,comment,678418,678418,0,0,sil3ntmac,,,"About a year ago I worked in support at a large webhosting company. 99% of the blacklisted email issues we <i>ever</i> had came from Yahoo. Some of the cases were legitimate (or is it illegitemate?) spam being sent out from our servers, but we would always find and eliminate these accounts. Unfortunately, Yahoo would blacklist the entire server IP, so none of the other users on the shared server could send email to yahoo either. This caused obvious problems, and we would spend days contacting support at yahoo to explain and get us un-blacklisted.<p>I also remember this happening with emailing addresses on the entire AT&T ISP. That effected about 40 shared servers (around 16000 hosting accounts, each with unlimited email). So yeah. Bad news.",1246256329

678594,comment,678245,678245,0,0,Tangurena,,,"Step 1: file for unemployment immediately.<p>Step 2: very carefully husband your money. If you have student loans, call them and ask for a deferrment until you start a job again. Likewise, ask your lenders for a deferrment as well.<p>Step 3: if you have friends or family that you can move in with, consider doing so.<p>Step 4: don't be fat. There is a lot of subtle discrimination against obesity, and not-so-subtle discrimination against being old (where old tends to be 35ish).<p>In 2001, I got laid off like a lot of developers. At that time, I had about 6 months of money in the bank, and I felt that I could ride out the downturn in the economy. I was too proud to file for unemployment at the beginning, and as the money dwindled, I found out that the contract agency that I was hired through had claimed I was employed for 3 months after I got laid off (they did that sort of thing to reduce unemployment insurance premiums). It took months to get that straightened out with the unemployment agency and by the time I got my first unemployment check, I also managed to get hired - 9 months after getting laid off. I ended up losing my car that summer to the repo man, and I couldn't get my mortgage/hoa payments caught up either, so I ended up losing my condo about 5 months after starting a job that was a 40% paycut.<p>The next time I ended up unemployed for an extended period (2003-4), I ended up using my lifetime benefits for unemployment in FL (if you make what most devs make, you'll hit that cap in about 6 months of unemployment). I moved in with friends, who had a hard time understanding just how bad the economy was, and that strained a friendship that has never recovered.<p>Back then, I sent out dozens of resumes every day to anything on Monster (or the local news papers) that looked like a job I could do.<p>In an absolute worst case scenario, talk to an Army recruiter. If they were taking 43 year olds in 2003, I would have enlisted. The army is taking folks that old NOW (marines, navy and air force won't take anyone 30+ without prior experience), but back when we were ""winning"" the cap was much lower.",1246255934

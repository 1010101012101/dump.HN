4827863,comment,4827319,4827590,5,0,clarkm,,,"I think it is important to note that the fast-food jobs with comparable pay are low level <i>managerial positions</i>, not entry level ones. You can start working for minimum wage at a fast-food job without any previous experience and/or skills. These jobs require very little training, and allow employees to add value almost immediately (and well before promotion to the $15-$20 an hour positions).<p>Contrast this to the skilled manufacturing jobs which require up front experience. Though many blue collar fields offer entry-level positions with on the job training, apprenticeships, and opportunity for advancement, this doesn't appear to be common practice in manufacturing. Why not? I think the main reason is that it is very hard for a low skill worker to add value to a manufacturing company. There aren't any comparable entry-level positions that allow the employee to learn while still being productive.<p>Because of this, hiring an unskilled employee for the purpose of training them is a huge risk, since it requires a significant investment. And since this industry is already very unstable with razor-thin margins, it's not something many employers seem willing to do, which is unfortunate.<p>So maybe the solution is coming up with better training programs, so that manufacturers can hire new employees without taking on such large risks?",1353840904

Let's not make a cult of failure for its own sake. The amazing part of this story is not the colossal fuck-up, but the fact that he succeeded once, make a massive mistake that tore down all his work, didn't get in his own way and give up, and then went on to succeed again. Had he not succeeded again, that initial mistake would have defined his entire life. That failure would have been the thing that he believed he was, not the success that he later became.<p>I had a mentor of mine suggest to me me over an early morning breakfast, ""Austin, at some point you may ask yourself if it's possible to stop 'failing in exchange for knowledge,' and actually succeed while simultaneously enjoying your work and learning twice as much as when you fail.""<p>That was a defining moment in my life and those words have rippled to where I sit now two years later. Until that moment, I thought that the only path to knowledge was called ""failure."" I simply think that's a lie we tell ourselves now. We learn more from success than we ever do from failure, and we shouldn't be in denial about that.<p>I'm still on the journey, but with a lot of progress behind me. I tell the story of my mentor not to point to position myself as the ""model for success,"" but merely to share my own journey learning the difference in my own psychology between failing and succeeding. One is life-affirming, and I choose that one.<p>Coming full-circle, I don't intend to take away from the Pando article. It's an incredible story of resilience, and the marine deserves credit and respect. It's just not a story of failure.",1353840727

salaries up in competition.<p>Unless the skills are not actually high skilled, but <i>obscure skills</i>.  I predict that ""high skilled manufacturing"" is a morass of proprietary solutions to 
highly specific process needs - that is, the metal fabrication plant alluded to at 10USD per hour has highly specific machinery doing a fixed task, and that the skill is mostly one of repairing the proprietary code.<p>From a software perspective, that mostly means the machinery is ""legacy"" - and impossible to refactor.  So it can never be improved upon, only replaced.<p>I am not a 3d-printer fanboi - the advantages of additative manufacturing are hugely over hyped (at the moment), and likely to remain elusive for, lets say, a generation, before it becomes obvious to all we throw away factories and their jobs and build millions of thing-o-matics.<p>However in that generation there will be huge opportunity for semi-general manufacturing - robots with sufficient flexibility in parts and software that they can be re-purposed easily as part of a (virtual) conveyor belt.<p>This sounds truly skilled work - flexibly adapting as processes and customers change.<p>if providing semi-general manufacturing machines is uneconomic compared to proprietary simpler but ""obscure skill"" machines, then we cannot expect a productivity 
premium for actual highly skilled workers and should expect
10USD phour jobs to limp along till Shanghai takes their lunch.<p>If however semi-general machines can be made to adapt to 
different manufacturing requirements, then our whole manufacturing base may be in want of replacing.<p>Again something emerging economies will have an advantage in.<p>So, overall, the West should view itself as Great Britain was at the end of the 19th Century - a pioneer whose advantages had run out, and without wholesale massive investment will simply enter a managed decline.<p>Disruption opportunities - Development of semi-general robotic manufacturing solutions that can quickly be re-purposed.

Deep learning is not going anywhere.  Its a false premise for algorythms that have trained neural nets better over a significant amount of time in fields that people care about.  It is not a solution, it is not new technology.  Molecular structures are pure math and computers do that pretty easily last time I checked.",1353838435

I know I've been surprised in the past when getting folk to work fewer hours results in more getting done (see this previous comment for the story <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4781103"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4781103</a> ).<p>I can and have pulled all nighters. I probably still can. It's just that I've learned that doing so, or spending more than about 30-35 hours a week coding, makes me slower - not faster - overall. Even, and I can't emphasise this point enough, if I feel <i>completely fine</i> doing those extra hours.  People are really bad at introspecting on their own productivity.<p>Figure out some metrics for productivity. Try cutting the time spent in front of the keyboard for a few weeks. Measure.

Indeed, I've made some spectacular money from pulling their nuts out of the fire. But the main reason that they had to do something dramatic was the accumulated weight of all their poor decisions. It's as if their technical debt was held by a loan shark, showing up  smacking them around just for fun.<p>It isn't the best product that always wins. But shipping a shitty product also doesn't guarantee winning either. All else equal, wasteful organizations lose out over time.

Retargetability is a function of compilers, not languages. Most compilers are retargetable. A good sign is if a compiler generates code for more than 2, unrelated processors. Retargetability is just an engineering design. Most C, C++ compilers (in fact, most non-toy compilers maintained by more than a half a dozen people) <i>are</i> retargetable.<p>Think of retargetability is related to portability, but not same. A compiler can be non-portable but retargetable. Many compilers for small embedded processors target a huge number of processors, while themselves running on only x86 and Windows. That is called cross-compilation :-)",1353837975

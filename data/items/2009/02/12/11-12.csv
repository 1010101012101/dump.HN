First, they can run around 100-150km (60 - 100miles) and after this they must recharge for a day or so. I.e. they are pretty useless on longer trips.<p>In Denmark, Dong Energy (which is Denmark's biggest energy company) has signed an agreement with Better Place to build electric ""gas stations"" where one can drive in and get a fresh battery. I think Israel also has an agreement. And with such gas stations, electric cars could be a very fine choice since they are cheaper (pr. km) and a lot more environment friendly.<p>And Teslas are pretty hot, so it would probably be a very good investment by the US gov.<p>Sources:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DONG_Energy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DONG_Energy</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Better_Place"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Better_Place</a>",1234439892

I've seen so many would be ""CEOs"" getting distanced from the code far too early, they just want to run a business and make a bunch of cash.  All the great companies have coders at their heart for the longest time, listen to their users, build a dedicated community and most importantly create a _great_ product.",1234439778

I do agree, though, that the really good people will generally still be able to find work, although not necessarily as quickly as they once would have.",1234439480

There isn't that much of the stuff pulled out of the ground every year, and most of it goes to small battery applications - not cars like the Tesla. Toyota's electric cars have purposefully stayed away from lithium because they knew that there was not enough lithium for Toyota sized production.<p>Unfortunately lithium is not traded on any futures market that I know of, and I know of no publicly traded stock on any exchange that solely represents lithium mining interests.<p>Does anyone know how I can buy bulk ($25k+) lithium? I'd prefer not to buy it from a science supply store. I'm getting a quote from <a href=""http://www.baotou-rareearth.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baotou-rareearth.com/</a> right now, but ideally there would be an ETF that tracks the price for me.",1234439402

When I see that ""open source monster"" character I can be sure that the article will be superficial, boring and useless. Why put all software with a chain less license in a pile like its all the same - with a single author, company, business plan?<p>OK, so now a bit about the office suites:<p>Some people need an alternative to MS Office, so they come together with some other people who also need a alternative to MSOffice and pay a third group of people to make in (obviously sharing and thus lowering cost of developing the software). MS Office is a collection of clones of previous software, but that hasn't stopped it, right? Has it slowed down the adoption? Yet it seems to stop OO.o - it isn't ""innovating"" whatever that means. Maybe innovation means making a new shiny interface with colorful buttons to push? Yeah, the millions of people who just want to make a simple document with some bullet points and a page number on bottom will greatly appreciate the innovation. Although in my anecdotal experience ""consumers"" are more impressed by the ability to easily make a PDF..<p><i>Just because you opened up some code doesn’t mean anyone CARES. The consumer is all about flash, dazzle and speed. The newer the better… no matter what the price is. The iPhone/iPod are great examples of this. </i><p>Because everyone wants to play the Apple game, right? Maybe some people want to do their dirty job quickly and cheaply, especially during a recession and all, but given how confident the author and the shiny magazines are I'm really afraid to say it - please don't laugh at me.<p><i>Songbird is the exact same as iTunes th main difference is leveraging a plug-in platform.</i><p>Another gem - the author cannot ""leverage"" a modern innovation called spell-checking, but knows that Songbird is a iTunes clone with plug-in platform which means it will not ""succeed""[1], unlike Firefox which ""innovates"" (of course Firefox is far more than a clone of a clone, but with a great extensions eco-system). I don't even use iTunes and I don't know what are the chances but I can see an obvious self-contradiction.<p>[1] What is ""succeeding"" anyway? Getting the most lip-service? Obviously that is the kind of world-domination we are talking about, since Firefox doesn't have the biggest market share and Google Chrome have even less, but they are succeeding.<p>I don't like Facebook and MySpace with all the conformism, small talk and general herd behavior displayed there and I'm starting to dislike blogs and even some aspects of forums (points, post-count, ranks).<p>I spend too much time in the Internet.. gotta do something useful, bye.",1234437857

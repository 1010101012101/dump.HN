I think we used Agents and Corporations, Inc., who were the cheapest at the time.<p>IIRC, to incorporate in Delaware, you pay ~$100 for a filing fee. Since you don't live in Delaware, you're also required to have a Registered Agent in the state, which also costs money and is built into the fee structure for whichever company incorporates you. If you just pick the cheapest turnkey incorporation service off Google, you're probably not going to beat the cost trying to DIY.<p>To answer some questions you didn't ask:<p>Are you sure you want a C corp? C corps can be liable for corporate taxes. If you're a 2-person shop, C corp status probably isn't what you want; you don't care about having a board of directors, and you want pass-through taxation. What you want instead is an LLC, which requires less paperwork but still provides you with limited liability, a tax ID, and an entity that can invoice and be invoiced.<p>Are you sure you want Delaware? You probably do, if only to save time and energy thinking about it. There's a NV vs. DE debate with alleged tax advantages for NV, but if you're concerned about startup costs, DE is probably the cheapest and most hassle-free. For instance, we looked in to incorporating in NY or IL (our home states), but both required us to run an ad in the paper announcing ourselves!",1219532366
284868,story,,,3,4,sil3ntmac,"Has anyone else coded up some hot forums?",,"I looked for a lightweight, easily stylable solution for a while, but I couldn't find any. I'm halfway through a PHP hack (you can register, login, and post threads and replies, just need a profile viewer/editor and a bunch of testing and it should be finished). I don't care much for a PM system when there's an email address/aim/msn/other contact info in the user's profile. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was, but does anyone know an easier method?",1219531858
284867,comment,283919,284524,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Epson, at least, uses a formulation that leads to most generic inks causing irreparable clogs.  I dunno how they do it, but I've seen it happen in two Epson printers--worked fine for a few months, switch off to a non-Epson ink (of different brands in each case) and within a week the printer doesn't work.  No printing, <i>at all</i>, just makes noise and moves its little bastard head around doing nothing.  When researching the topic, I found that design professionals (who print a lot, and use the big non-cartridge ink systems) recommend never using Epson inks to start with, and always using the generic brand you plan to use for the life of the printer...which apparently makes this problem go away.<p>Of course, after five dead inkjet printers (HP, Epson, Lexmark, HP, Epson) I finally got pissed off enough to refuse to buy another one.  Ever.  I bought a networked Konica Minolta color laser for about $800 six years ago, or so, and it's served me well ever since, and cost less than another five inkjet printers and their outlandish ink prices.  I've only had to replace one toner cartridge (black) in that time, and I expect to get another few years out of the printer.  It also has Postscript support, so I don't have to think about drivers (which is irrelevant to some folks, but I never want to spend an afternoon fighting with printers again...and a networked Postscript printer is the only way to guarantee that I don't have to).<p>When my dad started talking about buying a new inkjet after his third HP started banding badly (and new cartridges, and cleaning, didn't fix it) I bought him a $200 laser printer.  Best $200 ever.  I buy him a new toner cartridge every year for Christmas...it's held up great for three or four years now.",1219531506

One even met Bill Gates when he was 19 or 20. Said he was a whiny brat and no one liked him. That probably meant <i>he</i> didn't like them.<p>Anyways, in '96, I met a guy who had several brand-new never un-boxed Altair kits sitting in his garage. I offered him a few hundred dollars for a couple and he didn't budge. Wanted to save them.<p>I also found one in the Goodwill electronics section but didn't know what it was at the time.

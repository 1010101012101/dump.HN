These are two algorithms that aren&#x27;t as thoroughly analyzed.<p>One of the problems is that AES and Twofish were introduced 14 years ago at this point. AES has been hammered on by everyone since then, whereas interest in Twofish waned after it didn&#x27;t win. We&#x27;ve seen a little bit about Twofish since, but an order of magnitude more on AES. The scary thing is if modern advances could be used to attack Twofish, but because Twofish hasn&#x27;t gotten enough attention we don&#x27;t know yet.<p>Skein is probably at least as strong as SHA-2, but again, we&#x27;ve hammered on SHA-2 much longer than Skein.",1380754771

Hardcoded dependencies between JS modules leads to front-end spaghetti -- to me it&#x27;s only a marginal improvement over inline script/style tags.  It forces frontend devs to know too much trivia about how the backend/devops code actually makes the sausage.<p>A JS module or HTML widget should be able to declare what it needs without hardcoding how that dependency gets fulfilled.  (eg. if it&#x27;s loading on a local dev box, do this, in production, do that, running server-side in a Node.JS setting or in a test suite, do this other thing.)<p>So the system I built allows devs to declare the resources needed by a feature, then the asset management system converts those requirements into LABjs script loader code that gets output -- more of a makefile sort of approach.  That means devs can write more general, reusable, testable JS modules (and corresponding HTML templates) that can load through a script loader for better performance, but aren&#x27;t tied to a particular deployment environment or how the script loader works under the hood.<p>I wish there was a more natural way for logical components on the page to declare the resources they need without mixing code and metadata.  HTML Web Components, for example the [Polymer project](<a href=""http://www.polymer-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polymer-project.org/</a>), are possibly a step in the right direction, but I don&#x27;t think they address intelligently lazy-loading requirements.",1380753802

Kim Schmitz is show repeatedly to be concerned solely with maximizing the value of the content Mega stores to users. The operators of Megaupload are repeatedly shown to be aware of specific infringing content --- sometimes because they themselves used it, sometimes because their users pointed it out, and in some cases because they paid to have it put there.<p>Agree with everything you wrote except the above. Basically the disagreement is on the source materials - one is a naive Viacom and the other is an indictment. So I think the indictment is cherrypicked &quot;better&quot; than Viacom managed.<p>If e.g. the FBI/DOJ were going after youtube I think they would have quoted more selectively than Viacom did.<p>Unless the full text of Mega&#x27;s emails are out there - I can&#x27;t be sure there&#x27;s no conflict, I&#x27;m sure someone could dredge up him ordering something taken down.<p>Again with &quot;repeatedly&quot; and &quot;specific&quot; - the youtube emails, for all their conflict are repeated and specific, many times. There&#x27;s also instances of youtube employee&#x27;s grabbing stuff from other sites and putting it there themselves, which mega are accused of. I&#x27;m pretty sure with youtube&#x27;s channel system, copyrighted content is paid to be put there in the same manner, though I&#x27;m not sure how youtube&#x27;s early users were compensated.<p>I doubt the thought occured to them to bring a criminal case against youtube - that&#x27;s one of the points I&#x27;m wildly speculating on - or if it was the case, lobbying stemmed it.<p>I&#x27;ll have a read of the ruling:\n(PDF) <a href=""http://www.legalbytes.com/uploads/file/Viacom-YouTube%20%28Google%29%20Copyright%20Infringement%20Ruling.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legalbytes.com/uploads/file/Viacom-YouTube%20%28G...</a>",1380752161

If you make $10MM selling illegal firearms, the proceeds of that operations aren&#x27;t &quot;yours&quot;; they&#x27;re assets generated by criminal activity.<p>You may be innocent of the charges.

There are lots of Websites out there that have awesome Mobile Experiences, this just (apparently) is not one of them.<p>But even with this said, I think it&#x27;s important to note that designing a great Mobile Experience is no easy task. To me, it all starts with the Viewport, which is not necessarily an easy thing to understand. It seems as though the original Use Case for the Viewport was to provide the capability of zooming, presumably to account for Websites that were/are not mobile friendly. Over time, it seems as though the preferred User Experience has shifted to a set (non-zoomable) Experience, which is common with Web Apps. In fact, many of today&#x27;s common Web Frameworks (example: Bootstrap, jQuery Mobile, etc), set the viewport to a 1.0 scale, and prevent zooming with the max and min scale set to 1.0, and/or an explicit user-scalable=no. So it stands to reason that there are grey areas between the original use case, and how people use it today. This could explain why some of the &quot;Bigger Name&quot; Websites still have Mobile Experiences that require Zooming. But this is still no excuse for the overall User Experience described here, which does not sound good. Just like an App, I believe that Websites (or Website Projects) should have someone dedicated to a User Experience role, which would identify some of the issues raised here, and solve them. When the Advertising in conjunction with the Design makes the Website un-usable, that really is sad.",1380752049

Again and again, the management of Youtube struggles with the copyright problem. Clear directives are given to remove full-length videos. The legality of clips from Comedy Central are constantly questioned. When Jawed Karim himself posts a copyrighted video, the rest of the team seems angry. And yes, repeatedly, the Youtube team is shown to be sensitive to the impact that copyright enforcement will have on their user stats.<p>There is no such conflict in the Mega emails. Kim Schmitz is show repeatedly to be concerned solely with maximizing the value of the content Mega stores to users. The operators of Megaupload are repeatedly shown to be aware of <i>specific</i> infringing content --- sometimes because they themselves used it, sometimes because their users pointed it out, and in some cases because they <i>paid</i> to have it put there.<p>Could there have been a criminal infringement charge leveled against Youtube? Based on this evidence, it looks like &quot;maybe&quot;. But would DOJ have won the case? Almost certainly not. Read the judgements in the Viacom case.

The other version will be more expensive and feature a 3D UI but won&#x27;t be released until at least next year. The screen itself is not 3D, but the front of the phone has 4 cameras placed on each corner of the phone, this is to track the user&#x27;s eyes/head and move the UI to give the impression of 3D. Similar to what iOS 7 is achieving simply by using the phone&#x27;s accelerometer. The advantage being that it&#x27;s not based on how the phone moves, but how the head moves.<p>2- They wanted to have it launched already but had difficulties with both software and hardware, and then lots of key players left the company - a common problem at Amazon is retention, having the lowest record of any tech company.<p>3- As a result, several engineers from other products have moved to the phone team, making other products severely short staffed.<p>4- They have done testing so the software ignores other faces next to you, this is to prevent the illusion from breaking if there are many people looking at the phone.<p>5- The phone might have image recognition so users can take a picture of any object and search the Amazon.com database for similar products. This is not the barcode scan that&#x27;s available already, but actual object recognition. This might allow them to sell the phone for cheaper since they&#x27;d make money off extra sales.<p>6- Current code-name for the product is &quot;Smith&quot;.",1380751277

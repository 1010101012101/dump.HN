It would have been a horrible idea; to save weight, airflow ran through the reactor core, spewing radionuclides out the exhaust and contaminating everything it flew over.

4144588,comment,4142376,4143636,1,0,kprobst,,,"> YardSale sounds to me like a more beautiful, mobile centered Craigslist<p>This emphasis on aesthetics gets banded around a lot every time someone releases a competitor to something else (""but look, it's more beautiful!""). However in this case I don't think it matters. eBay is cluttered and ugly to the point of being painful to use, yet people use it. Craiglist isn't winning any UI design prizes any time soon. But people use it in droves. Perhaps in this case time and money would have been better spent on effective viral or traditional marketing rather than on making the app pretty, because as some people are already pointing out, without that first minimum viable critical mass of buyers and sellers, this will get nowhere. Also, mobile only... seems really weird to me.",1340319554

I never encountered any resentment or bitterness - people seemed genuinely pleased that I was going to go to university.<p>However, it was relatively late in life (30s) that I actually realised that this kind of supportive background is <i>not</i> the norm and many people, especially from modest backgrounds, face actual hostility and discouragement from  when they try to ""get out of their box"". As my wife, who although she is now a succesful lawyer, came from a background where academic success was <i>not</i> encouraged has commented to me - success was easy for me because it was expected of me from an early age.<p>Sadly, for many people nobody expects them to succeed and so therefore they don't.

We forget that there is more than one way to solve this problem, and this is a particular solution with particular tradeoffs. I myself find Stack Overflow a bit unpleasant to contribute on; I always feel like it's a race, and it's very hard to separate one's desire to be helpful from one's desire to win points by playing the game faster or harder. It's easier and possibly more rewarding overall (just in terms of points) to focus on answering broadly, frequently and with speed than with quality.<p>As a man, and a not particularly competitive one, I don't know if what chafes me about it is also what chafes women, but I think there is definitely room for other interpretations of social question answering. Either deep changes or simply different reward schedules, combined with a different initial community, ought to produce a site with a completely different ""feel."" Whatever it is that women are reacting to about Stack Overflow, there is bound to be a different solution they would like better, and the competition between sites could be beneficial.",1340319503

4144576,comment,4141410,4144499,1,0,robomartin,,,"Here's opinion from the horse's mouth:<p><start quote>
Back in 1999, the mag asked Joy what inspired him to write vi:<p>What happened is that Ken Thompson came to Berkeley and brought this broken Pascal system, and we got this summer job to fix it. While we were fixing it, we got frustrated with the editor we were using which was named ed. ed is certainly frustrating.<p>We got this code from a guy named George Coulouris at University College in London* called em - Editor for Mortals - since only immortals could use ed to do anything. By the way, before that summer, we could only type in uppercase. That summer we got lowercase ROMs for our terminals. It was really exciting to finally use lowercase.<p>So we modified em and created en. I don't know if there was an eo or an ep but finally there was ex. [laughter] I remember en but I don't know how it got to ex. So I had a terminal at home and a 300 baud modem so the cursor could move around and I just stayed up all night for a few months and wrote vi.<p>Linux Mag then asked: ""So you didn't really write vi in one weekend like everybody says?""<p>No. It took a long time. It was really hard to do because you've got to remember that I was trying to make it usable over a 300 baud modem. That's also the reason you have all these funny commands. It just barely worked to use a screen editor over a modem. It was just barely fast enough. A 1200 baud modem was an upgrade. 1200 baud now is pretty slow.<p>9600 baud is faster than you can read. 1200 baud is way slower. So the editor was optimized so that you could edit and feel productive when it was painting slower than you could think. Now that computers are so much faster than you can think, nobody understands this anymore.
<end quote><p>This is from Bill Joy, who wrote vi.  The last line is very much on point and mirrors my point of view:  ""Now that computers are so much faster than you can think, nobody understands this anymore.""<p>Also:  ""I was trying to make it usable over a 300 baud modem. That's also the reason you have all these funny commands. It just barely worked to use a screen editor over a modem.""<p>If one was given the task to write a text editor today, even one without a GUI, I would be surprised if anyone reached for some of the things Bill had to do in the context of 300 baud modems and a terminal (not window, but physical).<p>In the context of large projects vi/vim don't offer any real measurable gains.  The fact that programmers who take the time to learn these tools feel good about them does not constitute proof of anything other than that fact.<p>Let's just agree to disagree and move on.",1340319195

It is deceptive, and while the deception may not harm every participant, it can harm some of them. As the saying goes, ""there is no such thing as a point of view from nowhere""; even if your fake accounts attempt to take on different arguments, they are always tainted by your experience and the value of the contribution suffers. If a person makes a decision based on the consensus among 20 contributors, but they are actually 2 contributors, I believe that an immoral deception has occurred, <i>especially</i> if that decision is major or important.<p>I suppose if all your comments were things like, ""Cool story, I'm glad you posted it"", there's not much of a problem, but that doesn't seem like it would really drive engagement.<p>I have been a member of sites that grow organically with [almost] no activity. You just have to find a group of people that don't necessarily mind a slower pace; it really only takes a relatively small base of active users to get a snowball going. I don't think resorting to astroturfing is a necessity and I do think there is a permanent taint on sites that gain success by dubious methodology like this instead of slower, truer organic growth.",1340319114

I propose that not one person can make that claim and that the popularity of vi/vim are purely tribal.<p>There's an interesting show on TV called ""Head Games"" (<a href=""http://news.discovery.com/human/new-tv-show-plays-head-games-dnews-nuggets-120601.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.discovery.com/human/new-tv-show-plays-head-games...</a>).<p>In this show they demonstrate, among other things, how tribal behavior can be taken to an extreme.  It is very hard for some to go against group behavior.  They show one example of a guy in a room that stands up when everyone else stands up and he doesn't even know why.<p>To some extent I believe that some of these tools are like that.  You work in a shop where the hot programmer swears by vi/vim and you adopt that without challenging any of it.  Very soon everyone is playing the same tune, facts be damned.  I happen to be one of those people that does not engage in crowd behavior.  This can be a blessing and a curse.  I never bothered to spend months on vi/vim because every time I used for days or weeks (out of not having other choices) I came out of it with the distinct idea that the whole thing was just short of lunacy.  In the context of the project that needed to be completed these tools offered no real advantages.  You are not going to impact the bottom line in any measurable way.<p>Put another way:  If you took two kids that knew nothing whatsoever about computers or programming and set out to teach them.  One is taught with modern mostly-GUI tools with ""conventional"" keyboard shortcuts while the other has to use command line and vi/vim.  Both of them have to complete the same project.  The vi kid would be absolutely smoked by the other kid in no time at all.  No question about it.<p>OK, how about a second project.  Maybe not smoked, but no significant gains would exist out of the vi camp.  Programming is far more about things that have nothing to do with text editing.  Projects are not late or buggy because of good or bad text editing tools.<p>I'd still like to see someone quantify the gains offered by vi/vim over the course of a project.",1340317645

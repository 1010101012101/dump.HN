If you heat a miles-long pipe of molten salt on one end, that heat will make its way to a temperature rise on the other end in surprisingly rapid fashion.  But this is only true when it is molten.  Naturally, if molten salt encounters its solid salt, the solid melts pretty easily to expand the volume of molten salt.<p>Molten salt stores quite a bit of energy in its phase change, and of course as a salt solidifies, it becomes more dense.  This means the top salt (at the collector) will always be the slowest to solidify.<p>Not sure where all this worry about ""freezing to death"" comes from.  The salt's effectiveness comes from its conduction, not its flow.",1338296275

If someone has to take an hour helping me get this done, it is unnecessary overhead.

4037182,comment,4036458,4036643,6,0,gecko,,,"The first 80% of getting that working is surprisingly easy; the last 80% is surprisingly hard.<p>I programmed in Smalltalk for years.  Smalltalk has similar issues: dynamic typing, dynamic method generation/handling via #doesNotUnderstand:, and so on.  Yet quite a few Smalltalk environments have accurate and useful autocompletion, on-the-fly documentation, and more.<p>How?  You get three freebies that end up covering <i>most</i> situations:<p><pre><code>  1.  Globals (which includes classes) are trivial to detect and centrally stored,\n      making it easy to pick up when a class is used in source code.  So we've\n      now got autocomplete for all static methods and class documentation.\n  2.  Most of the time, a variable is only actually assigned to once--or,\n      worst case, from one location.  After that, it's merely manipulated.\n      See what class is getting instantiated there (see above), and you've got\n      a great guess on what type you're dealing with.  (And, sadly, it's a\n      guess; ""Foo new"" *probably* gives you a new Foo, but it doesn't have to.)\n  3.  Most methods *either* only get implemented once, *or* specialize a\n      method whose parent calls ""self subclassResponsibility"".  So either\n      you've only got a single place to look-up, or you can hedge your bets\n      and show documentation for the version of the method that calls\n      ""self subclassResponsibility"" (i.e., the abstract one) and figure it's \n      applicable to the concrete instance.\n</code></pre>\nThese three rules (which can obviously be combined) end up working a surprisingly large amount of the time, and they're not ridiculous to implement.  Granted, Python has a harder time here in some cases (e.g., you have to parse all accessible Python modules to build up a constructor list, and you'll likely have higher method collisions in Python than in Smalltalk due to the lack of keyword-based messaging), but these techniques will go a long way to getting you where you need to go.<p>Past that?  Things get really hard.  Because Smalltalk's development and execution cycle is blurry, you can actually go further than the above rules by checking what types variables are in instantiated classes and methods, and turning your source-based guesses into statistics-based ones.  There's no equivalent mechanism in Python.  You could probably do something with an idempotent test suite and some hooks into the Python VM, but the problem gets much more complicated.  Doable?  Yes.  Likely to come from Light Table?  I'm not honestly sure, but I am sure that they'd have to be willing to get pretty dirty with Python to get there.",1338296130

Even their entire App Store ecosystem (representing tens of billions of dollars in revenue) nets them a profit but a few percent what they make off their hardware sales.<p>(Also, btw, as much as I disagree with Apple's decisions with respect to their platform, you are wrong about the experience issue: normal users would much rather have a single billing and support channel for all of their payments, and they get horribly confused when some of their purchases are direct to a developer and some aren't. It does not harm the experience of using an iPhone to have Dropbox bill through their App Store; it may harm Dropbox's experience, but that is irrelevant to Apple, as to them Dropbox's insistence to support multiple platforms is itself a mistake that will lead to poor customer experience of Dropbox.)",1338295515

I don't believe the author's use of the phrase is correct, though.  Cognates don't have to mean the exact same thing in the different languages - they just have to be derived from the same source.  So a ""false cognate"" actually would mean words that appear to have come from the same historical roots but don't really.  What makes ""return"" in Haskell a (true) cognate is something you mentioned - its name was chosen intentionally as a _metaphor_ for return in other languages, though it's not the same thing.<p>On the other hand, I think the article's point that it's tricky is valid.  The way it is usually used makes it appear that it is causing the procedure being defined to exit.  If a user thinks that's what it's actually doing (which they tend to do when coming from other languages), they will try to write things like ""when (i == 0) (return x)"", which does not mean what they think it means.",1338295312

Each reencode or transcode loses more data; even if the first encoding is transparent, it's very possible the second will have audible artifacts.

4037045,comment,4035476,4035885,2,0,tytso,,,"So break the DRM.  Amazon actually has one of the easier systems to break; actually at this point they are all easy with the exception of Apple's.<p>One of the things which hasn't been talked about as much is that the vendors who providing DRM (i.e., Apple, Adobe, B&N, etc.) have at best a mixed incentive towards improving their DRM to protect against its being breakage.  On the one hand, they know it's technologically impossible to provide a truly secure DRM, and ""fixing"" DRM to protect against the latest hole costs time in development, QA and deployment costs.   They also know that there are people (perhaps only a small minority, but growing) that will only buy digital content if they can break the DRM.   So when upgrade their DRM, they lose customers.   So from Amazon's perspective, whose main goal it is to increase market share and minimize costs, there is minimal reason to fix their DRM, even though they must know it's been broken.  (Perhaps not in a legal sense, since there are probably contractual obligations, but the technological surfs employed by Amazon weren't chosen for their stupidity; quite the reverse, actually.)<p>The flip side of the picture is that if you want to keep the digital content publishers on your side, and if you want them to agree to new forms of content and distribution, and especially if you want all of the members of the oligopoly which is, say, Hollywood, to sign a contract all at the roughly the same time, you need to keep your DRM secure.  Unlike Amazon, B&N, and Adobe, who pretty much have a stable situation with respect to the markets they want to service, and/or who aren't willing to play the long game, I hypothesize that Apple is trying to do new things with TV shows and Movies --- and while the Book Publishers may be at best ambivalent to DRM, Hollywood hasn't had their lunch eaten by Amazon or Apple (yet).   So Apple needs to stay on the good side of the MPAA.<p>This explains why the ebook-only DRM schemes haven't changed in a while, even though they've all been broken, while Apple is still religiously patching iTunes and IOS with modified versions of Fairplay, trying to stay a step ahead of Requiem.   It's also why I rarely buy digital content from Apple; it's too much of a hassle to determine whether or not Fairplay's DRM is broken this week.<p>The bottom line is that with the possible exception of the most book publishers, who are acting like deer stuck in headlights, most of the rest of the economic vendors (i.e., the DRM vendors, Apple, et. al.) are acting completely rationally, even though on the surface the way the DRM game has been played seems to be quite the opposite.",1338293165

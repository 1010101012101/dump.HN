Titanium Developer transmits analytics data every time you create/import/edit/delete/compile/test/install/distribute a Titanium project on your system.<p>To see the specific calls, just download titanium_developer and grep for Titanium.Analytics.featureEvent. If you do use Titanium and want to disable this, you should build a new version of Developer after adding the following line to tiapp.xml:<p><pre><code>  <analytics>false</analytics>\n</code></pre>\nOne last note: I don't make these points just to be mean-spirited.

In 1995 I switched briefly the Windows 95, and then, already disgusted and bored by Windows, switched to Linux.<p>I found that nearly <i>everything</i> I had loved about the Amiga and C64 culture was stronger and more vibrant in the Linux and Open Source world. The only negatives were that the graphics and sound capabilities of Linux at the time (and still do, honestly) lagged behind Windows significantly, making it difficult to think of it as a creators system, unless what you were creating was software. I suspect part of the reason I moved more and more into software development and IT-related work was partly because the system I loved to work with was simply not capable of doing music and audio on a professional level (and still isn't, despite near-heroic efforts on the part of a few developers; if the kernel can't maintain an audio stream that doesn't skip and sputter, it's impossible to ever produce great audio).<p>Anyway, Linux and Open Source is definitely the heir apparent to the Amiga and C64, and I know many people from those communities ended up in the Open Source world.",1301960999

It occurs to me, it's very likely that this ""cure"" would only work on stress related baldness, not necessarily genetic baldness.<p>PS. I also feel compelled to mention previous experience with stress related baldness in animals. A few years back, I adopted a ferret from a friend who was heading off to the marines and wouldn't be able to take care of it. The ferret in question was bald along it's tail due to stress (my friend also owned two dogs that would harass the ferret). In only a few weeks of taking ownership of the ferret the hair had returned to his tail. In other words, it would appear that stress related baldness cures itself in when stress is relieved. So again, I don't really see this medication as any actual direct benefit for balding men. It may perhaps work wonders in relieving stress but the hair regrowth is not a result of the drug its a result of stress relief. A subtle but important difference.",1301960888

I'm female.  I had crappy fingernails most of my life.  Then I got diagnosed with a serious medical condition (genetic, so I've had it all my life).  This serious medical condition significantly impacts the lungs.  It's common knowledge in the medical community that the lung damage shows itself as clubbing and cyanosis of the fintertips.  Getting my lungs healthier and improving my baseline health has caused me to have significant improvement in my fingernails.  I have the most lovely fingernails I've ever had in my life.<p>More directly related to the hair issue:  While very ill, I began going grey in my early 30's.  In hanging out on health lists, I heard that grey hair can be caused by a PABA deficiency and/or adrenal stress. I treated for both with supplements and dietary changes.  I am 45 (and have a life expectancy in my mid thirties, so in human terms I'm like the equivalent of an octogenarian :-P) and have less grey hair now than I did 10 years ago.<p>So I think all these ""silly"" concerns about ""looks"" are really rooted in more serious concerns about health.

2408964,comment,2408938,2408938,4,0,nostrademons,,,"How does his output and skills compare to the other developers?  And what type of product is your startup building?<p>There's a wide variety of working styles that can work out for startups.  Don't fall into the startup mythology of believing you have to work 7 days a week, 8-12 hours a day just for the sake of working all the time.  Over the long run, you end up being <i>less</i> productive than a team that takes a more measured pace, because you tend to get tunnel vision and miss big opportunities in the haste to get your current goals done.  Startups generally tend to be marathons, not sprints; that code you wrote at 3:00 AM in the morning early in your startup's history may end up killing it a year later when everything's been based off it and you find a flaw in the design.<p>OTOH, there are real cases when you need to crunch, and some startups (based on their product idea) need to crunch more than others.  If you're trying to capitalize on someone else's platform that just got to market, it really behooves you to be faster than everyone else.  The early iPhone and FaceBook app developers made a killing; the people who got in later, not so much.  If you're commercializing academic research, this isn't as much of a factor, because there are many few competitors with the specific technical skills needed to replicate your product.  Same if you're in a niche market that requires lots of specialized domain knowledge.<p>Regardless, you need to work out the expectations with your cofounder ASAP.  If one of you expects to be working constantly and the other wants weekends off to be with his girlfriend, that's going to be a problem.  It may not mean he's unsuitable for startups, but it probably means he's unsuitable for <i>this</i> startup.  I've turned down cofounder positions because the level of intensity that the other cofounders wanted was very different from what I could sustain; that's just a bad situation waiting to happen.",1301958552

2408957,comment,2408363,2408363,4,0,danilocampos,,,"Tony Hsieh has fascinating discussion on outsourcing in Delivering Happiness. They could have outsourced two big parts of their business:<p>- Their telephone support<p>- Their fulfillment center<p>These are both things that, typically, are very expensive to run. The temptation to outsource is huge. The trouble is, these are also two of the most crucial interaction points for customers. So if they don't work correctly, the business will suffer.<p>What Zappos discovered was that by outsourcing, they ceded a lot of control and insight into their business to other parties who didn't really give a damn whether Zappos succeeded or not. Outsourcing fulfillment almost destroyed them because aligning incentives and priorities with outside parties is so very difficult.<p>When they returned to doing fulfillment themselves, they figured out a bunch of ways they could not only do it well, they could do it in a way that was so surprisingly good that people were blown away and told all their friends.<p>Similarly, by maintaining control over their phone support, they could make sure everyone answered the phone in a way that took care of each customer thoroughly. No operators hurrying people off the lines to keep their scores up, reasonable autonomy to make people happy. As a Zappos employee, immersed in the day to day of Zappos' business, they reflected the internal culture to everyone they talked to. This would be hard to do through an outsourced firm.<p>So can you outsource UX? Even software development? Sure. Maybe at first. But eventually, your company is going to need to have an internal understanding of these things. If your success is tied to UX but it's nowhere in the heads of your people or in your company's DNA, eventually you're going to lose out on opportunities that come to you only when people are invested exclusively in your success.<p>Eventually you're going to have the crap beat out of you by a company in another city made out of two guys who really know UX <i>and</i> code and iterate all night and all weekend because they don't have to haggle with anyone to reach perfection.",1301958383

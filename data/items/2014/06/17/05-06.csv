7903033,comment,7901139,7902906,1,0,h1karu,,,"> Science only claims correctness in light of current knowledge, within certain error bars.<p>I concur, but my point is that with regard to the mechanics and composition of the universe in which we live it would seem that the more we measure the larger those error bars appear to be.  Every once in a while measurements come along which multiply the size of those error bars exponentially and once that happens scientists should take note to adjust the English language they use in characterizing the limitations of their own knowledge.  Modern scientists seem to be notoriously slow at this and my suspicion is that this is because it would give the impression that certain fields of science are becoming less knowledgeable as time goes on, and that&#x27;s not good PR.  In other words my only complaint here is related to sociology, the use of language.<p>Thank you for prompting me to refresh my memory on the differences between mathematics and scientific inquery because in so doing I ran across a quote having to do with the role of the theorist (my favorite) who is caught between the two worlds:<p>&quot;Before an experiment can be performed, it must be planned — the question to nature must be formulated before being posed. Before the result of a measurement can be used, it must be interpreted - nature&#x27;s answer must be understood properly. These two tasks are those of the theorist, who finds himself always more and more dependent on the tools of abstract mathematics. Of course, this does not mean that the experimenter does not also engage in theoretical deliberations. The foremost classical example of a major achievement produced by such a division of labor is the creation of spectrum analysis by the joint efforts of Robert Bunsen, the experimenter, and Gustav Kirchoff, the theorist. Since then, spectrum analysis has been continually developing and bearing ever richer fruit.&quot;\n— Max Planck<p>&#x27;The Meaning and Limits of Exact Science&#x27;, Science (30 Sep 1949), 110, No. 2857, 325.

The story argues that taxis actually spend a disproportionate amount of time on the street, relative to other cars, and so have a disproportionately large effect on the overall city congestion. This is because cars drive point-to-point but taxis stay on the street all day.

When I have thrown parties in the past, I never considered hiring a security guard because of the difficulty in obtaining one. Time, not cost, was my limiting factor. I could justify hiring a guard through Bannerman for future events.<p>The difficulty is expanding to the corporate market. Recurring security services lack opacity - for instance, a night guard at an office. The main opportunity for Bannerman is targeting non-recurring security needs - the current service does not hit that sweet spot of the Uber model between consumer and business markets.

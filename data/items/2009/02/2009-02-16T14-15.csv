Definitely more expensive though. I think there are even graphics cards for the ExpressCard slot these days, though that won't help on a non-pro MacBook or an iMac. Note: I've never used these things, and I have no affiliation with Matrox.",1234796360

The Heat had two, the Celtics had 3.<p>While I love Posey (Celtics fan here), it takes a foundation of superstar talent first to even have a chance.<p>Many people take for granted the 20-30 points, that the team scoring leader puts up every night, and start to look elsewhere for that magic winning element.  Without the consistent play of the scorer (and the attention that draws from defense) guys like Posey would be exploited by a good team.",1234796336

More specifically:<p>Edit: Pick a social, religious, ethnic, and or age group you would rather be randomly dropped off in 1908 than 2008.<p>1) I strongly disagree.<p>2) Divorce rates have increased but the length of the average marriage stayed fairly constant.  People divorce has basically replaced death which IMO is an improvement.<p>3a illegitimacy) This is part of a trade off where marriage is less important.<p>3b inner city crime rates) this has to do with concentrating relative poverty.  Overall violent crime keeps falling and intercity poor of 2008 is far better off than poor of 1908.<p>4) I don't know what your talking about.<p>5) Is improving by every measurement.  Have you looked at dropout rates from 1908?<p>6) That's debatable, I think taxes are far more useful now than they where in 1908 and most people are far more wealthy after taxes.  When the value of the average person's after tax income is so much higher then it's hard to say taxes are a problem.<p>7) People on welfare today are far better off financially than the average worker from 1908.  Directly comparing an unemployed person of 2008 with an unemployed person of 1908 seems to be missing the point.<p>8) Is this just a matter of taste or is there an actual problem?<p>9) Our military threats have changed, but considering we where about to go to WWI I think we are probably far more safe today.<p>10) Stronger now than it was in 1908.<p>PS: Then again I could just be a child of my age, I might prefer now to the world 100 years from now.

483028,comment,482772,482915,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Plus, distributed protocols are significantly harder to engineer. You have to design for the case where the remote provider of Function X isn't up, or doesn't scale, or will decide to hate you if you send it too much traffic. You have to formalize many APIs and fix them in stone, <i>much</i> earlier in the process than you otherwise would, because now you've got external services that will depend on those APIs and will break if you change them. This will tend to make big, open, distributed systems much less flexible and harder to evolve over time.<p>When you combine <i>that</i> with the fact that most customers just don't care -- not until after they've got a lot invested in your site, at which point you're probably already a big success -- it's not surprising that the sites which evolved into big winners did so by keeping themselves fairly insular. Why spend money and time developing features that aren't important?<p>I'm not holding out hope for distributed versions of things like Facebook. Not yet. It's not unimaginable that the user community will eventually embrace such things, after they've had a lot more training in the downside of walled gardens, but I think we're way too early in the Web 2.0 adoption cycle for that. Right now I'd settle for a baby step: An export API that lets you dump all your data out of a service in some sort of JSON or XML format. That would be unusable for 99% of people, but at least it would let them back up their data and hand it to some third party that might be able to read it for them.",1234795875

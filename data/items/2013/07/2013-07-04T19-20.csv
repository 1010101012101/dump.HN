5992212,comment,5991381,5991735,2,0,jeffdavis,,,"&quot;Choices have consequences. But we rarely see the many possibilities a choice can yield, let alone the probable weightings of each one.&quot;<p>But we can do things to steer people toward good decisions or bad decisions. Your argument is a little too deterministic/fatalistic, as though things just kind of happen.<p>Directly applying empathy to policy sometimes steers people toward bad decisions. That&#x27;s just the unfortunate reality of incentives; in some cases worse than others.<p>One way of steering people toward good decisions is to expose them to some of the consequences of their bad choices. That has some major advantages: (1) it&#x27;s easy to implement and fairly natural; (2) it doesn&#x27;t require central planning; (3) it preserves a lot of freedom to make a wide variety of choices, not all of which have to be perfect. Unfortunately, it also has the disadvantage that mistakes and misfortunes cause major problems -- not just for the individuals, but also for the rest of society.<p>I believe the best trade-offs are when social assistance is provided by the most local organization that can provide it, starting with the immediate family and going up to about the size of a U.S. state at most. In a family or community, social assistance comes after years of listening to advice and with many social strings attached (usually by the more successful community members). The advice helps avoid the need for assistance; the social strings are a deterrent from bad choices and help people get back to making good decisions.<p>For example, reproductive choices vary widely between cultures, and I believe that&#x27;s a caused by things like taboos and shame. Of course, taboos and shame have their own problems because they are applied imprecisely and are sometimes outdated. Sometimes, that results in even worse decisions, like staying in an abusive relationship or not entering a good one. I didn&#x27;t claim to have all the answers.",1372967922

I am still playing around with crouton, I haven&#x27;t installed chrubuntu yet, but it seems like it might be a better option.<p>Another thing that I have been looking at is online IDEs. I have tried codenvy.com and devtable.com. These both look promising, but I have used my quota of Google Appengine Apps trying them out. I have to wait a few more days to really give them a good try.<p>The real reason I bought another computer was to replace my original laptop. It was perfectly fine except the screen broke. I would have fixed the screen, but I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what the problem was and it would cost as much as a Chromebook.<p>I ended up getting the Acer C7 model with 2GB of RAM and a 16GB ssd. Overall, I am satisfied, but I am figuring somethings out. If nothing works, I can remote desktop into my old laptop.<p>I would recommend the Acer over the Samsung because the Acer is much more fixable and upgradeable. I plan on adding either 4 or 8GB of ram to this. I might also swap out for a plain 250GB laptop hard drive. The battery is also swappable, but the 4-5 hours I get is enough for me.",1372967877

5992183,comment,5988184,5988668,1,0,necro,,,"I know many services block or negatively rate connections coming from hosting providers.  Personally we see that most of the spam attempts are via cheap VPSs.  I&#x27;m not sure if they actually hack these or simply just purchase a $9/month host, install VPN, and go to work on spam.
Our system keeps track of all netblocks and the companies they belong to and we classify those so our site can take action accordingly.  Normally we just alert mods if a new user is created or a new first post is placed by a user originating from one of these hosting companies so it can be checked. Banning access totally from these would leviate some work.
My personal experience has been that access to my site via VPN services or ips belonging to hosting providers, are mostly spammers.
I think that eventually everything will go anonymous and that will make it much harder to detect and filter spam/fraud.  It&#x27;s going to take smarter tools and changes on sites to detect spam/fraud by usage patterns instead of source.
The sad part is that these changes will effect all legit users negatively in order to try to prevent the few bad apples.",1372967439

We like our freedom in our family. We are not afraid to go out in public and express our opinions on public policy in the view of onlookers, cameras, and the police.

It&#x27;s not about &quot;cheating&quot;. To me, I view it as &quot;I can&#x27;t be bothered to learn /how/ this works, I&#x27;ll just use a library&quot;. I can make a half-assed HTTP library, but in production, I&#x27;d obviously use a real library. The important thing is I understand on a more intimate level how HTTP works. That is invaluable in debugging as when I ask myself &quot;why isn&#x27;t this working&quot;, I can think back to my own code and it often helps to shape my understanding. I can think how the machine thinks as I taught it how.<p>I&#x27;ll often study other systems while building my own. It&#x27;s all part of the learning process to me.<p>It also provides deep appreciation for the effort that&#x27;s poured into libraries.<p>I&#x27;ve also done the same thing on the web; I used XMLHttpRequest and DOM apis for years before I started using jQuery. I&#x27;ve never had a single complaint but I&#x27;ve seen programmers who have gone right into jQuery and surrounded themselves with abstraction and have had no idea how the system is behaving and they get confused and frustrated. This leads people like me to view libraries as bad; they are preventing people from learning how their systems work.<p>Programmers today seem so lazy. I&#x27;m not really sure if that&#x27;s the right word. I see people using HTML 5 Boilerplate and they never seem to ask &quot;Why is the meta charset before the title tag?&quot;. I did. Now I know about UTF-7 XSS vulnerabilities. I spent most of my day reading up on charset vulnerabilities. With that knowledge, I patched several projects of mine. Sure, people using Boilerplate would be protected but they wouldn&#x27;t really know what from.<p>Perhaps I just think differently to other programmers.

Madison was his secretary of state.<p>Here is his reasoning:<p>&quot;You seem to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions; a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men, and not more so. They have, with others, the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps.... Their power [is] the more dangerous as they are in office for life, and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves&quot;<p>It&#x27;s difficult to consider the counter-factual of the court not being created and common law having been continued, but it&#x27;s useful to understand that there was opposition, and why, so that if you support it, you can use this knowledge to make it better.<p>In more modern times, partisanship does seem to be a problem, with many of the most important decisions are made 5-4 on party lines.<p>As you have brought up, another problem is that, contrarily, that it may be that the supreme court isn&#x27;t actually not be powerful enough. If the U.S. is using the U.K. to spy on Americans, isn&#x27;t that a blatant end-run around the constitution? But where can standing be, if legal opinions are based on secret courts, and gag orders are imposed on everything?<p>At the same time, it&#x27;s not &quot;Just the supreme court&#x27;s&quot; job to uphold the Constitution. Ultimately, it&#x27;s the people&#x27;s, and our most direct representatives are the House.

Once configuration is done, all the user needs to know to reach _all_ of their data is a URL and a password. The server itself can (ultimately) become the identity service for all remote accounts.<p>It has a straightforward progression of development and adoption, too. Create a web app that kludges together some messaging, identity, and storage solutions - the stuff needed to do this at an 80% level already exists, for the most part. Package it into an image installable on a VPS. Subsequently, make native apps for the client devices, or adapt existing ones, to match the experience of Dropbox/GTalk/etc. Last, build a hosting service or sell hardware tailored around simplifying the configuration process, providing backups, etc. As you get further into the adoption process, more and more possibilities to reclaim data open up, since you&#x27;ll hit the critical masses necessary to push new protocols into the system.",1372966047

But you can make MUCH MORE MONEY writing software. In the early 2000&#x27;s when I was a sysadmin jobs in my area were paying 40k-60k a year. Programming jobs were paying 60k-100k.

5992047,comment,5989368,5990067,2,0,HalfPriceDigi,,,"It seems that your argument then is that no one should ever be able to resell or give away anything that they buy ever.  So when you buy something, anything at all, you would have to own it yourself until you throw it away.  Obviously that would have a huge negative impact on the environment with items like cars, computers, clothes, etc.  Also, the lack of a second-hand market would have a negative impact on low-income people who need to buy used goods for the lower prices.  So it seems to me that your argument against the existence of any second-hand market would have disastrous effects and cannot exist in the real world.<p>You have avoided the issue of whether or not second-hand markets positively impact the primary market.  For example, if people weren&#x27;t able to sell their used cars, would they be more or less likely to buy new cars.  I think that the answer is pretty obvious.  If people couldn&#x27;t resell their used cars ever, they would buy new cars less often.  Mainly because people often partially pay for new cars by trading in or selling their old cars.<p>I agree with namlem&#x27;s comment &quot;Why does incurring the costs associated with resale on the industry in any way morally gray? It&#x27;s the manufacture&#x27;s right to price items accordingly. They can just raise it to compensate.&quot;  The manufacture should simply price the existence of a resale market into their product.  That&#x27;s what ever merchant other than Steam already does.<p>Steam is breaking the law in the EU and their illegal business model (not allowing resales) is what allows them to undercut the prices of their competitors.  Don&#x27;t you find that to be a moral grey zone?<p>The problem with making the argument, as I suspect you are, that because games are intellectual property that they shouldn&#x27;t be able to be resold when you are done with them, is that almost everything is intellectual property.  Think of how many parts of your car are patented.  Those patents are intellectual property.  If you let Steam say that you don&#x27;t own the games that you buy then you opening the floodgates to a world where you don&#x27;t own anything that you buy - you are just &quot;licensing&quot; it.  As I&#x27;ve stated above a world like that isn&#x27;t practical and I don&#x27;t believe it is morally correct either.  It restricts the rights of consumers for no reason other than to further enrich the producers of goods, who many doing just fine as is.  Valve is worth 2.5 Billion dollars.

Yes, of course, there will naturally be some people that would take the 10k and live on it - as best as can be managed - but I think it would free up a great many other people to pursue work they&#x27;re actually interested in, especially in the arts.<p>In past times, the majority of human work was growing food. Today, less than 2% of the population can feed everyone else. As a result a great many people had to find other work; and they did. But now it seems that software and automation will reduce the number of people needed to do all other kinds of required work to a minimum, as happened to agriculture.<p>Coincidentally, artistic work by and large pays less than ever today due to the ease of piracy (you can trace the profits of RIAA over the last 3 decades for a good example of this) even as more people than ever are able to do artistic work (better tools) and reach an audience at no cost (better communications).

It&#x27;s obvious from the wording of the replies of those who are more sympathetic and those who are less sympathetic to those mentioned in the article.  Look at the wording:<p>&quot;poor choices...empathy...choices have consequences...we make mistakes...morality of altruism&quot;, &quot;The country I grew up in....Jobs are the result of innovation and entrepreneurship&quot;, &quot;morally competent&quot;, &quot;how much of your income would YOU like to give to the heroes&quot;<p>Not much rational analysis.  Just a sermon, or morality tale, or an abbreviated Ayn Rand screed against altruism, which might as well be a religious sermon.<p>Poverty is an essential cornerstone of the current economic system.<p>There have been many economic systems over the millenia - hunter-gather societies, then slave societies, then feudal societies, then capitalist societies.  From the philosopher Hegel to Francis Fukuyama we&#x27;ve had intellectuals say our current economic system is the last one.  From the 19th century on, some have said other economic systems might become predominant in the future, particularly socialist ones.<p>Capitalism is the only economic system where poverty is necessary.  When a company&#x27;s revenues exceeds its capital expenses, the money has only two places to go - profit or wages.  If there was full employment, strong unions, no laws banning secondary strikes like Taft-Hartley etc., workers would get more and more in wages until profits disappeared.  When companies have the lever to send workers into poverty, they become happy &quot;just to have a job&quot;.  This allows for companies to make workers work longer hours for less money, or to put in a more strenuous effort during the time worked.<p>Everything can be discussed rationaly, but when discussing how poverty exists in capitalism in a manner it did not in feudalism, or prior economic systems (or possible future ones), words like &quot;morality&quot; are brought out.  People can rationally discuss VCs and valuations and options.  But rationality has to go out the window when discussing how poverty exists in the current economic system, we have to get a sermon, rational discussions of the topic are not allowed.<p>Also a look at history is not allowed.  That our economic system is just one in a chain of systems, and that &quot;socialism&quot; is still a bugaboo of the people moving the levers of our economic system is a sign of this.  Capitalism is new historically as a dominating system, and has very shaky elements, so you want to make people forget that...in Europe countries are still under feudal trappings.  That in the the 1930s, the capitalist west had its factories lying dormant while the USSR couldn&#x27;t build factories fast enough.  And so forth.  You want to forget that the property in the US was stolen from Indians, or even the property in Poland or Ireland stole from the Polish and Irish.  You want to forget  Africans were dragged to the US in chains and set to work in stolen Indian property.  That even the property accumulated from the profit made off these people after is similary ill-gained.  And that this all happened historically recent, relatively.  History has to be forgotten to, even fairly recent history.  It&#x27;s a topic which can&#x27;t bare rational analysis or a look at recent history.  Some type of moral sermon is all that&#x27;s called for.  Not just the &quot;heartless conservatives&quot; but the &quot;bleeding-heart liberals&quot;.  Mawkish calls for the poor to be fed for moral reasons is just as silly as moralistic claims that the poor are lazy.",1372964451

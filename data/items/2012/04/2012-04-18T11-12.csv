3857485,comment,3856764,3857319,4,0,ars,,,"> The reason why they may be using the wind turbine directly is if they're using mechanical energy to fire the compressors, etc to run the process.<p>The gearing would make this too complicated. A compressor wants a constant force, with a varying speed. But a turbine produces a varying force. (This can be adjusted somewhat by angling the blades, but not enough.) Older turbines run at a constant speed, the extra force allows more electricity to be generated. Newer ones are more complicated running at varying speeds. But in both cases the force varies, which would not work for a compressor.<p>You don't need to both compress the air, and refrigerate it - it's either/or.<p>If you compress the air, the cooling is just ambient cooling. A way to capture that energy is pretty important. It would be easy to capture the energy in the compression of the air, but once you cool it the pressure drops which is a waste. Maybe dump the heat after the expansion to increase the pressure of the air before using it?<p>The gearing of this system would be pretty complicated - you have energy from the turbine, then energy from the compressed air releasing. I guess a differential gear would work.<p>Refrigeration is a lot simpler in some ways (after condensing the water, use the cold to help cool the hot side) but designing a refrigeration pump to run at varying speed is really hard. And varying force is no good either.<p>You don't need reverse osmosis for the filtration - the water is quite clean, it just has some dust in it which a simple filter could handle. May be easier to filter the air instead.",1334749761

Sure, it is not something you can measure like market capitalization or dividends, but that doesn't make it insignificant.<p>It is common for people to say that all big companies are equivalent in that they just look for the best strategy to maximize shareholder value, which they have to do by law. I don't think that's the complete picture: there are humans behind every company, behind every decision they make. If  Larry Page and Sergey Brin believe in an open Internet, that  will strongly influence what strategy among many they choose to maximize shareholder value. Well, as long as they have a controlling stake, which might be for a long time seeing the recently announced stock split.<p>But it's not only board members who determine how open a company is. For example, developers have their say in what technology or protocol will be used for a particular project. What they propose might depend on their personal views, and what passes as a valid argument (e.g. openness or standard compliance) depends on company culture. Personal views and company culture obviously depend on who gets hired, and that's a matter where anyone (developer, HR, etc.) might have a say. If Google employees have a bias towards hiring people who embrace open technologies, that will have an effect. And if Google's image tends to attract job applications from people who believe in an open Internet, that will also have an effect.

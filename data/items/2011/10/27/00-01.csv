For new movies, sure, theaters only. For newly released DVDs, sure, stores and/or rentals only. \nBut 6 months to a year after release, I expect every company to put their content online so that it's convenient for people to watch instead of relying on the $5 bargain bin for revenue. That's what makes sense to me yet it doesn't happen. They pull content left and right for what? So Netflix can't be the sole provider of the content? What makes sense to me is AMC putting the first several seasons of ""Breaking Bad"" on Netflix so that all can watch it to catch up to the current season on air. Do other programs expect people to purchase DVDs for a single view to catch up?<p>Ideally for me there should be company B and company C to compete with Netflix, each with its own set of exclusives from different companies, each with a ~$10/month no contract charge for viewership.

3161103,comment,3159382,3160964,5,0,kkowalczyk,,,"There are several reasons why AWS does (and should) cost more than a generic solution.<p>1. If you just look at the cost of bandwidth and hardware, there's no doubt you can find cheaper solutions in the commoditized basic hosting market. AWS solutions, however, remove a lot of manual work that goes into setup, configuration and maintenance of servers. If you're a startup, it costs you (a lot of) money to hire those people. It also cost you time wasted not working on the core of your service. Up to a certain size, the fixed costs of additional personnel heavily outweigh higher bandwidth costs. Evernote and Stackoverflow have extremely high traffic and might have crossed the threshold at which it's profitable for them to look for savings in hosting bill. A vast majority of startups is not in that position.<p>2. Unique services demand a premium. Most of the hosting companies provide commoditized services. AWS is much more unique.<p>3. Services higher up the stack demand a premium. The most basic hosting service offers you a bit of physical space in their building and only give you power for the server and network connectivity. Amazon provides a wide variety of services on top of that. Developing those services and keeping them working is much more costly than just ensuring power is on and network is up. They have to charge more (they have higher costs) and they can charge more (they provide a richer service).<p>4. Ultimately, the prices are set by the market. We can't really say anything about whether Amazon is more efficient at using hardware or power than, say, SoftLayer, based on their prices. First, their services cost much more to provide. Second, they are free to set their margins at whatever level they please. They could run the service at a loss or they could charge an outrageous premium. We don't know. People are clearly willing to pay for AWS services so at the very least they've set the prices in a way that, given additional benefits, is competitive with traditional server hosting.",1319675999

This is arguably okay for ""personal property"", but what that quote is really referring to is ""private property"": land, factories, ""the means of production"". What characterises ""private property"" is that the entity which has the right to prevent others from using the ""property"" (the owner of the land or boss of the factory) is not the entity which actually uses the ""property"" (the workers in the factory or the people who actually work on the farms, or mine the mines, or whatever).

AppCode doesn't tout itself as a beautiful Mac application. It's written by developers for developers. We have a saying at my office: 'If you can't code, it's likely that you care about pixel perfection.' I care about getting stuff done. I don't care about how pretty my application is when I'm getting the job done. I like things that increase my velocity (in my case over 50%). I feel like Xcode just gets in the way many times. Simple things like not being able to have the cursor in the middle of a line and be able to simply add a line under the current line (vi lovers: think 'o' from the middle of a line). In Xcode you have to go to the end of the line and hit enter. That is one trivial example of a time saver that AppCode offers. (There are MANY).<p>Instead of whining about pixel perfection, try taking a look at the things it does and the audience it targets. You probably don't code enough to actually have an opinion that matters much anyway.",1319674591

For example, the cost to every Emacs user of adding a new major mode customized for some obscure programming language is negligible because all Emacs users already have to know about and adapt to whatever complexity is required to support n major modes. (I am not sure, but I suspect that approximately the same thing applies to drivers in Linux.)<p>Well, it is a little more complicated than that because catering to a small market tends to have lower expected revenue than catering to a market that might become very big. That is a minor reason for not catering to any and all feature requests, but I believe that the major reason is that it tends to make things more complicated for the majority.",1319674573

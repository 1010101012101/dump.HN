They are great for the limited number of people who happen to snag one of these over-paying jobs, but they are not so great for all the other people whose skills are not worth that amount, and are thus made unemployable.<p>And, as you can see in basically every position where government hasn't mandated that employers pay some minimum wage, organizations do not choose to pay people zero.  Ever.  They choose to pay people just enough to perform the work that needs doing.  Sometimes that number is $10 per hour, sometimes that number is $24,000,000 per year.",1336672787

I agree that it's a different situation.<p>My point is that I was able to make an informed decision to take an unpaid position, and it benefited me. Had it been a paid position, it either wouldn't have been offered (the department didn't have a lot of money) or would have gone to someone else with more experience. So when people advocate for unpaid internships to be banned, I get frustrated, especially when they say it's for the intern's benefit.<p>Don't get me wrong, it absolutely sucks that it's possible (market-wise) to hire university grads for nothing, but banning unpaid internships doesn't solve the underlying market problem. And I'd argue that it doesn't increase social mobility, either, since floor/ceiling prices tend to encourage nepotism.",1336672693

3954908,comment,3952774,3954064,2,0,rbanffy,,,"> one must literally buy Apple hardware to test in an Apple environment.<p>You have to consider the total cost. If the Apple hardware lasts longer, requires less maintenance and makes the developers more productive, it may end up very well paying for itself. My wife uses a Mac and just the time I didn't spend fixing, cleaning and disinfecting a Windows install more than paid for the price difference between her MBP and a cheap Dell. Compare it against a similarly well built machine and things look even worse for the PC. Her current Mac (a 13"" i7 MBP) survived a car crash in early March (the machined body is very slightly warped and it'll probably have to make a visit to an Apple dealer for that). Her previous one, a 2006 white MB, sits on my desk as my secondary computer and is our main source of ambient music. It had an aesthetic problem, which was fixed by Apple for free (because other parts had to be replaced due to a recall) last March. It replaced a (still working flawlessly) 1998 iMac in that function. You can say anything about those machines except that they aren't built to last and that their customer service isn't stellar.<p>If I had to use my Dell with Windows, I know I would be far less productive than I am under Linux. I know because I tried (from 2008 to 2010).<p>Unless you are developing for Windows (something that pretty much implies you are running Visual Studio), I wouldn't advise you to use Windows as your development platform. And, if you aren't, it's only natural that testing on Windows incurs an extra cost.<p>Having said that, it shouldn't be that complicated to set up Windows VMs to run automated Selenium-driven tests and plug those into Jenkins.<p>If you test manually, you are doing it wrong.",1336672595

However, I can say that throughout the field I consistently run into dentists who will advocate for the health of the patient over the profit of the business.  Consider the fluoridation of water throughout the world, one of the single greatest public health advances, when you take into account the benefits versus the cost of fluoridation.<p>But the science of it: I'm excited by the tooth growing possibilities, but it's important to understand that getting these teeth properly integrated into the body is quite a challenge.  I'll give you an example: the periodontal ligament is like a very precise shock absorber attaching bone to tooth, and gives some flex to the tooth. (It's also the thing that makes orthodontics (moving teeth) work in the first place.) Sometimes, (usually in younger folks) if you knock a whole front tooth out, you can immediately replace it and the PDL will regenerate.  Sometimes, however, the PDL fails to regenerate, and you end up with a situation where the tooth is ankylosed -- the ligamentous connection is gone, and the tooth is essentially fused to bone.  This is one of the difficulties that will need to be overcome when regenerating teeth -- if that PDL fails to develop, you're stuck with a newly regrown tooth fused to bone. Thus, the tooth is more susceptible to breaking and _really_ difficult to extract from the mouth if it becomes infected.",1336671743

When I first started created digital imagery, back in the late 1970s, there was barely any commercial hardware, in the modern sense, and essentially no commercial software. We dug out the math and physics books and rolled our own.<p>My background is in fine arts; my degree is in painting, drawing and print making.  Image making is a very old technology. Leonardo's notebooks have a lot of good advice for modern web designers. So do the 19th century impressionists.  Add in the fact that I'm an amateur astronomer with an interest in optics and the human visual system, and I've got a pretty useful toolbox for making things that people need to look at.<p>I read the article you mention, and thought it was cute.  What a lot of web developers don't realize is that if your visual design doesn't work, then that's one thing that's broke about your project.  Visual design doesn't necessarily mean ""pretty"" or ""pleasing to the eye"", though that never hurts. Visual design means that your work is communicating correctly and efficiently.<p>Think about designing a billboard or a 10 second TV commercial. You've got a <i>very</i> narrow window of opportunity to grab someone's attention, amidst all the other distractions, get your message across, and hopefully initiate some kind of action or memory response.<p>The biggest problem with some designers is that in order to perform in a highly competitive environment they have to become very specialized and attuned to a particular medium and a particular set of requirements.  If they've never worked in other mediums they may think that the specialized rules and needs of their medium are general rules.  I've seen print designers create billboards that would look beautiful in a magazine spread, but would be a messy blur on the side of the highway as you went zooming past.<p>I've worked in print, broadcast, movie special effects, animation, multi-media, display, web, charcoal, oil and acrylic paint, silkscreen, wood engraving, copper plat etching, and other even weirder mediums. I once had to design an ad that was to be silk screened onto walnuts.  Now <i>there's</i> a tricky venue to master ...<p>Back when I was teaching design and web development, one thing I would stress was that anyone working in a visual medium ought to learn to draw. Get Betty Edward's book <i>Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain</i> and go to town.  Learning to draw observationally is learning to <i>see</i>; and to see the whole picture, not just the part that happens to be under your pencil at the moment.

3954701,comment,3953592,3953592,78,0,aneth,,,"I have to land squarely on Square's side on this one. As far as I can tell, Square has handled this matter exactly as I would expect and hope. They communicated professionally and clearly with Jason. Jason responded with empty threats and demands, and clearly does not understand or respect his responsibilities in his business relationship. Getting money quickly from a merchant account is a privilege, not a right. That privilege is afforded in exchange for honoring the chargeback process, which for good reason initially favors the consumer by provisionally reversing the transaction. When a chargeback occurs - as clearly stated in Square's initial email - ""The respective financial institution notifies Square and debits the funds from Square.""<p>Chargebacks are not fun, but they are a fact of life. When a consumer challenges are credit card charge, the consumer is entitled by law and contract to have their case heard, and in the meantime the middlemen must make sure they won't be left holding the empty moneybag.<p>It is entirely reasonable for the Square to make sure funds are available to pay the consumer debt should the consumer prevail - Square will be out that money regardless of whether Jason pays up.<p>To be frank, based on his attitude, Jason seems like the sort of guy who would refuse to pay up if the dispute had been decided against him and he disagreed with the determination. This is exactly the reason Square was and always will be justified in freezing the amount associated with any chargebacks. There is a process for handling chargebacks that you submit your self to in exchange for the convenience of getting money quickly from the credit card system. That money is only yours if the consumer does not challenge the charge - usually they don't, but you are responsible to pay if they do, and you are responsible for funding your account to cover whatever level of chargebacks your business sustains.<p>It is entirely reasonable for:\n1) Square to freeze funds associated with chargeback attempts. At this point, Square is out those funds. \n2) Square to withdraw funds from a link account if the Square account is empty. It's the responsibility of the merchant to keep funds available to handle chargebacks, as I'm sure is clearly stated in their agreement. If the merchant has kept all funds out of reach of Square, by withdrawing all their money from the account and keeping the associated bank account empty, the merchant is indicating that they do not intend on fulfilling their end of the bargain on having a merchant account - namely honoring chargebacks and the determination process for chargeback disputes. If this withdraw results in NSF fees, particularly for a chargeback of such a small amount, that is the merchant's fault for not funding their account. Furthermore, NSF fees are easily avoidable by depositing funds the same day - why Jason did an electronic transfer is beyond me.<p>Based on Jason's ignorance of his own responsibilities, his refusal to keep money available to handle chargebacks, his empty and immature threats to ""go to the press"" among other things, and his general disregard for his role in the business relationship, I would expect Square probably wants to terminate his account, but will decide against that as it would be more bad PR than it's worth. They would be justified, however, holding funds for a longer period of time, since it's clear he refuses to keep funds available to handle chargebacks and to honor the largely fair chargeback process.<p>The only counter point I can think of is that, for a certain chargeback/total charge ratio, it does seem Square could take the risk and absorb any funds deficit. That is not traditionally how things work though, and since Square is doing their best to get merchants paid as quickly as possible, it only seems fair that merchants would do their best to ensure Square they intend to honor their end of the bargain. If Square did take on this risk for small chargeback amounts for merchants in good standing (say < 3% of total charges,) this would delay someone like Jason's understanding of the chargeback process until a real problem occurred - like a large number of customers demanding refunds.

Django ORM does exactly same thing.<p>author seemed to be concerned about these issues:<p>1. embedding businnes logic in views:<p>making query isn't business logic, business logic is in your database constraints or sometimes if db constraints are not enough then by overriding save() and validate(). queries belong in views because all we are suppossed to do in views is mearly fetch data from a data structure(already modeled according to biz. logic) and representing it as we see fit(thus the name views). theoretically this representations(views) could be of infinite types and changes over time so queries would change for every representation and over time but we can't go about implementing all possibilities in models. And this is what's antipattern because we are talking abaout putting views in models(partially though).<p>2. code reusability:<p>agreed, some queries could be repeted many a times and if complicated enough may clutter the code. I recommend putting querries into functions and put the functions in views or any similar aproach(I will think of one or you figure out one and share) but they just dont belong in models. although I believe full reusabilty can be achieved but in some cases if we can't- well we are choosing 'division of functionality' over 'reusability'.<p>and most important of all if django's documentaion does not suggest inherting for eg. queryset class then we shouldn't (even if you yourself coded the django framework) because these implementation details are supposed to be concealed and hence they are free to change it in future versions making our code 'upgrade-ugly'(if that's the right term)",1336670331

However, too often they read as though this is a new problem. The programmer stereotype used to be that we didn't know how to interact with women. Now we have a programmers objectifying women. I agree with you, the issue is larger than brogramming.<p>I suspect that the issue could be helped by having more female programmers. It's much more difficult to be bigoted (be it gender, sexuality, culture, etc) toward a group when you work with and respect a member of that group.

I can not. It seems to me that for this to have happened, many things must have gone wrong, or many professional practices must have been completely missing:<p>1.) there were no code reviews<p>2.) there were no unit tests<p>3.) there were no functional tests<p>4.) no one noticed any problems on the development site<p>5.) there was no QA person, or the whole QA team somehow failed to test this<p>6.) there were no 3rd party testing services that might have caught this (like Airbrake), nor any in house error logging services (errbit)<p>I could go on. I'm trying to imagine how a programmer comments out the $user variable and that change makes it all the way to production without anyone noticing. I think a lot of things have to wrong, all through the organization, before that becomes possible.<p>I read your story and I have 2 quick thoughts:<p>1.) I have made many worse mistakes (thought I was changing database password for dev, in the config file, but actually changed it for production)<p>2.) None of my worst mistakes ever made it to production, because the company had some process that caught them before such a change ever got pushed to production.<p>No programmer can avoid mistakes. That simply isn't possible. To insist that a programmer always write perfect code would be like insisting that an NBA basketball player make 100% of his 3 point shots: the world would be a very different place if it was possible to insist on perfection.<p>A well run organization has multiple checks that ensure mistakes made in development don't make it to production. Any organization that puts 100% responsibility on one programmer is taking a 100% certain risk that eventually some terrible mistake will make it to production.<p>Some organizations put more responsibility on individual programmers and some organizations put less. That is fine. A range of strategies can be defended. But if an organization wanted to shift most of the responsibility onto a single programmer, then they would also have to give that programmer broad latitude regarding time, so that the programmer can implement whatever they feel is necessary to ensure the robustness of the code (for instance, unit tests, functional tests, setting up automated uptime checks, etc). I'm guessing, from what few details are written above, that the above commenter both had responsibility for the code but was also under pressure to move quickly and shove stuff out the door. Under such circumstances, management needs to take 100% responsibility if something goes wrong.<p>Now I will qualify everything I said above with an anecdote: In 2005, when working at monkeyclaus.org, we had a little startup where I was the only programmer and we would push my changes straight to the ""live"" site. But we hadn't really launched yet and the few dozen users we had were just friends of ours, so the ""live"" site was really a ""dev"" site.",1336669912

In addition to simply being a rewarding thing to do, it is a good way to get even better at whatever you are teaching.<p>So when I was the production manager in charge of making a bunch of marketing sites for small insurance agencies, I called up one of the local universities.  They were quite happy (after some conversations with their faculty) to send me a student who was getting ready to graduate and who was interested in creating content for the web.<p>I didn't expect the intern to get any actual work done, just to kind of try and work through some of the projects that we were doing.  The work that I was giving him was pretty much the same work that the paid staff were getting, and although we actually did end up using elements of his designs he was much slower and had a much smaller skill set than someone I would actually hire.<p>However, after a semester of working with us, his markup, scripting, and associated skills were a lot better.  In addition to his own efforts, I spent time structuring his work assignments in ways that built from one topic to the next, and was available to critique his work in ways that he found useful.<p>So, this relationship was mutually beneficial: he is more skilled than he was, has at least some work experience to put down (other than food service), he received course credit (IIRC), and got a picture of what the inside of that kind of agency looks like.<p>For our part, we got a very small amount of marginal work, and for my personal part I improved my own scripting and CSS skills, in addition to simply enjoying working with folks who are learning.<p>Now, if we were just trying to fill a minimally skilled position with someone who was an employee and skim by calling them an ""intern"" instead of ""an exploited worker"", that would be different.<p>But I believe it is possible (though perhaps not likely) that unpaid, non-exploitative internship relationships can exist.",1336669798

The biggest thing that I think is different for my intern experience from what I hear about the horrors about unpaid interns is that I get money like a paid intern, but have the expectations of an unpaid intern. The people I work for aren't paying me, so they can't expect too much labor out of me. As far as they're concerned, their payment is in experience, so I basically got free reign to do (or watch other people do) many things that might not be productive, but I found interesting. The anecdotal evidence of my friends with paid positions had to really earn their pay and don't have anywhere near the freedom that I did.

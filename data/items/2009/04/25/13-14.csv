In this case, I'm pretty sure you can't dismiss it without reading all of it.  After finishing BC, do a careful re-read of Cryptonomicon.  You will find a lot of things that seemed inconsequential on the first read, have a huge backstory behind them and they mesh as smoothly as a planetary gearbox.  This is Neal Stephenson at his best.  You can really tell that he had the whole story in his head, he just chose to tell the modern-day one first.  I really hope he picks up this storyline again.  I liked Anathem but I really have burning desire to know more about the families in BC.\nIt's not a fast read and you need to pay attention but the reward is there, IMO.",1240667963

Then I got older and found I had a few favorite shows that I watched whether friends were watching them or not.<p>I then went through a phase where I felt TV was important for cultural intelligence -- knowing what's popular and what isn't. Sort of a cheap way to fit in with popular society without actually having to meet people.<p>Then I went through a History Channel/Science kick. I found you could watch all kinds of cool science-related stuff on cable almost ad-infinitum. Curious as to what the world would look like if people disappeared? Cable's got that. Want to know the role of tanks in WWI? Cable's got that too.<p>It was all kinds of stuff that <i>appeared</i> to have some science value. I could justify it by saying, ""Hey, I'm learning important facts about the migratory patterns of African Swallows here.""<p>For the last couple of years I've been in the ""I control the input"" stage. That is, I watch only things that I have planned to watch ahead of time and only on Tivo/DVD. I hardly ever watch ""unprotected"" TV -- just me and the remote.<p>Finally, because of this board, I've decided to cut out TV entirely except for movie-watching every other weekend or so. After a couple of months of doing this, I can attest that it is one of the better decisions I've made in my life -- assuming I can keep it up.<p>TV is just so much bullshit. All of those years, and all of those tens of thousands of hours, accomplished me exactly nothing. I'm not even sure they were relaxing as much as it was simply anesthetizing. TV watching for peer groups was great if you wanted to fit into peer groups that chatted about American Idol. Favorite shows became dated. Cable was just a big time suck -- like one of those bug zappers except for idle minds. Pop science is eye candy and over-generalizations. In fact, the conclusion I reached is that <i>TV is something where you will automatically find some kind of reason for watching whether it really provides value or not</i>. It was all just rationalization.<p>When I stopped watching TV I had an awful thought -- what would I do now? I was used to feeling just slightly bored and pushing a button and being entertained. I had been trained that feeling bored was somehow abnormal, instead of a natural impulse that makes people do new things.<p>If you spent ten thousand hours staring at a stump there would be something wrong with you. But you can take that same time and watch all the episodes of the popular shows for the last ten years and accomplish exactly the same thing: nothing. And by doing that somehow that makes you ""normal""",1240667886
578889,comment,571686,572028,0,0,Ardit20,,,"The article mentions that we should have equal opportunities, namely people with low cognitive abilities should be able to enhance them so they can compete with those people whose nature has given high cognitive abilities. Perhaps, if cognition is something completely hereditary and nurture plays a very small role, then sure allow them to have equal capacity, but as the story of Alex clearly shows this does not create equal opportunity but unfair advantage and competition. The guy is able to go out there drink and party and then do the paper in a short time and not really gain the greater knowledge from lecturers. So he is hacking education and focusing on only these papers and gets better grades, but surely he is not a better man for the job than the person who spend his time studying and attending lectures although short of time failed to finish all the essays to a high standard.<p>So I think they create unfair competition and advantage hence should be banned.",1240667783
578888,comment,578755,578884,0,0,bonaldi,,,"I refuse to make you a screenshot of gmail, so I'll just ask: what are the contents of all those messages? You don't know, because your client allows you to read a message a time. Gmail lets you read a conversation at a time. Massive difference.<p>[Edit since I'm now on a real keyboard]<p><i>I have no idea what you mean by ""treats conversations as units"". The same could be said for any threaded view I guess.</i><p>What I mean is that the atom of the mail client is an entire conversation. So when I move it to another folder (or label it in Gmail parlance) all the related messages get grouped, or flagged or whatever. You <i>can</i> do some operations at an individual message level so the metaphor's not overpoweringly intrusive, but for general day-to-day operation, the conversation is the unit you deal with.<p><i>Except that the threaded view also exposes the nesting, which is quite a bit more helpful on mailing lists than a flat view that jumps randomly between levels.</i><p>There's nothing about conversations that prevents this. Look at Hacker News: it has both all-posts-on-a-page <i>and</i> nesting. Would you prefer that the comments view was just a list of timestamps and poster names and you had to individually click each one to see the comment? No? Yet that's what most mailing list clients and archives make you do.<p><i>Yes, that's nice and fancy for 1:1 conversations.</i><p>... which are the primary use of email for millions of people. I'm not sure why you're so quick to condemn something that would be such a massive leap in usability for so many email users and that doesn't exclude your preferred method of operation.<p>I personally prefer to read mailing lists and usenet in thread-to-page, just as I prefer to see the contents of online comment threads and instant messages all in one screenful. You may not. But as you've said, virtually every half-decent mail client of the past 30 years can handle message-level threading.<p>But I want more. I actually wonder if the prevalence of mailing list-centric attitudes like yours among engineers is the reason we don't have mail clients with proper conversations yet. I actually suspect that it's still simply too hard: you have to sort and search potentially tens of thousands of messages just to display one conversation, and the easier route is just to make the human do the work. But I'd far rather my (or Google's) computer did it for me.",1240667343

578886,comment,578292,578423,0,0,briansmith,,,"Windows XP still supports 16-bit Windows 3.x applications. Sun's backward compatibility guarantee goes back to  SPARC7 (circa 1987) which was already 32-bit. Windows 3.0 was 16-bit and was released in 1990. I don't know about IBM but I imagine the situation is similar. Linus didn't even start Linux until 1991. Desktop Mac OS X was released in 2001. Microsoft's compatibility achievement there is much more impressive to me.<p>AFAICT, the primary reason for this compatibility mode is to run IE6 side-by-side with IE8, so that corporations don't have to upgrade their web apps all at once. Neither Linux nor Mac OS X offers that feature for <i>free</i>; you can virtualize XP in Linux and Mac OS X but you don't get a free XP license with them.",1240667227

578876,comment,578292,578349,0,0,briansmith,,,"Do you have a citation for ""Microsoft pressuring hardware makers not to offer XP drivers?"" I'm sure they are pressuring them into offering Vista/7 drivers but I'd be surprised if they were telling them to stop offering XP drivers.<p>People want maximum benefit for minimal investment. My friend just bought a 2005 Corolla instead of a 2009 Corolla. The 2009 model is much better, but it isn't 225% better to match its cost. It is the same thing with XP and Vista. There really are a lot of important benefits to upgrading to Vista from XP and from IE6 to IE8. But, people aren't convinced that it is worth the cost of upgrading. Especially now that Windows 7 is around the corner, <i>nobody</i> wants to roll out a new Vista deployment that is already obsolete. Instead, the companies that avoided upgrading are going to save a lot of money upgrading directly to IE8/Win7. And, they are probably not going to upgrade from IE8/Win7 for another 5-10 years.<p>By the way, the #1 reason for having this virtualized XP feature is to run IE6 inside of Windows 7. Some companies that didn't upgrade their internal web apps to with with IE7/IE8 are going to save a <i>lot</i> of money because of that.",1240666214

Everyone remembers the Navigator part of the case, but there was also the case of them preventing Hitachi from releasing machines with BeOS installed as the default operating system.  By the time Be was awarded damages, they had run out of cash and shut down.<p>So don't think it's because MS perceive the game as different; it's because they lost in the courts.

3474352,story,,,1,0,nutanc,"Show HN: KooKoo App Directory for voice services",,"KooKoo(http://www.kookoo.in) is a cloud telephony interface which provides an interface between the web world and the telephony world.  This is similar to Twilio in India.<p>Since we launched last year we have handled more than 200 million calls and have around 1500 registered developers.<p>A lot of developers are building voice services on our KooKoo platform. Most of them have a problem of discoverability. Also, we were talking to several telcos and though most of them provide short code VAS services, remembering the short codes is a pain. One other problem was that building location based voice services currently is tough.<p>So we were trying to think of some innovative way in which to solve these problems and we came up with the idea of building a simple android app which provides a clickable icon for all these services. Though the idea is simple, we hope that this solves some major problems.<p>So we went ahead and hacked up ""KooKoo Voice App Directory"", an android app.(https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ozonetel.kookooappexchange).<p>This app is specific to India as the services listed work in India. But the concepts in the app can certainly be used anywhere and maybe companies like Twilio can make use of the concepts to come up with their own voice-mobile apps showcasing all the apps built on the Twilio platform.<p>We will be open sourcing the android app next week.<p>Details:<p>KooKoo Voice App Directory at its heart is a contact directory app and it mainly tries to solve 3 problems.<p>1. Discovery: KooKoo has been a very popular platform for developers to build telephony applications. There are more than 1500 registered developers with a lot of innovative apps being built on the platform every day. This creates a problem of discoverability. Users do not know what services are available and also do not remember the phone numbers\nfor those services. The mobile application provides a generic solution for this problem. Install the KooKoo mobile app to access all voice services without remembering the phone numbers. The service list will be updated regularly. We believe this provides a solution to all service\nproviders also where there is a problem of finding and remembering the short codes of value added services.<p>2. Innovation: Voice services are limited by the fact that they do not get enough information about the caller. All we get to know is the caller id and there is very limited information that we can extract from that. But in a mobile app we can get much more information about the caller including their location(with their permission, of course). An example of this is the weather app in the KooKoo app exchange. When the user dials the weather app, we playback the current weather based on the user location. The data channel is not used at call. So location based services can be enabled for voice services. This innovative use opens up\nthe door for a whole host of location based voice services.<p>3. Monetization: Currently, all apps on the App exchange are free. But in the future we plan to enable paid apps as well. Developers can charge per minute credits to access their content. Users can buy pre paid credits from the KooKoo website and use the credits on the paid content apps.<p>If you are interested in having your app phone number listed here please send an email to support@kookoo.in",1326793645

She transferred me to him.  He picked up on the first ring.  I explained the situation briefly, we spoke for a few minutes, at the end of which he said he'd put me in touch with the guy who could fix things.  Fifteen minutes later I was talking with him, and we exchanged information over the next few months as I helped him plug his holes.  I am still highly impressed by the professionalism demonstrated at all levels.  I'd also worked with Microsoft to resolve a GPL compliance issue (again, directly contacting the appropriate VP) again with minimal fuss.<p>A southeastern US university IT contractor who's private business was spamming me (and he was denying it) ended up with a series of emails escalating up the academic food chain, ultimately to the university president (.edu websites are, or at least were, wonderfully information rich).  I eventually got the response I had hoped I'd get on first contact.<p>Another issue involving AOL at which numerous attempts to contact them failed. I ended up somewhat crashing (well, I <i>did</i> wrangle a late invite for a brief presentation) at which I presented data, including some which indicated AOL's little problem.  Their chief postmaster was present.  We talked a bit.<p>More recently, Yahoo have had issues in severely restricting mail delivery rates to Yahoo's MXs, even for long-existing, SPF/DKIM compliant MTAs.  I'd gone endless rounds with their helpdesk and had repeatedly emailed (with no response) their CTO.  So I sent a group email to a roster of their top (C-level and senior VP) staff, again with some data indicating issues (pflogsumm delivery stats showing hours of delay) and an introductory text ""Gentlemen, you have a problem"".  <i>That</i> finally got a response in the form of a ""Yahoo concierge"" who spoke with me a couple of times and sorted the problem (and also promised a review of policies in general, in case anyone else is having issues).<p>Just a few anecdotes of different ways to get a company's attention. There's no one-size-fits-all approach, so be flexible. I generally try a direct private contact first, but ... well, if that doesn't work, I've got a bag of tricks I can pull out.  Public shaming <i>can</i> work, but I'm willing to give the benefit of doubt first.",1326793411

Startups typically need to build web apps that are so customized that it doesn't make sense to use a CMS.  I found writing code at a lower level really helped me learn a lot more and captivated my interest.  No longer was I having to play by the maddening rules of the CMS.  Its more challenging but more rewarding and helps you learn whats really going on behind the surface.  I would roughly equate coding in drupal to using windows where they try to hide the 'insides' of the application from the developer.  You are learning more about the CMS's API and not the underlying processes. Using a lower level framework (rails, django, express) is more like unix where it is more transparent and easier to customize but demands some real understanding.  Or just not using a framework at all is nice but can burn a lot of time.  Everyone should build their own atleast once, but after that let the frameworks to the boring stuff and stick to coding the fun stuff.",1326792911

3474309,comment,3471726,3473119,7,0,MengYuanLong,,,"To begin, donations are not in exchange for a particular service or benefit. That is why these are donations and not membership fees. When you donate money to the Red Cross, you are not mandating that they provide fresh water to somebody in Thailand. Instead you are donating the money with the expectation that it is used in a way consistent with mission. So, Carr's claim that they are somehow ""making a mockery"" of those who donated money ""to keep wikipedia live"" fails to hold water. This argument is a strawman. They are upholding their mission to provide a knowledge repository by protecting their ability to do that. Again, donations are not membership fees and they are being used at the discretion of the organization.<p>Second, the neutrality argument is equally weak. This is even addressed in the official Wikipedia release. Providing an objective and balanced knowledge repository does not require that they as an organizations behave in a neutral manner. The Wikimedia Foundation clearly feels the passage of this bill into law would negatively affect their ability to serve the community. Thus, they are expressing their position against the bill. Is that not proper? How personal must the attack be before it is okay for Wikimedia to take a stand and ""lose their objectiveness"".<p>His final argument is extremely naive and simply not true. By his account, if you have a stance on a public topic and publicly declare it, you are now and forever inherently stating your approval of any subject you fail to discuss. If you think this is an exaggeration, here is his statement, ""The trouble with taking a political stance on one issue is that your silence on every issue becomes a stance...Everything else thats happened in the world until now, and everything that will ever happen from this day forward...""<p>By this logic, a group like the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation must be in support of the Rape of Nanjing. PETA must be completely okay with the fraud committed by Enron. I could certainly create an unending list but the point is clear. It is impossible and unnecessary to publicly (or privately for that matter) hold informed positions about every topic.<p>On a final note, I think it is actually very logical that different services should show support in different manners. Twitter, Facebook, G+, etc. are social networks and as such,  can make the most impact by members creating an echo chamber of dissent. Wikipedia on the other hand is a resource. And, just like the physical world, we feel the greatest impact of a resource when it is no longer available.",1326792126

If the proposal works out, future computer geeks will have a very different cognitive style.<p>Another approach might be to recast every problem as finding a solution in a search-space - and then have as many cores as you like trying out solutions. Ideally, a search-space enables some hill-climbing (i.e. if you hit on a good solution, there's a greater than average probability that other good solutions will be nearby), and for this, it is very helpful to know the result of previous searches and thus sequential computation is ideal. But, if the hills aren't that great as predictors, and if you do feed-in other results as they become available, the many-cores would easily overcome this inefficiency.<p>An appealing thing about a search-space approach is that it may lend itself to mathematically described problems, i.e.   declare the qualities that a solution must have, rather than  how to compute it.",1326791057

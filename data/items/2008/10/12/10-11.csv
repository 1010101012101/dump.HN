Resources are available, production is huge everywhere and rising, more and more people are entering the rich class, more and more countries are becoming industrialised, there are very few active wars right now.<p>We live in an unprecendented era of peace and prosperity, and this 'problem' we are observing is just a matter of numbers being pushed from one person to the other. But there is still value being produced, there is still demand for that value.<p>You should become afraid when you see people withdrawing their savings from the banks, and when a major hostile economic block comes up. What we're observing is just economic readjustment, it's not critical.<p>If in a year this situation still exists, I'll eat my hat on a webcam. You can hold me to that.",1223808957
330250,comment,330139,330139,0,0,Create,,,"DICTATORSHIPS are like a good many other things in this world. They can be the best, or the worst, form of government.\nThere are some excellent dictatorships, and there are some hateful ones. Nevertheless, be they good or bad, it generally happens that they are imposed by circumstances, and, when this is the case, the people concerned have no choice but to put up with them. Inasmuch as a nation cannot be too strongly urged not to drift into a situation which leaves it no alternative but helpless acquiescence, this brief and cursory survey of dictators as they have displayed themselves at successive stages of the world's history may not be without profit to the French people at this present juncture.<p>\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWE are constantly deluding ourselves with the notion that things are new, when, in truth, we are but repeating the experiences of former generations and treading the paths which they long since have trod. The dictatorships of our time came into being on the morrow of the day when President Wilson enjoined us to 'make the world safe for democracy. The victory of the Allies was universally hailed as a triumph for the democratic spirit in all its varied forms. Amid the din of falling thrones, three empires came crashing to the ground. The monarchical system, by which the control of the State is vested in one sole person, seemed doomed to extinction. Who would have dreamt that one-man rule would ever come into its own again? <i>When the first dictator came upon the scene, his advent was greeted with incredulity. A few days, men prophesied, would surely set a term to his dominion. In France, one politician went the length of publicly deriding him as a comic-opera Caesar</i>. And then, when the fashion seemed to be spreading, people consoled themselves with the belief that, if it was an epidemic, it would assuredly stop short at the frontiers of the Greater Powers, of those countries which had a liberal tradition at the back of them, and a firmly established progressive wing. <i>As for inflation and debased currencies, these things, though not unknown, were looked upon as evils proper to impoverished, primitive or ill-governed communities. It was not for a moment to be thought of that the wealthier nations, equipped as they were with a well-organized financial system, would fall a prey to such grave disorders. All this turned out to be a grievous miscalculation. The monetary system fell a victim to disease in the very places where it seemed to be flourishing most securely. Dictatorships sprang up in countries where they had long been looked upon as unimaginable</i>. There they took firm root, despite the fact that, for a long time, the dictators themselves, when still no more than popular sedition-mongers, had never been taken seriously. It is no mere caprice that has led us to connect a disordered currency with the emergence of despotic forms of government. The one precedes, and often begets, the other, because, for the vast majority of people, it is the most obvious symptom of national disintegration.\n(300 pages later)<p>\nCONCLUSION\nmeasure pfuncertainty. It is desirable to be sparing of Itfiem7 desirable, that is, not to have need of them, or not to drift into them unwittingly. Eckermann once asked Goethe if the human race would ever see the end of way “Yes” answered the sage of Weimar, provided that governments are always intelligent and the governed always reasonable. We will say the same of dictators. We can do without them on the same condition. But good governments are rare. And Voltaire said that the bulk of the human race always were, and always would be, imbeciles.\nps: a bonus from the same author:\n<a href=""http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/bainville_jacques/consequences_pol_paix/consequences_pol_paix.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/bainville_jacques/conse...</a><p>---\nThe real choice is liberty versus control.

330249,comment,329859,329948,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, I know you're asking more from an ""approach to business"" perspective than a ""how much Open Source goes on in the valley"" perspective...but, I figured I'd chime in, anyway:<p>I've been surprised by how little Open Source happens in the valley, at least among the ""young, rich and good looking"" startup set that shows up all the time on TC and Valleywag.  I'm somewhat disappointed by it, as well.  Folks are building everything they do on Free and Open Source Software.  It's polite to give something back, even if the license was written before web apps were a presence, and so you aren't legally obligated to do so.  I don't want that to sound <i>too</i> harsh or too inclusive.  There are tons of startups, in the valley and elsewhere, that <i>do</i> take part in Open Source development, but I'd say for every one that I meet at events, I meet five startup founders that have never contributed a line of code to Open Source, even though their apps are built with PHP, Ruby, Perl, or Python, using vast swaths of Open Source library code, are checked into git or Subversion, and run on top of Linux.  This could just be selection bias, since it seems like a lot of OSS folks are more likely to be bootstrapping outside of the valley.<p>Anyway, we're an Open Source project (Webmin/Virtualmin/Usermin) turned startup.  It has positives and negatives, but I don't think one can say, ""You can't be the next Google/Yahoo/Microsoft, if you're running a fun Open Source oriented company""...we don't know that yet.  It's still early in the history of OSS startups.  Red Hat does OK.  MySQL AB sold to Sun for ~$500 million, XenSource to Citrix for ~$300...Not Google/Yahoo/MS money, but nothing to sneeze at.  Making money on Open Source is harder than on proprietary software, in general.  But, you get some awesome benefits.  Like, how many of our competitors can claim <i>millions</i> of users?  Not a single one.  While our software has been downloaded over 12 million times from a single source (and OSS ends up in all sorts of funny places without showing up on the download counter, because it gets packaged, included with distros and hardware products, comes from local mirrors, etc.).  And, let's face it, when you have a million people looking at your software on a daily basis, you pretty much can't help but make money if you're trying.  Free is a powerful game changer in most markets, and changing the game might be mandatory if you're working in an established market against strong competitors.<p>From the perspective of raising money, investors don't have a problem with it, and most understand OSS.  It may even be a positive angle for them, assuming you still have a business model after factoring in, ""But it's free!""",1223808825

Viral videos are an exception - not every video uploaded on a video-sharing site is watched by millions.<p>We do value it but its more intimate and less noticeable than mass culture. Most stuff people create - jokes, sketches, songs, voiced opinions, puns, parodies, etc. etc. isn't shared. In fact this ""microculture"" is the basis of our social lives.<p>I think mass culture is both a result and a product of our social alienation.

Smart people want quality, but most people will settle for whatever's rammed down their throats.<p>As for me, I actually buy quite a lot of music that I really like, because I want it at maximum quality.<p>I'm not as innocent when it comes to movies. Sometimes I download them, but rarely go see them in theatres.<p>Sometimes I start watching a downloaded movie but stop because it's not good enough.<p>Sometimes, a downloaded movie happens to be really enjoyable, but will I go buy it after watching?<p>Nope..<p>The problem is that the re-use value of good music is pretty much infinite, but you'll rarely want to watch even a good movie again, so after seeing it, its value drops close to zero.",1223807457

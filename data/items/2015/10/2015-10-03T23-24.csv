10325897,comment,10324937,10325882,0,0,jakeva,,,"Well that&#x27;s a more nuanced philosophical discussion for which murder is a poor example. A better one would be something like stealing a candy bar from a grocery store. A found body, or a reported missing person, would yield a response from local law enforcement if the perpetrator could be linked in any way. An example of a stolen candy bar the grocer never noticed missing more directly targets the question of &#x27;if I don&#x27;t get caught, does it matter&#x27;?<p>Anyway, the question here isn&#x27;t whether you get caught. The question is whether it&#x27;s actually illegal if there is no copyright holder that anyone knows of, and one doesn&#x27;t come forward with a legitimate claim. Will law enforcement charge you with a crime?<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer and have no experience with law, but I do love free (and legally so) movies, so I&#x27;m genuinely curious about this.",1443916704

The latter is valued for its utility, but there&#x27;s always a possibility that mere workman&#x27;s duty will be exceeded, with the result carrying a sensibility well above its intended purpose.<p>I think that may be the case for this particular sketch artist.  The drawings seem to capture not only how individuals look, but also portray something of their emotional states, contrasts among them obvious, interesting and surprising.  The relational elements are echoed in the subtleties of spacing, angles and proportion, factors that begin to delineate &quot;art&quot; from the prosaic.<p>The article shows the artist to be quite a character himself.

Granted, usually you work with the logarithmic derivative which is a lot more tractable, but if for whatever reason you need the actual derivative, you&#x27;re gonna have a lot of trouble with automatic differentiation, as the typical analytic continuation formulas involve some complicated improper integrals.<p>There are also functions that you only know by sampling (e.g. ocean temperatures) for which you assume smoothness. You need to pick an interpolation method, but sometimes you do not interpolate beyond the sampling points, because that&#x27;s just making up numbers. When you&#x27;re limited by your original sampling step size, you have little recurse but to compute derivatives by some finite differencing scheme.",1443916054

I just recently came across &quot;Punched-Card Systems and the Early Information Explosion, 1880–1945&quot;, which is the generation <i>before</i> what I&#x27;m really interested in.

I&#x27;ve got an overview now, and am fleshing out the details.<p>That publication history includes many tellings or summarizing of the history. Of which quite a few are wrong in the details. For example, I yesterday read some papers from the early 1990s which said that the &quot;connection table&quot; (a graph theoretical model of a molecule) comes from the 1970s. When I can point to papers from the early 1960s which use the term, and people in the 1950s who were implementing the concept on a computer - the concept often comes before the name.<p>Which means most of the history I want to publish will be deathly boring to someone like you who isn&#x27;t in the field.

If you find you don&#x27;t like it, hey, you only spent $12.<p>I&#x27;ve used the FunCube Pro+ dongle for amateur radio stuff.  It&#x27;s very narrow-band (it&#x27;s based on a sound card as the ADC) but it does cover most of the important amateur radio bands (HF) which most SDRs you find on the Internet do not without additional hardware.  It also has special filters around the 2m and 70cm amateur bands, the filters on 2m are especially nice because strong FM radio stations tend to desense the cheap receivers here (RTL-SDR, HackRF IIRC).<p>At work we use the USRP (B200) for WiFi-related testing, requiring the ability to receive and transmit above 5GHz over 80MHz of bandwidth.  The RTL-SDR is not going to do that.  (Actually the B200 doesn&#x27;t quite cover 80MHz, but it&#x27;s good enough.)<p>For actual amateur radio work I use an Elecraft KX3 with the 2m module.  You can&#x27;t beat the sensitivity of an entire system engineered to be sensitive.  With off-the-shelf SDRs (the KX3 is SDR-based) there are going to be a lot of issues to debug to get the full system performing well.  Fortunately, most of the hard parts have to do with transmitting at higher powers, so you might not care if you just want to listen.<p>A few friends have tried either the BladeRF or HackRF (I don&#x27;t remember which) and find that it uses an IF near the FM broadcast band, and hence they couldn&#x27;t get it to work reliably in Manhattan where they live because the IF stages are desensed by the super-strong FM stations nearby.  Of course, debugging this is going to require already-working radios and test equipment (oscilloscope/spectrum analyzer).  So these cheaper SDRs are not off-the-shelf instantly-working solutions.  They&#x27;re more of another thing that&#x27;s helpful to have in your lab.  You probably don&#x27;t want to tie up your $10,000 FTDX9000MP to be a WSPR beacon, so you find a good-enough SDR instead and use that.<p>Finally, the good news is that most of the people writing software for the radio experimentation community know radio and not software, so there is plenty of room for improvement if you care to work on the software.",1443914950

You know that kiddy question where someone&#x27;s going &quot;But WHY do it that way?!&quot; That&#x27;s me. Not on the outside, granted - but it&#x27;s the same sort of impulse.<p>Of course, as you get older, you start to learn a lot of the &#x27;whys,&#x27; and some of them are sensible. The outstanding &#x27;whys&#x27; for your day to day life tend to get resolved to a level that allows you to function one way or another. More precisely, however, they&#x27;re sensible within a specific context defined by the knowledge and assumptions that the parties involved bring to the table and the limits of the requirements they have for their answers.<p>So I read, I watch visually interesting films, I listen to talks of people who have interesting thoughts, I learn arts crafts and trades outside of my own to a reasonably functional level - (not quite to the level of making an artistry out of them but to the level where you can perceive why that person&#x27;s good and you&#x27;re not and some of the things you&#x27;d need to do to approach them.) I try to have a wide context to compare the answers to those &#x27;why&#x27; questions to. Because what&#x27;s sensible in one context <i>isn&#x27;t</i> in another.<p>There are other skills involved. There are bits of knowledge that are general tools. For instance maths, formal logic - I&#x27;d be inclined to suggest a surprising amount of the study of workflows (not just in a user interface sense) is worth looking at because that&#x27;s often generally applicable to the why of things, etc.<p>I digress: The majority of the &#x27;why&#x27; questions have sensible answers. The world would not function acceptably otherwise. That&#x27;s fine from the perspective of intellectual exploration. If you&#x27;re wrong you get an answer that will let you ask more &#x27;why&#x27; questions, and if you&#x27;re right you get another answer - difficult to lose with those outcomes.<p>Every so often a &#x27;why&#x27; comes along where the answer doesn&#x27;t make sense in the context that you&#x27;ve got, and then you&#x27;ve got an idea that&#x27;s worth trying out. Seeing whether you can take the thing from that other context and put it in the context that seems wrong. Take one concept from one place and use it here instead. That just seems natural when it happens. Ideas seem like it&#x27;s the other people who&#x27;ve gone off into crazy land, or missed something. For me, it&#x27;s the same feeling from when I was little and the parents would go &#x27;BECAUSE! Now I&#x27;ve got to go to work!&#x27;<p>And if that idea comes to nothing, no biggy. There&#x27;ll be another idea along in a little bit.<p>---<p>I&#x27;d reiterate I&#x27;m speaking just for myself there. It&#x27;s a thing that seems to work for me, it may not be the optimal thing and it may not work that well or that way for others.",1443913969

decades, e.g., IBM&#x27;s VM with
the interactive CMS (Conversational
Monitor System).  
In what sense is the Microsoft
CIL/CLR a <i>virtual machine</i>?
E.g., does it have any
security properties, e.g.,
restrictions via some
attribute control lists?<p>The CLI is a <i>virtual machine</i>
only in the sense that 
the <i>byte codes</i> are not
actual machine instructions
for any real processor core
but are just some <i>intermediate</i>
code <i>instructions</i> 
for an <i>imaginary</i> machine
that does not really exist
and, in that sense, is <i>virtual</i>?<p>So, on Windows,
say 7, 8.1, 10, Windows Server
of some year, etc., suppose
I take a file A.VB I&#x27;ve
typed in with Visual Basic .NET
source code, give that file A.VB to the
.NET program
VBC.EXE, which is in the collection
of .NET files, and get out from
running VBC.EXE
file A.EXE.  Now A.EXE has
<i>CIL byte code</i>?<p>Why <i>byte</i> code?  Or, in
what sense can each <i>code</i>
be only one <i>byte</i> long?<p>Does this <i>byte code</i>
mean that it would be
the same for running on 32
bit Intel x86 processors,
64 bit Intel processors,
ARM processors, etc.?<p>The CLR part is mostly 
<i>run time</i>, that is,
code my program A.VB
and A.EXE needs to run,
that is, in old terms,
a <i>library</i> to be
<i>linked in</i> via a
<i>linkage editor</i>?
Then with .NET on Windows,
the JIT work also plays
the role of a linkage editor?<p>One old trick was, don&#x27;t even
bring in the code to be <i>linked</i>
and, really, don&#x27;t even <i>link</i> to
that code and, instead, as the
program runs and such code
gets called, that is, an
attempt is made to use it,
in case that happens (which
maybe often it won&#x27;t),
there is a software <i>fault,
interrupt</i>, or some such
and the JIT code, still 
in Windows and still
available to run,
only then, after the <i>interrupt</i>,
actually gets and links the code
that is needed but so far
was missing?<p>Another old trick was,
really, never bring that
<i>library</i> code in the user&#x27;s 
program, do <i>link</i> to it,
but have the code it
part of the user&#x27;s address
space that is shared with
all the user address spaces
or even in another security
<i>ring</i> -- maybe Microsoft
is also doing some such trick?
I just outlined the Windows
<i>Global Cache</i>, e.g., mostly
from DLLs instead of EXEs?<p>Okay, I can see the point, as 
in the OP, of
the effort for <i>native</i>.  Indeed,
I&#x27;ve suspected that on Windows
frequently used programs
are kept in a <i>cache</i> somewhere
and, likely, ready to
read into an address space
or part of a <i>process</i>
as fast as possible, maybe
even with the usual 
address <i>relocation</i>
work already done.  So,
this looks like an
<i>under the covers</i> version
of <i>native</i> for Windows?<p>Ah, I just looked up Microsoft&#x27;s
<i>ngen</i>, and maybe what I just
described was ngen?<p>I&#x27;ve seen no very clear documentation
of these issues.  I&#x27;ve been
guessing at what happens, and that&#x27;s
not so good.<p>Thanks for the tutorial.",1443913266

1227524,comment,1226409,1226880,0,0,cia_plant,,,"I got into MIT by doing very well at math competitions, mostly. I also wrote a good application essay, which followed a certain kind of idea which is admired at MIT - the ideal of the ""passionate"" young person, who is a sort of intellectual go-getter. This doesn't actually reflect my personality, but at the time I was somewhat dazzled by the MIT mythology, and I'm pretty good at writing in character.<p>By the end of my time at MIT, I'd moved towards a fairly radical point of view about education, and about many other institutions in society. I think that the established structures of society - educational, scientific, political, or economic - tend to be highly conservative, in the sense that they defend a conventional view of what is 'scientific' or 'educational' and so on. In this way they devalue diversity.<p>I personally don't think it is possible to develop the awesome potential of the human mind by following a 'program' of any sort. The defining characteristic of the mind is its ability to adapt, and to incorporate new ideas and new points of view into a more thorough conception of reality. This implies that one will progress most by constantly challenging what one has previously believed. But this kind of path can not be planned out in advance: at most one can try to have as wide a base of experience as possible, and to resist the urge to dismiss the 'outlandish' too quickly.<p>In short, I think the primary characteristic of curricular education is its conservative opposition to diversity; while the most basic ingredient in intellectual progress is exactly that diversity. This view was reflected in my time at MIT - MIT has a rather strong curricular structure, and I found it frustrating in the extreme (I was frequently depressed while at MIT). For example, MIT teaches analytic philosophy, neoclassical economics, rational-choice political science: these are all echoes of the same narrow, scientistic outlook. Continental philosophy and heterodox economics follow a more tentative, experimental approach to knowledge, but they would fit poorly with MIT culture.<p>As for whether it is a good thing for a young person to go to MIT, I suppose that depends on your view of a good life. If a good life is doing well at one boring, pointless task in order to be given a still more boring, more pointless task, then MIT is an excellent choice. An MIT education is genuinely rigorous (more-so than Harvard), and an MIT graduate can move onto graduate studies with confidence. From there, who knows? You may even win a Nobel Prize.<p>If you want to achieve intellectual excellence, in a traditional human sense that would be understood by the ancient Greeks, I would look elsewhere. I get the sense that continental Europe is less fully colonized by one-dimensional thinking, although I can't entirely confirm this.",1269895951

But by and large the aid workers are genuine - heck, they are the only people who seem to perceive the homeless as <i>people</i>.<p>So the question is, who are these aid workers working for - if they represent the city directly, then yeah, I'd be inclined to call shenanigans. If they represent an apolitical aid organization though, I'd be hesitant to make that accusation.<p>Part of the complexity of the situation is that a lot of the homeless have severe mental illnesses, and many are dangers to themselves because of it. This is why I don't immediately jump to the ""enforcer"" conclusion - it may very well be that the social workers are trying to get him to a place where his mental illness may be treated.<p>Personally I'm against efforts by cities to simply get the homeless out of sight - I think most people in society sorely need a daily reminder of just how lucky they are, and how much they are not doing to lift up those around them. Let the ugliness and ills of the city shine openly, it's the only way we will ever be compelled to fix them.",1269895783

You still have a bug.<p>No type check can check runtime dependent data. You pass in a List but the list requires to be at least of length 2? (Actually you some languages can tackle this too, but these sort of requirements become arbitrary complex.) You will deref the list out of bounds and you have a bug.<p>So now I just sketched two scenario's where you still need to actually run your program to catch bugs. And your type system did  nothing.<p>A very certain kind of bug -- mostly typo's or slightly higher level mistake -- are caught by a static type systems. The question is, is this worth the restricted semantics of the language?<p>The advantage of a static type system is clear; these mistakes are caught where and when they are introduced, not where their result is used.<p>The disadvantage is also clear: restricted semantics. How would macro's look for lisp if it had type checks?<p>Without types, your language is better at creating macro-like abstractions. You can capture patterns with these, and prevent a lot of typos that way. (And a write a lot more concise code.)<p>And even more, think about Java's performance hit on ArrayStoreException ...

1227417,comment,1227050,1227319,0,0,jonnytran,,,"I think a better question would be, do any languages have features that help _you_ follow an aspect-oriented paradigm?  At the end of the day, you can use just about any paradigm in Java.  By no means does it enforce OO.  Ditto for just about any other language.  But certain features make it easy to use OO, so when using it, you feel compelled to use that paradigm.<p>Do any languages make it easy?  Ruby, for example, allows it.  But it feels like it was never intended.

Having read all his nonfiction and his autobiography over the past three years, I must warn against starting with either of these, two of his most difficult, novels.<p>You see, Nabokov toys with his readers - he leaves puzzles throughout his books; he writes in defiance of literary criticism (part of his impetus in Pale Fire); he foreshadows with a trail of anagrams.  To throw someone in media res of two of his most complex tales (perhaps only surpassed by Lolita and The Gift), might give a premature distaste for Nabokov's heady style.<p>What I would personally recommend for someone new to Nabokov would be any of Despair, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, or Transparent Things.<p>If you like Nabokov, you may also want to try:<p>Rushdie, Salman - The Satanic Verses<p>Pynchon, Thomas - The Crying of Lot 49",1269893050

(Dollars/Person within 20 feet), or is it unnormalized and we could just be looking at a situation where more people came later.  How long were the time periods of each trial?  How much better did he do at each trial, in terms of percentages?<p>Also, since he apparently has the data, I'm dieing to know how much one of these guys does make per day.",1269893032

It seems that a system which has been in use since 1979 somehow got confused by the sensory data.

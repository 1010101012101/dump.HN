In my opinion as a foreigner, the USA fails at pre-university, scores ok at undergrad level, and excels amazingly at grad level and afterwards.<p>The USA imports people all the time, including thousands of graduates. Like you and me. Very few countries do it at a comparable scale; perhaps only the UK and Switzerland.",1218901617

Within five years, I think the true web operating system will be born; and it's not like YouOS or any of those other pseudo operating systems in browsers. Why do you need contextual menus and a proprietary file system inside a browser? That's what the desktop operating system is for.<p>The internet operating system is going to be driven by these richly interactive and dynamic web applications built on top of Javascript in a web browser. Finally, it seems people are starting to realize that there's no reason for the user interaction and interface gap between desktop and web applications.<p>Sadly, even though the internet is relatively young, the interface paradigms of how web apps are supposed to be built have already been engrained in the minds of web developers. Still, I hope someday there will little difference between a Cocoa app and a Web app. MobileMe and 280Slides are just the first batch of these.",1218899958

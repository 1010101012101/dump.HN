Make it open-ended, and make it pose an interesting question (literally or not literally). Controversy helps, but if you're too mercenary in courting controversy, people will quickly tire of your shtick.<p>Think of content-comment flow like a conversation. If I'm interviewing someone, and all I'm doing is making declarative statements to him, how likely is he to respond deeply and meaningfully? On the other hand, if I ask him interesting questions, I'll get interesting replies. Also, much like in an actual interview, I'll need to ask follow-up questions. When I look at most content sites out there these days, I see little in the way of back-and-forth exchange between the author and the commenters -- except in the form of moderation. Sooner or later, smart content authors are going to realize that their involvement does not end at the posting of the original piece.<p>Of course, you need to inform just as much as you open up the floor.

What a terrible way to invest your money.  You could have been taking that extra money you were paying in principle payments for years and investing it in conservative investments and making 6-7%.  Instead you've wasted it on a depreciating asset that only requires repairs, costs taxes every year, and isn't likely to appreciate in value for the next 3-4 years.<p>Take all of the extra principle payments you have made - calculate what they would have made at a 5, 6, or 7% interest rate.

2548767,comment,2548410,2548485,10,0,Peaker,,,"The more advanced of a type system you have, the more you can optimize indeed.  A nice example of this is the zip function.<p>In Haskell:<p><pre><code>    zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
    zip [] _ = []
    zip _ [] = []
    zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zip xs ys
</code></pre>
Note how each iteration needs to check both lists for emptiness.<p>In a more advanced type system (or using more advanced type hackery in Haskell) you can have length-indexed lists. That is: lists that have 2 type parameters or ""indexes"" instead of 1. The 1 is usually the type of element inside the list, the extra 1 is a natural number indicating the length of the list.<p>So the function zip becomes something like:<p><pre><code>    zip :: List N a -> List N b -> List N (a, b)
    zip [] [] = []
    zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zip xs ys
</code></pre>
The compiler checks the code and verifies, at compile-time, that both the input lists and the resulting list are all of the same length.  This also means that you only need one runtime emptiness check instead of 2. If the N is concretely known at compile-time, you may need 0 (though that case might be caught by inlining/loop unrolling optimizations anyway).",1305413487

That's why if you needed major surgery, you'd go to a reputable hospital and not to some clinic above a grocery store.<p>The hospital in this case is a middle man, and their role is vouching for the doctors they hire. When you buy a propane tank at Home Depot, the reason it doesn't blow up is that Home Depot's reputation depends on selling non-explodey propane tanks. When you buy meat at Whole Foods, why are you sure it's not rotten? Because the government checked that specific steak, or because you know Whole Foods wouldn't sell you rotten meat? Similarly, the reason people go to reputable hospitals is precisely because they know they can trust those places to hire competent staff.",1305413441

2548764,comment,2547707,2547707,2,0,edanm,,,"Interesting article. One major problem - it doesn't seem like the OP has ever actually <i>used</i> C for real world code. I say this as someone with a few years of experience with C (and a few years of C++).<p><i>None</i> of the examples he showed of C code look like they were actually written by a C programmer. A lot of use of ""goto""'s, for one thing. It looks like he tried reimplementing C++ in C.<p>Actually, that's exactly what he decided <i>must</i> be done: "" If the C version wishes to match the C++ version in speed and memory usage, it will have to basically simulate the C++ implementation using a struct and functions which handle objects of that struct type (including things like initialization and destruction).""<p>So obviously, if you set out from the start with the assumption that to use a language, you have to reimplement another language in it, then of course you'll come to the conclusion that you should just use the other language. But that's <i>not</i> a conclusion that C programmers would be comfortable with.<p>By the way, as just one nitpick, I'd probably implement that Matrix with ""void *"" pointers, letting me substitute any struct I want in there later. Just my way of solving the ""impossible to solve"" problem he presents at the end.",1305413409

Indeed, it seems that many people take class size as a proxy for the quality. But it's false.<p>If you go looking for actual data on the relationship between size and educational achievement, you'll find that it's pretty inconclusive. Nobody has been able to show a strong correlation linking smaller classes with better learning. The one exception is a study showing that in the specific population of ""at-risk kids"" (meaning, those who are probably not getting educational support at home), having smaller classes does help. But for the mainstream, nobody has been able to prove that investing in more teachers to shrink the size of classes has any positive impact.<p>Continuing to harp on class size is part of the problem.

Anyone that is smart enough not to buy and just wants to rent and invest their hard earned money elsewhere.  In my affluent neighborhood I can rent a house for $2,000 a month that would cost $4,000 a month to pay a mortgage on, not counting maintenance, repairs, and upkeep.  I could take that extra $2,000 a month and invest it in conservative financial instruments and make at least 6-7% return.  Or I could be paying a $4,000 mortgage with only about $500 of that going towards equity and having to pay an additional $10,000 annually of maintenance and upkeep (generally considered to be 1.5% of total house price per year).<p>Which one would you do?  The reason why _some_ people make money from housing is leverage.  You take out a huge loan and if it goes up in value a few %, you made much more than your starting value.  Leverage works exactly the same way when prices are declining.  Your small $50,000 downpayment is quickly erased by a 5% decline in value.<p>I don't like leverage in my investments.  I prefer to know that I can't lose more money than I invested in the first place.  I diversify my risk so that I can never lose more than 10-25% of what I own with a single investment.  Why would I put so much money in a single asset that is extremely illiquid and has so much leverage that I can lose more than my net worth?<p>Housing just doesn't make sense until the market returns to reality - and with federal subsidies including tax credits, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it won't return to a fair market until _all_ government subsidies are removed, including mortgage interest tax credits, Fannie/Freddy backing mortgages, etc.",1305412718

2548703,comment,2546269,2546665,3,0,MaxGabriel,,,"Well, the author does have a balanced point of view, but there are a couple explanations for why Whitaker would offer a more reserved view sometimes. First, critics of psychiatry get easily lumped into the 'anti-psychiatry' group where all drugs are bad, which is not where Whitaker wants to be. He knows empirically that this has weakened the effectiveness of critics (like those who get lumped in with scientologists). Moreover, he's just a really SMART person it seems to me. He is more concerned with the truth than an agenda, unlike probably other critics like Peter Breggin, who seem to manipulate much of the evidence.<p>Also, that Finland program as described in <i>Anatomy</i> uses very few psychiatric drugs, and it does in low doses and tries to keep people off them. Whitaker is just explaining that his opposition is not to 'psychiatric drugs' like some groups, but to unscientific & harmful practices, which is exactly what gives him so much ethos. The Finland program is from what I remember of it, far from modern psychiatric practices.<p>In fact, in my email communication with Whitaker, he has stated that no patients would miss antipsychotics if they were banned. Based on his books and many interviews/videos I have seen of Whitaker, I think he would probably agree with the statement ""The way most drugs are prescribed, they make the illness worse in the long-run."" (note I don't know Whitaker personally)<p>This is a very complicated debate because one can't talk about psychiatric drugs in general, you have to look at the individual evidence for each one. For example, I have much less faith in the Harrow Study that Whitaker cites as evidence that antipsychotics do worse, because I found the critique that its just the worst patients who stay on antipsychotics very salient. This study indicated the health of the off-med and on-med groups diverged after two years (with the off-med group improving <i>significantly.</i>) However, there seem to be a dearth of studies that are this long testing antipsychotics versus placebo (because of the inherent difficulty of that study, I imagine).",1305411813

You actually have a decent store of content about your topic, but right now it's practically invisible to search engines (for example, you refer to it as ""CF"", and you're not implementing good page title tags, or effective headers, urls, etc.). As I said, that can be fixed. The bigger problem is that Google's keyword tool for ""cystic fibrosis"" (exact match phrasing) shows not many are searching for what you're offering.<p>The general term ""cystic fibrosis"" has decent numbers, but that can include everything from people checking what it is to students doing reports on it. You are interested in people looking for treatment for it, and those numbers are very, very low. Perhaps people don't think to look for a treatment for it. Whatever the case, you would need to be near the #1 result for the keyword ""cystic fibrosis treatment"", beating out sites like mayoclinic.com and nlm.nih.gov, and you still wouldn't have more than a few thousand clicks per month.

Like almost every other CS class at Berkeley, it's not a language course; it's a computer science course.<p>A major part of the class was writing a Scheme interpreter in Scheme, which I imagine will not be possible in the new 61a (writing a Python interpreter in Python, that is). Considering how utterly jacked up Python's syntax is, compared to Scheme, I can't wait to see how they manage to pull this one off.<p>Really, if any Berkeley CS student can't learn Python on their own, their job prospects should be nil anyway.",1305410508

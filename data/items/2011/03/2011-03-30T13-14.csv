Maybe down the road I could parlay the experience into a programming job, or build something to make a living on. I know there are a lot of bridges to cross before then. But first I have 2 projects that I want to learn how to build from scratch and launch successfully. One would be just another Google bookmarks-like web service (scratch my own itch) and another is basically a lost-and-found database, but with a bit of a twist. Right now I just want to do them as accomplishments and then reassess on where it will go from there.<p>Brief thoughts on each of the three:<p>1. PHP - It is common so there are lots of resources and lots of jobs. Also it seems like I know more people using it and that translates into it being easier to get help.<p>2. Ruby (RoR) - It is good and works very well like the others but honestly part of why I want to use Ruby and learn Rails is because it is so hot and trendy and cool and I am a victim of marketing.<p>3. Python - Marco Arment (of Instapaper) made a statement in an interview that I understood to say he uses PHP because it just works and he knows it inside and out but if he was going to start over he would use Python.<p>One factor in consideration would be which of the 3 languages makes you the most ""hireable"" in the North East US, even though I am not sure I would ever even get to that level.<p>I'd also love to hear from anyone who uses one of the three above but wishes they had chosen and become proficient in one of the other two instead.<p>Finally, does it really matter that much?

That doesn't really seem to be the case any more.  There's a lot of stuff coming up on the Front Page now that I, personally, think is not valuable at all.  It's not spam, so I feel disinclined to flag it, but I can't downvote it either.  I think there are a lot of older hands who are starting to despair that so much trivial material makes it to the Front Page, and there seems to be no way of stopping it.<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the community has been diluted in its intent, purpose and interest.  Often the new people have insightful and interesting things to say, but the focus is largely gone <i>as compared to what attracted people in the first place.</i><p>One can no longer assume that just because an item has a high score, it must be of value.

Also, real banks have men with guns (not to mention the capability to summon heavily-armed police officers on very short notice) to protect them. Neither your computer nor your bitcoin bank is 1] stored in a vault or 2] protected by armed guards.<p>With that said, if you want anonymity, you don't use a bitcoin bank. Which means you store ALL your money on your computer, probably. Who carries ALL their money in their wallet? No-one.<p>ATM cards have various protections built into them, pin number, fraud protection, withdrawal limit, the fact that people keep them on their person and know to protect them, etc.<p>You can't steal an ATM card from 200 feet away without someone knowing about it.<p>It's also relatively hard to pickpocket people. You have to be right next to them.<p>The first bitcoin-stealing virus is going to be downright hilarious. (What's your physical analogy there? Someone could build a network of tiny robots and have them covertly steal cash from banks? It's theoretically possible.)",1301492722

Yes it is evident that brilliant people worked together and made something brilliant. Then you go on to say if you have no friends or family use the social web/world.

Its an easy way to get into a co-founder battle or have different interests that you only discover 2 months later. All those successful partnerships named early on are people who knew each other better than they knew themselves or just worked really well together. Going out and just networking isn't going to get you such a relationship. What you need to do is form a deep relationship and constantly shoot the shit and work on projects together, that way you can determine weather you work well or not (schools and living together are all things you can do this at, and is also common among all the successful partnerships mentioned above).",1301491774

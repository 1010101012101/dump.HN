3222084,comment,3221166,3221757,5,0,hugh3,,,"Reading the actual paper now. Important bits:<p><i>The composition of excreted normal human urine, is:4 urea 618 g day1, uric acid 1.8 g day1, creatinine 0.50.8 g day1, amino acids 0.12 g day1 and peptides 0.5 g day1. Variable amounts of lactic acid, citric acid, bilirubin and porphyrins, ketone bodies (aceto-acetic acid; -hydroxybutyrate; acetone), and small amounts of hexose (glucose) and pentose (arabinose) sugars may also be present in normal urine. When considering the bio-available organic content of excreted urine, compounds such as urea and uric acid are not included, since they cannot be utilised as carbon-energy (C/E) sources by the microbial community inside an MFC. In total, the dry weight content of metabolisable organic substrates, within excreted urine, was estimated to be 0.78 g/human/day.4 Due to the insignificant amount of lipid in urine, this has also been ignored. Therefore, the mean calorific value of 1 g of carbohydrates, peptides, proteins or amino-acids (as metabolisable substrates within urine) has been estimated to be 2.08 kcal</i><p>Which, if I'm reading it correctly, means you can extract 1.62 kCal of energy per day from your urine (assuming 100% efficiency).<p>This is not a lot. Even if you collected all the urine from a city of one million people, it would be roughly 80 kilowatts.",1320962319

There's also a whole cultural phenomena in large cities where people crammed together respect space by avoiding eye contact with one another. (Which, oddly, many Midwesterners tend to see as cold and aloof, but it's a built-in mechanism of cities).<p>Boyle traversed to needless gossip when he probably would have been better served to mind his own business, which is particularly annoying from him because he works with journalists as a ""newsroom web developer"" and presumably could be considered a journalist himself. He works at the Globe, and removed this fact from his twitter profile as people started questioning the ethics of the ordeal. I assume he was distancing his personal twitter from his professional life, but journalists don't normally get that kind of work/life balance from their employers.<p>I think the point of the Bourdain reference is that Bourdain's in the public eye as a celebrity, while this couple was not.

The old top distro is going to be over thrown by another until something better or more useful comes along. Honestly, with the commercial aspect to Ubuntu I never thought so many of the die hard Linux users would use it to begin with. I figured we'd see those people kicking and screaming to their graves before they used it. But a few of those people did switch and now they're switching to something else because Ubuntu has taken a turn for the worse (in their opinion).<p>We'll see how it plays out in the long run, but I think the simple fact that we're seeing so many stories on it here is only fueling the fire.

It's funny that two fairly naive young people in a Burger King are deciding the fate of their marriage, in that it's so absurd. I do think there is humor there.<p>But something was off-putting about how faithfully the guy was trying to document this event. It seemed like he was really trying to put these two people's identity on blast, and foiled only by the circumstances (the quality of his phone's camera, the distance between himself and the couple) rather than, you know, any sense of propriety or mercy.<p>I guess what I'm saying is, the element of identity changes the stakes. Like I said, the notion of two people ending their marriage in a Burger King is so ridiculous that it's funny. But when it becomes John Smith of 123 Main Street, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, having a fight with his wife Jane, it starts to feel weirdly mercenary. Like it's not being done for a laugh anymore, but expressly to humiliate two people.<p>But, I agree that this is the way things are going whether we all like it or not.

That was partly because I could see people's MySpace pages (not that I frequently wanted to) without having an account, unlike Facebook.<p>Yes, the technical elite from MySpace eventually moved to FB, but more importantly, FB got a ton of users that were never on MS. I don't think Google can do the same to FB, because there just aren't that many people that aren't on FB. They have to actively court current FB users.

Those laying the problem solely at the feet of the DBA's are missing the other group that tends to make these queries necessary: App Developers.  I once had an app developer tell me one type of invoice was impossible to make because some of the relationships and data were intrinsic to the application and would need to be modeled the same as the application.  He wasn't far off.<p>There is a point between transactional and data warehousing that needs to be hit.

Money quote:<p><i>At Zynga, however, Mark Pincus apparently likes to do things a bit differently. Rather than simply firing under-performing employees and handing unvested options over to the replacement, Pincus often likes to find another position within Zynga where the employee might still be able to contribute. But because that new position was often lower down the corporate totem poll, Pincus basically wanted to cut the person's compensation by reducing his or her number of unvested options (vested options were not touched).</i>",1320959158

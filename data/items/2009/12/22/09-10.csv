1009664,comment,1009661,1009661,0,0,quant18,,,"Though I criticise Google's NLP efforts a lot, actually I think this guy is too hard on it --- the word segmentation is pretty good. Most of the errors are in the romanisations.<p>Which makes sense when you consider what Google does. Word segmentation is a pretty essential part of dealing with Japanese search, so of course they've been working on that problem for years. (And probably a lot of their training data comes from search queries, consisting of long strings of kanji nouns, rather than verb phrases --- people search for nouns a lot more. Which is why they can correctly segment a godawful strings of kanji like ""会社役員高橋延拓容疑者"" or ""二重橋前交差点"", but choke on incredibly common verb conjugations like ""した"" or ""していた"").<p>On the other hand, they probably haven't been working on the romanisation problem that long --- it's useful at the margins of search (some terms might get written in hiragana rather than kanji either in queries or on pages), but not essential. I'd imagine they started just recently, as a result of their voice recognition/text-to-speech efforts.",1261474257

1009653,comment,1009600,1009600,0,0,fleitz,,,"Hadoop is designed as a batch processing framework not a real-time analysis framework. If your analysis functions are idempotent with regard to future data in the time domain simply compute summaries for each ""block"" down to the resolution supported for that age of data such that your summaries fit in memory. Save ALL the data to hadoop in case you need to replay it later. The answer to your question depends very much on whether you can summarize your data in the time domain. eg. if computing an average store block summaries as the average AND the number of items so that future summaries can be easily integrated. There is no one answer that will solve any possible analysis function, you'll need to optimize your system around the analysis function you want to perform and perhaps have a few different systems purpose built for different types of analysis.",1261473433

1009648,comment,1009137,1009308,0,0,tmd,,,"This is so far my favorite feature of the English language. Formal forms in the grammar are a relict of feudal type of thinking and in modern times they are not only redundant but also harmful. Need to choose between formal 'you' and informal 'you' leads to lots of awkward social situations. If you apply informal 'you' to someone older and who you don't know well it is usually a conversation breaker. If you use formal 'you' when speaking with a coeval it may look like you're patronizing him. Women sometimes get offended because they think you consider them older than they really are, and so on.<p>Also, when you start addressing someone using formal forms it is very hard to switch to informal 'you'. Using these forms affect human thinking and after you have already addressed someone formally (because it was in a professional situation for instance) you are not likely to become friends. In some cultures there is a special complex social protocol for switching from formal 'you' to informal one. This ceremony is sometimes called using a German word 'Bruderschaft' and for some peculiar reason it often involves kissing and drinking alcohol. This, rather unfortunate, photo captures such situation: <a href=""http://imgur.com/pmf57.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/pmf57.jpg</a><p>As I find it significantly easier to develop social relationships in English, I often wonder whether this lack of formal 'you' contributes to the economical prosperity of the English-speaking countries (and esp. the even less formal US).",1261473238

For example, they may make certain assumptions about the life their children would be able to lead in connection with - but not exclusively because of - property they may come to possess.<p>Edit: In addition to possibly removing an incentive, it may even go so far as to create an explicitly negative _disincentive_ for many people--people who believe the government is least morally entitled and least competent to dispose of their money.  Like it or not, many people who possess the ability and the inclination to accumulate wealth for themselves through the transaction of commerce of some description feel this way about the government, precisely because the government supports those who lack that ability or desire.  Wealthy people feel that that choice is for others to make for themselves (or, if the choice is truly not theirs, gain or suffer from as a consequence of certain natural and inexorable variations in the content of people's lives and the limitations of their abilities and intelligence), but not one that should have repercussions for them and the choices _they_ have made.",1261473222

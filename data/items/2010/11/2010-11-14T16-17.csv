Why do we insist on building on our broken immigration policy?<p>We need to make immigration simple for all immigrants. We don't need to create more laws that require an immigrant to spent $100K in legal fees to some lawyer to fill out paperwork.<p>I think YCombinator has proven that a startup doesn't need tons of funding to get an idea going.<p>The biggest problem with government is they over complicate EVERYTHING! We need simple solutions to the problems, not another stack of laws to add to the (literal) truck load that already exists.<p>We need one (1) page form that someone can fill out to get a visa. If someone comes from Mexico (for example), they should be able to fill out this form and get a Visa the same day. If someone flies in from Germany they too should be able to fill out this one page form and get a visa right at the airport. There is no reason why someone should have to have $100K in funding for a business, another $100K for legal fees just to get in.<p>I think the approach should be applied to everything government does. Simplify, Reduce, Eliminate.<p>Another good example is paperwork to start a business. I should be able to fill out a simple form and be able to have a business up and running (Legally) in any city/state in the US - the same day I fill out the form. I don't understand why places like New York City make these kinds of things so difficult. It takes MONTHS to get a business LEGALLY up and running in a major city like New York, but that same business can be LEGALLY up and running in 1 day in Hong Kong.",1289753803

This reply will address the topic of academic style and will consider several ways to approach it, while maintaining a focus on the conciseness generally preferred in this medium.<p>In order to discuss this fully, it is first necessary to define the terms. The word 'Academia' may have a wide range of interpretations and it is important to distinguish in which sense we are discussing it. For this discussion, we shall take it to mean formal study at graduate level or beyond.<p>As can be seen from the introduction, it is this author's belief that an academic reply should begin with a short preliminary sentence framing the topic in general, followed by a brief discussion of what the essay will contain.<p>Following this, the discourse should flow from point to point, with joining phrases such as ""following this"" to link paragraphs. Generally, points should be kept short, building on each other in small increments.<p>In this way, an academic writer can slowly expose the reader to their argument, without having their submission feel too heavy going.<p>Notice also that the previous paragraph was essentially filler, merely recapping the previous points, and drawing out a conclusion for the reader. By spelling out the conclusions throughout the text, the reader has to concentrate less, and will take on board the argument more easily.<p>To conclude, writing academically is a combination of concise points repeated in different ways for effect, statements of the conclusions throughout the essay in order to make the reader comfortable, and several other tactics, not least of which is the repetition of phrases from the title such as ""academic writing"" to remind the marker that you're answering the question. Finally, you can leave the essay on a slight tangent to 'wrap up', for example: It is this author's wish that this work may have contributed in some small way to the worthy goal of improving academic writing.",1289752368

A graphic designer can make most any site <i>look</i> nicer, but that doesn't mean the same thing as providing them with a better usage experience. For example, does the position/availability of search boxes make sense.<p>I'm not trying to argue, either. This is an interesting topic for me. Where the purely technical/engineering world merges with the artistic world there is often interesting overlap. Is it better to have form over function, or function over form? I think the answer is that it depends case by case on the desired result, and both areas often compromise to accommodate the other. So, for example, ""concept cars"" usually have exotic form, and look great, but they are usually hypothetical only because in reality they wouldn't be that great functionally -- they're usually purely artistic.",1289750842

What would be an acceptable model for these feedback loops?

How do we know that? Or, more precisely, what is the probability ratio that we assign that node in the decision tree? Y, right. Now if Y is not 1, then we do not KNOW that the budget will be balanced at date W. My point is, when modeling economic feedback loops 'Y' is rarely 1.<p>So I think what they are saying is, given the serious nature of the current economic shortfalls, they will confine the discussion to only those cuts whose savings can be assigned a probability ratio of 1 in the decision tree.

Why not let him immigrate to the US, and run his business (and pay his taxes) there?</i><p>Somewhat off topic (bear with me, I do have a point at the end), but he already does pay taxes in the US:
<a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2007/04/15/taxes-dont-have-to-be-pain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2007/04/15/taxes-dont-have-to-be-pa...</a><p>In fact any person anywhere in the world whether American or not can volunteer to pay taxes to the US government even if he doesn't have a single US-based customer. All you have to do is incorporate in the US with an American nominee director+secretary and yourself as the sole shareholder. Then it's up to you whether you want to tell your local government about all the profits your American business is raking in.<p>Delaware in particular makes it hard for foreign governments to find out exactly who owns a particular corporation there. This is why you sometimes hear America referred to as the world's largest tax haven:
<a href=""http://www.lectlaw.com/filesh/bbg33.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lectlaw.com/filesh/bbg33.htm</a><p>However, for an American citizen living overseas and trying to run a small business, the main reason to incorporate in the US (rather than whatever country you're living in) is not to evade foreign taxes, but to avoid American paperwork. American owners of foreign corporations have to file form 5471 and spend all their time worrying whether any of their income can be classified under Subpart F (particularly Foreign Base Company Services Income --- look it up if you'd like your head to explode), in which case it DOES get taxed in the US as if it were a dividend to you personally. If you're Google and you want to pretend that your office in Bermuda with zero programmers and three lawyers is actually a major profit centre for software income, this is easy. If you're one guy selling bingo software, this is much harder, because you don't have the money to hire an international tax lawyer. Thanks President Kennedy!<p>Right now all the multinational corporations are deferring US taxes on their foreign subsidiaries by using Form 8832 declarations to create ""hybrid entities"" (ones which different governments disagree are corporations or pass-through entities). This all started back in 1997, when the IRS amended the entity classification rules in response to perceived abuses. Next year that law might get amended to make that impossible (Obama already tried last year, but failed), at which point all the high-priced accountants and lawyers will comb through the new regulation to find some other bright idea, while I hide under my pillow and cry.<p>Anyway, rant over, here comes the point I promised: US laws, whether in the field of immigration or taxation or whatever, may start out simple, but they inevitably get amended into increasing complexity until they make no sense at all, because unlike, say, the laws of Vanuatu, there's so many people looking for loopholes. Thus the laws manage to ensure that no one abuses process X, by making it damn near impossible for anyone, abusive or not, to get through process X in the first place. So I don't really have high hopes for this startup visa bill. It may pass, and in the first year hopefully some genuine foreign entrepreneurs will grab on to the chance to get a foothold in the US. But then there will be abuses, or maybe only perceived abuses blown out of all proportion by the media (or by disgruntled competitors who use PR agents to plant stories in the media), and then the law will get amended into oblivion starting from year two.",1289750467

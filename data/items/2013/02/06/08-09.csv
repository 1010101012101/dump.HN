5175521,comment,5174482,5174719,2,0,jerfelix,,,"Correct me if I am wrong, but the prevailing thought when that article was written (1992) was that digital currency would resemble more of a transferred digital coin, with signatures representing each transaction.  So if I had coin #12345, and I transferred it to you, I would digitally sign it to you giving your private key the spend capability.<p>With those architectures, a central authority would be required to prevent the double-spend.  And with those architectures, the coins grow with each spend.<p>The difference with Bitcoin (which I think is totally misnamed) is that it's not a coin architecture, it's a ledger architecture.  So no matter how many times the amount 1BTC is transferred, each transfer <i>could be</i> just the same length - the sender's address, the recipient's address, and an appropriate signature.  Even 50 years from now and ten thousand transfers of that ""coin"" later, the ""coin"" doesn't get larger.<p>The ledger gets larger, but the coin does not (since really there's no such thing as a ""bit COIN"" - really what you have is a series of account numbers in the giant shared ledger.)",1360140549

Legacy Code: No matter what, there will be some part of Windows that will behave oddly and not upto current standards. I use multiple Wi-Fi networks and my iPhone, iPad and my friend's Windows Phone automatically use proxy settings for that network. Windows 8 needs a manual change.<p>2. Slapped On Metro: Metro feels very unpolished.

Some violin players and mathematicians may get by on doing only the hard stuff, but most have to apply for grants, participate in conferences, transcribe/arrange, maintain equipment, etc.<p>For a startup founder I think this is especially true. A lot of the things you do won't be very cognitively demanding. That doesn't mean you can skip it if you want to get anywhere. It doesn't even mean those 'menial' task create less value in your context than the hardcore 100% concentration parts.<p>Maybe when you've settled down to a predictable working pattern and managed to configure your environment to cater to all the necessary but trivial tasks (and create enough value in your 4 hours to pay for other people taking care of the rest) you can realize this.

It also supports an easy transition from PostgreSQL native, record and array types to JSON, and it supports a wide range of the SQL XML standard.<p>However, there's still something missing. PostgreSQL lacks support for XQuery. It lacks support for querying parts of JSON structure, although there's an external extension for that. And it lacks decoding JSON into native/record/array types.<p>So for a pure document store, PostgreSQL would require you to add lots of userdefined functions for handling your JSON structures.<p>However, PostgreSQL is great for hybrid approaches, when you separate your documents into content and metadata, i.e. free-structured JSON and hard-structured native types.",1360140216

I didn't say that someone won't ""know if this branch is tested because it uses an if"" - obviously, they won't get certification if they don't <i>know</i>.<p>But the point is, they will have to write <i>MORE</i> tests to prove this knowledge.  In other words, <i>BREAK</i> the conditions of the if statement in order to test - so simulate a full bitrot scenario on the conditional-branch.  We've actually had to write tests to do this, but then been able to rewrite the code to use goto, effectively and without any of the disadvantages you mention - in fact, reducing the cyclomatic complexity of the entire system.  This is a good thing.<p>Bit rot, not common?

At the same time the Clover Trail platform is fast enough to run Win32 desktop apps and the tablet comes with a pressure-sensitive Wacom pen, so it's a pretty great little machine for sketching and painting. I rather like the refreshed Office 2013 apps too, they're fine for mixed touch and pen input.<p>The Thinkpad Tablet 2 is also much less expensive than the Surface Pro, so I'm very happy with this choice... On the other hand I realize that my needs are those of a minority. The market for 10-inch Wacom tablets is presumably not that great.

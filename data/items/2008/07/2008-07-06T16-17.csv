Motivation isn't something you can turn on or off, so it's not within the duplicators' control to duplicate that. But it is within their control to observe better. If I were going to make a YC clone and I didn't have that piece, I'd think twice about bothering.<p>Incidentally, I'm just basing this on what I've read. I haven't met any of the people involved.",1215363075

237868,comment,236853,237821,0,0,gruseom,,,"Great line. It is, however, orthogonal to the subject of institutionalized child care.<p>Smart people I know who don't have children are often a source of great observations about child rearing in general and even specific parenting situations. That's the positive side of your point, and I've used it many times to get a read on what I might be missing.<p>The mistake they make is not in their observations, which as I said are often very rational, but in assuming that they themselves would do better. What makes parenting hard is that your emotions are involved in a way that is far deeper and more complicated than anything you've experienced before. It's easy to be a ""good"" parent when that condition is absent, for the same reason it's easy not to get hypothermia in Florida.",1215362283

237862,comment,237786,237786,0,0,akeefer,,,"In my experience the pitfalls of inheritance are something you have to really see for yourself in practice, so it generally takes even very good developers years to really develop the intuition around when to use inheritance and when to use composition.  Inheritance is a blunt tool that's easy to use, while composition is trickier and requires more skill and foresight to use correctly.  There are also more different styles of composition that accomplish slightly different things, so you have to know which one will work best for your problem.  My personal experience is also that many people just don't understand compositional models as readily either.<p>One of the big problems, though, is that inheritance is much easier in most programming languages than composition is.  Java, for example, has absolutely no support for composition or delegation, whereas inheritance requires a single keyword.  C++ has multiple inheritance, which you can kind of re-purpose for the sake of composition, but it's still not very elegant and tends to just exacerbate the misuse of inheritance instead.  Ruby has a pretty elegant mixin model, and you can pretty much do whatever you want in Javascript if you're willing to roll the solution yourself (I confess that my Python knowledge is more limited so I have no idea if there's support there), but the most mainstream OO languages require you to really fight them in order avoid using inheritance inappropriately.",1215361161

The current tools on Linux are either completely underpowered or non-existent, so I frequently move code to my OS X box or even to OpenSolaris running in VMWare. Just to use dtrace.",1215361152

Now that Python is the language du jour, it may be that choosing C/C++ for the server side development is only attracting the people that are really good with C/C++.  Admittedly, it would take a certain kind of personality to work on a webapp with a C backend.  Perhaps this is an asset.",1215361144

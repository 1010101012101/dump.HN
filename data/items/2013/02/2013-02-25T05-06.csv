5277546,comment,5276851,5276851,10,0,dpeck,,,"DF is a fantastic game, and one worth taking some time to explore if you have a weekend to burn when friends and family are out of town, or you're just feeling like being a shut in. It is an excellent example of a ""forever project"" and one that has gained some quite a fanbase, but as you get deeper in, you will be frustrated by some things.<p>The game is designed by 2 brothers, and coded completely by one of them. This has led to a game with immense scope, and tons of features, but with most of them lacking polish. Its also led to performance problems, as adding new features is vastly more important than optimizing existing ones. The game is single threaded, outside of some of the gui, and processors aren't really getting any faster. Eventually you'll get frustrated and kill your fortress due to FPS slowdown. This could happen from your fort growing to a large number of dwarfs, or you playing too much with things that flow (lava, water), etc.<p>There have been quite a few offers by fans of the game to help with the code, but Toady One is adamant about keeping the source closed and being the only developer.<p>So play, enjoy, and be impressed with what one guy and a lot of Mountain Dew can accomplish, but be aware that you're playing in what is essentially someones (amazing) lifetime art project.<p>PS: Dwarf Therapist and DfHack make the game much more playable and get around a lot of the interface quirks. If you're going to get started playing I'd recommend them.",1361771949

Lack of pain is not a conclusive negative indicator.<p>I don't want to throw people into a panic, and I don't know the percentages, but I do recall reading that some cases of celiac disease can be relatively or completely pain free.<p>No, that doesn't mean ""everyone"" has the disease.  Just that, when considering whether to make a diagnosis, pain is not a conclusive factor.  (IANAD, and this is to the best I recall from some fairly casual and brief reading.)",1361771945

My mother in law for example (as a retired nurse even!) thinks breastfeed is ""disgusting"" and how ""it can kill babies because they can get smothered"". I was just floored when I heard that from her telling it to my wife. Now we didn't listen of course to such crazy talk. But I wonder where it came from. One suspicion is lobbying and re-education campaigns of formula manufacturers. What better way to make a pretty penny than convince women to stop feeding their children like they have since the dawn of time and instill in them the belief that it is ""disgusting"" and ""animalistic"". It would take an enormous drive and a sustained campaign to do that. But I don't really have any other explanation for it.",1361771369

And if you're excited about learning to code, you'll find yourself building cool stuff in no time.

...<p>Yeah. You are right about the fact that a possible ""convention"" would be to call .len, not .__len__ but you are forgetting 20+ years of backward compatibility.<p>I don't know when len() was introduced, and I'm not sure it's initial implementation was a simple ""return object.__len__()"" (or an equivalent...).
What I know is that an explicit len function helped to <i>hide</i> the eventually different implementation details, and allowed the developers of the containers go crazy with attributes.<p>Moreover, with a len(obj) function and a obj.len() ""public"" method, you have two ways to do it.",1361769299

We can't expect perfect hindsight but predicting how politics develops in states focused on the extraction of natural resources and close ethnic ties isn't rocket science. Highly organized ethnic groups take control and use oil resources to maintain political support.  It is why strongmen in the middle east so often come from ethnic or religious minorities. (Syria, Iraq to name a few). Tribal structures make it impossible for a liberal opposition to build a winning coalition.<p>Democracy isn't magic and just suggesting that we should help democratic parties when we can is a 'no kidding' suggestion.",1361769163

Then you want to add dependency checking, so you use the wildcard to convert between <i>.o to </i>.d, keeping the same folder structure.<p>And I don't want the <i>.o and </i>.d files to be generated where the <i>.c files live, so I need to add this code here that converts the paths.<p>OOPS, this project uses a slightly different folder structure, and so I need to add a case where it looks in DIFFERENT relative paths.<p>Oh dear; I just realized that I need this code to work ALMOST the same in a different project that needs to be built with the same Makefile; that means I need to include it twice, using different options each time.<p>And it turns out that it DOESN'T work the way I expect, so now I have to use $(eval), meaning some of my Make variables are referenced with $(VAR), and some with $$(VAR), depending on whether I want them to grab the CURRENT version of the variable or the calculated version.<p>But now, now I have all of my code to create my project in one convenient place, and creating a new project Makefile is quite trivial! It's all very clean and nice. But the next person to try to change the folder structure, or to otherwise try to get this now-crazy-complicated house of cards to do something that I didn't anticipate has to become just as adept at the subtleties of $(eval ...) and Makefile functions (define ...); error messages when you get things wrong tend to make early C and C++ compiler errors look straightforward and useful by comparison.<p>For a far more complicated example, take a look at the Android NDK Makefile build system. 5430 lines of </i>.mk files that make your life very easy...right up until you want to do something they didn't anticipate, or until they ship a version with a bug (which they've done a several times now) that screws up your build.<p>Here's one small excerpt for your viewing pleasure, just to get the flavor:<p><a href=""http://pastie.org/6331932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/6331932</a>",1361769111

The result is cheaper service since it doesn't include the hidden costs of recovering phone subsidies (approximately $20 per month).<p>This will mean that US consumers will be seeing the true hardware price for the first time, and be able to make value judgements.  Of course everyone expects the whole thing will fail because Americans are used to cell phones being really cheap, and tmobile has to try to convince people by doing arithmetic on lifetime costs, which is a far harder (and more complicated) sell.<p>I'm extremely sceptical that consumers will pay more for Firefox phones than iPhone and top end Android.  And I have no doubt they'd pick Firefox (or anyone else for that matter) for phones that are ""free"", $50 or similar amounts, but those phones won't exist on tmobile except for feature phones around the $150 mark.  Given a choice between a $350 Firefox or Android phone it will be interesting to see what happens, and the consumer will have to strongly consider if they are getting that much value from their purchase.",1361768702

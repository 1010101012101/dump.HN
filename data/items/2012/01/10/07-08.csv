You're saying that it's a moot point because you asked if they would use it and they said yes, but then they didn't actually use it.<p>But the thing you have to guard against most in customer development is a false positive (am I using that right?), where people say they will sign up, buy, whatever, but then they don't. So anything you can do to get closer to a fully validated yes is worth it.<p>Lots of ideas are neat and things I might say I'd use, but will I whip out my credit card and give you $20 / month or whatever? The ideal is to get a commitment to pay before you build (prepay, pay $1 for the beta, kickstarter, whatever).<p>However, I think if you had really asked that question and really hammered whether they'd PAY, you might have gotten a little more honesty about whether they would actually <i>value</i> it. You wouldn't have gotten perfect honesty, but I bet the enthusiasm would have waned significantly if you had asked ""would you pay $20 / month for this"" instead of ""would you use this"".<p>But sometimes it just sucks and it goes wrong in the end no matter what you do.<p>I'm working on a project that's very similar in terms of stage, needing to be validated, uniqueness, etc. So my plan is to reach out to a ton of people, see if they have the problem, see if they'd pay for the solution, and then build a landing page <i>with a giant price on it</i> and see if I can get people to click on the sign up button.

I just wanted to clarify something:<p><i>win just by showing up, not by building a [great] app</i><p>This is explicitly NOT what I said. I don't think you can <i>win</i> in the long run without creating something great, but great and super premium aren't the same thing. I've bought apps for $1.99 that were great that I would never have paid $19.99 for because they just didn't provide that much value. So what I was trying to say was that if you're going to try and create something worth $19.99 in value, you can either pick a saturated area and try to be the super premium offering, OR you can pick a completely underserved but hungry niche and create something good that solves a need.",1326179562

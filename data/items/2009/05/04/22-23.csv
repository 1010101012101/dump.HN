SQL databases are powerful relational engines in their own right - many ORMs have to replicate a lot of that functionality into their memory based stuff (which can be good, but its more work).<p>I guess its all slowly fading, as I am led to believe the trend is away from relational data to distributed data, which has a different set of problems...",1241477847

593250,comment,593020,593020,0,0,wicknicks,,,"The arguments about language efficiency on a single processor machine are probably outdated today. Most machines have multiple cores. We need good tools which can exploit this CPU architecture. Languages like C/C++ place a large amount of responsibility on the shoulders of a programmer. Effectively, you are writing two programs - one for the task at hand, and the other is memory allocation for it. Control does not always give speedup, also it is not always a boon. It implies managing the different resources on your own. In a large scale application, this is not a great idea. GC is a good alternative over Malloc and Free'ing when the size of the application gets huge.<p>Also, the scalability of a single system is limited. If you really need extra speed, I think going parallel is the key. Most numerical methods are parallelizable. And C/C++ were not created keeping this mind. It can be a programmer's nightmare to debug multiple threads with memory leaks. Languages like Java do make this task easier using programming paradigms like Map/Reduce.",1241477651

The Google ideas he cites fall into those categories.<p>Microsoft's most brilliant ideas were always about how to sell their products and maximize profits.  A fascinating example of this is Gates' memo to Apple about licensing the Mac.<p><a href=""http://www.scripting.com/specials/gatesLetter/text.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scripting.com/specials/gatesLetter/text.html</a><p>Common wisdom is that Windows became the standard because Apple did not license Mac technology.  Very early on, Gates explained the rationale for this to Apple and even suggested potential partners for licensing agreements.<p>So it seems the ""ideas"" behind Mac OS were not as valuable as Gates' and Microsoft's business sense.<p>(If you want to cite Apple's resurgence as a refutation, I would argue that the maturation of Jobs' business sense is behind that.  He has been brilliant in negotiating deals that favor Apple since his return, has done a better job competing on price than people realize, and has undeniably manufactured customer demand for Apple products.)",1241474878

I could be mistaken, but by that definition, isn't any user AI created in a videogame/virtual world parameters passing the test? If so, users of Garry's Mod and the more complex Wiremod coupled with it passed it ages ago...and with more style. :)",1241474835

This is in reaction to languages such as Perl that have several ways to do the same thing, sometimes with counter-intuitive differences in performance. It's good to ask whether the benefit of adding feature X to the language is worth the cost of making it that much larger.<p>While I would choose a different subset of features, I think he's got a good point.",1241474823

But you might want to go into practice for a couple of years to get the feel for information flow in a law firm and the places where you can leverage your expertise.  I suppose you could go the IT route in a firm, if you really dont want to get into law.

If you believe sourcing could be found for a topic, and a better article could be written, go write it.

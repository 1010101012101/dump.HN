4127029,comment,4125198,4125808,3,0,beagle3,,,"> No one is asking you to ""just believe"" research;<p>Did you read the study the parent post is talking about? A well funded laboratory, that was trying to not ""just believe"" research (as everyone else apparently does) was trying to replicate these results. If the science was good, all it should have taken is time and money (both of which they had enough of). And yet, 47 out of 53 celebrated results published in peer reviewed papers of the highest caliber <i>could not be replicated</i> . Let that sink for a minute before you reply.<p>> there is _no_ reason to say that all research cannot be trusted.<p>Ok. Your reason to state that research can be trusted is that it is eventually replicated (thus confirmed), or thrown out (thus shown false), is that right? (You didn't state that as your reason, so perhaps you have other ideas -- but that's a common one, so I'll reply to it).<p>Assuming that's the case -- do you have any idea what percentage of results are replicated? And how much time after official publication?<p>Because if it takes e.g. 30 years until a bad publication is discredited, and (as the data point given by the parent shows) there are areas in which 90% of the data apparently can be discredited when you try to replicate it -- then, there actually might be reason to distrust research in general, because at any given point in time, more than 90% of non-discredited published results are wrong.<p>See also <a href=""http://saveyourself.ca/articles/ioannidis.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://saveyourself.ca/articles/ioannidis.php</a> (and the paper it references). This situation is not science fiction. 90% un-replicatable publications is probably limited to very few subjects. But 50% overall in medicine and biology is totally believable.<p>Which is not to say science (the abstract idea / discipline / method) is wrong - it's right. It's just that the things we human practice and often call ""science"" is very, very far from the ideal of science. Ignore that at your own peril.",1340035144

Current problems with web apps are things like lack of keyboard shortcuts (without the browser getting in the way).
Browser chrome wasting space in the UI and an overall more ""laggy"" feeling than a native app.<p>All of these problems however can (have?) be improved upon.
UI consistency will be the last great bastion however, whenever I use a web app I have to spend a considerable amount of time figuring out where everything will be in the UI, this is even true for things like gmail.<p>Perhaps there will become a defaco standard widget set for web apps?",1340035074

On most VPS providers (as with dedicated hosting) the first question you answer when you go to deploy your web app is ""what Linux distro do you want to run?"" If you're trying to learn sys admin skills, that's great, but for most people, the end goal is to deploy a web app, not run a Linux box.<p>With dotCloud, you start higher up: list the components (eg Python web frontend, MySQL and Redis) that make up your actual application, push your code and you're handed back a URL with your app running. A single command lets you scale out for reliability, with load balancing across your multiple web front-ends and master-slave replication for your databases. Running a single physical server? Sure, not <i>that</i> hard.  Setting up reliable, automated failover for every component in your stack? That's a bit more work.<p>In the end, it's really a question of the value of your time. Can you do all your own sys admin work? Sure. You could also build and maintain your own hardware, but from the sounds of it, you've decided that work is worth outsourcing Hetzner.<p>In the same way, for a lot of people, wasting time administering servers is just time taken away from building a real business: a distraction that is worth paying a few extra dollars a month to make disappear.",1340034930

It's mis-selling, and as such it is almost always illegal, but it's close enough to plausible that most people who would be in those stores in the first place won't be confident enough to challenge it.<p>There's also a certain arrogance about some stores these days, and not just the ones staffed by 12-year-olds. I went to buy a new iPad a few days after they launched. Apple somehow seemed to be price-fixing without getting called on it, because <i>everywhere</i> was charging the <i>exact</i> same price for a high-value, prestige product in short supply, which doesn't sound like a competitive market to me. Still, I figured if those were the rules of the game then I might as well go where they seemed most likely to have stock: the Apple store.<p>Two Apple staff eventually asked if they could help me. I told them exactly which model of new iPad I wanted. One said that he didn't think they had any in stock and wasn't sure when they'd be back in, but he'd go and check. He came back several minutes later, having apparently sent someone else off to check the stock for him in the interim, and proudly declared that he was right: they really didn't have the product I wanted that was advertised all over their window display, and they really didn't have a clue when it would next be available. Then he grinned bizarrely, as if I was supposed to be impressed by his awesome level of customer service or something.<p>I walked next door to John Lewis, where I easily found a friendly member of staff, who in turn walked about five metres to a terminal and told me within about ten seconds that they did have what I wanted. She then personally went to the store room and returned two minutes later with the correct box, personally checked that she really had found the item I wanted, and put it behind the till reserved for me until I was ready to leave.<p>Guess where I'm going next time...",1340034854

Ad-Hoc SQL in VoltDB is a current area of focus in VoltDB development. We use similar compilation and expect them to be no slower than our stored procedures in the 2012 timeframe.

That's probably true for simple SQL operations for the time being. It gets murkier once you consider VoltDB features like materialized views that avoid table-scans altogether.

Here's some interesting stuff I've found lately:<p>1. In order to establish a chain of trust, the server is going to be sending your browser at least 2 (server cert, ca) if not more certificates, which contain a fair amount of plain text, so there is some bandwidth overhead here.<p>2. The most computationally expensive part of SSL setup is the challenge/response key verification step, which generally involves RSA (public/private keys) rather than AES (symmetric keys).<p>3. SSL session reuse is an interesting feature, on one hand it allows you to skip (2), but if those session keys aren't stored securely server side, it opens up an attack vector. So just remember to make sure those values are as secure as your server's private key.<p>4. In order to skip (2) many servers such as apache have support for a type of ""memcached like"" distributed key value store allowing instances to share session data called dc. <a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslsessioncache"" rel=""nofollow"">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslsession...</a>",1340034530

So if they have tried passing along info they've found the same information passed along that they can't act upon so the feedback loop no longer exists.<p>3) The person who you give the suggestion to is lame and it never gets passed along because they suck (which is why they are in that front facing position and not higher up).<p>4) The higher ups have never worked at the lower level jobs.

DotCloud is <i>affordable managed hosting</i>: we do the work of operating, monitoring, maintaining which you would otherwise need to do yourself. And we do it better and more cost-effectively than our customers could do it, because it's all we do for hundreds of thousands of deployments.<p>- dotCloud scales down way better than iaas.

When I say we had to wait a couple hours, it was because I was looking for a paper from ""The Russian Journal of Chemistry"" from 1912.  We had a vendor who could track down anything.  For any of the big journals, we had the same access as academia.<p>2. We agree on this point.  If a lab experiment is used in a later project, it HAS to work or else the future work can't occur.  However, lots of projects have ""arms"", where the experiment is an interesting observation that is never pursued.  These are often ""one-off"" experiments that are published, but never repeated in the same lab.<p>3. I am by no means painting academics with a broad brush here.  I think most academic research is done on the up-and-up and the results are valid, if not hard to replicate (this is research!).  I think one issue is the one pointed out in the parent comment.  You run 5 reactions, two fail and the three that work produce yields of 50%, 70% and 80%.  What gets published? 80%.  The devil is in the details.  In big pharma, you are trying to make a drug and the science better work or else you can't bring it to market.  Much higher standards for reproducibility.<p>4. I guess my thought here is based on the fact that big pharma typically hires from academic labs.  All those post-docs and senior scientists with years of experience?  That's who big pharma hires.  So overall, I would imagine that the level of experience in big pharma is greater than the average you would see in academia (which makes sense since academia is training for working in places like big pharma).<p>Once again, I always shy away from descriptions that put all ""big pharma"" or ""academic"" researchers into one pile.

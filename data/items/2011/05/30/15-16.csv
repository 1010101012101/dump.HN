And given it is quite unlikely that there was a meeting 100,000 years a go in Africa where we as a species decided - ""let's give overrunning the whole planet a go"" I think that ""instinct"" for want of a better word is what drives that. Living in a sustainable way does not come naturally to humans - I'm betting you are well educated and have reasoned long and hard about it.<p>Yes there are people like you who chose to be sustainable. But unless you get <i>everyone</i> to do it then we are screwed. Because it's an all or nothing plan. And you may love making your own food but by the same token I am really glad someone else is doing it for me. I find it boring and a waste of my time - I want to just be able to get food when i need it without thinking about it. My interests lie elsewhere.<p>Likewise the global trend is <i>too</i> the city. Every bit of research points to <i>massive</i> urbanisation <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/aug/18/percentage-population-living-cities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/aug/18/percenta...</a><p>We has a species <i>do</i> have the ability to overcome our animal urges but if you don't solve the power problems you are doing to need <i>everyone</i> to do it and the failure mode of that is massive suffering. There are various sustainable living and back to nature and even so called luddite movements and have been for quite a while but I still don't see them being a significant force.<p>There is nothing wrong with what you are doing at all but do you think you can convince everyone you know outside of your community to join in?",1306771137

But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography.

Deutschland und Norwegen vernetzen sich: Die Bundesnetzagentur hat den Weg fr eine direkte Stromverbindung zwischen Deutschland und Norwegen durch die Nordsee frei gemacht. Das Konsortium NorGer erhielt am Donnerstag eine Ausnahmegenehmigung der Bonner Behrde. Sie befreit das Projekt damit von bestimmten Vorschriften zur Regulierung des Energiemarkts. Agenturchef Matthias Kurth nannte die Entscheidung ein positives Signal fr die Integration erneuerbarer Energien.<p>>Eine Funktion des 600 Kilometer langen Unterseekabels wird es sein, Netzschwankungen aus der norwegischen Wasser- und deutschen Windkraft auszugleichen. Niedersachsens Umweltminister Hans-Heinrich Sander (FDP) lobte den Beschluss: Ich bin davon berzeugt, dass die Verbindungsleitung eine sinnvolle Ergnzung zum landseitigen Netzausbau darstellt. Das Kabel soll ab 2015 von Flekkefjord an der norwegischen Sdkste ber den Meeresgrund bis an die ostfriesische Kste fhren. Fr den deutschen Abschnitt wurde bereits im Mai ein Raumordnungsverfahren gestartet. Der innereuropische Stromhandel wird nach Einschtzung Kurths von der deutsch-norwegischen Direktverbindung profitieren. Die Gleichstrom-Leitung leiste einen wichtigen Beitrag fr die Marktintegration. Eine Voraussetzung fr die Befreiung von den blichen Bestimmungen zum Netzanschluss und -zugang sei gewesen, dass sich das Projekt insgesamt positiv auf den Stromwettbewerb auswirkt. Das Bundeskartellamt sprach sich ebenfalls fr eine Genehmigung aus. Zwar knne die EU-Kommission als oberste europische Wettbewerbsbehrde bis Ende Februar noch Einwnde erheben, sagte Kurth. Ich gehe aber davon aus, dass dieses grenzberschreitende Projekt auch von ihr untersttzt wird. Norwegen ist kein EU- Mitglied, gehrt jedoch zur Europischen Freihandelszone EFTA.

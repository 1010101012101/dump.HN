And if it's because it's DHH, does his love of MacBook Air significantly change a market or industry?  And if all else fails, is it interesting, and did I learn anything?  In my mind, it's a resounding no.",1203260272

However, I've never seen data recovered from a hard drive that had been overwritten once with only zeros (no random data and only on pass). I've also seen heated debates in online forums over this topic. I really wish someone would take this challenge and put an end to this debate once and for all.",1203260155
117587,comment,117533,117573,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Sorry, I didn't actually mean you should try to go straight for the global optimum (I'd argue there's probably no such thing) - I'm just wondering about <i>known</i> local optima. Solutions that already exist. I don't necessarily know about startups, but in open source software, it seems that a lot of the time, there's some slick and cool new take on a problem. As it becomes popular, it eventually just grows in the direction of all the other solutions that are out there, becoming yet another bloated clone. It seems to me that if you find yourself going down that road, you should steer against that trend. Or should you?",1203259890

I'm expecting the score to represent _my_ feelings about the article after I read it, not yours.<p>I could go down a longer list: because mob rules is a not-so-good policy for quality reading material, because if one group votes on agreement and another group votes on quality then the agreement group ""drowns out"" the quality group, because it takes about 2 seconds to determine whether you agree with something, whereas determining if something is worth reading takes a lot longer (and is more valuable information), etc.<p>Note that I upmodded you, even though I take issue with your position. That's because you asked a good question. In another world, I'd just downmod you because I thought you were mistaken and for most readers the question would never have been asked (or answered)",1203259843

                 So some good goals, in my opinion:

                 Long term: blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

                 Medium term: blah blah blah

                 Short term: blah

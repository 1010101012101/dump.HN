If it's possible to type on a virtual keyboard without feeling the keys, it should be possible to pick up what you're ""typing"" from the tendon movement.<p><i>Most of the 'first class' ideas you think are being overlooked are actually the second case. 3D interfaces</i><p>3D interfaces are a daft idea; <i>this</i> is <i>different</i>. I can say that I completely believe that, and at the same time see it's exactly the sentiment that drives people to the behaviour you describe. I guess the proof of whether it really is different is whether it ever appears and works or not.<p><i>I've used a couple of exotic input devices or methods that work perfectly fine but stand no chance of general acceptance because people have no interest in learning how to use them.</i><p>Me too; I agree and slightly dislike that it is so.",1240337351

I read that I can opt-out of having my paper used outside of my local university though, I'm not sure why that would matter to me but at least that's something.<p>The main thing that worries me with outsourcing these types of things is that how could you defend yourself if the system finds you guilty of plagiarism when the source isn't open. It's not like false-positives can't happened and it seems perfectly reasonable that it should happened with an increasing rate as the system grows.<p>I've learned to use wikis, version control systems (which granted I should have been using prior to that anyways..) and other ways of keeping a history of how my work progresses so that if I at some point would have to defend myself I can actually show the entire process behind something and not just the finished product.<p>My biggest fear when it come to being accused of cheating is getting called out on the spot and then not being able to answer because my brain shuts down, like how many people curse themselves for not being able to answer job-interview engineering questions even though they knew the answer.

1451699,comment,1450518,1450975,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"Here I think you can distinguish between types of regulation. Lots of <i>bureaucracy</i>, with forms to fill in and specific certifications to get can be onerous to startups. For example, having to get FCC approval for wireless devices falls into this category. There isn't really a way around this, other than to make sure the bureaucracy is not excessive, which brings us to a tautology - excessive bureaucracy is excessive.<p>However, much regulation is done proactively, for free. For example, restaurants don't pay for food hygiene inspectors, and if they have good hygiene practices the costs are minimal (and if they don't, we <i>want</i> them to fail.)<p>I agree we want regulation to be of the second type, but sometimes the first type is the only practical way to do it (and you could still make it cheaper, e.g. by doing FCC-compliance tests for free.)<p>Also, in reality there is a sliding scale for small and innovative companies, e.g. PayPal or Pandora.<p>TL;DR Bureaucratic love-ins aside, regulation doesn't need to fall any heavier on the little guy than the big guy, and the little guy can often just ignore it (at least until they are big.)",1277211553

Then, along their journey, there would be a trail to measure the success of whatever it is they believed in or subscribed to.<p>This eliminates the annoying ""survivor bias"" that every skeptic is sure to hide behind. I know it is statistically relevant, but it's still annoying to hear people constantly downplay and scrutinize someones success. Tim Ferris comes to mind. Sure I get it, the guy's no saint, but we <i>can</i> learn from his achievements. Same goes for luck. If you want to justify your lack of achievement by citing how godawfully lucky all your peers are, go ahead, just don't poison other people with that nonsense.<p>Anyway, normal people run their mouth off about how great what they are doing is and then they go out and do it and see what happens! For example I would like to run my mouth about how solid my business principles are and how much I trust in the 37-signals-ish mantra. So I make bold claims about why its true and what it will work (without it having actually worked to date) . And then inevitably I blow up and nobody can cite stupid luck or survivor bias because I've been running my mouth even when I was a nobody.<p>'Course who's gonna read the unfounded ramblings of a nobody eh?<p>The end.",1277211488

There are about 40 instances of the term's use just within the paper and not a single attempt to provide a definition. I'm <i>guessing</i> that it means time studying and work for classes outside of class, but I don't know for sure. A sentence or two to define it would be welcome.<p>I'm also disappointed that the only statistics presented are averages. Averages are really not useful enough to stand on their own, and it'd be very helpful to know the standard deviation at least. From my own experience (at a selective 4-year liberal arts college, for reference), the amount of work people put in varies immensely depending on the person.<p>I would have liked to see statistics broken down by class year as well.

At worse, Microsoft (or whoever) can make an improved version of your code that they copyright, but they couldn't copyright the original version that you released in a way that would prevent others from using it. The biggest difference between licenses is whether you care about those derived works: if someone improved your code, should that improved code also have to stay open source, or is it okay if someone takes the improved version closed-source? If you want to ensure that any improved versions stay open too, then copyleft licenses (the GPL is the main one) are the way to go. If you don't care about that, and only care that the original stays open, then any permissive open-source license is fine (""BSD-style"" licensing).",1277211235

In my dream world there would be a 12 month ban on any player caught diving.  After each game, the refs go through all the footage of the game's fouls, and any player that even looks like he's diving gets banned.

So double all numbers in that post.<p><i>This puts an upper limit on how much the brain can calculate, assuming it is an irreversible computer: 5 </i>10^19 64 bit ops per second.*<p>It's one thing to put a theoretical upper limit on the human brain's computational abilities. It's another thing to claim the human brain actually performs anywhere near that level. Using the same math, a lawnmower engine puts out 1,000 joules per second, so the upper bound on its computational ability is 10^22 ops/sec. I think more than one equation is needed to get a good idea of the brain's performance.<p>Evolved brains are highly suboptimal. There's no evolution fairy waving a wand and selecting solely for brainpower. Much of the selection pressure is for basic things like famine resistance. Even when selecting for intelligence, evolution can only make incremental improvements. It's going to have trouble stumbling on something like the wheel or the impeller. And it shows. Brains have no API, no debugger, and they certainly aren't end-user modifiable. I can't, by thinking, dedicate a small group of neurons to mental arithmetic. I have to expend significant effort to do the math in my head, and even then I'm not always correct.<p>Neurons fire at a rate of only 20 hertz or so, meaning any mental computation has to finish in 100-200 steps for a person to respond in real-time. The signals sent by neurons only travel at around 100 meters per second. That's 0.0000004c. Less than one one-millionth the speed of light! And that's not going to change soon, because evolution can't change substrates. It's forced to use neurons instead of silicon or carbon.<p>>Even if brains are computationally only 1/1000 of their theoretical efficiency<p>Based on what I've said above, I think brains are far far less efficient than that.",1277208929

Usually a sound and an arrow that lights up indicating the direction the elevator is heading next.<p>You get in.  Press your button, and when you get to your next stop, you get off.<p>Now, you might see an elevator open up, and you'll get on.  You'll press a button, and it will go in the opposite direction.  That's because most elevators operate on FIFO.  Obviously, with more complex systems, they can dispatch based on distance, but basically, if the elevator is coming up from the first floor, and a guy on the 5th floor pressed the button first, then you, being on the 3rd floor will just need to wait as the elevator passes you by.

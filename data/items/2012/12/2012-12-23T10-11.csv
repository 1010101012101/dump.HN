Seriously, its getting so old that it start to be a pain to answer it.<p>The world is not so simple that either you have total freedom to do anything, or you have complete locked down control of everything. Some freedom is about maintaining others freedom with the use of restrictions. The most common ones are ""you must not kill, you must not steal"". Those two are social control, but with the goal and effect of more freedom. That's not poison that kills life, rather that is protection preserving life.<p>Having products, be that a phone, a book reader, or a browser that users buy, this same users will think that they are the owner of it and thus in control. If then by technical means someone else actually has the complete control over the thing, that it is at least morally wrong, if not something that should simply be illegal.<p>To take an example, if my browser suddenly got infected with spyware and disabled ad-block, I would get angry and consider that the people behind said spyware should go to jail. If my browser suddenly got pushed with a remote update which by it's developer decision permanent disabled ad-block, I should be completely accepting of it? If Firefox did this, they would get forked as by MPL. If Firefox was proprietary software, no such thing could happen.<p>A foundation that say clear No to giving the developer control as if they had property owership of my phone, my book reader, my browser, is not a foundation about political, social, and technological control. Its about ensuring political, social, and technological freedom by restricting behavior that would normally be considered illegal and immoral if done outside the domain of IT.",1356257291
4959124,comment,4958180,4958553,1,0,brianchu,,,"Understanding that you're a ""newbie to economics"" I'd like to point out that the concept of the production-possibility frontier is misapplied here. The PPF deals with economic efficiency (whether an economy is producing at its potential) and relative allocations of production of capital goods vs. consumer goods. An economy is said to be producing at the edge of its PPF if there is 100% efficiency (full employment). An economy producing at a point under its PPF is associated with inefficiency (unemployment). The way you use the term does not make sense.<p>Secondly, economics is concerned with the efficient allocation of <i>scarce</i> resources among <i>unlimited wants</i>.<p>Human want is insatiable, and that's a pretty fair assumption. Even in some hyper-futuristic world, someone out there is going to want their own planet or some other kind of luxury status good. Even if everyone gets their own planet, you still have the dilemma of the fact that having a planet won't be a luxury good anymore (and something else might). This is one of the fundamental assumptions of economics.<p>Whether or not natural resources are scarce depends on whether you want to factor in resources in the Solar System / universe. Even in that scenario, it's a question of time scale:<p>The problem is that I believe we are likely to achieve levels of automation where 99.99% of human jobs are eliminated before we can utilize natural resources beyond our Solar System, and before we can achieve a point where humans are so satisfied they desire nothing more (excepting the occasional planet or two).",1356257229

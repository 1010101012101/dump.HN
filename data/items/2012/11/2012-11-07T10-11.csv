I suppose it's the last LTS release, but surely the users Valve is targetting would almost all have upgraded past 10.4 by now, and the 12.04 LTS release has already happened. Anything more recent than 11.04 has proper mutli-arch support in dpkg/apt so you can specify that your package needs both 64 and 32 bit versions of some packages.<p>Your approach seems extremely fragile: is seamless 10.04 support such a necessity?<p>Incidentally, your compiled binary is compiled against a more recent libc than was shipped in Ubuntu 10.4, so it will  currently refuse to run on 10.4 anyway. I'm guessing you compiled in on an Ubuntu 12.04 install, since it has a hard requirement for a libc version 2.15 or above. This means it won't run on anything older than Ubuntu (12.04), nor will it run on the current or the next Debian release.",1352285858

Common component of rhetorical arguments, especially by economically minded people.<p>For example, fre market economists are usually pro economic immigration: Let resources (labour) go to their highest value use. If a graphic designer can make more in an Oslo design office than they can in Bucharest, there is a potential economic surplus. Opponents might make some objections: there will be increased unemployment among local graphic designers, the immigrants will mean increased costs in local services.<p>The economist-proponent looks at the surplus. Going from a 7k salary to 50k. Adjusted for costs, he calculates a 25k surplus. All the opponents objections can be overcome with 5k at most: new job training centres, schools and hospitals. He throws in another 5k to make the argument stick. He can have his immigration and unemployment will go down, hospitals & schools will be better funded, design firms will have better/cheaper designers and the immigrant will have a better income - <i>even after they charge him 10k a year</i>.<p>Makes sense on paper. It's a good way of simplifying an argument by creating an on paper ceteris parabus. When it actually makes it into policy ir law, it can be arbitrary and unfair at the best of time (eg immigrants pay higher taxes). It's also a potential faucet for funding that the hungry will flock to.<p>The weed smoker has a lot to gain. Lower prices. Better quality. Reduced stigma. Easier access. Not getting put locked a cage. Well worth the $500 per year.",1352285679

4752983,comment,4748624,4752891,2,0,gd1,,,"It doesn't really matter <i>why</i> anyone is in the market.  The fact is that they are posting prices to the limit order book, and in doing so providing liquidity and accepting risk and providing a service.  The only way the OP could get executed passively is by offering a price equal to or better than the market price, yes?  So someone got a better price (or more liquidity at the prevailing price) by him being there.<p>There are really only two actions in a market, providing liquidity (i.e. market-making) or taking liquidity (including arbitrageurs).  Stretching the shopkeeper analogy, any time you put a price tag on an item you are taking a risk and exposing yourself.  You slap a price on some bananas and then there is a tropical cyclone (it happened in Australia) and the price of bananas doubles.  Someone smart swoops in (call them an arbitrageur), grabs your bananas and goes to the till and you legally have to sell them to him even though they're worth double now.  You also have inventory risk, if you're holding a lot of bananas out back then there is the chance that they go rotten.<p>Every limit order (an offer to sell, or bid to buy) has an inherent risk that you should expect to be compensated for (or you wouldn't do it), and enhances the market.  The more competition amongst people posting prices the better, it just means more liquidity (you can buy or sell as many bananas as you want) and tighter prices.<p>The liquidity taker on the other hand is all about exploiting a misprice.  Say, Intel release earnings and are down 10%, but the price of the highly correlated ARM hasn't moved yet, if you are the fastest you can take advantage of some poor person who still wants to buy ARM at the same price as before this information was known.  Keep in mind here, a price can move without any trades happening (or goods changing hands).  The shopkeepers can whip around and change the price tag on their bananas if they are fast enough before anyone buys them.<p>It is harder to justify the liquidity taker - what marginal advantage is there to having the price of ARM react to that news in 2 milliseconds rather than 20?  They force the transmission of information yes, but why is it better to have it happen a bit marginally quicker?  On the other hand, how can you have a realtime market without them? It keeps the providers on their toes, and there will always be someone fastest to react.<p>Incidentally, providing liquidity must have been the chief function of the OP's algo - 4000 trades a day doesn't work for a liquidity taker that has to cross the spread.  He isn't getting 2000 mis-price signals a day to swing at, good enough to justify crossing the spread.  DAX traded 120k contracts yesterday, he would have been averaging 2-3% of daily flow.",1352285603

4752979,comment,4751489,4751649,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Also he looks at the future through the lens of today. When you do this you can easily get into a situation where you find a way that it is just not possible for something to work the way it does today using a new technology, and that causes you to discount the value of the technology but it should also prompt you to consider the possibility of change. For example, smartphones are bad for making voice calls on, but people tend to use their smartphones for other things than making voice calls these days.<p>One thing that I think might happen is that various consumer items may become even more disposable (or perhaps more recyclable). More than that, I suspect that manufacturing itself may become increasingly viewed as a temporary, disposable utility. Right now making most goods requires extensive capital investment in factories and assembly lines, which tend to be large permanent fixtures. But what if manufacturing could be transitory? What if you only needed to make a small run of something? What if you could bootstrap a production line from a small core of machine tools and then dispose of the materials afterward? What if you could efficiently and rapidly break down the production line into its component recyclable parts?<p>Coupled with completely automated configurable manufacturing I think these innovations will revolutionize our relationship with manufactured goods and with manufacturing. Manufacturing will not be something one consumes it will be something that most people do (either through proxies or through ""disposable"" production lines or both). The era of cloned consumer goods may give way to an era of boutique goods and to transitory goods. Do you need a radio? Print one off at the corner factory then have it automatically disassembled and 100% recycled when you are done with it. Do you want to give your kids a set of toy soldiers to play with? Set up a quick production line at home and produce a set, then dispose of the machinery. Then recycle the toys when your kids grow bored of them. Don't worry, it'll be just as easy to print more if they want to play with them again.<p>This is a world that will confound our imaginations because it will disrupt the assumptions that are so deep seated we don't even know we have them and it will create new opportunities and change the balance of feasibility in ways that we lack the creativity to think of, yet.",1352285436

That looks like a highly inefficient use of time, energy, and brains.<p>And even then, I'm not sure the zero-sum game provides any service to the rest of the world: zero-sum players base their models on the behaviour of each other, not on the actual performance of companies.

(Strangely enough, there <i>is</i> a dispute about whether the US law allows it). So a group of people to carry out the dirty work needed to be selected, and secret directives needed to be given to many others. A variety of subterfuges had to be used - first, to break the blinding on the written exams (typically, they would assign specific seats to Jewish students as they came into the auditorium and gave their names; the exam papers would then be marked in some way when they handed them in; but there were many other stratagems). Then, they'd send grown men to intimidate, bully, and humiliate school students during the oral exam, to try to ""bury"" them with questions that they couldn't possibly answer, and finally, if they got some uppity gold medalist from the Math Olympiad who <i>would</i> answer them, or someone as strong as Frenkel (who went on to teach at Harvard at age 21), just start lying to their faces.<p>The atmosphere that all this created at MSU and several other institutions was absolutely poisonous. Just the fact of having people in charge who would do all this was demoralizing to the faculty; it was also demoralizing to the students, who could plainly see what was done to their Jewish classmates in the application process, and to all the regular examiners. The application process - which was supposed to be objective in the first place, and not ""holistic"" - was defiled. The greatest irony of the situation is that the mathematics department of the MGU, whose status was mythological, and which these students believed was so indispensable to them, was not even very good during this period. The curriculum had stagnated since the 1950s, and the research was much weaker than it used to be.<p>Incidentally, the lying goes on to the present day - the MSU has never admitted to anything, let alone apologized. Some words were apparently said to Frenkel and some others in private, but for the most part, everyone involved just plays dumb.",1352282481

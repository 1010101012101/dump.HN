298883,comment,298692,298856,0,0,antiform,,,"Actually, a few years ago, after I started implementing a couple of tips I found on Lifehacker and 43 Folders, like Merlin's great ""Inbox Zero"" talk, I did become a lot more productive. I no longer spent several hours a day on email. I never had to spend time wondering what it was that I had to do ""now,"" because I had a list of ongoing projects in one central location listed by priority.<p>The only problem is that the marginal returns on such implementations diminish very quickly, so after you've got the big ones down--like breaking down big, intimidating tasks into smaller, doable ones and realizing that you don't need email to auto-update every 5 minutes at every hour of the day--there's not much to gain from reading productivity blogs.<p>The big problem is that is it easy to get caught up in the huge initial improvements and fail to realize that the time you gain from implementing these marginal improvements is less than the time you already spent on implementing the improvement itself. It's especially bad if you're the typical geek like me and enjoy fiddling with programs and plugins and constantly trying to solve ""third order"" problems, even when they don't actually do anything in practice. However, exploiting this weakness is exactly what most productivity blogs do to keep their traffic up, so I now have a lot more respect for Merlin, who's actually trying to do something about this problem.",1220913944

Even with today's systems, the filesystem can multiplex data across the platters so that the platters mirror each other. Even on a single-platter drive, the file system could just mirror the data on the same platter.<p>* People want increasingly-higher-capacity, smaller, cheaper, thinner, lighter, and cooler laptops. Adding a second magnetic hard drive into a laptop runs counter to all those goals, as does the kind of mirroring described above. The consumer market demands higher capacity over safety.<p>* Solid state hard drives seem to be the future, at least for laptops. It might be practical to install dual SSDs into a laptop since they are smaller and lighter. It might even be practical to have a rotating set of three as a backup system. Eject hard disk #1, then insert hard disk #3. Hard disk #1 becomes the backup. Hard disk #3 gets synced with hard disk #2 until they mirror each other. Then, relabel the disks 1->2, 2->3, 3->1.<p>* People are being encouraged to save (or at least back up) their data on the network if it is really important.",1220913002

The observed behavior correlates strongly, by almost any measure, with both the economic success of the parents and the child's future success. Hypothesis: small behavioral shifts might produce (or ""nudge"") large economic results.'<p>and<p>'Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel laureate for his work in behavioral economics told us about priming—how a subtle influence radically shifts how people act. So, in one experiment people are asked to fill out a survey. In the corner of the room is a computer, with a screen saver running. That's it—nothing overt, just a background image in the room. If the screen saver shows pictures of money, the survey answers are radically different. Danny went through example after example like this where occurred. The first impulse one has in hearing this is no, this can't be the case. People can't be that easily and subconsciously influenced. You don't want to believe it. But Danny in his professorial way says, ""Look, this is science. Belief isn't an option"". Repeated randomized trials confirm the results. Get over it.'<p>'The second impression is perhaps even more surprising—the influences are quite predictable. Show people images of money, and they tend to be more selfish and less willing to help others. Make people plot points on graph paper that are far apart, and they act more distant in lots of way. Make them plot points that are close together, and damned if they don't act closer. Again, it seems absurd, but cheap metaphors capture our minds. Humans, it seems, are like drunken poets, who can't glimpse a screen saver in the corner, or plot some points on graph paper without swooning under the metaphorical load and going off on tangents these stray images inspire...'",1220912855

-""Feature Artists"" -- should be ""featured""
-you have 3 distinct styles on the rhs list, for date/pic/details.  I'd say go with one and make it work, it looks cluttered.  Otherwise the design got a lot slicker!  nice!
-""featured artists"" -- two-line genres go on out of bounds.
-right column header should left-align to that column's boundary (it's sticking out left, at least in chrome)
-orange-colored div is duplicate content w/featured artists (at least in my area) and pushes the map below the fold.
-okay, taking another look, I get it now: the orange-colored div is associated with the map.  you could make that clearer by grouping them visually -- bunched in one div, for instance.  but I actually don't like that choice for what goes on the homepage map: I'd say put the featured artist events on the map, and kill the orange div.
-I second utnick's suggestion for a weekly digest
-I still don't like the adsense, but I like maxklein's suggestion to only show it on secondary pages: you'll keep most of your money (I'd guess that you'd get 5-7 pageviews per visitor on avg, which means you'd lose 15-20% of your ad revenue) and make a much better first impression.

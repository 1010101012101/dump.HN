Do you think google get/need permission to extract titles? Do you think companies that trawl the web and re-license search content ask individual permission?<p>I certainly wouldn't like to release any data without some sort of license. What about default to ""None (All rights reserved)"". But that's an explicitly lame and certainly not about sharing of data.<p>I'm not here to antagonise people here just to supply some data. What do you suggest? <p>The reason i collect the stuff is for personal (not professional) curiosity. The thought behind licensing the data feed I collect was done so that you are free to: <p>A) To Share: to copy, distribute and transmit the work\nB) To Remix: to adapt the work\nC) Attribution: You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use of the work).<p>And can be found at <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/</a>  The intent is not to restrict but to give attribution, share and remix. It would be good it individual users could choose their license. But at the moment there is none. <p>",1191750930

64400,comment,64225,64364,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Thanks for your comments! To continue the discussion:<p>1. A[i] and Ai (that should be subscript) seem pretty similar to me, but I like Ai more, it just seems cleaner. In C# we can write A[i,j,k] for multidimensional indexers, but tensor script seems cleaner still. Again, I think this really depends on background -- someone who actually deals with tensors might find my proposal more attractive. I'm just driven up the wall when I have to write A[i][j][k]. It's so wasteful.<p>2. I'm not sure if it would be harder to navigate with a keyboard -- it seems like something that you'd have to build first and get used to. The idea of implementing these things as macros which compile down to regular syntax really appeals to me, in fact it's what I had in mind. (C++ has awkward features to do this in the STL with templates, and numerous TopCoders include C macros to expand summation, product, or accumulator functions. If they're useful in the heat of the moment, why not in regular usage?)<p>3. Nice. Thanks. At some point I'll have to take on another big product in LISP, I haven't really touched it since I went into scientific computing, and I think my opinion of it was colored by the bare-bones Scheme I was using.<p>4. ""Detecting... would be hard"" -- it doesn't have to be perfect. I mean, if it was perfect, implicitly it would mean 'graphically model arbitrary code'. I'm thinking there are a collection of schemes which might find maybe 80% of what people would call state machines which aren't so bad. Maybe 80% isn't satisfying, but it's a start. Like bug catching codes in compilers, it won't work all of the time, but maybe it's not necessary.<p>It might be easier to reach at it via making a creation and display layer though, you're right.<p>5. It seems like macroexpand is basically what I'm looking for -- at least it's powerful enough to do what I want it to do without too much pain. I'm unfamiliar with Slime's disassemble command, and the first Google page was unhelpful...<p>As for language support for provably correct programs, they sound interesting to me, too. They should definitely not encompass the whole language though. To be honest I'm not really sure that the mathematics is where it needs to be. So many proofs rely on obvious things, not 'obvious' in the naive sense, but actually obvious, and it \nseems like such a pain to program these in that provably correct systems are impossible to use, at the moment. Yet, Doron Zeilberger seems to think otherwise.<p>I don't know how to escape the problem of infinite regress, or, set differently, Godel's incompleteness theorem. Any sufficiently powerful proving system we have is unable to prove it's own consistency, so, as someone who is admittedly unfamiliar with this territory, I don't see where the starting point is for so called provably correct programs. <p>What would you guess the <i>next</i> step in the right direction is?

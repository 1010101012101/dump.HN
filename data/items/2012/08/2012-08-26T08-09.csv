As you suffer other people's bad ideas, you'll learn to recognize and avoid them.<p>3. Practice, practice, practice.<p>About the #1 point, it's very important to read not only fashionable books or things related to your immediate work. Try to be broad: read the classics, even if their ideas seem outdated to you. Read about the history of the field and the old programming languages and systems (you'll notice that things haven't changed that much).<p>Also, try to learn a couple of languages that are really different from each other. If you know Java, learning C# won't give you anything. Good languages to expand your mind are: Racket/Scheme/CommonLisp/Clojure (DSLs, metaprogramming, FP, OO, almost anything ...), Haskell/Scala/ML (""real"" static typing and FP), Smalltalk (like Java but fun!), Factor/Forth ...; explore a couple of them and pick the ones that make you feel ""weird"": those are the ones you'll learn interesting things from.<p>And don't rush: becoming a good programmer will take your whole life; but it's fun and extremely rewarding.",1345970911

I've found that the best learning experiences have been the languages that least resemble what I use daily. I'm a C programmer but for learning purposes I recommend learning a Lisp, ML or Haskell and Prolog. An alternative to Prolog is going through the logic programming chapter of SICP and writing your own Lisp-based logic programming language and having fun with that (I actually used Haskell + Parsec to implement a logic language).",1345970854

From what I gather, you are saying that ants can be described by the mathematical formulas of their behavior. This is true for just about any phenomena. It can be described and calculated. The fact that creatures as simple as ants, completely helpless on their own, can do such incredible things when in groups is most certainly worthy of awe. How many people, with all of our intelligence, could program homogeneous robots that are able to burrow into the ground and meet two tunnels underground from either end by only exchanging rudimentary signals with each other? Not may, if any people could do this.<p>My point is that there is more here than simple math, and it does deserve awe. There <i>is</i> collective intelligence. Ants in a group have an understanding of their surroundings in ways that we cannot comprehend. I tend to view them as neurons of a larger brain. Each neuron receives inputs, processes, and gives an output based on a very simple formula. Put a few hundred million of them together, and you get something that math cannot describe: consciousness. Ants individually are very simple creatures, but en masse are greater than the sum of the parts.<p>I don't think they are the end all be all of evolution nor do I think their methods particularly apply to us, but I think they are worthy of admiration.",1345969771

A doctored image (esp. by NASA) published just gives them another reason to argue that there was never a moon-landing as all the images from it are obviously fake.<p>Second, any reporter must verify his, or her sources, otherwise they are subject to manipulation and if a source is falsifying information, for whatever reason, that information must not be used as the reported cannot know to which degree was the information tampered with.

I guess if your photo archives are supposed to be the bastion of utter truth (i.e. no manipulated one) then it makes sense, because unless you mark is as ""edited"" or similar, other users/people that come across the photo would assume it to be untouched.<p>It depends on how precise you want to be I suppose.",1345969003

4434627,comment,4434553,4434553,10,0,gee_totes,,,"If the question here is <i>How to learn Backbone</i>, my suggestion would be to take one of the to-do app examples and just build and hack on that until you develop the app you want. Try doing it with just built-in backbone functionality; don't override any of the defaults. Use hacking an already built-app to get a feel for the limitations of the framework, which in turn will show you some interesting (for me, at least, coming from MVC world) design patterns.<p>If the question here is <i>Where is a good Backbone tutorial</i>, I encourage you to look at the tutorial on Backbone-Relational (which is a plugin for Backbone):<p><a href=""http://antoviaque.org/docs/tutorials/backbone-relational-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antoviaque.org/docs/tutorials/backbone-relational-tut...</a>",1345968480

Simply put: if your flagship product ever becomes commoditized, your margins die and you die with them. This is why Apple does not want to compete on price - because it's a race to the bottom. Instead it competes on great design and superb user experience. For customers, those things are worth paying prime dollars for. For Apple, they are worth protecting with every weapon they have at their disposal - litigation included.",1345968274

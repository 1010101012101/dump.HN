Nokia is currently the #1 mobile vendor because they sell very (VERY) cheap mobile phone in Asia (especially Hong Kong and South East Asia countries).<p>Those countries have billions citizens compare to North America and I'm almost sure iPhone would be unreachable (in terms of cost) there.  <p>iPod is a different ""thing"". iPod is a market maker (I know other companies have come up with MP3 players before but none of them made a SPLASH).<p>Sometime it is useful to have business or economy skill than just plain programming/coding skill :)",1178160524

Digg was transparent about what they were doing; the community still did not like it.<p>You have to do what your users want, simple as that. If what your users really want is openness and honesty that's what you give them. Digg's users want to be able decrypt dvds (even if in the abstract for most of them). They've had many accusations of lack of transparency in the past that went nowhere. ",1178157987

It's aimed at teaching people how to use an Arduino, and the point of the article is to give a beginners look into it, yet the disclaimer says it's only about the software side.  I'm sorry, but an article about the Arduino should be equally about hardware and software.<p>The real reason I'm saying this is that his diagrams with the LEDs will not work.  The potential across the LED leads is 0.  In fact, on the example with 3 chasing LEDs, it may blow the ports (I don't know know if the pin is an open collector or a current source).",1334185148

3830048,comment,3826364,3826364,1,0,ZephyrP,,,"Come, come<p>Up and coming low-level programmers still exist. I just turned 20 this past January and I've been doing x86 at least once a week for 5 years now, in fact, my meal ticket -- IDA Pro, sits as I type this whirring away at calculating the relocations of some PIC in our favorite browser.<p>While it may be true that that the majority of people with assembly knowledge are slaving on heap sprays more than swizzling pointers or tackling alignment issues these days (or any other ""real"" low level work). All and all, auditing isn't half bad and I suppose the markets agree.<p>I guess to that end, There's going to be no shortage of low level junkies as long as kids still think hackers are cool. Kids are going to be attracted to the cyberpunk glam of hackers (or, naturally, Angelina Jolie's smoking body in 1995). Of course, as it goes, If you want to be any good at that sort of thing, you have to write memory corruption bugs, and if you're writing memory corruption bugs then low level is a necessity.<p>So while it may be true that producing anything save VX crypters in assembly is a dead end, the deep knowledge is immensely rewarding and while it's true you might not be able to erect castles, you can perform some deep machine magicks that will make a few people's heads turn.<p>You unlock many things that many programmers simply dream of -- The ability to reverse applications, to tweak some 'interesting', decidedly-nonoptimal optimizations (LEA is always faster!) and find cleverly exploitable bugs in applications that you don't have to source to.<p>You can optimize in ways that other programmers, no matter how skilled in any other language, simply cannot. A recent and related anecdote is my database ( zv.github.com/artifact ) which, once upon a time, was extremely slow during the mkey exchange when it diffs the hashes against it's own, it was copying every hash and comparing it to every other hash it had received thus far (For when quadratic time is too fast). Normally this would have been a few hours long job to rewrite some pithy external library, write tests and somehow implement speedy string manipulation in Erlang. Nope, HiPE allows you to treat an object file as a module as long as it has the correct export interface. My humble database is now an order of magnitude faster on convergence (This may speak more towards the performance of string processing in Erlang than any personal prowess, but still).<p>So, in conclusion Mr. Andy Firth, it's probably true that the vast majority of people who you are interviewing aren't very good, because hey, that's the central limit theorem at work!<p>However, I assure you, somewhere out there, there's a boy and his linker, learning low level the hard way. If I were you, I'd hit up security and reversing/crackme forums, you're practically guaranteed to find a wizard or two.<p>That's the Circle of life :)",1334184927

Hence the part where I'm thinking out loud regarding how the gc ordering of data after a copy/compact (in the one generation gc) impacts locality. And I suppose this also applies to more modern gc setups like multiple generations or parallel collection. Is there some notion of data locality that we can formalize and analyze for at least simplified versions of modern memory hierarchy? How well do standard gc algorithms perform when analyzed thusly?  How efficient can each style of gc algorithm be if it's designed to optimize locality?<p>It clearly has some relation to optimal caching optimization problems, but with more explicit interdependencies.

Sure, you might like 16:9 more, but most people seem to prefer 4:3 to 16:9. I myself have a 4:3 Android tablet (a mongrel: the HP TouchPad) and I have to say, between using this and a Transformer, I much prefer 4:3 on a tablet. It's easy to hold portrait or landscape, whereas with a 16:9 display, holding it portrait is awkward. Not only that, but 4:3 portrait mimics a book page much better than 16:9 does and so I feel more comfortable with PDFs on 4:3 than 16:9.<p>I think monitors should go back 16:10 (compromise between screen real estate and widescreen appeal) and tablets stay at 4:3 (only because of the use cases for a tablet).",1334184153

I was transported there by a private bus service. It was a long drive. And the only person I had for company in these (small) buses was the person who happened to be driving it. During this time I grew to appreciate the ""brilliant failure"" quality that bus drivers seem to have. They knew all sorts of interesting tidbits about the world, and it was usually fun to talk with them on the drive to and from school.<p>One driver in particular stands out in my mind, a man named Brian. Brian loved those morning radio stations that brought up social issues and asked listeners to comment. I liked them too. So we'd end up talking about these (in many cases esoteric) social issues and I'd present misguided positions. Which Brian would go ahead and tell me didn't make sense. It was fun. I'd always get Brian on the morning drive, rarely in the afternoon. It felt good stepping off the school bus having just had a discussion about the world. Gets you in that learning mood.<p>This situation persisted for some time. During the intervening period I related my (then) dream of becoming a video game designer and computer programmer. He thought it was funny because he wanted to get into a similar field. Eventually it was the last day of school. While I'd had a great time and knew I'd miss all the staff greatly, it didn't really hit me until I was on the bus home. By chance, that day I had Brian. As I was tearing up, conversation didn't really happen. I had finally realized that this would be the last time I would ever see Brian. It wasn't a comforting thought. Eventually it came time to step off the bus. My mom came home at the same time and got out of the car to greet me.<p>I knew it was going to sound awkward, but it had to be said, I went up to her crying and the first words out of my mouth were ""Mom, I'd like you to meet my bus driver."". It was an odd request, but she did it. In the ensuing conversation I learned that Brian's parent company was about to shutter it's doors and that he'd be out a job. His hope was to attend a trade school and become a sysadmin or some such. We exchanged contact details and he was off.<p>A month had passed. While I hadn't forgotten him (And the rest of my school experience.) he wasn't exactly the top thing on my mind. My mom walked in with a large package; addressed to me. That was a rare thing but not totally out of the question, my aunt would occasionally send me gifts in the mail. I asked if she knew what my aunt had sent. I was utterly shocked to find out that it hadn't been sent by my aunt. With a modicum of confusion an infusion of excitement and insatiable curiosity I started to tear the package open.<p>When I finally had it undone the item inside may or may not have produced tears of joy.<p>It was a copy of <i>Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner.</i> Which I guess you could say is what really got me started on the whole ""Program your computer thing."". My mom told me to pen a thank you letter to inform him that I received it. I never got around to it and I have since lost his contact details. I hope to one day track him down and give him the thanks he deserves.<p>Sure the difference in monetary expense is $60 to over 90K.

If the answer is ""nothing"" then it wasn't covered!<p>At the end of the day, an automated test suite is a product for developers on your project in the same way that a car is a product for drivers.  You will have a hard time making a car if nobody on your car-making team can drive, and you will have a hard time writing a test suite as a tool to develop Project Foo if nobody on your test-writing team develops Project Foo.<p>I now write a project where I handle both the code and the tests.  In the same way that my production code is improved by writing tests, my tests are improved by writing production code.  I know what is included in the test coverage in the same way that I know what I had for lunch today - because I was there and I remember what happened.  Tools for checking coverage are an aid to my understanding; in a company with a separate test org, you don't know anything about coverage until you've run the tool.",1334182746

I mean, how is this even a question?</i><p>Why yes, it is worse in some theoretical manner.  But if you think it is necessarily worse as a practical manner, you have failed to understand the math fully.<p>Suppose that n is 1000 in some toy problem.  Then you scale it up to a huge data set, a billion items!  The log(n) factor only got worse by a factor of 3.  Maybe we didn't go high enough.  Perhaps we can take a large data set.  Let's see, how about all of the data that is produced at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in a year?  That's 15 petabytes.  Now the log(n) factor is a whopping 5.39.<p>In other words while log(n) represents unbounded possible growth, it gets worse in practice by at most a fairly small constant factor.<p>How about O(1)?  O(1) does not mean fast.  It just means constant relative to the data size.  It can be a bad constant, but as long as it is a constant it qualifies as O(1).<p>Let's take a practical example.  Wavelets are cool in lots of ways, but one of the properties people noticed quickly is that doing a basic wavelet transform on a data set with n elements takes time O(n).  Doing a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) on the same data set takes time O(n log(n)).  Yay, we're faster!<p>But hold on a minute.  The interesting wavelets that we like to use are O(n) with a worse constant than the FFT.  So the FFT tends to be faster on practical data sets.  (There are lots of reasons why one would prefer wavelets over the FFT, but speed of calculation is not generally one of them.)",1334182467

2957876,comment,2957522,2957522,1,0,watmough,,,"Yeah, I feel like that almost all the time.<p>You have to write a LOT of code before it flows perfectly from the fingertips. That's the key, write lots of code and be aware how you can improve.<p>Here's a few points that have been useful to me:<p>1. Write code to be used. If it's not useful, why are you bothering? If it's useful, other people will use it and demand changes and complain about bugs.<p>2. Great programmers code fast. Write code quickly and refactor whenever necessary. Get miles under your wheels. Great racing drivers drive. Practice, practice, practice. ABC - Always Be Coding.<p>3. Practice refactoring. If you see a better way to do something, implement it. Don't cry that you're scared to change it because it's 'working'. ALL your code should work.<p>4. Set small targets that you can accomplish in an hour of so of designing or coding. Always have a pile of these ready to work on. Work on them when you have an hour free. Code fast, test and commit.<p>5. Use git. Commit at a fine granularity so you can see your enjoy your progress.<p>6. Always ask yourself ""Is this code clear? Do I trust it?"" when reading a source file.<p>7. Don't fight your tools. If you constantly edit auto-completed text, STOP DOING that and fix it or disable it, or learn to write idiomatic code.<p>Thanks for the question, and I hope these are useful. It's fun for me to crystallize some of this stuff!",1315076346

Then, after a few years, you'd take the schematics of those which did not crash, and repeat the process. _This_ is evolution, what you describe is rather closer to lamarckism.",1315076096

2957799,comment,2957522,2957522,5,0,steve8918,,,"First and foremost, write your code so that it can be understood easily by someone that knows nothing about it.  As you get older, you'll realize that this person is you!  Anything written over 2 weeks ago is often like looking at new code, so make sure you have good comments and non-obscure variable names so that you can understand it easily.  This also makes it easier on your coworkers.<p>Second, write for readability and maintainability.  Save optimizations for the last step.  If your code is properly modularized (but not OVERLY-modularized) then you'll be able to selectively optimize and get good performance.  As you grow as a programmer, you'll realize that having maintainable code (ie. code you can change easily with new features, or changing requirements, etc) with really good performance is far more valuable than terrible code with the fastest solution.  Well-written code that is flexible and that you can shape like putty and add features to do what you want is exactly the point of programming.<p>The one thing you don't want to do is design code and products that become unmaintainable to the point where the costs of adding features becomes a nightmare.  This is what I call coding yourself into a corner.  I worked on a project where adding a single feature had a 3 page matrix of things that might break, and would need a lot of QA effort to validate.  This is not maintainable code, and an example of where every new feature gets exponentially harder to add, which pretty much kills the product.<p>Third, I think it's great that you don't think your code is good.  This means that you care!  I would say only 40% of the coders I've come across actually cared about making their code better, or about mastering the art of programming.  Just keep on programming, have a thick-skin to code reviews (I gave a code review to a new programmer who burst into tears because she had never been code-reviewed before), and be willing to learn.  I have 15+ years of experience, and although I'm comfortable with my own style, I'm very open to criticism and always willing to learn.",1315074189

I 'd argue that those companies that are market leaders don't suffer so much from that problem (mostly) because they are able to instill a set of values and principles across their workforce and this is very hard (maybe impossible) to achieve with freelancers, who easily come and go and are probably much more emotionally detached from their current employer.<p>I actually believe in this freelancer world, but I also believe there has to be a reinvention of the way companies work in which setting the right balance between culture/brand identity and decentralization/individualism will be critical.",1315074019

You can't mix and match residences in order to maximize goodness (i.e. if Texas has high auto insurance rates, and it does, pick a lower insurance state for the drivers license; but use Texas for income tax purposes; and then use some other state for health insurance; whatever). So, you take the good with the bad (Texas pros: No state income tax, reasonable vehicle registration fees, conveniently located in the middle of the country for those times when you do have to physically be present; Texas cons: Somewhat high sales tax which can be a big problem when buying a new rig or boat for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, higher auto insurance rates than many places). Being half-in/half-out is sort of grey area...you probably won't get in trouble for it, but you may run into problems if you have any legal problems or have to file a major health insurance claim or something.

And it is a big concern.<p>My advice: Do NOT use the Selenium IDE. write your own framework, using Selenium, which isolates changes when they occur.

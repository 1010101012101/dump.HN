Along the same reasoning, the book/monitor format is not optimized for non-literate applications.<p>The demos are quite interesting. It's as if Wii controllers have become self-aware. Obviously, potential is lost when opting for physical items as opposed to holograms, but until simulating weight and feel is viable, these miniature devices do have a place in a myriad of activities.",1236930076
514621,comment,514564,514597,0,0,jdoliner,,,"I honestly can't see a way to think about computers as a natural evolution of the book format of presenting information. They use text that's true but that's pretty much where the comparison halts. Computers are capable of taking in substantially more information then they put out, with books all you can do is turn the pages and start or stop reading. Seems really different to me. Do you disagree?",1236929680

514618,comment,514564,514564,0,0,jdoliner,,,"I personally went nuts when I saw this on the front page. For a very specific reason. About a year ago I purchased a sweatshirt made by a cool little fashion company called Distilled. It had a really neat design on it that was reminiscent of electrical circuits. It also came with a little booklet explaining the origin of the design. The booklet revealed it was created not by a distilled designer but a collaborator (""partner in crime"" as they called him) by the name of Jeevan Kalanithi and the design was derived from his ""connectibles"" project. Pretty cool check it out:

She also recommends yoga balls as well.  I'll have to ask her about armchairs :)<p>Talking to your local chiropractor or ergonomics person is probably a good plan if you're going to be buying any furniture you plan to use intensively.",1236928239

If more people agree on something than the rest, it's the way it'll be done.<p>And somedays you have to tell people to suck it up. ""Oh, two spaces indentation in Python is how Google does it? Well, it's not how we're doing here"".<p>When it's allowed to break the rules? When the method you choose allows it. For example, breaking code convention is a no-no under whatever. But boost::shared_ptr? What everyone else on the team thinks? What does your ""method"" says? That performance is more important than readbility?<p>If you have a prima donna developer who doesn't accept his peer decisions, then you have a bigger problem than just silly arguments. You've built the wrong team :p<p>Smart people love being corrected, most of the time. They're in it for the learning, not to display their awesomeness.",1236928236

514608,comment,508033,513741,0,0,froo,,,"It's true, Eisner was doing the initial pixar deal but negotiations fell through several times.<p>Actually Bob Iger (Michael Eisner's successor) successfully negotiated and finalised the Pixar deal after he came to the realisation that all of the popular characters in recent memory in their theme parks were (in large) a result of Pixar's work. He came to this conclusion watching a parade while attending the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland.<p>He was more ready to do a proper deal that didn't screw over Pixar (which Eisner had gotten quite proficient at during his time). This resulted in Ed Catmull (then Pixar CEO and Pixar co-founder) becoming president of Disney Animation, John Lasseter (co-founder and director of many fine Pixar films) becoming Chief Creative Officer of Disney Animation and Steve Jobs getting a seat on the Disney Board.<p>Anyway, Eisner did nearly kill disney animation (It's not good when they're selling off equipment...) and his predecessor didn't do a very good job either when they decided to drop the use of multiplane camera's to reduce costs.<p>Also the later cel animated Disney films that people loved (beauty and the beast onwards) were helped in part by software that Pixar created (but the name of it escapes me at the moment)<p>So there you go :)",1236928086

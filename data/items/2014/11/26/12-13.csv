One of the interesting findings from the psychometrics of intelligence testing/g is that given sufficient motivation all tests are culture fair. You can work really hard to make a test that is approximately as fair to chimps as humans (Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices) or you can decide on a corpus of culturally bound knowledge and publish the requirements and given sufficient preparation time the rank ordering will be approximately the same.<p>I&#x27;m presuming you&#x27;re European as well, right? The truth is the SAT/GRE/GMAT/LSAT/MCAT are so highly g loaded that they&#x27;re good IQ tests and our school leaving/college entrance exams are a combination IQ test and conscientiousness test. There will also be small effects for pitch perception in music but seriously the poor reliability of any one SAT question is irrelevant given enough of them. In the limit statistics don&#x27;t lie. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with complex summative exams, I&#x27;ll support anything from economics quals to continental philosophy as the subject to be examined for rankings <i>because for most purposes it&#x27;s the rankings, not the substance that&#x27;s important.</i><p><i>The method used here is not entirely problem-free either but it&#x27;s a whole lot more practical than having a long string of multiple choice questions where you have a 25% chance by guessing and you get to know all the possible answers. This is not really representative of what you need in life or what you&#x27;ll encounter in later studies in College/University.</i><p>Practicality is a false idol. Higher (and lower) education is more sorting/signalling than training. This can be blatant like Iran/Japan/Korea/USA where what university you got into is much more important than what you studied or what grade you got in the end, middling like the UK where there&#x27;s a first tier (Oxbridge), a second (Russell Group) and also rans or other varieties like Germany (all universities are approximately equal, grades are approximately equivalent) or France (like Germany mostly with the grandes ecoles as very specialised high prestige schools). Some courses (ones that teach useful knowledge independent of ranking, like nursing or engineering) will have strangely higher salary averages for low prestige universities than one would expect, and the range for the comparable graduates of better universities will be oddly compressed.<p>Education is underrated, schooling the opposite.",1417006795

Some people say lines should be no longer than 78-80 characters, and you can&#x27;t reasonably enforce a rule like this without answering how &quot;wide&quot; a tab is.<p>- Alignment. The &quot;right thing to do&quot; is to indent with tabs and align with spaces, but this is difficult for some people, against the religion of others (mixing tabs and spaces!) and insufficient if you want to align text that spans different levels of indentation.

Have you ever seen ads shouting &quot;Driving an unlicensed cab is A FELONY!&quot; <i>before every piece of entertainment you consume</i>? That&#x27;s why you think &quot;most people feel&quot; this or that about copyright infringement. It has nothing to do with the actual matter or the intensity of &quot;natural feelings&quot; of Joe Average about this or that topic. After all, before Napster was sued, the overwhelming majority of any population had no qualms whatsoever about copying <i>anything</i> digital (computer programs etc), not unlike we all had no qualms about using Uber until cabbies revolted.<p>Napster/Mega/Uber/AirBnB all shared the commonality of enabling illegal practices on a scale previously deemed impossible. Whether this is a good thing or a bad one, it depends on individual categories, but there is no denying that they all share a fundamental challenge/disobedience of established laws.",1417006443

It is a coop because users own 100% of the company. We consider that it is not fair that some companies are being built and sold at great valuations without users getting a cut of of them. If WhatsApp was sold at $22bn it was not only because each of it&#x27;s 32 engineers built an incredible product, but also because the company had +450 million users.<p>And what does a data co-op mean? Well, data is a source of wealth in the same way than earth, labour or capital. It requires harvesting, securing, processing and eventually trading. This is nowadays done by big companies with or mostly without our permission. But that data is ours. It emanates from us. If we collaborate, we can build an entity that takes care of all that process. That is what TGD aims to do.<p>The very first step that we are taking tomorrow November 27th is focused on desktop browsing data, and for that we have built a Chrome extension that blocks third parties tracking you online and -if you give an additional permission- trade a small part of that data anonymously. All money earned is reinvested in TheGoodData and in charities<p>Code is open and we will open data as well in the future, so anyone can collaborate and build new features. By the way, we will reward those collaborations with a share of one sixth of revenues for the next six years after the feature has been deployed.<p>I hope it clarifies a bit what we want to do.

Particularly useful against companies, with many unsuspecting users and lots of sensitive stuff to encrypt.<p>It left behind lots of text files giving you instructions and an address you can access via Tor. When you went to that address, there was a web app to allow you to upload an encrypted file to confirm if it was Cryptolocker. If you pay the ransom, they would send their &quot;decrypter tool&quot; that had the encryption key embedded in it.<p>The real criminal breakthrough, in my opinion, is that all of these utilities worked.

Solution: call launching an experiment.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly hard to tell if something will work or not. So hard in fact, that you are better off assuming it won&#x27;t. Because that removes the expectation it has to do well, which is what&#x27;s really holding you back, not fear. You believe launching will be a success only if it yields a specific type of outcome.<p>If you call it an experiment, it will allow you to not take yourself seriously, or to turn the project into something else, and even to ditch it if you realize you find something else more interesting. Don&#x27;t let premature commitment limit your options. Just play.<p>Brian Eno might have said it best:<p><pre><code>  Artists who don&#x27;t censor their own work: Picasso, Miles\n  Davis, Prince. They&#x27;re all people who just put it out,\n  and have almost no critical self-censorship. They say,\n  &quot;Let the market decide; let the world decide.&quot; You might\n  not be the best person to judge it.\n\n  That&#x27;s a kind of humility, actually: it&#x27;s a mixture of\n  arrogance, which says, &quot;I know I&#x27;m fucking good.&quot; But a\n  humility, which says, &quot;I&#x27;m not the person to decide.&quot;</code></pre>",1417003662

Jane wants to download many files, so she signs up for a premium account.\n4. John gets a comission from MegaUpload.<p>What happens if John uploads copyrighted material and drives sales for MegaUpload using pirated software and movies? Well...the file gets removed, but nothing else. He can continue doing it again and again, even uploading the same file again.<p>And this was going on on a massive scale, hundreds of people were earning several thousand dollars per month from this and -- according to court documents -- Kim was very much aware of this and even actively encouraged uploaders to supply copyrighted material to the system.",1417003594

If the ruling had gone the other way, a lot of manufacturing would have moved out of the USA as the manufacturers would have had a lot more control over resale.<p>In summary, as long as it was manufactured legally anywhere in the world then you can damn well do with it what you like after you have bought it :)<p>What is more interesting is his comment on the “You Own Devices Act” (YODA). In the Internet of Things age, you may own the physical device but the licence to the software running on the device could be argued, is not transferrable. YODA enforces first sale rights to such devices making the software &#x27;licence&#x27; transferable as part of the sale.",1417003288

My main issues:<p>* ignoring C best practices:<p><pre><code>    /* prefix macros, please */\n    #define MIN(a, b)  ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b))\n</code></pre>\n* barely any comments<p><pre><code>    /* ME: ...so it parses a string? Doesn&#x27;t pretty\n     * much every parser? Also, no prefix again. */\n    void\n    strparse(void) {\n</code></pre>\n* Lack of overall project structure. Maybe some comments here would clear things up, but even some groupings like this would be nice:<p><pre><code>    /*************************\n     * X11 CALLBACKS GO HERE\n     *************************/\n</code></pre>\n* No tests. I think reasonable people can disagree about how testing should happen, but I&#x27;m a hard sell if you tell me your code needs absolutely no automated testing. If a new dev wants to commit a patch, how does she know her code works?<p>* Here&#x27;s a scenario broached by the README:<p><pre><code>    One  goal  of  st is to only support what is really\n    needed. When you encounter a sequence which you\n    really need, implement it.\n</code></pre>\n...my problem is that there are no instructions here nor comments in the code about how start doing that (&#x27;see commit X in the repo&#x27; would even work). Again, I would hope that a dev-oriented tool like this (editing config.mk is in the installation instructions) would be a bit more friendly to developers who are stepping into the project for the first time.<p>My concern is that the code might suck less than xterm (I&#x27;m not familiar with that code-base), but I&#x27;m not sure &quot;less cruft&quot; is a good enough reason for me to want to get involved with (or even use) a project. Of course, I&#x27;m willing for the people of suckless.org to prove me wrong in my assessment.",1417003231

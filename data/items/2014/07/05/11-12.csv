7991647,comment,7988738,7991179,2,0,pron,,,"Scala&#x27;s reduction of code size is way overrated, IMO. We&#x27;re not talking Clojure level succinctness, and you&#x27;ll be very lucky to get a 30-50% reduction (as compared to, say, Clojure&#x27;s 5x-10x). In addition, that reduction is -- as you state yourself -- mostly of boilerplate code, which is &quot;cheap&quot; and doesn&#x27;t tend to have lots of bugs. OTOH, it comes at a cost of very high language complexity, interop, and maintainability. So you pay hard currency for reduction of boilerplate (a mere annoyance).<p>I would certainly consider Kotlin, though. Kotlin reduces the boilerplate but doesn&#x27;t add much complexity, and doesn&#x27;t hurt interop in the least. So you pay cheap for the (modest) benefits. This seems like a much better deal for me.",1404561530

This requires that you pick your tools and problems. If you&#x27;re lucky enough to work in an open-allocation environment, and if that persists for 40 years, then that&#x27;s great and you&#x27;ll never be bored or frustrated.<p>However, most programmers want their work to be progressive: bigger challenges, more interesting problems, high-impact opportunities. This&#x27;ll inevitably put you on the battlefield with <i>status quo</i> rent-seekers who hate you just for improving things. Even if you&#x27;re not a threat to them in anyway, they&#x27;ll hit you preemptively, just to prove that they can.<p><i>I really don&#x27;t want to learn office politics</i><p>I understand. Who does? How many college kids say, &quot;I want to get out there and be a private-sector politician&quot;? Probably very few.<p>It&#x27;s a shitty game. It shouldn&#x27;t exist. But it does, and the only way we can hold it back is if good people are willing to join the fight, and able to win it.<p><i>what makes them my enemies? If they weren&#x27;t around I&#x27;d have to do more of that non-coding crap work</i><p>It&#x27;s not &quot;programmer good, business bad&quot;. There are good businesspeople and bad, turncoat programmers. What makes the bad guys bad is not what they do, but the mentality. The bad guys are the ones who see us as overpaid cost centers and peasantry. Decent people managers and entrepreneurs are worth their weight in gold, but very rare: maybe 10% of the tribe.<p>A good manager knows that his job is to be a &quot;sheep dog&quot;. His role is to protect the people doing the work, from assaults on all sides, so they <i>can</i> do the work. Whether it&#x27;s an executive trying to squeeze employees or a low-level employee being a toxic jerk (i.e. making sexist remarks, insulting others&#x27; work) a good manager fights that. A <i>bad</i> manager thinks that his reports exist to serve him and that it doesn&#x27;t go both ways.",1404561508

This is a feature for Go, just as dynamic typing is a feature for python.  Neither is right or wrong or backwards.  They&#x27;re different design choices.

Given the clear benefits of wealth, it&#x27;s obvious that getting rich is not easy otherwise we&#x27;d expect to see less inequality.<p>Before anybody tries to tell me that getting rich might not be important to most people, think very carefully about whether you&#x27;re qualified to comment.

They either have sufficient excess of power to maintain that army in relation to the rest of their expenses, and so lack significant threats to test their armies against and see where they could improve in a manner clear enough to overcome the political interests of those who&#x27;ve tied themselves to that particular model of military force. Or, they don&#x27;t - and the weight of funding the army drags down the education and wealth on which the creation of new technologies relies.<p>It happened to the British, it happened to the Chinese, it happened to the Russians, it happened to the Romans, it happened to the Egyptians. It&#x27;s happened to almost every empire that has at some point enjoyed a large standing force and then had the context that made it make sense change.<p>What&#x27;s important seems to be the industrial capacity to quickly create a military force, a culture that allows you to integrate the average man into the command structure, and a core of well trained professionals to head that structure.<p>But the idea that simply investing in the military will provide us with security is not one I&#x27;d subscribe to. It seems to me that, historically, they&#x27;ve been the parties to bet on only within the niche in which they evolved. Outside of that niche, it seems better to bet on the upstarts - those with a reasonable industrial capacity or the ability to acquire one, along with a desperate enough position to go for what works and sufficiently well educated people to see the next few steps.<p>I&#x27;d expect this effect only to become more pronounced as technology advances faster.<p>tl/dr: People find something that works, and stick with it until it fails - not until it becomes illogical. Funding something creates momentum for that thing in ideological and logistical terms, and military force is not entirely fungible.

The first half of the twentieth century saw the rise of black and white film media, and it is likely that the emergence of the view that dreams are black and white was connected to this change in film technology.

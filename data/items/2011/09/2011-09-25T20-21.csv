3036731,comment,3036290,3036643,6,0,kelnos,,,"If you use git, that can definitely help you.  The trick is in making small, targeted changes that do one logical 'thing', and then committing that.  Don't be afraid to make tiny commits -- often I'll make a series of 1-liners if they aren't strictly related.  Commits are very cheap in git, so don't worry about making ""too many"".<p>Then when you run into a problem, you can easily use ""git bisect"" to figure out which commit caused the problem, and if you've kept to small commits, you should hopefully be able to figure out the offending line(s) of code pretty quickly.<p>But beyond this, I think the early sign is your gut says, ""it should be so simple but I can't figure out what's wrong"".  Listen to your instinct -- it's probably right!  Don't spend another 2 hours poking at it.  That's a good time to either step away for a bit or ask someone else to look over your shoulder for a bit while you try to explain to them what's going on.",1316984299

3036728,comment,3036290,3036290,9,0,espeed,,,"He's right, the ""walking away"" trick does work wonders some time. It gets you to relax, take a step back, and see the big picture.<p>The other aspect to this is reliance on Google. This is part stood out to me...<p><pre><code>  I start to panic a little bit...I turn to google hoping
  for a quick fix and copy/paste one of my error messages
  into the search box.
</code></pre>
Unless Ruby/Rails error messages these days are completely anemic (I haven't worked with Rails in a while), then the line number and error message should provide enough clues to debug a misspelling without having to go to Google.<p>Trust your analytic abilities -- it will keep you from that ""panic"" state.<p>Instead of seeing an error and panicking, be like Stanley Moss in <i>Wag the Dog</i> -- ""This is nothing"" :) Eventually you'll get to a point like Paul Graham where debugging relaxes you:<p><pre><code>  I like debugging: it's the one time that hacking is as
  straightforward as people think it is. You have a totally
  constrained problem, and all you have to do is solve it.
  Your program is supposed to do x. Instead it does y. Where
  does it go wrong? You know you're going to win in the end.
  It's as relaxing as painting a wall.

In this case, it was a misnamed variable. It's great that that's been fixed, but it's very easy to go hurtling on into the next problem.

This is why technical people often need a business co-founder: one who understands the domain well.<p>I had a brief stint as a teacher (three years in a private school) so while my experience is not vast, I do have a sense for the teacher's point of view.<p>Teachers often do resent spending their own money on their classrooms, but it's <i>not</i> out of a sense of entitlement.  Often the budget is tight, so teachers have to buy pencils, classroom posters, etc. out of their own small paycheck.  Also, simple things like how many copies you can make are limited.<p>So imagine a software shop where each developer:<p>(1) had their bandwidth per month capped<p>(2) if they wanted an extra monitor, productivity software, or anything beyond the standard developer setup they'd likely have to pay for it themselves<p>(3) has their salary cut in half (or by two thirds)<p>So it's not a case of entitlement at all; it's a case of scarce money.<p>About teachers not wanting technology solutions: as a teacher I had very little time during the day.  There were some days where I very literally did not have five minutes to spare and had trouble finding time to go to the bathroom (other days were more sane).  My personality is one that <i>craves</i> change, but as a teacher I found that I was juggling so much work that I did not necessarily welcome changes to existing procedures.  So I think there may be some truth to this in that teachers may not have the time resources to adapt to a lot of new technology.  <i>That said</i>, target the teachers in the summer.  They've got time to make changes then.",1316983508

No user is completely isolated from implementation: take shell completions for example.  Shell completions are this nice simple interface -- push ""TAB"" and the shell will help you out if it can.  But because there is so much machinery going on in the background, a slow or unavailable NFS volume (for example) can make your completion suddenly grind to a halt, even if you don't care about that NFS volume right now.<p>What Richard is talking about in this example is having as little extraneous stuff going on as possible.  The fewer moving parts, configuration files, commands you have to run, etc. the less there is to understand, the fewer states the entire system can be in, and the fewer sub-steps there are that can go wrong.<p>The hallmark of a truly great abstraction is that it gives you the functionality you need without getting in your way, and that higher-level abstractions can be layered on top without the lower-level abstraction getting in the way.",1316983466

I never take offense to not being invited to a business event, even one held in-house, where management is looking to schmooze with potential investors, partners and clients. Management rehearses what type of interaction they're going to have, with whom, for how long and what the content of the conversation will be (or at least they should be rehearsing), and to be honest, those plans need not be shared with developers nor should developers/sales/support/operations be rubbing elbows in the same room with prospects.<p>It's a business, not an egalitarian democracy. We all know some numbnuts will get drunk and embarrass themselves and the company. It's easier to avoid the potential of that happening by restricting the invite list to only the strategically important people. As a developer, I never considered myself to be such. Also, I never invite my boss to any of my parties, so whatever.<p>As far as the marketing/biz dev/party planner people us concerned, they're a necessary evil who more often than not display asshole behavior of the kind described in the post, but as a developer you should ask yourself if your life is worth working with/for people who's great idea is a car-sharing service with the need for a VIP room.",1316982539

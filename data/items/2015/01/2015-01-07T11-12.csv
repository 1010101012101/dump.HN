Beep! (&quot;Boom!&quot;) you&#x27;re done.<p>This works at virtually any convenience store, taxi, train gate, and also at many vending machines (mostly those in train stations).<p>I think the reason Japan got this so many years ahead of USA etc is that it predates smartphones -- it originally started with (prepaid/pre-charged) cards, which have no screen or UI beyond putting them in a machine to add funds.<p>Probably the reason behind that was overwhelming use of mass transit; trains and buses provided the compelling consumer use case (not having to go to a machine, and potentially wait in line, to buy a cheap ticket), and were initially the only place the cards worked. They just expanded after that and then makin smartphones do that same job was a no brainer.<p>Sad caveat: the iPhone (which is my main phone) is the only phone anybody here that I know uses that <i>can&#x27;t</i> do this.<p>EDIT: This is not to say that Japan is a utopian vision of mobile payments, though; there were several competing systems before universal compatibility was achieved, and you still can&#x27;t buy everything with your smart(card|phone)... but they work for upwards of 90% of day-to-day shopping.",1420631657

It doesn&#x27;t help that the mainstream solvers are black-boxes packed to the brim with their own peculiar heuristics.<p>I definitely agree that it&#x27;s undersold, though.<p>Nonlinear programming I&#x27;m a bit more suspicious of, but mostly because I have a lot less experience with it.<p>Dynamic programming, on the other hand, I don&#x27;t think should be taught in the same way at all -- to me it&#x27;s something in the algorithmic toolbox, slightly less vague than &quot;divide and conquer&quot;, mostly just a way of thinking and approaching problems. It&#x27;s incredibly useful once you &quot;get it&quot;, but I don&#x27;t trust anyone who tries to systematize it by trying to reduce it all down to Markov decision processes and the Bellman equation. Maybe I can get behind someone saying &quot;Dynamic programming is upside-down memoization,&quot; though.<p>In some sense all of these should &quot;come before&quot; machine learning because they&#x27;re often used in particular machine learning algorithms.

I do worry about a trend arising from this.<p>However, like others commenting, I think in this instance it's a good thing. It wouldn't even have to be Wikipedia for this to be my opinion; we could see Facebook Zero and I would like it. My take on it is, it's better to have something with a catch than nothing at all. Think of the Space Race: should government be controlling the rockets? Should taxpayers be footing the bill for this immense research? It got us off the ground, and I would argue that's a good thing. Now there is a booming private space industry, because the initial investment, while cause for concern, got people demanding space technology.<p>If people in African and Asian nations get a taste for web services, for the spread of information, for the ease of communication the Internet can offer, I'm predicting a similar end as the Space Race: private industry will boom once the demand reaches a high enough level. While net neutrality might be at risk in the short term, the important thing is getting the ball rolling. I can't predict the future, but I can extrapolate from the past. People will be demanding this technology in developing markets, and with the Internet comes education, business, and opportunities for improving the quality of life.",1351612539

4717857,comment,4716705,4717726,4,0,swalberg,,,"One huge advantage that puppet and chef offer is abstraction from the underlying system. So if you write a configuration that says ""Apache should be running, have PHP installed, and have the following 3 virtual hosts installed"", then you don't care if you're running on Solaris, Debian, or CentOS. The manifest/recipe takes care of figuring out what the package is called and where the config files go.<p>I'm not familiar with Ansible, but Fabric seems more like SSH with a for loop. Puppet and Chef are not about automating the typing as much as they are about ensuring consistency.

Deadlines are imaginary lines in the sand, they can be moved without penalty or further aggravation if the situation warrants it.<p>YC seems to have the right idea here.<p>Plenty of people will work really hard to make their submission as good as possible and will submit the final product at the last moment.

4717822,comment,4716156,4716156,1,0,mjn,,,"Well, this is something I'm interested in.<p>AnsProlog, which is Prolog-esque syntax implemented via answer-set programming (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming</a>) is a language that's heavily derived from Prolog, and an active area of research. It's solver-based, however (roughly like a SAT solver), which comes with pros and cons.<p>I used both Prolog and AnsProlog in a project to model and query videogame mechanics. The idea is to prototype a game's core mechanics in Prolog, and then be able to both play the game and query properties of it. We use Prolog to actually run the game, and mainly ASP to perform queries (because it allows adding various constraints). Sticking to a subset it's possible to run the same code in both, with some mechanical syntax translation.<p>Possibly a somewhat esoteric example, and definitely researchy, but imo Prolog and/or ASP still have promise in a number of areas. Prolog retains some advantages over the newer ASP in that it doesn't ground out to a propositional solver, which can make it faster in some cases (especially in large domains), and can do imperative-type stuff (there are even GUI bindings), while ASP is purely a formal solver. ASP's advantage is more flexible modeling (e.g. you can have elements of constraint programming), more active research community, and cleaner semantics in some areas, e.g. circular references can be solved.<p>A few sources:<p>[1] My collaborator's blog post on that project: <a href=""http://eis-blog.ucsc.edu/2009/06/you-have-to-mine-the-ore/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eis-blog.ucsc.edu/2009/06/you-have-to-mine-the-ore/</a><p>[2] A paper on it: <a href=""http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE09/paper/viewFile/690/1061"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE09/paper/viewFi...</a><p>[3] An op-ed I once wrote, ""Why did Prolog lose steam?"" <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/prolog_lost_steam.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/prolog_lost_steam.html</a>",1351611863

No.  When you have a ton of shares and the stock is at an all-time high, and you have even more shares vesting, it makes sense to sell.  In fact, executives have very little say over when they can sell--as the ultimate insiders, they usually arrange to sell their stock months, if not years, in advance, by filing a plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1.  These plans typically say ""sell x shares whenever the stock goes above y"".  In this way, shares can be eventually sold, but not at the executive's discretion.",1351610142

Downloaded a tone generator, and found that while in the video I heard a series of clicks at 16khz and beyond, I could in fact hear 16khz if I raised and lowered the volume from nothing to loudest in the app. It sounded like a whine and much harder to hear than I expected, distinguished most easily by when it quickly went from present to not present and back. In fact, I kept going up the scale doing that, and raising the volume, and found that I was able to hear even 19 to low 20khz as a high pitched noise, very quiet even at -6db. So ... yeah, probably does me no good considering that the loudness of other pitches makes it near impossible for me to hear anything practical in those frequencies.

It&#x27;s impossible to have a 1:1 teacher to student ratio in common education. 1:1 is used sometimes in medical sciences and practical professions that require physical demonstration, at least. For common education, the results are excellent even with larger group sizes. You can judge that by just looking at the plethora of experts graduating every year from numerous professions.<p>The dialogue is a method and is used in class rooms and lectures when the students ask the teacher questions. They can also ask their peers who have better understanding of the topic.

10524273,comment,10520639,10523099,0,0,cnvogel,,,"> compression makes all parts of the music almost equally loud<p>What you are referring to is only one particular use-case for which a &quot;compressor&quot; is used during music production: Most often people apply dedicated plugins to the &quot;master&quot; mix (the final result to be put onto CD or sold as a file). These plugins will apply what&#x27;s called a &quot;multiband compressor&quot; which can reduce dynamics individually on different parts of the frequency range, and often do quite a lot more magic than what I claim to understand. -- Done excessively the result is the mentioned &quot;always one volume&quot; result of the loudness wars.<p>The compressor as a tool isn&#x27;t limited to this use-case, though. You will, for example, put it on individual instruments&#x27; track to shape the relative strength of the percussive and decaying content of an instrument, a drum or a plucked guitar for example: Typical compressor plugins have a attack-time which shape how fast the reduction of gain follows an input signal. If you have this slower than the duration of the percussive sound, the instrument will sound more &quot;agressive&quot;, instead of being leveled down, as the &quot;attack&quot; sound is increased, relative to the resonating portion. -- The end result sounds just like the exact opposite of the excessive master compression people complain about.<p>Then you will invariably have unintended peaks in a real-world recordings, and if you don&#x27;t want to level down the whole recording to account for those peaks, or manually level them down for every instance, you&#x27;ll also employ a compressor plugin on problematic tracks.<p>Then there&#x27;s the possibility to filter the part of the spectrum that will trigger the compressor (it&#x27;s &quot;sidechain&quot;) or to let a compressor be triggered by one instrument (or group of instruments) and act on the signal of another instrument (or vocals, or group of tracks): That way you increase the percieved separation of different voices in your mix, again increasing the perceived dynamics of a song.<p>So, if you really want to find music with no compression at all, you&#x27;ll likely only find classical recordings made only with one single X/Y microphone pair... :-)",1446888448

There aren&#x27;t simple standards and practices. Hacking a machine is not taught and you won&#x27;t find tutorials for it, maybe because it&#x27;s just plain outlawed.<p>Security is boring, and it&#x27;s not rewarded. There is no insurance market for software security. If you compare it with real life security, there aren&#x27;t that many people thinking about scenarios other than police forces, the FBI, insurances, and architects of buildings.<p>My opinion is that it&#x27;s a very sensitive sector because government will always try to have the monopoly on security for obvious reasons. Linus is one guy, he doesn&#x27;t have time to care. All he can do is have a sound kernel design, and that might be much enough. Maybe he can&#x27;t deal with security like the NetBSD guys do.<p>I really think security has many, many aspects, and you can&#x27;t blame one software part for it. Security is all about mitigation, which will always resides on the user and the project engineers.",1446887900

It&#x27;s not necessarily in mixed classes, this sort of thing is also possible through various side activities (clubs and school run mostly).<p>Just as an example, here is how school runs are organized in Japan: You usually do <i>not</i> see parents involved. Instead a senpai in the neighbourhood is assigned to each group of young children to lead them to school, starting at age 6. At each street corner there is an adult watching, often seniors. All this is organized through some sort of neighborhood councils. Works beautifully, gives parents more time and older children a sense of responsibility.",1446887294

Racket in part is the continuation of the R6RS &quot;batteries included&quot; philosophy, but removed from the politics of the Scheme revision process. (Another reason for the change was the emphasis on becoming a platform for language implementation that supports multiple languages, some increasingly divergent from Scheme, like Typed Racket.)",1446887059

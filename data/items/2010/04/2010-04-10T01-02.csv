For instance, Apple's choice not to display Flash on the iPhone browser was not arbitrary and meant to hurt developers, it was focused on lowering CPU usage and maintaining battery life.
Companies stay in business by understanding the needs of their customer, and if other developers/companies are casualties of that, well, hey, welcome to the free market.",1270864571

Technology always has its own limitations and parameters. It's not the first time technology has shaped the alphabet. The same story has been repeating itself since the origin of the alphabet. Greek and Latin were clearly determined by the hammer and chisel against marble - it's easier to carve straight lines in stone than rounded ones. That's why so many of our capitals are based on straight lines. The cursive Arabic was influenced by pen; cuneiform, by clay and sharp stick. Other alphabets were created by carving on bamboo. Simply today, the determining tools are fonts, computer keyboards, and satellite transmissions - the only difference being that they're a bit new and unfamiliar in the alphabet designers' hands.""",1270863812

1254329,comment,1254157,1254280,0,0,vog,,,"Pure functional programming it is not about denying time. It's about separating the computing time from the programming model's time. Or equivalently, to separate the computing order from the order of real-world events.<p>That's why monads are an extremely powerful concept, and not just a hack to ""avoid time"". Using monads, you can compose evaluations in a certain order (model time), but that doesn't automatically mean they will be actually evaluated in that order (computing time). Well, if you use IO monads this will actually be the case. But you are free to define other monads which allow you to do strange things like looking into the future or checking multiple alternatives at once.<p>Pure functional programming forces you to always make an explicit distiction between these two kinds of time, and that feels buerocratic to those who are used to confound them. However, making that distinction usually yields to much better interfaces. So there is an extra effort, but also a big gain.<p>I strongly recommend to read Philip Wadler's <i>The essence of functional programming</i> before talking undifferentiated about the broad concept of <i>time</i>:

There are an infinite number of integers, not 2^64 of them.  Etc.<p>It doesn't make much sense to structure functionality around these flawed assumptions unless you are absolutely sure your application's functionality is a subset of the computer's functionality.  Since most iPhone applications let you do much more than just add numbers modulo 2^32, it makes sense that it should be built in terms of higher-level abstractions.  Who cares if your app isn't ""coded for the underlying machine"".  It works, and it's easy to add new features without breaking everything else!<p>(Some C-level abstractions are quite good, of course, like the function call stack.  But a Scheme-like call <i>graph</i> is even more natural.)<p>The goal in creating software is for your program text to describe the solution to your problem.  It's easier to do this in the ""problem domain"" instead of ""C"", so we have created abstractions that allow us to think at the high-level of ""problem"" instead of the low-level of ""electrons being pushed around through semiconductors"".<p>Anyway, if you want to use an unpopular language so you can think you're better than everyone else, why not use Haskell instead?  At least that way you get type safety, fast automatic memory management, composable libraries, interactive development, portability, and a friendly irc channel to hang out on.<p>Oh yeah, because you're a luddite, not a programmer.

1254314,comment,1253783,1254257,0,0,pavs,,,"Thanks for the tips. Most of these I am already aware of. You are very much right about reducing the number of requests to bare minimum. I was able to cut down from 28 to 12, but the last few are tricky because some connections are external files (ads, analytics, disqus). Also I don't think its as much as the number of the connection thats the problem but the number of DNS lookup that will cause more delay. So if you have 12 file thats spread around 3 different locations, its better than having 5 files spread around 5 different locations.<p>Concatenate is also a good idea, but in some cases it breaks some JavaScripts for me.<p>Personally I am happy with ~2s avg load time, just trying to see how far I can push that number.",1270861268

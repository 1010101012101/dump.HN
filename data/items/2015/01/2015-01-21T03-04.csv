8921373,comment,8920070,8921203,0,0,brc,,,"I think the best frame of reference is to look at colonisation by British in comparison to other countries.  The difference is that the British tended to leave behind a system of governance wbased on English common law, which stretches back a millennia.  That also leads to functioning institutions.<p>So while some see colonisation as exploitation - certainly by the standards of today it is unthinkable - in other cases you can see the bequeathed laws and institutions have made up for that over time, leaving those countries able to stand on their own feet.  The peaceful transitions are by design with the promotion of the rule of law and creation of Houses of Parliament and courts and separated church, government and armed forces.<p>Interestingly the school of thought I have read says that the commonwealth independent model has everything to do with American independence - better to have a stake in something than lose everything.",1421812711

8921331,comment,8920638,8920887,0,0,Chinjut,,,"p-adic numbers are actually quite simple; so simple, I&#x27;ve actually seen children invent it on their own!! They&#x27;re just like ordinary decimal notation numbers, except instead of allowing these to extend infinitely to the right (as in 3.14159...), you allow them to extend infinitely to the left. So, in addition to familiar numbers like 45 or 67.8, you also have numbers like ...95141.3 or ...999 or what have you.<p>You add and multiply these according to the same rules you&#x27;re already familiar with. So, for example, if you add 1 to ...999, the last digit of the output is 0, and you get a carry. Making the second to last digit 0, with another carry. And so on and so on, making the result ...0000 over all. Thus, ...999 acts like -1.<p>(If we were working in base two, this last example would be just like the &quot;two&#x27;s complement&quot; you are perhaps familiar with from computer arithmetic!)<p>In fact, most discussion of p-adic numbers isn&#x27;t done in base ten. Instead, people typically focus on p-adics in a prime base (hence the p). Why? Because in a prime base, you will find that every nonzero p-adic number has a multiplicative inverse, which is very convenient (while in a composite base, you will find that sometimes nonzero numbers multiply to zero). But there&#x27;s nothing actually stopping you from making use of the notion for non-prime base, should you be interested in doing so; the notion is still perfectly coherent. (That having been said, another reason mathematicians focus on p-adics in prime bases is that the Chinese Remainder Theorem essentially allows one to reduce the study of all other bases to this case.)<p>There&#x27;s a lot of beautiful further theory to explore here, but again, the basic idea is hopefully quite simple. Let me know if you have any questions and I&#x27;ll be happy to try explaining further or more clearly.",1421811878

The more relevant factor would be having chosen the correct side.<p>> My sense is that rather than courageous, it is extremely easy to take sides like opposing torture in all forms at all times. Such positions receive automatic praise and require little complex thinking. That does not necessarily make them wrong, but we should subject them to an extra shade of rational skepticism.<p>I don&#x27;t think the amount of effort or risk involved in reaching a moral decision can be considered an indicator of that decision&#x27;s correctness. We would not consider someone who took one second to decide to help an old lady across the street to have acted more morally than someone who had to take a little more thought to make the decision based on the same reasoning, after all. And plenty of decisions to choose ethical conduct over unethical conduct are quite easy for most of us to make - you can think of your own examples.

8921295,comment,8906331,8915672,0,0,raiph,,,"Yes, that works in Perl 6 too.<p>So, to recap:<p>> Can one even use CPAN with Perl6?<p>Yes.<p>A Perl 5 coder might write:<p><pre><code>    use Data::Dumper;
    print Data::Dumper->Dump([1]);
</code></pre>
A Perl 6 coder can now use the same Perl 5 module, eg:<p><pre><code>    use Data::Dumper:from<Perl5>;
    print Data::Dumper.Dump([1]);
</code></pre>
The Perl 6 &quot;adverbial phrase&quot; `:from<Perl5>` at the end of the `use` statement line tells Perl 6 what module loader to use.<p>(Another important `from` option in Perl 6 that&#x27;s currently being brought up to production grade is `:from<Java>`.)<p>The `.` rather than a `->` in the print statement line is another giveaway that this is Perl 6 code. And the `[1]`; is that a Perl 5 or a Perl 6 array literal? It doesn&#x27;t matter. This line is a taste of how slick Perl 6 interop magic is. You barely notice it, but the language is automatically marshaling data and objects back and forth between languages as necessary.<p>Of course, the above is a trivial example. But that&#x27;s not because complex examples don&#x27;t work; within a few weeks of starting Inline::Perl5 its author Stefan Seifert was demoing a Catalyst app written in Perl 6. That needed fancy stuff beyond mere passing objects back and forth; in this case Perl 6 code had to <i>subclass</i> a class from another language, in this case Perl 5, and have Perl 5 accept objects made with the subclass as if they were Perl 5 objects made from a Perl 5 subclass.<p>Inline::Perl5 hasn&#x27;t yet been smoke tested with all 130,000 CPAN modules, and it will no doubt fail with a few, and a similar story applies for the even more immature support for calling Java libs, but this tech ought to be a game changer, at least within the Perl community.<p>> Is it even possible to convert existing Perl5 CPAN packages?<p>There&#x27;s no need. (See previous point.)<p>But if you really want to, then yes it is possible, and seems to be enjoyable. Reports I&#x27;ve read of P5-to-P6 conversion stories tend to express satisfaction that basic syntax is generally the same, the changes that are necessary make sense, and the final code is a lot shorter, often half the length, and is very readable.<p>It&#x27;s not all roses with Perl 6. There&#x27;s plenty to bitch about. (#1 is still speed.) But use of CPAN modules, and  writing Perl 6 code alongside Perl 5 code, are quickly shifting over to the strengths column for Perl 6, not the weakness one.",1421811000

The purpose of a type system in my mind is to prevent bad programs from being written.  But when you combine subtyping with generics you get a problem.  Nothing keeps you from looking for an Employee in a Set<Int> because both Employee and Int are a subtype of Object and the covariant use of Set<Int> can be promoted to Set<Object>.  But that&#x27;s a nonsensical thing to do and should obviously be a type error.  This kind of thing comes up a lot in practice and is a place where Haskell&#x27;s type system is safer.",1421810138

He just couldn&#x27;t disconnect himself from his patients sickness and that was causing him depression. Long term, he just couldn&#x27;t see himself around sick people without becoming mental nut-case himself. He was very interested in Technology but couldn&#x27;t see himself starting from entry level. He decided to go for MBA at a top 5 school. It seems not many medical doctors apply for MBA so it was easy for him to get admission. After MBA, he initially worked in healthcare technology consulting. He found his medical degree, Dr before his name and MD and MBA after his name very valuable since then in his career. Today, he leads healthcare technology practice for a major technology service provider and responsible for over billion dollar in revenue and P&L for his division.<p>[2] My eye doctor has graduate Electrical Engineering degree and worked for about ten years in development with SoCal defense contractors and NorCal technology companies before quitting to go to medical school. He is now a successful Eye Surgeon. While working in technology, he didn&#x27;t like the politics of the workplace and overall work environment and expectations of technology companies. He has been very happy since becoming Eye Doctor and enjoys working with his patients. He still gets his technology fix by getting involved in medical technology innovations. He says his EE + Medicine qualifications makes him quite a desirable person in medical device industry.<p>It might take you a decade in technology to even get to the level of starting salaries of medical doctors. If you have high medical school debt, you may want to consider this in your decision to switch career.<p>You may benefit from your medicine background in a &quot;relevant&quot; technology company if you slide into the company at mid-level where you medical background is valued. Entry-level developer or IT person may not offer you any extra credit for being a medical doctor. Also in a non-medical technology company, you may be at a disadvantage compared to a person with CS degree with promotions and being taken seriously.<p>Unless you are interested in going to Business School, personally I will not recommend switching field from medicine to technology. You can always continue as medical physician while being involved with technology on the side.",1421809664

If you only use rules that match URIs instead and not element ids, ABP is extremely efficient.<p>It&#x27;s worth remembering that ABP only implemented the element-hiding feature so that things like inline text ads could be blocked, but now the popular rule lists are using a large number of broad rules to hide all kinds of elements, many of which could probably have been effectively blocked with URI-matching rules.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s very unfair to the ABP devs to be criticizing the performance or memory usage of ABP when the problem is really the memory usage of EasyList. Using a more restrained and targeted rule list makes the problems go away.",1421809531

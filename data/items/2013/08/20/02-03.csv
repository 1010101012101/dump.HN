It&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s a warrantless search, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m saying that&#x27;s an illegitimate concern. However:<p>The police already have broad authority to search you and your immediate person incident to an arrest. If this is news to you, you <i>really</i> want to read up on it. This is one of the big things that makes a formal arrest different from mere detention, and one of the reasons the ACLU guides and things like that instruct you to clearly ask if you&#x27;re &quot;under arrest&quot;.<p>All the DoJ is saying here is that a cellphone is, like your pockets and your bags, a legitimate target of a search incident to arrest. There&#x27;s apparently a circuit split on the issue. There are other things that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> legit incident to arrest; for instance, certain kinds of car searches aren&#x27;t lawful solely because of arrest (trunks can be searched if cars are impounded, but only for &quot;inventory&quot;, and can&#x27;t be searched IIRC if the car isn&#x27;t impounded; similarly, being arrested outside won&#x27;t give the police the automatic authority to search your house).",1376967163

It short circuits the entire conversation.<p>In any case, I find it odd that you find my reference of the Smart &quot;humorous&quot;. While the IIHS held their results as demonstrating bigger versus smaller, in actual reality it primarily demonstrated <i>more expensive versus less expensive</i> -- there is no great confusion that less expensive cars often sacrificed safety, and this was true at all vehicle sizes (e.g. some early budget Kia minivans and SUVs were deathtraps). It seems to have mostly passed now that even economical cars like the Cruze are posting stellar results.<p>But let&#x27;s assume that a greater weight, by itself, equals better safety. So would that Volvo do better than the Tesla if they filled the trunk full of concrete blocks?<p>Note that I didn&#x27;t say that weight doesn&#x27;t correlate with safety, but that it doesn&#x27;t correlate nearly as strongly as you seem to imply -- e.g. saying that a large sedan is 1000lbs heavier than another large sedan in no way, I would guess, leads to a conclusion that it will also do better in safety tests.",1376967119

At least in the perspective of crash tests.<p>In a crash test against a wall (equal amount of kinetic energy transferred to the wall and to the vehicle), a lightweight vehicle does better than an otherwise identical but heavier vehicle. This is because its mass is less, therefore there is less kinetic energy to dissipate.<p>However in road crashes, heavy vehicles fare better because the heavy vehicle transfers more kinetic energy to the more lightweight vehicle.<p>NHTSA crash ratings are well known to not reflect this difference. But the point remain that heavy vehicles are disadvantaged compared to lightweight vehicle, and the fact the Model S does so well despite its weight is a testament to its good crash resistance.",1376967117

For example, the Penn crowd often uses the word &#x27;contract&#x27; in relation to refinement typing. The Scheme folks tend to think of the problem in different terms, but I am not convinced there is any substantial or insightful difference between the various definitions. As you seem to be an expert in the subject, I am sure you have read the manifest contracts paper, but I will leave this link here for the others: <a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mgree/papers/popl2010_contracts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mgree/papers/popl2010_contracts.pd...</a>.<p>- I have never heard anyone say that types cannot feature blame. I would argue that, for example, Haskell&#x27;s type checker is quite good at blaming the correct party for a type violation. To argue the opposite you would need a precise definition of blame, and I am aware there are several papers written on this subject. I am sure you could find a definition of blame that excludes static type systems, but I am not sure that definition would be useful.<p>- Types are not proofs, but typing derivations are. Even if you consider types and contracts to be different, the execution trace serves as a proof of a dynamically checked &#x27;contract&#x27; (which is really just a derivation in an operational semantics).",1376966910

The Windows version of Node performs a lot better if you have it use Microsoft&#x27;s kernel mode HTTP interfaces than if you use the crazy micro-optimized HTTP support in Node that is responsible for this bug.<p>Ultimately, the prologue in a HTTP request - &#x27;HTTP/1.1 GET&#x27; or whatever - is a tiny string of bytes and parsing it, even using the most slow language on the planet, really isn&#x27;t that expensive.

These \n  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests are about the \n  physics of car crashes, which dictate that very small cars \n  generally can&#x27;t protect people in crashes as well as \n  bigger, heavier models.\n\n  &quot;There are good reasons people buy minicars,&quot; says \n  Institute president Adrian Lund. &quot;They&#x27;re more affordable, \n  and they use less gas. But the safety trade-offs are clear \n  from our new tests. Equally clear are the implications when \n  it comes to fuel economy. If automakers downsize cars so \n  their fleets use less fuel, occupant safety will be \n  compromised. However, there are ways to serve fuel economy \n  and safety at the same time.&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/808569.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/808569.pdf</a><p><pre><code>  Large vehicles have historically been more stable and \n  provided more protection for their own\n  occupants than small ones, but they presented a greater \n  hazard to other road users.

Since the major \n  downsizing of passenger cars during 1975-82,\n  light trucks have had a substantial and growing weight \n  advantage over cars. By 1992, the number\n  of fatalities in collisions between cars and light trucks \n  exceeded the number in car-to-car collisions\n  In car-light truck collisions, 80 percent of the fatalities \n  are occupants of the cars. That raises the\n  question whether the growth in the number and weight of \n  light trucks is having an adverse impact\n  on the safety of passenger car occupants and other road \n  users, possibly exceeding any safety benefits\n  of the vehicle-weight increases for the occupants of the \n  trucks.\n</code></pre>\nVehicle safety is complicated, obviously, and vehicle weight isn&#x27;t the only variable of merit, obviously.

The Scouts are a great organization <i>on a local level</i>, where there&#x27;s little bureaucracy, and most decisions are made by or with the boys. You gain a good sense of responsibility when you&#x27;re the one in charge of overseeing all the camping gear for your trip, or planning an outing over a weekend. There&#x27;s also a lot to be said for the personal growth that comes from starting as a ten-year-old, learning from the older boys, and then realizing at age eighteen that you&#x27;re one of those older boys who is looked up to by the young ones.<p>However, the BSA at a <i>national</i> level is a pretty awful organization.

6241261,comment,6240151,6241135,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">This works only if the electorate allows their votes to be bought.<p>The electorate doesn&#x27;t receive anything for their votes. What they receive is entertainment in exchange for their attention. Their attention is then sold to the highest bidder, i.e. the politicians with the most money.<p>>The notion that a third party vote is &#x27;wasted&#x27; is false. Even in a two-party system, it&#x27;s an irrefutable signal to the dominant parties that available votes are being left on the table.<p>You have two problems here. The first problem is that the votes aren&#x27;t actually on the table. If you vote for the Green party, the Democrats can&#x27;t move to the left and end up with a net increase in votes because if they move to the left they may pick up a four Green voters and lose six centrist voters. What putting a viable Green candidate on the ballot does is require the Democrat to move toward the right because they&#x27;ll have to capture more of the middle in order to defeat the Republican. It also allows the Republican candidate to move even further to the right at a given level of risk of losing to the Democrat. (And obviously vice versa if the viable third party candidate is an arch conservative.)<p>The second problem is that the third party candidates know this, so anyone you would actually want in office and who has any realistic chance of being elected just runs on the major party ticket of the party most aligned with their views. So you don&#x27;t actually have any good third party candidates to vote for, because anyone who satisfies the criteria of being plausibly electable is just going to run on a major party ticket. Feel free to trot out a few count-on-one-hand counterexamples, but your average House race doesn&#x27;t exactly have a plethora of desirable third party alternatives.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again: If you want to vote where it counts, vote (or run) in the primaries for the major parties.",1376964617

Leaving the units out of your physics math is like, well, not wearing a seat belt when driving a car.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m afraid that 0.5 seconds to come to rest is way too long. Toss it into the equations of motion and:<p><pre><code>    d = 1/2 at^2\n    d = 1/2 9.8m/s^2 (0.5s)^2\n    d = 4.9m\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, decelerating at 4 gees for half a second means you decelerate over nearly five meters.<p>I think we&#x27;re better off starting at the other end of the stick and making a wild guess that the roof can move 10cm without being permanently deformed. Then:<p><pre><code>    d = 1/2 at^2\n    0.1m = 1/2 4 * 9.8m/s^2 t^2\n    t = 0.0714s\n</code></pre>\nTo figure out the height, we can notice that a and t will be inversely proportional for any given velocity (double the time, halve the acceleration needed), and so, for a given initial or final velocity, the subexpression at^2 is directly proportional to the change in acceleration. In other words, if we assume that the roof can withstand 10cm of deflection, you can drop the car from 40cm up.",1376964517

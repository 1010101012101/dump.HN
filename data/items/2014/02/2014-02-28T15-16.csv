7319461,comment,7318892,7319300,2,0,malaporte,,,"Hmm technically you don&#x27;t need an IDE to make good use of Typescript. It works very well as a standalone compiler installed using npm, and you get static type checking etc. which is really the point of Typescript IMHO --- if you don&#x27;t care for static typing you might as well use JS directly.<p>Sure, once you&#x27;ve got this you might as well want good auto-completion, refactorings, etc, but this also applies to any language that&#x27;s not bound to one specific IDE (C++, for example, or Java).",1393603181

It works both ways, though.<p>While some may call me hypocritical for accepting a write-off that I oppose, at the same time I pay the taxes that I disagree with.  This makes me (and Musk) law abiding.<p>The government has loans for certain types of activity.  He took the loans because they were the lowest cost for the capital.  It is possible to take those loans and be against them at the same time.<p>The real problem is that the government is giving out loans that are practically unsecured, usually to connected individuals.  Musk actually has a car company producing cars.  Yes, he could have sought private financing, but the government underbid that financing and he took government loans.  It&#x27;s hardly rent seeking.",1393603177

That is one of the main reasons that giving a lecture is tiring - it&#x27;s work to be &quot;on&quot; for over an hour.<p>The other main mental work is, as you said, devising strategies for explaining material to students who don&#x27;t understand it the first time. It requires patience and self-control (if you betray any sense of frustration, you will lose them) on top of the difficult task of figuring out what their exact misunderstanding is.<p>And I agree, it&#x27;s harder to do the more basic the material gets. Explaining advanced systems concepts to computer science juniors was much, much easier than explaining basic programming concepts to people with no prior programming experience.

There are many aspects of living within one&#x27;s means that are out of the control of the individual.<p>For example, if a young person retired 20 years ago, he probably would have done a poor job budgeting for increases in prices for healthcare, especially given what the individual market looks these days. If, after a twenty year absence from the workforce, he is forced to work again, he will rapidly be approaching traditional retirement age with a large gap in work history and limited career options.<p>Maybe working or volunteering on the side can keep his skills sharp, but how easy will it be to convince potential employers of that fact?<p>It&#x27;s possible that people are saying &quot;retirement&quot; when they mean &quot;frequent sabbaticals&quot;, in which case, some better labeling of that lifestyle choice would clear up my confusion.

7319423,comment,7318544,7318544,12,0,jnbiche,,,"Every time I think about what Android <i>could</i> have been, my frustration mounts.  Google chose to use Java for the top layer on top of their native code libraries (as in on top of C libraries like surface manager, opengles, openvg, sgl, etc.).  Why they chose Java instead of a language that integrates well with C, I just don&#x27;t understand.  It would have made the ecosystem much more open.<p>I wish they had considered just making the top layer in Luajit, as well as exposing a C API.  Luajit would have been just as efficient battery-wise as Dalvik, and perhaps even better-performing.  Best of all, people then could have much more easily built libraries for Python, Ruby, and any other language with good C interop.<p>Instead, we&#x27;re left with Java.  It&#x27;s not a bad language, but it is very bad at integrating with other languages and platforms.<p>I prefer Android to iOS, but the iOS architecture is definitely more open to third-party platforms.

That return will be split between capital gain and rent.  Rent no longer covers the mortgage because it is the total return that determines if it is a good investment.  There are also the tax benefits of renting out a house in some locations (maintenance and insurance would be deductible).<p>When we rented out our house, we were told that the typical return on capital was 8%, where 2-3% would be capital gain, and the rest in rent.  We priced our rent at 5% to get a quick rental.  Mortgage rates in that location are 6%.<p>If it is hard to gather a down payment, then rents can exceed mortgages because renters cannot easily swap between the two.",1393601936

But I rarely heard her talk about the pure joy of teaching, at least compared to the difficulties of dealing with the management (the principal) and other logistics issues...such as having to pay for her own classroom supplies, including books that she wanted if they weren&#x27;t on the state-wide curriculum, and pencil and paper for her poorer students.<p>Her complaints about office politics were what really surprised me. Even though I know every bureaucracy is universally crushing (well, maybe I grok better now after watching The Wire), it just seems that being a great, passionate teacher, supersedes any kind of office bullshit...such as the way principal communicates with you. But then again, if you can&#x27;t get along with the person who runs the place, and you&#x27;re put in a shitty classroom and have to share a teacher&#x27;s officespace with 3 other novices...how could that <i>not</i> affect your teaching performance and job satisfaction?<p>One memory I still have from high school was one afternoon when I had to stay after school to give a presentation to the teachers on their regular Thursday-school-wide meeting. The meeting was in the cafeteria...and you know how lunch tables reflect a sort of social-hierarchy among kids? It was no different for the teachers...and even more surprising, the social lines seemed to fall along with how I, as a student, expected them to (attractive young teachers sat with the other young teachers; cool popular teachers could sit anywhere they want; the weird chemistry teacher sat in the corner). I mean, it&#x27;s one thing to have perceptions as a kid, but I <i>knew</i> I was a petty kid...so it was a surprise to see that things were not much different in the adult world.",1393601899

As backbone increases, there&#x27;s no reason for Comcast/TW Cable/RCN/etc. to increase the data tiers/lower cost per Mbps, so I believe you&#x27;d see costs creep upwards as data consumption grows.",1393601555

If you work in Denmark 40 years, you&#x27;re entitled to a full state pension. If you work 20, you&#x27;re entitled to half of one. If you work 4, you&#x27;re entitled to 10%. You don&#x27;t get it solely by citizenship. There is some basic welfare support for those who live in the country, though, e.g. if you&#x27;re a Danish citizen who lived abroad and ends up back in Denmark dirt poor aged 70 and lacking a pension from elsewhere to support yourself, you won&#x27;t be on the street.

7319023,comment,7317254,7318262,1,0,tel,,,"I can clarify this. The thing I outline below is a little situation dependent (and matching this hypothetical) but the intuition is generally correct and amenable with yours.<p>One way to see all the pieces is to recognize that at least in theory there are real answers to all of these questions which we are approximating. We could literally round up every &quot;programmer&quot; and ask them whether or not they &quot;like science&quot; and then get a completely accurate statistic that, say, &quot;92% of programmers like science&quot;.<p>But that&#x27;s infeasible (even buying that my quoted words could make literal sense) so instead we run a finite study. This is called taking the subpopulation of a superpopulation and drawing the statistic from that subpopulation. Now we see that in our subpopulation of N participant-programmers, 80% of them liked science.<p>Now let&#x27;s bring in a new guy. Let&#x27;s say we brought him in by taking every programmer in the superpopulation (replacing our sampled subpopulation back into the global pool) and picking one guy in a lottery. Provided that was a truly random lottery then we can use the 92% number from before and know that there&#x27;s a 92% chance that our lottery picked a science-liker.<p>But we don&#x27;t actually have that information. Instead, we simply have an estimate to 92%, our subpopulation statistic of 80%. If our error bars on guessing incorrectly are fine with a 12% discrepancy then we&#x27;re still golden, though.<p>But there&#x27;s one final element—we want to be able to talk about our sampling process and the risks of using it. The only parameter of this process is the size of the subpopulation chosen. For instance, if we had sampled only 5 people then there&#x27;s about a 1/4 chance that we&#x27;d arrive at an estimate of 80% and a 7/10 chance we&#x27;d get 100%. This still leaves around 10% of the possible subpopulations we could choose that would tell us something really misleading, like only 20% of programmers like science.<p>This could be called sample statistic stability, or just straight up estimation error. It&#x27;s rarely taken into account when people say things like &quot;80% of programmers like science&quot; because the usual assumption is that the sampled subpopulation is &quot;big enough&quot; to minimize this error sufficiently. In truth, though, it&#x27;s hard to know exactly what the possible error of your sampling method really is.<p>So finally, we want to know that, given we saw 80% of our subpopulation likes science, what&#x27;s the chance that a new, randomly drawn programmer also likes science. The honest truth is that there&#x27;s a 92% chance, so we&#x27;re ignoring some amount of error by taking our study on faith and saying that there&#x27;s an 80% chance. However, given literally no other information, it&#x27;s still our best bet to assume there&#x27;s an 80% chance—it&#x27;s better than randomly picking any other number based on the data we&#x27;ve seen. [0] Finally, if we were to repeat this whole experience over and over again starting with fresh, random draws of the subpopulation then we&#x27;d be, on average, correct in our guesses about the ratio of the super population [1].<p>[0] Bayesians here would say that we should mix in other information we might have to form a better estimate—I think that makes a lot of sense in a situation like this, especially if our subpopulation is tiny, so I&#x27;m trying to be really clear that we have no other information. Let&#x27;s not talk non-informative priors.<p>[1] i.e. if we keep repeatedly re-estimating our &quot;80% statistic&quot; and using it honestly to make our guesses then it would bounce around based on our subpopulation, sometimes 80%, sometimes 100%, sometimes 20%, etc. If we multiply these estimates by how often they occur and sum it all up then we&#x27;ll get exactly 92%. We&#x27;d get there faster just by drawing a bigger subpopulation, though.",1393599938

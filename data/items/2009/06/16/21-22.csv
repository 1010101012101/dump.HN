Moral relativism -- the idea that everything is just about the same, depending on how you look at it --as a popular meme is very recent in the historical record.<p>Look. It's lazy thinking, that's all. I'm sorry to have to say that. Critical thinking requires of you to make moral choices. So make some. I've made mine in the matter. Nobody is saying your thinking skills or any better or any worse than anybody else. I'm just asking you to use them.<p>If you're still having problems, try a little Kant: only do those things that you would want the rest of the world to do. If your code says it's okay to attack sites because you ""think you are in the right"", whatever <i>that</i> means, then you should expect everybody to do that. If your code involves other things, then formulate your rules and stick to them. But don't sit around saying it's just all kind of the same. That's the starting point: without your brain analyzing it, yes, it's all kind of the same. But that's why you have a brain; its to tell the difference.<p>Look I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings or was rude or something. I really am. But there's an important point here.

I do really like the superset syntax approach where css is legal syntax in a less file.<p>So I will be following along the development. There's still a lot of features that would be required of less to support a framework like compass. There's currently no arguments for mixins, no way to extend the language with functions that call out to code, no macro syntax allowing branching/looping and generation of selectors and properties. Such features aren't needed by your average user writing their own content, but they are absolutely core to building reusable design that can be configured and applied to your code using a simple and intuitive interface.<p>Anyways, it's really great to see new ideas and innovation in the css compiler space.

660938,comment,660720,660720,0,0,Maro,,,"When I did the Ironman last year, I told <i>everyone</i> about it: friends, family and co-workers. I did it on purpose. It was a risk I took, because would I have failed to prepare for the race or finish the race, everyone would have thought I'm a ""looser"" or ""quitter"". I used this fear as additional motivational fuel. Also, to my surprise, most people told me I'm an idiot for even attempting an Ironman and that I wouldn't be able to finish it. (Lesson learned: Culturally, here in Eastern Europe 'we' don't have the 'can do' attitude.) That was another huge boost, showing these people how limited their mindset is. It's kind of cheating, because you're using external factors to motivate you, but you need all the ""help""  to do extraordinary things.<p>Think of Ali when he was preparing for the Foreman fight --- he used an entire nation to motivate him for the Rumble in the Jungle. Whenever he got a chance, he went on TV and said he would destroy Foreman. He absolutely commited himself in front of the entire world and it worked for him. Foreman, on the other hand, was different, he was more introverted, and although he lost that fight, he was still a great boxer.<p>So, on a personal level, I strongly disagree with this article. I'd rather strive to be like Ali than accept some mediocre average.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5o-yxwBJuk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5o-yxwBJuk</a>",1245188174

How do you identify such use when I'm driving alone, which is the majority of my driving?<p>You can argue that they don't ""need"" a large vehicle to do their kiddie runs.  (I certainly don't know why taking a couple of kids requires more equipment than invading France.)  You could also argue that they should rent for fairly rare ""very heavy"" tasks and buy a little smaller.

She railed against its claims that a chemical remedy could be diluted to the point where a sample was unlikely to contain a single molecule of anything but water, and yet still have a healing effect. Until, that is, she set out to prove once and for all that homeopathy was bunkum.<p>In her most recent paper, Ennis describes how her team looked at the effects of ultra-dilute solutions of histamine on human white blood cells involved in inflammation. These ""basophils"" release histamine when the cells are under attack. Once released, the histamine stops them releasing any more. The study, replicated in four different labs, found that homeopathic solutions - so dilute that they probably didn't contain a single histamine molecule - worked just like histamine. Ennis might not be happy with the homeopaths' claims, but she admits that an effect cannot be ruled out.<p>So how could it happen? Homeopaths prepare their remedies by dissolving things like charcoal, deadly nightshade or spider venom in ethanol, and then diluting this ""mother tincture"" in water again and again. No matter what the level of dilution, homeopaths claim, the original remedy leaves some kind of imprint on the water molecules. Thus, however dilute the solution becomes, it is still imbued with the properties of the remedy.<p>You can understand why Ennis remains sceptical. And it remains true that no homeopathic remedy has ever been shown to work in a large randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial. But the Belfast study (Inflammation Research, vol 53, p 181) suggests that something is going on. ""We are,"" Ennis says in her paper, ""unable to explain our findings and are reporting them to encourage others to investigate this phenomenon."" If the results turn out to be real, she says, the implications are profound: we may have to rewrite physics and chemistry.",1245186529

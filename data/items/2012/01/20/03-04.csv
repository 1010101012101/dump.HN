So we have to ask ourselves, why are they doing that? It's because when these cases actually go to Court, they don't always win. In fact in a lot of the cases they lose.<p>This is why they've been trying to switch their strategy from fighting the ""pirate sites"" in Court, and instead just try to get Congress to pass a law that helps them bypass the courts completely and give them a kill-switch for all the sites they don't like. Their strategy with these bills has been ""shoot first, and hopefully you don't ask any questions later and take us to Court"".<p>So before anything, this is what we really need to focus on and fight against - them wanting to remove full due process.

3488208,comment,3482507,3488052,1,0,kls,,,"I think you paint a skewed version of history, slavery was alive and well in England until 1772 with the James Somersett's decision. We can argue over the semantics as to whether a serf is a slave by legal letter, but for most it is commonly accepted that the institution of slavery existed in England until 1772. It also existed in many colonies that existed under many structures of rule. It's existence, in England can be traced to Rome (it actually existed in a form even before Roman occupation), who can trace it to Greece who can trace it to Egypt who can trace it to Mesopotamia. In each of those empires, the rights of slaves ebbed and flowed just as today the rights of citizens ebb and flow. In England slaves had some rights, in the US they had less, in Haiti under the French even less, but it was all slavery and they can all trace their roots back to Rome and as such back to Mesopotamia. But to argue that what England had was not slavery in comparison to the US is akin to arguing what the US had was not slavery in comparison to Haiti. The reality is very different though, they where all indentured, and deprived of rights, to most that classifies as slavery. Roman slavery was also instrumental in shaping the western views on slavery (which was a pretty brutal view).<p>The republic is no more or less responsible for slavery than any other form of government, with maybe the exception of Fascism. Abolitionism and industrialization can take far more credit for the elimination of slavery than the structuring of a government. The fact that slavery was not abolished in Norther states until 4 years after the war started lends credence to the fact that the institution of slavery fared no better due to a strong central government in DC, what ended slavery was a combination of changing cultural norms (the abolitionist possessing the stronger moral argument) and Industrialization requiring the need for skilled and educated workers. These are the constructs that ended slavery not a strong central government. Hitler had a strong central government, and it could be argued that he enslaved millions. It is not the system of government but rather the morals and virtue of the culture.<p><i>in both cases the better side won</i><p>Yes in much the same way the better side won in the Iraqi war. Some good will come of it and some bad will as well. But with conflict there are always a host of agendas at play, boiling war down to ""liberating the Iraqi people"" does us a disservice and makes us far more susceptible to repeating past mistakes, because every war that has ever been fought has been justified by a moral cause. But morality does not emerge from acts of immorality. It emerges from the enlightenment of moral people such as the abolitionist, or Dr. King or Gandhi.<p>War is never morally virtuous, it is men killing men and usually for resources or power, forgetting that, allows us to succumb to moral propaganda, when we need to be vanguards of peace.",1327030975

Otherwise it was unfair and thats the purpose why safe harbour exist -- it protects you a small company from millions of users uploading their content and being shorthand or not having boots to check each and single file whether it violates someones copyrights or not.<p>> Consider this totally legal (for me) scenario: I rip the Dark Knight DVD, and place it in Dropbox as a legal backup of my content.

Its called ripping because DVDs content is locked with an encrypted key, so locked DVD with a movie is not just a folder with files you can copy over to your desktop. Years ago there was a movie when they forgot to lock the key and based off of it software developers were able to build a key decryptor for any encrypted DVD. Most DVD ripping software is illegal throughout the world, at least some software vendors got lawsuit over their software functionality.<p>Further, while I dont have a link handy, but I recall there was a discussion on HN that 9th circuit make it illegal for anyone to stream any copyrighted content, whether to themselves or a group of people.

GarageBand has been included free on any semi-recently purchased Mac. iWeb who knows; Keynote, Pages, and Numbers are very low cost (and FWIW they each probably share code with iBooks Author).<p>Imagine for a moment that the next update to Xcode or GarageBand included EULA language similar to what the OP is complaining about.  Would you defend it on the grounds you cite above, or not?  And if not, why not?<p>Are there any other free applications on the Mac App Store that contain similar license language?  If a third-party developer had a free application rejected from the Mac App Store for including this type of license language in the EULA, would you be surprised, or would you find the rejection consistent with the expectations that Apple has set for non-expert users on the platform?<p>If the ""iBooks Author"" application were something that had to be downloaded from inside an iBooks Developer Program portal, where you had to accept the license language as an explicit step to getting a portal account, I wouldn't care so much.  But Apple literally held a press conference to tell the whole world ""hey this shiny free shovel is going to enable happy rainbow pony time for the children, and everyone with a Mac and something to write for the children should download it right now and start digging.""<p>>Very often today we've seen Apple offer all kinds of new and innovative things, and I've seen a content stream of comments along the lines of ""these are bad because apple profits from them"". Of course Apple profits. We all profit, though, because they changed the economics of the education situation. If you want something different, create it.<p>I totally agree with you on this point.

In reality Gutenberg's press went into operation around 1450. That's 562 years ago, meaning you're off by more than a century and a half.<p>You do a bit better with copyright law. The first appearance of law that grants the right to copy to the author was, of course, the Statue of Anne (1709/10, depending on whether you're referring to the Julian calendar that was in effect in England at the time, or the Gregorian calendar which has since become the international standard). Here, you're only off by a century.<p>Unfortunately for your theory, it's a century in the wrong direction. In reality, there were a solid 260 years between the appearance of the press, and the emergence of individual copyright, and that's not ""shortly after"" by any definition.<p>Even if you start the clock in 1493, which is when the publishing business as such really came into its own with Anton Koberger, you're still off by a factor of more than 200 years. So any idea that individual copyright appeared as an immediate and necessary consequence of the press's invention is unsupported by the facts, as is the idea that there's never been a significant amount of time in which one existed without the other.<p>For the record, the rest of your theory is as sketchy as your grasp of history - especially the bit about protecting ""thought and opinion"". Those are two things that Copyright absolutely DOES NOT protect. Nor has it ever. So clearly you've still got a lot of work to do, but that's all the time we have today.<p>Class dismissed.",1327030320

Usually, because they are so knowledgeable and thoughtful that they can, as soon as they start saying anything, see a million possible caveats. In the worst case that can be paralyzing, but it can also help avoid the opposite behavior: the hot-headed, confident, untimid person who just doesn't really know enough (or think over what they know) to realize why they should be more cautious about overarching claims, especially on questions that a <i>lot</i> of smart people have looked into already.<p>It's not a universal correlation, but I've generally noticed junior and less knowledgeable people (graduate students, early-career professors, etc.) to be much more brash, confident, and even aggressive in that sense than accomplished researchers, though there is a bit of an inverted-U curve (undergraduates and 1st-year graduate students tend to be very timid).

I currently know C/C++, Python, x86/ARM asm and some Java.\nExcuse me if my English is not good enough, I'm not a native speaker and my writing skills are non-existent.\nLinks at the bottom.<p>Here's my story<p>Two months ago, I participated in Google Code-In. Now for those who don't know, briefly: it's an international contest specifically for <18 high school students that \nallows them to contribute to opensource work. Participating organizations present tasks to be completed by the students. There are easy tasks (1 point),\nmedium tasks (2 points) and hard tasks (4 points). The contest's duration is two months (it just ended) and the top 10 on the leaderboard win the grand prize\nwhich is a free week at Google HQ in California, Mountain View. Google also awards $100 for every 3 tasks completed by every student up to a max of $500 (irrelevant of difficulty).<p>I worked pretty hard throughout the contest with VideoLAN. I optimized a lot of ARM assembly functions in x264. You can see my patches in the task submissions.\nRecently, we all received this email [0] on the mailing list and nobody was sure what it was all about. Some said that many 4-pointers VideoLAN tasks took very little time to complete\nand students could easily spam them and jump up the ranking list. Either way, Google never really clarified it and a couple of days ago, they decided they were going to nullify\n/every/ VideoLAN task completed after Jan 5th. [1]<p>I worked in bulk. I wrote a boatload of functions and towards the end of the contest I submitted the tasks one after the other. Before their decision I had 104 points and \nranked 12th, after that I went down to 36 (32nd). Assembly is known to be hard and many of the fellow students in the top ten approved about how hard they were and stated how ""awesome"" \ngoogle's decision (before we knew it) can be for me (they should've nullified only the tasks they thought were easy and ACTUALLY reviewed them) so I'd have gone up and into the\ntop 10, instead, I lost all what my work was worth.<p>The top ten were not affected by the change (they all stayed, just their ranks changed). I worked hard and honest and I was the only one who was most severely affected.\nI complained many times to no avail, each time the admins stating they can do nothing about it and they are extremely sorry. I can't accept the apologies. \nI want my points back. This could've helped me a lot in my resume.<p>I posted here because I wanted more opinion on the matter. Perhaps I'm making too much of this and should've just pretended it never happened.\nIf this is not the right place please ignore.<p>There are a number of points as to why I'm outraged:\n1) The change does not make any sense and Google did not offer any clarification when I asked them and many other solutions made more sense. Nobody knows what Jan 5 has got to do with it.\n2) I was one of the students who worked the hardest, and I was also the only one who dropped.\n3) The reason I worked in bulk was because some of the mentors were busy, so it was really not my fault.\n4) Translation tasks existed, and some of the students used Google Translate (which is cheating). Other students created many accounts and mass-claimed tasks to block others\nfrom working on them.<p>GCI Leaderboard: http://www.google-melange.com/gci/leaderboard/google/gci2011\nMy task list: http://www.google-melange.com/gci/student_tasks/google/gci2011/jacktheripper\n[0]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gci-discuss/96W3bz6GcEI\n[1]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gci-discuss/tzFAmEp7CwQ<p>This may have been the cause of the whole issue: http://sachdevashubham.blogspot.com/2012/01/google-code-in-and-videolan-vlc.html",1327028987

The fact that PC sales are normally very low (around a tenth) of console sales for the same title and games without multiplayer are pirated at a much higher rate than multiplayer games is common knowledge and entirely uncontroversial within the game development industry, and always factors into decisions about how much money to invest in PC titles. Pretty much all the major shifts in PC gaming since the late '90s - cheap console ports, the emphasis on multiplayer, MMOs, Steam, etc - have been responses to piracy.",1327028704

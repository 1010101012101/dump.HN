Google's TOS for example states:<p>>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.<p>It's reasonable to assume that people are using Gmail as a verification email for other services, so they could actually be breaching their own TOS by giving someone's username to someone else, since when you've used a Gmail account for even three months, it becomes personal information that should be protected.<p>Ethically speaking, all services should be doing due diligence when reassigning usernames. This isn't IRC, all of these services are marketing themselves as identity gateways, and reassigning identities without cause borders on outright fraud. In this case of course, they're actually acting as they normally do, trying to make sure that online identities match legal identities, so it's more understandable, and probably protects them from allegations that they're facilitating fraud.

Languages are just tools, and you better use one that fits the job"".<p>You could try to go against this trend: ""But, because it's big doesn't mean we have to use C++.

So my brother and I stole Dan’s idea and came up with the “Friends-with-Benefits” Facebook app (http://friends-with-benefits.me).<p>Currently the game play is similar to Crush Notifier’s:
1. Each user picks the friends they want as “Friends with Benefits”
2. If their friends pick them back, we will send them both a notification email so that they can take their relationship to the next level; otherwise, the picks are kept secret.<p>We give our users 2 free “Picks”, and if they want more Picks, they can purchase them using Facebook Credits equivalent to US$1.00/Pick.  But we are trying to come up with another way of approaching this:<p>Instead of charging for each Pick they use, we will let them pick an unlimited number of friends.  When a match occurs, they can choose to pay US$5.00 if they want us to reveal the match. Our goal is to attract more users to use our app with the free Picks while also optimizing our revenues.<p>Please let us know what you guys think, any positive and/or negative comments are much appreciated.",1299865509

You can't afford the cost of lifecycle maintenance on a bespoke CMS.</i><p>Us at The Texas Tribune or potential Armstrong users? We're doing pretty fine with our CMS. Armstrong users won't have to pay to maintain an entire CMS since community maintenance should take care of most of their needs. They'll have to pay to maintain their templates and additions to the CMS, <i>but they're already paying for those with their current CMS</i>. I think Armstrong will end up saving many news organizations money over going with a proprietary solution.<p>> <i>3. Newspaper editors make horrible PM's on software development projects.</i><p>Is this in regard to the Armstrong project itself or implementations of it? There's little editorial interaction with Armstrong. We know what the two newsrooms involved need, and we've already built a CMS that satisfies those needs. Now we're abstracting out our unique needs and trying to anticipate the places where other implementors will need to make customizations. I think it'll work out fine.<p><i>Now that we've estabished your efforts are (at best) doomed to mediocrity drop what you're doing immediately and go check out Pressflow.</i><p>No thanks.

Maybe you mean ""viable for low-budget, independent developers"" (no expensive devkit needed)? It's not that widespread on consoles: Nintendo still seem to be doing well, and none of their platforms support anything close to OpenGL. I'm aware that there is an OpenGL ES implementation for the PS3, but I'd be surprised if that was the only way or even the preferred method of talking to the graphics chip. In my experience, game console graphics programming is usually super low level, with the ""API"" consisting of a bunch of inline C functions and enum constants for twiddling GPU hardware registers, filling DMA buffers and handling interrupts.<p>Graphics APIs serve 2 purposes:<p>1. hardware and OS independence (consistent API for the same OS running on different GPU hardware, or for porting software between OSes)<p>2. sandboxing apps to prevent direct hardware access. The latter is useful for any multitasking platform, whether it's explicitly multi-tasking or just to shield the foreground app from accessing stuff running in the background, like on older iOS versions.<p>If you care about neither, or the latter is taken care of in hardware (IOMMU), then raw access to the GPU lets you do stuff that's way cooler than you could do with a driver and an API (though it's usually more work).",1299863697

It&#x27;s clear that someone who got the flu vaccine this year is less likely to die than someone who didn&#x27;t, all else being equal. But flu shots only confer partial immunity for 6 months or so, whereas getting the real flu confers partial immunity for decades. At least the last time I looked, I wasn&#x27;t able to find any convincing evidence that someone getting the flu vaccine every year from birth would be in a better place at age 70 than someone who, say, just got the actual flu every year until they started getting the vaccine at age 70 or whatever.

9057775,comment,9056922,9057716,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"Exactly. When you know enough science (which will likely require you to be biased towards it, as otherwise the education system will make sure you don&#x27;t learn any of it) things start to increasingly fall into place. You&#x27;ll see that the whole body of things you know is internally consistent. It has to be, because the reality itself is.<p>So as you learn more and more facts and see how interwoven they are you&#x27;re able to evaluate further information without having to base on trust alone. If, say, vaccines were harmful or synthetically produced compounds were somewhat &quot;toxic&quot; compared to the same compounds found in normal food, you&#x27;d have to literally throw half of your scientific knowledge away. So you can easily determine that those claims are bullshit. But that requires knowing relatively lot of stuff, which majority of people do not. They have to rely on trusting authorities - which keep lying all the time. So no surprise here that people just don&#x27;t believe science or government and are drawn towards various pseudoscientific nonsense that is presented as contrarian and promoted by charismatic individuals.",1424105903

9057769,comment,9056799,9057441,0,0,secoif,,,"The real benefit of one language everywhere is reduced penalty for context switching and flexibility with your architecture.<p>The promise of &quot;code reuse&quot; is very alluring but reusing <i>application code</i> rarely happens in reality. However, reuse of patterns and libraries is very common – solve a generic problem once and you don&#x27;t have to research how to achieve the equivalent in another ecosystem. Just grab the exact same library, browserify the thing and you&#x27;re done (ideally).<p>&quot;One language everywhere&quot; grants you lots of flexibility – where your code executes is no longer locked in stone – you can shift responsibilities from the server to client & vice-versa without significant overhead. No need to port to a different language which perhaps lacks similar paradigms or tooling. Doors are opened to optimisations and architectural changes that would not have even been a consideration otherwise.<p>To get the benefits of &quot;one language everywhere&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean &quot;use JavaScript&quot; but it&#x27;s a safe decision to choose the lowest common denominator; JavaScript is not going out of fashion any time soon, it runs on nearly every platform and has an ecosystem that&#x27;s competitive in a wide gamut of problems. An investment in vanilla JS will pay out in long term, while any investment in Framework-X or compile-to-js Y or AltJS-Z is high risk and usually only pays out for the 18 months or so while said tool is in vogue.<p>JS may not be the best choice, but it&#x27;s a smart choice.",1424105857

Why, that&#x27;s one of the tenets of Zen.<p>At the same time, while reducing certain parts to a paradoxical simplicity, Apple knows where the effort should be directed: at building systems. Getting to the root of problems and optimizing them away. Asking the question, what is the core from which all of this grows? What is its form?

People don&#x27;t trust their government, they don&#x27;t trust corporations, and they don&#x27;t trust scientist. And I increasingly believe they have perfectly good reasons for that.<p>You see, governments lie and cheat all the time. Companies at every scale - from startups to mom and pop shops to LLCs to corporations keep abusing the social contract for their own short-term gains. Newspapers report science in ridiculous ways, journalist keep inventing their own lies to spice up the story. It&#x27;s hard to know who to trust anymore. And so people revert to trusting plausible sounding narratives and charismatic individuals.<p>This problem is going to hit us hard in the nearby future. I fear this is an existential threat for western civilization. That&#x27;s also the reason why lying to people is one of the biggest sins in my book. As the quote goes, &quot;Promoting less than maximally accurate beliefs is an act of sabotage. Don&#x27;t do it to anyone unless you&#x27;d also slash their tires.&quot; I think it&#x27;s actually underrepresenting the damage lies cause to society.<p>People nowdays see the failure of trust and strive to design systems that don&#x27;t depend on trusting its actors at all. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a good direction. As we increasingly don&#x27;t expect trustworthiness from other people, we&#x27;re digging ourselves deeper into the hole.<p>So yes, anti-vaxxers, anti-GMOs, anti-nuclear, et al. are wrong. Stupidly wrong. But it&#x27;s hard for me to blame them. They&#x27;ve been lied to so many times that it&#x27;s hard for them to trust authorities anymore.<p>EDIT: to clarify, in the last paragraph I meant that those people simply arrived to wrong (or dangerously wrong) conclusions, <i>not</i> that they themselves are stupid.",1424105359

First, ANNs tend to be mostly feedforward, while rNNs are highly recurrent. ANNs are therefore not very good in tasks where memory is needed (I know about the developments involving LSTM neurons, but they are not analogous to the implicit memory of recurrent neural networks.) Second, ANNs usually don&#x27;t have a time dimension, the firing is essentially a floating point value instead of action potential. Third, recurrent neural network structures do not scale: an efficient/reliable/reduntant system of 100B neurons will probably have extremely different structures than another one with 100M neurons -- because of recurrency and other stuff a rNN is a chaotic process (in the sense of sensitivity to parameters) that should be stabilized by the structure.<p>And there are many-many other differences.

In 2000 at KnowNow, we were able to support over ten thousand concurrent Comet connections using a hacked-up version of thttpd, on a 1GHz CPU with 1GiB of RAM.  I’ll be surprised if you can support ten thousand Comet connections using WebSockets and websocketd even on a modern machine, say, with a quad-core 3GHz CPU and 32GiB of RAM.<p>Why would you want ten thousand concurrent connections?  Well, normal non-Comet HTTP is pretty amazingly lightweight on the server side, due to REST.  Taking an extreme example, this HN discussion page takes 5 requests to load, which takes about a second, but much of that is network latency — a total of maybe ½s of time on the server side.  But it contains 7000 words to read, which takes about 2048 seconds.  So a single process or thread on the server can handle about 4096 concurrent HN readers.  So a relatively normal machine can handle hundreds of thousands of concurrent users without breaking a sweat.<p>On the other hand, Linux <i>has</i> gotten a <i>lot</i> better since 2000 at managing large numbers of runnable processes and doing things like fork and exit.  httpdito (<a href=""http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/server.s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/server.s</a>) can handle tens of thousands of hits on a single machine nowadays, even though each hit forks a new child process (which then exits).  <a href=""http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/httpdito-readme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/httpdito-readme</a> has more performance notes.<p>On the gripping hand, httpdito’s virtual memory size is up to 16kiB, so Linux may be able to handle httpdito processes better than regular processes.",1424104969

My high karma is purely a result of very frequent commenting, and has nothing to do with status.  (Other people&#x27;s high karma combined with high average karma is probably an indicator that people respect them.  Some people have a weirdly low average - I don&#x27;t understand how ColinWright only has an average of 1.7 or rayiner only has an average of 2.7 for examples).<p>A downvoted comment will reduce your karma by one point for each downvote.  Flagged comments don&#x27;t reduce your karma but may have other effects.  A while ago I had a comment that got 50 downvotes - all of those were taken off my karma total.  There was a problem where a controversial post might be flagkilled - limiting the total loss to whatever downvotes that post gets before it&#x27;s flagkilled; or a controversial post just gets heavily downvoted but not flagkilled which means unlimited downvotes for the time that downvotes are available on that post.

I&#x27;m tempted to say something about correlation and causation here - people who submit articles that make the front page get lots of karma, rather than users with lots of karma get front pages more easily.<p>About points per minute: There are some anti-gaming algorithms that will penalise a submission if it gets too many votes too quickly.

It&#x27;s certainly true that it’s “worried about intellectual property protection”, but not in the way that you imply — intellectual property harms healthcare more than perhaps any other industry, accounting for a very substantial fraction of those massively overinflated costs.  And it’s only through pushing through exceptions to the “intellectual property” regime pushed by the US, in WIPO, that India has been able to essentially end the AIDS epidemic in Africa.<p>Energy is the industry where US producers of photovoltaic panels — the primary source of marketed energy for the world starting in the 2020s — have had to seek domestic protection behind punitive tariffs against the Chinese manufacturers who are dominating the market by relentlessly copying each other’s innovations.  Evergreen Solar, the only pure-play US photovoltaic company, went bankrupt in 2011.<p>The part of the US energy industry that’s actually an economic bright spot is oil and gas extraction.  I don’t know much about their economic structure.  Maybe you can elaborate?<p>Aerospace is indeed an exception to the overall pathetic performance of the US tech industry, and the 481,400 people working in 3364 aerospace in the US are rightly proud of that, although you’ve probably noticed that a lot of US companies that want to launch satellites end up having to buy launch services from Russia or Europe.  But the US aerospace industry is largely supported by the US Department of Defense (74% of Lockheed’s income is from the military, and 45% of Boeing’s income is from BDS), and the DoD does not consider it an option to buy from lower-cost and higher-quality manufacturers in China or even Europe.  That massive DoD R&D subsidy is what enables companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin to compete overseas (admittedly, against other similarly-subsidized competitors).",1424103418

Scientific theories that are nailed down by massive experimental data and a track record of predictions accurate to many decimal places are talked about the same way, by scientists, as theories that are still being developed and refined and don&#x27;t have anywhere near the same level of confidence. Even in a single field (e.g., physics), scientists often aren&#x27;t careful to distinguish the solid base from speculative models at the frontiers (e.g., the Standard Model of particle physics vs. string theory, or the standard hot Big Bang model of cosmology from inflation and various speculations about what came before inflation).

They have an obligation to promptly disclose any and all evidence they encounter favorable to the defendant. They have an obligation to drop charges at any point that it is apparent that there is no probable cause that the defendant is guilty of a crime, and not to prosecute when it is clear that the state cannot meet its burden of proof (in a criminal matter, beyond a reasonable doubt) by admissible evidence.<p>That being said, prosecutors are humans, and often-times egotistical, political, cynical, and more than occasionally vindictive humans with all that entails. So, it is hardly uncommon to see rules already stacked in the state&#x27;s favor bent or broken.<p>Trials are virtually extinct in the USA. With few exceptions, if you find yourself going to trial, you are not in a good place. While good lawyers should be trial lawyers and unafraid of trying any triable case, the vast majority of the time if you are getting off, you are getting off pretrial with a dismissal or deferred prosecution agreement. If you lose on pretrial motions and the state is intent on prosecuting, then most of the time if your attorney can get you a deal and recommends that you take it, then it&#x27;s a choice between pride/&quot;truth&quot; and rolling dice loaded against you and paying for it big time.<p>While in principle as a defendant you are not supposed to be punished for taking your right to go to trial, the plea system punishes you heavily, and if you refuse to &quot;take responsibility&quot; by admitting guilty (the earlier the better) and expressing remorse, then you get punished even more post-conviction, with a heavier sentence, and then certainly being denied parole if that is available in the state system.",1424103257

9057473,comment,9052173,9056215,0,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"> What if my belief has always defaulted on silence, no thought?<p>Well, if you haven&#x27;t thought about something, you presumably don&#x27;t believe it? (Not to be confused with believing the negation, which you presumably also wouldn&#x27;t believe in that case.)<p>> This conversation has become too overgeneralized to say anything useful aside from the ways the mind simplifies, reduces, and applies pattern derived from observation.<p>Well, feel free to be more specific?<p>> I don&#x27;t understand the strong reaction in &#x27;knowing&#x27;. I always feel like I have to know everything all at once, in order to truly suggest that I know anything, and since I can not know everything, I only have a very vague guess of knowing some things, which are continually subject to the same analytic deconstruction and reconstruction.<p>I think I would agree. That&#x27;s why I consider the question of knowledge (in the sense of being ultimately sure about the truth of something) ultimately uninteresting. What actually matters is what you believe (that is, what you act on) because you cannot avoid interacting with the world, and you will do so based on you beliefs, whether they reflect ultimate truth or not.<p>> Ideas are broken down and rebuilt over and over and not a single one of them is a complete picture. That&#x27;s what I observe in my mind and in dialogue outside of my mind. I don&#x27;t have to believe anything about it because it&#x27;s a direct observation.<p>Well, I think that that&#x27;s questionable. On the one hand, semantically, considering something you observed directly to be true still is a belief, even if a well-founded one. One can believe things by blind faith or due to direct observation, or for many other reasons, some good, some bad. On the other hand, I would be cautious with the term &quot;direct observation&quot;: There is a ton of indirection between your brain thinking a thought and the &quot;reality&quot; outside the brain causing the thought, and conceptually there isn&#x27;t really all that much difference between observing another brain by means of that brain causing the body it&#x27;s in to create sound waves, causing your eardrum to vibrate, causing nerve signals in your brain, and the same with an MRI machine observing the same brain and feeding its images through your eyes into your brain, both are ultimately pretty indirect, even if one of the scenarios uses only natural machinery to achieve the result, so artificial machinery is not necessarily any worse at producing a reliable perception of the world than natural bodies, and you have to believe quite a few things in both cases, be it about larynxes, air, sound waves, and ears, or about MRI machines, light, and retinas.<p>> It just comes down to how angry, &#x27;strong&#x27;, assertive, or authoritative people sound, and I find that ridiculous.<p>I am not quite sure what you are trying to say with that, but I guess that science is the best way we know that avoids just that as far as possible by making it as easy as possible for anyone to reproduce an observation (at least that&#x27;s the ideal ...).<p>> It&#x27;s like being human is a stupid joke.<p>Well, from some perspective, maybe? I guess the solution is to adopt a different perspective? Like: Well, yes, ultimate knowledge seems to be unattainable--but why does that matter? It&#x27;s a philosophical curiosity, interesting to think about, but ultimately it doesn&#x27;t prevent you from improving your model of the world and interacting with the world. Your model predicts that the chair you sit on will hold you up, and it does, you don&#x27;t get hurt and can sit comfortably--does it matter whether the existence of the chair is some ultimate truth or maybe &quot;just&quot; an illusion?",1424102656

521272,comment,520836,521107,0,0,time_management,,,"Solid, but you missed the enormous influence of yield optimization, especially among the Ivy League colleges that use sophisticated models to predict yield.<p>Colleges care intensely about yield, for two reasons. The first is that it reduces uncertainty in the composition of the incoming class. The second is that it's how, internally, undergraduate admissions offices measure their colleges' relative prestige. Harvard doesn't especially care if it shows up as #4 vs. #1 in US News's capricious rankings one year, but if Harvard loses to Yale in cross-admissions, there'll be hell to pay for the Harvard admissions office. Yield numbers are the ""bottom line"" regarding how good a job the admissions office has done.<p>Yield optimization plays a <i>huge</i> role in the process. Harvard, for example, aims for an 80% yield rate and generally rejects any applicant for whom it estimates a lower-than-70% chance of attending, regardless of qualifications (my boss at a prior job knew a former Harvard admissions officer). The ""yield probability"" is based on a number of factors, but mostly number of campus visits and interviews, in addition to the other schools to which the student applied.<p>Anyone who really wants to attend a selective school has to clear the yield bar by showing a higher-than-baseline likelihood of attending. Harvard doesn't have a 75% yield rate only because of its prestige and the quality of its program-- although those are obviously very important factors-- but also because it's extremely good at selecting people who will attend.",1237355876
521271,comment,521008,521244,0,0,froo,,,"I'm not sure if you're trolling or not (the general tone of your comments in the past seems to suggest a general negative attitude), but I thought I'd address some of your points.<p><i>Let me tell you this, now you and every small time director wannabe is making a zombie movie.</i><p>Actually, I'm merely investigating the possibility of exploring the zombie theme. I'm putting together a digital animation startup and I'm looking at various genre's that, from a technical standpoint, can be done with a smallish team size for the first project.<p>Zombies aren't hard to create models for (random human generator like makehuman, appropriate skintones, add gore) and animating them can be keyframed fairly efficiently with scripts, followed by the breakdowns and finally the inbetweens can be interpolated by the computer. Then theres adjusting movements with bezier curves to get realistic arcs happening in movement to really sell it.<p>Zombies in general also don't need voice actors, which is another gain, as that means less voice talent. Ideally I'm investigating using inhouse talent to start out with, and morphing voices with various VST plugins to keep the costs low.<p>What this means is that we can get more done (using a nearly infinite set of zombies) with relatively few people animating the series over time.<p><i>Why do people do this? Cause it's cheap?</i><p>Probably, yeah... why spend money that you don't need too? Also I think that in general, people either love zombie movies or they despise them.<p>PG advocates finding a small group of users that LOVE your content and expand. This ethos seems to fit this genre.<p><i>If you want to make a movie</i><p>Actually I have no intention of making a movie. I'm planning on more episodic content that will be distributed via the web to start out with.<p>Since the whole studio model is being built on a shoestring budget, utilising open source software and different film-making techniques I'm taking a lot of PG's advice on board and treating this as a tech startup. That is what a 3D animation studio partially is, a blending of art and computer science.<p>As a result I think the zombie genre can adopt some of those ""hacker values"" for boot strapping a startup. For example, Iteration. If we don't like a character, or he's not resonating well with the audience... we can quite literally kill him off. If we take it too far, we can quite conceivably bring them back in some form.<p>The genre is flexible to the low capital studio concept, rather than a ""wannabe director wants to make a zombie movie""<p><i>I'm sick to death of zombie movies (and never liked them in the first place).</i><p>See my point about its either something you love or something you dont. It has the potential to make a decent starting point.<p><i>my son is a professional actor</i><p>Which Starbucks can I find him working at then?",1237355824

Meanwhile, places like Canada that allowed large national banking conglomerates avoided bank failures almost entirely.<p>Perhaps they didn't set the right limits, kept them too small.  Because we failed to get it right once doesn't mean we should stop trying and just accept being ripped off as a cost of doing business.<p>Either we figure out how to regulate the market such that this won't happen in the future or we nationalize the banking industry like others have done and admit that the only thing that's really to big to fail is the government.<p>> There is also danger in drawing simple, neat lessons from a messy crisis.<p>That, I agree with.

I would recommend you get an experienced industrial designer to guide you through this process. Make sure if you get quotes from China that you don't give the 3D model for the quote - give 2D technical drawings with enough information for a quote but not for full production (your industrial designer should know this). \n- PCB boards: nowadays tooling charges are quite low. We use OurPCB.com for a smallest circuit board and the tooling charge is in the low hundreds. We source the important components and get them to ship it to the PCB makers. they then send the completed PCB's to us.\n- packaging: allocatae a few thousand to set up your box or plastic packaging.<p>Stage your production:\n- pilot run (say 10 PCB boards to get all of your component logistics sorted out).\n - 1st run (100 PCB's with 100 plastic shells and packaging)\n- production run (1000 PCBs, 1000 plastic shells and packaging)<p>Assemble, program and test your devices close to you (ie. your garage :).

4575621,comment,4575177,4575285,3,0,bad_user,,,"OS X is still allowing regular people to install apps from whatever source they want, by default.<p>In Windows 8 you have to either check ""Allow all trusted applications to install"" in the Group Policy settings in Win Pro/Enterprise, or change a registry setting. This means users will have to go out of their way to install anything beyond what the App Store provides. Well, at least the option is still available.<p>Steam is an app store for games. Games purchases are impulse driven. When buying from Steam, you either go for a big title that you know you'll find on Steam or you go searching for something that triggers your interest.<p>On the other hand a large part of discovery on a regular app store is search-driven by actual needs of users that want to accomplish something very specific. Like, just the other day I searched for a way to view/manage my Picasa-stored photos on my iPad.<p>The number of apps is important for one because this means the app store doesn't solve many specific problems users are having and because Microsoft is known to have a big developer ecosystem since forever (building platforms is what they do best) - and so this lack of enthusiasm reflects badly on them and on Windows 8.",1348667989

Same with roof tiles.<p>To me it seems that prefabricated elements become a problem if they are too large relative to the building's total size. It's hard to make an interesting lego house using 200 lego bricks because the square shape of the lego bricks define the shape of the house. But if you use 20,000 lego bricks the shape of the building doesn't appear to be defined by the shape of the individual bricks.

We have a Projet 1500 and an original Makerbot at my hackerspace (Columbus Idea Foundry). The Projet absolutely kills the makerbot for resolution and jitter. If you made a sphere on the projet, it will be pretty damn smooth. On the Makerbot (original) it will have a strong texture to it. No experience with Replicator 2.<p>Yet, its also around 10x as expensive to run (ABS is cheap, whereas the liquid stuff is expensive). It also takes a lot more room (there's separate machines for a drying/curing thing). The resolution on the Projet 1500 (which isnt the best one in the world, just what we have) is pretty limited at like 1024x768 since it uses a projector instead of a laser. I'm thinking the laser might allow for finer resolution, but I'm not sure.<p>Also, our Projet machine won't operate (like, at all) if its above 75F. Most of our hackerspace is un-airconditioned in a warehouse, so that just doesn't work. We had to get an AC and put it in an office. Extruder machines just don't care.<p>I haven't used the Replicator 2, but the replicator looks promising. At the same time, if the Formlabs ones does as it says, then its a HUGE move forward as its around 1/10th the price of something like our Projet 1500.<p>This looks pretty exciting initially.

The important question is: will the upfront cost and disruption be worth it?<p>The data presented by the city of Munich six months ago provides compelling evidence that the answer is a resounding YES: the <i>recurring savings</i> from migration will exceed its upfront costs.[1]<p>The city of Munich identified three types of cost savings: (1) it no longer has to pay for license upgrades, eliminating a significant recurring cost forever; (2) its desktop software and hardware no longer have to be updated as frequently, reducing another significant recurring cost forever; and (3) surprisingly, Munich claims its IT department is fielding fewer user complaints with free software, reducing another major cost forever.<p>--<p>Edit: There's an additional benefit from migration not mentioned by Munich which I think will become very important over time.  According to this article, the French government intends to reinvest ""between 5 percent and 10 percent of the money they save"" on contributing to the development of the applications they use, so they will have <i>direct, hands-on input</i> into which features get added to such applications and even how such features are implemented.  The French government, in other words, will become a 'co-owner' of these Free Software applications, giving them more control over their own IT future.

If you don't make your mortgage or rent payments, you don't get to stay for free. There are automobile finance companies for a similar demographic that will disable the car when payment isn't made. It's not like the car stops working when you're a day late. The computer warns the driver long before disabling the car. Kinda makes sense to give your 'customer' a warning and maintain her ability to drive to you to make payments.<p>And what's this ""force a fake popup""? What's a fake popup versus a real one? Perhaps the store's systems should know who has rented which machines. But I suspect this is more about tracking the computer's location for recovery when payments are behind.<p>So here's my take: invasion of <i>privacy</i> is a big problem and should be prosecuted. Disabling service and recovering property that hasn't been paid for just makes sense.

For me, the difference between technical training (or vocational, or OP's self-inflicted syllabus) and education (college, university) is that the former gives you a great hands-on real-world grasp of the available tools and techniques and how to use them to solve problems. The latter gets you further into the ""why"", and makes you better suited to making your own tools and techniques.

So you have these two fighting against each other."") Brand's book How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built is all about the many modifications that building owners make to buildings over time as the economy changes, as new materials and technologies are invented, and as buildings change owners.

I think they are going to find its going to be used by no one.""</i><p>Absolutely.<p>They should not be chasing the consumer, iOS-esque market. Some would say they've lost it, but I'd actually challenge that they never had it. Blackberry has always been an enterprise and small business solution. Historically, unless my numbers are way off, most consumers didn't own smartphones in the Blackberry Era. By and large, those who owned Blackberries were either using company-issued Blackberries, or had used company-issued Blackberries and purchased personal ones on the side. Kids and casual consumers had Motorola RAZRs and other non-smart phones.<p>The critical implication here is that the Blackberry did <i>not</i> open the floodgates of mass, consumer smartphone adoption. The iPhone did (and lately, the iPhone and Android have been).<p>In the years of Blackberry's dominance over the smartphone market, the smartphone market was comparatively small and concentrated. And, very important, it was use-case-specific (email). This was differentiated from the predominant mass-consumer use case (SMS). So there was a clear and safe divide between the two segments.<p>RIM was making a fortune in those days, but then it assumed that it needed to follow suit when the iPhone launched. And it's been all downhill from there.<p>Meanwhile, there are still a fair number of enterprise and small business owners and CTOs who prefer Blackberry to iOS/Android for business, and who buy Blackberry for their businesses. That number is dwindling rapidly, as you point out, the more Blackberries start to resemble half-hearted iPhones. But it's still a very lucrative niche that RIM can purpose-build for. I would bet, however, as you seem to, that RIM fails to capture it.<p>So what <i>can</i> RIM do to stay relevant in enterprise? For one thing, don't shy away from the keyboard. Embrace it. It's a point of clear differentiation, and though the cool kids will scoff at it, many business executives still prefer it for email. They might always prefer it. Second, develop more robust enterprise software. Blackberry should be able to handle spreadsheets, Powerpoint, word processing, data visualization(!!!), cross-device integration (printers, etc.), and other key enterprise solutions in a way that iPhone and Android don't.<p>This is not going to be easy. And it'll be especially difficult, in as much as many of the standard enterprise software solutions are offered by Microsoft, a competitor. Nobody's going to use a RIM-only spreadsheet program that doesn't integrate with Excel, for instance.",1348665186

One of the biggest problems with being smart is that it makes one especially prone to listening to and trusting in words, because one is so used to doing so due to the fact that it was the rewarded and reinforced behavior throughout their entire life, which remember, has consisted of little but schooling for such people up to that point. It takes additional training or practice to break out of that. After a lifetime of words about how wonderful this career path is, how suited to it they are, and how it&#x27;s their natural goal, it cuts down to their personal identity to realize that the words were not true, and that&#x27;s a hard thing to go through. (I am not being even slightly sarcastic. That can literally drive people to suicidal levels of emotional pain.)",1420829997

And that will be, by far, the hardest part.<p>The technical stuff will be pretty much trivial. Any decently constructed app on any decent framework (Rails, etc) on any decent host (AWS, DO) would be able to handle a 10k user app (probably maxing out at 1% online at same time) without breaking a sweat.<p>And you will have plenty of time to build out the tech because it will probably take you many months to get to even a few thousand users (depending on what kind of app it is, of course).",1420829995

8863707,comment,8856864,8860460,0,0,geoelectric,,,"Because if Rdio and Spotify don&#x27;t count against my data cap because of a paid agreement, a new entrant into music is probably not going to get much of my attention.<p>They&#x27;d have to be -so- much better than the existing leaders that I&#x27;m willing to pay for a higher cap or sacrifice part of my current cap to use them.<p>That effectively means that to be taken seriously, a new entrant <i>has</i> to pay the ISPs for exemption from the cap. Further, if the ISPs can choose not to make agreements with companies, they become the gatekeepers of who will be successful. Piss them off, and you lose your agreement.<p>This is anticompetitive, for sure, but the FTC has no jurisdiction over common carriers. AT&T is currently flogging this argument based on cc status on phone to escape reprisal from the FTC about lying about &quot;unlimited&quot; plan vs. their throttling policy that effectively caps such a plan to 5 GB. The say that because they&#x27;re a phone CC, the FTC has to be hands-off period on all their business concerns.<p>I suspect that&#x27;ll be found to be BS. However, if broadband is Title II, but we add an exemption to allow anti-competitive agreements around caps, there&#x27;s literally zero remedy. It&#x27;s specifically not under jurisdiction of the FTC unless Congress changes that particular law.<p>So, not a huge worry of mine as long as it&#x27;s a &quot;exempt all music, anyone can apply,&quot; but big worry if it&#x27;s &quot;exempt Spotify only.&quot; There are plenty of streaming markets that aren&#x27;t sufficiently mature to be commodities yet (PPV on-demand movies like VUDU, iTunes, CinemaNow, Flixter; remote gaming like OnLive, Sony; etc.) and even the ones that are shouldn&#x27;t be immune from shakeups.",1420829906

Suicide needs a different level of proof (&quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;, not &quot;balance of probabilities&quot;) - these two factors led to under-recording of suicide in national statistics.

The language will continue evolving rapidly after 1.0, and even the 1.0 release will contain several known (and sometimes rather unfortunate) restrictions that will be backwards-compatibly lifted over time.<p>Post-1.0, I expect there to be a large community outreach to determine which work to prioritize (for example, I foresee a great clamor for making macros more usable). With developer help I intend to publish a blog post before then detailing exactly which deficiencies Rust 1.0 will contain, and the use cases that they currently either prevent or make awkward.",1420828001

I would say 90% of them were bought just to cook beans every other day. The basic brazilian way is to simply cook the beans in the pressure cooker with nothing else but water. Then we it reaches the biting point you want (between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the beans) you take a big spoon of that, smash it in another pan with garlic and some chopped onions and oil and then put it back into the cooker, plus salt to taste.

Do black holes exist or not?<p>Civilian&#x27;s answer is extremely good but it&#x27;s worth expanding on.<p>Physicists have a weird relationship with the world, often mediated through theory but deeply grounded in fact. As such, we often attach &quot;theoretical names&quot; to raw empirical phenomena that have a relatively high level of contingency associated with them, and we then talk about those names as if they were the real thing, dragging the whole baggage of the theory behind us.<p>This is really useful as it lets us live for a time in the ideal world of theory without bothering too much about the messy experimental details. We can get away with it because we are committed to always coming back to reality in the end.<p>To outsiders this creates confusion, because we take a bundle of empirical data and label it &quot;black hole&quot; or &quot;dark matter&quot; as if we were referring to the reality rather than an explicitly and carefully constructed theory (not model) of reality. We then reason about that theory and try to find ways to extend it, test it, etc. If it passes enough tests (including tests of internal consistency, consistency with other well-thought-of theories, etc) we treat it as &quot;good enough for going on with&quot;, which to outsiders looks like &quot;true&quot;, but because science is Bayesian we cannot ever assign a theory a plausibility of unity (which is what &quot;true&quot; would mean, if it could mean anything). There is always room for doubt [0].<p>So when you ask &quot;do black holes exist or not&quot;? there is no simple answer, because we are in a mixed state, holding contingent beliefs but talking about them in non-contingent ways (because we simply don&#x27;t have the language or mental capacity to do that.) GR has solutions that would explain a great deal of stuff we see in the sky. We call those solutions &quot;black holes&quot;. There turn out to be some consistency issues with those solutions that have recently lowered the plausibility of the proposition &quot;GR solutions with singularities explain compact stellar objects greater than 1.4 solar masses&quot; (1.4 solar masses is about the limit for neutron star stability, so we infer anything larger is a black hole.)<p>So where we are today is that the proposition &quot;Standard GR and QM give an extremely good account of a large range of astronomical and cosmological phenomena that go under the name &#x27;black holes&#x27;&quot; is still very plausible, but that is different from &quot;black holes exist&quot; or &quot;black holes don&#x27;t exist&quot;, and always will be.<p>There is a very important sense in which your question simply doesn&#x27;t address the issue that science is concerned with, which is finding propositions that are maximally plausible, not &quot;true&quot;.<p>[0] This is true of all propositions whatsoever, including Bayes&#x27; rule itself.",1420827759

The linked essay talks about &quot;the 20 years of your adult life that a scientist typically spends proving they deserve a career.&quot;<p>You can be a newly minted, bar-passed, practicing lawyer after spending 7 years of your adult life, and 6 years if you diligently optimize your course selections (typically 4 years undergrad, 3 years law school, plus a few months studying for the bar exam). That&#x27;s a heck of lot less than 20 years, and matters a <i>lot</i> in terms of female fertility, the topic of the essay.<p>And about 20% of new law school graduates will be making six figures in their new job. There&#x27;s a sharp peak in the distribution of full-time salaries for new lawyers centered around $185K because of big law, with a larger, flatter peak centered around $60K thanks to small firms, nonprofits, and work that doesn&#x27;t actually require a law degree. Those figures come from NALP data, and reflect the situation even <i>during</i> the lawyer/law school bubble the U.S. is in today.<p>Note I&#x27;m not saying law is a necessarily a wiser choice; I know one big law associate who slept overnight on a partner&#x27;s couch so much I helped her with the transport of a small refrigerator so she could keep meals at work.

However, I find that the post offers little insight.<p>I have a special reason to seek this insight: I did nearly the same thing, and my app makes THREE figures per YEAR. I read this post hoping to gain some insights as to why. I was disappointed.<p>Actually, I didn&#x27;t do what he did. If I did what he did, I would be making all that money. My complaint about the post is that it didn&#x27;t help me discern the key differences.<p>In March 2010 I introduced Bill It [1], a time tracking app. I was motivated by my own need combined with a desire to get into the exciting world of mobile apps. Like the author, I was a .NET developer by day. As a contractor I wanted something for myself, and I figured I was not unique.<p>I want to be very clear that I am not surprised of my lackluster results or jealous of his success. (Well maybe a bit jealous.) I approached it as a build-it-and-maybe-someone-will-come-but-who-cares-because-its-fun-and-I-learned-something kind of thing. It hurts my head a little to think about it marketing, so I built it and threw it out there.<p>But so did he: &quot;Surprised to see it getting some traction, I decided I should take HoursTracker a bit more seriously.&quot;<p>His app took off with no marketing at all. Mine did not. Had I been able to say this about Bill It, my whole story would have played differently. Had I seen the proverbial fishing pole starting to bend, I would have grabbed it and stared reeling, as he did. Is that a post hoc rationalization? Maybe, but I don&#x27;t think so.<p>So what made the difference? Time-to-market? Features? Try-ability? Pricing?<p>TIME-TO-MARKET<p>As others have said, time-to-market is important because the app store keeps the winners at the top, and it&#x27;s easier to get to the top early on. Maybe I was just too late to have a chance without serious marketing. Who knows?<p>FEATURES<p>My &quot;killer feature&quot; was supposed to be Quickbooks Integration. I was running my consulting business on Quickbooks, and I needed to get my hours input in order for billing to be linked to payments, deposits, revenue, etc. I created a very nice feature set to accomplish quite smoothly (if I say so myself). I decided not to add a timer. I explain the rationale in the product description. Perhaps this was a bad decision. Who knows?<p>TRY-ABILITY<p>Bill It launched shortly before in-app purchases were introduced. So I created a &quot;lite&quot; version and a full version. As soon as in-app purchases came out, I added a &quot;full&quot; purchase in the lite app. Did I &quot;accidentally give too much away for free?&quot; No. If anything, I erred on the opposite side. The Quickbooks integration took some setup work, so my main goal for the lite version was to allow the user to verify it before paying. I only allowed 5 time entries, which was plenty to see how the app works but not enough to actually use it. Maybe that was the problem. Who knows?<p>PRICING<p>Just before Bill It came out, another time tracker featuring Quickbooks integration came out. Although I thought my integration feature was superior, their app seemed to have a few more features and a little more polish, so I tracked just below their price, ending up at $8.99 (about the same as the pro version of HoursTracker), which is still a high price as apps go. Maybe a different pricing strategy would have been better. Who knows?<p>I want to clarify another point. I don&#x27;t expect the author the know what made him successful where I and others weren&#x27;t. My real complaint is that the rest of us expect that of him. From the first word of his title, &quot;How,&quot; we can see that he wants to meet this unrealistic expectation. The post would have been better titled &quot;HoursTracker earns five figures a month on the App Store&quot; but then no one would read it I guess.

Eliminate the pointless, unnecessary task, and accept the non-consequence of not doing it.<p>They can hire a professional administrator to do it.  Naturally, the administrator will in turn hire an underling to perform all the unnecessary tasks, and retain all vital tasks for himself.  But now that the administrator has an employee, that creates an additional  management burden, to ensure that person is doing the pointless unnecessary tasks <i>correctly</i> and <i>before the deadline</i>.<p>It is clear that professional administrators and academics have different incentives with regard to administrative overhead.  One would prefer to see it grow without bound, whereas the other would prefer to see it shrink to its minimum viable size.<p>The colossal mistake that too many organizations have made in the past is to allow the administrators to control the administrative budget.  That is the one thing that absolutely cannot be delegated away from the people doing the core work of the business.",1420826426

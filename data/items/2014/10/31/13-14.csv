They standardize job titles.  They link job titles to salary scales (A,B,C,D) and then have sub scales (1-15) for &#x27;experience&#x27; (years at the company) or performance (positive performance reviews).  The problem is there are always huge loopholes:<p>&quot;Ok, the experience scale can also count time at similar positions at other companies&quot; Well, that sounds reasonable...  &quot;Also if you have a lot of industry connections we&#x27;ll count that as experience&quot;  Um, okay... &quot;also if management is impressed by a junior hire&#x27;s capabilities we can apply that towards the experience scale&quot; wait...  and &quot;Well Jane, you performed really well but management only allows us to give out so many exemplary performance reviews per year&quot; what?<p>The result is that you have a beautiful salary scale in your employee handbook and a nice basis for hand-waving (your job puts you in scale B, and you&#x27;ve been here three years, so that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re at B3!), but everyone is just paid whatever they can negotiate.

It makes sense, and I&#x27;m sympathetic to it, but I&#x27;ve worked at two jobs where it was pretty well known what everyone made. There were huge disparities in what people made for doing the same work in both cases. It didn&#x27;t cause any resentment issues I know of - but I suspect it did make people more likely to ask for a raise when they knew what was possible, which I think is the problem that <i>management</i> really has with it, because it becomes much harder for them to justify to the employee why they can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t pay them more, even though there may be valid reasons for it.",1414763628

If people wanted anonymity, they&#x27;d have to swap their pre-paid card randomly and anonymously in the street.<p>If you want anonymity with bitcoins, you will have to swap them on paper, in the street.<p>And even having shuffled bitcoins, you&#x27;d have to be very careful, because there are other ways to identify entities, based on their behavior. See for example:<p><a href=""https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/718763/filename/TR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/718763/fil...</a><p><a href=""http://homepages.laas.fr/mkilliji/docs/journals/jcss.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.laas.fr/mkilliji/docs/journals/jcss.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ks640/files/papers/wpes2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ks640/files/papers/wpes2014.pdf</a><p>etc.<p>There are only 9 billion humans.  Therefore to identify one, you only need 34 bits!  Extracting the right 34 bit of information from the petabytes available each second, while requiring some mathematical and computing resources, is clearly not impossible.<p>Beware also of the Air Force 1 effect:  when the American secret services destroyed the World Trade Center, they issued an order to ground all airplanes.  All, but one, Air Force One.  And therefore everybody knew where it was, because it was the only plane in the sky keeping signaling meteorological data.<p>Similarly, when everybody is tracked on facebook, on ApplePay and on bitcoin (however anonymously), getting outside of those tracking system only serves to flag and identify your even better!<p>We&#x27;re certainly very close to have a system like in Minority Report, where not only real-time tracking of everybody will be relatively easy, but of course, probabilistic prevision of (near) future behavior will be possible as well.<p>When you can track with a high resolution spy satellite or drone somebody in downtown Los Angeles at 11:43, you can predict with quite a certainty that he won&#x27;t be in New York at 11:50.  Given physical constraints and Bayes statistics, you can predict quite a lot.<p><a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2269563/The-U-S-militarys-real-time-Google-Street-View-Airborne-spy-camera-track-entire-city-1-800MP.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2269563/The-U...</a>",1414763575

This did indeed lead to a rate of development and collecting far too much crap along the way, which has been problematic since.<p>However, Symbian are a great example of the opposite, in the sense their development had slowed to a crawl. Things like OpenGL and anti-aliased text rendering appeared first in feature phone user interfaces, and then moved up - it was nuts. Quite how Nokia, in particular, remained oblivious to the potential UI improvements the new stuff enabled is beyond me, but then a good number of us were floored by just how bad the performance of the G1 was.<p>The &quot;improvements&quot; you mention are, with the exception of the bought in runtime, inconsequential. We&#x27;ve been through the phase where people wanted to use WebViews for most of the apps (I was a champion of that idea at one time) and it sucked. Do things like Google Now use the WebView for rendering their UI? Now that the lower levels are approaching good the real problems that remain are much more pervasive, causing an unbelievable amount of app developer time to be wasted (at Google too), and the sad thing is it doesn&#x27;t look like they will ever be fixed because the answer will be &quot;we&#x27;re replacing them with web stuff&quot; which is an answer no one making this stuff actually wants.",1414762990

Here are my thoughts on it, for what they&#x27;re worth to you.<p>I&#x27;ve suffered from depression for most of my life, so I&#x27;ve spent a great deal of time thinking about it, &#x27;Why me?  Why do I feel this way?&#x27;  I have tried to &#x27;cure&#x27; it with therapy (CBT).  I&#x27;ve tried to cure it by adjusting the chemicals in my brain with medications.  Neither of these have worked well, or at least they have been temporary fixes.<p>After 30 years or so, I&#x27;ve discovered a much simpler approach: remove all of the things in one&#x27;s life that doesn&#x27;t &#x27;seem&#x27; right or &#x27;feel&#x27; right.  Like any other disease (take diabetes, for example) some people have a genetic predisposition for it.  But, in many cases, the odds of being affected is a combination of both one&#x27;s genetics and environment.  I try to solve my depression by thinking similarly.  That is, awareness and sensitivity to one&#x27;s environment are factors in the disease for those with a natural disposition for these traits.<p>Perhaps the mushroom experience has opened your brain to new insights and awareness, and these are now negatively affecting you?<p>I suggest trying CBT and medications: they&#x27;re the right things to do, medically. But, concurrently, try to start removing things from your life, even if temporarily.  It&#x27;s can be difficult process to remove from one&#x27;s life the things that cause disease because they&#x27;re often enjoyable (bacon to a heart disease sufferer).  In the case of depression, it may mean removing things that help define one&#x27;s identity.  Perhaps it means quitting jobs, selling houses, getting divorce, abandoning friends, changing habits, changing patterns of thought, solving addictions, destroying routines.<p>In the end, all I can give you is anecdote, but if the depression remains or gets worse, it&#x27;s at least worth a shot.<p>Edit:<p>I&#x27;m suggesting taking a systematic and rational approach for finding the environmental factors. I&#x27;m not suggesting that anyone go out and do these things without thought, wholesale, on impulse. But, unless the ratio of positive to negative is above 1, they&#x27;re at least things to consider changing. It&#x27;s up to each person to determine what these things could be.",1414761855

Second, even if I grant you deistic god who may have perhaps started the universe, you still have all your work ahead of you to show that this god is the god of the bible (this is pretty damning when we have so much evidence about invention and evolution of biblical god, which as it turns out is a man made invention, see for example &quot;The evolution of God&quot; by Robert Wright, and &quot;The Early History of God&quot; by Mark Smith).<p>On the other hand, as I have already said in my previous post, positing a deistic god i.e. an idea that some god might exist who may perhaps have kicked off the universe but no longer takes interest in it is pointless. No one can in principle provide proof there is no deistic god, nor can anyone provide a proof that such a thing exists. At most we can say is such a hypothesis is no longer needed. It presupposes a lot more to assume an intelligent being capable of creating universes who either spontaneously came into being or always existed than to assume the same thing about the universe itself (i.e. dumb matter). This is why Occam&#x27;s razor cuts such hypothesis as superfluous thing, because it does not explain anything new, but poses more questions.<p>Basically, what ever you want to say about this deistic god, how it came to be etc. you can just say the same thing about the universe itself. And you would be assuming much less (no intelligence, just dumb matter). And like Pierre-Simon Laplace said, it works without that hypothesis.<p>And some of the questions you talk about do have scientific answers, like distance to the sun, balance of atmosphere etc. And others have plausible answers that don&#x27;t require supernatural.<p>I think reading something like Victor J. Stenger&#x27;s &quot;The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning&quot; would be useful.<p>And besides, the false dichotomy you set up, either we have an answer for everything or else Jesus is the Christ and we must therefore all be Christians is just not true. There is a spectrum of options in between. We could not know any answers and Christianity be false (as I maintain it is), or perhaps Hindus have it right etc.<p>You must get comfortable with not knowing, and seeking rational answers. It is those who are certain and who claim divine warrant for their certainty that belong to the infancy of our species.<p>Religion was the first and worst attempt to make sense of reality. It was the best we could do at a time when we had no concept of physics, chemistry, biology or medicine. We did not know that we lived on a round planet, let alone that the planet was in orbit in a minor and obscure solar system, which was also on the edge of an unimaginably vast cosmos that was exploding away from its original source of energy. We did not know that micro-organisms were so powerful and lived in our digestive systems in order to enable us to live, as well as mounting lethal attacks on us as parasites. We did not know of our close kinship with other animals. We believed that sprites, imps, demons, and djinns were hovering in the air about us. We imagined that thunder and lightning were portentous. It has taken us a long time to shrug off this heavy coat of ignorance and fear, and every time we do there are self-interested forces who want to compel us to put it back on again. We are pattern-seeking mammals and owing to our intelligence and inquisitiveness, we will still prefer a conspiracy theory to no explanation at all. Religion was our first attempt at philosophy, just as alchemy was our first attempt at chemistry and astrology our first attempt to make sense of the movements of the heavens. But there is a reason why religions insist so much on strange events in the sky, as well as on less quantifiable phenomena such as dreams and visions. All of these things cater to our inborn stupidity, and our willingness to be persuaded against all the evidence that we are indeed the center of the universe and that everything is arranged with us in mind.<p>There are some highly intelligent believers, but history has no record of any human being who was remotely qualified to say that they knew or understood the mind of god. Yet this is precisely the qualification which the godly must claim, so modestly and so humbly, to possess. It is time to withdraw our respect from such fantastic claims, all of them aimed at the exertion of power over others. There is no moral or intellectual equivalent between the different degrees of uncertainty here. The atheist generally says that the existence of a deity cannot be disproved. It can only be found to be entirely lacking in evidence or proof. The theist can opt to be a mere deist, and to say that the magnificence of the natural order strongly implies an ordering force. But the religious person must go further and say that this creative force is also an intervening one: one that cares for our human affairs and is interested in what we eat and with whom we have sexual relations, as well as in the outcomes of battles and wars. To assert this is quite simply to assert more than any human can possibly claim to know, and thus it falls, and should be discarded, and should have been discarded long ago.<p>Some things can be believed and some things simply cannot. I might choose to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, and that later he both did and did not die, since he was seen again by humans after the time of his apparent decease. Many have argued that the sheer unlikelihood of this story makes it fractionally more probable. Again, then, suppose that I grant the virgin birth and the resurrection. The religious still have all of their work ahead of them. These events, even if confirmed, would not prove that Jesus was the son of god. Nor would they prove the truth or morality of his teachings. Nor would they prove that there was an afterlife or a last judgment. His miracles, if verified, would likewise leave him one among many shamans and magicians, some of them mentioned in the Old Testament, who could apparently work wonders by sorcery. Many of the philosophers and logicians take the view that miracles cannot and did not occur, and Albert Einstein took the view (which some stubbornly consider to be a deist one) that the miracle is that there are no miracles or other interruptions of a wondrous natural order. This is not a difference that can be split: either faith is sufficient or else miracles are required to reassure those, including the preachers, whose faith would otherwise not be strong enough.<p>But here is something that is impossible for anyone to believe. The human species has been in existence as Homo Sapiens for at least one hundred and fifty thousand years (some would say even longer). An instant in evolutionary time, this is nonetheless a vast history when contemplated by primates with brains and imaginations of the dimensions that we can boast. In order to subscribe to monotheistic religion, one must believe that humans were born, struggled, and expired during this time, often dying in childbirth or for want of elementary nurture, and with a life-expectancy of perhaps three decades at most. Add to these factors the turf wars between discrepant groups and tribes, alarming outbreaks of disease, which had no germ theory to explain let alone palliate them, and associated natural disasters and human tragedies. And yet, for all these millennia, heaven watched with indifference and then, and only in the last six thousand years at the very least, decided that it was time to intervene as well as redeem. And heaven would only intervene and redeem in remote areas of the Middle East, thus ensuring that many more generations would expire before the news could begin to spread! Let me send a voice to Sinai and cement a pact with just one tribe of dogged and greedy yokels. Let me lend a son to be torn to pieces because he is misunderstood. Let me tell the angel Gabriel to prompt an illiterate and uncultured merchant into rhetorical flights. At last the darkness that I have imposed will lift! The willingness even to entertain such elaborately mad ideas involves much more than the suspension of disbelief, or the dumb credulity that greets magic tricks.<p>It also involves ignoring or explaining away the many religious beliefs that antedated Moses. Our primeval ancestors raised temples and altars and offered the requisite terrified obsequies and sacrifices. Their religion was man-made, like all the others. There was a time when Greek thinkers denounced Christians and Zoroastrians denounced Muslims as &quot;atheists&quot; for their destruction of old sites and their prohibition of ancient rituals. The source of desecration and profanity is religious, as we can see from the way that today’s believers violate the sanctity of each other’s temples. Richard Dawkins may have put it the best when he said everybody is an atheist in saying that there is a god, from Ra to Shiva, in which he does not believe. All that the atheists do is to go one god further. Human solipsism can generally be counted upon to become enraged and to maintain that this discountable god must not be the one in which the believer himself has invested so much credence. But the man-made character of religion persists in a terrifying shape in our own time, as believers fight each other over the correct interpretation and even kill members of their own faiths over doctrine. Civilization has been immensely retarded by such arcane interfaith quarrels and could now be destroyed by their modern versions.",1414761216

You are right to care about the wellbeing of your colleagues, that&#x27;s one of the differences between a company (and dare I say it, a &#x27;team&#x27;) and a collection of freelancers.

(for example, income tax will be collected much less efficiently, due to tax evasion, etc.)<p>Of course, another aspect is what behaviour the given tax will reward / punish, and from this viewpoint such a tax (in any form) is catastrophic, but these two aspects can a lot of the &quot;artificiality&quot; of certain taxes.",1414760529

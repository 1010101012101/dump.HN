Don't re-implement Lisp in Ruby. Clone and copy Lisp's features for your favorite language, so you don't have to emulate ./configure in a far richer environment; automake is poverty.<p>A few days ago I told the polite crowd in #ruby how I felt about the irb ruby shell. That too is lacking and there is tremendous room for improvement. Start by implementing value registers; in CL, * (star) contains the value of the last expression evaluated; (star)(star) the one before that, and (star)(star)(star) the one after the last. They come handy because you don't need to build complex binding LETs, and you don't have to pollute your current namespace creating global variables (naming something, on the spot when you're in the flow is really hard. And a convention is better than everyone inventing a trick)<p>I had to do (star) because HN ate my #\*s, Paul.",1254855242

The last time I wrote software for or explicitly supported closed source platforms is very long ago.<p>> Yes there is. One idea is opposed to the other. How can there not be polarization?<p>Because there is a lot of gray stuff in between. Closed source software that ends up being open sourced. People working for closed source companies writing open source in their spare time using company resources (with approval), closed source companies donating money, equipment, programmers and other resources to open source project and so on. Dual license software, etc. To polarize means that the issues are black and white. They're not.<p>> This is actually Stallman's point, and it was also the open source movement's point. Code is not enough. There is also the discussion of freedom or the discussion of marketing.<p>So, let's do it. Let's not attack people on the other side of the imaginary divide, if it even exists. The best way to make sure that Microsoft and company are irrelevant is to make their software irrelevant. To literally outcode them.

I'm actually friends with one of the guys who develops it, and I'm convinced it's excellent.  But ""intermediate"" it is not.<p>I'd say, if you want to establish a taxonomy of microcontroller development skill, beginner would include pretty much any pre-built kit that uses a high level language, intermediate would be people who either build their own boards or program pre-built ones in assembler, and advanced would involve discarding both pre-built boards and high level languages.<p>As good as, e.g., SDCC is, most microcontroller ISAs are just not designed with compilation in mind.  When every instruction counts, incurring gobs of overhead to accomodate a calling convention just won't cut it.<p>EDIT:
By the way, I've done a lot of development with Atmel AVR, Microchip PIC, and 8051 processors, and though the more modern RISC architecture of the AVR is leaps and bounds more friendly to compilation than the PIC, I can regularly beat AVR-gcc and SDCC for code size.<p>EDIT 2:
I meant to comment in the above that I'm very pleased to see that the Nerd Kit doesn't try to abstract away most stuff like the Arduino kits do.  ""Just magically working"" is fine when you want to bang something out and don't want to know how it works, but in terms of microcontroller erudition nothing beats having to bootstrap yourself.",1254854520

That's a class distinction so worthless I'd say you should discard it; it's just people, talking, as silly a classification as ""phoners"". You want to talk entirely about journalism, then go pressure the rule makers to limit this to journalism. (The fact that you can't work out a definition of journalism, which you allude to, is your problem as someone who wants to regulate it, not mine. I'm underwhelmed by the need for this law even in old media.)<p>Meanwhile, a Facebook user who doesn't give a shit about whether you consider them a ""blogger"" and wouldn't know what an ""A-list"" was if you hit them with it, and ultimately isn't worth your derision for the mere fact that someone somewhere thinks it should be called ""blogging"" instead of just ""talking"", is going to incur liabilities for a crime they have no reason to believe is a crime. Again, this law isn't limiting itself to ""journalism"" anywhere that I can see. (I say ""liability"" because clearly the government is not going to be able to perfectly enforce this, but I consider a poorly-enforced bad law worse than a well-enforced one; a democracy has ways of dealing with the latter.)<p>Letting someone split your world into ""bloggers"" and ""nonbloggers"" is a terrible move. It's just people, talking. Some use the phone, some talk over the air, some post comments on Hacker News.

The job had nothing to do with game development (though I later went on to build a 3D data visualization in DirectX that was a cornerstone of the software), but the people who hired me had the same mindset as this article.<p>The idea is based on a few aspects that game developers almost universally share: they are trained to think of new, innovative ways to solve problems since each new game has to push the boundaries of what was possible before, they tend to be passionate about development and doing cool things with code, they are hardcore about optimization, and they are used to constantly learning new technologies and algorithms.<p>That said, not all aspects of game development are ideal for other projects, especially on the web.  As others have mentioned, web development requires a very different mindset than game development.  One major example is that game developers often build components from scratch, rather than re-using existing ones. One of the hardest skill for me to learn was to avoid ""reinventing the wheel"" and using pre-made off the shelf and open source components in projects.<p>I am definitely biased, but my own experiences have caused me to pay more attention to resumes I get that list game development experience, but not to the point of excluding others.",1254853816

Clearly, if you disallow factory labor but allow truancy and neglect, children demonstrably become garbage dump scavengers. At some point you need to have the political will to decisively address child welfare and education, rather than allocating rupiah to cronies and paramilitaries.<p>That the complete solution to this problem involves more than simply outlawing child labor doesn't mean that outlawing child labor is itself ineffective. There are child labor problems in economies that can otherwise provide for children --- even if you have a stable economy, you still need the rule of law.<p>Finally, it seems hollow to argue that, after 70+ years of regulation of child labor, repealing child labor laws would not change the facts of child labor on the ground in the US. While the economy certainly has more to do with the end of child labor than the law does, the law still plays a significant part. As a society, we've eliminated child labor and adapted to that circumstance. That is, at least in part, a victory of child labor prohibition.<p>To say that child labor is simply an artifact of outmoded manufacturing practices misses the fact that plenty of modern companies do engage in child labor, in jurisdictions that allow it.<p>At any rate, you can have the last word, because this conversation is devolving. I think the idea that society can get along just fine on 10, 100, or even 1000 laws is naive; child labor is a simple example, but I could come up with many more vivid examples as well --- for instance, the fact that marital rape has only been addressed within the last century or so.",1254853592

Historically speaking, Glass-Steagall was one (actually two technically speaking) of the most effective bills passed in the past hundred years. It was written in the wake of the stock market crash by people who were determined to make sure that such a calamity did not reoccur, attacking a systematic problem with the financial market at its root cause. I contest that the other regulations you refer to tend to be far less significant and effective, likely (though I may have my work cut out for me substantiating this) because the legislation treats symptoms rather than basic issues.<p>Additionally the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 that removed the last vestiges of Glass-Steagall (the parts that are related to this argument) happened under Clinton. The trend of financial market deregulation started in 1980, due to a shifting tide in economic though in the neoclassical (chicago school) vein and a multi million dollar banking lobby.",1254852400

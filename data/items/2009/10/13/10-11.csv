I think this is a great idea, and I think you should ignore all of the reasons not to do it.  There are only a couple of things you need to be fairly certain of- 1) are there enough young entrepreneurs in the area to make this worthwhile, and 2) do you have the skills and time to make this happen.  You may want to consider raising some money from local rich people and a small board of experts who can help make this happen. I think it's an awesome idea.",1255431146

If you would want to see which of several processes wins at creating a file, just use\nif(-1 != (fd=open(""filename"",0666,O_CREAT|O_EXCL)){ .. }\nwhich is guaranteed to suceed only for one program.\nOr you'd open it without O_EXCL and try locking it. Creating several file and atomically renaming it ""over"" the old file yields you nothing, because whenver you try to access it afterwards, you have no guarantee that it's not being overwritten just afterwards by another one of the processes.",1255431057

878795,comment,873413,873802,0,0,ramchip,,,"> I also don't understand why you can't automate things like saving and restoring settings.<p>Because of C++ :)\nMore seriously, it's the actual design of the options screen. Different variables are hooked to different controls, and I have to make sure that eg. when a frequency (in Hz) is loaded from the registry, it is converted to GHz and the control is set to the appropriate value. Little things like this. I use Qt which is very good and abstracts the actual registry/config file access, but it cannot guess things for me.<p>GUI design isn't always easy and boring, but I work on physics data acquisition apps that have 2 or 3 users in total, so literally nobody cares about the UI as long as the experiment data is fine. It could take 10 minutes to figure out the controls and the user would still be happy. Physicists are used to making and using GUIs that would make you <i>weep</i>!<p>In my case the GUI is a very easy to solve problem compared to the rest of the code. Of course things would be different if I made an app with millions of users, a web app, etc.",1255430896

It was depressing & important for several reasons. I keep asking myself: ""what if i called the broker earlier, just a day before? Could i have the chance to rent the house?"" Well, i might be act earlier but i didn't know about the house earlier, the reason that i didn't know, well i had to do something that day..and this goes and goes and goes...Its like the Feyman video that i watched from here, some very simple things can branches into very complicated and sophisticated manners. \nThis also partly mentioned in the funeral monologue from Synecdoche, NY <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9PzSNy3xj0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9PzSNy3xj0</a>",1255430649

What that means is that the winner will eat all the pie, and it will be difficult to survive, nevertheless prosper, as number 2. The desktop OS market comes to mind. There isn't and there will never be a second place commercial OS. The market is structured like that. Note that Mac OS, even if superficially a desktop OS, is actually in a different market segment, where it is actually well protected and the segment leader.

    information gathered via surveillance programs to 
    coerce/blackmail democratically leaders of other countries

5961105,comment,5959020,5961046,2,0,richardofyork,,,"Good question:
I take it you are referring to the code below. The reason str is garbage collected is because of the modern implementation of the JS compiler in Chrome. Such modern JS compilers look specifically for such unused variables in closures, even when the variable is in the execution context of the closure.<p>To clarify, it is Chrome&#x27;s decision to garbage collect the str variable in that context that resulted in str being garbage collected. It is not a result of a JavaScript bug.<p>Moreover, different browsers have different implementations for how they garbage collect variables in closures&#x27; scope chain. Heck, browsers do their own thing when it comes to many aspects of JavaScript.<p>On second thought (from our previous back and forth), you are correct that I did not explicitly discuss this specific issue in my earlier post. So you win :) and I have up-voted your two comments accordingly.<p>Here is the code I think you are referring to:
var run = function () {
  var str = new Array(1000000).join(&#x27;*&#x27;);
  var logIt = function () {
    console.log(&#x27;interval&#x27;);

  Putting these points together, we can tolerate non-free

  be loaded, it can&#x27;t take control of the main computer,

US invasion on Iraq would trigger a civil war and sectarian violence.
US meddling in Libya would result in unstable country.
Egypt election of islamist leader would result into more persecution for minorities.<p>Something I am right now 100% sure: rebels winning Syrian civil war will result into lots of sectarian violence in Syria and countries around it, and will result into millions of displaced Christians (no wonder most Christians still in Syria are fighting for Assad...)<p>Things where I &quot;failed&quot; was mostly underestimating time to something happen (I 5 years ago, I believed Brazil would take 10 years to have birth rates below replacement...

For example before the protests the chance for a military coup was almost 0%, now it is not so, because there is popular support, and members of the military (including a general) voiced they DO wish to get rid of the current government (or &quot;un-government&quot; as the general wrote on his public letter)

It also doesn&#x27;t have the over-engineering culture that Java has (aside from a number of &quot;Enterprise-Class&quot; add-on libraries Microsoft has tried to push out.)<p>The same could be said about Ruby and it&#x27;s relationship to Perl and Python. It has cultural roots in those languages, but is often regarded to be better rather than worse. (As a die-hard Perl developer I disagree, but I don&#x27;t hold a grudge.) All three are also considered to be C-like languages too, and they don&#x27;t suffer the problems Java has.<p>One could argue that Java&#x27;s problem was that it was designed for programming VCRs, DVD players, and Cable-TV boxes, and similar equipment, but the got stretched and pulled into environments it just wasn&#x27;t ready for. That, plus Sun&#x27;s hyper-aggressive marketing machine to turn Java into the language-for-everything, created the beast that it has become.<p>My personal view is that Sun turned Java into a programming language for charge-by-the-hour consultants. The culture of over-engineering exists because it takes a lot more time to design software that way, more time and larger teams to implement software that way, and specialized hard-to-transfer knowledge to maintain that kind of software. This all benefits the consultants and hurts the companies paying for the software to be built, which only makes sense if Sun was intentionally pushing Java that way.",1372466237

Also, as users it is our right to know what the software on a system is doing, and when firmware is locked and proprietary, we don&#x27;t have full disclosure of the activity of the software - not every user out there can reverse engineer or hack their software to determine if their rights are being violated.

Specifically: variables that are not used in ANY closures and where there is no eval in sight can be stored outside of the lexical environment. This is great, and better than many similar programming language environments offer.<p>It just would be even better if they went one step farther.",1372464812

5961008,comment,5959020,5959830,1,0,Someone,,,"My $0.02 regarding terminology that may help this discussion: what you call a scope is, in Lisp terms, a (lexical) environment: something that, given a name, can give you a value or a &quot;I don&#x27;t know an object with that name&quot; error, and that you can give a (name,value) pair (a <i>binding</i>) to create (languages vary a bit in the way they handle the case where the name already is known)<p>In many languages, environments are nested. For example, in the example:<p><pre><code>  var a = function() {
    var y = &quot;bar&quot;;
    var z = &quot;foo&quot;;
    window.getz = function() { return z; };
    
    var b = function() {
      window.bb = function() { z = y; };
    };
    
    var c = function() {
      window.cc = function() { z = y; };
    };

    var d = function() {
      var q = 42;
      window.dd = function() { z = q; };
    };

    b();
    c();
    d();
  };
  a()
</code></pre>
Calling b, c, and d creates three environments. The environment created by calling d adds a binding of q to 42 to its environment; neither the one created by calling b nor the one created by calling c add bindings of its own, but conceptually, these two have their own environment. All three build on the environment of function a; that environment contains bindings for y and z<p>Normally, when leaving a block, the environment created when entering it can be discarded. Here, however, the environments still can be reached after execution of the block has ended; each of those environments becomes (part of) its own closure when the function returns. The closures created by calling c and by calling d are functionally identical because they both build on the same &#x27;parent&#x27; environment and have no bindings of their own, but conceptually, each has its own closure.<p>More, better info at <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LexicalClosure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LexicalClosure</a> and, of course, in SICP, section 3.2 &quot;The Environment Model of Evaluation&quot; (although I remember seeing clearer pictures for that that involve making closures.

While nothing North of Menlo Park or in Alameda county is part of the &quot;Silicon Valley,&quot; the latter is just a PR term. Tech companies are densest from SF down to San Jose. &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; is neither a distinct geographical nor an economic unit.<p>There are some &quot;sociological&quot; differences across areas in that range with respect to the types of the companies and types of employees. Ignoring those trends to cause staffing problems, e.g. building a new consumer web company in South is rather hard, while trying to start a new semiconductor company in SF would be challenging to say the least. Many people immigrate here without understanding that, and problems ensue.<p>The &quot;San Francisco Bay Area&quot; is a large and diverse region with a population of roughly 6 million. About 10% of those people are directly involved at tech companies, and about 5% are the hard-to-find developers, product managers, testers, etc. Sadly this one minority sector of the economic absolutely dominates most sub-regions here, and it&#x27;s economic power is so much greater than all the other people together, that a host of problems arise.<p>The presence of the bay and the surrounding hills also kinds of screws things up.  Space is limited, and travel between certain areas can be time-consuming. If you consider that roughly 1/3 of the people currently residing in the Bay Area currently are not from here originally, then throw in the vast economic changes tech caused over the last 30 years, you can start to appreciate that maybe long-term planning for the present state wasn&#x27;t quite manageable.<p>In any event, the rhetoric about &quot;sovereignty&quot; and its similes is always self-serving and posturing. Decentralization of tech, or the decentralization of L.A.&#x27;s entertainment industry for that matter, would be a boon to everyone. Only self-important people who want to believe that their region or state or country or village is the center of the freaking universe fail to accept that. It would be better for everyone if the Bay Area were simply one of a set of 20 or so equally large and vibrant centers of tech.",1372464637

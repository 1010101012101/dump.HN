Starting out with 5 paragraphs of a hyperbolic and fluffy rant when you're criticising another company for having a cluttered site is insane. What ever happened to bottom line up front?<p>Dustin did a great redesign, then wrote the article seemingly based on the premise that he had built in credibility. What else explains the wall of self indulgent text, basically celebrating his victory over the AA designers before it's even been established? If I know who he is and I stopped reading, who in American Airlines is going to get to the bottom?<p>I don't know, maybe I overreacted, but I did tell the truth about closing the tab. I didn't make it to the redesign the first time I looked at the page, and the snarky remark wasn't to get points, it was more made out of disgust.

614746,comment,614698,614698,0,0,10ren,,,"<i>c) None, just get it out there</i><p>At first I thought you were doing a patent search to apply for a patent - which makes sense. But on rereading, I think you're just checking to be sure that you're not infringing on anyone else's patents. I agree with your IP friend: if you're not going to patent your invention - there's no point searching at all (and there's even the risk of triple punitive damages in some jurisdictions, as sgrove noted.)<p>If you infringe on someone's patent (and they care), you can probably code around it. But unless you are competing directly with their product, they won't care.  Here's pg's take on it:<p><i>What does that mean in practice? We tell the startups we fund not to worry about infringing patents, because startups rarely get sued for patent infringement. There are only two reasons someone might sue you: for money, or to prevent you from competing with them. Startups are too poor to be worth suing for money. And in practice they don't seem to get sued much by competitors, either. They don't get sued by other startups because (a) patent suits are an expensive distraction, and (b) since the other startups are as young as they are, their patents probably haven't issued yet. [3] Nor do startups, at least in the software business, seem to get sued much by established competitors. Despite all the patents Microsoft holds, I don't know of an instance where they sued a startup for patent infringement. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle don't win by winning lawsuits. That's too uncertain. They win by locking competitors out of their sales channels. If you do manage to threaten them, they're more likely to buy you than sue you.</i> <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html</a>",1242643942

614735,comment,614703,614703,0,0,jrockway,,,"Disclaimer: AA is one of my favorite companies to deal with, so perhaps I am being too nice to them.<p>FWIW, I think this is BS.  AA's website is not wonderful, but it's not hard to use.  I book about 50,000 miles worth of travel a year there, and each trip only takes me a few minutes.  My only complaint is that it won't remember my password.<p>He also complains about the business model, with ""ruby, sapphire, and emerald"" and ""economy, business, and first"" classes.  This is how the legacy carriers work.  They have three-class longhaul flights, and yes, you have to pick which class of service you want.  They are also a member of an airline alliance, complicating things a bit (""ruby, sapphire, and emerald"" are not AA's elite status, but rather the elite statuses that are recognized by oneworld, the alliance they're in).  (He neglects to mention AA's own elite levels, which is odd -- the only place that you see notes about status is during seat selection, and they use AA's terms for the status [Gold, Plat, Exec Plat], not the oneworld terms.)<p>This complexity is why I fly AA nearly exclusively.  Since I fly them a lot, I get various privileges (free domestic upgrades, lounge access when travelling internationally, all the BS fees waived, etc.).  The complexity that being a member of an airline alliance entails means that I get to earn miles (and status) by flying BA in Europe, JAL to Japan, etc.  When I have enough miles, I can redeem them for something worthwhile, like a $14,000 first-class ticket.  (On the ""less-complex"" carriers, the best thing you can get with ""miles"" is a domestic economy ticket.  ""Yay."")<p>Anyway, I don't think this guy knows much about flying.  Perhaps AA's website could better educate him... but most of these things have nothing to do with the webiste.  If you don't care about the specific benefits of flying AA, just use a fare comparison site and pick the lowest fare.  If you do care about AA's benefits, read the documentation on their site.  Either way, I don't think the website or the legacy-carrier business model is harming the shareholders.",1242643632

Danish is really to small a language for specialized domains.  When I write about my work, I use English, as the majority of people who might potentially be interested are from outside Denmark, and those Danes that might be interested can all read English.  A generation ago similar texts would likely be in Danish, but a generation ago there was far less international collaboration.<p>[ Domain loss in Denmark is nothing new, Latin, French and German have all been dominating various domains earlier.

It's like your credit rating. It doesn't matter how much you have out in credit but how you are determined as a risk. Someone with 10k in debt but a credit score of 780 is going to find it much easier than someone with no debt and no credit score. You are a known quantity, there is a number slapped on your file. The other guy is an unknown quantity, he doesn't have a history of payments so they perceive him as a lot riskier.<p>The mortgage bundles work the same way. The banks told the agencies that there are a certain quantity of A loans, B loans, and C loans. Based on that information the bundles were given a rating.<p>Well what happened is those A loans turned into D loans when they were unable to make payments. Then as the investors started asking for more information they found some people weren't being honest. Now the bank is stuck with these shitty assets and they are unable to lend money because it's  tied up in junk.<p>All of this is just my opinion as a financial outsider.",1242642326

He ended up telling me that it can actually be dangerous to be too exhaustive in your research. You want to do a general search of a few databases of your <i>general</i> idea, but if you're very concerned about the idea you'll need to sanitize it by have someone else look and inform you if they find anything that's <i>specifically</i> applies to you.<p>If you find something that might apply to you, and it could be shown that you knew of the patent before you started (e.g. you told potential investors ""There are only a few patents that could hold us up, like...[blah]...but we're confident it doesn't apply to us"" and continued to try to monetize it, you could be up for punitive damages. Painful indeed.<p>Have a knowledgeable friend who you trust and would look out for you do the searching. They'll probably put in just the right amount of time - quite a bit, because they care about you, but not so much that it would impact them too much - and you're free to claim ignorance if anything comes up later.<p>If anyone knows anything wrong with this advice, it would be great to knock some sense into me at this point!",1242642054

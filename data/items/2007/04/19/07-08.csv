I could have said it more gently I suppose.<p>",1176969363

Godavari (formerly Sue's Indian Cuisine) on Castro St is also very good, and more reasonably priced. I've only been there for their lunch buffet ($10).<p>I'm pretty picky when it comes to Indian food because I'm ethnically Indian and I benchmark the restaurants against mom-cooked meals. :)<p>Castro St has a bunch of other good restaurants, and a number of crappy ones too.",1176969210

I had a lot of fun drinking beer (Old Rasputin Imperial Russian Stout and Stone IPA 4tw) and geeking out with fellow programmers. I met a Google millionaire who was developing his own Lisp dialect with Pythonic features, and had a long discussion with another guy about cache performance problems caused by smart pointers that use atomic refcounting.<p>May have been skewed by the fact the only one I've been to was on the evening following Startup School, but I was told that all of the SHDH events have about the same turnout.",1176968389

One thing you can do with a box like this is, while you're ramping up and don't use the full capacity, share it with a friend.",1176967417
14515,comment,14438,14446,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Nope, sorry but that's just wrong and totally unhelpful. <p>Asking for advice from peers who are actively involved in what you want to do is a great idea.<p>Since you are early in your dev career, I would highly recommend finding an existing startup to join with more experienced developers and learning from them - both what they do wrong and what they do right. Hopefully more of the latter ;)<p>When I left my first bay area job I almost did my own startup at that point. However, when I was honest with myself, I realized I wasn't ready to do it alone and needed a team. So I looked around and applied at several startups. I felt great about one particular startup where the founder was super-smart in business, but also very mature and kind. I don't think I ever saw him get upset or show the least unkindness during the whole startup phase. And he had plenty to be frustrated with, believe me. Anyway, I learned a ton of good and bad through that experience and the company was acquired by Intuit for $60 million. I was really lucky in that regard. Most startups will not have an exit so quick or so profitable.<p>So that's my recommendation based on my limited experience. Good luck!",1176967196

Uh, millions of dollars that they could have used to just acquire Alexaholic. They would have gained good-will, great press, and a great developer already passionate about their product. <p>What a huge blunder - sad to see, especially since they're so innovative in other areas.",1176966311

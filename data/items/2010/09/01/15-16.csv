We're working on our marketing pages now and we're not sure if it's better to ask for credit card details at signup or sometime after the trial expires. We know a lot of companies, like 37signals, ask at signup, but we don't have a free plan (for more on that, see here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1615416) and only offer the trial.

(I fix these problems and other stuff for a living).<p>There are short answers and long answers to this problem.<p>The short answers try to fix quickly what the most likely cause of the problem is. If a server is being unresponsive this is most likely because the server runs out of memory or incurs in heavy disk I/O. For the memory problem find what are the processes eating up the memory. For apache lowering the MaxClients/MaxServers/KeepAlive helps. For I/O you'll have to look at the database (see error log, log long queries etc).<p>But that's speculation.<p>The proper way to fix the issue is to understand what's really causing it. A way to start is getting meaningful server utilization data and reviewing logs.<p>Spend a few minutes installing a graphical monitoring tool like munin or google's quicklook (I like these because they are lightweight, there's a ton of them like cacti etc). In a couple of hours you'll get a better picture of what's going on.<p>Review the logs, specially error logs.<p>I use a little script that runs every 15 mins and logs the most important stuff that is going on in the server, you can run something similar every 5 mins or whatever to find what's really going on: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/Qv0J3WHY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/Qv0J3WHY</a><p>Another tip is to set up a mirror test/stage server and benchmark the heck out of it; you don't want to make a lot of changes live in a production server.<p>I guess you can also ask the support people at Slicehost.<p>I'll gladly take a look at your server for up to 30 mins at no cost.",1283356566

Its like giving off potential competitors some of your chips, not realizing that those chips might enable your competitors to get more chips in the future, enough to give you more serious competition.<p>But at the same time, the solution he suggests could backfire very badly. If it were a case where the US was the only technology leader, then protectionism could have been possibly used to re-establish local manufacturing. But thats not the case, there are competitiors there too, japan, Korea, Taiwan, not to mention China.<p>If the US does resort to protectionism, it would put at stake the massive revenues that american companies are getting from foreign markets. For many of the top American companies, the foreign markets are the fastest growing markets and in many, they have started being more than 50% of revenues.<p>The moment American companies start being 'idealistic' or the government starts protectionistic, that would set american companies at a massive disadvantage in foreigh markets. Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese and Chinese companies would be more than willing to take advantage of those disadvantages that American companies would face.<p>The evntual losers would be the investors in American companeis, that includes the multitudes of Americans who invest in them through pension funds, mutual funds, 401s, etc. Of course, they will lose in other wasy if they keep losing the manufacturing jobs too.<p>This is like a highly complex Game theory scenario with multiple players, multiple possible strategic moves, with  gains and losses for each move. A simplistic or idealistic answer would not solve it<p>I think what the Gates foundation is doing, spending on education to increase the supply of more highly qualified people within the US, in the future, is definitely a move in the right direction.<p>As for Grove, I think he is just doing his best to serve his masters the best. Earlier his masters were the investors in Intel, so he was making sure that it was profitable and keeps surviving. Now, that he no longer has to serve those previous masters, he has decided to serve his primary master, the USA of which he is a citizen<p>(Please note, my use of the words 'masters' and 'serving' is not meant to be derogatory, he is just doing his patriotic duty now that there is no conflict with his corporate duties. I am not going to judge him based on that, life is not black and white, and he still remains very high in my list of idols.)",1283354856

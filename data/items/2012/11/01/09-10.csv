4726831,comment,4725924,4726187,2,0,robk,,,"Any mass-scale business that is required to hold customers on their premises for hours at a time in a space-confined area is always going to be challenged with customer service.  Combined with the modern consumer who is taught they're always right, and it's a recipe for dissatisfaction.\nI travel a ton for work and have learned to let things roll off my back.  Yet when I travel with friends and family, they will always find something dissatisfying, even if it's on a car trip.  Nasty bathrooms at a rest stop, a missed exit, etc. are no different than a flight.  When 99% of things go right and you travel at 800mph for hundreds of miles for less than a hundred bucks, people let inferior coffee ruin the entire trip for them.  God forbid the complexity added by doing it with a few hundred other people.",1351763959

4726828,comment,4723249,4725661,3,0,alexkus,,,"Sure, it's nothing special, it's a Robot Arena type programming game. Yes there are lots of them about (that have existed for many years), but I'm trying to remain as faithful as I can to a version (by SPA Publishing) that appeared on the RM 380Z/480Z machines back in the late 80's. The robots were programmed in a LOGO style language (I still have photocopies of the manuals somewhere). All of this was going to be open source (if I'd released it earlier I'd be able to find a backup!).<p>Rather than implement a LOGO interpreter I wanted to do it a slightly different way to learn some useful stuff along the way, so I decided to implement robots as a program running on a virtual CPU. I designed an instruction set and corresponding assembly language, wrote a processing engine that could run multiple robot programs at once, wrote an assembler to go from assembly to compiled robots.  Next on my list was a compiler that would do LOGO -> robot assembly.<p>There was a strong ARM/RISC influence to the instruction set/assembly language as I'd been using Acorn Archimedes machines at college in the early 90's.<p>I then built a control system on top of the game engine that would run all of the robots against each other in all combinations and provide a league table of which robot came out best. The end goal was to stick it all on a website and allow people to submit their own robots and see where they came in the league table. They'd also be a discussion forum on programming tips/tricks, and for people to write compilers that would take other languages as produce appropriate assembly language.<p>I definitely learned a lot whilst doing it first time. One of the assignments in my first year at University (Comp Sci) was to design an instruction set for a basic CPU that would be able to be programmed to perform a certain bunch of tasks. It's quite easy when you've got programming experience in Z80, 6502, 68000, x86 and ARM, and you've designed/implemented at least one of your own already.<p>Other things I remember that were useful were writing my own PRNG (there was an instruction to get a random number) so that I could have individual PRNGs for each robot (and the game engine) all derived from a single 'game' seed number which made each game (with random starting positions) deterministic and repeatable.<p>Creating a two-stage assembler (thanks to years of typing ""FOR loop% = 0 TO 3 STEP 3"", ""[ OPT %loop"", etc), compiler design (for LOGO -> assembly), maths for doing intersection of two lines, intersection of a line and a circle, integer instructions, floating point instructions (and implementing this in a portable way), etc.<p>In '94 I'd hacked both an X GUI and a linux SVGAlib interface onto it so you could watch the games play out. Later on I'd even came up with a dissertation proposal that used it as a fitness function for robots created by genetic algorithms but decided against it after discussion with the tutor (no less than Dr Noel Sharkey who later sat as a judge on the UK TV version of Robot Wars).<p>I may finish it one day, and 10 people may remember the game and be interested in writing robots for it, but that bit doesn't matter one bit. It's my side project and I kind of enjoy doing it (or even just thinking about it) probably more than the feeling I'd get if it was finished and done.",1351763815

However, given that supply is ""hard coded"" in the algorithm, supply is more or less a constant variable. That leaves demand.<p>Demand is there as long as Bitcoin has transactional value (how many people accept it as a form of payment) and asset value (how attractive it is as a store of value). Bitcoin has price floors as long as it is useful in transactions (for example, as long as online black markets like Silk Road flourish) and as long as Bitcoin ""enthusiasts"" accept it as an asset.<p>Barring some way for the government to thwart the TOR + Bitcoin combo for making anonymous online transactions, I would think that any volatility in the BTC-USD exchange rate would come from volatility in the value of the dollar over that of BTC.",1351763555

Using exceptions for control flow is widely accepted as a code smell.<p>Unless using exceptions either hinders performance(they are expensive but I am yet to see a case where it matters), or makes the control flow incomprehensible, it doesn't matter what is widely accepted. I need a reason for ""don't use exceptions because..."", and ""exceptions for exceptional conditions"" or ""just because it's widely accepted"" doesn't cut it.<p>I am pretty sure you have very strong opinions about goto as well, which I use a lot when using C. It's simply the cleanest way to directly jump to the cleaner instead of convoluting the flow with non-needed flags. Since you are placing much weight on what others deem acceptable, you can look at linux kernel code and Steven's code in Unix Network Programming.<p>Also, exceptions are control flow in every sense of the word, though non-local <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Exceptions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Exceptions</a>. I don't know where the notion of exceptions not being control flow came from. Among other examples of exceptions for control flow, Python and Ruby raise StopIteration in their iteration protocol. And in Python, exceptions aren't that much costly.",1351762092

Their existing plant is probably worth 5-10x that even at bankruptcy auction prices.<p>My understanding (although I haven't looked in too much depth) is that they're an established company doing work in one area (fabrication for plasma/fusion research) who have come up with a novel use for some of their tech/skills, but can't really justify the cost/opportunity cost of this particular app.<p>So they're asking for essentially donations to develop the thing, in exchange for very low-cost returns plus a final project demo.  It's really the patronage model applied to research.<p>Also, for 10k you do get naming rights to the tech, and some advertising opportunity during the final tech demo, which is probably valuable to some companies, especially given the audience targeting this thing is likely to attract.<p>Pitching for equity investment in the company requires a much more substantial business plan (""Make cool thing, produce internet videos & some research data"" isn't really going to work), and it may just be that they don't see the value right now in doing the work necessary to attract those sorts of investors.<p>I imagine if this test is successful and there is any hint of actual commercial prospects from existing satellite/space manufacturers, they'd take a more conventional route to funding to get the thing built.<p>For ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if...?"" studies, I think this is a good way to go about it, and $40k of people already agree.",1351761376

I figured how to do elastic servers by hacking around, but the other services are still beyond me, especially which ones I need and how to connect them to each other.  I&#x27;ve read lots of stack exchange posts on how to do various subtasks like installing an SVN server, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying to read a coherent presentation introducing the most relevant AWS services for my needs.<p>If you know of a thorough introduction to the use, caveats and good practices on AWS through stackexchange, please let this author know.  So far I have only found thousands of Q & A, which is like eating ice cream with tweezers.<p>As far as OP goes, try to find folks like me who are starting small/home office businesses in niche markets and make your book part of a larger bundle of educational material on things like mailchimp, Quickbooks, etc.  Also, typical marketing for products like this is to give away the first chapter for free.<p>Also, find blogs of people whose readers could use your ebook and write them each a personalized email saying quite simply, &quot;I made this book.  I think your readers might like it&quot; and let them decide if they feel like writing about it.  You&#x27;d be surprised how many influential people you can reach in 4-12 hours of searching for blogs and writing.  Good luck!  Also,<p>I see you link to menutail in your Profile.  Get a link to your gumroad up there, pronto!  Get it in your sig and in your email, too.<p>Also, start a blog in which you handle a new topic from the book in introductory depth each week.  Venkatesh Rao did a good job promoting _Tempo_ this way and it can add value to the original material long after the publishing.",1371877093

But the follow on designs (Mig-15 et al) were in service for quite some time after the war. The rate of advance of German industry despite massive aerial assault and savage ground wars is fascinating. I recommend reading Gitta Sereny&#x27;s biography of Albert Speer. Among other rather less impressive acts (extent debated, but likely involvement in genocide, definitely involved in slave labour organisation etc) he rearranged German industry such the production increases were occurring right up until the very final stages of the war.

In what meaningful way has anyone chosen a democratic process? I certainly never chose it, and I&#x27;ve never been asked if I approve. I am occasionally given the &quot;opportunity&quot; to vote for one of a few candidates for various political offices, and there are sometimes even referenda, but I have no choice in <i>the fact that this is how our government operates</i>. If this were a dictatorship (as in, a single ruler has all government authority), would you also say that &quot;we&#x27;ve chosen a dictatorship&quot;?<p>You say that the democratic process is horrifying, and I agree, but I disagree that the people being governed have any role in choosing to be governed by this style of government <i>even if</i> we make the contentious assumption that they actually have a voice in the specific decisions the government makes. The &quot;democratic government&quot; that rules us (here, I&#x27;m referring specifically to the United States, but I suspect it holds for all Western democracies) maintains its power through systematic and unapologetic violence against anyone who challenges it, just like any other type of government. Of course, that last sentence is somewhat unnecessary, because that&#x27;s built into the definition of &quot;government.&quot;<p>I also completely disagree with your claim that flawed governments (and indeed governments at all) are a necessary cost of civilization, but that&#x27;s a longer story that I may type when I have something other than an iPad. Suffice it to say that I agree that we should try to fix it, but I&#x27;m convinced that the only way to do so is from the outside. Because governments are by definition organizations which claim to be the sole legitimate purveyors of violence in a region, and claim to be self-policing, I do not believe it makes any sense to attempt to use the political process itself to change or fix them from the inside.",1371875540

Even assuming they can never once pass it unanimously, they&#x27;re still going to renew it every time rather than allowing murder to become legal. Also, an amendment expanding the definition of murder to nontraditional entities is going to get killed if necessary to save the bill, and if the vote on the clean bill isn&#x27;t unanimous then there are going to be Congress Critters who have to explain to their constituents why they voted against prohibiting murder.<p>As I see it the real trouble with this approach is that it encourages Congress to just reauthorize everything without a debate because there are so many laws they don&#x27;t have time to do their jobs thoroughly. And that&#x27;s kind of a different problem -- which is already a problem today, since they should be considering whether laws on the books should be repealed on a regular basis regardless.<p>But if the strongest argument you can make against something is &quot;it might only help a little instead of a lot,&quot; it&#x27;s maybe still the sort of thing we should try.",1371875217

The people you&#x27;re arguing with might be looking at something other than GISS. For instance, here&#x27;s the WoodForTrees index:<p><a href=""http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/wti"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/wti</a><p>the WoodForTrees Index is an average of four popular temperature series. This index was created specifically in order to reduce the need for arguing about which series to use. I believe the current formula is:<p>WTI = mean(GISTEMP-0.35, HADCRUT3VGL-0.26, RSS-0.10, UAH)<p>Playing around with the data sources, it seems like 1998 was an all-time high within the period of the satellite record - <i>not</i> surpassed by &quot;a few years even warmer in the 21st century&quot; - according to three out of four of those.

5922555,comment,5911273,5917710,1,0,graycat,,,"You are too pessimistic.<p>> historical precedent.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of historical precedent
where the US democracy worked.  E.g.,
we passed prohibition -- 2/3rds of
the House, 2/3rds of the Senate, and
3/4ths of the states.  When we saw
how dumb it was, we repealed it.<p>Recently SOPA and PIPA were close to
passing.  A lot of people in the
tech community raised hell, and 
the bills went down in flames.<p>Sure, the Constitution doesn&#x27;t 
solve all the problems.  Instead,
as Jefferson said,<p>&quot;The price of liberty is eternal
vigilance.&quot;<p>So, to make the Constitution work,
citizens have to keep pushing.
You mentioned threats, and there
are threats, but they can be defeated.<p>Once public opinion polls rise
significantly over 50%, politicians
start to pay close attention.<p>The main issue, then, is just what
the voters want.  Sure, the MSM,
political ad campaigns, lying 
politicians, etc. can have 
big effects, but in the end
the voters know a lot about
lying, duplicity, manipulation,
etc.  I believe that the Internet
will be helping -- it seems to
have helped a lot with SOPA and
PIPA and to have gotten the
Snowden efforts front and center.
No doubt some cases are on the
way to the Supreme Court --
from Google, EFF, ACLU, etc.
I doubt that the Patriot Act
will come out whole.<p>Indeed, I believe that YouTube
is helping a lot:  Once a politician
gives a speech, then due to YouTube
the politician can&#x27;t assume that
the voters will easily forget.
And for text data on politics, the
Google/Bing keywork/phrase search
engines are terrific.<p>Look at the US efforts in Viet Nam:
Before WWII, Viet Nam was a 
colony of France.  Ho Chi Minh
was a dishwasher in Paris!<p>During WWII, Japan made Viet Nam
a colony.  The US worked with
the Viet Namese &#x27;nationalists&#x27;,
e.g., to rescue downed US
pilots.<p>After WWII, the French got 
one of the peace conferences to
let them back into Viet Nam,
and war broke out.<p>Then the US had just fought against
the Axis of Germany, Italy, and
Japan, and it looked like there
was another axis on the way with
Moscow, Peking, and Hanoi.
So, the US helped France in
Viet Nam.  The French lost.<p>By then the US had been fighting
in Korea:  The North was backed
by Moscow and Peking and wanted
the whole country.  The US and
parts of the UN wanted to 
&#x27;block&#x27; that effort.  So,
there was the war in Korea,
really, still simmering.<p>So, when the French lost in
Viet Nam, the US wanted
to divide the country
and have the southern half
allied with the US.<p>Alas, whatever the Ho government
was, it was able to maintain
power.  And the US couldn&#x27;t
find a government to back
in Saigon that could maintain
power -- a Saigon politician
did not dare sleep in a
small village in the South.<p>So, the US kept backing 
governments in Saigon 
that kept losing.<p>In the US, the foreign policy
&#x27;wise men&#x27;, Keenan, Dulles,
Rusk, Bundy, etc. kept screaming
that the US had to stop Hanoi
or &quot;dominoes&quot; would fall all
across the Pacific and land
in California or some such.
LBJ and Nixon really bought 
into this stuff, big time.<p>So the US bent itself all out of
shape, inflated its economy,
lost the lives of 50,000+
US soldiers, etc. trying to
prop up loser governments in
Saigon.<p>Why?  Because no US politician
wanted to see Hanoi take Saigon
and, then, suffer the charges
that they &quot;lost Viet Nam&quot; and
were &quot;soft on the atheistic, international
Communist conspiracy about to
take over the world and
march into Washington, DC&quot;.
That sales pitch worked really
well in the US from the end of
WWII until the US finally
was run out of Viet Nam with
people hanging off the 
parts of US helicopters
whenever it was in the 1970s.<p>In all of this, it was really sad
that Ho worked so hard to
go to Moscow and Peking and, there,
poke the US.<p>Actually, in the end, Hanoi
and the US really had no serious
differences at all.  Indeed,
now the US couldn&#x27;t be happier
with Hanoi.  The US could have
been happy with Ho and Hanoi
at any time from WWII until
the US totally lost.<p>But for your point about US
democracy, what finally got the
US out of Viet Nam was
the US voters, e.g., 
many thousands of them
marching on DC.  Finally they
made such a big noise that
even President Ford gave only
half-hearted support for staying
in Saigon, and we left.<p>The US voters long bought into
that Rusk, etc. &quot;domino&quot; 
theory.  Eventually nearly
every young person knew
someone in their high school
days who had died in Viet Nam.
The predictions of the hawks
never came true.  It was clear
that somehow the US just did not
know how to build a government
in Saigon.<p>It took US voters a <i>very long
time</i>, decades, to see these points.
But, eventually the voters saw,
and then the US was out&#x27;a there.<p>The bottleneck was the US voters
voting for LBJ and Nixon
instead of, say, McGovern.
I voted for McGovern;
he wanted <i>out</i> as in &#x27;leave
now&#x27; which is eventually just
what we did and what brought us to
the present which is just fine.
But McGovern lost, badly.<p>There were lots of people saying
that we should get the heck out
of Viet Nam.  One book went
&quot;Are not winning, cannot win,
should not wish to win&quot;.  My
view is that we burned enough
oil, say, in B-52s from Guam,
to enable OPEC.<p>We blew it.<p>Then, Afghanistan -- same song,
second verse.  There, still,
no US politician wants to say,
&quot;Leave.  Now.&quot;.  Me?  I&#x27;d
have bombed enough of Akrapistan
to teach them a lesson and then
left, without ever setting a
foot on the ground.<p>The US needs to wise up.",1371874388

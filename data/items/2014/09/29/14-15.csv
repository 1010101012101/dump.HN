8383118,comment,8382124,8382365,11,0,tokenadult,,,"It is of course important to look at whether or not what you are measuring validly predicts what you are trying to predict. Despite much worry about SAT coaching courses, I get the very strong impression that the young people who score highest on the SAT are still, after all these decades, the young people who read widely for fun and who think about math problems for fun, just as they were in the 1970s when young people in my region of the United States were not coached for the SAT at all. The standardized conditions for administering the SAT have always included (in my lifetime) giving students registered for the test access to a complete previously administered test to serve as practice material. According to a psychometrician I know, precisely because the SAT allows everyone to practice in advance, it is an especially valid estimate of the test-taker&#x27;s general ability to learn and to reason.<p>You can look up research about SAT correlations with general intelligence[1] and IQ test scores[2] and college grades[3] (what SAT scores are intended to predict) on Google Scholar and see for yourself what the empirical research says. No one-factor means of predicting college success is perfect (and if college admission officers were forced to use ONE factor to admit applicants to college, the factor they would be wise to choose to predict college grades is UNWEIGHTED high school grade average), but SAT scores (or ACT scores) are still used in the admission process of most colleges that are at all selective because they provide helpful information for comparing applicants who attended different high schools.<p>If you would like to put names of particular researchers into a Google Scholar search to find out what they have discovered about current use of SAT tests, I would suggest Nathan Kuncel or Paul Sackett, both of whom have studied quite a few detailed data sets about SAT-takers and what their scores predict.<p>AFTER EDIT: Terence Tao, in the interview kindly posted to open this thread, makes the important point that sometimes teachers entertain more than they actually teach. (I think a lot of commercial test-prep courses have this defect.) He said, &quot;Sometimes making a class more enjoyable or entertaining is not the same as making it more educational. I remember once when I taught calculus, one of the sections was quadric surfaces, like ellipsoids, paraboloids and so forth. So there’s this thing called a hyperbolic paraboloid, and I wanted to demonstrate this. It turns out that a Pringle has the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid. So I brought in a pack of Pringles to class and said, &#x27;this is a hyperbolic paraboloid, this is what it looks like.&#x27; I ate the Pringle as I was writing equations on the board. Well many years later, I ran into someone on the street who said, &#x27;Oh, I know you. I took one of your classes. I forget what it was, but there was a Pringle.&#x27; So I thought, &#x27;you didn’t remember any of the math, but you remember the Pringle.&#x27; So it didn’t really work.&quot; Following up on that in the context of this subthread, I think a lot of students know who Joe Bloggs[4] is without being able to reason successfully to find the right answer choice on the harder SAT questions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=SAT+general+intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=SAT+general+intell...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=SAT+IQ+test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=SAT+IQ+test</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=SAT+college+grades"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=SAT+college+grades</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=K4SteOicBAQC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=joe+bloggs+principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=K4SteOicBAQC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA...</a>",1412002566

This is critical for applications that have to return close-to-realtime results due to the queried content being time-sensitive.<p>Neither GIN nor GiST indices support such document ordering. For a top-N query of the most recent results, the entire result set has to be processed. With common domain-specific words, this can be more than 50% of the entire document set. As you can imagine, this is insanely expensive. When you are in this situation, it helps to set gin_fuzzy_search_limit to a conservative number (20000 works for me, less if you expect heavy traffic) in postgresql.conf, so that pathological queries eventually finish without processing every result. Result quality will take a hit, because many documents are skipped over.<p>If you need any type of ordered search on more than a hundred thousand documents, do yourself a favor and use something else than Postgres.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what search back-end Wikipedia is using, but it seems like they are not quite immune to this problem either: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=a+the"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=a+the</a>",1412001913

The price of the Model T, Ford&#x27;s mainstay product, had been successively cut over the years while the cost of the workers had dramatically, and quite publicly, increased. The company&#x27;s president and majority stockholder, Henry Ford, sought to end special dividends for shareholders in favor of massive investments in new plants that would enable Ford to dramatically increase production, and the number of people employed at his plants, while continuing to cut the costs and prices of his cars. In public defense of this strategy, Ford declared:<p>> “My ambition is to employ still more men, to spread the benefits of this industrial system to the greatest possible number, to help them build up their lives and their homes. To do this we are putting the greatest share of our profits back in the business.\t”<p>> While Ford may have believed that such a strategy might be in the long-term benefit of the company, he told his fellow shareholders that the value of this strategy to them was not a primary consideration in his plans. The minority shareholders objected to this strategy, demanding that Ford stop reducing his prices when they could barely fill orders for cars and to continue to pay out special dividends from the capital surplus in lieu of his proposed plant investments. Two brothers, John Francis Dodge and Horace Elgin Dodge, owned 10% of the company, among the largest shareholders next to Ford.<p>I don&#x27;t have time to read the actual court documents, so I&#x27;ll assume this is reasonably accurate.<p>It seems Ford was trying to say &quot;screw shareholder value, we&#x27;re doing the right thing because we want to support society.&quot; This was of course a losing argument. But it sounds like the whole problem was the argument. Couldn&#x27;t the argument be &quot;we did the right thing and took a short-term loss, but we believe this is in the company&#x27;s, and by extension the shareholders&#x27;, best interest because [it will create tons of goodwill | it creates tons of good PR for us | whatever]&quot;?",1412001856

The value of a computer with meaningful local storage and execution is that it continues to work when the network is gone or isn&#x27;t performing well. And it takes a lot less bandwidth to send data to a user&#x27;s computer and let local applications worry about dealing with the data than it is to send a full screen to the user, if you&#x27;re talking about GUI. You can also smooth out latency issues a lot easier.<p>So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s obviously better in those cases. But it&#x27;s very obviously worse OUTSIDE of those institutions. Here&#x27;s Pike&#x27;s description of his dream setup[1]:<p>&quot;I want no local storage anywhere near me other than maybe caches. No disks, no state, my world entirely in the network. Storage needs to be backed up and maintained, which should be someone else&#x27;s problem, one I&#x27;m happy to pay to have them solve. Also, storage on one machine means that machine is different from another machine. At Bell Labs we worked in the Unix Room, which had a bunch of machines we called &#x27;terminals&#x27;. Latterly these were mostly PCs, but the key point is that we didn&#x27;t use their disks for anything except caching. The terminal was a computer but we didn&#x27;t compute on it; computing was done in the computer center. The terminal, even though it had a nice color screen and mouse and network and all that, was just a portal to the real computers in the back. When I left work and went home, I could pick up where I left off, pretty much. My dream setup would drop the &quot;pretty much&quot; qualification from that.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s fine, so long as all you want to do on your home computer is do more work. But that&#x27;s such an incredibly narrow vision of computing. The truly personal computer enabled a lot of things that weren&#x27;t possible under the old dumb terminal model Pike pines for, and has made computers accessible to many more people. We&#x27;ll continue to get some of the benefits of this as the &quot;cloud&quot; continues to be integrated into things, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going back to the &quot;communal&quot; computing model, and if we do, it&#x27;s going to be because someone looks at the benefits of the personal computer model and finds a way to provide them in the communal model, rather than sitting there and pining about how it was in the old days before the peasants ruined everything.<p>1) <a href=""http://rob.pike.usesthis.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rob.pike.usesthis.com/</a>, thanks to tjgq for providing the link below",1412001788

They work similarly to netcat, but without requiring any other malware or supporting tools to be present on the system.  The example above shows how to create an extremely useful reverse shell, just using BASH itself. Through a clever bit of advanced BASH syntax, it calls a second BASH shell, which it then binds to a network socket connected to the attacker’s IP on port 3333.  Because this second shell is called with the ‘-i’ option (for “interactive” mode), it provides full two-way communication to the attacker, operating much as a normal command line shell would.  The attacker has merely to listen on the correct port in order to receive a full interactive shell on the victim system.&quot;<p>Maybe I&#x27;m seeing this wrong, but isn&#x27;t the /dev filesystem provided by the kernel?",1412000873

I could use MySQL or PostGRE, but I&#x27;m opting for something different for the sake something different. I do want to have integrity, though.

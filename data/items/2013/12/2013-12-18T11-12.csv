For one thing, I know plenty of MBAs who learn similar things.<p>But mainly he makes himself look ignorant for not realizing the things MBAs also learn that engineers rarely do. For one example, there are great reasons why many in business learn never to bring engineers to sales meetings or any meetings facing the client. I certainly learned from hard experience of having engineers say completely counterproductive things that harmed relationships that they self-righteously defended that any MBA would know not to.<p>Plenty of great engineers do great in meetings with clients, of course, but then plenty of MBAs learn to code and build things, which, to his detriment, he doesn&#x27;t allow for.<p>To say nothing of the value of division of labor and value of teamwork.<p>> <i>However because most MBAs’ education promotes the concept of extreme specialization, they think they don’t need to learn coding. Approaching a potential partner with little tech knowledge makes you look, kind of like a jerk.</i><p>If his goal is to discourage MBAs from approaching him as a partner, I expect he&#x27;s achieved his goal by calling a group of people he&#x27;s never met jerks for disrespecting things they&#x27;re ignorant about <i>while he does the same thing in the other direction</i>. He seems not to see the value of sensitivity, emotional intelligence, self-awareness, empathy, and so on. Not all MBAs learn such things, but I see that population at least value those things.<p>That he write they &quot;look, kind of like&quot; jerks suggests he hasn&#x27;t read Strunk and White either, which doesn&#x27;t make him look any better.",1387367905

Out of interest, I bought my wife the first aluminium MacBook that would have been released on the same day as his laptop, and that does support Mavericks (because it has Nvidia 9400M graphics, which the next year&#x27;s white MacBook then also got).<p>It&#x27;s a shame those old white Macs (including white C2D iMacs) don&#x27;t support Mavericks, because they are 64-bit capable and generally still reasonable machines. But support has to stop somewhere, I guess, and I wouldn&#x27;t like to be the person writing the 64-bit firmware and drivers for those machines, 6 years later. Also, most of them have got dodgy GPUs thanks to a combination of poor Nvidia parts and all-in-one/ultra-slim designs that got clogged up with dust.<p>FWIW, if you&#x27;re programming for the AppStore (i.e, using these as a professional tool), 5 years of life out of a laptop is actually pretty good (IMVHO).

More efficient? Probably. But when has a business made a fast decision just because something was more efficient?<p>But most likely it is inevitable that fast food will go this route. (Probably not until McDonalds decides to deploy it all across the US), but your statement that at least one &quot;front-end&quot; person is out of a job is not true at all. No one behind the counter is trained only to be a cashier. Pretty much the first thing you do when you work these kinds of jobs is learn how to handle the register because that&#x27;s the most important thing at a restaurant (getting money from a customer).<p>So how many people is this kiosk actually replacing? Who is to say that having these self-serve kiosks won&#x27;t just free them up to do something else like cooking food? If freeing them up allows them to serve more customers to make more money then why would the store fire them?

6927020,comment,6926885,6926885,7,0,tikhonj,,,"This is one of the key ideas that <i>Gödel, Escher, Bach</i> tries to convey accessibly. I&#x27;ve always thought of it like a popular science book, but for logic. Unless you&#x27;re already familiar with the ideas, it&#x27;s a great place to start or even just get a taste. A great read for non-mathematicians.<p>Viewing logic systems as objects themselves is a very important insight and yet surprisingly counter-intuitive. Logic is <i>logic</i>. It feels like the aether of reasoning--constant and ever-present. But in reality, you can easily design and use different systems with different constraints and philosophies, giving you different results. You can even reason logically <i>about</i> logic, considering a logic system as an object itself! I think this sort of realization is one of the most important steps to understanding that elusive &quot;mathematical mindset&quot; people like to talk about.<p>For me, learning all about Curry-Howard and how programming relates to logic really opened my eyes. I&#x27;m already comfortable with treating programming languages and programs as objects--I do all sorts of metaprogramming and static analysis and so on. Seeing proofs and logic systems in the same light made everything clear. A proof is just a program; a logic just a programming language and so I can treat them in the same ways. I really believe Curry-Howard is one of the most important ideas I&#x27;ve ever learned--it gave me a new perspective on CS, a new perspective on mathematics and a way to naturally link the two. Thinking by analogy is very powerful, and Curry-Howard is ultimately just that, a rigorous analogy.<p>As an aside, I think we can reasonably codify induction by talking about probabilities. See &quot;Does Algorithmic Probability Solve the Problem of Induction&quot;[1] which is a great paper that breaks Betteridge&#x27;s law.

Just because they have chosen to project their data onto a sphere doesn&#x27;t mean you have to follow suit... its probably a useful format for meteorologists or cartographers but its not suited for rendering at all.<p>of course doing that will have similar results to a low pass filter unless you use a much higher density grid than the source (since you want a regular grid in your result and have irregular data points) - but visually that is very acceptable as a compromise.<p>the obvious guess suggestion is webgl and a 3d canvas, and dropping any fancy svg or other elements if they need to be visually sycned up with precision and rendering all of it yourself in a single consistent way. in the browser world its often a bad idea to rely on the implementation of anything if you need guarantees of quality - there is a lot of variation and a lot of bugs that have persisted for years on end...<p>i&#x27;d also suggest partitioning the data once its in 3d - a kd-tree or regular octree is quite easy to implement and understand and perfectly suited for this imo",1387365368

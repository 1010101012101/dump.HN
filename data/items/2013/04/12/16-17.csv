5539677,comment,5538845,5538845,3,0,superbeefy,,,"Having NYC style density is one thing, actually supporting it is another. If anyone has used the MUNI light rail system in SF it is plagued with constant delays, breakdowns, inefficient routing, and of all things traffic jams. The light rail is also a hybrid aboveground/underground system, and when above ground is not separated from the motor vehicle traffic, which causes more delays. When underground several lines merge onto one track (bart does this too) this is another pain point.<p>As for bus service thats even worse. One of the original goals of muni was that residences should be within 2 blocks of a MUNI stop. That sounds great on paper, but in reality it makes  trips excruciatingly long. When a bus route has to stop at every other block, or in some cases every block, especially on flat terrain, it exemplifies the absurdities of MUNI's grand plan.",1365785906

No. But then again, Coca-cola nor Pepsi actually bottle their own products so they are measured on brand awareness anyways.<p>2. A friend of mine just started making custom bicycle wheels. He's gotten 3 new customers literally from our triathlon facebook group alone. Also, I would guess at least 5 people (probably way more) have had massages from a sports massage therapist in our club, simply because they posted on our group ""I'm in need of a sports massage who knows a good one?""<p>""Social media"" isn't necessarily a new way of driving business, but rather it's a new platform for capturing something that has been happening for decades - word of mouth - and then trying to position yourself (at scale) to exploit that word of mouth.",1365785878

Yes, some games are art, and almost all games have artistic value. But when I'm playing Quake, I don't care about any of that. All I care about is that it's fun and it's challenging and I'm playing with my friends. Just like when I'm watching the latest summer blockbuster, I don't care that it won't win an Oscar, or that the girl in the plot is really just there to stand around and look pretty, or that the hero is somehow surviving things that no human could withstand. It's fun.<p>I could go through Ico with this post and glean a lot from it. Taking the same thing to Battlefield 3 might yield substantially different results. I personally don't care.

Pepsi also isn't especially sexy from a social media perspective, if you check their twitter it's a lot of ""Hey, anyone drinking a Pepsi right now?"" which to me at least isn't particularly compelling.<p>Social media can be extremely effective, local businesses especially can get a lot from not a ton of investment. Bars and restaurants can post specials, parties, pictures from past events, do ticket giveaways, etc. In SF at least a lot of nightlife promotion and engagement happens on Facebook, and you only really need a person or two per venue or production house to make that happen effectively.",1365785855

However, even these cannot recover already-lost precision, so these need to be used with care as well.  For example, if you solve a quadratic and average the two roots to get the quadratic's maximum or minimum (stupid approach, yes this is contrived), you already have some lost precision in solving the quadratic and rounding results that isn't possible to recover.  Also, if there is cancellation involved, there is error you can't recover from -- this is called the condition number of the sum (it is (Sum abs(x_i)) / abs(Sum x_i)), and it represents a error bound (of a complex sort) that it's impossible to improve upon.<p>[1] www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/quake/public/papers/robust-arithmetic.ps",1365785522

Suppose for some reason you have the property that the hash for 10% of the words is ""be"" and the hash for a further 50% of the words is one of the words that hashes to ""be."" Using rainbow tables for this is not going to go well because all your chains are going to end up at ""be"" inside of a small number of iterations. But a hash with this property will also fail at its intended purpose because Alice could claim the hash for a word she doesn't know is 'be' and have a 10% chance of being right.<p>Good hash functions are specifically designed to make hash collisions like that as rare as possible, so in practice the compression ratio will be strongly correlated to the chain length, but you can still have instances where one hash value is slightly more common than another. The result is just that if you use a chain length of 100, the compression ratio in practice will be slightly worse than 100:1.<p>As to how to choose the heads of the chains, I suspect the answer for getting the absolute optimal choices will either be NP complete or will involve some application of linear algebra. If all else fails you could just keep adding random chains rooted in a value that isn't in any existing chain until you have full coverage. I don't know what people do in practice.",1365785161

So, yes, if you combine the bite statistics for six different breeds of dog (a few of which are very popular; all combined which make up about 7% of the dog population in the U.S.), the _six_ breeds will account for more biting incidents than any other _one_ dog. What a damning verdict.<p>This doesn't take into account any qualitative analysis either. For example, how many people buy a retriever or lab and train (aka, abuse) it to be aggressive towards everyone (i.e., a guard dog)?<p>Also, while voluntary, the American Temperament Test Society tests dogs in a number of scenarios for the overall temperament. Pit bull breeds do very well in these tests and have some of the highest sample sizes.<p>For example, page 1 (<a href=""http://atts.org/breed-statistics/statistics-page1/#totals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atts.org/breed-statistics/statistics-page1/#totals</a>) lists the American Pit bull terrier and American Staffordshire terrier as ranking very highly and having 800+ subjects.",1365784955

Even if you have exactly the same chemical condition as someone with Aspergers, unless your life can be improved by treatment, you don't have it.

Not coincidentally, prices were low and relatively stable (by modern standards). During the 1970s, the city of Petaluma in CA passed the Petaluma Plan, which drastically restricted development. Courts accepted this and more and more residential restrictions.<p>In the short term they didn't seem to matter much. But in the last 40 years, as the population has grown and as people have realized that cities are pretty awesome in many ways (including economically), supply and demand have gotten way out of whack. One example is Santa Monica, which has the same number of residents it did in 1970 but vastly higher prices: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/12/sustainable_santa_monica_coastal_california_is_green_but_without_population.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/12/sustainable_s...</a>.

Potential new residents can't vote, and courts have empowered existing residents and municipal boards.<p>Hypothetically, if we had some kind of national zoning / municipal board setting policy across the country, people in Texas or Arizona who wanted to move to SF would get equal weight with the people already in SF.

Why are the definitions written this way? Because mental disorders are often characterized by normal behaviors happening to an extreme degree (being anxious before a big potentially career-altering presentation is healthy, having panic attacks as a result of everyday situations is problematic).

I'm really hoping that's not the case, but even in a situation where she was not okay with his actions one night, she shouldn't have been sending him provocative photos the very next (I hope this isn't seen as victim-blaming on my part, since every situation is different and there's always the potential for Stockholm Syndrome-esque effects in these situations, I just don't think this is one of those).<p>The rest of her communications with him are clearly using him for who he is, and then quickly turn into spiteful posts when she realizes that she can't guilt him with sexy photos to invest in her and introduce her to others in the industry. Instead of informing him of being pregnant, she waits until the day she's ""scheduled"" to have an abortion to guilt him over it. Months later, when Arrington later asks if she wants to talk about it, she throws it in his face that she's ""Facebook official"" with someone ""if that's what you mean"", but is willing to meet up with him ""as soon as possible"" ""near his offices"" anyway (maybe in hopes someone would see them together).<p>On Scoble's status, she races to at the opportunity to insult another woman for being Arrington's new girlfriend (she isn't), drinking his ""Kool-aid"" and (if her claims turn out to be invalid) ironically accuses her of doing a disservice to victims of rape and abuse.<p>TL;DR, even if there's something remotely here for her to stand on, she needs some serious help. As such, I would absolutely call this evidence ""damning"" to the innocence/ignorance she's trying to portray.",1365783409

Someone unfamiliar with the framework needs to read these lines of code.  Boilerplate may be ""pre-typed"" for you, but it's part of ""your"" app, and it's optional.  That's not the same as a lib or the framework itself.  You could start your app differently.<p>The new hire has to deal with these LOC regardless of who typed them (you or a wizard), so they're significant.<p><i>2. Many frameworks on dynamic languages copy their entire corpus of functionality as source files into the application's root. Certainly we don't count those. Check out our Github repo's colored language bar at the top right.</i><p>Agree this should not be counted.  Only what's part of the app in question.  Put another way, if those directories could be ""hidden"" from the new hire, and he could do his job, don't count them.<p><i>3. Do build scripts count as LOC?</i><p>No.<p><i>4. Do configuration files count as LOC?</i><p>Yes.  The Spring framework's pom.xml or any dependency injection ""configuration"" file is crucial, so yes.  On configs, though, I'd guess kbenson's idea about diff is reasonable.<p>- - -<p>However, about diff on #1 above, I'm concerned that with diff you're really just measuring how different the test is from the boilerplate.  That says more about the test than about the framework.  Someone could also optimize their framework's pre-typed boilerplate to match your test. (As we see on browser rendering benchmarks, for example.)<p>Really, if it's code that's typed (by the framework or by you) into an application, it should be counted.<p>I'm coming to this from the standpoint of hiring a new developer onto a project.  More time is spent maintaining projects than jumpstarting them.  At some point really soon after jumpstarting the app, boilerplate and edited code are going to be intermingled and indistinguishable.  The new guy has to wrap his head around it all.  So I would like any code typed by you or for you to be counted.<p>And beyond LOC, it matters how those lines are distributed. If you have to open five nested files to find out what one hello world is doing, even if each file only has a single 3 line function in it, that's complexity that matters.  Number of files and number of directories both make a framework feel very different.<p>Most benchmarks are for weekend MVPers. Your benchmarks are moving into ""real world"" territory.  In the real world, being able to wrap your head around someone else's existing project matters.  LOC, files, directories, and dependencies, factor into that heavily.",1365782938

5539245,comment,5538869,5538869,24,0,jacquesm,,,"AppGratis simply served a need, both on the consumer side (App discovery) as well as on the corporate side (app promotion). What ratio paid apps to free apps they were running is guesswork but I'd imagine if they would fail at the mix they would fail in the marketplace. The bigger problem is that they were simply too good at what they were doing and were competing with Apple on Apple's turf. Apple would like to control how you discover Apps and any kind of curation that is successful will sooner or later be hit like this.<p>Whether or not AppGratis could have seen this coming is debatable, but the product was solid and seemed to have served a genuine need. If the app store would not be broken in many respects then AppGratis would have never been able to carve out the niche that it had.<p>App curation at the level that AppGratis was doing is really hard work, and you can't blame them for wanting to be compensated for that hard work. So a certain percentage of paid promotion is a fairly obvious step to make the model viable imo.<p>Their biggest mistake - if you can call it that - was probably to be too good at what they were doing.<p>In the AppStore no threat to Apple is too big to fail. Better remember that if you are successful with an app you wrote and you are possibly in competition with some portion of the Apple empire.",1365782549

For those unfamiliar with SF: Tenderloin is in the heart of SF (walking to Union Square shopping, Financial District) and where you go if you want to score drugs, offload stolen good, pick-up, or feel scared at night. Bayview and Hunters Point comprise miles of water-front property, close to the city center, on transit (T-line trolley car). Today they are a mix of industrial use, abandoned/empty/derelict industrial (there are brick warehouses that have been condemned since the 1989 quake), mixed in with some low income housing, and converted military barracks.<p>For a city infamous for its high rent, small rental stock, and boom in highly paid jobs to leave miles of water-front property undeveloped is near criminal. AFAIK, there are some complexities around industrial clean-up, but either way someone needs to get it done.",1365782516

It is a widely reported phenomena that is usually attributed to a more health-conscious society and a widening array of beverage choices.<p>Second, Pepsi's intention in offering contributions to non-profits based on social media recommendations was probably seen as a way to boost corporate image in a domain far beyond potential soda drinkers. It probably was meant to influence investors, journalists, regulators, and people like Mayor Bloomberg in New York who would portray soft drink vendors as an evil in our society. When you are a big as Pepsi, directly influencing buyers is only part of your advertising outreach.<p>Still, I agree with the article's overall conclusion. Social media advertising is typically not a very efficient way to convert advertising dollars to revenue. But it can be. With any advertising method, you have to devise a way to measure the results of a campaign, whatever your goals are. Otherwise, you are just throwing money in the air, hoping it lands somewhere useful.",1365782503

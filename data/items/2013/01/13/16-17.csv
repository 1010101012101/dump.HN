It was an organised attack, meant to ruin a person's life and deter anyone who wants to fight for information freedom, coordinated by well off, educated people who made conscious choices, had access to all the facts, were reminded repeatedly by the media how ridiculous and immoral their actions were and did it all for the political and financial benefit of special interests and the serfdom of everyone else.<p>These people were informed, they had to know how malevolent they were acting towards Aaron and those who try to maintain freedom and democracy in the digital world. They were aware and still chose to try to ruin his life even though he was clearly acting entirely in the interest of others and doing it in a manner that was civil and non violent. They did it just because he was smarter than most and thus a greater threat to entrenched powers. The level of evil here is truly off the scale. The fact that it resulted in his death is just...

So, for most talented web developers, the additional problems being solved aren't there.<p>It does solve: hey, I'd like to be lazy and develop with my stock chrome book. It does solve, hey, I'd like to develop without installing software (I think schools will be big customers, especially to get all the setups at once!?) but your typical good developer, is going to be very attached to vim, emacs, sublime text, or whatever he normally uses that isn't part of cloud9.<p>For developers of more complicated software, embedded, OS, etc. Or even for mobile devs, cloud9 is a non-starter since it doesn't integrate with their physical environments (Like, their ARM board, or iOS device, nuclear reactor, or whatever) so for a wide range of things it's just not an applicable solution.<p>I think cloud9 will see success in education markets, as well as business from developers who do lightweight web dev work who don't have a favorite editor already.",1358095907

You stop trying, and your lower mind stops presenting you with ideas for how to proceed or potential opportunities to pursue and learn from.  Reframing is a powerful technique, both when dealing with bad thoughts and with other people.  Change your internal language to something along the lines of ""I have an incorrect assumption about X that is preventing me from achieving it.  It is worth it if an experiment for achieving X doesn't work out, because it has a good chance of yielding information that will help me get there eventually.  I want X because in learning how to achieve it, it will make me feel A, B, and C.""<p>You are far from being able to say that you have failed at anything.  You are making ridiculous assumptions that bring you endless suffering for as long as you hold them.  So stop assuming so many things that both prevent you from improving and make you feel helpless.   You are feeling pain but you aren't listening to the assumptions about reality that it is trying to educate you about.  The pain will continue and most likely become worse until you put in the effort to understand it.",1358095870

Should we not protest one injustice because another has been committed?<p>> Look at the lot of it in this blokes name, not just one tiny insignificant part of it.<p>Do you believe that everyone here cares only about Aaron Swartz, and not the rest of these issues?<p>The death of Aaron Swartz is a particularly painful wake-up call, but it doesn't mean that people care only about him. It helps that he was a particularly sympathetic character, and that many people in this community knew him personally or were directly involved in his work and writing. Kim Dotcom is a international millionaire, who was violating copyright for substantial personal profit, and who had a mansion with a built-in bunker for just this sort of problem; and has been able to use his wealth and power to much more successfully defend himself. Bradley Manning is more sympathetic, but he did violate his duty to his country by revealing many secret documents that he had access to, without being particularly selective about anything that really showed abuses.<p>Aaron, on the other hand, was merely trying to preserve access to a large body of academic and scientific work. Nothing he did ever indicated that he intended to profit from his downloading. Heck, he never even distributed any of it. And while he used some techniques that were further into the grey-zone than many of us would try, the prosecution was so clearly out of proportion with the ""crime"" as to make the absurdity apparent to almost anyone (and the fact that it's treated as a crime rather than a civil matter is patently absurd as well).<p>It has always been the case that martyrs, or particular example of people persecuted by a system, are far more effective than general complaints about entire populations. There were millions of black people who had been treated unfairly, made to use separate bathrooms, drinking fountains, sit in the back of the bus, before Rosa Parks decided one day that she wouldn't take it any more and refused to move, leading to her arrest, and subsequently leading to bus boycotts and the case that eventually worked its way to the Supreme Court ruling that segregation on the bus system was illegal.<p>Putting a face on injustice is so much more effective than simply talking about it in the abstract. And when that face is a brilliant and well loved young man, who had many influential connections in the tech industry, who was working in the interests of knowledge and social justice, rather than some kid downloading the latest Hollywood blockbuster or an international millionaire trying to make a buck, it will be much more effective.<p>The stakes have been raised.

Would a video get more views on your blog or on a video sharing site with lots of content where people went to find content like that?\n2) I think the idea is that instead of using the current journal system, where professors try to show how their work has an impact for their university by paying to put it behind a paywall is just broken.  Ideally professors will post straight to Academia and bypass publishers altogether.  if you want people to read your work, putting it in an open, free forum where more people will see it AND you can track the metrics of your work seems far preferable to paying to put your work behind a paywall if you go the traditional route.  I think they seem to acknowledge that publishers won't be pleased if you post your already published work on Academia.\n3) The answer to the final thing seems to just be that it is a really tough technical challenge.  They seem to be a fairly small team and the facebook motto that ""the journey is 1% finished"" seems to apply here.  Imagine the possibilities if this takes off.  We currently think of journals as paper with ink on the pages, but a site where all academics can share their work, and we see new ways of sharing research, like executable code, rich media, etc, could really improve academia and science in general IMO.",1358095506

And then Ubuntu too - 10.04 LTS, 12.04, and 12.10. As for smartphones - 4 HTC phones with Android 2.3+, an iPhone and a Nokia Lumia. But, even if today Google releases Android for the desktop, I wouldn't use it (as my main OS). Atleast not now.<p>There are somethings that are hard-coded within users like me. No matter what we do, we will go back to windows, no matter how bad it is - be it Vista or Longhorn or whatever. Because that's the influence of Windows. Bill gates made sure Windows and PC's are in harmony with each other right from the beginning. The number of applications, the vibrant developer community and the number of epic GAMES!<p>You may not notice this pattern within the US where you will encounter a lot of people on OSX. But the rest of the world, which is the majority, loves Windows. It's not going to be like one fine day someone comes in and says hey, you know what, Android's there for desktop, so you can stop using Windows. That will never happen. One main reason is the enormous developer community and applications available for Windows. Not to forget the fact that Windows is the #1 most pirated OS of all time ESPECIALLY in countries like China, India, etc. which is where the majority of the population lives (#1, #2 respectively). This means, if you take into account all the pirated copies too, the user base is enormous and it only keeps growing with each day. Because that was Bill Gates' vision and he has actually accomplished it. By no means I'm an MSFT 'fanboy'. This is just from what I know, what I observe around me, based on some analytical data derived from my business. In other words, this article is a fluff.",1358095099

""Save kittens"" aka ""Save all kittens"" - this can divide your attention and distract you thinking about all of those kittens, and then feeling overwhelmed. This of course takes away from focusing on the base issue - much more nuanced and subtle to deal with. It's not easy educating people about nuances either. You need their attention, and you need to cut through all of the noise they've heard.",1358093681

So from each document, you can walk backwards to those that it cites.<p>In the past they also had a ""cited-by"" link-set on each document, which provided the ability to walk forward to documents which cite the one shown.  But looking at their cite now (it has been a while since I looked at them) the forward citation links appear to be missing, which looses half the citation graph.",1358093614

However, the route as shown on the map goes straight through absolute no man's land. There is no road along the eastern coast. A sensible route would be Yakutsk - Magadan, then take a boat or plane to the US.<p>I would love to read the story of someone who walked from Siberia to Alaska via the shortest sea crossing possible. But above Magadan, there are no more roads. And the Kolyma highway to Magadan is considered a major adventure already, with only a small window where the rivers are low enough to be crossed by motorcycle (and therefore, man).<p>I'm not saying this can't be done, but it looks like a serious arctic expedition to me.

Furthermore they are known to have sabotaged software to insert exploitable flaws and the CIA today will compromise compilers of specific individuals so that they compile backdoored binaries. Unlikely then, but replacing a popular hosted binary wouldn&#x27;t have been beyond their capability.<p>It&#x27;s not that unlikely they could crack some instances of PGP some of the time. Today the NSA docs reference being able to crack things like OTR sometimes, though unlikely.",1427360395

The consumer can happily process other transactions in the meantime.<p>It&#x27;s important to note is that no matter how you want to slice it, if instruction 1 never arrives, somehow you need a protocol to re-request it from upstream until you get it.<p>Whether that protocol lives in your middleware (e.g. an &quot;at least once&quot; message queue implementation that buffers messages and delivers them to your application in order) or in your consumer application logic (e.g. the application buffers messages and can send a request for a missing message over another channel), something is going to have to keep track of these things and buffer messages in the meantime.<p>This is why message queue middleware <i>appears</i> so convenient -- your application never has to see any of this complexity. I say <i>appears</i> because message queues can&#x27;t do at least 3 things:<p>(a) It can&#x27;t understand your application message processing order (which is NOT the same as your physical sending order): notice that how the message queue middleware and application determine if a message is missing are at fundamentally different levels of abstraction. The middleware can, at best, use e.g. sequence numbers or checkpoints to figure out a message is missing. An application has higher-order business knowledge about what the messages <i>mean</i> and so can determine if a message is missing much more intelligently. An application can also happily process other valid sequences of instructions without waiting for <i>all</i> preceding but possibly unrelated messages (e.g. it can accept an order for client A while still waiting for client B&#x27;s full order to come through).<p>(b) Message queues DO drop messages so again without a higher-level protocol across the transaction sequence to manage this you will have a problem if you require all messages to be processed.<p>(c) You can&#x27;t easily replay an event e.g. because your consumer stuffed up processing. It&#x27;s true that many message queuing implementations can keep a duplicate journal and allow you to replay from there, but this is probably an opaque data store. You can probably inspect the message, but ultimately you will end up writing application-specific logic to figure out which message to replay, whether the copy of the message is retrieved from the message queue system or from upstream.<p>At that point, the end-to-end principle [1] applies and you start to wonder if all that intelligence in messages queues is a waste. I&#x27;m personally looking at moving over to using DDS for data distribution and RPC over DDS to do replay and reconciliation between publisher and consumer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle</a>",1427357144
9268291,comment,9265817,9267840,0,0,wutbrodo,,,">  For a mom who is trying to juggle 2 children, yes, I can see this as a huge help. But for the vast majority of the target demographic (young, single-ish, urban upper middle class folks), we&#x27;re not gaining hours in a day.<p>Wat. The mom in this example may find apps like this more _necessary/useful_, but how does it save her more time than it saves the single person?  I got back from the symphony a couple of hours ago and need to get some laundry detergent and other sundries:  instead of wasting a good chunk of the part of my day that overlaps with regular hours (when concerts, restaurants, parties, parks, meetups, shows, etc are all open), I spent 4 minutes at 11 pm ordering that stuff before going to bed.  Perhaps if your free time consists of sitting on your couch staring at a blank wall, then maximizing free time is not particularly useful, but for those of us who actually do things in our free time, making chores more efficient is a no-brainer. (Though in my case this particular example is a little less salient because I live within half a mile of multiple walgreens so I can usually pick sundries up on my way home.  The general principle still applies).",1427357117

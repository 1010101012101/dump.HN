438556,story,,,6,8,DarkShikari,"Ask HN: promoting an open source product?",,"I am one of two main developers on a popular open source program (x264) used widely on both Windows and Linux (available under GPLv2).  It has the following attributes:<p>1.  Only one of its kind: there is no other free (open source or otherwise) program that can replace what it does.  Consumer-level commercial competitors include Quicktime, Nero, and the new DivX 7.  Professional-level commercial competitors include Mainconcept and Elecard.<p>2.  Considerably better than the vast majority of commercial implementations--and arguably, for some purposes, the best in the world.<p>3.  Already an important part of the backend on many major websites, such as Youtube and Facebook.<p>4.  Critical to the entire business plan of many medium-size startups, such as Vudu and Avail Media.<p>5.  Has helped me get a great deal of contracting and consulting work.<p>6.  We own the best possible domain name for the program (www.x264.com).<p>However, the reason I'm asking about things here is the following problem: while we're extremely popular in the hobbyist world, in the commercial world, we're really only used among those ""in the know,"" like Google; for every Youtube there are a hundred sites that have no idea what they're doing and don't know the benefits of using the product.  Part of this is because there is no central website to provide basic information and support for the program--such are things when there are only two main developers on a project.<p>Worse, more and more commercial programs are ripping us off, usually in violation of the GPL.  This is unavoidable, as most of these programs are sold out of China or similar, and if a crackdown ever occurs, they just change the product name again.  But both for the future benefit of the project and the benefit of my wallet, I figure it is a good idea to try to spread name recognition.  This is made an even bigger problem by the fact that it is apparently official Google policy to refuse to publicly acknowledge the internal use of open source products (yes, I am not kidding you, this is from directly from one of the main backend guys at Youtube)--meaning that we have to go out and say that Youtube is using us because they won't do it.  Of course, it helps that our watermarks show up on their new HD videos.<p>Where is a good place to go to get a basic but professional-looking website for the project where we can post useful information, news updates, and so forth?  I can write all the material, but I'm clueless when it comes to web design.  The most HTML I've written is handwritten text, image layouts, and sometimes tables.  Furthermore, what advice does HN have in general for an open source project looking to ""go professional""?  We already have corporate backing in the form of development resources and/or money from Joost and Avail Media, but from the outside, none of it shows through; we're just two bored hackers to everyone else.",1232225642

Given sufficient time and effort, Lisp will eventually be <i>just as fast</i> as C, and will run on the exact same hardware. Heck, we're already pretty damn close to that, but it took us <i>50 years</i>. C/Unix won because it got there much earlier, and it did so by compromising the design in order to get a clean/easy implementation.<p>As for C being easier to master, that's a highly dubious claim, and it's not even relevant. The crux of Worse is Better is that if you can't do the right thing, you simply shift the burden to the user. Bignums are hard to get right? No sweat: programmers will just have to learn to live with integers that magically wrap around when they reach 32768.<p>Making a language that's easy to learn <i>is</i> the Right Thing.

So instead of somehow finding $100M in venture capital and duplicating their infrastructure, why not join them as an employee?

People said, ""He's giving up this great opportunity for an education.""  Huh?  When Nike pays you $90M for endorsing shoes, you can afford to pay the authors of your favorite text books to come to your house and tutor you.  Playing basketball in exchange for $50K/year (max) in tuition reimbursement when you could be playing for millions is idiotic.  What if you get hurt?  And, you're giving up what are literally four of your best earning years.<p>Even if not via a Rhodes scholarship, wouldn't Oxford still accept this guy a decade from now?  What about attending in the off-season?  I once met a guy who played football for the Cowboys in the early '80s.  He attended a top-tier medical school part-time while playing and went to law school at Stanford when he finally ""retired.""  Was he rational?<p>I'm all for education (or, more precisely, becoming educated), but if someone had offered me $10M/year to stare at a wall for 2000 hours a year in lieu of college for four years, I think I'd have taken the offer.  Think of all the learning I could be doing now if I didn't have to have that day job!",1232222917

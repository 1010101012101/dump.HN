He presents several solutions, not all of which I would buy.<p>The is_deleted column is a pretty simple solution that we all use and there are a number of solutions to the problem of retrieving only the active columns, such as views.<p>Audit trails and performance are more interesting.  A while back I worked for a web analytics company and we had the problem of the storage and performance costs of historical data.  Only the 5% of the data was of any real interest, but the 95% historical data made writes slow because of the large number of indexes.  They adopted the solution of historical tables with fewer indexes on cheaper drives.<p>I like the solution of serializing historical, deleted, and audit data and storing them in a NonSQL database of your choice.  Then you can bring them back as individual undos, or into a data mining database for scenario playing.<p>I dont particularly like his suggestion of creating separate tables for each state of an element.  I think that's needless complexity.",1258829967

954769,comment,954600,954689,0,0,zck,,,"Hrm, in the HN source v3.1, there's a function <i>canonical-url</i> that strips off anything after a <i>?</i> in the url, but only when the site is in <i>stemmable-sites</i>* . If used to find dupes, this would work. However, there are only two places in the entire source (reported by grep) that refer to the variable <i>stemmable-sites</i>* . The first is in the definition of <i>canonical-url</i>. The second is assigning a table to <i>stemmable-sites</i>* . As far as I can tell, no urls are ever added to the table by the code, only by hand.<p>It seems like <i>stemmable-sites</i>* is used to tell what sites don't use the query sting (the part of the url after the question mark) to differentiate pages (see: on Wikipedia the url <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis</a> differs from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Costello"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Costello</a> only in the query string, but the two pages are different), so they can be safely removed, and still get the same page.<p>The problem here is that google's adding query strings to other site's domains. Now, these query strings don't change the page. However, HN assumes by default that they do, so it doesn't remove them in the canonical url. Since google is adding them to every link, you can't add a set of urls to <i>stemmable-sites</i>* and let <i>canonical-url</i> strip off the query string. It seems like you could remove any arguments with field names <i>utm_source</i>, <i>utm_medium</i>, or <i>utm_campaign</i>, but that would assume that no site uses the field/variable pairs to differentiate pages.",1258829506

954749,comment,953913,953931,0,0,stcredzero,,,"A part of the disconnect between the way computing power is packaged and the way people <i>would like</i> to use it, is the way computing power for ""information/organizational"" functionality is divided from ""entertainment"" functionality.<p>For most of what people want to do, a netbook has enough or almost enough horsepower.  Heck, even an iPhone has enough power for most of it.  The only thing you need a full-blown desktop for is for heavy duty Photoshop, graphics software, gaming, or something demanding like that.<p>So, note how the form factors are disconnected from capabilities:<p><pre><code>    - iPhone - capable of word processing, but lacks a keyboard to do a lot of 
        it comfortably
    - All-in-one desktop machine - often capable of demanding gaming, but 
        marketed as the email/web machine for your grandmother.  
</code></pre>
I see computing coming in two major forms in the future: highly portable, or home/office integrated.<p>Much of our personal data will be on devices sized like the iPhone or Blackberry.  They will be small enough to go everywhere with us.  What doesn't fit there will live in game-console like machines in our homes, or on office workstations/high-end laptops, and will move around using the network.  As networks get better, much of that will live in the ""cloud.""<p>Given better form factors (dockable screens and keyboards and other, newer input devices) the ""go-everywhere"" device will subsume more and more of our computing tasks.  There will no longer be netbooks.  There will be ""things that allow us to word process/schedule/surf more comfortably"" by providing better form factors for interface, but the data will live in our pocket and be synced with the cloud.  There will be ""other things with the compute/graphics/storage horsepower for specialized tasks.""  These will be the ""hubs, consoles, workstations.""  These will be the only stationary things, because they will be the only things that have to be stationary.<p>Everything else will be interface.  (The OQO will live at last!)",1258827953

HF Data Analysis uses Excel and R.<p>2.) Using R for Introductory Statistics (Verzani) -- Good explanations and exercises, and you will also learn R. This second point is actually pretty important, because it's a very valuable tool. Whereas the Head First Stats book walks though pretty simple problems that you work out in pencil, the Verzani book has many real-world data sets to explore that would be impractical to do by hand.

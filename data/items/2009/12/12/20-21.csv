Experience lets you add more value to a point (probably around 10 years), but lots of young programmers are equally if not more productive.  Many are willfully ignorant of ""business"" concerns and make terrible managers.<p>It's not a scalable career for most people.<p>Making $200k+/yr is not especially hard in high cost of living markets, but it's also not a lot of money there.

Where did I say that I failed macroeconomics?<p>I don't need you to regurgitate the textbooks. I was making a specific point which you did not understand. That is fine. Maybe I gave a bad explanation.<p>But if you don't understand what I'm saying, you can ask questions or <i>at least</i> address something I <i>actually</i> said. Don't just google ""Federal Reserve"" and copy-paste their website.<p>>However, by Keynesian theory (which is not absolutely proven be right, but has worked pretty well over the past 75 years), inflation (at reasonable levels) is more conductive to investment and consumption and overall economic vitality than deflation, due to people being more inclined to spend and invest money that would lose value just sitting there.<p>This has been disproven. Note how all computer technology experiences deflation - it is a benefit not a detriment. Deflation was a major issue in the days before electronic currency because it meant the mint would have to re-issue new money constantly to retain liquidity. But this is no longer the case.<p>The danger with deflation is that the money supply will become illiquid. Central banks in the past have accidentally induced illiquidity and deflation at the same time by restricting the money supply without issuing smaller currency denominations. This leads to illiquidity which is the worst possible thing.<p>With modern technology it is trivial to keep the money supply liquid in a deflationary environment and so the policy of continual inflation is no longer needed.<p>On top of that, the inflation rates are too high anyway. In an environment of continual inflation, it absolutely matters what order you eat in. Each new supply of money devalues all the money that came before it. It works its way through the economy in a specific order trickling down from the banks. Whoever receives this money first receives it BEFORE the entire money supply has been devalued which gives them an instant wealth increase relative to those they pay the money to.<p>When a bank loans 100k to an entrepreneur, the entrepreneur will make concessions to get that money. The money is worth more to the entrepreneur than to the bank, because until the money reaches the money supply as a whole it has not yet devalued the currency. As soon as it changes hands, the currency slightly inflates. When the entrepreneur pays his staff, it devalues again, and so on until it reaches some theoretical ""room temperature"" asymptotic point and the inflationary effect is complete.<p>The inflation does not occur when the money is released to the banks from the Fed. It occurs when the money trickles down into the hands of the average person. The people who get to spend this money before it reaches the average person's hands are spending non-inflated money. But the instant it reaches the hands of those people it is inflated money. This is why there is an effect where money is worth more the closer it is to the mint, and people who have jobs that allow them to receive payments closer to the mint* will naturally be more wealthy.<p>This effect happens in every inflationary economy, and the higher the rate of inflation, the bigger the effect.<p>*It should be obvious that when I said mint I actually mean the Federal Reserve issuing electronic currency.",1260650832

Truth is, they were both important and (assuming the author is suggesting Jobs was the 'business' guy and Woz was the 'programmer') Apple would not be what it is today if one or the other didn’t play a role.<p>One of the most important lessons I learned at my startup as a programmer is the value that commercial business people bring. Yes, we programmers are important at the beginning when the product is being developed, but once the business of the product gets going, the business people become very important.<p>Check out some of Steve Blank's posts on customer development vs. product development. In a recent slide presentation I flipped through, he states that most startups fail because of a lack of customer development (typically what 'business' people do), and not because of a lack of product development (which is typically what developers do).  (And yes I realize that the programmer can possibly do both, but not as fast as two people who work well together can).<p>At the end of the day, both skill sets are required to make the startup successful, and for one to say he or she is more important than the other is like the fable I once heard about the eyes saying they were more important than the ears who thought they were more important than the hands who thought they were more important than the feet, etc. etc.<p>I know I will likely get seriously down voted for this type of comment on a programmer centric board, but the programmer 'divas' who think that the world would stop if it were not for their brilliance annoy the hell out of me.

He was pulled over by the US border police so this could not have been a customs matter. Unless they had tip that he was doing something illegal or he broke a law like speeding, I don't know why they would have pulled him over.<p>Also I have crossed the border plenty of times, what I have issues with is that customs officials are given too much discretion it seems in what they can do. If an officer has a bad day they can pretty much do what they wanted.<p>The worst I saw was when my brother was renewing his TN1 visa. I was driving him to the airport in Buffalo. We waited for close to two hours at the customs office. The whole time the customs officers were just talking about their weekend, what their plans were, on one was actually doing their job.<p>Two girls that were there before us finally asked, and they were were courteous while do so, when their case would be handled. They said they had waited for 3 hours and were on their way to a funeral. The customs officer blew up at them right away, told them to shut up, used allot of swear words directed at them and threatened to throw them in jail.<p>Nothing the girls did warranted that behavior. After his tirade he had everyone that was waiting come over and denied them entry right on the spot without hearing them out. The whole time all the other officers were just laughing.<p>Usually everyone has always been professional when I crossed the border and that was the only time I have seen someone on a power trip. But it does happen, and when it happens you are pretty much screwed if you are caught in the cross fire.",1260648520

The skills of the initial team are perhaps the most immutable of resource constraints you have. If you don't have a business/sales guy, don't get into selling software just because ""37signals told you to.""

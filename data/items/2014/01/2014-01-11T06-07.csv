7041884,comment,7040351,7041053,7,0,kevind23,,,"I do not want localised search results. If I wanted to search for Chinese food in Chicago, then I would ask for it specifically. I initially switched to DDG because of the insistence on giving me &quot;personalised&quot; results. BS. I came here to search the entire internet, not just for things that are specific to Google&#x27;s picture of me. It almost always made for awful results, especially when it ranked local sites higher than anything actually relevant or useful. Same goes for recent news. If I want recent news, I&#x27;ll go to the website of a newspaper in my area. Why would I search for that?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because I grew up with web search as just that -- a way of finding websites. I don&#x27;t search for information; I search for websites which provide me the information I need. I can see how Google&#x27;s algorithms work for some people, but for me, DDG is exactly what I want. If I typed everything I ever wanted to know directly into Google, then I&#x27;m getting the information Google wants me to see, including if someone pays for the placement. I don&#x27;t like that kind of control, and I don&#x27;t like the idea of a single entity controlling the flow of knowledge over the internet. So I don&#x27;t use Google.",1389423475

Whoever improved the most articles in a particular period of time would get a few new games sent to their Steam account. That&#x27;s paid editing, albeit for PC games rather than money.

In the case of a retail store, I would think that would be as soon as the accept or decline response from the payment processor is received.<p>To make a charge, the POS terminal packages the mag stripe data (and the encrypted PIN-block if doing debit) together with the POS terminal&#x27;s ID, the amount to be charged, and maybe the CVV2 or the billing zip code, etc., into an HTTPS request to the payment processor. A second or two later, the payment processor responds, and the terminal completes the transaction.<p>If that&#x27;s how Target&#x27;s POS terminals work, then the hackers probably managed to push a &quot;software update&quot; out to the terminals causing them to tee the data off to the hackers&#x27; server whenever a transaction was made.<p>The reason the debit PINs were safe is that the PIN pads on which the customers enter their PINs are separate self-contained devices which encrypt the PINs before they leave the pad. Only the payment processor has the key needed to decrypt the PIN blocks, and PIN pads don&#x27;t accept &quot;software updates&quot;.

My count is that they had 157 employee-months prior to shutdown at a fully-loaded cost of approximately $9,200 per employee-month.  An employee-month is one month worked by a founder or employee, but not a consultant.  Fully-loaded costs includes recruiting, healthcare, salary, and taxes, but (for the purpose of this calculation) does not include pro-rated costs for rent, hardware, software licenses, or what have you.  Those are all numbers I&#x27;d be careful to bake into my planning as a founder but which I don&#x27;t need to reverse the math here to salary packages.<p>I would <i>ballpark</i> the average package at Everpix as what Americans would understand as &quot;$90k plus healthcare plus equity.&quot;  This is <i>not</i> straight-line comparable to &quot;$90k plus healthcare&quot; at other US-based software firms, even those with baseline perks packages for working professionals rather than those competing in the Valley perks arms-race with Google and Facebook.  For example, if one were to take &quot;$90k plus healthcare&quot; at an insurance company doing Java EE XL mappings every day, it is virtually beyond question that there&#x27;d be 401Ks with employer matching and whatnot in the picture as well.<p>If you were to do a straight-line comparison with e.g. Google or Facebook, this is substantially below their pure-cash offers for <i>fresh graduates with no professional experience</i>, and both would add both substantial cash bonuses and incentives plus equity grants plus perks with non-trivial cash value.  The compensation packages employees capable of solo-shipping e.g. iOS applications or non-trivial image recognition software would be offered are <i>substantially</i> north of that.  $140k cash-on-the-barrel plus industry standard perks isn&#x27;t even an eyeraising number for <i>intermediate</i> engineers with no skill more specialized than shipping working software.<p>I&#x27;m mostly doing this math to say that &quot;Lavish expenditures on employees were not a contributing factor here.  They paid substantially below-market wages for employees doing similar jobs locally.&quot;  I know that this might cause people who are not located in the Valley to feel a bit of heartburn given the absolute numbers, but that&#x27;s another discussion entirely.

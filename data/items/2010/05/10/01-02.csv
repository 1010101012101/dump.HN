The refining processes in question make the refined food much easier to digest, which causes the insulin spikes and (theoretically) the rest of the problems that arise when that happens chronically.<p>Personally I don't think it's impossible to mass-produce quality food, and there are other forms of ""refinement"" that can either raise the quality of the food, or bring out specific characteristics of the food without much loss, such as cold-pressing oils, so I don't think of refinement itself as a sort of dirty word or anything.

P/S was required on the 'accelerated' track- the accelerated track prepped you to take the BC Calc AP exam which will test you out of Calc and Calc 2.  The Multivariable and Linear classes were both elective credits and only half a year each, and also there were no AP tests so you had to convince your college to let you test out of them on your own (though I can't imagine anyone had any problems with that).  Both those courses had maybe a dozen kids in them (in a class of 400ish), and it was taught by the same teacher we had for Calc and Pre-Calc our Junior year.<p>Truly the best teacher I ever had without any doubt, had a passion for the math, the students, the teaching, and did an amazing job motivating a few of us that were used to doing the bare minimum and gaming the system (which as has been noted is what ends up happening to a lot of 'gifted' students).

And I'm not convinced that every glucose molecule undergoes glycolysis.  According to the MD in the video (minute 45 or so), 80% of glucose gets turned to CO2 and water by the organs in the body before the rest of the glucose even makes it to the liver, where eventually,  ~.4% of it turns into VLDL (which is bad for you).  You only need a bit of pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) to get the Krebs cycle going, and then that takes care of the glucose, turning it into CO2 and water, without turning it into fructose in the process.  And at no point is there any native fructose involved.  And besides, in the video, it says fructose can't be metabolized by the brain.<p>I'd also like to point out I'm not drinking a shitload of this stuff all at once.  The reason I avoid this is to avoid an insulin spike, which would, without question, defeat the purpose of using dextrose.",1273454596

It also states that fructose is more likely to form advanced glycation endproducts, but this is far less important than the hormonal differences.<p>So from all practical viewpoints, I agree with you. Fructose is way worse!

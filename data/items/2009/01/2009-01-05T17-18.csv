420789,comment,420183,420743,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"You shouldn't act like terms exist in a vaccuum. Remember that the Republicans and Democrats were on completely different sides of the political spectrum less than a century ago.<p><i>Classical liberalism is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights, natural rights, the protection of civil liberties, individual freedom from restraint, constitutional limitation of government, free markets, and a gold standard to place fiscal constraints on government</i><p>In a modern political climate these would sound somewhat conservative (mainly 'free markets' and 'limited government'). I think the best modern-day fit would be Libertarianism, which is considered by many to be far-right.<p>This is why we as a society should really adopt the two-axis means (political compass) of understanding ""ism""s. I really hope the public is smart enough to factor just one more dimension into their political analysis, but mass stupidity is always full of surprises.",1231178278

EBS is a high-performance disk system offering speeds of 70MB/s in the real world.  Databases love fast disks.  Slicehost's disks are slow (at least for high performance databases).  Xen doesn't have great disk access speed and they're just plain old local disks.  So, if you need to scale up a database, AWS is going to accommodate that better.<p></i>Infinidisk!  With Slicehost, you have a fixed disk size and you can't buy more.  With EBS, you can just keep getting more and more disk - you can even stripe volumes so that they show up as a single disk to your instance.<p>Life is about trade-offs.  I love Slicehost and use them for all my stuff.  I've set up EC2 stuff for other people who wanted it.  So, it really depends on what you need.",1231178052

They look for the cheapest first, see if it meets their needs then move ""up"" (left in this case) until they find the one that is the most affordable that meets their needs. They were probably getting a lot of Basic sign ups, so the emphasis would be getting those people to double their payment level by highlighting the next level up as the best deal.<p>I don't think highlighting the most expensive package to make the others feel cheaper by comparison is very user-friendly either. Users want to quickly find the best package for them and not feel like they're compromising by picking something other than the highest level. Highlighting the highest package sends a signal of inferiority for the rest of the items. By highlighting the middle one, they're saying ""hey this is a great package"" on its own.

In short, there's a little bit of play in each of the gears, and one can ""take up the play"" in each stage before force is transmitted through the stage.  There's two kinds of play: actual air gap, and also elasticity of the steel gear teeth.<p>Dealing with backlash is a key component in designing machine tools like metal lathes and milling machines.<p>High end CNC tools use ball screws and other techniques to reduce the amount of backlash experienced.",1231177447

A large component of these courses took place in online discussion forums, where RAW encouraged the participants to use e-prime for all discussion.<p>At least one of the courses also included readings from Alfred Korzybski and the General Semanticists, who played a large role in formulating the concept and practice of e-prime.<p>Korzybski wrote a fascinating book called Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics.  In this work, Korzybski postulates that the multi-millennium-old Aristotelian system of thinking contributes a form of ""essentialism"" to the underlying metaphysical assumptions of the Western linguistic and philosophic traditions (""things"" having ""is-ness"").<p>Korzybski argues that these metaphysical assumptions appear ""false-to-facts"" with modern scientific understanding (i.e. an operational accounting inspired by biological and physical systems thinking).  These assumptions introduce flawed and delusional reasoning when projected on to a linguistic domain, and their operation on a human social system over time results in the emergence of pathological behaviors in individuals' interactions.<p>Korzybski and others concluded that a step towards a more-sane system of thinking might result in part from making explicit the flawed metaphysical assumptions implicitly derived from Arestotelianism, and eleminating their behavioral manifestation in speech (i.e. as forms of the verb ""to be"").<p>Science and Sanity can be previewed online at Google Books:<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=KN5gvaDwrGcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=korzybski+non-aristotelian#PPP1,M1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=KN5gvaDwrGcC&printsec=f...</a><p>Incidentally, the same RAW course which took readings from Korzybski also included James Joyce's Ulyesses as a primary text.",1231176195

Also, it's not really a trust fund.  Excess funding does go into a trust fund but it is then lent to the Treasury and spent.  Instead of using the power of time to get a decent rate of return it's basically sitting.<p>Two, I agree, mostly.  Since SS depends upon multiple workers for every payee, as the birth rate grows taxes increase or benefits decrease.  As either happens it stops being perceived as a retirement plan (which the general public currently does) and starts being perceived as welfare.<p>On the third point, I don't disagree at all on how many people live off of it.  Our generation expects a much, much higher quality of living than our parents and grandparents.  $1,000 a month is barely enough to pay for the cost of very basic living.  Think no vacations, meager meals, no cable TV, no going out for movies, etc.<p>The terrible thing is, if that money had been invested instead of sitting like it has, those people could easily be living on man, many times that.<p>I think far less people would have issues with parking a mandatory 12% of their income into investments than letting the government handle it.",1231175263

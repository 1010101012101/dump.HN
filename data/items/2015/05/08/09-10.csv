Persistent datastructures and immutability make threading <i>much</i> easier to deal with, and so this has been asynchronous from the start using the fantastic core.async to coordinate everything. This means that in terms of raw responsiveness, it&#x27;s really really good.<p>Once it&#x27;s compiled down and optimised (especially given that we&#x27;re using Skummet to bypass Var indirection in the production build) there really is very little difference from Java in raw speed. Sure there are some pitfalls and you need to know to avoid proxy, reflection, too many lazy-seqs etc. but you need to know your language and work around bottlenecks whatever you&#x27;re using.<p>Add to this the obvious increase in development velocity, and the extra stability you get from the reduction in side effects/race conditions/nil punning from all this nice functional code, and I really think we&#x27;re on to a winner.<p>One nice example I think is how PersistentVectors allow us to send the entire touch history around the system with every touch event, without incurring a massive memory cost or having to build a whole new list every time. Compared with normal Android MotionEvent handling code where everything that uses it has to keep state, and make copies because the MotionEvent might get re-used from under you etc. this has been an absolute dream to use for no performance penalty.",1431078517

It efficiently bridges the gap and provides access to to areas that are less well connected by the large lines. Reaching those areas in East Berlin is a breeze, reaching them in West Berlin a pain.

9510641,comment,9500301,9501436,0,0,skuhn,,,"Actually, I realized that we were both wrong on the math.<p>2200 gflop or 3500 gflop are the specs for just one of the Fire Pro cards. Whoops, I was writing a lot of comments that day.<p>So a Mac Pro with D700 GPUs has 7000 gflop/s and runs $4600 (list), whereas the Tesla K80 has 8740 gflop/s and runs $4900 or so. Since you still need a whole server to go with the K80, I stand by my thinking that it&#x27;s not a great deal. We also don&#x27;t need 12GB of VRAM for our use case, so that&#x27;s a bit of a waste.<p>In Nvidia&#x27;s product line, price/gflop is not at its best in their highest end cards. AWS uses the Nvidia GRID K2, for instance. You&#x27;re paying a lot for the double precision performance in the Teslas, and imaging doesn&#x27;t need it.",1431075928

It is the latter point that was overlooked, and this optimization has come to bite us. Lack of validation here let our mystery corruption through the gate – giving ZooKeeper bad data which it reasonably believed was protected by TCP. We claim this is a bug – intentional or not.<p>This would only be a false sense of security. It only tells you that there was a bug in the formation of the packet <i>after</i> the checksum was calculated. If your failure case assumes a system can&#x27;t put together a packet, how can you assume that it even makes it to the checksum calculation step correctly?<p>Edit: There is also another downside to enabling TCP checksumming after decryption. It eliminates the possibility of hardware TCP checksum offloading so you would be paying the performance cost of software checksumming every packet. This is why the RFC was written that way to begin with...",1431075644

Because it basically is a form of decentralized (must be good, right :P) public transport which is lacking now in most countries and cities: something which can get you from A to B at any time of the day or night without requiring walking/cycling to intermediate points where you then have to wait for your bus/train/.. to arrive.",1431075619

5223778,comment,5223250,5223385,4,0,rz2k,,,"This is not my area of expertise at all, but that sounds backwards.<p>As I understand it a given number of molecules' bonds can be broken at any point to generate current. In colder ambient temperature the propensity to generate current decreases. However, the quantity does not. In other words, the apparatus for measuring what ""charge"" is available will incorrectly judge how much is left, but an intelligent system on the other hand may also take into account what the ambient temperature is doing to the sensor of how much current flows given a certain test circuit.<p>I'd guess that there is not an objective way to measure the charge left. I'd also guess that at a colder temperature it might not have as much power or as much torque, but that it would not affect the range, especially if the battery if artificially (or intrinsically) warmed once it gets toward the ""bottom"" of its capacity.<p>What the support people could have been talking about is how to game the system so that the sensors report a more reasonable gauge of the true range. That means that the supposed decrease overnight was not that the potential energy dissipated, but that the colder temperature lead to less accurate readings. Causing a current draw through driving slowly in the parking lot and running the heater might cause the battery to heat up, and thereby affect the current available to a test circuit, something that matters to the sensors' test circuits.<p>I'd like to hear from someone who actually knows something about electrical engineering, but without being informed on the field, it looks like a failure of imagination in assuming good faith and imaging possible scenarios.<p>gratuitous analogy:<p>Let's say it is a fictitious 1975 where Porsche has remote telemetry, and a NYT reviewer is skeptical about oil-cooled engines, because he states that you may run a little low on oil then also be low on coolant or vice versa. In the early morning of a freezing day, he looks at the dipstick. It says he is a three or four quarts low! He calls support, and they tell him that he will have more oil if he warms up the engine, and he'll be able to go for a drive without hurting the engine. (They should have said that he would get a more accurate measurement rather than get more oil) So, he starts the car, revs the engine, drives in circles, etc. Maybe he checks the oil again, maybe not. He takes off, and a couple hours later the engine seizes up. Apparently, it was both looking like it was extremely low on oil and was also actually very low on oil. The telemetry shows the reviewer appearing foolish, and possibly trying to ruin the engine. You could say that he is a professional and should have been able to parse the statements from support more intelligently. Yet they both look bad, but it may not be an inaccurate depiction of what end users would experience.",1360889823

5223690,comment,5222370,5223403,3,0,SimianLogic2,,,"I grew up in cherokee county, went to UGA for undergrad and GT for grad school. Lived in midtown for a year and East Point for a year (it was cheap!). I came out to CA for a summer in undergrad and fell in love with the parks. Came out again for an internship in grad school and fell in love with a girl. Moved out here in 2007.<p>Compared to Georgia/Atlanta, the biggest changes I've noticed are:
1) everything is much much more expensive. a house that would be ~$200k-$250k inside the perimeter  will cost ~$700k-$800k on the peninsula. houses in the $300-$400k range would probably go for $1-2mm out here.  Average restaurant bills are ~$50 for my wife & I for what I would consider pretty ""normal"" places (we'd probably average $25-30 in comparable Atlanta restaurants). I'm lucky that my wife's job has on-site daycare for <i>only</i> $1500/month. The one exception is veggies--I routinely go to the local farmer's market and walk away with a week's worth of veggies for under $20.
2) at the same time, salaries are a lot higher. even if your housing/expenses take up the same percentage of your paycheck, your disposable income will generally go a lot further (an iPad costs what it costs anywhere in the U.S.) I've bought things since moving West that I probably never would've spent money on living in GA, just because I had that extra disposable income (i.e. flying to the UGA-Arizona State game a few years back). This can be a double-edged sword, though--if you want to do your own thing or start your own company, it will be MUCH harder to do that here than in Atlanta (making $50k in the app store is a hell of a lot cooler in Atlanta than it is in silicon valley)
3) people are generally pretty nice, but not interested at all in getting to know you or chatting randomly. we've been in the same house for 4 years now and barely know the neighbors
4) the amount of stuff within driving distance is really, really incredible--including the excellent state and county parks. people here are MUCH more interested in going outdoors on the weekends (whereas I found in GA people mostly just hang out on the weekends, maybe having a bbq or going to a lake).
5) if you're an engineer and decent at what you do, you'll never want for a job.
6) the work is a lot more high-energy -- i know engineers in ATL who work from 9-5 (or less) and more or less coast through the day... but are smart enough to get all their work done. that sort of attitude does not fly at all in silicon valley. if you feel like you're smarter than everyone around you in Atlanta, move out here and you'll be pleasantly surprised 
7) if you're interested in things like hackathons, there's always something going on and it's pretty easy to meet like-minded people
8) the weather's awesome",1360888803

OHIM or whoever is assessing the application have to refuse the grant on this basis otherwise there would be a severe curtailment to the ability for practitioners in the field to describe basic and essential tools without confusion.<p>To grant such a term as a trademark, an indicator that goods and services carrying the mark ""python"" originate with Veber/Pobox, would be an absolute travesty akin to granting someone a mark for Jeans or Denim in the relevant categories for clothing.<p>It worries me slightly to see that this appeal has been made because it suggests a deficiency in legal counsel; unless the intention is to counter-sue.<p>Trademark primacy can be established by long term use but holding a domain name with a mark in [particularly one like Python that is established as a {non-registered?} trade mark already, eg of PSF] doesn't demonstrate use of a trade mark <i>for trade</i>. Moreover as I understand the TM law in the UK/EC it should [according to statute] be impossible for anyone to register a trade mark from under you, that is you would still be able to continue your prior usage of the term. In this respect a RTM is somewhat like a patent, you can't prevent someone from continuing in their prior [public] usage. As a quibble grant of a registered trademark doesn't necessarily give exclusive rights for this very reason.<p>On a side note, it seems they are also only applying for an image mark? That would make the claim that they're trying to prevent your use of the term Python wrong, they can only prevent you using their image or one confusingly like it as I understand it.<p>FWIW the earliest CTM relevant Vienna class 9 application I could find was from an individual in Germany from 2002 (002567972) and that the use was for something to do with automobile tuning (see eg <a href=""http://www.offroad-forum.de/viewtopic.php?t=11763&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=&sid=937b8c61dae77ba390013753044e7a6f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.offroad-forum.de/viewtopic.php?t=11763&start=...</a>).

I stop and I find out where the gas station is, and then I drive straight to it and fill the car.

9887236,comment,9878047,9885065,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Thanks for the post, I was hoping for more discussion of this.<p>I&#x27;d be even more pessimistic about one&#x27;s ability to go forward from empirical observation of opaque mechanisms.<p>Aside from your incisive observations, there&#x27;s the point that if you have a &quot;good&quot; &quot;working&quot; &quot;theory of how neural networks operate&quot;, what is it a &quot;theory of&quot;? It&#x27;s dependent on the mechanisms that gather the test data, the sort of answer that a certain kind of person wants out of the test data and so-forth - the &quot;epistemological&quot; questions you didn&#x27;t answer and couldn&#x27;t answer will come to bite you.<p>I&#x27;d add that SVMs do seem more firmly founded but their ultimate tweak, the kernel trick plus projection onto feature space, is basically ad-hoc too - still much closer to a &quot;real&quot; probability model etc. The problem with SVMs is that they wind-up more or less equivalent to a 1st order neural network and thus they don&#x27;t scale - once data becomes truly huge, they require too much storage.<p>Ironically, I think the best single overall critique of AI efforts was articulated by Paul Allen[1]. The problem is that in building large systems, people encounter a &quot;complexity&quot; barrier that prevents further progress[1]. Creating more complex systems to tackle that tends to fail as people wind-up understanding less and less of their own complex systems.<p>The problems with all the neurophysiological models is that raw neurons are very complex things and one doesn&#x27;t know immediately which parts even carrying meaningful signals, a problem made worse by not having a model of what those &quot;meaningful signals&quot; might be.<p>Consider that if aliens looked at human-made microchips and tried to model them fully, they get the clock signal and various nonlinearities in the transitors right but have enough computation errors that no program would run on it.<p>Another good argument is that just all our methodology hinges on classical Western epistemology and a change in that may be necessary[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-s...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/david-deutsch-artificial-intelligence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/david-deutsch-artificial-...</a>",1436900327

In small doses and in exceptional situations where you walk away from the source, it does indeed seem low risk.<p>I&#x27;m no expert, but I&#x27;ve seen much less discussion and safety study about radiation exposure via intake and biological binding. The pathway of concern there would where dust or other particles of a radioactive substance are spread in an environment, then concentrated via natural means: erosion or biological (e.g. predators taking in prey); then exposed to humans. In that context, even a small amount of bound material may be continuously emitting where one is always getting a dose.<p>We actually take advantage of this pathway for short-lived isotopes for medical procedures, but obviously longer lived isotopes are more dangerous. Most safety in radiation discussions seem to measure the emissive strength, and declare things safe while ignoring the accumulation side of things.

OSM map data was just as good for my purposes at least <i>(arguably better)</i>, but the real motivating factor was just how fucking pathetic Google Maps on Android has become.<p>Just having it find my location became a chore.  I&#x27;d be walking down the street looking at my phone the whole block, waiting for it to get my location.  Many times it would show my location (with several miles of uncertainty) as being somewhere that I had not been for more than several hours.  Other times it would just never find the location at all, not even having any idea what <i>country</i>, let alone city, I was in.<p>I downloaded OSMAnd and the province map data, and it was able to find my location within mere seconds <i>every</i> time.  It was able to do it fast enough that if I clicked the power button as I was pulling my phone out of my pocket, it would have my position before my phone was in front of my face.<p>Unfortunately OSMAnd does not do transit routing, so I was attempting to use both at the same time.  This gave me a direct comparison between how fast both were able to find my position, and how accurately.   OSMAnd <i>blows Google Maps away</i>.  I often resorted to typing in my &quot;from&quot; location in Google Maps, just so that I could use it to find routes for me while it was stalling on finding my location itself.<p>My location permissions were all correct.  I tried wiping the application settings, with no luck.  On the last day of my vacation I uninstalled all the google maps updates on my phone, and tried the version that shipped with it.  It worked just fine.<p>If anybody else ever gets annoyed at Google Maps being unable to find their location in a timely manner, I highly recommend they try OSMAnd.  It saved my vacation.  As a bonus, it even behaves sensibly when on a boat.",1436898708

So Skype will now be <i>forced</i> to fix their backend servers to handle IPv6 connections, or they won&#x27;t be able to ship on iOS9. This way, Apple completely bypassed the need of a transition solution.<p>In fact, iOS support might even be a good global push for companies to transition to IPv6 support (just like Mobile Safari has been for begin dropping Flash and supporting HTML5 videos).

In fact - the society I live in actively punishes those who do not follow this code of conduct. We place them in prisons and have them sign a registry as a &quot;sex offender&quot; where that knowledge is made public and they never live it down for the rest of their lives. We treat sex offenders, in many cases, as worse than <i>murderers</i>.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t prevent people who do not wish to follow this code of conduct from breaking the code of conduct. Education about theft and robbery does not prevent theft and robbery. These individuals <i>do not care</i> about &quot;the rules&quot;. They care about themselves - and not others. Asking them to kindly stop robbing your store isn&#x27;t going to get them to return the items they stole.<p>How does this device buy time?

Are you counting the few seconds before the criminal smashes the alarming/lighting device as &quot;buying time&quot;?<p>It could get help from family/friends, but this is assuming you aren&#x27;t out alone. I imagine most crimes happen &quot;while walking home alone&quot; rather than &quot;walking with my group of friends/family&quot;.

I can order a pizza and call the police about a B&E and the pizza will get to my house first. You&#x27;d have to fix response times - police arriving to the scene of a crime after the crime has been committed isn&#x27;t going to prevent the crime and in many places, the police have terrible response times.<p>The idea of mace, pistols, self-defense courses, etc. Are to <i>prevent</i> the woman from being raped.

Oddly enough, they got this model from the auto industry which did the same sort of model which obviously demands consumers to use the service/good as much as possible.<p>For example, how many patients actually need a CT scan? Not many, really, but if you dig deeper the reason they do this is to get the maximum value of of their CT scan equipment even if a patient&#x27;s symptoms don&#x27;t match anything that would require such a service. Equally, many hospitals also compete with each other thus duplicate services or spend their budget on the look/feel of their facilities (how many people care wth the foyer of a hospital looks like?) which leads to the higher prices. Essentially, each patient pays the full cost of the medical services rendered unlike how consumers in other industries (the price of a meal or a cell phone is not at cost, often it&#x27;s lower when you factor in everything to bring it to market).<p>I think the way to clear the system is to do a multi-tier approach which may include single payer healthcare, but if you were to install that system into our hospital system as is then expect the US to go bankrupt in less than a decade. We have to break the back of the monopolists before we can get anything close to sane market prices.",1436897971

It&#x27;s named PLP 2.0 [2], and it&#x27;s aimed mainly at women that suffer from violent partners.<p>A few friend and I built something similar for a hackathon made by the brazilian Chamber of Deputies on Genre [3]. Our main differentiator was that we didn&#x27;t rely on having a smartphone at all, as our focus was on low-income women in Brazil, which (we thought) is the class that needs something like this the most. Although smartphone use is increasing very quickly in Brazil, only 20% of the brazilians had one in 2014.<p>Ours worked by having a phone number where people would call via a fast-dial number (so it would need just one button press), then it would start recording the audio and send an SMS to NGOs that work with women&#x27;s protection so they could call the cops or whatever was deemed necessary.<p>Obviously, by not requiring a smartphone we wouldn&#x27;t have access to the person&#x27;s location. The solution was based on the fact that ~70% of the attacks occur on the victim&#x27;s home. We would pre-register the person&#x27;s number and addresses (home, work, etc.), so that when we received a &quot;help request&quot;, we would know where to start looking for her.

The more they respect you and what you&#x27;re selling, the more they admire your brand, the lower the rate.

9886867,comment,9886197,9886197,0,0,beloch,,,"One thing that probably confuses many is the mechanism by which ionizing radiation causes cancer.  A lot of non-ionizing radiation, such as visible light, wifi, radio, or infrared, will only excite the molecules in your body, causing an increase in heat.  Obviously, too much heat is bad for you, but it won&#x27;t cause cancer.  It will just cook you like meat in a microwave oven.<p>Ionizing radiation, on the other hand, has a small chance of popping an atom out of a molecule in your body.  It&#x27;s the energy of single particles that matters, not the number of them (although you can certainly be cooked alive by enough ionizing radiation).  If an atom is popped out of the right molecule (i.e. the DNA stored in one of your cells) in exactly the right place (e.g. the portions that suppress out-of-control replication) then you can get cancer.  That mistake in your DNA might be repaired or the cell might simply die.  It might be fine for a while, but that one mistake could lead to compounding errors in future cell divisions, eventually leading to cancer.<p>There are many forms of cancer, but their severity is not a function of how much radiation a person has been exposed to.  Someone with a lot of exposure to man-made radiation sources might get a slow growing tumor in a non-vital area while a person who spent his life a thousand kilometers from civilization could get an aggressively spreading form of cancer in an inoperable area.<p>So, can light exposure to radiation be therapeutic?  Probably not.  If there are benefits to the treatments at Radhausberg, they are likely either due to some other factor or the placebo effect.  The radiation is at a mostly harmless level for visitors, but it&#x27;s not impossible that this could be the place where you get cancer.  I&#x27;d be more concerned for the staff who are exposed year-round.  The exposure received by nuclear plant workers is meticulously monitored and is likely far lower than what the workers at Radhausberg are receiving.  1 mSv is in the range of a medical diagnostic test, but multiply that by 2-3 hundred per year for several years and you get a pretty big dose.<p>Perhaps the most ironic thing related to this story is the fact that background radiation exposure for typical Germans has probably increased significantly in the last few years.  Germany&#x27;s main source of electricity is coal power, and they&#x27;re relying on it more heavily than before now that they&#x27;ve shut down their nuclear reactors. For power plants of the same capacity, radioactive emissions are typically two orders of magnitude higher for coal power plants than for nuclear power plants.",1436897204

I&#x27;m not sure if &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;competition&quot; are the right words, but hopefully my point gets across.<p>Part of the issue is (ironically) well illustrated by OKcupid&#x27;s blog post.^ In it, they basically said that paid dating sites work worse, because they are paid. It&#x27;s a fun pick-a-fight blog, so read it if you&#x27;re interested. Implied (IMO) is that a massive dating site can be run with much lower revenue <i>and</i> be better for users. Doesn&#x27;t matter if they were right.<p>OKcupid had a working unique, effective model and their product <i>was</i> different. Then Tinder do it a totally different way and we have more diversity. The difference are cultural, not just a different feature-set. I think that&#x27;s awesome. But, one business model generates way more money. The others are profitable too and can actually do their job perfectly well (OKcupid anyway) with less revenue. There&#x27;s no inherent reason not to continue existing and letting a thousand (or like six) flower bloom.<p>The problem is that removing company A as a threat is worth more (in dollars) to company B than company A costs. So company B buys OKcupid, Tinder, POF and anything else. The wheels of the market are removing choice.<p>OKcupid still exists.

Paradoxically I think what&#x27;s missing is more manned space exploration - people have a genuine interest in seeing other planets and knowing about space in general, but this interest is tempered by the painful awareness that that we will never get to visit them, so that it&#x27;s like being on an island with a tall tower and a great telescope (through which we can see enticing other places) but no way of building a boat.<p>Of course going into space is so expensive and so few of us would make the cut as astronauts that hardly anyone realistically expects to become a space explorer, but we would like to live vicariously through other space explorers, but this isn&#x27;t possible if our explorers never go anywhere. I think the reason people get so wrapped up in the story of the Mars rovers and the Rosetta/Philae mission was that those probes are the most relateable things since people walked on the Moon in the 1970s.<p>Really, I think we should be doing manned Moon missions regularly. People point out that there&#x27;s nothing on the Moon that we want, which is sort of true (although we&#x27;ve learned so much since the last time we went that we should reconsider that angle) but that&#x27;s a dreadfully consumerist mindset. The Moon is a (relatively) accessible destination that we could use as a proving ground for interplanetary exploration techniques. But more importantly, making regular visits or having a permanent outpost there gives people something to project their imaginations onto (including their political and technological imagination). I have a small collection of old newspapers and my favorite is one published the day after the first Moon landing with the simple headline &#x27;Men on Moon&#x27;. Reading it still gives me a shiver of excitement, followed by disappointment that we abandoned Moon exploration by the mid 1970s.<p>One often-forgotten detail of the Moon landing was that at the time there was a Russian observer spacecraft orbiting the Moon, and it dropped down to within 10 miles of the surface at the time of the landing (presumably to observe what the Americans were up to). I saw Neil DeGrasse Tyson on Charlie Rose last week and he was joking that his favorite daydream is meeting the Chinese President at a conference and persuading him to leak a fake memo saying China aims to land a man on Mars, which would galvanize the American body politic back into <i>serious</i> investment in space.

This knocks out some of the early, hard work of getting competitive hardware at an advanced process node. I&#x27;d like to see two things in this work: microprogrammed variant with an assembly or HLL to microcode compiler; tagged variant like SAFE/CHERI processors with IO/MMU that seemlessly adds & removes tags during DMA. That would be way better for security-critical applications than most of what&#x27;s out there. Multi-core would help, too.<p>Meanwhile, Gaisler&#x27;s SPARC cores are commercial, open-source, customizable, support up to 4 cores in Leon4, integrated with most necessary I.P., and can leverage the SPARC ecosystem. Anyone trying to do an open processor can get quite the head-start with that. A few academic and commercial works are already using it. Plus, the SPARC architecture is open as such that you only pay around $100 for the right to use its name.<p>So, Gaisler&#x27;s SPARC cores with eASIC&#x27;s Nextreme seems to be the best way to rapidly get something going. The long-term bet is RISC-V and they could do well copying Gaisler&#x27;s easy customization strategy. Might be doing that already with their CPU generator, etc: I just read the Rocket paper so far.

1 - immediate life threatening danger, call police (and notify friends/family)

A lot of people don&#x27;t like walking to their car alone at night, or through a dark alley, or meeting someone on a first date.  But they also don&#x27;t want to stream that to their friends/family for no real reason.  This gives them time to stop/erase content where nothing happens.  In the case where something does happen, evidence is still maintained even if the phone is knocked/dropped out of their hand immediately, or whatever.

I too would have loved a public, federated and open API for a &quot;read it later&quot; feature but right now we don&#x27;t have one. The only way to solve this was to build it or bundle some ready made solution. You can ask the Firefox Development team at their mailing list why they chose to bundle Pocket instead of developing a new standard.<p>As for the submission of data, the same could be said for all search engines. A browser is a communication tool, it sends data around. What we need to make sure is that it sends only the data you consent and only when/if you want.<p>Now, lets do a little exercise because you might know more then me about alternatives and I am using this thread to learn new things. If we want a &quot;read it later&quot; feature and we can&#x27;t build our own, what solution you&#x27;d rather have instead of pocket? Is there any other service that you&#x27;re more comfortable with? If you&#x27;re not using Pocket and it is not sending any data because you&#x27;re not using it, having that feature present is actually harming you?",1436896967

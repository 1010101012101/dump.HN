He perceives that as a threat to his own kingdom, he is afraid that your success will overshadow his noise making. He will do everything in his power to keep people mediocre, to make himself look good to his bosses. In all of this a ferevrishly hacking geek churning features, coding by the minute, his way of work, culture and cult is a threat/disease that can destroy the managers career.<p>Why would you continue to work for such a shit manager? My manager is is all about interacting with customers, prioritizing tasks, and shielding us from the bullshit.<p>I suspect that a lot of the difference is in companies where the managers are devs vs MBAs",1341550779

But this is fallacious.<p>We all know about the placebo effect. Do we know the efficacy of homeopathy in the realm of the placebo effect? Perhaps a pill with a bogus (but plausible to the naive) reason has more power than a sugarpill with no explanation at all as to why it works. If so, by some definitions of efficacy (say, ""works better than a sugarpill""), you would have to conclude that homeopathy works (albiet in the context of our world, where many are scientifically illiterate).<p>The universe does not follow our scientific model. Rather, it is always(1) the model that follows the universe. There will always(2) be inexplicable (and apparently scientifically impossible) phenomena, and the purpose of science is to find them.<p>(and also to simplify the axioms.

4206292,comment,4204606,4205525,6,0,rektide,,,"The two reasons I've cooked up for why an audio amplifier is on the unit:<p>1. The device is meant to grow a whole house audio network. Your main A/V system can run the main room, but your Nexus Q devices in your bathroom, your den, and your kitchen ought not all need full AV setups as well.<p>2. One of the main use cases is to offer a digital welcoming mat at your site to anyone who comes by. I'm not sure what the system capabilities are for the Nexus Q, but plenty of tablets and mobile devices have pretty respectable displays: what they lack is speakers, because speakers by their nature are bulky and weighty devices. Nexus Q solves the most problematic part of nomadic computing, adequate sound: the only part of media consumption that is by it's nature required to be a part of the room infrastructure.<p>There's a freebie reason as well: it's cost is close enough to free. The audio chip, TAS5713, is listed as $2.15 in 1k units. They probably had to spend that again to upgrade the power supply, for which 25 of it's available 35 watts are dedicated to audio, and most of that cost gets sunk in larger passive components. The binding posts are probably nearly a dollar. There's a tiny bit more board real estate, a couple more passive components, but those are pennies. The overall cost is, I maintain, slight.<p>Adding more power would've been problematic: bigger power supply, perhaps bigger PCB traces, and the unvented passive-cooling-cum-metal-casing would have needed to be revamped to handle the significant heat-load. After 25 watts, audio goes from being a single chip IC to requiring discrete components, namely cooled and dedicated power switching transistors. 25 watts was as most as could be squeezed in easily.<p>You mention amplifier speakers in your post, ot, but M-Audio AV40's would be my goto compare, and at 20 watts/channel they're A) are not much of an upgrade and b) no slouch in their class, having more watts than many many AirPlay devices. Amplified speakers also create a much more complex wiring scenario: instead of being free to wire speakers wherever, one speaker now wants wall power, and the other speaker has to chain off the first. With an integrated amplifier, speakers are free to be moved into whatever satellite position is desired.<p>12.5 watts is quite a lot of power. It sounds meek compared to the hundred watts of an AV amplifier, and indeed, it won't get ragingly loud on most speaker sensitivities, but it will be loud (buy a Sonic Impact T-Amp and find out for yourself! $35 awesome-sauce battery-powerable mini amp, highly recommended!).<p>I for one think the ability to easily throw up cloud powered bookshelf speakers wherever is really cool.",1341548466

However, of twenty two years in the same organization I've worked in eight different cities in three countries, eighteen years out of and four years in head office.  Despite being consistently ambitious, every single one of my promotions was from my two stints in head office.  And my organization prides itself in believing it has an uncompromisingly objective and merit based promotion process.<p>At best, rigorous reward systems will dampen the natural human bias toward the people you see every day.  Humans are wired to be tribal and to coalese into groups.  Plus, as the parent comments illustrate, there are actual benefits to being in close proximity that can't be replicated remotely.  Were it not so, urban real estate would be no more expensive than rural and there would be no cities.<p>This is not necessarily a bug that needs to be fixed.  Rather, it is a feature of the system to understand and use.<p>If ambition/money is high on your list of priorities, then work in close physical proximity to your peers and bosses.<p>If other things in life are higher on your list of priorities, accept that you are making a trade-off that is right for you.

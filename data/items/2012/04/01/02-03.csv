Investors are interested in getting to know the real you. If you’re a little strange, that’s okay. They like strange. They like people who do things that normal people aren’t capable of, and they know that that capability often correlates with eccentric people. The last thing you want to do is wash away your own personality in some doldrums of blue and khaki.""<p>They also just might want someone who's not afraid to step out of their own comfort zone for two hours.  Seems to me we're getting to the point (or are past it) where ""entrepreneur"" just means ""guy in tennis shoes working on a web service idea"".  Certainly seemed to be the vibe from that piece there.  People are <i>comfortable</i> with 'pitching' <i>all the time</i> - 'pitching' their 'new idea' to 'investors', cause when you're casual like that, anyone could be an 'investor' you can 'pitch' to.<p>Don't get me wrong - there's a lot of hard working people out there working on great ideas (some of them not even involving a web api!).  They're going to go through a hell of a lot of tough times, ups and downs, and doing a hell of a lot of stuff they've never done before.<p>If wearing a suit or tie or keeping your ""weirdness"" in check for an hour are the things that holds your endeavour back from succeeding, you had bigger problems all along.",1333249167

3782475,comment,3781511,3781882,5,0,gruseom,,,"No objection to your second paragraph but I think your first is precisely wrong. It's not a new dress code, same as the old dress code. It's the side effect of a shift in economic relations.<p>Last year a video surfaced on HN about technical founders in the 1970s who would end up with 2% of their companies after taking investment.  From there to, say, Zuck controlling Facebook and wearing hoodies because he likes hoodies is just a massive, massive change. It's happening for historical reasons. And to the extent that Silicon Valley is the avant-garde of the economy at large and YC the avant-garde of the valley, we can project where the trend is headed.<p>A commenter said that Buckminster Fuller preferred informal attire but couldn't get away with it in his day. Technical/creative people haven't changed. What's changed is the balance of power shifting toward them.<p>But the point's not really about clothes, and I feel like the heart of Jason's post got lost in this discussion. You should be who you are, that is, who you really feel yourself to be, because to fake it for the sake of others' approval is to give up your strength and the best things about you. That puts you in a weakened position. Are you going to do as good a job articulating yourself that way? I doubt it. But suppose it works and you get investment from people who wouldn't approve of you otherwise. Then what? Is that a good place to be?<p>Maybe the dude in the story was secretly looking forward to finally getting to wear fancy shoes and a crisp shirt - in that case, more power to him.

Three opinionated co-founders is a crowd; I can't imagine that having more would help. It might work in a case where there is a clear vision is which is shared by all members, but then the product development would already be more-or-less done.<p>There needs to be one founder or maybe two, who can lead the team by earning their trust. Loyal team-members will work like dogs; without that trust/loyalty (which again, needs to be bought or earned) you're herding cats.<p>The GP should find a compatible co-founder.

""Procedural"" still has some potentially scary connotations, but is as least not <i>specifically</i> about computation. The idea is that the general skill of thinking in terms of sequences and processes and systems is a kind of literacy to be fluent with, and that that's not really the same as knowing how to <i>program</i> in particular. But somehow ""computational thinking"" has garnered more press and institutional support, despite being coined several years later.<p>This paper has a nice history of procedural-literacy-esque proposals (disclaimer: written by my grad-school advisor): <a href=""http://dm.lcc.gatech.edu/~mateas/publications/MateasOTH2005.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dm.lcc.gatech.edu/~mateas/publications/MateasOTH2005....</a>",1333248661

Yes, if that can continue but the 200m valuation is much more complicated than applying a 3x multiple on 73m earnings.<p>You have to model out and do a churn and fatigue analysis to get to your top-line volume potential over time (meaning, games like this for example, my friends who used to play 3 hours a day now play 30 minutes a week or just stopped playing... this is in a span of 3 weeks of playing!). What goes up can go down.  Of course Robryan makes a great point about potential synergies but I would imagine synergies can't be that great.  Who plays these games that haven't played angry bird or other zynga games? Only a subset of the population would be incremental new users.<p>What is the average churn rate per week/month?\nWhat is the avg user's playing time per month and trend (trend should go down over time) and one or both of the variables drop by 25-50% more than offsetting any new users added.  Then that 2-3 year payback period to break even now turns into 4-5-6 years.  So then would this game be still popular at all for that many years?  Maybe.  I don't know.<p>What I was pointing out was if somehow some new drawing game like my absurd example becomes more popular over the next 2-4 years then it's got a lot more binary risk embedded in that 200m valuation that most investors are not thinking about or priced in.<p>Now, I don't know how many people are paying members v. ad members.  That may help / not help their case.<p>Hope that clears up any lack of clarity that I provided in my previous post!",1333248509

We should prefer comments which reflect these virtues!<p>However, regardless of what we intend, I think upvoting and downvoting equate to 'I like' and 'I no like'. We should embrace this de facto reality.<p>People, including good people with sound judgments, cannot always explain their choices at the time they make them, nor is this desirable.<p>When people downvote foolishly, in many cases they will have lost their tempers. In such cases sober rules like 'only downvote comments which do not add to the discussion' may go out of the window.<p>This can't be fixed by exhorting users not to get angry or not to comment when angry, for people can be <i>goaded</i> into anger in subtle, malicious ways (which cannot themselves be easily captured and prevented by other rules). And people can <i>deny</i> that they are angry, even to themselves.<p>Anyway, effective rules must remain stable under such conditions, which is no mean task.<p>One way is to engineer new rules into the system itself.<p>For instance, improvement might be brought about if downvoting, in addition to costing the downvotee one point, cost the <i>downvoter</i> one karma point. People would then refrain from frivolous downvoting, but I believe would still downvote inappropriate, thread-damaging comments.

There are two reasons why they don't. One (which applies to only some, like YC) is that they are technical people themselves. The other is that the ones who do it lose to the ones who don't.<p>That is the historical trend and it has little to with fads or fashions.

3782349,comment,3781829,3782264,3,0,mbell,,,"> There are food products that are more chemical than anything<p>The problem is that even this statement is ambiguous.  All foods, processed or not, are almost all chemical by any proper definition of the word chemical I know of.<p>Of course the point your trying to make is that they contain large amount of ""human added chemicals"" some synthesized, some not.  If you look at the ingredient list of a rockstar energy drink you'll find almost everything in it is ""natural"", that is a chemical that exists in nature and is part of a diet that would be considered healthy (in some amount / combination).<p>The argument should really be based on healthy amounts and combinations of chemicals and just because it exists in nature, doesn't make it healthy (see red meat and recent studies regarding it).<p>I find this discussion to be fascinating in regards to evolutionary development.  Humans 'like' sugars and meats for strong evolutionary reasons.  They were rare when the average age of death was like 30.  Getting cheap calories was very beneficial to successful life and hence child bearing in the era.<p>Whats really interesting is that I don't see those traits going away.  Evolution requires selective pressure.  There would have to be a selective mechanism that resulted in those who ""eat well"" to contribute more to the gene pool than those who do not.  While I have no studies at hand to back this up, my personal observation doesn't indicate that this pressure exists.  As a result I don't think we'll see the enjoyment of such food disappear any time soon.",1333245936

Don't hang yourself. New Scala shops should definitely abide by the style guide that is provided at scala-lang.org to help with this.<p>Also, use implicits and multiple inheritance very judiciously. One thing that is quite true from the OP, is that the ""cake pattern"" is indeed ""the bakery of doom"". If you have to use dependency injection, use something sane, like Guice.

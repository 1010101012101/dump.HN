In many ways, for photos, audio and video, rich metadata is more important than the actual data. People use iTunes, iPhoto, Picasa, etc. Enterprises use SharePoint and Filenet.<p>My guess is that at least 80% of that kind of media is managed via applications using specialized apps using metadata.<p>The ""other stuff"" that you speak of isn't equipped with rich and consistent metadata.<p>Think of it this way. Your iTunes folders are exactly the same as mine, there is just a variance in the music that you have. Your photo application is very similar to mine -- the variance will be the degree to which you organize events and add metadata.<p>Other stuff is different. Look at a folder that you use for a specific project. The chances are, you have documents in there created by multiple people. You probably have scanned documents with no metadata. Maybe even spreadsheets with financial data or some code examples. Whatever you have, there is a high chance that it looks completely different from my directory in key ways. Even the metadata may be inconsistent -- I tag some files for searching and add spotlight comments on the Mac. Most of my colleagues do not. The ones that do don't use the same conventions as I do.<p>In the real world, I need to look through the documents about Project X, which was implemented in 2009 to plan for a refresh of the project. The people who were here then are mostly gone. If I'm relying on metadata, how in the hell am I going to find Project X documents? How do I find things when I don't know what I'm looking for.<p>In the physical world, we have drawers, boxes and folders. In the digital world, we have filesystems. That isn't going anywhere, even if Apple decides to drag many people backwards.",1343307430

That comes out to 16-32 hours total, which is just a pitiful amount of time, less than a full time week of work. I just don't think so, unless you really are <i>above-average</i>. After all, it was the basis for many first semesters of CS at MIT, and most (even introductory) CS classes require more dedication than 4 hours a week, and are usually more like 10-12 weeks long.<p>It does depend a lot on your background, because there are large sections of the book that rely on examples taken from electrical engineering and mathematics. These could be tough going if you aren't that familiar with calculus, complex arithmetic, or simple digital circuits. I think it's the biggest flaw in the book, and others have criticized this as well.<p>That said, I really hope not to scare anyone off! You <i>can</i> skip things you struggle with and come back to them, but I do think at least reading the whole thing and <i>attempting</i> all of the exercises is really valuable (there are over 350 exercises, of varying difficulty).<p>So I would try it out, read through the first chapter and see what you think. You may not find it as magical and wonderful as others have, but you might. And you have to ask yourself why you're reading it. You might find that you don't <i>want</i> to bang through it as fast as you can, just so you can tell your colleagues you read it. You might find that it opens up a whole world of alternative programming languages, interpreters and compilers, and it might just be the opening of the rabbit hole, that you won't find the bottom of for years.

He decided to have kids so he has to do anything he can, including any help from any medical office in the world to go on and be there for his kids. If that all fails, sure. But I bet he didn't do that. Like I said; I know kind of a lot of people who did the same thing; you didn't notice anything and most of them NEVER went to a doctor even once about it. I don't know the details of course, maybe he did. One of the suicides I know was a mother of my then girlfriend; she went in and out of clinics (lock up!) and couldn't be cured; she had everything from electroshocks to all anti-depressants; that was understandable. If you cannot live you cannot live. But at least 6 of the 8 I knew intimate NEVER sought help, asked a doctor or showed ANY signs; they were 'happy and smiling' one day, next day hanging from the ceiling. You cannot tell me that's ok if you have kids (or a mother). It's not rational, but it takes YEARS to form a 'tumor' like that and there are definitely enough rational times during that period you could seek help. And not have kids, because you do <i>know</i> you have this tendency.<p>Edit: I am pro euthanasia, but it should be discussed; most cases are fixable, the ones which aren't well aren't.<p>@erre below (I cannot reply): we agree, the moment itself definitely not rational (that's probably why so many people actually change their minds during the fall from the Golden Gate; there is a good documentary about that), however during the years and years of getting to that point there are rational moments. Your friend went to seek help ; that was rational. It does not have to be continues; it's just sad to see how many people do this without ANYONE actually knowing they even had anything like that on their minds. My cousin was an upbeat, happy guy; he was always the most cheerful and nicest person you could have around. He had tons of girls around him and a steady girlfriend. He went for a drive, cheerful as ever, from his house, left a note + a tape for the funeral. No-one had a clue. A forest ranger found him in his car.

4295545,comment,4294041,4294215,3,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>nails, screws, buts, bolts, and coins</i><p>It's interesting, and important, that you read right over the part of the complaint where it is explained that tiny high-powered magnets are <i>qualitiatively different and more dangerous</i> than the other metal objects that children might typically ingest.<p>Why? Because the <i>completely nonintuitive</i> nature of the danger is itself part of the danger. People think these things are less harmful than, say, tiny screws. After all, they're smooth and round and clean-looking. They'll just pass right through, yes? It's not as if humans have metal parts inside for things to stick to, right? You didn't realize the danger. I, until ten minutes ago, didn't realize the danger.<p>But the danger is there. From paragraph 18:<p><i>If two or more of the magnets are ingested [at slightly different times - ed] and the magnetic forces of the magnets pull them together, the magnets can pinch or trap the intestinal walls or other digestive tissue between them, resulting in acute and long-term health consequences. Magnets that attract through the walls of the intestines result in progressive tissue injury, beginning with local inflammation and ulceration, progressing to tissue death, then perforation or fistula formation. Such condition can lead to infection, sepsis, and death.</i><p>I love my buckyballs and I wish I didn't find this argument compelling. But I do. I've dissected intestines (in mice); they have very thin membranes. I've had too many magnets pinch me. I've tried to separate buckyballs <i>on purpose</i> with my fingers; they don't separate by accident. If they capture a piece of tissue between them they aren't coming apart until the tissue dies and a hole forms. If that hole spans your intestinal wall you have a very big problem.<p>Meanwhile, this is apparently not just speculation. There are data. This has <i>actually happened</i>. Presumably it can be made to happen again in laboratory rats if necessary, though I frankly doubt this complaint will get to that point.",1343304044

4295543,comment,4294911,4294911,1,0,Intermernet,,,"My 2 cents (with interest):<p>While I personally do, and always will, store my files in a strict, organised custom folder structure, I understand that many people prefer the ""search for what you need"" paradigm, especially when index and search capability is so impressive on modern hardware.<p>I think that the argument could be made that both Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04 (Specifically Unity) are pushing the afore mentioned paradigm. Having spent some time with both systems it seems faster (but not initially intuitive) to bring up the search box and just type what you want.<p>Applications have been going this way for a while now, including the advanced code completion and suggestion that almost seems to get in the way in modern IDEs.<p>I think what I'm trying to get at is that isn't a purely Apple issue. Google Desktop Search had the effect in my workplace of making many people much sloppier with ""traditional"" filing practices, but seemed to have <i>almost</i> no impact on their overall productivity. The emphasis on ""almost"" refers to the only 2 main problems (from a non-aesthetic, or personal preference point of view) with these systems.<p>Firstly, indexing everything on a modern, multi-TB file system is computationally expensive which-ever way you cut it. This probably won't be a problem if you're just indexing some photos and audio files, but throw some large documents with index-able content in there and it causes slow down on most searches. I've seen this happen on computers of all breeds and creeds, no matter how old, what OS, what hardware. Any poor SysAdmins out there who've ever had to deal with a company director with tens of gigs of email they insist is all ""critical"" will know what I mean.<p>Secondly, sometimes, hopefully not due to fault with the OS's or application's indexing or searching methodology, these indexes get corrupted. When this happens it can be a painful procedure to wait, while an index that took possibly years to build incrementally from a comparatively empty file system, tries to rebuild itself entirely from a very populated file system. None of the searches you do during this time are 100% reliable. I've encountered this on Windows 7 (Mainly because it's the main OS I use at work) but the problem is very difficult to avoid with any large index. Usually these problems occur due to hardware problems so insidious that they tend not to appear in many diagnostic checks. I've had memtest86+ report an error with one particular RAM module only once in 10 runs. I knew there was something wrong with it, every machine I put it into had a BSOD within a few hours ;-) .<p>These problems, although they probably sound like the paranoid troubles of an aging neck-beard (Full disclosure: I have no beard), are actually all too common, and are really the main reason I personally don't trust ""Index and Search"" based systems over the traditional ""File and Find"" methodology.<p>EDIT: I know many people will argue that Moore's Law will solve both of these problems, but I will posit that Moore's Law also applies analogously to used hard disk space.",1343304034

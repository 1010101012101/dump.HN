I am working here and I absolutely do NOT perceive it like that and friends who are also working here confirmed that impression. We are constantly swapping horror-stories of stupid bureaucracy, lengthy extremely bloated processes, having to do things five times, lazy people, stupid people, people who have no idea about their job and no education, tons of stupid ""office wars/games"" going on, lengthy discussions about very petty things and just for the sake of ""but I was actually right"" and so on and so forth...<p>The only conclusion is then, it is much much MUCH worse elsewhere?

But it's true that the government took advantage of the tools offered to the country for free and unchecked by the EU (namely, subsidies and cheap credit lines) to lull people into a false sense of euphoria (To think that in 2000-2007 governments were proud for having the highest-growing economy in the EU (with borrowed money, of course)). There is an issue with EU's general lack of adequate checks on how EU money is spent in individual countries (esp. the south).",1336993156

I've known that I have had things to do, yet instead of doing them I will browse the internet, do other projects or even just sit there doing nothing. I open terminals, long files or emails - just so I can seem busy.<p>In my spare time, I contribute a lot to open-source and I work on a lot of projects in my spare time - I don't think I'm just being lazy as I will work hard in my spare time. I just can't bring myself to work hard at my job.<p>It's becoming more and more stressful as I am unable to complete projects that need to be done. I have a few that are urgent now but I keep putting them off, making up excuses, etc. I've just had yet another given to me. This time with a 3 week deadline. It's stuff I know that I can do and there's more than enough time, but I just can't bring myself to do it.<p>Most days I go home thinking to myself ""I literally did nothing today"". It's depressing and I'm really starting to hate work.<p>Is this burnout or just laziness and how can I tell? What should I do? Should I try and get better or just quit and hope for success at a new position? What if it happens again (I've been fine for the past year or so since I joined my present company, it has just been these past months)? Finally, does anyone else have any experience with burn-out and how did you get over it?",1336993058

You could add a ""blacklist"" of mobile telephone numbers which are known to be agents so if you view a private ad link there should be a link to ""report this as a commercial property agent"" and then after a threshold, mark any scraped ads with that number as commercial.  Some people prefer going directly as the agency fees and service is utter crap and eats into your property budget pretty quick.<p>Add your own private adverts as well so you're the best augmented source of properties there are.  Be the agent :-)<p>Also, don't just target the word ""flat"" - it can be a seen as a negative for non-flats so you're excluding some of your potential already. There is a lucrative market in high end housing which you could charge click-throughs on later to support yourself!<p>Enjoy :-)",1336993042

I don't work for a bucket shop or a commodity hoarding fund. I help supply meet demand and more people have their needs met and better met than otherwise thanks to people like me. There would be a lot more poverty in the world without this industry. In fact, there was a lot more poverty in the world as a direct result of the lack of this level of commerce in the past.

3970406,comment,3969975,3970162,6,0,kahawe,,,"> <i>in Germany it is very, very common to work extra hours that are not paid and not in the books</i><p>I am working in Germany and what are you talking about? More specifically which industry? The employment laws here are so ridiculously pro-employee that I basically need to ""excuse"" and justify myself if I was to work more than X hours a week. And typically, at least in IT, a certain amount of overtime (or a ""flat charge"") is in your contract and you get more salary for that - more than the so called ""collective agreement"" requires your employer to pay you. So for most people in regular jobs, I doubt this holds true. Maybe small IT startups try to squeeze the youngens by circumventing all laws and regulations? At least where I am working, typical German bigger but not huge company, you can set your clock by how punctual they show up to and especially leave work; shortly after 5pm they can start cleaning here because that's when practically the whole building is empty except for some poor souls like me.<p>""High profile"", executive level jobs are different, that is true but this is to be expected at that level and pay rate and I doubt you will find any other country where this doesn't hold true.",1336992829

3970395,comment,3970118,3970118,6,0,MehdiEG,,,"I looked for a flat in London twice in the past year so I've felt the pain and would love to find something that makes the process easier. I'm not sure you're addressing the true pain points though.<p>What I found to be truly nightmarish when looking for a flat was:<p>1) The immense majority of flats listed on rental sites (either aggregators or the letting agencies sites) are either scams, have already been rented or are just baits that letting agencies publish just to get you to ring them so that they can try to sell you the flats they actually have available.<p>The result if that pretty much all the online rental listing websites and apps are nothing more than a spectacular waste of time as every time you find something that looks decent, it's either already gone, it's a scam or it was never available in the first place.<p>2) In a place like London, the rent is only one part of what a flat costs you. Council tax, charges and agency fees are massive and can easily add 20%-40% to the cost of your flat. And these charges can vary a lot from one place to another. Yet, no site ever displays the <i>total</i> cost of a flat. This makes it really hard to compare flats.<p>To address the first point, I always thought that charging <i>both</i> landlords to advertise and tenant to look for flats would cut a lot of the crap.  Landlords should only be able to advertise for a maximum of 3 days (they could pay again to extend for another 3 days). Since tenants have to pay to see the listings, landlords shouldn't get harassed by time wasters. Having to pay to advertise should hopefully keep the scammers at bay. And since landlords have to make the effort to renew and pay every 3 days, it should hopefully reduce the amount of flat still listed but already gone.<p>Of course, it's likely that scammers and letting agencies would quickly find a way around this - but it'd be worth trying. Might not be your space right now since you seem to be focusing on aggregating from existing sites. But if you want to add real value, I really think you need to re-think the way rental sites operate.<p>(as a side note, the only rental site in London I've found not to be a big fat waste of time is <a href=""http://london.spareroom.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://london.spareroom.co.uk/</a> - pay for access to the latest listings and you generally find genuine and good offers that are still available. And it's not just rooms in shared houses - there are actually quite a lot of flats to rent there as well)",1336992554

Happily, the current capabilities of the platform don't preclude this sort of presentation.

3970324,comment,3967396,3967396,16,0,frownie,,,"Just my own experience here. I commute every day, it's a 1 hour train trip in both directions. So I get 2 hours a day just for me. There I work on a side project. It means 8 hours a week. That's not much and a lot at the same time. The intersting thing is that I had to get used to it. Now I just do those two hours no matter what happens. It has become a routine and it's not that exhausting. Also, since 2 hours a day is not much, I have become <i>very</i>  picky about my tools. In a one hour trip, I cannot aford to have my Eclipse to be up and running in 3 minutes => I changed editors. I cannot afford to spend 10 minutes trying to understand code I've written months ago, therefore I write my comments as I should, I write things as simple as I can. Since I only have one hour on a trip, it means I must solve my problems in that hour (if not, the time to start the task becomes too long). Therefore I choose my problems before getting in the train and I use a lot of ""BUG"", ""FIXME"" notes to put aside non urgent matters. I also don't have any web access in the train => impossible to get distracted (but then I need very good documentation to help me out when I need some information). The biggest hurdle to me is that moving from prototype to production-level takes a huge amount of time => sometimes a I set to work in the week end in order to have say 2-3 hours in a row to solve issues spanning across the whole code.<p>About choosing tools. I've selected ruby first, but ruby + Qt is not stable enough (I cannot afford to look for a strange bug in a C++ binding). So I moved to Python where things are better in that regard. I started with Eclipse (because it had a good and free Python IDE) but it takes too long to boot => now I'm in emacs. So although I prefer Eclipse or Ruby, I've deliberately chosen other tools to shave a few minutes here and there.

8279297,comment,8278372,8278372,2,0,wellboy,,,"I&#x27;ve been doing my startup and have been working in companies on and off on the side and to be honest I have a quite strong opinion towards the point of view that people need to collect experience in a company before starting their company. I think this is really bad. More specifically, every single day that you work at a company<p>1. The likelihood of you starting a company and the final size of your company decreases, because every day you learn more about what&#x27;s not possible. Your mind becomes more restricted and corporate experience will certainly not encourage you to invent Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Uber. These ideas can only be done by people who have NO restrictions whatsoever in their minds, who think everything is possible. Corporate life will prevent you from having these ideas and that is why I want to prevent working in a company by all means as long as I can. Which brings us to our second point.<p>2. You get more used to corporate life, which includes receiving a pay-check, which is mostly not based on how much money you made the company, adapting your personality so that you are good in company politics, so that you look good, so that you get promoted, but that&#x27;s actually not good for the company. These learnings are very bad for starting a company.<p>3. You come closer to having kids. I think having kids is probably the biggest factor preventing people from starting companies. Having kids is almost like starting a company, they are your own startup, so having 2 startups is near to impossible.<p>There is some merit in working at a company, to learn about how politics are weaved into corporate life. This helps you to understand that when you need to sell to a larger company that the person you are selling to care much more about how they look by buying your product than how good your product actually is for his/her company.<p>This is why working 6 months does have value, which is how long it usually takes to understand how company politics work. However everything more than 6 months will reduce your capability in starting your own startup, every single day.",1410033472

Float has less than 32 significant binary digits, and Long.max - Int.max has the same MSBs as Long.max. You would need to use Double to see the difference. I&#x27;m not sure what implicit conversions/promotions have to do with that - you want a warning or error when going from Long to Float? That would be reasonable. You can even lose significant digits between Int->Float and Long->Double even though they have the same total number of bits, so you could require those to be explicit.

8279285,comment,8273028,8279097,1,0,findjashua,,,"I would argue otherwise. I think it&#x27;s more important for surgeons to focus on understanding how different organs of the body work with and affect each other, so they can improvise when something goes off-track during a surgery, than on memorizing the name of every bone in the human body.<p>When you understand something, it prepares you better for the situations you haven&#x27;t faced before, since you can formulate results for the new set of conditions. Also, when you look up something frequently enough, it&#x27;s going to get committed to your memory automatically.<p>While I agree that the medical profession requires a higher degree of memorization, the context of my comment (and most others here I&#x27;m assuming) is more geared towards engineering. For example, if I was developing a course on programming, my focus wouldn&#x27;t be on making the students memorize syntax and language quirks, since they can always look those up, and internalize them over time. My focus would be on developing their way of thinking, what&#x27;s the right data structure to use for this problem, should I move this piece of code out as a reusable function, should I return the reference to this object or a copy, etc. This is based on my personal experience - I hardly remember anything from the &#x27;plug-and-chug&#x27; classes which forced memorization.<p>tldr: the focus of education should be to cultivate and encourage understanding concepts, not rote memorization of facts and figures. Some memorization is nice for that extra bit of efficiency, but that is going to happen automatically, so no point going out of your way to do it.",1410033107

They have always had cars, trains, electricity, airplanes.  They were already 30+ by the time videogames and PCs came about, which is why they left them to their kids.

For example, Caltrain knows that they are always behind schedule during rush hour and want to adjust their schedule.

I wish more people would write this way. I know I have a hard time doing it; I want to know that anything I write is novel, which is a crippling and stupid limitation I put on myself.<p>The reality is that one great way to get to novel value is to apply your own take on something that people have done before; you may find a way to teachably express a concept better than others have before you.",1410030770

This shift ultimately seems like one that will only hurt the traditional broadcast networks, as well as the cable networks that fill themselves with &quot;passive watching&quot; content versus the stuff that (currently, at least) plays much better in the newer distribution channels. Or maybe stuff like reality will just move online later when that demographic moves online if cable starts to fail. That&#x27;s probably an area where the &quot;it just works, and it&#x27;s on, set it and forget&quot; aspect of cable is actually a very large advantage, though. Otherwise, about the only non-large-content-library advantage of cable is that fast forward/rewind on my DVR work way better than on online streaming.<p>Extreme space and budget restrictions seem to be the only reason to give up the latter. The couch or recliner + TV viewing experience is hard to do without (I did it for a couple of years after moving and being short on space, and then couldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d done it for so long after getting a TV again).",1410030458

So, the only way to figure things out is to actually be out there doing it.<p>It is very true that you <i>can</i> learn things working for someone else that would contribute to your future startup.

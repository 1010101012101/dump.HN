Yahoo probably won't go under, but what if they need to make drastic cost cuts and decide to cut off the YIM service?<p>Probably better off running your own XMPP server and rolling your own client.

Desktop environments, database engines, programming languages, text editors.<p>The author of vim told me that at one point he felt pretty content with the program and had not been changing much for a number of years.  Then some other guy took on a very active development of another vi clone (forgot the name, sorry) and this gave Bram the incentive to speed up and add many new features to vim.  So in this case the competition was beneficial, and I expect that it usually is.<p>And BTW I don't think competition in science is primarily driven by funding.  You need little or no funding for theoretical physics, and yet they're as competitive as anyone or more.  The main reason for the very fierce competition in science IMO is that the number of tenured positions is very small compared to the number of PhD graduates.

588019,comment,587831,587853,0,0,anuraggoel,,,">  presumably, only one of the parties has agreed that the information should be public.<p>Sending an email like this to Arrington and telling him he might find it 'interesting' amounts to saying 'print this'. Further, all involved parties in a story do not have to agree before it's published. If an employee is harassed by her manager, does the NYT seek the manager's permission before publishing the story? I have indulged in TC-bashing on several previous occasions, but I don't think expecting Arrington to keep this stuff confidential is reasonable under the circumstances. If anyone's to blame, it's Goodrich.<p>And as far as Arrington's reputation is concerned, I don't think it's going to take a hit - he's a 'journalist' and he has to make a living =) It might actually save him some trouble because now people are going to think twice before sending him 'interesting' crap.",1241147610

I think we'll both agree that we can and should keep our transactional data normalized.<p>Either way, this method goes against the grain of what SQL is supposed to do (otherwise you could meta-program queries without having to resort to a Perl script to string this thing together).  My critique still stands that these queries can grow to intractable sizes.<p>If one is going to be a lot of reporting like this, they should really look to separate their transactional and analytical databases.<p>But hey, like I said YMMV.  In a simple case it works.  But trust me when I say, after 5 years of data growth and requirements shifts, I wish I knew then the burden that it is now. :)",1241147466

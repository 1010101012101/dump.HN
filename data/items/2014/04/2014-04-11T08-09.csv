So when I&#x27;m at the beach or having a break or sleeping and that my computer is off AND Skype is not running, I should not be online, well just because I&#x27;m not!<p>As you can imagine this can have some annoying side effects, like your girlfriend not responding to your message, or your boss thinking you are working 24h and telling you &quot;You should rest!&quot;.<p>And don&#x27;t tell me I need to disconnect from each of my devices to be actually offline, because I&#x27;m offline as soon as I step away from my computer.

Nevertheless, I was vaguely aware of this moral hysteria going on in the background, and had the same innate sense of ridiculousness of it all at age 6 or 7.

I suppose politics are no less ridiculous today, but I think with the crumbling of the Soviet Union there was a real vacuum for common fears and the political machine was a bit out of practice to raise a credibly amorphous spectre such as &quot;terrorism&quot;.",1397206323

So you can start with a bit of Ruby/C/Python, translate it to Rust and presto, all your bugs are exposed for the world to see.<p>In practice Rust&#x27;s type checker accepts only a _very_ small subset of correct programs. I&#x27;ve been in a position to write some decent sized Rust code recently and it takes a shift in your mindset to start writing decent Rust code.<p>Even now there are patterns I&#x27;m unsure how to model in Rust. Arena allocation is a good example because it was partly the cause of Heartbleed too. Arena allocation in rust seems to require unsafe pointers and unsafe code blocks. You can look at Rust&#x27;s standard library and see this.<p>2. The point being that the Rust language exposes unsafe code blocks and pointers. At some point you&#x27;re going to hit those blocks (if nothing else in 3rd party code) and you&#x27;re back to square one: You need to trust unsafe code that it is correct. It doesn&#x27;t matter if that code is a VM or unsafe code.<p>*edited for some legibility.",1397205385

Since the missile would be launched from U.S. territory and had to fly low over America&#x27;s allies in order to avoid detection on its way to the Soviet Union, some military planners began to wonder if it might not be almost as much a threat to the allies. Even before it began dropping bombs on our enemies Pluto would have deafened, flattened, and irradiated our friends. (The noise level on the ground as Pluto went by overhead was expected to be about 150 decibels; by comparison, the Saturn V rocket, which sent astronauts to the moon, produced 200 decibels at full thrust.) Ruptured eardrums, of course, would have been the least of your problems if you were unlucky enough to be underneath the unshielded reactor when it went by, literally roasting chickens in the barnyard.&quot;",1397203814

For that you&#x27;d need to look at the code generated.<p>Even if there is a 0 performance hit in this case, the majority of &#x27;safe&#x27; languages are neither pre-processors for C or code generators for a C like language (which would presumably also require the linked libraries to be re-written using something safer).<p>So in the specific case outlined here this may be true but in the more general case there are usually run-time trade-offs involved.<p>I think the key operative word in your comment is &#x27;correctly&#x27;, writing correct C is extremely hard and this approach makes it harder to create a certain class of bugs at the expense of making it harder to write the program in the first place.

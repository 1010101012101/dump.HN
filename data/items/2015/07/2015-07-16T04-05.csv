They know where the money is coming from and if the company has good incentive structures (ie. equity) want to make sure revenue grows as well.<p>Fortunately, developers are also aware of the cost which is associated with every third-party tool included on the page. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s really important to include someone technical in any deal conversation as early as possible, and they need to have the ability to block a deal which would substantially degrade the user experience. They can also weigh different providers by their implementation cost to users, which is crucially important: a sales guy loves to hear &quot;just one line of JS&quot; but I&#x27;d much rather use a REST API.<p>The key to getting this sort of control and buy-in is demonstrating to management the fact that page load time has a direct effect on traffic (and thus revenue).",1437022545

He faced a deportation order that would have sent him back to Belarus. Representing himself in immigration court, he argued that he risked torture if sent home, based on his run-ins with the KGB. As a signatory to the U.N. Convention Against Torture, the U.S. cannot send someone back to a country knowing he’s likely to be tortured. An immigration judge sided with Naskovets. The government appealed.
Here’s where Naskovets’s optimism proved justified. While he was buffing floors in a county prison in Pennsylvania, his case had caught the attention of Stephen Yale-Loehr, a law professor who runs an immigration clinic at Cornell. With the help of Yale-Loehr and his students, Naskovets fought Immigration and Customs Enforcement in court for two years—and in October 2014 the agency decided to let him stay.",1437022036

That leaves you with what&#x27;s essentially a template matching type of problem for each of the three areas where the signal is showing above noise levels of activity. The first and last region don&#x27;t match the decaying exponential well and the middle one matches it fairly well with 3 distinct events.<p>That said, this approach introduces what may be more latency, coding complexity, and computational work than is desired.

Since graduation I've realized that I actually love learning - it's probably my greatest drive. School never failed me academically, but I picked up some unhealthy attitudes about trying and learning and succeeding which I've been trying to unlearn since. Lessons like:<p><pre><code>  1. It is NOT ok to fail.\n  2. Pointless exercises ARE ok - live with it.\n  3. Don't ask why; just memorize the facts you'll be tested on. \n  4. Your uniqueness is a liability not an asset.\n</code></pre>\nI need to add that I did have lots of fantastic teachers, many of whom expressed the grace the OAP articulated. I also realize that many young people have a fantastic experience in the current system.",1358596198

5083148,comment,5079787,5081766,4,0,jwhite,,,"To elaborate on what tedunangst said, for those less experienced with C:<p>To some extent it's a matter of nomenclature, but one can draw a distinction in C between arrays of arrays and 2D arrays.  It does matter.  The following is an array of arrays of ints (a ""ragged array"" as tedunangst mentioned), if I malloc an array of pointers to ints and then add a loop that mallocs an array of ints for each a[i]:<p><pre><code>  int **a;\n\n  a = malloc(N * sizeof(a[0]));\n  int i;\n  for(i = 0; i < N; i++)\n  {\n      a[i] = malloc(M * sizeof(a[i][0]));\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThen a[i][j] picks out a single int from the array of arrays.  The layout in memory is then like this:<p><pre><code>      +--+--+--+-       -+--+\n  a:  |  |  |  |   ...   |  |   (array of pointers to arrays of ints)\n      +--+--+--+-       -+--+\n        |   |\n        |   |\n        |  +--+--+--+-       -+--+\n  a[0]: |->| 1| 2| 3|   ...   |  |  (array of ints)\n           +--+--+--+-       -+--+\n            |\n            |  +--+--+--+-       -+--+\n  a[1]:     |->|41|42|43|   ...   |  |  (array of ints)\n               +--+--+--+-       -+--+\n    .\n    .	\n    .\n</code></pre>\nNote that you cannot rely on these arrays to have any relationship with each other in respect to their positions in memory.  That's entirely up to malloc(3).<p>However, the following is a 2D array of ints:<p><pre><code>  int a[3][4];\n</code></pre>\nThe same syntax as before can be used to pick out one of the ints in the 2D array:  a[i][j].  But this time the C standard gives us that this object is laid out in memory in row-major order.  So if you initialize it like this:<p><pre><code>  int a[3][4] = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, { 5, 6, 7, 8 }, { 9, 10, 11, 12 } };\n</code></pre>\nthen its memory layout looks like this:<p><pre><code>      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+\n  a:  | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|\n      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+\n        ^        ^  ^        ^  ^        ^\n        |__a[0]__|  |__a[1]__|  |__a[2]__|\n</code></pre>\nThis means you can index it manually like this:<p><pre><code>  int x = *((int*)a + i * M + j);\n</code></pre>\nwhere M is the length of each row, in this case M==4.  You can't do that with the ragged array-of-arrays.<p>Exercise: try taking sizeof(a) in both cases, as suggested in the grandparent.<p>Exercise: 3D arrays?",1358594955

I think I'm fine with my ""design"" seeming old-fashioned or even primitive as opposed to being hip; I genuinely like bevels and gradients, I'd use them if nobody else did, and now I can finally prove that haha (though when everybody used them, there was <i>so</i> much to learn from, so I'm glad that happened ^^).",1358594150

It's a whole different story to get an average gamer to use it. These are the same distrustful stubborn people who have been getting hacked for decades by giving up too much personal information. In addition many gamers don't want their game identity anywhere near their real identity. This is compounded by those same gamers being the most active participants and most ardent in their attempt to separate game and real identities.<p>Now - even though technically they should prefer openid over normal login - that doesn't mean they'll roll with it. There is a lot more involved in making a decision when it breaks convention like their login.<p>Clearly I prefer the direction that HN and most other startups are going - away from openid.

But, in Confluence, this outputs two newlines. Yes, double-backslash is the symbol for a newline.<p>Counter-intuitive, yes, but no worse than that so long as there's another symbol you can use for when you do need a double-backslash. But, the thing is, there isn't. When Confluence was first designed, they used up their <i>only</i> escape char with their nonstandard newline symbol. This is, their support staff informed me, a deep-rooted and unchangeable aspect of how Confluence works.

856403,comment,856317,856394,0,0,sachinag,,,"Well, they got in on the merits.  It certainly wasn't like HP demoing a new product (like we saw at DEMO); it was a company coming out for the first time.  It certainly qualifies as a startup in my mind.  It may be a $20M company, but still, <i>no one had ever heard of them before</i>.  The look of astonishment on the panelists' faces was awesome.<p>It may very well have been the greatest gambit to create a competitive bidding process for VC investment in history.  Seriously.  They presented at TC50, and in less than a month, had a VC firm who they had absolutely no prior relationship with wire $25 million to their account.  (Sure, they had previously raised $3.5 million, which marked the IP as safe and the revenues as real, <i>but still</i>.)<p>Hats off to Yext, as far as I'm concerned.",1254455603

856396,story,,,1,3,adriand,"Ask HN: how do you keep up with your inbox?",,"I saw a comment just now that said Google Wave might be tough for people who already have trouble keeping up with their inbox.  I never really considered the idea that I might not be the only person who is having trouble staying on top of email.  This seems absurd, but most people I know don't seem to have this problem, although I don't think they get as many emails as I do.<p>I estimate I get approximately 100 emails per day, many of which don't just require a reply, they also require me to do something (I'm a web developer and project manager).  I'm sure others get more emails than this (and perhaps manage it fine), but I'm finding it increasingly difficult to read and respond to emails in a timely fashion.  I'm also finding that email has become disruptive to my ability to get other things done.  I often have to open my email to either send emails or to retrieve information, which means I always see all the mail and feel compelled to deal with it.<p>At this point I'm feeling like various technological solutions (labels, stars, etc.) just aren't cutting it.  I am tempted to just start letting certain emails slide, which bothers me from a customer service point of view.  What have you found helps you manage the constant barrage of emails?  Is there a solution or are we just stuck dealing with this incessant flood of email?",1254454958

856387,comment,856301,856340,0,0,hristov,,,"There may be legal recourse but the legal system moves so slowly that in Internet time you are pretty much screwed. So in the beginning stages it may be a good idea to keep copies of all software, data, etc. close just in case one gets locked out of the servers.<p>I know of this one company that decided to move their servers out of a collocation facility. The collocation facility hated to lose a good customer so they just locked the company out, disconnected the servers and did not let the company get to them. But they helpfully offered to reconnect the servers if only the company would sign another long term contract. The litigation took many years, so the data on the servers was pretty much lost for all practical purposes.<p>So yeah ... keep backups and keep them where you can get to them if the s hits the fan.<p>Regarding the domain name ... I suppose one person needs to have control of that, no way around that. Well, it is possible to set up a trust where an impartial party (such as an attorney or a professional trustee) controls the domain name according to a previous agreement between the founders, but if you have to resort to this, there is probably not enough trust to do a startup.",1254454487

856346,comment,855588,855833,0,0,dlwh,,,"Successes in Speech, Machine Translation, medical diagnosis and data mining successes have all descended from sound theoretical research in statistics and information theory.<p>For instance, Machine Translation (as we know it today) was originally inspired by the ""noisy channel"" for speech recognition that is based on Bayes Rule. In speech recognition, the probability of some words given some input waveform is proportional to the probability of someone saying those words times the probability of hearing some wave form given those rules. The same model led to statistical machine translation: if I speak to you in French, what I'm really doing is speaking to you in English, but the ""channel"" is so noisy that it comes out sounding like French.<p>Today, the parallels are less clear (for instance, German and English have substantially different word order, and in speech you don't usually have reordering in the channel--though there's actually some cool new research in MT to bring it closer in line with modern speech processing!).<p>Yes, there are huge amounts of specialization and hacks for each of these fields, but they are (mostly) based around core good statistical ideas.<p>In fact, some people are worried that the AI community is so focused on log-linear models and the like that we're in some kind of local minimum, and that we're unlikely to work our way out any  time soon.<p>That said, Kurzweil is still wildly deluded, as you suggest.",1254452653

Is there any way we can avoid ever having that kind of situation with a clever bit of legalese?""<p>Unfortunately, I suspect the answer is ""no"".  As soon as you give one partner the ability to eject the other (for <i>whatever</i> reason), you open the door for all sorts of abuse.  Besides which, if a partner wants to cause chaos and destruction, you're in for supreme nastiness, regardless of the legal situation.<p>So, at the end of the day, I think the best you can do is choose your business partners carefully, keep things above board, and do the best you can to behave morally and ethically.  That way, even if things go to shit, hopefully you'll still be able to walk out with your head held high.<p>I'm sorry Fundable went out this way.  Sounds ugly as hell.",1254452578

I'm working since a while now with one of my talented friends on a carpooling website for both users and companies, with a lot of fancy features,
Until there it was only a toy, spent some long nights to talk about it, but now the development began with already some cool stuff even if we are far from the end.<p>Do you think a ""carpooling"" market really exists ? Do you know companies that could pay for this ?<p>Thanks for your feedback,

I love how it has a factual title, giving some concrete numbers, then goes on to give no specific derivation for those numbers at all.<p>And then there are sentences that don't even make sense like ""In the US investors lost millions of dollars and when the “big guys” that share prices reached completely unrealistic levels far from what economists call fundamentals.""<p>How did this turd get 10 points here?",1203901132

There is a Darwinian process at work that culls the old and dying, and new and ineffective companies from the herd.  It is only a matter of time before someone does make a better bug tracking system with a great cash flow.<p>Young lions challenge the old alpha males for dominance of the lion pride.  Startups challenge and overtake the old companies for dominance in the business.  Startups often win unless they get acquired by the old, and there are many other startups that die.  That's the way the business works.  There are precious few companies that have been able to stay on top for more than 10-20 years. Natural selection is a very powerful force in the startup economy.",1203901097

Is Trends displaying the result of an algorithm for term popularity and not just number of searches?<p>I know these are also skewed because of other reasons people would search for these terms (ie, ""ruby"", ""python"", ""java"", or ""arc"").  But the graph of a term that's unlikely to be confused with something else (""Ruby on Rails"") seems to make sense in terms of what the number of searches ought to be.",1203900985

Leni Riefenstahl was one of the most influential modernist directors. Rudolf Laban is taught to acting and dance students today.

Nowadays, we have huge blockbusters that regularly surpass 250 mil every season.  Even though we have DVDs and can download copies (pirated or not), collectively, we're spending more on movies than we use to.<p>However, we don't know whether that's due to more people going to see movies, or merely just an increase in ticket prices.  It'd be more interesting to see the graph adjusted for this so we can see if more or less people are going to the movies than before.<p>It also seems that movies that are series get a second hump, like Jurassic Park III, Harry Potter, etc.<p>IMAX movies have a looong shelf-life, compared to all other movie types.

At the presentations and nightly convocations, they were giving out as the door prizes: 'Programming Ruby' books. And the presenters/organizers gushed 'it's really cool, the next big thing. Ruby is it'. That was seven or eight years ago.<p>While Ruby broke out with Ruby on Rails, Java is firmly entrenched and as someone who is trying to learn Ruby/Ruby on Rails - I'm finding the learning curve painful as Ruby/Ruby on Rails is more than just a syntax or a language it's a different way of doing things. We're trying to justify a small project (business case) but even though the application we are intending to build is perfect for RoR - they are almost like why not Spring/Hibernate/Flex.<p>I believe many Java programmers are happy that Java is a near default language for a lot of non-startup IT/software shops - you can't learn Ruby on Rails from a 5-day bootcamp.",1203898260

Here&#x27;s how it looks to me:<p>1. You have to arrange your life around the schedule. The buses, OTOH, don&#x27;t. Last winter it was not uncommon to wait half an hour with no shelter or place to sit, in below-freezing weather, for a late bus. The bus I get on in the morning has tended to be five to ten minutes late (which means delays for transfers), and once pulled in shortly before the bus making the next scheduled stop.<p>2. Once the bus does arrive, there may or may not be a seat available.<p>3. If the buses have shock absorbers, I&#x27;ve not seen or felt evidence of it. The driver&#x27;s seat, OTOH, is quite the technological miracle of jerk (in the physics sense) minimization.<p>4. The buses aren&#x27;t designed to accommodate any items a passenger might be bringing along.<p>5. The bus driver sometimes either can&#x27;t or doesn&#x27;t bother to set the bus&#x27;s identification of itself (to potential passengers via signage or to apps). It&#x27;s a good way to make people miss their buses.<p>I can only describe my experiences with the Allegheny Port Authority, others may differ. When I&#x27;ve called, the recording describing the menu runs at VERY low volume, perfect for trying to get help on a busy street with traffic noise. When I got through and described the issue, I was asked if I wished to register a complaint. I did; I think I may have gotten a followup on it once. OTOH, that&#x27;s not been as much of an issue lately, because now you can only call between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., just the thing for avoiding people having problems during the morning and evening commute.<p>I will celebrate when mass transit is disrupted out of existence.",1448523688

10631790,comment,10631513,10631677,0,0,Animats,,,"In QNX, the serial console, if present, is managed by a driver in user space, loaded with the kernel as part of the boot image.  That&#x27;s how all initial drivers in QNX start up. For embedded systems, the serial console driver might not be loaded, or could be a special-purpose driver for the hardware.  The user mode driver is used for any messages during boot; there&#x27;s no special startup-time kernel driver.<p>The boot image may be in ROM, and on small embedded devices, it usually is.  For QNX, disks and file systems are optional.  If disk support is desired, some disk drivers and an init program are included in the boot image, and the later phases of startup are somewhat UNIX-like.<p>It&#x27;s possible to build a QNX boot image so that networking comes up before the file system, which is useful for headless embedded systems.  It&#x27;s also possible to build a classic system for x86-type BIOS-controlled boot from disk, and run QNX on the desktop, but that&#x27;s not done much any more.",1448523648

In the case of a given coin, and a controlled <i>sequence</i> of flips, we can ask <i>different</i> questions, like what is the probability of heads following heads vs, heads following tails? (Eg: when a certain experimenter flips the coin, do the side that is up at the start of the experiment affect the outcome?

10631775,comment,10631008,10631651,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Even if you ignore the extra walking required, and even if public transit actually gets you close enough to your destination, public transit at least doubles the travel time required.  Potentially more if your drive doesn&#x27;t need to deal with traffic, which it often doesn&#x27;t.<p>Random example: in the Portland area, a city known for both public transit and pedestrian/bike friendliness, I looked up routes from my current workplace to the university building I took most of my classes in, via either a car or public transit.  Despite having a train line that handles most of the distance, that trip would take at least 90-100 minutes, depending on time of day.  That assumes you start your trip at a time that doesn&#x27;t require waiting for the first pickup.  The same trip by car would take 25-40 minutes, depending on traffic.  And with a reasonably fuel-efficient vehicle, the trip would cost less in gas than the cost of the transit fare.  On top of all that, you can leave when you want to leave, not worry about which bus or train you need to catch, and not worry about getting stranded when the buses and trains shut down for the night.<p>This isn&#x27;t an issue of worldview; by any almost objective measure, a car beats public transit, here in one of the most transit-friendly cities in the country.<p>(In the interests of a fair comparison: public transit does work better if you don&#x27;t have the option of using a car, such as if you can&#x27;t afford one, or if you have some legal reason you can&#x27;t drive.)<p>Adding more public transit vehicles or routes wouldn&#x27;t solve this problem, because the current set of vehicles aren&#x27;t actually at capacity; by measures of <i>throughput</i>, they carry all the passengers that want to ride.  However, by measures of <i>latency</i> and similar metric, public transit utterly fails.<p>Perhaps if you somehow convinced the entire population to use public transit, then you could put many times the number of public transit vehicles on the road without wastefulness, and partially solve the latency problem.  But you&#x27;d have a lot more luck convincing people to use a fleet of self-driving electric cars instead.<p>I would welcome a similar latency-based comparison in a more transit-friendly area, as long as the comparison shows transit infrastructure getting better to compare well with cars, rather than driving infrastructure getting worse while transit stays the same.",1448523290

Utilitarian ethics come down to cost-benefit analysis, but that&#x27;s only for people who are perfectly rational. Even then, this really only works for a definition of rational that comes down to essentially evaluating mathematically the costs and benefits of things without accounting for inherent irrationality.<p>To complicate the (overplayed) trolley car problem and perhaps see what I&#x27;m thinking on this subject, consider it likes this:<p>If instead of one person you had push two skinnier people instead of one fat person onto the tracks to save the other four, would it change the decision you made? If you do nothing, the trolley driver is responsible for the involuntary manslaughter of four people but you are innocent. If you push two people, you are guilty of the voluntary manslaughter of two people and will serve 50 years in prison.<p>If there was only one person to push, you would serve 25 years in prison for their voluntary manslaughter. But does this affect whether or not you push people? I doubt it. From a selfish point of view, the best course of action is to not do anything. However, I suspect that for people who are willing to kill fewer people to save more, the number killed does not matter so long as more are saved.<p>Applying the law to an ethical thought experiment is inherently fraught and I don&#x27;t mean to imply that this is an academically defensible suggestion however I hope it serves to illustrate why I don&#x27;t agree with you.",1448521778

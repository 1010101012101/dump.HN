But while there might be restrictions on what applications can be made, Apple hasn't said they will restrict free versions of other people's software. I mean, sure, you can't probably get Firefox on your iphone, but if people wanted to get together and create a free version of an application that someone else is selling, sort of like Open Office vs. MS word, I don't see that being shot down. The author implied that would never be allowed, but I don't see why not.<p>He is correct though, and I acknowledge, that Apple is a closed system. There probably won't be more than one web browser on the iPhone, or more than one music player. Some applications there won't be open source or free versions of. But as many people have said, they are perfectly fine with that. If you want to play OGG files, buy a different phone.<p>I think what the author fails to note is that its unlikely there will ever be a completely closed industry again. Apple may not allow some free apps, but someone else will. Gone are the days where every choice in an industry was closed or propriety.

Indeed the answers are much further in.<p>The first observation I would make is that 'diverse' is a missleading or very loose term, actually I believe you can seperate people into about 12 archetypes and 3 sub groups.<p>The 2 most interesting of the 12 would be the supreme achievers and the tyrannical controllers. Then the 3 subgroups could be summarized as follows: 80% rabbits, 10% rogues, 10% rebels.<p>Understanding the general nature of 'diverse' groups helps to get a better understanding of how symbiosis is achieved (where game theory is on display at its most elegant).<p>Richard Dawkings and JMS both strong believers of the 'Evolutionary stable strategy' and this again is a concept that lends much insight into the nature of how complex game theory leads us to symbiosis. (When I say symbiosis I am really talking about a stable and healthy society.)<p>The main player in this game which is most interesting and has been emulated by Google is Paul Erdos and the concept of the Erdos number, more widely known as the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.<p>Once one understands this concept and the nature of a linked network, or a scale free network then it starts to come together.<p>The main tenets of survival past these emending disasters are relatively simple but will be intolerable to many who currently exploit man and nature for their own gain.<p>Essentially, understanding game theory and the above other aspects of this 'game' then one can only come to one conclusion, that is that the only game that we can play to get us to a point of stability is 'Nice'. Nice = playing fairly and not exploiting the opponents. As opposed to 'Nasty' cheating to get ahead. Of course a really strong legal system would be needed to be built.<p>To boil it down to simple bullet points: The following would need to be adopted in order to create the symbiosis that I have referred too:<p>A) A new legal system built from the ground up, (not the top down) that stated as its main most fundamental laws: \n1) thou shall not levy distress upon another/nature in order to achieve success.\n2) thou shall not exploit another's distress.<p>B) a new monetary system that served as a loans / tax / fines / benefits system.<p>c) a new political system whereby there is no central leaders (no central inland revenue) that dictate according to being granted power based on 'democracy' or trust, rather a sort of stock market for leaders whereby voters had constant ability to change allegiance and are not subject to fixed term contracts of 5 years etc.<p>These are basic tenets that are needed to achieve an economic stable society and are perfectly possible to implement, of corse in practice there are many powerful players who are too busy exploiting people and the planet who would fight vigorously to avoid such a system.",1215792546

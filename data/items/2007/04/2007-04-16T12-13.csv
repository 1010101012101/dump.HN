However it makes much more sense for Netflix: prize is $1m, they are an established company, and recommendation system is important but not the core of what they do.<p>I will go ahead and download the corpus though - the problem is interesting and you can't easily find datasets like this.<p>Edit: Anyone care to post it as a torrent?

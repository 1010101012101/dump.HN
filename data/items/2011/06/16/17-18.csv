Pretty much everyone who's knowledgeable about nuclear power has a stake either way.<p>There are two competing effects at work here, and it's hard to say which is strongest: If you are biased one way or another, you probably will put more effort into finding facts that support your view. That doesn't mean that those facts are wrong or that you are being disingenuous, just that you have acquired a self-reinforced, biased view of the world. And <i>then</i> you may of course also be selectively reporting those facts known to you, which is more dishonest.<p>But saying this argument is like pointing out ""motive"" in a trial seems like a stretch. Motive would usually include financial or other similar types of gain. If saying things you believe are right makes you liable to a charge of having motive to lying just because you have an opinion, then you can't trust anyone except completely ignorant people, which is not a step forward.",1308246993

Skype uses VBR to make sure they pack enough fidelity while maintaining the low bandwidth requirements.<p>It is an interesting paper to read. Initially I thought they exploited LPC which is the base for all our mobile communications as well. As long as VOIP provider doesn't opt for VBR compression, their networks are immune from this attack.<p>From the paper.<p><i></i><i>Under VBR, the size of the codebook entry,\nand thus the size of the encoded frame, can vary based\non the complexity of the input frame. The specication\nfor Secure RTP (SRTP) [3] does not alter the size of the\noriginal payload; thus encoded frame sizes are preserved\nacross the cryptographic layer. The size of the encrypted\npacket therefore reects properties of the input signal; it is\nexactly this correlation that our approach leverages to model\nphonemes as sequences of lengths of encrypted packets.</i><i></i><p>Also, they included the solution.<p><i></i><i>For this reason, the use of constant bit-rate codecs is important to consider as an alternative to simple block ciphers for VoIP, since such codecs might improve call quality given a relatively large xed packet size. Another alternative might even be to drop\nor pad packets [19, 27, 57], though, in that case, the effect on perceived call quality is unclear. We note, however, that VoIP providers have made no move to employ any such measures:\nSkypes SILK, for instance, is a VBR codec. Similarly, one of the leading proposals for 4G, the LTE Advanced standard, species a VBR codec for audio [1] and the use of SRTP\nto secure voice data channels.</i><i></i>",1308246810

2662373,story,,,5,6,fieldforceapp,"Ask HN: 1000 signups a week, but how to gain long term engagement? ",,"Hi, HN frequent reader, infrequent poster looking for advice.<p>After an embarrassing first release, and an awesome UX/UI redesign of our cloud-based iPhone app, we're pleased to be getting a steady 1000 signups a week on our free app. But we're stumped on how to turn this initial interest into long term engagement for our group productivity app.<p>The engagement funnel looks like this: we don't advertise much (ad words isn't working for us, banners perform better and in-app ads are ok but not for our target audience: professionals) so through self-driven discovery these new users are coming to us based on App Store searches: Group Messaging, Productivity, Real-time Messaging, Shared Contacts, Shared To-Do's seem to be what's drawing people in. Users have described it as a ""peer-to-peer CRM,"" or an ""Evernote for Contacts,"" or a ""Basecamp/Highrise for those who don't know what Basecamp is!""<p>Next, after installing the app, the sign-up process is easy but we require an email + password based authentication because we support invitations and only want to send out trusted invites. We also give users the options to choose an avatar, and activate location & push notifications. The point is, it's time consuming. Which means the initial engagement, the expectation anyway, is high. About 75% of users are uploading custom avatars. About 80% of users confirm their email address (two-step process).<p>Last, we offer users an option to invite teammates from either their LinkedIn or Twitter social graph. Again, we're focused on professional users so we avoided Facebook integration. You can also invite teammates later, by email. Perhaps this is our first indication that something's wrong because very few people are using LinkedIn or Twitter invitations.<p>Finally, users enter the main features of the app. We measure engagement here and find roughly 60% of users create some form of content (Contacts, Status Update, To-Do Item, etc.) so they take the first step.<p>And then we lose them.<p>We have about a 35% retention rate the first week, higher in Asia, and then dropping from there. Very few respond to follow-on email prompts or push notifications. They just fade away. Leaving behind a ghost record of their effort & aspirations. Clearly, they were looking for something else. But they signed up, and shared very private info in the hopes of what?<p>And for those of  you who've read this far, I'm hoping that you've had similar experiences yourselves and overcome them. Whether for a web or mobile app, how have you driven engagement?<p>Thanks,\n--ff<p>PS: I don't think the discussion above is specific to an app, but for reference here's ours:\nhttp://fieldforceapp.com<p>PPS: Holding back on using real names 'cause I obviously can't quit my day job with these numbers!",1308246440

Thus if you happen to be at a distance where you're getting a half revolution, you'll throw from the knife blade, or turn the axe around (so it's pointing towards you on throw).  That enables it to hit the target the right way around.

I <i>wish</i> they would, but for some reason they (all non-techy people) are on facebook every day but if they have a Twitter account at all, it's little-used and dormant.<p>It's rather easy to 'get' facebook, since it's pretty much a mish-mash of various communication technologies that have already proved themselves, including Twitter.  I think new, non-techy visitors to Twitter are confused by what it does in some ways. Twitter's interface and presentation play a large role in that.<p>Twitter feels less personal than Facebook. The 73x73 image is tiny compared to Facebook's profile image, and there's little info on the page about real social connections. You are limited to one type of content, tiny text messages. It <i>seems</i> like a social site, but doesn't feel very connected. It seems to me Twitter is a mess of missed opportunities and muddled focus right now. They've tried to push it as a way to keep up with celebrities... Apple's iTunes 'ping' hasn't worked out with that whole Pro>Consumer set up.<p>I think Twitter's strength is in being a messaging system. People could use it to replace SMS, free, with a better interface - or does it have a better interface? Twitter's DM capabilities leave a bit to be desired. The web interface is rather feature-free, and aren't they cutting off API/OAuth access to DMs soon or something?  Anyhow, look what the NYT did with Twitter's service recently - that is the sort of building on Twitter I see occurring, but I'm not even sure if Twitter themselves understand the potential for Twitter to become infrastructure, not just a way for people broadcast how much you hate traffic or like a sandwich.",1308245317

First of all,  they keep repeating the words Plutonium and Uranium (particularly ""enriched Uranium"") and try to suggest that these are the major threats from the accident.<p>They're not.<p>Uranium isotopes have a half-life of billions of years,  so whatever radioactivity they emit is spread out over a very long time.  Overall,  uranium is toxic in the same way that lead is toxic,  and the chemical toxicity is probably worse than the radiotoxicity.  Even in a completely melted reactor core,  uranium dioxide is relativly stable and won't be quickly transported into the environment.<p>The isotopes of concern are primarily of Iodine and Cesium.  Radioiodine from the accident has almost completely decayed,  although Cesium isotopes may still be hazardous in heavily contaminated areas for years.<p>Currently there seem to be ""hotspots"" at considerable distances from the plant where doses on the ground are in a range that's at the edge of what nuclear power workers are permitted to get (but rarely do.)  There's no proof that radiation at that level is harmful,  but no proof that it's completely safe to have that exposure for your lifetime either.<p>Now,  it's also BS to say that the threat from spent nuclear fuel that's been sitting around for 10 years is as high as the threat from an active core or one that's been sitting around for three months -- it just isn't;  radioactivity decays and heat generation goes down,  so it's really unfair to count the number of ""cores"" worth of danger here.<p>That said,  I wouldn't blame people for mistrusting Japanese government,  industry and even society.  Japan has been the world's leader in nuclear accidents for the past 20 years, and it's often said that they're not completely honest about industrial accidents in general (such as in the auto industry.)<p>Nuclear safety requires a person who's disciplined and (for the most part) follows orders but who also has a strong individual sense of right and wrong and won't follow a bad order.  America's nuclear navy works hard to cultivate this ethos,  but I'm not sure if it's easy to cultivate this in Japan.",1308243680

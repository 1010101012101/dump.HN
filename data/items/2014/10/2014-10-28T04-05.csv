The average consumer doesn&#x27;t care about Firefox&#x27;s data storage policies or how much they cooperate with the government. They care that things just work and are fast enough. For me, the convenience of Google Chrome comes from the fact that it is tightly integrated with all of Google services. I can use one Google account to log into my browser, access my email, set up a calendar, etc. Sure, Firefox can do syncing too, I just prefer using one company that does it all rather than two that do half.<p>Also, unrelated, I think Firefox spent too long copying Google Chrome&#x27;s interface and now they are playing catch up.<p>Regardless, Firefox usage continues to decline month after month.

Twitter beat Facebook long ago at this race, Snapchat also competes, but YikYak sees new content faster than I can pull to refresh.<p>People say that Facebook would survive against Twitter because it&#x27;s such a different service (e.g. people are not capable of saying what they want to say in just 140 characters). However, In my experience, people are capable of adapting. People are quick to try new things. People go where their friends go and when a service loses it&#x27;s shine and and starts doing things that are un-cool, people move on.<p>Twitter is one of the few big websites and apps I use regularly which I can honestly say the design and UX has gotten far worse over the years.<p>Search on Twitter has always been a horrible struggle.

If you do away with collapse, you are left with a many-worlds type interpretation, in which the wave function simply evolves unitarily forever.  It is in this sense that the current state &quot;dictates&quot; the previous states---the histories consistent with one measurement or another separated based on the kind of measurement made.  If you do the interference experiment, the histories consistent with outcomes of that experiment are ones in which the photon takes no definite path.  If you do the path-determining experiment, you no longer get interference patterns but also the consistent histories are ones in which the photon takes a definite path---either one slit or the other.<p>Since you get to decide which kind of experiment to do <i>after</i> the photon passes the slitted screen, your decision seems to force the histories to become either the interference kind or the definite-path kind <i>after</i> you might expect that to have already been determined.  <i>That</i>&#x27;s the sense in which the future seems to control the past.<p>I agree that this was not explained clearly in the article.

Look at them if you want to know something about the performance of C++ code transpiled to run in a browser, which is an interesting thing to know. And it&#x27;s getting to be more and more relevant these days. (Even &quot;real-world JS&quot; is going to start using asm.js libraries, I bet.)<p>But asm.js execution <i>is</i> very different from JS execution, even in browsers that don&#x27;t have specialized asm.js paths. Executing regular JS is all about balancing compile time and garbage collection with code execution. asm.js barely uses GC, and allows lots of opportunities to cache compilation in ways that would be invalid for regular JS. So the whole space of tradeoffs is different.",1414469124

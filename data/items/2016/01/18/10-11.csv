10923688,comment,10923379,10923379,0,0,jbk,,,"With VideoLAN, we&#x27;re not on github, but I believe we fit the &#x27;large open source project&#x27; description. We host VLC, FFmpeg, x264 and quite a few related libraries.<p>For VLC and all related VideoLAN projects, we&#x27;re moving to our own instance of GitLab hosted on our infrastructure.<p>And to be honest, it&#x27;s quite good, but a few stuffs are ridiculously limited, to the point that some people in the community are resisting the change.<p>The first part is the groups and subgroups: it seems incredibly difficult to give sub-groups access to repos (like a team for iOS, one for Android, one for libVLC... but all are under the &quot;videolan/&quot; group). It seems there is a way with the EE, but not in the CE; and the current idea for the CE is to have sub-projects, which is not good, because it will make our URLs way more complex than needed.<p>The second part is the bugtracker/issues tracker. We use trac for VLC, and we want to leave it for something better; but gitlab issues is way too limited, even when using the templates. Especially, it seems to be impossible to add custom searchable fields (like &quot;platforms&quot;, &quot;priority&quot; or &quot;modules&quot;) which are very very useful to do queries. Also, there is no way to do custom queries and store them (&quot;I want all the bugs for Windows, which are related to the interface modules&quot;).<p>If I remember correctly, this second part was also a complaint in the open letter to github.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not really related, since it&#x27;s more a feature request, but we&#x27;d love to allow external people to fork our repos, but not create completely new ones (or have them validated) because we don&#x27;t want to host any projects under the sun (there is github and gitlab for that). So far, you either allow both features or none of them.<p>PS: can we have custom landing pages and custom logo in the CE version? :D :D",1453114637

If you want to write really high-performance Java or C# code, you have to make it allocation free on hot paths, you have to be <i>very careful</i> with what types are on the stack and which are on the heap, and you have to pay a lot of attention to data layout (In java that doesn&#x27;t have structs especially, making lots and lots of types as SoA instead of collection of objects for example).<p>The bottom line is: while you can make C# and Java code run really fast, it&#x27;s very hard and non-idiomatic C# and Java code you end up with. It&#x27;s so hard, that it&#x27;s actually no easier than writing e.g. Rust or C++ code to do the same thing!

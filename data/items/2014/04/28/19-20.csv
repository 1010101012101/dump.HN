The most common objection is the lack of generics, which make it tricky to write reusable container libraries.<p>Golang comes pretty close to flat-out rejecting object orientation. It&#x27;s only barely more object-friendly than C is. If you&#x27;re the kind of programmer that wants to model a problem domain or build code with the Smalltalky feel that Gang of Four patterns give Java and C++, you will also hate Golang.<p>Generics might happen in the future (the more Golang I write, the less excited I am at the prospect), but a richer object model seems very unlikely. If you want to hang your argument on polymorphism rather than generics (I applied the principle of charity and assumed that&#x27;s what you meant), the argument gets less valid, not more.",1398715134

The fact that there really is not one piece of evidence she&#x27;s been able to produce leads me to believe that claims of sexual misconduct are anything more than imagined.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a situation where I was reasonably certain that I observed fiduciary misconduct. At the time I basically had three choices:<p>(1) stay at the company and ignore it\n(2) stay at the company and collect irrefutable evidence and expose the wrongdoing; or\n(3) ignore it and leave the company because it was not my problem to deal with and would be more damaging to my career to do something about it.<p>There was never a 4th option: &quot;expose the wrongdoing with no concrete evidence&quot;. I didn&#x27;t have enough to substantiate any allegations. It&#x27;s entirely possible that I could have even been mistaken about what actually happened since my relationship with the person in question was rocky and I might have been projecting my negative perceptions of that person onto a novel situation. Without collecting concrete evidence to prove my allegations, I couldn&#x27;t even be certain of what happened, much less certain that exposing the wrongdoing without evidence would be fruitful.<p>The burden of proof was the responsibility of the accuser, and in this instance the accuser has failed to substantiate claims made.",1398715132

So the concept of only doing manual error handling was new to me, but after a few months of golang I love it now and exceptions in python started to really annoy me.<p>In Go, I&#x27;m forced to do error handling right after every single call that will possibly return an error. While I thought that the resulting code looked ugly and repetitive, the result is a much more focused and intelligent error handling.<p>If i wanted the same granularity and robustness of error handling in python, I&#x27;d have to put a catch all try..except block around every single call .<p>Exceptions are a good time saver in stateless request based programs (like HTTP/web stuff) where it&#x27;s sort of accetable if one request fails. I could just not care so much about detailed error handling, the worst that could happen is that i don&#x27;t catch some error and the wsgi wrapper will catch it and return error 500 to the client. \nBut building daemons in python is just plain painful.

There&#x27;s no mystery about what causes motor vehicle collisions.  Here is a huge report from the administration to Congress on the causes of motor vehicle collisions.<p><a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811059.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811059.PDF</a><p>The majority of crashes occur in daytime, in clear weather, while the car is moving in a straight line.  You&#x27;ll note that substantially all of these causes would be solved by a computer-driven car.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nAbout 41 percent of the driver-related critical reasons were recognition errors that include inattention, \ninternal and external distractions, inadequate surveillance, etc. Of these, the most frequently \noccurring critical reason was inadequate surveillance that refers to a situation in which a driver failed \nto look, or looked but did not see, when it was essential to safely complete a vehicle maneuver. This \ncritical reason was assigned to drivers in about 20 percent of crashes. Internal distraction as a critical \nreason was assigned to drivers in about 11 percent of the crashes. \nAbout 34 percent of the driver-related critical reasons were decision errors that included too fast for \nconditions (8.4%), too fast for curve (4.9%), false assumption of others’ actions (4.5%), illegal \nmaneuver (3.8%), and misjudgment of gap or others’ speed (3.2%). In about 10 percent of the \ncrashes, the critical reason was a performance error, such as overcompensation (4.9%), poor \ndirectional control (4.7%), etc. \nAmong the nonperformance errors assigned as critical reasons to drivers in about 7 percent of the \ncrashes, sleep was the most common critical reason (3.2%). The effectiveness of vehicle-based \ncountermeasures used in mitigating the effects of various driver performance, recognition, and \ndecision errors could be evaluated using this information.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>You&#x27;ll note that &quot;vehicle problem&quot; is the critical pre-crash event for only 1.2% of crashes.  Therefore if the computer _only_ solves the sleeping driver problem, and even if it is twice as bad as humans at handling vehicle mechanical failure, society is still reaping a net benefit.  But, of course, computer-driven cars can solve nearly all of these causes of crashes: inattention, misperception, distraction, sleeping, driving too fast for conditions, and on and on.",1398714946

7662508,comment,7661608,7661608,4,0,gmisra,,,"What&#x27;s interesting to me is that &quot;last mile logistics&quot; is essentially a commodity business. But there are two very common trends in the space that don&#x27;t quite make sense to me:<p>1. Treating delivery drivers as &quot;independent contractors&quot;. This seems to be a very common approach, with all kinds of plausible motivations (limiting liability, making variable demand handling easier, being able to call your service a &quot;platform&quot;, keeping headcount cosmetics appealing for parent VCs, etc). Historically, delivery driving is a usually regulated and often unionized industry, so I wonder if this approach will scale. There are also often distortionary impact of these contractors on overall regulated wage industries (hint: your postmate probably does not make a living wage for the time spent being a postmate). Viewed from the lens of potential acquirers, if your &quot;efficiencies&quot; are based around not paying drivers in the same way they have been historically paid, that is not something I need to acquire.<p>2. User acquisition seems to be at a premium - quite a few of the delivery-on-demand businesses in San Francisco have been running generous new user and user referral discounts recently. It makes sense if their goal is to increase user rolls, but I find that most of these services have limited, if any, lock-in effects [a]. Obviously, in order to innovate on delivery-at-scale, companies must first achieve sufficient scale to be able to prove out new ideas. But, from my peanut gallery seat, the user acquisition strategies appear to be driven more by the &quot;acquire users first and monetize later&quot; strategy that happens when many similar VC companies are competing for the same users. Amazon/Google/etc don&#x27;t tend to get excited about acquiring you for your user base, unless you can demonstrate high brand value or user loyalty, which seems particularly challenging in this industry.<p>So, my $0.02 is simply that platformization followed by paid user acquisition seems to be the template for this industry, and yet it does not make sense to me.<p>[a] I have heard recently of a local, &quot;last mile&quot; food delivery start-up that is approaching it&#x27;s vendors with exclusive sales agreements.

Whenever it is necessary for the driver of a motor vehicle to cross a bicycle lane that is adjacent to his lane of travel to make a turn, the driver shall drive the motor vehicle into the bicycle lane prior to making the turn and shall make the turn pursuant to Section 22100 [general turning regulations]</i><p>The car must be <i>in</i> the bicycle lane before turning. You can not turn by crossing over the lane, and if you couldn&#x27;t get into the lane before, you will have to wait to get into the lane and then turn.<p>This figures in nicely with the people here saying we should disregard cyclists because they constantly break the traffic laws. Are <i>you</i> always in the bicycle lane when turning with your car? Don&#x27;t claim this is a <i>surprising</i> rule and <i>not generally known</i>; try cycling some time, you&#x27;ll find the traffic laws are setup in a way that often makes it impossible to travel efficiently, safe and <i>legally</i>.<p>(If I can just add this: traffic laws for cycling are the <i>ultimate bikeshed</i>. Imagine a bikeshed committee, where the people on the comittee have no need for a bikeshed and no concept of how people use a bikeshed, or why. In Germany, up until some time ago, they regulated the <i>voltage</i> and <i>energy source</i> for bike lights.)",1398714765

7662422,comment,7662013,7662013,1,0,crypt1d,,,"There is an interesting observation about Asian cultures made by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers [1]. He argues that one of the reasons why Asians are _statistically_ better at math than others is because of the language and cultural legacy. More precisely, it is a lot easier to remember numbers in Chinese (and other Asian languages, apparently) than in English, giving Chinese children a head start in mathematics. This turns into quite an advantage by the time they reach college. \nHe also argues that societies that were developed on rice farming tend to be more diligent as it is a lot more labor intensive work than ,for example, wheat farming. Also Chinese feudalism had more of a &quot;hands off&quot; approach, where the landlords were always taking a fixed amount of their earnings. So while Europeans were making pretty much the same amount of money during all their harvests, Asians had an income which was more proportional to their efforts.\nThere is a lot more to it for sure, and I don&#x27;t know if he is right, but its certainly a nice read.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://gladwell.com/outliers/rice-paddies-and-math-tests/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gladwell.com/outliers/rice-paddies-and-math-tests/</a>",1398714115

The languages used (say SystemC or Verilog) offer very little high-level abstraction, and the simulation tools suck. Sections of the CPU are still typically designed in isolation in an ad-hoc way, using barely any measurements, and rarely on anything more than a few small kernels. Excel is about the most statistically advanced tool used in this. Of course, CPUs are hugely intertwined and complicated beasts, and the optimal values of parameters such as register file sizes, number of reservation stations, cache latency, decode width, whatever, are all interconnected. As long as design teams only focus on their one little portion of the chip, without any overarching goal of global optimization, we&#x27;re leaving a ton of performance on the table.<p>And for that matter, so is software/compiler design. The software people have just been treating hardware as a fixed target they have no control over, trusting that it will keep improving. That makes us lazy, and our software becomes more and more slow, by design (The Great Moore&#x27;s Law Compensator if you will, also known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law</a>).<p>The same problems we see in hardware design, huge numbers of deeply intertwined parameters, also applies to software/compiler design. We&#x27;re still writing in C++ for performance code, for chrissakes. And even beyond that, the parameters in software and hardware are deeply intertwined with each other. To optimize hardware parameters, you need to make lots of measurements of representative software workloads. But where do those come from, and how are they compiled? Compiler writers have the liberty to change the way code is compiled to optimize performance on a specific chip (even if this isn&#x27;t done so much in practice). To get an actually representative measurement of hardware, these compiler changes need to be taken into account. Ideally, you&#x27;d be able to tune parameters at all layers of the stack, and design software and hardware together as one entity. That is, make a hardware change, then do lots of compiler changes to optimize for that particular hardware instantiation. This needs to be automated, easy to extend, and super-duper fast, to try all of the zillions of possibilities we&#x27;re not touching at the moment. There&#x27;s even &quot;crazy&quot; possibilities like moving functionality across the hardware/software barrier. Of course it&#x27;s a difficult problem, but we&#x27;ve made almost zero progress on it.<p>Backwards compatibility is another reason. New instructions get added regularly, but those are only for cases where big gains are achieved in important workloads. For the most part, CPU designers want improvements that work without a recompile, because that&#x27;s what most businesses/consumers want. One can envision a software ecosystem that this wouldn&#x27;t be such a problem for, but instead we have people still running IE6/WinXP/etc. Software can move at a glacial pace, and hardware needs to accommodate it. But this of course also enables this awfully slow pace of software progress.",1398713963

The basic argument is that is computers keep getting more powerful in the way they have for the last century (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg</a>) then at some point they will have processing power greater than a human brain and assuming software development keeps up that they will be able to exhibit human level intelligence. The hardware getting up to human equivalent levels seems a near certainty and software development while less certain is coming along in a promising manner with Google&#x27;s self driving cars and the like.",1398713911

So, with your range of 0.1-0.2 miles, a human would have 5-10 seconds to perceive the problem and stop.<p>Google&#x27;s LIDAR can see approximately 60 meters out.  At 70mph, this gives the autonomous car under 2 seconds to perceive the problem and stop.<p>Most humans have a perception-reaction time of approximately 2.5-3.0 seconds on a highway, so the human range drops to 2-7 seconds.  Factor in the time it takes to apply a maneuver (move foot to break pedal, apply break) and it drops even further -- I&#x27;m not certain by how much -- likely another 1-2 seconds.  At your lower bound of 0.1 miles, I think the autonomous car already has the advantage.<p>I think it&#x27;s clear that a computer would react and apply a maneuver tremendously faster than a human.  I also think it&#x27;s obvious that to have a clear advantage over a human on a highway, these sensors need additional range.

My preferred definition of intelligence is broad. Intelligence is a system that has i/o & a feedback cycle. Thus, I think all matter & concepts have intelligence. Of course, there are higher forms of intelligence, such as human intelligence (which is not limited to the brain as we have a complete nervous system & more generally, autonomous cells).<p>I still think it&#x27;s magical, however. Even if we understand all of the rules & procedures, the experience of it all coming together fills me with awe. It&#x27;s like playing a game where you understand the rules, yet you can achieve zen & a higher consciousness when playing. Another example is Fractals. The driving equation is simple, yet infinite complexity & beauty is created.<p>> Reproducing intelligence is mostly a matter of finding the correct formula, the right structures, the right technology. After that it will be boring, ordinary, even disposable. This doesn&#x27;t sit well with some people who reject that on an emotional level even if they can&#x27;t figure out any concrete reason why.

The collaborative authority will prevent it anyway.<p>People don&#x27;t need much incentive to do stupid things.  There&#x27;s not much incentive to toss trash out a car window rather than into a bin, but people do that every day.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of mindless minor vandalism that happens on WP because of that.<p>Some parts of WP are really horrible.  Ignore all the obvious places (anything to do with Ireland or Northern Ireland; Israel and Palestine; Abortion; etc).  But quiet gnomic uncontroversial edits can get mired up.  Someone makes some good faith (and valid) changes to punctuation and spelling.  They are quickly reverted by an overzealous twinkle user on &quot;vandal patrol&quot; (wikipedia has done a lot to stop this problem and that needs to be recognised) who also leaves a warning template.  The newbie gnomic editor removes the template and reverts the article reversion, and is then receives multiple templates.  I don&#x27;t know how many people have a first experience of WP like that, or find it repeated if they try again, and it would be good to know.  But the point of mentioning this is that the toxic parts of WP are a strong incentive to some people to &quot;stick one over&quot; to the WP community.  Long term sleeper accounts making a variety of good edits with a few known bad edits; concern trolling; wiki-lawyering; etc.  There are plenty of meta-wikipedia places where very long threads can draw in many users to spend a long time talking about stuff which is, at its core, nonsense.<p>I suspect the future-people may find the meta stuff, especially comparing the meta stuff across different wikipedias, more interesting than actual WP.",1398712364

7662136,comment,7659524,7661947,3,0,Theodores,,,"Crumple zones and needing a &#x27;big car&#x27; is old fashioned safety.<p>Probably the best cars to study are the big brothers of the Smart Car - the Mercedes A and B series. The original A series had a problem with the elk test, that was fixed and is a side issue to the main safety advances.<p>The passenger cell is the key part, ideally you want the engine to go under it rather than land in the passengers laps. That is a key innovation for whether you can walk out afterwards.<p>Next is the steel the passenger cell is made of. It doesn&#x27;t crumple, things bounce off it.<p>Then the real big innovations for survival are inside the passenger cell. Those airbags, the way the seat belt tensions, the way the steering column collapses. These are big things.<p>There is a &#x27;Fifth Gear&#x27; episode on Youtube that you can watch to see how all of this works. They crash a big Volvo that happens to be a decade old and built when the crumple one was king into a modern Renault hatchback. In the hatchback the passenger compartment stays as is, all of the airbags go off, the crash test dummies walk off with not so much as a scratch. Even the doors open. Meanwhile, the Volvo is a scene of carnage. The firemen have to cut the crash test dummies out, leaving their amputated legs behind.<p>Personally I would want a full rally-car style roll cage inside whatever car I had if I had to have one, however, I gave up driving after crashing into an on-coming car :-) That was a turning point for me, I no longer derived pleasure from speed or sitting in traffic. I cycle now, or get the train. The accidents I am particularly keen to avoid are the rapid decelerations where, regardless of airbaggage, the brain crashes into the inside of one&#x27;s skull to result in the same sort of complications Shumaker is having now (wish him well). His incident was skiing, not driving, but the same principle applies.<p>Speaking of F1, I would like to see a Google car do the new Electric Formula E series, lapping every driver on the grid like some mad Scalextric car, taking the most optimal lines through the bends and learning the track to go quicker and quicker... In F1 would be cool too, like an automotive version of IBM&#x27;s chess playing adventures, taking on World Champions and just beating them hands down. That would be cool.",1398711652

That makes accessing information off-chip difficult in a single cycle, since 6 centimeters is on the same order as the linear scale of most motherboards.<p>This limit doesn&#x27;t immediately impact computations that are carried out entirely on-chip.  I expect that&#x27;s the great majority of computations on today&#x27;s CPUs, which typically have large caches.  So I&#x27;m not sure the GP&#x27;s explanation is correct, although it&#x27;s certainly interesting.",1398711613

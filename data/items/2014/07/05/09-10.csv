All that hate that MongoDB takes here on HN makes me reconsider technologies I am using.<p>I will not have many relations in my database (model User, model Document, User owns Document... and that&#x27;s all) so I thought that NoSQL databases will do. Plus, MongoDB lets me use GridFS - I&#x27;m planning to store pdf presentations in it.<p>If I should drop MongoDB, what other technology should I use? Or should I fall back to Postgres + ORM and manage my files in filesystem manually?<p>I don&#x27;t want to start a flame, I am looking for an advice. I have considered MongoDB to be &quot;good enough&quot; as GridFS lets me store my files without a hassle, but after all that I read on the Internet, now I am not so sure.",1404554318

7991471,comment,7990438,7990438,2,0,richbradshaw,,,"Retina Macbook Pro. You can run it at a variety of resolutions that all look very sharp - 1920 x 1200 is very usable, but you can bump it way up to stupid high resolutions if you want screen space.<p>I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s awesome because I can effectively go from web browsing on a 1440 x 900 laptop to working on the equivalent of an iMac (2560 x 1440) or even higher (2880 x 1800) without losing sharpness.<p>If you then want extra space, you can plugin in an external monitor, but to be honest, I ended up selling the two externals I used to use (they were 1080p, and seemed small and blurry in comparison).<p>Using OSX, you also get the benefits that it&#x27;s very unixy/linuxy, so you get bash, ssh, openssl, grep, sed, ruby, python, php, apache etc as part of the system. With Xcode you get other tools like git. Configuring an acceptable dev environment for web dev can be done without downloading anything extra. (Of course, to get an awesome dev environment does require a bit more work, but arguably much less than the equivalent on Windows).",1404553980

One of my little hates about Windows is how Microsoft are lazy at things such as icons. We have a mixture of new and old icons all through the system and it makes things look ugly.

7991464,comment,7991152,7991451,8,0,reikonomusha,,,"I agree.<p>Haskell enforces a programmer to create structure. There&#x27;s no way around it. And it&#x27;s (nearly) impossible to hack things together without failing early and often.<p>As a result, before the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve can be explored, you&#x27;re stuck making guesses on how the problem should even be structured. You spend a few hours with one guess, it turns out to not get your far, and you try another.<p>The unfortunate part is that these guesses aren&#x27;t letting you get to the meat of the problem effectively; you&#x27;re stuck trying to solve a <i>meta-problem</i>.<p>Of course, once you have solved the meta-problem well enough, you can start exploring your problem. Unfortunately, you may find that your meta-solution doesn&#x27;t actually let you answer questions you didn&#x27;t know you wanted to answer from the get-go, and now you&#x27;re back to square-one.<p>When everything is right, the program is usually very beautiful, safe, and—if you&#x27;re skilled enough—efficient.<p>Perhaps not all Haskell programmers have this issue for very non-trivial programs, though I certainly do.",1404553671

7991462,comment,7988738,7988970,2,0,Perseids,,,"Maybe you underestimate how many numbers are weeded out just by checking divisibility by 3, 4 and 5? The first check regarding 2 will always return true, as `val` is incremented by 2. The check for divisibility by 3 will cause an abort for two out of three calls. The check for divisibility by 4 will cause an abort of half of the remaining calls (as `val` is incremented). And I guess the check for 5 will weed out an additional segment of 4 out 5. Thus just after checking 3, 4 and 5 only 1/3 * 1/2 * 1/5 of the `val`s will continue down the recursion call. So the majority of calls terminate in the highly optimized static division code.<p>Now you can still argue that the remaining calls that go deep into the recursion could account for a lot of time. I don&#x27;t believe this is the case though, as in each recursion call you should terminate a constant fraction of each calls, so the drop down should be exponential.<p>An other interesting observation of this phenomenon is that running the recursion backwards (beginning with the large divisors) might greatly decrease the runtime as a more significant fraction of the `val`s are falsified by larger divisors in the first calls of the recursion.",1404553578

7991453,comment,7988478,7990597,0,0,pyre,,,"You seem to have misread what I posted. Let&#x27;s break down what I said:<p>> That said, I think that Assange&#x27;s publicity seems like it plays a part into why this is being pursued. There doesn&#x27;t even need to be nefarious pressure from the USA for that to be true.<p>(I&#x27;m not heavily invested in the Assange situation, and I don&#x27;t spend hours pouring over all publicly available material on the matter, so forgive me if I&#x27;m missing something obvious here.)<p>I said this because it seemed like a few things could be true:<p>1. The woman could have come forward due to the extra publicity that Assange was getting at the time [ If I remember correctly, this happened around the time the Wikileaks was publishing the leaked diplomatic communications. ] Note, that this says <i>nothing</i> about whether or not he actually raped her, nor does it say anything about whether or not he should stand trial for said rape.<p>2. The Swedish government could have been pursuing the case extra hard because he was a public figure. [ Maybe I&#x27;m cynical, but I feel like authorities may not pursue a case that hard after the suspect has fled the country. Especially if it&#x27;s &quot;only rape&quot; rather than something sexy like &quot;terrorism&quot; that will get them a promotion. ]<p>3. The publicity surrounding Assange makes him easier to find abroad, unlike someone with less of a profile, who might be more difficult to find for extradition.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t even have to be at the government level. Maybe he did rape her, but she only came forward after seeing him in the media. This would still be his publicity playing into it. Also, his publicity make it easy for Swedish authorities to know where he is to pursue him.<p>In response to @notahacker saying:<p>> think Sweden has a general policy of pursuing alleged rapists even when they aren&#x27;t public figures.<p>This plays back to those original 3 points.<p>How does any of this make me a mysogynist? At no point do I express an opinion on:<p>- The veracity of the woman&#x27;s claims<p>- If Assange should go to Sweden to sort out this issue / stand trial.<p>Just because a woman doesn&#x27;t come forward right away does not prove that she was not raped, nor does it prove that she has some nefarious purpose.",1404553010
7991451,comment,7991152,7991152,10,0,orangeduck,,,"I think this demonstraights a real weakness of Haskell. Several times I&#x27;ve started a new project only to spend several hours trying to work out the correct way to structure what I want. Often it is hours before I even get my first successful compile. This is exactly as shown in this blog post. While some people enjoy this kind of tinkering, for me this really quickly saps all my motivation for the task. I just want to get something, anything, working. I work best jumping directly into a task and understanding it from the inside out, learning from my mistakes. Sometimes if I do find a quick and dirty way to get something working in Haskell - often refactoring it also becomes pretty difficult - which turns me off again. Neither of these are problems I have in other languages.<p>Arguments for which approach is better aside, it is no wonder lots of people who learn and approach tasks like me, feel a little betrayed by Haskell. I&#x27;ve used it for a bunch of things, I&#x27;m past the steep learning curve - but it seems I&#x27;m still not reaping the rewards. Is my philosophy of jumping into projects really so bad? Is it Haskell&#x27;s place to question such an approach, when it has served me so well elsewhere?",1404552914
7991450,comment,7989490,7990465,1,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"If I&#x27;m being fair, audio encoders are more advanced than video encoders, and we can probably shave more off with psychoacoustics than we can with our current understanding of psychovisuals. On the other end of the scale, video encoders have to process orders of magnitude more data, in more dimensions!<p>For example, Opus&#x27;s CELT encoder uses lapped transforms and keeps about the same level of constrained-energy. Combined with the (hybrid) voice codec in some very advanced ways, it makes for the most advanced audio codec around by quite some margin.<p>You look at video, and nothing&#x27;s that good yet, not even HEVC.

7991415,comment,7986612,7987806,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Good points. I think that responsive design is probably one of the biggest use cases for CSS layouts these days, though I don&#x27;t know that it was a driving force or even a consideration when The Great Tableless War began. In any case, I&#x27;m not quite a believer in responsive design either. The short is that, as commonly practiced, responsive design fails to acknowledge the relationship between content and layout. I posted a lengthy comment on this thread with more on that, so I&#x27;ll spare HN&#x27;s bandwidth the duplication.<p>Image slicing was indeed nasty and I don&#x27;t think it was as much a function of table-based layout as an implementation choice. Some tools were particularly nasty with this, but they were less famously also capable of outputting equally nasty CSS/div based code. So, good handcoding is really required to achieve any semblance of maintainable design, whether CSS or table-based.<p>But, I think you nailed the history. And, it just happened that table capabilities were remarkably useful for laying out a page. Had this been intentional vs a byproduct of that tag&#x27;s function, the outcome may have been different. One could literally rename &quot;table&quot; to &quot;grid&quot;, &quot;tr&quot; to &quot;row&quot;, and &quot;td&quot; to &quot;col&quot; and be most of the way there. Would a separate tag of this ilk that could be additionally styled with CSS have silenced the tableless zealots? We may never know. But, if so, it&#x27;s amazing to think that all of this upheaval, pain, and lost hours was the result of such simple puritanical ideology.<p>Such an HTML tag vs. pure CSS construct would have also pointed to the already blurred lines between HTML&#x27;s suggested role as merely a data container vs. its unavoidable role in presentation. The theory that HTML represents only data still manages to sell itself when we are talking say, paragraph and list elements. This is so, in spite of the fact that, like &quot;real&quot; tables, even those elements are themselves completely loaded with implicit layout information.<p>We need to embrace the fact that a paragraph tag implies that this element will need to be offset and, yes, the details can be found in the CSS. But, when reading/writing the code, the order and structure are intuitive. We don&#x27;t randomly spit out a group of paragraphs, then impose the ordering via a stylesheet. Instead, we expect the order to be as it exists in the document. Same with lists and other elements. Likewise, the fact that the structure of the document has implications on its layout even leaks through when using CSS. For instance, assigning a value of absolute to the position attribute of an element, positions it relative to its ancestor in the document structure.<p>But, it&#x27;s when &quot;pure&quot; layout is involved that things become murkier. We suddenly want to disavow that the natural layout clues are already there and instead force this unnatural separation into CSS. The problem is that much like with tabular data or a series of paragraphs, all content on a page has a relationship to other content that is best expressed in a natural grid like structure. It&#x27;s not just visual, but actually semantic. So, it is natural to express this relationship in the markup and leave the styling details to CSS. Perhaps more importantly, it is unnatural to spit a bunch of related content into a document in a completely unstructured fashion, then impose structure in a separate document.<p>So, let&#x27;s not repeat the ideological mistakes of the last Great War. Ask your Congressperson to keep the grid element out of CSS (except for styling) and add it to HTML where it belongs! :)",1404551684

You always care, <i>to some degree</i>. If I write a one time, 100-LOC script to process a 1GB of data, I don&#x27;t care if it takes 1 second or 1 hour. But I would care if it took 1 week or 1 month. That&#x27;s why Java performance is good enough for 99% of programs I write, Python is also good for many, but if I completely didn&#x27;t care for performance and wrote sloppy code in Python (or Java) I&#x27;d get into 10000x performance penalty region and this would be unacceptable in almost all cases.<p>&quot;I think x3-5 is a reasonable rough number to put on it but while I can point to benchmarks I can&#x27;t point to a comprehensive study that shows &quot;reasonably&quot; written across different domains&quot; YMMV. The micro-benchmarks in Great Language shootout disagree with this. Most of them are within 2x range and the one outstanding is actually a benchmark of particular regular expression engine. Ok, we should not believe microbenchmarks, so what about real, optimized applications? Compare performance of Netty vs nginx. Or Tomcat vs Apache. This is a tie. Or Hypertable vs HBase (yeah, despite huge expectations and marketing, even in Hypertable own benchmarks, Hbase comes only... 50% - 2x slower). Or Jake vs Quake2 with Jake2 again not even 50% worse (actually better in some cases).<p>&quot;C++ is the dominant language in Google Code Jam&quot;\nThis only supports what I already wrote - when writing a very small piece of code you have full control over, like for a competition, it is much easier to achieve high performance code in asm/C/C++ than in Java/C#/Scala etc. In a competitiona like that, even a 20% overhead is not acceptable and I&#x27;d also use C or C++. But you can&#x27;t extrapolate that on large-scale programming, where benefits of using a high level language matter much more.<p>&quot;Another thing to consider is that in a native language you can drop to assembler to optimize performance critical sections&quot; I can do that in Java or C# as well.",1404551617

Intel's current business model does not benefit from specialization or customization.  Intel needs to make a large profit on each CPU sold.  Intel drove out of the market anyone who could build a chipset since it interfered with volume and profits.  Intel would be happiest with their current business model if they built one laptop motherboard, one server motherboard, and one desktop motherboard.<p>This is a strategy built for the PC market.  It does not have anything to do with the current mobile market (non-laptop).<p>Samsung and Apple want to build the best end product.  They want to put things in and leave things out.  They cannot do that with Intel, but can do that with ARM.  Intel doesn't allow or want customized SoC.  Apple and Samsung do.  Other vendors also make their own SoC from ARM cores.  These SoCs provide different benefits.  Having a common instruction set allows switching to another SoC when needed.",1356195455

However, if somebody sues you as a sole proprietorship, you just show up in court with no money out of your pocket.

4956892,comment,4956625,4956747,16,0,polyfractal,,,"One of my hobbies is FPV flying with RC planes and quads, so I can comment on ""consumer grade"" drones.<p>The ARDrone is completely a toy.  It has a range of about 20m before the video cuts out and the quad flies away by itself, crashing into a building or just falling out of the sky.<p>That said, you can make a long distance plane complete with video, gps and autopilot for $1000 - $2000.  Depending on setup, flight time is between 15 minutes and an hour, with effective ranges up to 20km.<p>HOWEVER, very few people are capable of pulling off long distance FPV.  Hell, most people fail at short distance FPV.  The gear is hard, radio interference is a huge bitch (especially if you are near any urban area) and frankly, it's hard to fly a little plane made out of foam.  They get knocked around by wind gusts really easily.<p>Any rotor platform (tris, quads, etc) are limited in range to 1-2km max, simply because you can't strap enough batteries onto the thing for longer range.  Flight times are 15-30 minutes with current technology<p>Obviously, technology is going to continue to advance.  And if the project is bankrolled by a government, all bets are off.  But lone terrorists are going to have a hard time pulling off a drone attack.  You can simply triangulate their signal (both the radio control and the video feed, which also usually includes a GPS downlink) and know exactly where they are transmitting from.  Interfering with a drone is as simple as jamming the radio spectrum they are using...most drones (planes or quads) have about 10seconds before they crash into the ground when uncontrolled.<p>Lastly, carrying gear is really hard for any rotor platform.  Max payload right now is a couple of kilos, usually a DSLR on a gimbal.  These have to be lifted by octocopter setups (8 rotors) which absolutely kills battery efficiency.  You get 15 minutes flighttime max, and the thing sounds like a swarm of killer bees.",1356195054

For starters, there's probably a very short list of people who own tacocopters, let alone people who own grenades.<p>If it becomes a problem, I can think of countermeasures -- register the things, ban them in public spaces/require flight plans, detect and triangulate the control signal.  Heck, you could just look around; with a low tech system like that, whoever's flying the thing needs line of sight to it in order to identify the target.  It's noisy and slow and I'd expect not nearly as effective as stealing a car and doing a drive-by shooting.<p>But more than that, I'd be very surprised if that sort of thing becomes a problem.

4956841,comment,4954905,4955258,1,0,Too,,,"That's interesting, because in WarCraft 3, by Blizzard, randomness is designed to be ""fair"". They use a special word for it but i can't remember it at the moment.<p>For example, there are certain items that can give you a chance to blow a <i>""critical hit""</i>, a critical hit multiplies your damage with X.<p>Say an item gives you 30% chance to do 2X damage. However, the randomness has memory and is designed to distribute the critical hits evenly by gradually increasing the probability for every non critical hit and resetting it for every critical hit. So the first time you hit the chance isn't actually 30% but more like 10%. If you miss 3 times the chance of the fourth hit being a critical is more like 40-50%. The hit after that will be back on 10% probability. (Just picking numbers out of the blue to illustrate the concept, I'm sure there's some more thought through math behind it)<p>As the nr of hits goes towards infinity, 30% of them will still be critical but the chance of getting streaks of non-critical or streaks of critical hits is very low.<p>In practice it works very well from my experience. It is however not completely exploit-proof, you could for example go and increase your probability of initially blowing a critical hit by first making a few hits on NPCs and then go to battle against a harder enemy. But that's more of a hypothetical exploit as the time and risk of doing this simply isn't worth those few extra percent.",1356193580

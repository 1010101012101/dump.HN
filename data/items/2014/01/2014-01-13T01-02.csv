There is no morality in chinese business world, people will cheat their own family members to make some quick money, literally cheat their brothers, cousins etc. Insider trading is rampant, especially pump and dump schemes. There is virtually no regulation for insider trading and the few regulators that exist are easily paid off to turn a blind eye to what is going on.

7048420,comment,7046193,7046193,11,0,edmondlau,,,"The Economist article actually conflates two happiness metrics, happiness as measured by emotional well-being and happiness as measured by life evaluation.  Money buys happiness as measured by emotional well-being up to a point (that point being $75K for US residents), but higher income continues to increase life evaluation.<p>More details can be found in Daniel Kahneman&#x27;s 2010 study, &quot;High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being&quot;(<a href""http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.ful"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full</a>), where he uses the results of 450,000 Gallup poll responses to analyze the effects of income on both happiness metrics.<p>Kahneman defines emotional well-being as &quot;the emotional quality of an individual&#x27;s everyday experience—the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one&#x27;s life pleasant or unpleasant.&quot;  Life evaluation, on the other hand, refers to the thoughts that people have about their life when they think about it.&quot;<p>In the study, emotional well-being is captured via series of yes/no questions of the form &quot;Did you experience a lot of stress yesterday?&quot; or &quot;Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?&quot;  The goal is to assess their emotional well-being on the previous day.  Life evaluation is measured by asking respondents to rate their lives on a ladder scale from 0-10, where 0 is “the worst possible life for you” and 10 is “the best possible life for you.”<p>The data showed that for individuals earning below $75K, logarithmic increases in income (i.e. doubling one&#x27;s income) positively correlate with scores for happiness, enjoyment, and smiling and negatively correlate with scores for sadness, worry, and stress.  At $75K, you have enough to pay life&#x27;s bills and still have discretionary money to go out and spend time with friends.  The effects of income on emotional measures saturate at $75K because money no longer becomes the limiting resource for achieving more happiness, even though life satisfaction continues to rise when plotted against log income. &quot;We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being,&quot; Kahneman writes.",1389578287

If this means taking the ES* syntax wholesale, that&#x27;s fine. If it means minting a new (and hopefully, but arguably, nicer) syntax, that&#x27;s fine too. And if it means breaking backwards compatibility, that&#x27;s also alright, as the compiled lowest-common-denominator JS output will still be perfectly compatible with the new stuff.",1389578057
7048404,comment,7048116,7048128,1,0,fat0wl,,,"just want to drop another vote against against significant whitespace...<p>i find it slows down my coding because rather than coding & then quickly tidying i instead have to obsess over this tidying at every step or the code won&#x27;t work in the first place. I find it more efficient to do the code grouping as a &quot;post-POC&quot; task (or when things are starting to look confusing) and to leave the visual look to my discretion. I feel like whitespace languages are kindof subliminally forcing you toward 1 code style. There are some complex functions that look better to me certain ways -- specifically in cases where a group of commands are essentially executing one simple function. Once they work they can be forgotten & the programmer can de-emphasize them in some way according to taste<p>anyway, I am not a CoffeeScript guy. I&#x27;ve been avoiding it and waiting for Dart or something like that to take hold, since I&#x27;d like to see some serious language benefits if I&#x27;m going to have to introduce a compilation step. It&#x27;s one of those things I remain slightly bitter about because some shops judge you for not being into it (as well as Sass, Haml) even though they offer negligible benefits for many projects. That said, I can imagine cases where CoffeeScript <i>would</i> offer significant benefits (they are right there in the tutorials) but I haven&#x27;t really found those types of situations too much in the wild (tons of array math etc.), and if so they can often be simplified via jQuery or the like anyway.<p>So yea if it works for you, great, but I am glad whitespace syntax is not de-facto in the js world. I think js should remain as Java is -- other languages can be built on top of it with their own syntax types but developers still have the choice to ignore these supposed advancements & cherry-pick the ones they like (in my case progress in pure js + Dart will be where i focus my learning).",1389578050
7048403,story,,,5,5,dzink,"Ask HN: Would you reach out to the competition?",,"Pardon the deliberately vague post. This is about two teams with very complementary skills that are tackling the same problem and are at a very early stage. One team knows about the other and is considering whether and how to approach them for a possible team merge.<p>We are working on a product that takes a lot of passion to put to market because there isn&#x27;t a successful precedent out there that it will work. It takes a lot of attempts at translating real world processes to the web but it will remove a tremendous amount of friction and add a ton of value if we get it right. Others have done tangential products and failed in the past, so no slam dunk by any means. I&#x27;ve recently discovered another team that is seemingly trying to solve the same problem. I think they are approaching things wrong from a strategy standpoint, but they may eventually learn better. Both of our teams are at a really early stage. Both teams have worked on the idea for more than a year and both of us are in Beta. They are in private, we less so. I think my team has a better brand, better traction, and a product-market fit somewhat established already because of that. The interesting part is that if combined, our teams have perfectly complementary skills and we are about to be living within an hour of each-other. The other team has also slowed down their promotions for some reason and is either redoing their product or giving up soon. So I started wondering: Should we combine efforts to solve this massive problem? Should I reach out to them? How would you do that? Would you even do it? It would be a very risky proposition and it would be a difficult conversation, because any information exchanged could be used against either of us. At the same time, I think if combined the joint team (of three founders) would be unstoppable. What would you do? How would you protect both teams?<p>P.S.(Please, don&#x27;t seek out the other team.)",1389578034

But 99% of the time, you really mean:<p><pre><code>    if foo\n        bar()\n</code></pre>\nIn Python, the former is a syntax error and there is an explicit pass call to demonstrate that the block is empty.

We supported transactional object stores on NOR flash, which allowed random reads at full bus speed, and random writes as long as you were programming zeros. You could erase whole blocks back to all 1s, of course.<p>One of the things I had to model was the failure mode of the device. It was simple, I assumed:<p>- Stuck bits (at 1 or 0) would cause either a data write failure, or a failed attempt to write to a tracking structure. Both recoverable by using other storage.<p>- Failure to erase would result in a bad block.<p>- Writes to other memory wouldn&#x27;t cause disturbance to already committed writes<p>- ... a few other things as well.<p>NOR makes it easy, I guess. For the time, and for the quality of flash, it worked pretty well.

7048224,comment,7047394,7048146,5,0,bertil,,,"> we have time to prepare for the inevitable changes.<p>I would argue, having lived in countries that lead automation rates, that we already are at a point were large groups of the population cannot find work with their qualification, and never will: farmers, miners and forest workers had to convert to become factory workers, but most of those are now outsourced or automated; at the moment, there isn’t a job in Western countries for someone who has difficulty learning how to read.<p>Some people genuinely can’t grasp any abstract concepts: I taught in jail for a while, to people who couldn’t for the life of them generalise “Two apples plus three apples equals five apples; two sheets of paper plus three…” and remained baffled by ‘addition’ as an abstraction. Keep in mind: some of those guys fashioned working radios and distilleries from scratch.<p>Similarly, I have talked to taxi drivers who couldn’t understand it was in their interest to switch to Uber, how the trust mechanism worked with the app (they thought the dispatcher could better tell on the phone if the client was shifty), to say nothing of choosing a path based on a congestion map. I love my Roomba and my waching-maching, but without the cleaning jobs, what are immigrants to Western country going to do? Take care of elderly people to whom they can’t speak?<p>I fully agree with your point that automation is good for all, but we might have to face before the end of our careers a point where a vast majority of the population has to be considered handicapped, “mentally” for lack of a better word, out of the workforce and entirely subsidised.<p>At the moment, even a coder, hard working and of average skill, cannot find a job where I am: I know a handful of guys who can make functional, useful apps all by themselves (say: scanning barcode, interrogate database to tell if a product is ethical, handle  shopcart, and all that with a great design; sports tracking). They make a hundred of euros from those on the first month, but that’s it: I tell them to treat those as portfolios to get interviews, and they do. I have no idea what goes wrong during those, but their repeated failures to sign anything is bigger than one HR being in a bad mood.<p>What I see is a world in 15-20 years where 3% of the population designs things; 12% have menial jobs, mainly manning security and healthcare bot-based systems and 85% cannot work. Spain or even Berlin already have a modern economy with 30% unemployment: subsidies, black-market service jobs, low rents… it looks somewhat stable, if shocking.<p>Clay Shirky had an interesting point about that, in an essay called “Gin, TV series and Wikipedia” or something like that — where he assumed there is a sacrificed generation, and the next learns. I have a hard time seeing millenials be anything but creatives with a YouTube channel. Maybe that’s worth it.",1389574803

My iPad 3(30-pin connector) is still going strong for me, but I&#x27;m highly considering this when it&#x27;s released. The fact that it&#x27;ll run Windows 10 is definitely exciting too, though I wonder if it will get bogged down upon the arrival of Windows 10 as certain iOS devices have for certain iOS releases.

9296127,comment,9295696,9295816,0,0,tom_z,,,"Henrik_w, those are some good points. The potential of MOOCs to deliver low cost education has been hurt somewhat by poor design choices. Classes have been simply &quot;scaled up&quot; by professors without much change to their structure. Without physical classroom interactions, learning online is much more difficult and needs a a collaborative support community to aid that process.<p>A few friends of mine from high school and I build a company called StudyCloud that plays in the space. To solve the issue of lackluster collaboration and low retention, our product builds a social community for each individual course, having other students and teachers there for support and encouragement. These individual social communities are integrated together for the student into a complete course overview. This allows a student to keep track of all their classes, seeing easily how well they&#x27;re progressing at a moment&#x27;s notice. This at-a-glance functionality is coupled with extensive notifications that help bring students back to the platform regularly to engage with one another more frequently than might typically occur.<p>We&#x27;ve been working on StudyCloud for over a year now, with most of our growth in the Midwest. We are working with a few universities on hybrid course design to further improve not only the product but best practices for teachers.

In fact (having TAed a 400-student intro course once) I&#x27;m not even sure if assessment scales properly in  the larger brick and mortar classes. The professor was using an iClicker for pseudo-pop quizzes at the beginning of class but I noticed that a lot of students would simply give the same answers as their friends next to them. Likewise for the short essay questions in the final and midterm, they had created a massive Google Docs database combining lecture notes which (while on some level showing admirable initiative) also resulted in a number of identical (and, indeed, identically-wrong) answers.

9296088,comment,9295696,9295696,0,0,munin,,,"after running a few MOOC classes and contrasting them to brick and mortar classes the real problem in my opinion is assessment. the material we prepared was equal to what we would teach in a college class, but the assignment quality is not. this is I think a fundamental problem of scale. the only assessment tools that we have are multiple choice and regular expression matching short answer quiz questions. coming up with challenging yet fair multiple choice questions that let the learner express they have mastered a concept is extremely difficult. and to make the class rigorous, MOOC instructors would have to re-do that work for each class, which defeats another scaling point.<p>I think that MOOCs solved the wrong problem and because of that aren&#x27;t the solution to the class. the MOOC is an iteration on the textbook. a domain expert puts a lot of time into the layout, design and presentation of materials and then creates a relatively static asset out of it. it&#x27;s less static than the old textbook, but you can&#x27;t walk into the professors office and ask questions for an hour face to face either.<p>we haven&#x27;t figured out how to make assessment scale. we haven&#x27;t moved far from the model we used for thousands of years, which is to have a student stand and talk to their instructors/mentors, and their mentors to make a judgement. how can you get a deep sense of a students capabilities this way, online?<p>I don&#x27;t think it can&#x27;t be done, I just don&#x27;t think that MOOCs have really tried, and my current cynical understanding is that they don&#x27;t really want to try.

The management thought it was easier to keep me on than to hire again when the work increased, so I was there with nothing to do. My manager and everyone around me knew I had nothing to do, but I still found it quite stressful doing things like reading Slashdot while at work (it was a long time ago). In the end I started my own project using the work development tools so it looked like I was working as normal, but after a while that was also too much so I found another contract.<p>I do agree about extra stress in open plan workspaces. I&#x27;m the kind of person that can&#x27;t block out people around me like I notice some other people do, so everyone that walks past my desk I feel the need to glance up at them. In coffee shops I prefer the seating with my back to the wall. Music can be used to block out some of that distraction, but not all of it.",1427809242

If I start a MOOC and don&#x27;t finish, I have gained a little knowledge and lost nothing. College completion rates <i>are</i> a problem, because if I start college and don&#x27;t finish, I&#x27;m saddled with thousands of dollars in debt and no degree.

They could have sent an email and I would have an answer for them first thing in the morning. But they would rather call during off-hours, then wait until nearly the end of the next day to call back.<p>Then, they will say a bunch of stuff, nobody will write it down (except me, IFF I actually hear it).

So everyone will &quot;agree&quot; that it&#x27;s the direction we (meaning I) should go.

Most of those fans would probably really rather have that conversion ratio be extremely &quot;poor&quot; just because if it isn&#x27;t, then the game is pay to win, and absolutely not a single lick of us want the game to be pay to win. I bought a Constellation, which is kind of an in-universe equivalent to the Millenium Falcon. Since it&#x27;s a multi-crew ship, I would expect it to be about equivalent to when someone gets access to player housing in a MMO. If it takes a player who hasn&#x27;t dropped a dime more than the basic purchase fee of the game at launch much more than 15 to 20 hours of effort including setbacks to get into one of their own, I am going to be really, really worried about the long term prospects of the game.<p>2) Star Citizen has had the single most open development of any major title ever. Short of indie developers who live-stream the programming of their entire game, I don&#x27;t know anything that comes close. If nothing else comes out of it, we&#x27;ve all purchased some of the most interesting inside-baseball content on video game production ever.",1427808091

It&#x27;s complete hogwash. It doesn&#x27;t even stand up to the most basic of scrutiny. If it were true, how the hell did we ever get work done before the open office plan?<p>Suddenly transporting a failing team of globally located people into the same room together isn&#x27;t going to magically make them into an effective team. People don&#x27;t fail to communicate because they aren&#x27;t sitting next to each other. People fail at communicating because they are terrible communicators. PROTIP: if they actually write &quot;excellent communicator&quot; on their resume, then they are not.<p>Similarly, suddenly scattering a succeeding team across the planet isn&#x27;t going to make them fail. People who are good at communicating figure out how to communicate even under the worst conditions. Most of the developers on all of the big FOSS projects have never even heard each other&#x27;s voices!<p>But no, let&#x27;s treat people like cattle and make them hotbunk on workstations. If you have room to put up your own photos of your family at your desk, clearly you&#x27;re wasting company resources and your desk could be smaller.

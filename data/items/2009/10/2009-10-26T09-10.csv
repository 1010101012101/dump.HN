Sometimes, a story gets posted and few people are up to read/upvote it and it then gets buried by the constant influx of stories. My website gets lots of referrals from HN, mostly in California, but a lot also comes from NY and Europe through HN.<p>The dupe was not flagged because the URLs are different: the first one had a couple URL parameters (""?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss"") this one hasn't. HN could, conceivably, flag dupes by content, but that would require it to be more clever and I don't know how much free time to teach it this trick pg has.",1256550946

But, if your having trouble, I'd suggest create something much smaller, with just text fields for example, and try to build it up slowly.  Once you get used to it, you can create this interface.<p>3) Yeah, thats a good idea.  A ""same as last week"" button and a ""copy week"" button would be great.  This can only happen once you re-design the workflow though... I imagine it such that you click a ""add a new week"" button and then fill it in, so once you do that, you can have these buttons.<p>4) Yeah.  A warning if someone enters something thats not a number/integer, but a field is better (I prefer red text saying ""this should be a number"" that comes up next to the field, but thats up to you).<p>5) Even still.  If I put up a workout, who will be editing it?  How do I know they'll be editing it in a way thats really in the spirit of the original workout.  What if a professional weightlifter comes in and starts making the workout more hard core?  It might be ""better"" but not really good for a certain kind of audience?<p>This is not to say you can't find a way around this.  You may want to consider how people get ""access"" to a workout.  If you do restrict access though, a discussion page would be good.  I don't see this as an immediate issue, but something you should keep in the back of you mind and think about as you go forward.<p>6) :)  Its just the fact that your a ""computer person"" so an ""index"" is something you think about.<p>P.S. Its good that your taking all the feedback positively.",1256549627

902866,comment,902424,902424,0,0,teej,,,"I have a huge amount of respect for Mark Pincus.  He's really been through the trenches and has done a great job growing Zynga.  Mark followed two points of pg's advice in ""What Startups Are Really Like"" that set him up for success.  Here's what I've seen that have made Mark great.<p>In 2007, it was myself and Shervin Pishevar who set out to directly compete against Mark in the gaming space on Facebook.  We set our sights directly on Zynga - we used the absolutely best PR company and our huge stacks of VC cash to make sure that we were always one step ahead.  From the media's standpoint, it was a two-horse race with SGN taking a commanding lead over Zynga.  Mark, however, decided to ignore his competitors.  While we were too busy reading the headlines, he kept iterating on his core strategy.  He was spending every day polishing his secret sauce to make his games the largest and most profitable on Facebook.  Then Mafia Wars launched, ultimately validating his strategy.  The rest is history.<p>Mark certainly had plenty of opportunities to give up.  The app acquisition race was costly to all companies involved.  While bleeding that cash, Mark was constantly fighting to maintain the profitability of Poker in the midst of massive fraud.  Mark's dog, Zynga's namesake, also passed away in this time.  Despite all of this, he stayed persistent and stuck through to the end.<p>I've butted heads with Mark in the past on panels and in the news, but I can tell you without a doubt that Mark Pincus demands some serious respect for the company he's built and the work he's done to get there.",1256549301

I made up the term 'exercise group.'  It's to group the different sets and repetitions for one exercise.  I need to make the process more clear and easier to use.  This kind of ties in to the first problem.  I tried using javascript to have it all on one page in a dynamic fashion but wasn't able to piece it all together.

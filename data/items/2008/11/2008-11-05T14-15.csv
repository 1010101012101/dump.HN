Think about the experience of receiving a product from Apple and you see the value of packaging.<p>What is so interesting in this case is that it is a sign of how people's tastes are changing. These new, simple Amazon packages have more 'charm', not less. People are excited by the thought that they're being 'green'. The simple cardboard packaging speaks to the current love of simple, clean and even perhaps DIY design.  Simple is charming right now, and Amazon must be keenly aware that this is a smart move both for their bottom line as well as their customer satisfaction ratings.",1225897085

354495,comment,354096,354254,0,0,gopher,,,"Basically, Wordpress is written in PHP and this is the root of all evil.<p>Let's look at the roots of PHP: it was never designed as a programming language, it was a tiny script language used to create Rasmus Lerdorf's website. Thus, it has a lot of oddities like the === operaor.<p>Do you know why it it is there? Because they wrote a broken instr() wrapper and messed up the error handling. And instead of doing one thing right, they added another obfuscation layer. Great design.<p>Then, PHP was traditionally used by webdesigners, not programmers. This lead to tons of bad code and bad practices. It is not that you cannot write elegant code in PHP, but there is so much more bad code around that it is hard to find the good code.<p>So, why do wonder about this?",1225894355

Also, especially if you are doing CS-research: do an internship and ideally right now (I mean - find a good one, apply for, and get it; well, I know, there are not that many internships in winter time but some are certainly available).

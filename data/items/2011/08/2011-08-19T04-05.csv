The microcomputer was yours, and I think the pc was just a grown-up version of the microcomputer.<p>What is it that you are doing with your tablet that you can't/don't do with your laptop. They are more portable, but people clearly don't have a problem bringing their laptops to the coffee shop.<p>I don't deny that there is a place for tablets. It is a great form-factor. Much better for surfing the web while on the couch. But is that enough to make the 'post-pc' era? They serve the same people and for the most part the same function as a pc. Therefore, I see it still as just another form factor of a pc.<p>The people I know who have iPads (and one Xoom) surf the web with their tablets, maybe write the odd e-mail.<p>Is the shift to the 'post-pc' era anywhere near as world-changing as the web?<p>Can you elaborate on the 'how and what we can do with computing' that we couldn't do before?",1313729962

For example, Even though during atleast two days in a week I might have opportunity to go back early. I purposefully use the free time to check if I can do some extra work which will give an edge to my career.

I'm confused. How does the way that you store dates internally have anything to do with date parsing?

If there's not enough demand prices will have to increase. If the business model is broken for HP isn't it probably broken for Dell and the other big PC OEMs too.

In other words, they <i>should</i> be long. Your preparation, the quality of the content, and the selection of your subjects, are all excellent.<p>Pay for it?<p>I haven't decided yet, but probably. I think a lot of other people will as well. The key is to make the subscription help bridge the gap stated above. Busy people are making money and will spend some of it to save time and get straight to the content they need. Bored people are not making money and won't pay for Mixergy content because they have all the time in the world to look on torrents or elsewhere.<p>Your free vs. pay formula:<p>I believe this current version of it sounds very savvy. You are giving a lot away, and at exactly the right place, while the premium charge is also mostly for the right things. By making new content always free, you make it easy for people to post and discuss in places such as here on HN. By allowing free embedding on blogs and other sites, you encourage conversation elsewhere. This is important and you've obviously thought about it.<p>Bottom line, let busy people pay to save time and attention. Understand that bored people can't/won't pay, but they may still be loyal fans. Cheers, and good luck with the changes.",1266893784

I don't have a lot of time in the day, and sitting through an hour+ interview can be hard. I'd suggest mixing up the lengths of interviews and maybe doing short quick interviews where the responder can only respond with one sentence or word.<p>Anyway keep up the good work.",1266893781

Let me explain:<p>The number of people that come back and rate a recipe is probably small. And how many people who had a middling experience with the recipe would make the effort to come back and rate it? Or even a good experience, for that matter? A bad one? You bet they're going to rate it.<p>So right there, you have all kinds of bias problems with the data. And just to make it more fun, how many of those people rating the recipes prepared it properly? How many substituted ingredients that just completely ruined the dish? You see this all the time on these sites - ""This recipe is horrible. I vomited for 3 hours straight. BTW I didn't have any red onions so I used pickled cocktail cherries instead.""<p>Somehow you have to find a more indirect way of evaluating a recipe's worth. Maybe it could be a measure of how many times a person comes back to look at it (on the theory that each hit is presumably them coming back to look up that recipe again)? Or perhaps how many people chose to make it.",1266893777

1144445,comment,1144038,1144038,0,0,mhartl,,,"Apart from the usual Gates/Allen, Jobs/Woz, Larry/Sergey anecdotes, there's little evidence that two is a natural lower bound on the number of founders. It's sometimes claimed that a startup is ""too much work"" for one person, but the productivity of individual programmers is not fixed; with today's tools, solo founders can be as productive as a dozen developers from fifteen years ago. Another common argument is that you need a cofounder as a sounding board and as a source of moral support. These roles are vital, but they don't necessarily have to be filled by a cofounder. Einstein needed the help of his friend Michele Besso to develop special relativity, but Besso wasn't a coauthor on <i>Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper</i>.<p>Unfortunately, the need for cofounders is a deeply entrenched belief among investors, so much so that it risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.",1266892963

Fundamentally, why does the Internet enable businesses which scale (out of proportion to headcount, out of proportion to budget, out of proportion to time, etc) in ways which are difficult to imagine for businesses historically?<p>I think you could identify a couple of things here: Google (and the App Store and Twitter and Facebook and all the things you cool people use) is a huge force multiplier for distribution.  OSS is a force multiplier for software development.  Modern web frameworks are a force multiplier for software development.  The whole lean startup ball-o-wax is a force multiplier for customer development.  Cheap outsourcers are a force multiplier for any sort of easily described, easily checkable, repetitive work.  The astounding variety -- an ecosystem of ecosystems -- of companies/APIs which you can just throw trivial time/money at and hook an enterprise-scale solution into your business is a force multiplier for, well, pretty much anything you can think of.  (""Oh effity I have no accounts receivable department full of people whose only job it is to chase down folks who owe me money, get their money, and then make sure it gets to my accounts.  Wait, you mean Paypal makes that irrelevant?  For like a buck a transaction?  And it can be integrated into a website in like an hour?  Whoa!"")<p>Heck, some of these are less multipliers and more exponentiators.<p>The question is -- which if any of the above are not available for you if you have one person but might be available if you have two?  And the answer, I think, is none of them.<p>The barriers are getting further lowered all the time, too, and the things force multipliers are getting better.  A great example of this -- and I swear, it <i>will</i> create several multi-million dollar businesses this year -- is Twilio.  You can now run a telephony company from your freaking kitchen.  Holy ""#$&""#$""#$""# we are living in the future.<p>It's a great time to be single.  (Not that it's a bad time to have co-founders -- I wish y'all the best, too.

Apps do not normally run in the background at all, they are stopped as soon as they're not user visible anymore.

I'm gonna take the liberty of reposting my comment from another thread where this ""review"" cropped up.<p><i>When you hit the home button, the previous application keeps running, which means it keeps eating memory, keeps using processor cycles, and keeps eating battery.....To truly quit most applications requires a multi-step navigation that is neither intuitive nor well-documented.</i><p>That one is one of the most pernicious bits of misinformation about the Android platform. Applications that are no longer visible to the user are NOT ""background"" applications like they are on a desktop OS. Applications that are no longer visible to the user are stopped. They no longer consume CPU resources, but the OS does hold them in memory in case the user returns to the app. Stopped applications may be killed by the OS, thereby freeing up the memory used by them, at any time by the OS when it determines it needs resources. Think of it like caching. The app state is cached in memory so that if you switch momentarily to another app (to answer a call for example) you can return immediately to the previous app with minimal delay and minimal resource cost (ie, the app doesn't need to be re-loaded, etc). The Android developer docs have more information: <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals.html#.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals.html#...</a>.<p>The only things that truly run in the background on Android are service process.

I plan on ramping this up significantly over the next few months, and eventually doing other niches I think will be valuable to this crowd. I also don't need the money, but I agree with Andrew that it sets an example and it creates a seriousness in the project (whereas with a hobby you can get lazy, which I have certainly been).<p>However, my core motivation (and I think Andrew's as well) is to help aspiring entrepreneurs. To do that, I think you want as wide an audience as possible on the videos.<p>There is an empirical question here that is unanswered: whether a paywall will actually increase video usage or not. Andrew will be able to answer that shortly, but I suspect it will not increase usage of the older content.<p>This is why I've made the decision to keep all interviews online and free. Instead any monetization will be done by books and/or DVDs. So here's one more possible trajectory for you:<p>1) Segment your interviews into sub-niches.<p>2) Get good transcripts.<p>3) Add synthesis and commentary around each sub-niche.<p>4) Sell books/dvds around each sub-niche.<p>5) Post the full transcript on each video page to get random SEO traffic.<p>6) Upsell your books/dvds (but not annoyingly).<p>Yes, I realize a lot of the book value will be on the Web (in both video and text form).

Even if VP8 had zero patent risk, libtheora is already written and tested and portable.<p>Am I missing something?",1266891641

That's why you have multiple systems to prevent catastrophic failures.<p>What makes the Therac-25 notable is the novelty of a software problem killing people.

The only reason to move there is to make money. Philadelphia has a lot of nice neighborhoods and accessible cultural amenities.<p>I believe the argument for the necessity of relocating to Boston or Silicon Valley for the kind of stuff ycombinator does has centered on the liquidity event.  My $5 says that avenue to riches will be greatly diminished and that steady cash withdrawals from owner's equity will be a much more popular path to riches, as it has been in most businesses for most of commercial history.  But what do I know.<p>If you want to do something seriously technical that's going to take years and millions, then yeah, I'll allow that it's a good idea to move to a hub city with a deep talent pool and deep pocketed investors.  But that probably doesn't describe 98% of the web and software opportunities (and there are also the many glaring exceptions such as RIMM).  Most sub $10 million software opportunities are probably in straightforward application of the programming craft to solving industry problems, often in conjunction with good business development skills.  The industries and businesses are mostly not in Silicon Valley and Boston.  And you hardly need a city of geniuses to write some software.",1198295240

People have been using it for millennia in their languages (many words change meaning according to their context, context being the ""mode""). Musicians have been using it proficiently for centuries for their music sheets(notes on the music staff change according to tonality, tonality being the ""mode""). Nowadays (most? many?) people use modality every day on their mobile phones (e.g. T9 has a modal keyboard). Could it be that studies about modality were flawed? I think so. For instance, if you teach modality in the wrong way, I agree you will ""realize"" that modality is ineffective. I had an hard time using T9 before being told how to use it effectively, and I have helped a couple of people who hated it as well. And I had an hard time using Vim before being told how to use it effectively.",1342186928

Their data entry system was obscenely awful- an Access database that was used like an Excel spreadsheet- entering in the same data over and over again in different forms. So, I optimised it. Added some forms. Made report templates that printed out automatically. Eventually I stretched the limits of Access and turned it into a full VB.NET (shudder) application. I tried to get the IT department involved but they refused to have anything to do with it- I couldn't even install Visual Studio Express because I didn't have admin rights on my machine- I had to use SharpDevelop.<p>All this happened while I was still an ""administrative assistant"" on a temp wage. After a time, I left- it was time, and in any case they'd said that my work was going to be replaced by an integrated SAP solution that would span the entire company's workflow. I moved on, got a much better job and have been programming off the back of that original job ever since.<p>This was in 2006. I spoke to a former co-worker for the first time in years about six months ago, who told me to my jaw dropping surprise that they were still running my application. Aside from anything else, I was blown away that the thing still worked. There's a certain morbid curiosity that makes me want to look at the code I wrote back then, I'm sure I would cringe.

In my experience, this is a big problem.  If Facebook is saying this is the actual number, then consider is much higher.  Facebook, as well as every player in their ecosystem, is economically incentivized to inflate the usage numbers.  It's why Facebook is ""worth"" what it's worth, and how every single application on the platform is measured for investment.  Games are literally ranked by their daily active users.<p>I spent some time combing through the data of an oldish FB game (as an employee), with about 300k MAU and 150k DAU.  We figured that about 40% of the accounts playing on our game daily were fake, created solely to take advantage of any mechanics where it was advantageous to have more friends.  Some people would have 10 or more accounts.  Now there are businesses sprouting up in countries where labour costs are cheap who sell ""likes""; you can buy thousands for less than a hundred bucks.  Mostly fake accounts.<p>And this is only the blatantly fake accounts.  What about the people who actively, honestly use Facebook, but have lied about minor details that are <i>important</i> to advertisers?  Things like their age, sex, name, jobs, location, whatever?  I did this myself.<p>And yet, the value of the advertising (and Facebook directly) is derived from these measures.<p>><i>""One, going by the name Agung Pratama Sevenfoldism, showed his date of birth as 1997 and said he had been a manager at Chevron in 2010.<p>>Mr Tinmouth said this seemed ""unlikely"".</i><p>I'd say.",1342186133
4239689,comment,4238254,4238775,1,0,drostie,,,"> ""The foremost cause of sexism is the fact that many males (consciously or subconsciously) perceive women as mentally and physically weaker""<p>If this is true, it is not a proximal cause and amounts to armchair psychology. Like I said, sexism today is generally <i>institutional</i> rather than individual. Since you may or may not be familiar with what that means, I will clarify: social institutions are the things in society which you as a member take for granted as aspects of social order, of norms of behaviour, of the sorts of social relationships which you may form with other people. (I like to think of them as: memes which organize societies.)<p>So for example, you are maybe <i>technically</i> correct that sexual harassment is not one and the same as sexism: however, a workplace that allows sexual harassment <i>is</i> a sexist institution, and to complain about widespread sexual harassment <i>is</i> to complain about sexism as a whole.<p>Like I said in the post you are replying to, you are trying to view sexism as an <i>individual's act</i>. But if you look at the way that sexual prejudice and sexual discrimination <i>actually emerge</i> you'll see that it happens because women and men have different role models, different social organizations, different education models, different standards of behaviour, and different norms about what sort of conduct is excusable or inexcusable towards us.<p>Let us return back to the case at hand: a woman has to fend off many requests for sexual favors and many absurd abuses (like licking her tattoo -- do you really think that this person also licks men's tattoos?) simply by virtue of being a lady at this conference. You may object that the individual requests are not sexism per se, they do not promise any special treatment to a woman if she accepts or any inconvenience to a woman if she declines. What you're missing is that taken as a whole the <i>atmosphere</i> generated by these requests does amount to a special treatment and an inconvenience, and therefore as a whole this <i>is</i> sexism.<p>In this respect you have been missing the forest for the trees.",1342186103

The majority of Microsoft's server GUIs are now built completely on PowerShell. This includes basic products like IIS, Exchange, etc. Where I work, most consultants who implement or maintain these products have learned PowerShell and use it regularly. Windows Server 2012's default option is ""headless"" install (Powershell only), and that's been an option since at least Server 08 R2. Powershell is certainly not an afterthought - it is at the core of Microsoft's server administration GUI plans. MS have completely committed to it.",1342185689

If I try to <i>cat</i> a large file to <i>wc -l</i> I have to kill the shell because it starts eating all my memory. Even when the memory is not a problem, it is considerably slower than Cygwin or MinGW. I think that the lines are converted to System.String and cached in memory; if this is the case it might be very hard to solve this without an architectural change.<p>I haven't found any good equivalent of <i>less</i> or <i>grep</i>, things like <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i> are unnecessarily verbose, etc..<p>Also, the text input is not nearly as advanced as readline-based shells (no Ctrl-K, Ctrl-Y, Alt-Backspace, history search, decent completion...).<p>I sincerely hope that someone (MSFT or others) comes up with a better solution.

But judging by the enormous number of upvotes, StackOverflow itself (i.e., the people who make it up) disagrees about that second bit.<p>I fall on the side of Stack Overflow at large.  Programming is, among other things, an art.  Like in any art, there are sometimes situations where there is no objective answer, and the artisan needs to make a judgment call.  And in those cases, a wise artisan may still wish to consider the opinions and experiences of other skilled artisans before deciding on an approach.<p>Stack Overflow has an excellent format for facilitating this, since it allows some people to share their opinion or experience, and for others to indicate whether they have a similar opinion or experience by simply upvoting that answer.  The only thing in Stack Overflow that doesn't actually fit this use case is the green checkbox, but that can be ignored easily enough.<p>A forum, on the other hand, is a terrible fit for that use case.  Forums are for having a conversation, not for getting a quick pulse of what other people are thinking.  They leave no way to contribute other than adding an additional post, and they leave no way to get a quick idea of what everyone else is thinking other than reading every single item in the resulting mountain of posts and manually tabulating it all.<p>It's just possible that the SO masters have fallen out of touch with the SO community.

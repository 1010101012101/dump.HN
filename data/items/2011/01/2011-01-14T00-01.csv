2102040,comment,2101656,2101656,0,0,pavlov,,,"The lack of globalCompositeOperation in IE9's Canvas implementation is a pretty serious limitation.<p>It seems to come down to the limitations of Direct2D, which doesn't seem to support any other compositing operations except source-over, a.k.a. ""normal alpha blending"". This is fairly surprising when taking into account that Direct2D is a very new graphics API (it shipped in Windows 7)...<p>I think the root cause is that Microsoft's graphics APIs have long evolved in a different direction compared to everyone else. Make no mistake, Microsoft is a very important force in graphics because they control Direct3D, and that has placed them at the vanguard of high-performance accelerated 3D graphics.<p>Direct2D seems to mostly take design influence from Direct3D. One of its explicit goals is to provide 2D utility graphics for Direct3D games -- stuff like HUD displays for games. The traditional ""Porter-Duff"" compositing operators (i.e. the blending modes missing from Direct2D) are not very useful in this environment, so instead Direct2D concentrates on ""game-like"" stuff like high-level geometry objects.<p>In contrast, the other major browsers use graphics APIs that fundamentally derive from the Adobe school of print-oriented graphics, where an image is built from low-level immediate mode operators. Think PostScript and PDF.<p>The original Canvas JavaScript implementation shipped in Mac OS X 10.4 to support Dashboard widgets. Canvas was just a paper-thin wrapper over Apple's Quartz API, which in turn was essentially a royalty-free implementation of the PDF graphics model (before Quartz, Apple/NeXT were licensing Display PostScript from Adobe).<p>I think Mozilla's Canvas implementation uses Cairo, which is an open-source library heavily modelled after PDF and Quartz. Chrome uses their home-grown Skia, which is also very similar.<p>Poor Microsoft. If they had taken the opportunity in 2004, they could have easily dictated a simple web graphics standard that would have played to the strengths of the accelerated graphics API that they control. But instead they were busy building giant fortresses of proprietary APIs like the dead-end Windows Presentation Foundation, and now they're having trouble implementing something as superficially simple as Canvas.",1294966620

The only question should be: do his questions have <i>merit</i>?<p>IMHO they clearly do.<p>The thing that absolutely <i>floors</i> me about this is that it prolongs the reliance on Flash, which as Gruber correctly points out, was one of the major factors behind the <video> tag in HTML5 (to get away from <i>requiring</i> proprietary plugins).<p>For the foreseeable future, the smart (and IMHO the only) thing for sites to do is support H.264. To not do so is to potentially alienate hundreds of millions of users, being those using the iDevices (not the least of which is the iPod Touch). Sites may choose to dual-encode in WebM but why would you? Double the processing time and double the storage, for what? A video you can play without using a Flash wrapper?<p>People keep pointing to the GIF precedent. That is tantalizingly similar but it suffers from the same kind of fallacies as comparisons of iOS vs Android to Apple vs Microsoft (Windows) do: it ignores the fact that the times they have a-changed.<p>Consider: I watch an awful lot of video on my iPad. Hardly any of it is in H.264 format. The solution? A $3-4 app called Air Video that transcodes to H.264 on the fly.<p>With the cheapness and abundance of computing power now, let alone 10+ years from now (which is when the tail end of the H.264 patents are and thus when the GIF-like profiteering scenario would presumably come to fruition), why do I care what format <i>anything</i> is in?<p>If MPEG-LA decided to increase the cost of an H.264 license by 10x for a site like Youtube I <i>guarantee</i> you that Google could re-encode every video on Youtube in somewhat reasonable time. And that's <i>today</i>.<p>H.264 is already (perpetually) free for the end user so the it's only the content providers who really matter in this equation.<p>Now I'm not arguing we should go completely in with H.264 and to hell with everything else. I'm all for providing users and sites with choice and for that reason, I fully support WebM.<p>What I don't support is removing the choice of H.264 from users or forcing them to keep using a closed and proprietary plugin (Flash obviously) to watch them.<p>The fact that Chrome bundles Flash is <i>already</i> almost enough reason for me to stop using it. Flash blocker extensions are suboptimal (eg tricks like Flash overlays on sites that kick off all the Flash). Completely uninstalling it is not an option (every page asks you ""You are missing plugins, would you like to install them?"").<p>For me this move may just mean I switch back to Firefox.<p>Lastly, I don't read this as an anti-Apple move at all. It's certainly political but (IMHO) not aimed at Apple specifically. It's more about the philosophy of an open Web. I fully support that. I simply question the wisdom of forcing subpar choices on end users to that end.<p>Also, some here like to point at Apple and ask ""how is this different to Apple not supporting Flash?""<p>That one's easy: It was 3 years after the iPhone's release before Adobe had a full version of Flash that ran on ANY mobile platform (being Android ultimately). If you accept the assertion that Android Flash is sufficient (and that is debatable) why exactly is Apple being blamed for Adobe failing to deliver any kind of sufficient technical solution?<p>If you want to point the finger at anyone point it at Adobe. If they'd been serious they would've jailbroken various iDevices and demoed an iOS version of Flash years ago to make their point, had they had such a thing. The fact that either they didn't or they chose not to demonstrate it, whichever way it goes, means they dropped the ball.<p>Does Apple want Flash? Now? Clearly not and at this point it probably doesn't matter what Adobe does but years ago? Who knows? But criticizing someone for not shipping a nonexistent product is crazy.",1294965853

H.264 has long been the primary choice for video (outside of the Microsoft formats).<p>A lot of people are saying ""boo Apple"" for choosing H.264 for their iOS devices.  This is despite the fact that it really the <i>only</i> viable choice for their users. VP8 was proprietary up until May of last year and Theora is really not comprable with respect to bandwidth and quality.  There was not a viable open format until WebM and at this point H.264 is deeply entrenched.<p>Personally as long as the W3C doesn't declare a format for the video tag (like images) I'm okay with Google's move.  I think its going to greatly slow adoption of the video tag however. At this point most content providers are going to stick with Flash online for their video players so they can then provide the same (unwrapped) video for their users on other devices.  When video content providers are to enocode once in H.264 and use a flash player or encode twice to partially support a now crippled native video tag, I think they are going to stick with one codec, and use flash.

    ));
    yield to.inform(""Thanks for your feedback!"");

The equivalent code with callbacks is as follows:<p><pre><code>    async.prompt(
        [""What are your impressions of async.js?""],
        function (response) {
            async.request(

Apple would not be able to fix any bugs or track down any problems, and judging from their performance on OS X, it would be the source of a lot of crashes Apple couldn't do anything about. Apple might announce iOS 5.0 in June, a few days before or after Flash 11 comes out. Now what does Apple do? Rush to incorporate a major version change into a minor version release? Hold off on releasing until Adobe can get them a stable version? What if it's buggy? Now users who bought a new iPhone with iOS5, or users who updated to iOS5, think that Apple's released a buggy release, when in reality they've released a (probably good) release with a crappy version of Flash. This is exactly what happened with Snow Leopard already, and Apple caught flak for distributing buggy software because Adobe had released security fixes after SL went gold.<p>It's not about control, but determination. Adobe for years hasn't been able to show off a stable, reliable, and performant release, and so in exchange for Apple accepting Adobe's crappy code into the OS, Apple would also lose the ability to speak for the quality of the OS and experience as a whole. It's lose-lose for Apple, so where's the incentive? They got screwed with Snow Leopard, they'd get screwed with iOS, and in the end the ones who suffer are the end users, who can either wonder why their browser is so slow/crashy/laggy/jittery when scrolling, or who can wonder why they don't have Flash, but then shrug it off because most sites don't need it.",1294964680

2101928,comment,2101470,2101470,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This happened before, the relationship between Cepheid luminosity and variation period were worked out with nearby stars that we could measure distance to via parallax. This relationship was used to determine the distance to nearby galaxies and thus establish the basic foundation of the scale of the Universe (e.g. determining the value of the Hubble constant, etc.) However, it turns out there are actually two types of Cepheids and they do not have the same relationship between period and luminosity. This meant that measurements of distances to neighboring galaxies were wrong, since they included a mixture of classical and Type II Cepheids. Fixing that error led to adjustments to the estimated distance to neighboring galaxies by a factor of 4, and a comparable increase in the age and size of the Universe. This solved a fundamental problem at the time, whereby the Earth was older than the Universe (since we can measure the age of the Earth via radiological dating of Uranium, for example).<p>Note that today we have multiple methods for determining the age of the Universe (such as type Ia supernovae, study of the cosmic microwave background, etc.) so this revelation is unlikely to change that, though it's likely to have other implications in our understanding of cosmology.",1294964616

Really good business cards are expensive. Whereas even if you create an e-business card that allows for complete typographical customization, there's no implicit class message because the only difference between a simple, banal card and a beautiful one will be taste (thus I don't think it would be a space worth expanding to; when there's no status message encoded in a design issue like that, the most simple and uniform formatting tends to be privileged.

2101867,comment,2099629,2101416,0,0,tsuraan,,,"<i>That's not nice all in my opinion.</i><p>We definitely have different points of view then.  I see single-implementation languages as things to fear.  Software projects die, sometimes suddenly.  The genius in charge might get hit by a bus, a particular implementation might violate the wrong company's patents, or the owner of an implementation might see an opportunity for profit.  When you have options for language implementations, these risks are at least mitigated.<p><i>Unless I have some strange, specialized need, I want one implementation that is guaranteed to work.</i><p>I'd love guarantees of perfection too, but I've never seen one.  I'm guessing that if I ever did see a guarantee of perfection, I wouldn't be able afford the software it was attached to.  Software Engineering, like every other field of engineering, is about tradeoffs.  Sometimes they're difficult tradeoffs, but it's your job as a professional to inform yourself and make the best decision you can.<p><i>I mean, the point of a garbage collected language is ... I don't have to worry about the garbage. If I have to make special study to find which implementation has "" sane garbage collection"", then this purpose been lost.</i><p>The point of garbage collection is that it allows you to focus on other things first, and then come back and look at your memory use.  Even in a language running on a really advanced GC, like the Oracle JVM, you can't ignore your garbage.  You need to close files when you're done with them or you will run out of file handles unnecessarily.  You need to keep track of your heap use or your program will thrash and your GC will have problems.  There's no silver bullet, but being informed about the details of your platform will help you.<p><i>The various versions are forks and for forking to work, the winner needs to be picked really quickly to allow us to move on.</i><p>Forks are based on common code.  We're talking about separate implementations, with different teams and different goals.  Nobody working on YARV cares whether ruby interacts well with java libraries.  JRuby developers do care.  Different teams, different focus.  I don't think a winner is going to pop out, and I don't see why one is needed.  I do think a better GC for non-JVM ruby would be really good, and somebody probably will make a compliant ruby implementation that has one, but that won't hurt anything.  If it's an overall better implementation people will move to it, and YARV will probably go into the background.<p><i>The thing about C++ is GCC is good enough almost everywhere and any other implementation is going to have to be as good as that.</i><p>The thing about C++ is that it's a standard, not a piece of software.  There are dozens of active implementations focusing on the embedded space, windows, solaris, and other platforms.  No one implementation is the best for all purposes, and a professional chooses the correct tool for the job.<p><i>There are good things about Ruby but dueling implementation breeding uncertainty is not one of them.</i><p>Is anybody really feeling uncertain about ruby's future because it can run on the JVM as well as running in a less dependency-encumbered environment?  I can see people being unhappy about the most common ruby implementation having a crap GC and really bad threading support, but having people working on their own ruby implementations is only going to improve the situation.",1294963246

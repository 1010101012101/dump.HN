6037077,comment,6036385,6036595,2,0,laumars,,,"Depends on your age. When I was at highschool, IBM PCs were just hitting the market. So games developers were still very much a couple of nerds in their garage. This meant that the industry was relatively level pegged (ie I could leave highschool and write a relatively professional game). However these days kids don&#x27;t have that opportunity (generally speaking of course. There&#x27;s still your Minecrafts and other indie games that have gone on to be hugely successful for their developer(s)). These days the entry bar is so much higher that I think that&#x27;s part of the reason so many students are drawn towards web development; where it costs next to nothing to set up a web dev workstation and anyone can throw together a professional looking site. And because of that, the more lower level programming industries are missing out on talented developers.<p>I appreciate that the Raspberry Pi foundation was set up in an attempt to readdress this issue, but I for one consider myself very luck -perhaps more so than this generation of kids- to have grown up in an era where school kids had the same (dis)advantages as the games studios. And I think it was that which cemented my desire to work in IT at such an early age - as I felt part of the industry even though I was just throwing together silly BBC / Amstrad BASIC, and later DOS games in Pascal, for my own amusement.",1373705839

6037035,comment,6033776,6034980,4,0,wrath,,,"I agree with the others, 3 to 4 months is nothing.  As a comparison, it took my current company 2+ years to make enough money that I could live on and 5+ year in order for me to call it a success.  Many times during this 5 year period we thought about closing our doors but we knew we had something, the problem was that what we were selling wasn&#x27;t exactly what our customers wanted.  We pivoted a few times and finally something hit.  We haven&#x27;t looked back ever since.<p>You are probably right that inventory systems are awful for small to medium businesses, so you have a business somewhere.  There are others in your space so that always good validation (<a href=""http://tradegecko.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tradegecko.com</a>).<p>This is what I would do:<p>1. Learn everything you need to know about the inventory pipeline within small businesses.  How they order stock, warehouse it, receive orders, ship it, etc..<p>2. Blog the living hell out of what these small companies do and how you can make their lives better.  This will help your SEO which in my experience is much better than AdWords.<p>3. If you don&#x27;t already have one, produce a roadmap for your product.  You won&#x27;t always be able to stick to your roadmap but making one will do the following:<p>- Help you understand how different you are compared to your competitors.  What makes you (or will make you) so special?  Why should I buy from you?<p>- Help with conversations with potential customers that you are committed to them in the long term by showing them a roadmap.<p>4. Stop blogging about how you failed.  I don&#x27;t want to buy a product from a company that may close tomorrow because they&#x27;re going to fail!!!  I want to buy a product from a company that screams success. Your customers don&#x27;t give a shit about how bad you are at business, they care about solving their problems.<p>5. Keep your product simple, be great at solving one need.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t add a contact manager if you&#x27;re customers are asking for one, but that the contact manager you add isn&#x27;t at the same level as salesforce has it!<p>6. Get known in the inventory management community.  You&#x27;d be surprised how small and thigh nit these communities are.  Sure IBM is huge, but they only have a handful of individuals performing outreach.<p>7. PR, PR, and more PR.  Bug the living crap out of every tech blog, inventory management blog (big enterprise types and small types) and every other blog that fits.  Don&#x27;t pitch them &quot;Have you heard about us!?&quot;,.  Pitch them stories that their users want to read, and by the way, you got your data from Rakasheets.<p>8. Slowly integrate with e-stores and shopping cart platforms such as shopify.<p>9.  Last thing, be patient!  A company isn&#x27;t built in 3 to 4 months, it&#x27;s built with years of sweat and most importantly love for what you do.  You built a product, which is far more than the majority of the people hanging around here have done.  Be proud and &quot;grind&quot; on.<p>Good luck!",1373703764

It&#x27;s UI/UX needs work and some things are a bit quirky (to say the least), but it scales well, works quickly out of the box (basic level), has decent and improving API, integrated graphs, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect and suffers from the same problems as other monitoring systems, but given the options it&#x27;s better then most systems with similar scope.<p>P.S.

We are transgressing the DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) principle.</i><p>Agreed, but this only applies when code is meant to change. It has been pointed out (perhaps by Knuth on Literate Programming) that a good way of explaining something to another person is to do it in two different ways (comment and code), which is practical when code does not change.<p>The follow-up question is why does our code have to change so much. We use toolboxes (IDEs, compilers, version control) optimised for change management. Would it be possible to treat our code like the Clojure/Datomic crowd treat immutable data structures?",1373702556

This patent covers nothing more than <i>tallying the number of times multiple players select a given attribute</i> for their characters in an MMO. That is <i>it</i>. Whether you read it as a (patentese-speaking) engineer or a lawyer, that is literally <i>it</i>. (Unless it gets to a jury, in which case, all bets are off...)<p>That is why, IMO, it is a silly patent, and why I think it should have very limited negotiating leverage. Unfortunately, the current legal system does not differentiate between &quot;infringing&quot; and &quot;infringing on a nigh-useless feature&quot;, and if a lawsuit is involved it is already too expensive to argue this difference. (For the legal-minded around here, from a pseudo-lawyer perspective, I think Rule 11 could use a little tweaking.)<p>All the other comments in this thread talking about the merits of this patent are absolutely baseless because the posters don&#x27;t even know what <i>claims are</i>. Yet, this is the type of rhetoric that drives patent-related discussions on online forums these days. Why should anyone, least of all &quot;your congress-critters&quot;, bother listening to you when you all <i>literally</i> don&#x27;t know what you are talking about?<p>Some other points I&#x27;d like to address:<p>1. You say you could pose the problem to 5 engineers and get a solution -- but what if the <i>problem itself</i> is non-obvious? As an engineer, can you acknowledge that it&#x27;s not always the <i>solution</i> that is clever, but the phrasing of a problem in a certain way, or heck, even the <i>discovery</i> of a problem, that leads to a solution? If so, where does &quot;implementation&quot; end and &quot;invention&quot; begin?<p>2. If you think getting a patent should be exponentially difficult these days, congratulations, you have what you wish for! The way prosecution goes these days, it is almost quantitative, whereby almost any combination of snippets of text in any publication anywhere in the world could be used to show obviousness, it <i>is</i> very difficult to get patents, regardless of the merits. The game now is not to claim &quot;real&quot; inventions, but something narrow enough that combinations of prior art do not &quot;make obvious&quot; yet something that somebody else will stumble upon inadvertently. Which is how you get stupidly narrow patents like this one... which people <i>still end up infringing</i>!<p>The patent system <i>is</i> a bit of a mess, but for many different reasons than what most here think.",1373702478

Anonymous functions (lambdas) have the simple rule - use them when you need a function as an argument to a high-order function (such as filter or map) right here, in this call, because giving it a name and, especially place where you can&#x27;t see its code, is less concise. If a function, it turns out, should be called more than once, it deserves a name.<p>The practice of placing any general functionality in lambdas or blocks will make thing more messy.",1373702465

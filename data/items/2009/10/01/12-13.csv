And with the increased query capabilities of k-v engines the no-mans-land is getting thinner.<p>The incentive to switch is equal to the license fee - the cost of the switch.<p>And possibly the convenience of being able to use cheap non-specialist hardware.<p>For the majority of the companies out there the cloud is still more expensive (and more risky, and privacy sensitive) than storing it on their own infrastructure.<p>But there are solutions in that space as well, having your own on-site 'private cloud', using all of the infrastructural tricks of cloud computing without the loss of control or the service premium.<p>For many big businesses I think that makes good sense.",1254401792

I guess Joe's statement about having interoperability breaks boundaries (see <a href=""http://sadekdrobi.com/2009/09/27/a-piece-of-wisdom-by-joe-armstrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sadekdrobi.com/2009/09/27/a-piece-of-wisdom-by-joe-ar...</a> ) is very important for decision of choice of programming languages. Also the fact that Scala is not a full Actor Model is interesting for audience of InfoQ. The User's Model is very important regarding programming language design since once you get to performance issues you need to look beyond this model to actual implenmentation (I guess you are aware of tutorials that oversemplify concepts like Monads and Lazyness to mention few).\nI am glad you found an interest in the interview, and thank you for your constructive critics.",1254401594

Just because you stop producing it doesn’t mean it’s been wiped from existence. If someone came up to you and used it, you couldn’t help but understand what they just said to you. More importantly, though, there’s no reason why you should stop using perfectly legitimate language just because someone else says it doesn’t make sense, but when it’s obvious that it does make sense, because everyone understands you when you say it.",1254399156

By the most common definition, strong typing seems to mean that you can never have implicit type casts, while with weak typing you can.<p>Again, by common definitions, static typing is when the compiler always knows the types (either through type declarations or type inference) and dynamic typing the types are not known until runtime.<p>Going by these definitions, C uses weak static typing. OCaml uses strong static typing. Python uses weak dynamic typing.<p>By these definitions, haskell <i>IS</i> statically typed because it uses type inference, but the compiler still knows the type at compile time.<p>Paradigms is messy because there are more paradigms that listed in the table and many more hybrids.. I guess its useful as a quick guideline, but I certainly wouldn't base.. well, anything, on this.<p>So, in the end, I have to agree. The table is interesting and fun, but not useful.",1254399082

We essentially buy desktop machines for the engineers and outsource everything else.<p>All our critical business apps are on Google and we can test and scale our software on AWS.<p>It's funny because the last company I founded (Electric Cloud) was specifically doing distributed computing stuff and we had to buy and install tons of servers just to be able to test our code.  Today, founding that company would be totally different... we'd probably buy a few servers for some in house testing of key performance critical elements and then give our credit card to Amazon and buy what we needed as we needed it.",1254398772

It accurately captures the reality that you don&#x27;t know the size of the type, but that you have determined what the maximum size can be and hopefully made considerations for it.<p>I should think there isn&#x27;t even necessarily a performance cost, as it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to trick out a compiler to recognize what was going on and optimize accordingly.<p>> What type would you use if you wanted to print uint128_t? %llld ?<p>IIRC, there is no standard portable format string length modifier for 128-bits (I think some platforms used %q for it, but that&#x27;s definitely not portable), so literally nothing. Format strings suck.<p>> Finally, I think rejecting a standard C header file because it is &quot;ugly&quot; and coming up with your own solution is unnecessarily fragmenting things, especially when it isn&#x27;t clearly better (IMO it is clearly worse).<p>Note that as the presentation points out, the better thing to do is whatever is going to easily adopted. In this case, where people are already using format strings, and already working with a time_t that might be only 32-bits wide, this might actually be that solution.",1380527850

It is important to know, though, that in the battle over reliable sources anything goes - lying, trickery, the basest chicanery. Jaakobou complained that Peace Now - a group devoted to researching the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank - had made up a citation from a government report on the West Bank settlement of Mitzpe Ha&#x27;ai that appeared on the group&#x27;s website. &quot;I went ahead and checked their claim that an official report requested by the Prime Minister stated something on Mitzpe Ha&#x27;ai. The Mitzpe was not mentioned in the original,&quot; he wrote in the discussion on the Reliable sources noticeboard. When someone pointed out the section and page where the settlement was mentioned, he claimed that the mention did not include the specific information that was included in the article. When the original passage was quoted in its entirety, he still didn&#x27;t give up; he claimed that the addition of a satellite photo of the settlement on the web page made the citation unreliable (&quot;citing the content to Peace Now is problematic, since they add their own words and images to wiki-reliable information&quot;).<p>The point is: never give up. If you don&#x27;t win this time, maybe you will win next time.

Investors are piling on because they see these amazing numbers from a <i>shoe store</i> and believe this company has found a new way to sucker people out of their money. And, they have...but, only new people who don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s a scam. So, they need a ton of money to keep reaching new people.<p>Their investor, in a comment in a prior thread here at HN, claimed JustFab could offer such amazing deals(!) by foregoing advertising and new customer acquisition costs. But, I bet that&#x27;s a tremendous lie. I bet they have to spend vastly more on marketing than most shoe stores, because they have to trick an ever growing pool of people into signing on for their bullshit VIP service or their growth will halt. Much like Groupon has <i>tremendous</i> customer acquisition costs, and a very high touch sales channel, JustFab is gonna have to figure out how to keep the funnel working, because old customers aren&#x27;t going to be a thing they get to have.<p>I would give good odds on the following:<p>1. Their customer retention numbers are misrepresented. Probably not blatantly false, but certainly misleading by omission. Their funnel is so misleading as to make it <i>impossible</i> they are actually making people happy with their subscription service.<p>2. Their profit numbers required juggling of expenses to make it look good. As with Groupon, they&#x27;re probably trying to pass off ongoing marketing expenses as one-time expenses. This would be a lie. But, it would not be the first time a venture-backed company lied.<p>3. Their investors are expecting a bigger fool to come along to relieve them of their stake long before the house of cards comes crashing down. They are probably right. It will probably be big, dumb, and slow money that is trying to look smart and agile. Unfortunately, big, dumb, and slow money is often money that most effects less wealthy folks.<p>Needless to say, I am not impressed with this company, its tactics, or its investors. It is a toxic culture that accepts this kind of shady dealings as &quot;business as usual&quot;. This kind of thing shouldn&#x27;t keep popping up every few months...investors should be ashamed of themselves for taking part in this. If the world were sane and just, they&#x27;d all lose their money, and a bit of their credibility. But, the world is not always sane or just. They&#x27;ll probably make out like the bandits they are, just as the early investors in and founders of Groupon made a killing (while the last round of investors lost a fortune). Dishonesty pays off if the lie is big enough, it seems.",1380525417

For a single company, the calculation is simple - settle, it&#x27;s cheaper.

College is the place where I met my co-founder.<p>It is really a great place where you can meet new talented people, learn how to work in a team. Its a place where you can have fights, fall and learn again.<p>It is the place where you learn to present your Idea by presenting it among your friends first. They can help if you lack something. This kind of things are usually not very easy in the outside world. Because the outside world is busy competing with you.<p>You meet so many types of people that you learn to categories the people. What kind of people are A Grade and what kind are B grade. This helps you to when you will start hiring.<p>You say going to college is not worth it. Well another big problem with our thinking is that we think that college is just to learn the &quot;courses&quot;. Well its not. Its a lot more than that. I am also a student in one of the most reputable colleges in India, but the way I think, learning is just a state of mind, place doesn&#x27;t matter. I myself use to think that i have wasted my 4 years learning computer science, that I could have learnt all this in just a year and a half, but today as I am trying to build my startup, I understand that this all connect dots.

6468185,comment,6467379,6467379,55,0,haberman,,,"To me the big story here is that Tessel apparently has a working JS->Lua-bytecode compiler.<p>Lua has by far the smallest, most portable, easy-to-integrate runtime of any embeddable language I am aware of.  JavaScript has good implementations (V8, etc) but they are orders of magnitude larger, more complex, and imposing if you&#x27;re linking them into your binary.<p>If this is truly a robust JS implementation, this means that there is now a tiny, easy-to-embed implementation of the programming language that powers the web.  This could enable JavaScript to start making inroads in the &quot;embedded language&quot; space, and really become the language of both client and server.<p>If it can compile to LuaJIT bytecode also, it could also possibly be competitive in speed with other JS implementations, though some of that would depend on how efficient the resulting bytecode can be.<p>I think this would actually be a cool trend.  Having a code-base that can run either in the browser or &quot;natively&quot; is a powerful approach.  Though Lua is a cleaner language, JavaScript is a totally decent language if you use it right -- much better than a lot of people give it credit for.  Hint: if you think JS sucks because of browser incompatibilities, what you really hate is <i>bad implementations</i> of the language, not the language itself.<p>Of course another approach to achieve &quot;one language&quot; would be to have a Lua->JS compiler (or Lua->asm.js, or a Lua interpreter in asm.js).  But Lua the language is a bit more of a moving target; to preserve cleanliness and orthogonality they sometimes break the language in non-backward-compatible ways.",1380524650

With 2 bits, you can also address 3 things, but then you are wasting precious bits, so it makes sense to try to fill up the address space available. Basically everything inside a computer is based in binary and is therefore held to some relationship with powers of 2. The way these addresses work in hardware is basically to go into a massive decoder that lights up the right bit and makes that bit available. If you don&#x27;t use all your bits, you are basically wasting available logic circuitry.

That, of course, was not the fault of the blog, but of the paper.<p>We need to find a united way forward so I am going to bring together our catering staff, the pupils, councillors and council officials - to ensure that the council continues to provide  healthy, nutrious and attractive school meals.

Why are we putting resource into catering for the tiny minority of a given product which experience mechanical failures which we can fix?<p>90% of BlackBerry users will never change the battery on their device. 100% of BlackBerries have a stupid door on the back which allows you to remove the battery and eventually becomes very loose and slides off.<p>80% of MacBook Retinas (at least) will never have a hardware problem (as long as Apple has finally learned how to correctly apply thermal paste). The ones who do we replace.<p>The economics of replacing an entire device are finally starting to make sense. That's the really exciting thing about this. It is no longer cheaper for Apple to pay technical people in stores and service centres to cater for failure rates in hardware.

A crucial difference from startups is that equity is not tradable, not available to non-working investors, and cannot be taken with you if you leave the firm. Rather than owning securitized shares, you definitionally are entitled to a share of profits while working at the company; and everyone is entitled to the same share. So, for example, if there are 10,000 employees, you have a 1/10,000 claim on any dividends. If you leave the company, you no longer own shares. And there is no way to buy shares; cooperatives will generally only accept investment on bond or loan-like terms, not equity terms.",1339765625

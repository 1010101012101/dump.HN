What Unicode does is say that &quot;this codepoint&quot; means &quot;this&quot;. At that point, fonts start adding glyphs to mean &quot;this&quot; and authors start adding codepoints that refer to &quot;this&quot;.<p>If you look at FontAwesome, it uses characters in the &quot;unicode private use area&quot; -- which are effectively undefined -- but putting those codepoints in your HTML document while having the appropriate font loaded will show the appropriate icon glyphs.",1403013579

For example, if a claim recites elements &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, an individual that practices the invention using elements &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is infringing, and using &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and a new element &quot;C&quot; is infringing, whereas if she only uses element &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;, she is not infringing.<p>In contrast, the transitions &quot;consisting of&quot; and &quot;consisting essentially of &quot; have more limited scope. &quot;Consisting of&quot; means that the device (or method) has the recited elements (or steps) and no more. For example, if a claim recites &quot; A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and the individual uses only &quot;A&quot;, or &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; but not &quot;B&quot;, or even &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;, the claim is not infringed.<p>The meaning of &quot;consisting essentially of&quot; is intermediate to comprising and consisting of. A claim using this transition includes additional elements only if they do not affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claim. &quot; Consisting essentially of&quot; is not often used.</i><p>Drafting a claim to use open-ended language will enable the patent to be as broad as possible. Narrowing the claims to be more specific is the kind of thing that a patent examiner might demand in order to approve the patent.<p>(And this is why you have to employ lawyers whenever patents are involved, as otherwise your opponents will rip you to pieces in court.)",1403013575

A common intro bio lesson is to chew a soda cracker until it begins to get sweet.  Whole wheat breads are sugar with soluble and insoluble materials that aids in moving food material through the gut because we evolved eating a lot of crap that we couldn&#x27;t digest.  So to suggest that I&#x27;ve evolved in 7000 years to digest milk, but not evolved to no longer require fibre requires genetic proof, and I&#x27;ve not seen that study.  Evolution doesn&#x27;t work that way regardless, and certainly not over as little as 200 generations that were geographically locked genetically for all but the last few hundred years.  That said, just because it&#x27;s processed, doesn&#x27;t immediately make it bad for us.  Olive oil, yoghurt, etc... all have some observable health benefits.

7904161,comment,7903061,7903061,25,0,SteveC,,,"As someone who actually runs a Minecraft server and has developed several mini games and around 50 plugins, I&#x27;d like to clarify a few things to people who aren&#x27;t involved in Minecraft.<p>* Minecraft is pretty expensive to host. The top servers are paying tens of thousands a month in hosting. Only a few servers make enough to cover wages. Most just barely scrape by. DDOS protection is pretty much essential to any server over a certain size, which increases costs significantly.<p>* Most Minecraft servers are no longer vanilla Minecraft servers. The Minecraft server software is pretty bad in both functionality and performance. Most servers use Craftbukkit or Spigot, which has a plugin API (Spigot is a patched version of Craftbukkit with mostly performance fixes). Craftbukkit is open source, but is a legally gray area as it contains the decompiled code from the Mojang server. There is an API for writing plugins called Bukkit which is totally separate from the craftbukkit server implementation.<p>* The large servers have tried to work with Mojang to get a set of rules they can work with. Mojang listened to them and actually added clauses prohibiting some of the things they said they needed to even have a chance of this working for them.<p>* While Mojang claim their EULA never allowed servers to make money, their first one actually did. They&#x27;ve also granted written permission to some servers. Last year they had a panel at Minecon were top server owners actually talked about how their server makes money. Despite what their EULA says, Mojang has been basically telling servers it was fine to monetize up until now.<p>* Their new terms force servers to remove perks that have already been sold to players. Many server owners are objecting to this as it forces them to &quot;steal&quot; things that players have bought.<p>* Bungeecord is a proxy system that allows players to switch between multiple servers without logging out. The Minecraft clients multiplayer server list support has barely improved since Alpha. Mojang&#x27;s new EULA treats a bungeecord proxy as a single server. This means that although they allow owners to charge players to access a server, it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to do without inconveniencing players.<p>* The Minecraft network protocol is not patented. A number of open source server implementations exist which do no use any Mojang code. Since these changes have been announced these projects have become much more active with disgruntled developers starting to contribute. It is believed that the EULA cannot legally be enforced on these servers, although one Mojang developer made a statement to the contrary.<p>* No final draft for the new EULA has actually be made available, but a date for compliance has already been set. 1st August 2014.<p>* Mojang released their Realms hosting service worldwide just before making these changes, prompting many to accuse them of trying to eliminate the competition. However, they could simply stop releasing their server software if that was their intention, so most people don&#x27;t believe this to be true.",1403010513

Of course, given the same amount of physical activity, the heavier you are the more calories are required to maintain your current weight, so that eventually this 1.3kg/week would level off.<p>From personal experience, I would say the average weight gain per year in the US is a few kilograms, let&#x27;s say 2.

This would be a logistical nightmare with preparing rooms, early checkins, late checkouts, stayovers, etc. In Vegas forget about it; there are days when a hotel will turn over 1000+ rooms and it would be impossible to do so in an orderly manner. First to checkout are the first cleaned and the first available to whomever is at the front desk. Plain and simple.<p>Inventory in other hotels can get tricky with numerous bed types, room types, room view upgrades, etc. It sounds like a great idea for travelers, but a nightmare for hotels who would have to deal with irate guests if they didn&#x27;t get their desired room.<p>Commodification is a thing right now with hotels (think of all those upsells on planes like extra leg room; a company called Nor1 - <a href=""http://www.nor1.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nor1.com/</a> - is working on streamlining hotel related upgrades) and the 24 hour stay (not so much technology behind this one, it&#x27;s built into their property management systems). So if you check in at 6pm the first day you have to be out by 6pm the next day (or whatever time you checked in). If the 24 hour thing works, pre-checkin room selection might stand a chance and get built in to as a part of the upgrade process (I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d encourage you pick a better view or room type and for a fee).",1403010196

These are pretty constant. They are the bread and butter of politics and have ben since ancient time. When wealth decreases, identity is challenged or political drama whips the mob into a frenzy political instability ensues. So long as those are kept in check, political stability is hard to challenge.<p>If you look at most big stability events (eg the recent riots and protests in Greece), they relate to these. Wealth & political drama. The US banking crisis related to wealth (recession), drama (evolving doors) and identity (corporate welfarism).<p>Abstract ideas like freedom (of X), democracy, equality, privacy, justice, do not have political weight in their own right. To make them count politically they need to become one of the things that matter, bundled into the national mythology, people&#x27;s identity.<p>The US for all their faults, have a genuinely principled foundational mythology/ideology. They can graft principles like privacy onto those making &quot;privacy&quot; into an identity issue. Government spying is offensive to Americans in the same way (though sadly not to the same degree) as a perceived islamization of the UK to the British. Most major political &quot;principle&quot; issues are really identity issues. That&#x27;s why nationalism and religion are impossible to exorcise from politics.<p>Americans seem better positioned to put up a fight against this spying stuff than the rest of us because they already have government-skepticism built into their national identity.

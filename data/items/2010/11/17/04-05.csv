A rule of thumb simplification I go by is: current Python and Ruby implementations are at least 10x slower than C doing algorithmic work.<p>A really good bytecode VM can, of course, get much closer to C performance (as shown by Java, C# or even modern JavaScript implementations) especially if JIT is given enough time to profile the app at runtime and generate highly optimized code based on that profile data.<p>There are of course other aspect you can compare.

In the process Dropbox will get squished or redefined out of existence.<p>I was thinking today: If persistent Flash memory has RAM-like characteristics, why are we still treating it like it's a <i>spinning disk</i>?  Laptops and mobile devices should have a completely different memory hierarchy:<p><pre><code>    - Registers\n    - L1 and L2 cache\n    - Main Memory \n    - Persistent Memory\n    - Cloud Memory\n</code></pre>\nThe 1st three are also what we have today, but the last two are completely new.  Persistent Flash stores are faster but more expensive than spinning magnetic platter.  Cloud Memory is vaster and omnipresent, but much slower and less reliable than the hard drive.  Together, they can fill in each other's weaknesses and create something vastly more useful than the old spinning hard drive.<p>Apple is moving in this direction with their new Macbook Airs, which have taken the first step by taking the MLC Flash chips out of the pointless metal box and placed them on a form factor somewhat like a DIMM.  They have moved even further with the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad.  Here, we have computers as powerful as workstations of the mid-1990s, but there is almost no notion of a Disk Drive.  Instead, files are organized primarily by the Apps that create and manage them.<p>My prediction is that Apple is moving toward a world (at least for the average user) where there are only Apps and your data magically takes care of itself.<p>EDIT: Does anyone else also realize that a big reason our lengthy boot-up procedure even exists is because we had to have a spinning disk?  Now that we have RAM-like stuff that's cheap enough to use in spinning-disk quantities, we don't really need the kinds of boot-up procedures we have now.",1289968979

Off the top of my head, the most memorable points:\n* The rate of change of innovation peaked at the end of the 1960s and people's expectations/aspirations regarding major technological breakthroughs are far lower/more modest than during the era when men were landing on the moon.  (Nixon said that the cure for cancer would take 5 years. We're not going to see a Jetsons robot that does all of your household chores in our lifetimes.) Thiel blames this state of affairs on a dearth of entrepreneurs willing to take the requisite risk.\n* His investments/mentoring is very Silicon Valley centric, but he did make a flattering comment about the high density of intelligent people in Boston.\n* If given the choice between investing in a team of engineers and a team of MBAs, it's a no-brainer.\n* He's steered clear of biotech and cleantech-- too capital intensive, not profitable.\n* He does not believe that there's a shortage of capital per se, but the sweet spot for game-changing technology companies is >$1M and <$1B.\n* Rationale for ""20 under 20"": student loan debt crushes innovation-- people are forced to take high-paying golden handcuffs jobs after graduation.  [As a Ph.D. who is well over 20 and was fortunate enough to graduate debt-free, I hadn't considered this point of view.  Although I'm still dubious about the whole concept, I can appreciate it.]\n* If you're in college, LEARN.  Don't just go for the credential or the high-paying summer internship, take the hardest courses in a field you find interesting and go work for a startup during your breaks.  He cited a recent visit to a business school where 100% of the people he asked admitted to being there to get an MBA and not an education.\n* Don't network for the sole purpose of starting a company, seek out people who are passionate about the same things you are and let business ventures form organically.\n* He's skeptical of programs like YC and TechStars because he thinks that they encourage a cookie cutter approach to building businesses that are not really going to change the world, since the barrier to entry for Web 2.0 startups is so low.\n* Indicators of startup success: 1) CEO pays him/herself <$120K/yr., 2) founding team are not homeowners (although not necessarily in their early 20's).\n* Best one-liner paraphrased: deciding to marry someone based solely on the mutual desire to get married is not the best idea (said in reference to founding a company with someone one barely knows).\n* In response to a question about failures, he stated that he doesn't think one learns too much from failure because there's always a scapegoat and it's often difficult to determine root cause.<p>Disclaimer: views are Peter Thiel's, not necessarily my own and this post is not a comprehensive summary by any means. Search for Twitter hashtags #mitforum and #mitef for 140 character snippets from other audience members and watch for the flurry of blog posts/coverage in the coming days on VentureFizz, BostInnovation, Greenhorn Connect, OnStartups, and Mass High Tech.",1289966872

There should be several stages.  At each stage, a user discovers some pain (I wish I could leave my parents out of this) and then discovers an easy solution.  (Ah ha! I can use this ""parent"" tag and then it prompts me so I can choose to not let my parents see this.)  The user is pleased, until they discover their next pain.  (I don't always want <i>all</i> of my friends to know about...)  The end result is that you've solved the user's pain several times over, and so they love your product.",1289966620

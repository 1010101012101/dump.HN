As far as I know it to be you just need to read faster and stop trying to understand every single word and sentence. Don't try to grok every word just keep reading. The next piece of reading you do will happen that much faster (and faster, and faster). And when you come to something you do need to read and consciously comprehend every word, you'll be able to do that even faster than you could before.",1328529578

He bought one of most expensive cars when he was in his 20s. A Porsche then Mercedes. In his dashing days at Apple and NeXT, he weared the most expensive Brioni suits. He had a Plane. A super expensive plane. Do you know why? He said: ""What I really need is a plane where I can take my family to Hawaii on vacation, go to the East Coast."" He loved to stay in expensive resort hotels. Consumed too much there.

The Dijkstra post yesterday remarked on computers representing a radical novelty, I don't think it's too far a stretch to say this applies to programmers as a profession as well.<p>>On a vertical axis, a programmer … could be writing compilers … On a horizontal axis, they could be experts on databases, or weeding performance out of a GPU, or building concurrent processing libraries, or making physics engines, or doing image processing, or generating 3D models, or writing printer drivers, or using coffeescript, HTML5 and AJAX to build web apps, or using nginx and PHP for writing the LAMP stack the web app is sitting on, or maybe they write networking libraries or do artificial intelligence research. They are all programmers.<p>""They"" could very well mean a single person. What does one call oneself in that case? I don't really like ""Full stack developer"" but it's the best I can think of, besides ""programmer"" that is. Perhaps ""generalist developer"" but that sounds wrong too. I don't do all of those things mentioned but I know how I could learn to do all of them adequately enough to create business value, and the specific things I do actually do are pretty varied. One day I might be writing in C caring about every byte of memory, the next I'm writing in Python and creating and destroying thousands of new objects willy nilly, wasting many megabytes of memory, and not tweaking the GC because the problem doesn't call for those optimizations. Maybe for an hour that evening I'm back in C again but writing a one-off prototype on an embedded system and so I don't bother freeing any of my mallocs or don't bother practicing any decent coding practices that aren't habitual since I know the code will be thrown away after its purpose is served. And the next morning maybe I'm firing up a hundred Amazon instances running NodeJS servers doing stuff with gigabytes of data.<p>I am a programmer. I program things. What, specifically, changes from day to day, sometimes from minute to minute. Trying to pigeonhole me into a specialty like other fields just doesn't work; programming is my specialty. If I'm at a corporation and the bean counters want to call me ""Product X Maintainer"" for a job title just so they can associate it with a salary, fine, whatever. My business card still says ""Programmer"" on it. When people actually want to know what I do, I'd be happy to go into more detail, but it quickly gets verbose and tedious and not very exciting to most people.",1328527402

So I would love for you guys to shoot it down and offer suggestions. Pointing out existing services would be OK too...but not the ultimate goal.<p>Idea: AppSumo + W00t + KickStarter + Ad Platform + Prizes.org = People competing to drive dollars into someone's pocket.<p>Use Case: I, as a startup founder, wants a specific goal (say 300 paid users). I would like to be able to run a campaign that achieves exactly that, and I don't want to pay upfront.<p>This is the workflow. Set a goal, 300 paying users, and get sponsored prizes (not sponsored by me, but someone else that buys attention from this particular campaign) - say Amazon wants to sponsor with 100 Kindles + 37Signals wants to ante up 20 iPads. So the prize pool is 100 Kindles & 20 iPads.<p>Those prizes are awarded to the top 120 'performers'. This would be adjusted by number of prizes and impact the sponsor wants to have. Naturally, the more people competing for the prizes is the more likely the result will be finished quickly. Who can perform? Anyone within that target demographic.<p>In my case, I would want to target designers...so designers that blog and tweet can participate - or rather, would have a higher chance of succeeding. Each participant registers for a unique URL or some trigger that we can attribute to their performance.<p>They then tweet, blog and facebook that campaign. As their referrals convert to customers, they get points. There is a league table that is public so everyone can track how everyone (and the pool) is doing. If there is a time period (say 1 week), and the goal is not completed, no prizes are awarded. If the goal is completed, the prizes are split accordingly (in this case, the top 120 get either a Kindle or an iPad).<p>The platform makes a % cut from the revenue it sends the startup, and possibly from any advertising revenue that is generated (it's possible that companies will eventually bid to be a sponsor...once they become a sponsor, they pay for that slot - plus the prize).<p>So the general idea is that many people benefit - the startup in this case & the advertisers (because the viral campaign is built around their brand, i.e. people are competing for prizes they sponsored).<p><i>phew</i><p>Why can this not work or how can I refine it so it is more easily explained?<p>Anyone interested in either sponsoring prizes or helping get this off the ground? I am a Rails developer.<p>P.S. If you steal it and run with it....well....I am hoping you don't, because it's something I am genuinely interested in.",1328526656

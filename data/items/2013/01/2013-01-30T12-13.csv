When reading that, it struck me as a very disturbing signal indicating problems and suicide risk.<p>I mean, IMHO you make such a tattoo if you're (a) young, stupid and drunk, in which case you might do anything whatsoever or (b) you have a serious internal hurt or a selfesteem issue - and a temporary, fluctuating one, since you felt awesome when you made it, but you knew that you often feel not awesome and need to be reminded of it. Which is something that really correlates to people with clinical depression episodes or bipolar episodes - that also are a big suicide risk.<p>Maybe I'm oversensitive to such signals since I've been thinking a lot about these diseases, but they should matter.",1359550692

IIRC car crashes kill on the order of 30,000 people a year in the US.<p>That said, I have had my engine catch fire while driving down the Interstate. It took me a few seconds to pull over and get out of the car. The best pilot ever isn't about to land a 787 from cruising altitude anywhere near as fast. I can only hope the design keeps the battery fire from endangering life or taking out anything else important in the meantime.<p>But my understanding is the rate of spectacular li-ion battery failures is phenomenally low. Incidents happen, but the vast majority of batteries behave themselves.

I've often times chosen the more expensive option simply because it is more expensive and it has to be better right? If you're cheaper than salesforce, then I view you as an inferior product to salesforce. If you're the same price as salesforce, than you're a salesforce knock off, why not just get the real deal? If you're more expensive than salesforce, oh? Why is that? You're better in x,y,z ways? Perfect. That's exactly what I could use. Offering a lower price works when you view your self as a commodity. You probably don't want to view your SaSS product as a commodity.<p>2. ""I""ll raise prices later"" is a bad approach because SOMEONE will have looked at your sales page the day before and now want the old price. Also, if you say, ""My real price is xxx, but I'm going to charge xx now"", then you also have the added disadvantage of not knowing if you could actually charge xxx later. Furthermore, you might be attracting the wrong types of people via xx pricing, who then mass exodus at xxx, and you would reach the wrong conclusion. You're marketing and pricing brought in a bunch of cheapskates, and yet your revenue would triple by going to xxx, with decreased sales and support costs.",1359549389

5139102,comment,5137859,5138258,1,0,lloeki,,,"> <i>""Hey, here comes a request, let me generate a page just for you""</i><p>In a blogging context, stuff like Wordpress where pages are generated per request, then cached to handle any form of serious load just rubs me the wrong way... Such an infrastructure to display a few pages seems ludicrous.<p>> <i>The default would be to bake out static resources when data changes, and you'd want to automatically track all of the data flows and dependencies within the application. So when your user submits a change, or your cron picks up new data from the FEC, or when your editor hits ""publish"", all of the bits that need to be updated get generated right then.</i><p>... so this is exactly what my WIP custom blog engine (ultimately meant to replace my posterous blog) looks like, initially composed of markdown source and makefiles, then ramped up to some rake tasks and a ruby library. An entity change (edit post, add comment...) should trigger generation of each page referencing it exactly <i>once</i>, and possibly immediately.",1359547584

One is to actually try and do some good via a spot in the Senate. Cynicism might tell you that's not right/too simple. Ignore that feeling.

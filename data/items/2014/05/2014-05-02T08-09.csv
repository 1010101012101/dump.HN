Also &quot;contents of package X&quot; is too general for nix, it&#x27;s &quot;contents of package X built with inputs Y&quot;, you may have the same package X built in different ways in your nix store.\nIt&#x27;s not impossible, there&#x27;s the need of a service that provides information on what packages provide a certain file.",1399021087

Two flipping days working out why an NMI wasn&#x27;t being captured by the kernel interrupt handler in a communications controller I was working on. The NMI handler religiously stopped working after ten minutes. Turned out some chump had bent the CPU _NMI pin in the socket of the device at the manufacturer and it wasn&#x27;t contacting the socket reliably so when it warmed up it started floating. However, you couldn&#x27;t see it with visual inspection. I assumed it was my fault and spent hours with the assembler and Z80 and vendor docs trying to work out why it wasn&#x27;t working. Got miffed, plugged in a logic analyser which caused it to work perfectly.<p>Eventually I assumed the CPU was duff, gave a finger to the rules which involved not changing the hardware, yanked it and found the inverted pin.

The best part was that they didn&#x27;t offer their timesharing service at night, so basically I had the computer to myself.<p>We didn&#x27;t have anything like electrocardiograms, but the neat thing was to see what kind of program you could write on a single card. Did you have any of the bird chirp cards that would toggle the front panel speaker and put out a whole flurry of bird sounds?<p>My favorite (or at least most useful) one-card program was when I found the print card: Put this card first in the card reader ahead of a stack of other cards, and it would print out the whole deck!<p>Only problem was that the print card was single buffered. It would read a card, then print it. Then read the next card, then print it. And on and on, with the card reader waiting while you print, and the printer waiting while you read the next card.<p>So I figured out a way to double-buffer the print routine: It read the next line while printing the one before, so it was much faster than before.<p>And it still fit on a single card!<p>80 columns should be enough for anyone.",1399020796

The implication is events are harder.<p>> suddenly every bit of state in it can be shared by all threads.<p>Long overlapping chains of callbacks have similar issues. Points where concurrency contexts switch are much larger (between callbacks instead of between machine instructions) but in a large system the danger is real.<p>> Reasoning about code paths and data accesses becomes amazingly complicated.<p>Based on working on large systems based on callbacks and based on threads, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that both are hard, but callbacks are much harder and messier.<p>> Where are these servers?<p>There are everywhere. Java, C++ backend systems. Twitter is using Scala. WhatsApp is using Erlang. PostgreSQL has background processes that help. Apache is the most popular web server.<p>Now are you saying &quot;where they are?&quot; because we don&#x27;t read about them on HN every day?

7684614,comment,7684456,7684536,16,0,ndeine,,,"/dev/urandom is a perfectly fine source of machine-generated randomness. In order to break /dev/urandom (but not /dev/random), you need to find a corner-case where you can break the cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) only when you can make certain guesses about its seed values. Since making those guesses about its seed values in the first place from the CSPRNG&#x27;s output is a hard problem, and making an accurate guess about what eventually happened to the CSPRNG&#x27;s output is a hard problem, this is pretty unlikely.<p>But let&#x27;s quote the kernel source on the matter[1], just to be clear:<p>> The two other interfaces are two character devices /dev/random and\n/dev/urandom. /dev/random is suitable for use when very high\nquality randomness is desired (for example, for key generation or\none-time pads), as it will only return a maximum of the number of\nbits of randomness (as estimated by the random number generator)\ncontained in the entropy pool.<p>> The /dev/urandom device does not have this limit, and will return\nas many bytes as are requested. As more and more random bytes are\nrequested without giving time for the entropy pool to recharge,\nthis will result in random numbers that are merely cryptographically\nstrong. For many applications, however, this is acceptable.<p>The real point to be made here is that, yes, /dev/random is theoretically better - but for many applications, letting /dev/random hang to wait for entropy is worse than having /dev/urandom use a CSPRNG in a way that is generally recognized to be secure.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://repo.or.cz/w/davej-history.git/blob/d0562c8dc:/drivers/char/random.c#l107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repo.or.cz/w/davej-history.git/blob/d0562c8dc:/driver...</a><p><i></i>Edit<i></i>:<p>I would like to add that the original article is talking about using /dev/urandom to generate <i>long-lived keys</i>, not session keys or similar. In this case, the blocking is sometimes acceptable to generate appropriate entropy, since the fact that the key is long-lived implies that you don&#x27;t do this very often. The argument for /dev/urandom only holds clout when you are making a tradeoff for non-blocking behavior (which is 99% of the time). As such, there is nothing wrong with being slightly paranoid and using /dev/random if you can afford the time spent collecting entropy.",1399019134

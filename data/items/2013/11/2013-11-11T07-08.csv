Its a little different than the common implementation of y combinator, but looks cooler imo :)<p>edit: also, a question - a comment on stackoverflow says that fixed-point combinators are used to prove the turing-completeness of lambda calculus. Can&#x27;t it be proved with something simpler, such as that?<p><pre><code>  y = (f) -> (n) -> (f f) n
  fact = y (f) -> (n) -> if n is 0 then 1 else n * (f f) n-1</code></pre>",1384156680

  content, where niche Web publishers are expanding their audiences by
  merging with rivals and buying providers of other genres. Alloy Digital and
  Break Media, both of which focus on young male audiences, last month
  said they would combine to become Defy Media.

  Both [Vox & Curbed] generate most of their revenue by creating customized
  advertisements for brands, rather than relying on traditional display ads.

Here&#x27;s my experience six weeks in.<p>I found enough freelance work pretty much immediately to pay my bills, and didn&#x27;t have to drop my rates. That said, my wife has a successful small business, and I have over a year&#x27;s runway, so there&#x27;s much less pressure.<p>It forced me to become more &#x27;social&#x27;, and attend meetups (including HN London) and other events. Although I&#x27;m getting some work through meetups, the major benefit is in staving off the loneliness you may get from working remotely/at home/from a coffee shop. Coming from working in a great team, my experience is this hits you hard.<p>Meeting lots of new clients and potential clients has been seriously fun. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. I even dipped my toe in Elance, which has been a surprisingly positive experience so far.<p>I&#x27;ve never been busier or more motivated. I wake at 5.30am but now walk the dog, make time for my wife and take time out to explicitly learn new things when I like, not when a schedule dictates. That alone was worth quitting. My advice, for whatever it&#x27;s worth, is to be rigid about dedicating &#x27;off&#x27; time. (No mobile!) Even just half a day a week has safeguarded my mental health so far, and it&#x27;s very, very easy to skip it.<p>I&#x27;ve been able to work on my startup[0] a good three days a week, as well as launching a couple of other smaller side projects already. If possible, I strongly recommend having a big project so you feel like you&#x27;ve got an anchor, and can make forward progress whenever you&#x27;re at a loose end and you might otherwise be checking HN.<p>Quitting full-time work has been the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made.<p>[0] <a href=""http://databasify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://databasify.com</a>",1384156416

My mentor is really good teacher and at the same time &quot;to struggle is to learn&quot;.<p>After two years, we have 9 more team members, an office. We have built our own LMS to train more people remotely. We have bootcamps running in MV and Seattle. We also have consulting projects. We are working with other entreprenuers and helping them with their startups.<p>Gmail, ASANA, Skype and screen sharing tools make the world flat for us.

2. Company is about the people not the revenue. This is very critical in a remote setup, you must value your teammates as if they are your family.

6710445,comment,6710232,6710232,95,0,jxf,,,"From the article:<p>> The Amazon contract will be a much-needed financial boost to the Postal Service, which continues to bleed red ink as more Americans eschew &quot;snail mail&quot; in favor of email, instant messaging and social networks. The agency, which said it expects to lose around $6 billion this year, has been closing locations and has proposed ceasing Saturday delivery of many items to cut costs.<p>But the USPS is, operationally speaking, profitable; it makes about $400M in operating profit per year. So where does the $6B loss come from? It turns out that the overwhelming chunk of USPS expenses are due to a 2006 Congressional mandate that forces the agency to prepay for <i>75 years</i> of benefits.<p>In other words, Congress believes that a hypothetical 30-year-old USPS employee&#x27;s benefit costs need to be fully covered at current levels for 75 years, when the employee would then be 105. Likewise, a retiring 60-year-old USPS employee&#x27;s pension benefits need to be fully covered for 75 years out -- when the retiree would then be 135 years old.<p>So, if USPS wants to hire, say, a new mail carrier whose benefits are worth (say) $20,000/year, they must immediately pay $1.5M into the fund (it&#x27;s actually higher than that because there is a discount factor applied to account for interest and rising health care costs). Imagine if your startup or small business were held to the same requirements, and any reasonable person can see this is insanity.<p>Here&#x27;s a WaPo article covering the problem in more detail:<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/02/08/mandate-pushed-postal-service-into-the-red-for-first-quarter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/02/0...</a>",1384155105

I hardly ever need to type snippets of code with zero context around them, which is what REPL&#x27;s offer.<p>This is why we Lisp developers have networked REPLs -- I can start up a remote JVM, in communication with other services, connected to my local vim session.

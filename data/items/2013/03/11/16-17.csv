One of many who never met her in College. I guess my point is that sometimes you get lucky, and that place is in College. But the cost of college is high, and you don't know the value of the things you would do if you didn't go to college. Clearly you in particular would have lost the chance to meet the love of your life, but there is no way for somebody to know that looking forward to the choice, rather than back on the experience.",1363021177

Not open tabs, which continually consume memory and CPU resources until you get around to them.  And not bookmarks either, which are meant for permanent storage, subject to the clunkiness of navigating a folder structure and explicitly performing every add and delete operation.<p>So in a sense, One-Tab is indeed a memory saver.  Not by really reducing Chrome's memory usage, but by plugging the workflow gap that induces users to use Chrome in a way that consumes enormous amounts of memory.

I'd like to disagree with you on that point. Yes, you get ideas passed down to your by others, but if you do not bother to examine them and act blindly on the premise that these things must be right, because others told you, without putting any deliberation into the truth of these moral dictates, then...how to get this across without seeming as angry and ranty as I am? Because things like this viscerally disgust me. My parent taught me they didn't care (or couldn't), my school taught me I was in the wrong place, and my peers taught me that I was scum. And I didn't act on those morals, or I wouldn't be writing this paragraph, nor living, nor breathing. Of course, this didn't last forever. I recovered, and I learned how to deal with people. But what you just said, that I...I was defective for not leaving a place that obviously didn't welcome me, the implication that I should have crossed hades, that's worse than telling me to ""go die"", because you said it with moral righteousness.<p>Now I know you're talking about 14 year olds that spy on girls, and I don't think that's morally right either, but your explanation of why it isn't, it's just...wrong somehow.<p>Firstof, they're not defective. Don't even say a child is broken. Misunderstood? Maybe. Misled? Maybe. But not broken nor defective nor hopeless. Because when you take a child, filled with expectations and hope, trying to make sense of the things that happen in the world, and you tell them they're broken, you're killing them. Yes, some might recover from it, just as someone shot might survive, but you and I agree that shooting a kid is still a pretty bad thing to do, no matter whether they survive or not, right? So don't do it.<p>Ok, so after I've vented some of my anger, and proably shared way to personal details with everyone on here, back to business. Society is a pretty bad measuring stick for morals. Define the ""average morals"" to be the reference point, and Schindler becomes the most amoral man in the third reich. You see how this averaging is a pretty bad idea, right? Ok. Then to the disciplining thing. There's a difference between teaching something to your kids, and threatening them to do something. Teaching leads to moral understanding and a moral code. Threats will only teach that might is right, and the only thing holding together morals is violence. I think this worldview does point towards why religious people often ask atheist why they don't think the world will collapse into anarchy without the concept of a hell. Because hell is violence as the foundation of morals. If you want to affect any of those kids, go out and teach them why it's wrong instead of threatening to hit them if they do it again.<p><i>TL;DR: As a past victim of social ostracism, post makes me angry. Average morals are a bad idea. Disciplining kids will lead to obedience from threat, not to morals. Teaching will. So go teach</i>",1363021050

5357966,comment,5356731,5356731,2,0,Silhouette,,,"Good. Having gone to a very well regarded university in the UK in my time, the attitude of a lot of the academics regarding teaching undergraduates was not just poor but offensively so, and the institutional complacency was staggering. At the same time, there was a relatively small but exceptionally hard-working and dedicated set who clearly worked hard on their presentation for lectures etc. and who clearly made a real effort to support the undergrads.<p>Today, undergraduates pay thousands of pounds per year for the ""privilege"" of that kind of education, and the UK hasn't developed the culture of some other countries that have always had expensive education systems in terms of employers recognising the debts students have taken on and paying compensation accordingly. Indeed, with something like half of young people now being pushed into a higher education system that used to train perhaps the top 5-10% academically of the year group, a lot of kids are graduating and finding their degree still won't stop them literally stacking shelves or making telesales calls for a living.<p>If someone can take advantage of modern technologies so that all people at that stage in their education could benefit from the kind of hard-working and gifted teachers I mentioned, at a fraction of the cost, and without putting up with the arrogant, patronising or simply lazy attitudes of probably the majority of academics who wind up teaching them, then the kind of university that can only offer the latter deserves to die, while the services that provide a better education and the good people behind them deserve to flourish.",1363020803

5357964,comment,5356527,5356863,5,0,IgorPartola,,,"I recently started playing with MSP430's. They are fun devices and I think there are lots of possibilities with those. I have no real experience with other uC's so I can't say anything about others or compare. Having said that, here are some very basic impressions:<p>TI's example code is often confusing and over-engineered. It is much better to find advice on blogs and forums instead.<p>The community has some great individuals that will produce great examples and tutorials. Unfortunately, it is very far removed from places like GitHub. Almost all code is shared directly in the forums at 43oh.com.<p>There are a couple of big projects surrounding MSP430's. Energia is, from what I understand, an Arduino-like IDE which lets you program at a much higher level, but at the cost of some performance. When you only have 512 bytes of RAM, it may or may not be an issue. Another one is BSP430 which is a lower level set of libraries. It promises much higher level abstractions at the cost of small performance penalties. I found the tutorials to be rather terse, but I may need to give it more time.<p>Outside of those big projects, there is lots of duplication of effort. It is typical to see 3-5 different implementations of bit-banging UART drivers that are all slightly different. I am no exception, as I started writing my own little set of libraries for dealing with various peripherals.<p>Lastly, a lot of the tutorials out there either use the register names directly (P2IE, P1SEL, etc) or provide really poorly named abstractions (cal_adc_15t30). Most of my time working with it so far has been spent on naming functions something like gpio_get_val(), uart_puts(), etc.<p>P.S.: Physical hardware buttons are terrible devices. Debouncing them is a must and most implementations in the wild are incorrect.

If that's where the author's been getting their ideas about UX, it's no wonder they don't see the value.<p>The ability to understand your users, then prioritize and design an experience that will serve their needs while balancing business requirements and the need for speed to get to market is far more than ""common sense.""<p>A hierarchy of things _you_ want is not going to get you to a good experience.<p>If you need to build an MVP quickly, and don't want your UX to suck (and you can't get a dedicated UX person on your team), I would provide this alternate set of steps:<p>1. Know who you're building it for. Remember the mantra ""you are not your users."" Even if it just means reading some published data or articles about your users, or having a chat with a few people, anything is better than nothing. Start from their perspective, not your own.<p>2. Tell yourself a story. The best way to design a product is to design the story of your product. Instead of starting with features and hierarchies, start by going up to the whiteboard and drawing a few user flows. Name your user, so you're thinking of them like a real person. (DON'T make complicated profiles or use silly names. It's enough to just think ""would Sally want to do this?"")<p>3. Use your story to design your features. If there was something in your flow that was vital, then use that feature. If you found yourself saying ""yes, but she could always do -n- instead for now,"" it's non-essential, and you can leave it out.<p>4. Grok usability. If you don't have anyone on your team who knows what Fitt's Law is, or why the 10 Heuristics matter, find someone who does. This is where ""common sense"" leads most people, graphic designers especially, into pitfalls. There are a lot of UX professionals who are happy to give your product a once-over and point out the hidden traps you might have missed. You probably have a friend who does this for a living, and would love to help you.<p>5. Build early, iterate often. This is where the author gets it right. There's no substitute for the real world. Instead of long periods of usability testing on prototypes, if you can handle an imperfect product going live, you're better off watching how real users deal with it, and iterating quickly when problems arise. Use tools like Crazyegg, Clicktale, or Mouseflow to see what's really happening and react. Don't wait for users to tell you what's wrong, because they often can't (or won't bother to) articulate the problem for you.",1363020310

In reality, it probably gets more inbound links via social networking in a single day on most days, and unsurprisingly those personal recommendations often drive more inbound traffic than any search engine.<p>Google's basic premise of ranking the importance of a site based on how many links it gets and where from is wildly inaccurate in the era of social networking. Normal people mostly don't run their own public web sites or blogs any more, they share stuff on sites like Facebook and often only with their ""friends"".<p>Personally, I think this is a good thing, because both as a visitor and as someone running sites I would rather rely on legitimate personal recommendations from people who are genuinely interested in a site than on some arbitrary algorithm running in a data centre somewhere on another continent.

5357873,comment,5357433,5357527,1,0,homeomorphic,,,"Version 0.8 isn't version 0.80. A version number is a sequence of natural numbers, ordered lexicographically and written with periods separating elements. The version (x1, x2, ...) compares to the version (y1, y2, ...) as follows: If x1 =/= y1, then whichever of x1 and y1 is bigger decides which version is the highest. Otherwise, recurse and compare the versions (x2, x3, ...) and (y2, y3, ...).<p>You <i>can</i> think of a decimal number in the same way (well, leaving out some minor technicalities with numbers requiring infinite expansions here), but you then have to allow only numbers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) in your sequence. Let's leave out positive numbers (because otherwise we'd have to grow sequences in both directions from the decimal point, which is an annoying technicality). Then 0.12345 is simply the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which in version notation is 0.1.2.3.4.5. On the other hand, decimal 0.80 is version 0.8.0, not version 0.80.<p><i>Really</i>, all in all, version numbers are just decimal expansions, <i>except</i> that we leave out the equivalence relation that says that, for example, 10x10^1 is the same as 1x10^2. So while 0.8.0 and 0.80.0 are distinct version numbers, they collapse to the same value as <i>real numbers</i> (or you might want to collapse 0.80.0 to 8.0 -- it doesn't matter, that's all a matter of taste).",1363020049

Experimental economics is an example of a field with very interesting, solid scientific insights.<p>Unfortunately, far too much of the social sciences are funded by extrmely politically motivated and/or sensitive organizations.  A big bias I've seen in social sciences, which is present in this particular case, is an acute and completely non-scientific aversion to ""blaming the victim.""  There is clear, and obvious to the layman push to always blame external factors, despite the obvious and persistent presence of possible internal factors.<p>Poverty isn't rape.  Victims can often times be at least partially to blame for their state.  However, these studies are often funded by sympathetic groups who are seeking to ascribe external causes whenever possible.<p>If you have ever known a severely depressed person, I can assure you that they will find a way to make themselves poor very quickly.  I could insert my many, many family members and friends who have struggled with depression into this, but it would all be anecdotal.  Instead, I'll stay abstract:<p>1) Depression lowers energy levels\n2) Depression drastically inhibits motivation\n3) Depression destroys relationships\n4) Depression causes self-destructive behavior<p>All of these things, by themselves, will serve to decrease a person's income.  Put them all together and you have a poor person in the making.<p>Couldn't resist 1 anecdote:  My mother was given a very, very generous alimony (house, car, shitloads of money) by my father.  She was depressed.  She blew through it all.  Never got off her ass.  Self-destructive behavior meant she drank away her medication's effectivesss.  She's been broke (homeless half the time) for the last 25 years.  Poverty didn't cause her depression.  Depression (and lots of bad decisions) causer her poverty.",1363019581

What works for a small local website, doesn't have to work for a big casino/travel website and vice versa.<p>The advice I gave was sincere though. In practice I see many businesses aiming for links, when their content just isn't up to par. Quality content alone (without links) is enough to rank in many niches. If you get to the hyper-competative SERPS, sure, you can't escape link building or doing most of the work in-house. Droll: If you are about to enter a hyper-competative niche, you should already know what you are doing, else there is little chance you succeed.<p>For me, in practice, creating accessible content is still one of the best things start-ups can do. Blog about two times a week and you will rank for it, you don't necessarily need backlinks. If you got an inaccessible site with poor content, you need (probably to buy) backlinks to make a dent.<p>Disclaimer advice: Never stake your business model on uncustomized broad SEO advice.

This is people throwing every last feature -- even if it has a pile of 800kb of DLLs/SOs attached -- into every app, with no regard for memory.<p>I find my system thrashing almost daily at this point. I need to upgrade. Two years ago, running predominantly the same software, 4Gb was just barely not enough, and I upgraded to 8Gb. And two years before that, cut the memory requirements in half again. And again, and again, until you get back to the 1Mb of RAM I had in 1990.<p>There has been a trend to do exactly what you say you want for 30+ years. And you know, some of that extra memory has been used to great effect -- we can do a ton more now than we could in 1990. But a lot of it is wasted, just Because It's Easy.<p>And that wasted RAM means pointless upgrades every two years; 99% of the bloat at this point is for something I don't need or want. The ONLY valid reasons to need 16Gb+ are if you're actually using that much data in one place -- a server that needs to scale, for instance, or editing video, or maybe a game that uses crazy amounts of data and/or video.<p>That the same apps are bloating 2x every two years -- and as a result get slower, since hard drive and memory speeds certainly aren't doubling every two years -- is really unacceptable laziness on the parts of companies and developers in general.

This way, you could 1) do the incremental changes you want (instead of throwing away one language wholesale and learning another from scratch), 2) recycle the execution environment you <i>have</i> to use (e.g., at work, instead of being forced to switch), 3) broaden your horizons in a fundamental way (learn about type systems, implementation techniques etc.).<p>""But it's so much more efficient to just become better at the languages and frameworks you use at work and then use that experience to become good at new technologies for that area.""<p>That's exactly in line in what I'm suggesting.

So I think the media focus on drug-resistant bacteria is oversimplified.   Why would someone die from a bacterial infection while receiving appropriate antibiotics?  One reason is that the antibiotics can't reach the bacteria -- for example if the bacteria are organized into an abscess or biofilm.  Another reason is that the body can overreact to the infection, and the patient can die from their immune response rather than the infection itself -- this is called sepsis.  Other problems with antibiotics: culture results (which tell you which antibiotic to use) can take a few days, antibiotics frequently have side effects, and it's frequently unclear when the infection is fully treated and the antibiotics can be stopped.  I felt a need to respond because a politician reading articles in the popular media will get a distorted view of what is actually needed in hospitals, potentially leading to inappropriate research funding priorities.",1363018774

5357687,comment,5356267,5356267,1,0,cpprototypes,,,"As I'm getting older, efficiency in use of time is becoming a very significant constraint.  And I've found that learning a lot of languages is a waste of time.  It's mostly enough to just know two types, one static, somewhat low level language (Java, C++, etc.) and one dynamic, high level language (Ruby, JS, Python, etc.)  I've decided that for me, those two languages will be Java and Javascript.  Not because they are vastly better than the alternatives.  But for the following reasons:<p>1) I already have years of experience in Java.  And it's not a dead field.  There's Java 1.8 coming out, new libraries, frameworks etc.  And there's the added benefit that I can convince my workplace to adopt these things since they use Java.  That way I can efficiently use my work time to make money and learn new technologies at the same time.<p>2) I also have years of experience in Javascript.  And I've discovered that Node.js can cover all the areas that I wanted Python to cover.  It's good enough for rapid prototyping web apps, command line scripts, and quick testing of algorithms.<p>I came to this conclusion after time spent fighting a futile battle to become good at Python.  Learning the syntax was easy, there's nothing in Python that was difficult to understand.  However, I ran into the following issues trying to truly master Python or any other language I don't use at work:<p>1) Zero reinforcement unless I spend my own personal time doing it.  At work, I'm using Java and Javascript 40 or more hours per week.  And those hours are when I'm at my most alert and energetic.  Python could only be at night and when I'm tired.  Marriage will reduce that free time, and kids will reduce it further.<p>2) Zero synergy from other developers.  A workplace is also a community of developers.  My Java and JS skills stay sharp and increase because I can constantly talk and discuss with other developers.  I learn best practices, things to avoid, trends, etc.  I get none of this with Python unless again I spend personal time to do it.<p>3) I made some small projects with Python.  But a moment came when I realized, it doesn't matter, I'll never even come close to how good I am at Java and JS with Python.  It was when I read some random post somewhere about how requests library is so much better than urllib/urllib2.  And indeed it is.  But if I had not seen that random post, how long would I have stayed ignorant until I found out?  For someone who uses Python at work, such knowledge spreads quickly.  Also just staying up to date on what's happening in the Python world can help gain such knowledge.  I was already spending time keeping up to date with the Java and JS worlds.  I just didn't have time to keep up with Python too.<p>I really liked Python a lot.  It's a clean and practical language.  But node.js fits much better with my skills and although I like the Python language better than JS, I'm a lot better at JS and will continue to be so since I use it at work.<p>I guess the TLDR of this is that yes you can try to learn and become good at a language and its community of libraries and frameworks in your personal time.  But it's so much more efficient to just become better at the languages and frameworks you use at work and then use that experience to become good at new technologies for that area.<p>Perhaps the final breaking point that lead me to abandoning Python in my personal time is when I realized, I could've spent all that time building something on the side.  I could've used my existing Java and JS skills to make an app or website or anything.  And I could've done it fast, quickly, and with the confidence that comes from truly mastering development tools.  Instead I wasted it to gain a useless amateur understanding of Python.",1363018756

Things got worsen months ago, GFW got technical upgrade which enabled it to interfere even OpenVPN and SSH tunnel which had worked fine for a long time. I had used openvpn and astrill for 2 years, worked perfectly okay (to bypass internet filtering instead of privacy concern), GFW could not do anything to them but after the tech upgrade, no matter how I config protocol, port, TLS, MTU, no matter where the server is, the VPN connection could not be established or last no longer than 5 minutes. Tor? Too slow.<p>We guess the big brother has been collecting commercial VPN services data or GFW gained ability to operate based on packet behavior.<p>Im not saying my whole life is total f*cked because of that but the truth is that Im and so many people here are really angered and frustrated.

And this overlap becomes obvious as people inevitably ask for Chrome or OneTab to allow them to cluster tabs by topic/project -- because a linear scan is never going to 'work' for people who leave enough tabs open that it becomes a 'problem'.<p>The underlying problem here is workflow.<p>People are leaving tabs open as a reminder of things to which they intend to return.  (Regardless of whether they will or not; that's another discussion.)  And they're not bookmarking, because bookmarking begs organizational overhead, which leads to its own mess. (neither tags nor folders are great or sufficient)<p>And who knows if a bookmark will still point to the content you intended, when you finally get back to it?<p>So the problem is ultimately that bookmarking is broken, both for quick reference and longer-term storage.  So why not fix <i>that</i>?<p>Why not a system where bookmarking a site saves a copy to a (cloud-stored) cache. [1]  And then searches can be done on the content in that cache. And hits can be served both from the cache, and a simultaneously downloaded 'live' result, available with a toggle. [2]<p>So that one can bookmark a brag-post about a neat jquery-enabled dropdown list and not have to worry about categorizing it, nor whether or not it will be there in a year, <i>and</i> be confident that they can refer to it again with a simple search of any of the key words that occur to them. [3]<p>[1] Because one can never know what will happen to content online (changes, broken links, takedowns, etc) and doing a federated search across thousands of bookmarked sites looking for 'jquery dropdown' is going to be a nightmare.<p>[2]  Room here for a great feature of non-trivial difficulty: change-detection and display of diffs (if any) rendered in-line.<p>[3]  Or even searching by meta-data such as date-of-bookmark, location or source-device.  ""That thing I was reading on my phone last spring, when I was stuck in Chicago on business..."" can be surprisingly useful when searching.",1363017815

A blacklisting organisation (voluntary, I think) contacted my ISP to tell them I was going on their list unless I could explain what had happened. I spent a very long, depressing email conversation explaining to them exactly what database poisoning was, and why the spammers would include unrelated URLs in a spam email. So many ways to fail at that kind of endeavour...<p>(The URL was for my open source project. Clearly, they didn't even check the webpage before issuing their threat.)",1232797777

The service can't become popular unless developers make use of it and help grow it, but you don't want to spend time developing against an API that isn't already large enough that it's not going to go away.<p>I always thought/hoped that Google had a large enough and mature enough infrastructure (including people, process, tech) that it could support a lot of essentially one-off services (at least as far as income generating goes) because the core services are so big.  And that this infrastructure would give these smaller things time to incubate and gain significant traction.  There's something to be said for a small service that's been running and been available forever, that its existence is stable and the choice is secure.  Things don't seem to be getting a chance to properly incubate though.",1232797642

I completely fail too see what your point is here. Why would my management ask me to work 10 extra hours a week? What does that have to do with deflation?<p><i>> Well they're certainly avoiding the whole ""pushing up"" part.</i><p>How come rates go up then? What evidence do you have that they're 'avoiding' the pushing up of rates? Where is all the consumer inflation that they are allegedly creating?<p><i>> If they were smoothing the cycles out in a sustainable manner, we wouldn't be talking about negative interest rates.</i><p>Yes they would, because we are entering a potential depression. Smoothing out means cutting when things are bad and increasing when things are good. You have to act at both ends to achieve stable prices.<p><i>> Instead, they lower interest rates and keep them there because economic reality is politically inconvenient.</i><p>You are very good at making outlandish claims and not so good at backing them up. What evidence do you have that  central banks have departed from their mandated inflation targeting regime?<p><i>> How much of this can be attributed to natural technological progress</i><p>Almost all of it, but technological progress cannot happen without a stable economy. People don't build factories unless they believe they can realise a steady income.<p><i>> And what percentage of the excess wealth (compared to an undriven economy) has been actually used to raise people out of poverty?</i><p>We do <i>not</i> live in a driven economy. We live in an economy where the value of money is kept stable in order to counteract the economy's natural tendency towards boom and bust. What do you mean when you say the economy is 'driven'? Give an actual economic definition of this term.<p><i>> It's not sustainable progress to get the masses out of poverty if you've used up most of the natural resources in the process.</i><p>Sustainability is entirely orthogonal to monetary policy. Neither have any affect on each other,<p><i>> The person who borrowed is the second recipient, the bank takes the first cut through fees and increased interest</i><p>No, they are the first recipient. Why do you say they are the second? They get the money first, therefore they are the first recipient. The bank gets interest, but interest accrues after the loan has been made. Your claim makes no sense.<p><i>> The government gets to tap into the supply through perpetual deficit spending.</i><p>So once again, it appears that the <i>borrowers</i> are the first recipient!<p>Your last part shows you don't understand the economic laws of nominal pricing. There's no point me discussing this, as you could go and look up the theory yourself.<p><i>> why do they violently shut down competition?</i><p>They don't. Very few countries have laws restricting what currency you can use. Many people have created alternative currency systems. But very few people use them precisely because national currencies win in the market.",1232797217

448021,comment,447503,447503,0,0,thwarted,,,"""Still, it can be worth it because there are a few mitigating factors. For one, their interest and yours are usually at least somewhat aligned. Facebookâ€™s success is in no small part due to their platform.""<p>I'm not sure that I'd put Facebook and Twitter (the reason the original post that Matt is responding to was written) in the same group when it comes to figuring out which star to hitch your wagon to.  I agree, you can be reasonably confident of your assessment of Facebook's goals and success being aligned with yours.  Facebook is also large enough that any one developer or group of developers are an extremely minor nuisance to them, in terms of the size of their total user base and the kinds of things they need to deal with on a day to day basis.  As Facebook grows their user base, your app can grow.  Twitter has a history of user base growth that correlates with an increase in performance problems (either downtime or seemingly arbitrary limits, aka bad scalability); does Facebook?  Twitter has a lot of users, but it's barely comparable to the size of Facebook.  With Facebook, you are also more dependent on their platform, integrated extremely close to it.  With Twitter, your app runs on your own domain because twitter doesn't provide any significant kind of UI integration -- because of this, twitter the platform is more at risk of _losing_ users (as they visit other domains) because of your app.  In order to use Facebook apps, you have to be on Facebook.  Additionally, most third-party twitter apps are _extensions_ of twitter, that make up for lack of features or otherwise serious deficiencies of twitter (this is especially the case because twitter has a record of _removing_ features as their method of dealing with scaling).<p>Facebook is much closer to being a company and service that provides infrastructure, even though the actual things that you can build on that infrastructure are relatively limited (due to things like their TOS and privacy policy).  Facebook seems to have a vested interest in ensuring that your third-party service continues to work on their platform, because _your_ app potentially keeps people coming to the site.  This is not necessarily the case with twitter.  You can't tell what twitter is going to change that limits you and your project in terms of growth or success.  Facebook seems to make decisions in the context of what their users want (especially after beacon), twitter seems to be shooting in the dark.<p>And everything I've said above about Facebook applies equally well to the iPhone.  Facebook and the iPhone become more popular when people create and use third-party extensions.  Third-party extensions seem to threaten twitter.  And a threatened entity is one that strikes with force, not one that nurtures.<p>Really the message is
   * be cautious when deciding which platforms to use
   * don't try to do everything yourself, but don't be entirely dependent either
   * Diversify, man can not surive on one platform alone; this also increases your reach
   * Be aware of the non-technical influences on the platform's continued success and existence",1232797124

448013,comment,447951,447951,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Honestly this might not be a popular opinion but if Iâ€™m being honest I have to say the ""revolution bloggers tried to start"" was always a croc.  It dismissed the fact that big news sources got where they were for a reason.  That reason was that they were, at least at one time, the best at delivering information that people want.<p>Thatâ€™s how the world works.  You donâ€™t have people checking 1,000 blogs for their news.  Eventually a few of those 1,000 establish themselves as the best and they become the center of things.<p>Now there is a natural turn over where big sites stop being the best source for news and new sites take their place.  In that process blogging did make a difference by lowering the barrier to entry.  Michael Arrington started out as one guy reporting on what he found interesting and became the ""blog of record"" which would never have been possible in old media.<p>But that doesnâ€™t change the fact that there will always be a hierarchy and every hierarchy needs someone  at the top.",1232795788
448012,comment,447166,447887,0,0,tdavis,,,"Erm, that's my opposite opinion, I guess. My (attempted) argument is that one should not write their own framework unless doing so as an exercise in learning. In any other case, using existing frameworks or using the ""roll your own library mix tape"" strategy is far more efficient.<p>Basically, I'm saying if you're using a language which has mature frameworks and/or mature libraries which could be forged into an ad-hoc framework (templating, serving, ORM, etc.) it is terrible advise to tell people ""just write your own"".<p>Only in the case that you've considered all existing (relevant) options and determined none of them meet your use case (and none can be minimally altered to do so) should you consider writing your own.

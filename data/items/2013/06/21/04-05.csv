5916613,comment,5916451,5916537,3,0,zalew,,,"Depends how you look at it. In hi-tech Japan low-level dull jobs are encouraged because they prefer that to unemployment. Thus there are 3 people servicing your car on the gas station (I only read about it, not sure if still true), every one of them has healthcare, etc. Nation-wide, in the long run supporting such jobs may be cheaper than dealing with the side-effects of unemployment.<p>As a different example, in GCC countries immigrants also tank your car, but there it&#x27;s just cheap means of comfort.",1371790795

The reason that I usually compare Firefox and Chrome and not others is basically because Firefox and Chrome are easy to test. It&#x27;s very simple to get the shell versions of the two browsers&#x27; JS engines, build them, and run them, and benchmarking in the shell is much simpler than otherwise. In contrast:<p>* Internet Explorer is Windows-only. I run Linux. There are some free VMs now, but you can&#x27;t benchmark in a VM, it would be unfair. Also, even on Windows, I am not sure if Chakra has a shell version (does it?)<p>* Safari is OS X only (and again, I run Linux). JSC, its JS engine, has a shell version. This would be great, but the only way to build it on Linux is apparently to build the Qt-WebKit port of WebKit (whereas apparently on OS X it is very simple). I&#x27;ve tried a few times to follow guides on how to do that, and it always fails somewhere in their dependencies. Not sure if the guides are wrong or if something in my distro&#x27;s Qt deps is not a proper match. A few projects do embed JSC, and are easy to build on Linux, but the snapshots are dated - to benchmark I really want the very latest code, or else it would be unfair to JSC. (Btw, if there is a simpler way to build JSC on Linux, I would really like to know!)<p>I do sometimes benchmark those two, but it means finding a machine I can borrow for that purpose, which takes time, so it is rare.<p>(And I don&#x27;t benchmark Opera because they are moving to V8, which I already benchmark anyhow.)",1371789219

Think Agda, Coq, Idris-style languages if you&#x27;re familiar with them... otherwise think GADTs on supersteroids gone berserk.<p>Dependent types allow you to be extremely precise with your data types. You can talk about not just lists or lists of strings.... but also lists of strings of length n (for some natural number n). In the far future, it may be the key to getting fast-as-C performance (think removing bounds checking on arrays completely safely) and software verified correctness of a program simultaneously.<p>This isn&#x27;t software, though. This is a math book.\nThere was a realization a few years ago that equality types (the ability to express x = y in the type system) gave rise to a mathematical structure called a weak ω-groupoid which was giving homotopy and category theorists a hard time. Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) is a typed lambda calculus that makes studying these things easier. In fact, every data type corresponds to (a very boring) weak ω-groupoid.<p>What this allows mathematicians to do, though, is to create new interesting data types corresponding to more interesting examples of these things. You get a data type for a Circle, or a Sphere, or a Torus. You can define functions between them via recursion the same way you&#x27;d define a function on lists or trees. These new fancy data types are called higher inductive types, and while they don&#x27;t (currently) have any use for programmers, they pay the meager salaries of long beards in the ivory tower.<p>The other novelty of the theory might be more interesting for programmers some day (at least if you believe dependent types will save the world).<p>A guy named Voevodsky proposed a new axiom called the Univalence Axiom that makes HoTT a substatial alternative to the former foundations of mathematics. The Univalence Axiom formalizes a practice mathematicans had been using for a long time, (despite its technical incompatibility with ZFC). tl;dr, the Univalence Axiom says that if two data types are isomorphic then they are equal.<p>Eventually, this axiom may allow a programmer to do some neat things. For instance, a programmer could write two versions of a program -- a naive version and a &quot;fast&quot; version. (Currently, all programmers only write the &quot;fast&quot; version). If you want to formally prove your &quot;fast&quot; program doesn&#x27;t suck, it&#x27;s nasty. However, it might even be humanly possible to prove some correctness about the naive version. The Univalence Axiom (once given &quot;computational semantics&quot;) may be able to let us prove things about the dumb, slow, reference implementation of a program or library, then transfer that proof of correctness to the fast one.<p>To give a small example for anyone familiar with a dependently-typed language, you may notice that in Coq and Agda and whatever, the first data type you learn (and one you stick with for a long time) are the unary natural numbers. That is, you have 0, and 0+1, and 0+1+1, and 0+1+1+1, etc.. We use unary numbers because they are reaaaally easy to prove stuff about. But as any programmer might guess, actually doing anything with them is suicide. The Univalence Axiom would allow us to keep on working with unary numbers for all of our proofs, but then swap them out for actual, honest-to-God 2&#x27;s complement representations when it comes time to run the program.<p>So there&#x27;s that.<p>Not everyone cares about software correctness, though. But if you&#x27;re sold on category theory, here&#x27;s a neat trick. You probably know that equality becomes a hairy, nasty thing in category theory. Two objects can be equal or isomorphic. If you move onto 2-categories, two categories can be equal, isomorphic, or equivalent! And for higher category theory, you end up with even more notions of equaltiy, isomorphism, equivalence, etc, etc.<p>In a univalent foundation of category theory (which appears in the later chapters of this book), we see that all of these notions of equality collapse down into just one. If two things are isomorphic, then they are, by definition, equal to each other. You no longer have to worry about that stupid squiggle over your equals signs, because univalence means that every construction must respect the structure of your data. There are no leaky abstractions in your data types!&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gr3uw/the_homotopy_type_theory_book_is_now_available/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gr3uw/the_homotopy...</a>",1371789140

There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that agriculture runoff is the biggest contributor. Unfortunately removing agriculture subsidies won&#x27;t fix the problem.<p>A number of people in the Chesapeake basin point the finger at chicken and pig farms in the region due to their controversial use of manure lagoons [1]. To the best of my knowledge these industries aren&#x27;t heavily subsidized like corn and soy.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole issue of baselining. What&#x27;s normal for the Mississippi river outflow? We&#x27;ve been observing the impacts to the fisheries there and the Chesapeake for hundreds of years, but we&#x27;ve only been measuring DO for a few decades and DO is far from the only thing that impacts fisheries. Further, the Mississippi dumps a ton of relatively still water that&#x27;s full of tannins directly into the relatively still and warm gulf. I&#x27;m nowhere near qualified to say this conclusively, but I&#x27;d bet there have been yearly cycles of hypoxia there for millennia. Does this multiply or dampen our impacts?<p>This is a crazy complex multi-headed monster that looks completely different in every region it inhabits. For every one of these massive hypoxic regions there&#x27;s a ton of other smaller ones. Next time you&#x27;re bored take a look at the waterways in your area on Google maps, especially where small local canals or drainage ditches empty into larger bodies of water. Then go look at the topography of the area and try to back-of-the-envelope account for what all is pouring out of there. Then go do that for a completely different region. The diversity if nutrient inputs is insane.<p>The only reliable long-term way I can see to fix the problem is to get people to understand the impacts of their actions, and to associate those impacts with the things that they buy, consume, and produce. When you flush the toilet your poop goes somewhere. The same is true with your lawn clippings, farm waste, fertilizers, antibiotics, birth control, etc.<p>1: <a href=""http://nc.water.usgs.gov/flood/floods99/photos/IMG003.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nc.water.usgs.gov/flood/floods99/photos/IMG003.html</a>",1371787443

1290615,comment,1286391,1288614,0,0,GHFigs,,,"I love how you ignore every single relevant detail here in favor of an interpretation that doesn't fit anything but your existing biases. I love consistency like that, it's amazing.<p><i>What is an ""actual customer""?</i><p>Someone who is going to actually use the product they are buying from you, as opposed to someone whose sole intent is to capitalize on your product's scarcity. The end consumer, as opposed to the middle-man.<p><i>they are a pretty fucking excellent customer.</i><p>And what about the next guy in line? The ""actual customer"" as above, who doesn't get your product because you're too busy selling it to the guy who's only interested in making it even more scarce. Like I said before, you make the same amount of money from the sale, but if you can afford to be choosy about your customers (and in this situation, Apple can), the ""actual customer"" is the one you want to favor. The retailer has no incentive to favor the middle-man, who <i>at best</i> is going to raise the price to the end consumer without earning you a cent.<p><i>If you're worried about a secondary market, make more of your thing.</i><p>In what bizarro world does this happen instantaneously?",1272099203

1290608,comment,1290197,1290262,0,0,scorchin,,,"Definitely this!<p>I'm passionate about becoming a great hacker and I'm regularly trying to improve my skills in both hardware and software hacking (20/80 split at the moment).<p>My main issue is that I require a lot of structure in terms of the way that I learn, to deal with this I've borrowed ""Programming Interview Explained"" [ <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Landing/dp/0471383562"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets...</a> ]  from a friend. It's a fairly short book but outlines what knowledge would be requisite for getting a job at Microsoft back in the early 2000s.<p>I'm going through the book and finding out what knowledge areas are currently lacking and supplementing them with books which are considered to be good for that specific subset of computing. E.g. I found out I was terrible at bit manipulation, so I've bought ""Hacker's Delight"" [ <a href=""http://www.hackersdelight.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackersdelight.org/</a> ], which is helping in both my software knowledge and hardware knowledge.<p>I figure that this method of learning will likely take me over a year if I limit the supplementing books to just 1 or 2 at most. After that I can go through it again, covering all of the topics that I thought I knew well enough to make sure my knowledge is all up to scratch.<p>TL;DR Persistance is key if you want to gain domain knowledge in your field. I'm taking a backwards approach and using a book to define my learning path.",1272098732

1290600,comment,1283938,1283938,0,0,korch,,,"I think open graph is going to be a bitter poison pill for Facebook, and once they see what users actually do with it they will have no choice but to cripple it. Though I'm glad to finally see Brad Fitzpatrick's open graph idea from years ago on Livejournal come to fruition.<p>Tucked away in the announcements was a policy change to allow 3rd parties to now store Facebook user data for more than 24 hours. Facebook now wants every web site to embed their widgets, so to do that, they have to make their data freely available. Facebook might be a far better walled garden than AOL ever was, a truly wondrous Hanging Gardens of Babylon; but open graph turns them inside out.<p>Now what's to stop the rest of the web from just looting all of Facebook's data?<p>Some will argue that this is a similar pattern to being indexed by Google—trying to lock down content backfires, because if you give it away, the traffic Google brings you more than makes up for whatever you lost. So too for Facebook—they get more traffic back by giving away data compared to forcing everyone to facebook.com.<p>Everybody knows Facebook will become the next Myspace(Friendster, yadda, yadda), even if nobody knows quite how it's going to happen. (Kind of like how everybody knew the housing market was in a bubble, yet kept playing it up.) Blowing open the gates on data sharing is going to hurt Facebook more in the long term, because it opens up new opportunities to leverage user data across the whole web ecosystem in ways which Facebook cannot control. It's inevitable that someone is going to build a popular service on top of Facebook's user data; structued in such a way that Facebook itself couldn't clone it internally without compromising their other products and partners. While this itself is great for users and the whole web, it's not going to be so great for Facebook.",1272098116

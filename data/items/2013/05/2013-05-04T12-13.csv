5654901,comment,5653650,5654839,6,0,klibertp,,,"I will omit language war you both (parent and grandparent) seem to like waging and I'll go straight to the point.<p>Which is that OO based on prototypes is strictly more powerful than popular class based ones. Which is proven by the very fact you mention: people are writing class-based OO implementations in JavaScript with easy, one can create such an implementation in under 100 LOC. So if you think that ""superiority"" is determined by expressive power, then (popular) class based OO sucks balls in this comparison :)<p>I'm including the 'popular' qualification because thinking about class based object orientation in terms of C++ and Java is rather limited. If take a look at Smalltalk you'll see wonders like #become:. Ruby has implemented substantial subset of what Smalltalk provides and Python, although through really ugly hacks, is still able to replicate prototype-ness of JS.<p>This hints us to the real problem I think you missed, I mean age old difference between static and dynamic typing. Things like Google's Closure Compiler seem to suggest that static typing is desirable in the large projects. And while JITing can alleviate most of the performance problems, maintenance still remains to be a pain in the ass. This same thing applies to class and prototype based OO - while more expressive for the most part, prototypes are not as maintenance friendly as classes are. All sorts of tools, when working with classes, can provide you autocompletion, for example - it's much, much harder with prototypes, which can change at any moment.<p>So, to summarize, I think you blame the right thing but for incorrect reason. Prototype based OO is ""better"" than class based in terms of expressiveness, but ""worse"" in terms of maintenance (for now at least). As everything, both techniques have a place in programming and it's just stupid to bash one or the other.",1367672330

Compare that with a post WW2 era where former colonies throughout the world became independent states simply through ""self determination"" and democratic elections.  The double standard is again attributable to change in international norms, again this creates a problem because the international community does not want to codify their own position that they are unwilling to recognize a democratically elected government.<p>>Who are we in other courtries to say what's wrong?<p>""We"" should not be referring to individuals with opinions but the international community and I think most would argue the international community has a duty to create international law, norms and customs or in your words say what is wrong behavior.",1367672211

5654867,comment,5653515,5653731,2,0,Gravityloss,,,"This is wrong for a multitude of reasons.<p>1. Rocket engines have high thrust to weight ratio, typically around 100. Jets can have about 10. Scramjets can be really bad.<p>2. You can speed up quite quickly since the atmosphere is there for the first 30 km or so only.<p>3. White Knight Two that launches Spaceshiptwo is subsonic, not supersonic. The air launch is beneficial roughly:<p>- primarily because your rocket engine's expansion ratio can be bigger and you get more thrust for same fuel flow<p>- secondarily because then you can launch flexibly by flying to a location, that for example has less population or air traffic or is easy to launch to the right orbit from<p>- thirdly because you can always glide to a landing if something goes wrong with the engine. With a vertical takeoff there's a time right after takeoff where it's hard to do an engine out abort with something like a parachute.<p>Note all the above advantages are <i>not</i> dependent on carrier aircraft speed. In fact supersonic separation is a hard problem, never mind something at Mach 3. (See D-21)<p>If you look at something like dry mass, rockets will practically always win over air breathers in studies because of the lightness and simplicity of simple tanks and high thrust to weight ratio of rocket engines.<p>This whole scramjet affair is very misguided if you're trying to save something like liquid oxygen which is extremely cheap. Even when it weighs something, it doesn't matter since tanks are light and simple and (did I mention already:) rocket engines have high thrust to weight ratio.<p>I'll choose that any day over a huge scramjet inlet that needs to adjust to variable speeds by having big movable ramps, a big burner and a big exhaust, all experiencing large aerodynamic heating problems, multiple load paths (a rocket has basically only vertical loads).",1367671288

Due to these failings, we see many, many developers resort to implementing some limited subset or variant of class-based OO using the functionality that JavaScript does offer. The fact that we see this going on time and time again, involving many different developers, all across the world, over the course of many years should tell us something. I think that ""something"" is that class-based OO is inherently superior to prototype-based OO for the types of problems typically encountered when developing practical software.<p>Besides, C is the widest-deployed platform in the world. Add in C++, and their share of the market is absolutely huge. Basically every JavaScript implementation today is implemented using one or both of them. The major browsers embedding those JavaScript implementations are implemented in one or both. The operating systems the browsers are running on are implemented in one or both. The servers they're accessing are running operating systems, web servers, database servers, programming language implementations and applications written in C and/or C++. All of this is linked together using various networking devices running code written in C or C++. So every single line of JavaScript code that's executed depends on a stunningly huge amount of C and C++ code also being executed.",1367670516

And the features that are being asked for by users commenting on the OP are ones already provided by the existing standard.<p>And what about querying the data? There have already been questions elsewhere in this thread about how this would work. OData already provides very rich query support, including document projection (returning a subset of a document) through to complex queries navigating multiple relationships (I easily could ask, through a GET query string, to return all the actors who have starred in films that belong to the comedy genre - navigating 3 collections, actors,films,genres). If queries are out of the scope, then fine, but its clear people want to query their data.<p>So please answer what this offers over existing standards if you want to compete.<p>Oh, and in response to your earlier post of what OData JSON looks like, you're much better served by linking to v4, not v2 as you did:<p><a href=""http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.0/csprd01/odata-json-format-v4.0-csprd01.html#_Toc355172930"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.0/cspr...</a><p>That doesn't look so dissimilar.",1367670502

It was done by a group inside goonswarm federation which is the something awful forums in game guild. They are one of the largest and most organized groups in the game and the regularly do stupid shit that tries to break the game. The figured this out almost immediately and racked up enough in game currency that they controlled a sizable portion of the liquid assets in the game. enough that they would be able to bank roll their in game operations for years without worry. This is when they finally publicly revealed what they were doing and the game devs had to step and tell them they could not keep the money. They devs did not figure out what was going on until the guys doing the exploit publicly described how they were doing it on the game forums.<p>Other shit goonswarm is known for doing is destroying ships in the games safe zones. The game mechanic is that in the safe zones there is NPC police that will kill anyone who attacks another player without consent. But the catch is that the NPC police have a response time that can be gamed. The response time is only a few seconds but a well coordinated attack can destroy a ship within that time. The attacking player still gets killed by the NPC police but they accomplish their suicide kill anyway. The goonswarm offers rewards to players to make it worthwhile to do these suicide attacks on players who sit in the safe zones and just mine resources in expensive ships. Making the safe zones no longer safe. They do this just because they can and they want to watch everything burn.",1367670404

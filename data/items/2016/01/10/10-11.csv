Investors are patient, knowing that Pinterest will start printing money when the time is right. But right now, Pinterest is still building the userbase and perfecting their ad platform. Like Facebook, Pinterest&#x27;s profit margins will be extremely high, and it would not surprise me if this company is worth $50 billion soon.

We use the Optimizely results screen for general steer, but do final analysis in either Google Analytics or our own databases. Sometimes tests can positively affect the primary metric but negatively affect another.<p>3) Get qualitative feedback either before or during the test.

They all have minimalist and full featured frameworks for building applications including but not limited to Express, Koa, Ruby On Rails, Sinatra, Django, Flask. Go is also fairly easy to get going quickly in. There is not really a wrong choice here for a personal project.<p>In the case that you want a single page application that works with the backend you made with the previous choices:<p>Backbone or Angular or React+Redux(any flux implementation will do)<p>These are for consuming your backend and any of them will do. Learning Angular is its own thing despite it being javascript. React+Redux seems a little odd by embedding html in your javascript but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s pretty neat.

Many of those will necessarily fail as people don&#x27;t have sufficient funds to leave the station they are in. This is a failure mode the NYC subway simply doesn&#x27;t have now, all people in the system are free to leave any any time through any available low-tech door.<p>The idea of several hundred thousand people trying to get out through (presumably newly installed) turnstiles at grand central during rush hour while random people in front of me stall out and get trapped because their cards have insufficient funds doesn&#x27;t sound fun at all. How about a tour group getting off in a very constricted station in lower Manhattan and having 90 people trapped unable to leave the platform and no room for passengers to enter? What about stations where you can&#x27;t reverse direction without leaving the station, how do you head to a station you can afford to exit?<p>Sure in the long run anything is possible, but I don&#x27;t think people who advocate for a zone system in NYC have usually thought about the actual human scale logistics required for that to work.

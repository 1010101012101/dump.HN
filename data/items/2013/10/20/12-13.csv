Escaping from Reality by relying on external input feeds and output sinks only passively engages the Imagination and does not produce the same internal Imagination-Reality-Manifestation loop.<p>As with most things, a healthy balance of both internal and external escapism is probably the best. Calvin and Hobbes explains this the best.",1382273994

The protagonist does three good deeds and asks the beneficiaries to do three good deeds and so on.</i><p>The origins of this term are somewhat different, and worth noting. The normal mode of reciporocity is to &#x27;pay it back&#x27;. However, there are certain times when this would be physically impossible. This is the origin of &#x27;pay it forward&#x27;. It results from the <i>humble</i> notion: I can never pay it <i>back</i>, so I will pay it <i>forward</i>. It has nothing to do with scaling (3x), nor contingency (i did this for you, now you do this...etc). It is a response to an actual act of kindness or generosity that precisely lacks such a contingency (most usually because you will never interact with the person that helped you out, ever again). It would have been nice for the NY Times piece to note this correctly! Its just too bad that the actual understanding of the term could not be promulgated through what is otherwise a good piece (likely to be widely read).",1382273596

So the percentage of people behaving like freeters / neets probably is somewhat larger than the demographic percentage of freeter/neets.<p>Well, no girl my age would ever have anything to do with me because I&#x27;m poor and have no future, so, uh, yeah I&#x27;m not looking thats the story I&#x27;ll tell so I feel a little better.  Pout and quit is hardly unknown in the west &quot;Oh so you guys are cheating and stacking the game against me, well F you I&#x27;m taking my (two) balls and going home&quot;.

Well, until the inevitable revolution, you&#x27;ll get weird things like young people not having sex.<p>Finally the whole topic is super hetro-normative so I think we can all safely assume at least 5% or so are in the closet.<p>So 5% in closet, in 2000, in better times, 10% were NEETs per govt figures, in better times 30% were freeters (some of whom do get some...) maybe 10% of salarymen (or more precisely, the girls checking them out) accurately or inaccurately believe they&#x27;re one unlucky event away from permanent downgrade into freeter/neet (is there significant upward mobility in Japan from freeter/neet?  Not that I&#x27;ve read/heard?)  So that&#x27;s 55% right there although some of the freeters ARE probably getting some.  Of course not everyone reacts to being screwed over by withdrawing; in the US they sometimes go out shooting, etc.  Fixing the withdrawl problem without fixing the economic stressors is likely just to result in different negative social reactions WRT weapons etc.",1382273238

The author cites data and surveys, which clearly show the problem.<p>&quot;Japan already has one of the world&#x27;s lowest birth rates. Its population of 126 million, which has been shrinking for the past decade, is projected to plunge a further one-third by 2060.&quot;<p>&quot;The number of single people has reached a record high. A survey in 2011 found that 61% of unmarried men and 49% of women aged 18-34 were not in any kind of romantic relationship, a rise of almost 10% from five years earlier. Another study found that a third of people under 30 had never dated at all.&quot;<p>&quot;A survey earlier this year by the Japan Family Planning Association (JFPA) found that 45% of women aged 16-24 &quot;were not interested in or despised sexual contact&quot;.

But I do have to disagree with your affection for awk and sed even though in the past I have used them both extensively.<p>The advantage of learning perl is that you can replace both utilities in your piped command line and only have to remember one syntax.  And it integrates just as well as sed and awk do in any pipeline.  But quite often, it will obviate the need for piping through other utilities.<p>Perl is much closer to sed and awk than any of the other scripting languages you mention.  As noted in other posts, you can even automatically convert awk scripts to perl.  And it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to convert sed scripts to perl where you can leverage more powerful pattern matching and procedural facilities to boot.<p>If you already know sed and awk, by all means keep using them, they&#x27;re fine.

6579715,comment,6550068,6552954,2,0,nunb,,,"Actually it seems to be your assumptions that need questioning: the\nidea of &quot;conflating all saving&quot; is itself wrong.<p>Saving is a matter of time preference, specifically, preferring to\nconsume in the future. That implies carrying forward surplus value\nfrom today to be spent tomorrow. It matters not whether you stash gold\nin a mattress of buy stock of Webvan: you merely hope to have X+delta\nat T+t time where {X, T} represent the present and {d,t} represent\nincrements and can be zero.<p>In order for you to then invest your gold in Webvan, said company has\nto offer you a higher rate of return than merely holding the gold.<p>Gold will increase in value if more produce is offered in exchange\nat time T+t; assuming stock of gold is constant (which it is, to an\napproximation). Of course, I prefer the word price since gold has\nno intrinsic value.<p>So what Webvan has to offer you (a sane investor) is a better return\nthan the rest of the aggregate efforts of human-kind, assuming of\ncourse, that said aggregate efforts are barter-able with gold (that\nis, can be bought with gold).<p>This is <i>precisely</i> what makes unbridled capitalism and free-floating\ninterest rates so wonderfully efficient. That damn company cannot get\naway with peddling something that doesn&#x27;t improve all our lives. It\nhas a high return on investment barrier to <i>cross</i> in a hard-money\neconomy (defined in this case as a fixed supply of gold).<p>Conversely, when Greenspan is pumping money, it&#x27;s pets.com&#x27;s time to\nshine! And of course, what most don&#x27;t seem to realize is that the\ncurrent crop of startups is mostly just Bernanke&#x27;s easy money that\nneeds a place to park itself. That&#x27;s why VCs just can&#x27;t get enough\nflow and bitch about deal-sizes.<p>Another way to phrase the &#x27;investment barrier&#x27; is to say that the\nratio between spending preferences now and in the future determines\nthe interest rate. A high interest rate implies only higher-credit\n(in the sense of faith in their success) companies will get money. The\nhighly &#x27;speculative investment&#x27; in pet-dating will simply not happen.\nNote again, I don&#x27;t like the word investment, savings is just fine as\na word for deferment of consumption, and speculation itself is not bad.\nHere &#x27;speculative investment&#x27; is a synonym for unproductive stupid shit\nmoney&#x27;s being spent on.<p>Nor will houses be given to bad-credit home-buyers, incidentally, which\n<i>really</i> troubles some. But ask yourself -- if Bob-the-builder built a house and the\nhome-buyer promised him ten apples, and couldn&#x27;t pay him dem apples,\nwould Bob in hindsight have wanted to build that house for him? If he\ndefaults on Bob, Bob is impoverished. If the Fed bails him out (or\nactually bails the home-builder out) all of us are impoverished\n(currently above 50K USD per person in the USA approx). Charity is\nfine, forced-labor is not.<p>In your (and Krugman&#x27;s, and most of mainstream (read tenured)\neconomics&#x27;) conception, the idea that stashing gold is not productive\nis merely another way of saying &quot;gold stashers don&#x27;t fund Webvan&quot; when\nlooked at through this lens.<p>Damn well they don&#x27;t! Everybody should have the right to sit on the\nside-lines and watch. It is almost Gandhian in its non-participation\n(excepting grand-nieces, but that&#x27;s another story).<p>That is precisely what stashing your savings under the mattress in a\nhard-money economy does, allows you to step away from the pets.com\nfrenzy.<p>Wall Street has another way to say it: While the music&#x27;s playing, you&#x27;ve\ngotta get up and dance. If a bank didn&#x27;t take the bail-outs it would\nhave gotten bought out, lock, stock & barrel by one that did. While\nBen&#x27;s fiddling, you&#x27;ve got to join the orgy. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the\ncountry burns in the meanwhile.<p>So the problem with this inflationary money supply is simply that it\ndistorts interest rates, thereby funding <i>unproductive</i>\nenterprises. The Webvan&#x27;s get funded, Facebook & Twitter IPO, and we\nwring our hands and say: hey why aren&#x27;t we flying to Mars, or curing\nmalaria? Why are our best and brightest kids tweaking ad algorithms\nfor Google and writing stupid Miley Cyrus hash-tag trend-divining programs?<p>This is why.<p>In periods of hard-money we saw great advancements in the standard of\nliving of peoples around the world[correlation?]. The free market\nalways beats a planned economy. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the planning is\novert like the Soviet model or merely a &#x27;plan&#x27; to distort time\npreferences. From 1600 to 1900, perhaps we didn&#x27;t have a vast increase\nin leisure, but damn, we got productive things done first. Now if you\nreally think a John Deere on every lawn, and immediate notification of\nthe latest Miley Cyrus nipslip is so important, sit back and enjoy the\nend of empire, because it&#x27;s going to happen anyway.<p>When the system collapses, the only ones ahead will be those who&#x27;ve\nmoved into &quot;real value&quot; in the Misesian sense. That&#x27;s why the Wall St\ntypes are buying 20mn$ condos in NY and chateaux in the south of\nFrance -- they know something you don&#x27;t. Compared to what they get\npaid (in newly created funny-money) those condos are at a damn\ndiscount. And eating cake in France while the peasants can barely\nafford bread in Austerity-USA? Well, that&#x27;s sweet too.<p>Information is power, and those with it don&#x27;t want you to have\nit. Therefore you will always get misinformation first. Don&#x27;t believe\nthe propaganda. Read and learn (but don&#x27;t read Krugman, the man&#x27;s a colossal\njackass) but mostly, just work through the logic.

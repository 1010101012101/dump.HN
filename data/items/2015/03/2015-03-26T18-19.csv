I think it&#x27;s better suited for my 15 year old self, as I found the historical context of the book more interesting than the philosophy this time around. It also just goes on and on and on -- you get the general premise early on and it feels overly verbose by a factor of 2-3x. The characters don&#x27;t age well either, my older self has found them to be kind of flat and boring.<p>Still, it&#x27;s a good read. Especially the economic mechanics of the universe -- it&#x27;s fascinating to read about the technology, culture, sexism, and politics from the first half of the 20th century. That alone makes it worthwhile.

I&#x27;m not very interested in persuading others that Lisp macros are necessary, and there are many languages I like to use that don&#x27;t have macros. However!<p>Yes, all programming languages are programmable. But Lisp tends to be unlimited in its programmability, in almost the same way that Unix is: if you have root, you can change anything. I&#x27;m pretty sure that in most Common Lisp systems, you can redefine large parts of the compiler at runtime. And so on.<p>Syntactic macros are just one part. They can be extremely handy. Lots of Lisp systems use them well. Random examples: the DEFSYSTEM macro of ASDF; the DEFINE-EASY-HANDLER macro of Hunchentoot (a Common Lisp web server); the (controversial) LOOP and ITERATE macros; etc.<p>Another somewhat random example: Movitz was (is?) a project to write an x86 kernel in Common Lisp. It actually included its own compiler. It defines a lot of macros for instruction definition [0] and uses them in code that I don&#x27;t understand anything of [1] but is probably very clear to someone versed in assembly.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve been trying to add some nice logging to a JavaScript program, and it&#x27;s a typical scenario where the normal syntax is just annoying enough to make the code ugly and hard to scan—if I had macros, I could invent some other syntax.<p>How to use macros is a tradeoff that I guess comes with Lisp experience, but they can be a powerful escape when the standard syntax is annoying, and a way to define your own DSLs without restriction.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://common-lisp.net/viewvc/movitz/ia-x86/def-instr.lisp?view=markup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://common-lisp.net/viewvc/movitz/ia-x86/def-instr.lisp?...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://common-lisp.net/viewvc/movitz/ia-x86/instr-add.lisp?revision=1.3&view=markup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://common-lisp.net/viewvc/movitz/ia-x86/instr-add.lisp?...</a>",1427395899

If I want more download, I have to pay more.  I don&#x27;t get free, unlimited &quot;as much as I want&quot; downloads, and only pay for the uploads, right?  So for a consumer ISP, the principle is &quot;receiver pays&quot;<p>For a commercial, content producers, the model is &quot;sender pays&quot; which makes sense.  That&#x27;s why hosting companies buy transit from Level3, Cogent, etc.  They&#x27;re paying to send.<p>What&#x27;s happened is that Netflix has already paid to send, and ISP customers have already paid to receive, and ISPs have said &quot;yeah that&#x27;s fine, but if you REALLY want to send, you&#x27;re going to have to pay AGAIN&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the sticking point.<p>Nobody&#x27;s arguing that anyone should get a free ability to send, or a free ability to receive.  All traffic is generally double billed, once for the sender&#x27;s connection and once for the receiver&#x27;s connection.<p>The &quot;innovation&quot; here is that some ISPs have decided that SOME traffic should be TRIPLE billed.  Once at the sender, once at the receiver, and a third time when it crosses from the sender&#x27;s network to the receiver&#x27;s network.<p>Why, if triple billing is OK, should only the consumer ISPs be allowed to do it?  Why doesn&#x27;t Cogent or Level3 charge consumer ISPs extra for receiving more than they&#x27;re sending?  Under the consumer ISPs model of &quot;receiver pays&quot; it would be entirely reasonable for Cogent or Level3 to charge extra, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>You&#x27;re basically arguing that the way consumer ISPs handle this is acceptable.  OK.  Why isn&#x27;t the exact opposite also acceptable?  It&#x27;s not as though most consumer ISPs have a global transit network!  They&#x27;re the ones that desperately need more download than upload to satisfy their highly asymmetrically provisioned customer connections, right?<p>Ultimately the problem here is that there are several analytical frameworks that one can use to decide who is the asshole here and who is the saint.<p>Given that I&#x27;m held captive by my consumer ISP and have a fair amount of choice over what content I subscribe to, I&#x27;m more inclined to believe that the consumer ISPs are abusing their power over the content providers.  I don&#x27;t have pleasant interactions with them basically ever so I can&#x27;t see why I would extend them the benefit of the doubt.",1427395807

Regulations are okay as long as they are easy to follow and simple to understand, and as long as they aren&#x27;t over the top ideologically-driven stop-everything sorts of things. Keep fear mongers, authoritarians, and ideologues away from the regulatory pen.<p><i>Complexity</i> is death. Regulations that categorically stop you from acting are death. Things that encumber agility are death. Anything that saps your time is death, since time is often worth more than money. As a founder I&#x27;d rather pay more in taxes on profit as long as the government stays the F out of the way of my time and my executive decisions.<p>The ideal setup for maximum entrepreneurship would probably be some kind of libertarian socialism: moderate and moderately progressive taxation, health coverage, guaranteed minimum income or negative income tax, and a simple regulatory structure that makes it easy to form new ventures, hire and fire, etc. Other than that the governments gets out of the way and lets people try new things.<p>One caveat on progressive income taxes: they should not be <i>too</i> progressive and there probably should be lower taxes on capital gains.

The privacy implications of storing this data (csmith).  Then, when it would be justified to access it if it IS stored for some reason, for what crimes, and how long it would last to address privacy concerns (iak8god).  Then I chimed in with some reasoning as to why a somewhat longer retention period might be warranted, and <i>why</i>.  Is it unclear there somewhere exactly what we&#x27;re discussing?<p>> The police understand how this technology can help them do that. You say 30 days will help solve more crime than 24 hours. Well, they&#x27;ll say &quot;forever&quot; will solve even more crime than 30 days. End of discussion?<p>Since when is a discussion about one side saying what they want and then it&#x27;s over?  In an effort to solve more crimes, the police would undoubtedly want a lot of access to data that is kept for a long time.  But the other side, the public whose information this is gets a say as well.  I, for my part, would argue that <i>if this information is even allowed to be gathered</i>, that if police want access to it there should be strict controls and conditions.<p>> There has to be a reason we would make it harder for police to do their jobs. What is that reason? To me, that&#x27;s the hard question, but a lot of people here on HN seem to take it for granted that there is an answer.<p>There <i>is</i> an answer, or more accurately, <i>many answers</i>.  Civil liberties, preventing corruption, privacy, etc.  There&#x27;s a reason police can&#x27;t detain you indefinitely without charges, why they can&#x27;t enter your home without cause, why they can&#x27;t seize your property without cause (and of course, there are exceptions to these which people take offense to, often rightly).  Those all make the job of the police harder, but we&#x27;ve tried to strike a balance.  It shifts back and forth over time.<p>> If the subject is &quot;preventing crime,&quot; the privacy argument is already lost. So what is the counterbalance?<p>What, so we don&#x27;t talk about it?  It&#x27;s not okay to have the conversation because you think the other argument isn&#x27;t obvious enough?

In reality, distributed storage and sync is quite a challenging engineering problem, which Dropbox has about a 10 year jump on solving. There is a notorious surfeit of brilliant engineers at Google, but have you actually used Google Drive? I tried it when it came out and it crashed at least once a day.

Put another way, he&#x27;s sitting on the surface of a bubble and pointing out that there&#x27;s not a bubble rising from that surface.<p>He&#x27;s saying that there&#x27;s innovation and the innovation makes these companies more valuable-- on that we can all agree.  Whether VC investments are correctly valuing companies or not at various stages, I don&#x27;t even think that&#x27;s an issue, so I will take his general assertion that they reasonably are.  To the extent that people think that the nature of a the &quot;bubble&quot; is unrealistic valuations, I think it&#x27;s silly to say there&#x27;s a bubble.  That&#x27;s not the bubble.  The actual bubble causes these high valuations but has nothing to do with VC judgement -- who are all acting based on the pricing information they&#x27;re getting from the market-- so that they are being irrational is due to the irrational pricing info they are getting, not due to having lost their senses.  The irrational pricing info is that the cost of money is way too cheap.<p>The bubble is not a startup funding bubble, it&#x27;s a dollar bubble.<p>The main argument for us being in a bubble is not that we&#x27;re in a bubble of VC expectations for companies-- though that is a side argument that VCs expect google and Facebook to buy everything whatever the quality.<p>The main argument is that since 2001 and especially since 2008 the money spigot has been opened wide.  Helicopter Ben is in full effect.  The 2008 bubble was a direct consequence of that spigot being open, combined with interest rates being held below the cost of money and the Clinton era &quot;not loaning money to people who can&#x27;t repay is racist&quot; agenda and changes to the CRA that forced banks to make bad loans.  Everything else that happened in 2002-2007 was secondary effects.<p>When 2008 happened the spigots were opened even wider, the interest rates forced lower ,and now, instead of having an open market for T-bills the federal reserve itself is buying them. Totally distorting the market.<p>The short description of what that means is that money is really cheap-- really cheap for the institutional types that have a lot of it already, and especially really cheap for anyone who can go to the federal reserve window.  EG Banks. T he banks have all this money and have to put it somewhere that earns a return over the borrowing cost (carry)... which from the Fed is even cheaper than the money you lend them in your savings and checking accounts.<p>The way the money spigot works is it filter thru tiers of the economy.  Banks lend as much as they can which produces economic growth (though not without cost, hence the whole misrepresenting this system as Keynesian-- keynes recognized the cost and danger of this, but everyone who claims to be &quot;keynesian&quot; since then and advocates this system seems to ignore the cost and danger.).... and a lot of it hits the stock market and then even more risky ventures.<p>All this money in the VC pockets chasing startups is originating at  the federal reserve as they shove money into the economy.<p>Sam talks about &quot;interest rates rising&quot;.  Well, interest rates would have risen, but the fed is providing unlimited demand for T-bills so that&#x27;s distorting a market signal. The FOMC is providing unlimited money to paper short gold, so that&#x27;s distorting another market signal.<p>I don&#x27;t know how it will break-- just as I wasn&#x27;t sure how the housing crisis would break in 2008, even though I knew there was a bubble (and at that time, by the way, everyone said there wasn&#x27;t a bubble.  They also said there wasn&#x27;t a bubble in 1999.  How old was Sam in 1999? I honestly don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m guessing he was not 18.)<p>And all of this is on top of a hundred years (since the founding of the federal reserve) of exporting the effects of US dollar inflation onto other economies-- most of which were weaker than us but now are reaching parity and don&#x27;t need the dollar to back their currencies so much anymore.<p>The bubble is not a startup funding bubble, it&#x27;s a dollar bubble.<p>I&#x27;m certain we are in one. I have no idea if it will bust in the next 5 years.  But when it does, it will be worse than 2008, 1999 and the 1930s combined.",1427395178

It&#x27;s not the fault of mailinator, nor the fault of banks, is the fault of wanting to have one (trial) account per person.<p>South Korea even takes the extreme approach of requiring social security numbers to guarantee that every account reflects one (korean) person, yet it is trivially easy to find stolen databases of schools and companies, and many forums, especially gaming forums even recommend you to commit identity theft to play an online korean game.<p>Not even companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc. can save themselves from complex abuse techniques like stolen CC&#x27;s, generated and valid CC&#x27;s, disposable CC&#x27;s, etc. You can pretty easily find news about massive DDoS attacks generated from their clouds using these techniques.<p>Regardless of how much effort you have spent dealing with abuse, if you are only playing wack-a-mole, you are just wasting your time.<p>I know it is easier said than done, but probably adding a proxy to do throttling, enforce global limits to free users (ex. domain + ip per hour/day), and stopping/reporting DoS attempts would had been a better investment than trying to prevent users from using Mailinator.",1427394970

In an age appropriate manner and wording (vocab, tenses, allusions to other works, etc) Hatchet explore what it takes to <i>mentally</i> be an adult. Brian&#x27;s near suicide and rebirth alone in the Canadian forests is a classic story in literature, and it is no where else better played for young adults than in Hatchet.

I haven&#x27;t taken much advantage of that yet, but you can do things like create a &quot;TOC&quot; tag that builds a table of contents by inspecting child documents and looking for h1 tags (or looking for, say, &quot;chapter&quot; tags, which you&#x27;ve defined to expand to &quot;<h1 class=&#x27;chapter&#x27;>&quot;), or inspect the contents of paragraphs and subtly shift the first line margin to the left if the first character is a quote mark (which Butterick&#x27;s <i>Practical Typography</i> does). You could replicate some of that with a template language that allows user-definable tags, but I don&#x27;t think you could do all of it.<p>Its biggest weakness, at least for me, has been finding a pleasant workflow. Despite having a built-in web server it feels kind of clunky compared to other static site generators. You&#x27;re largely on your own for writing a deployment script (&quot;raco pollen clone&quot; is not a valid substitute). The DrRacket IDE is virtually a requirement for Racket programming, but it sucks teabags for editing long prose documents; you&#x27;ll likely find yourself working in one editor for Racket language files and another for Pollen source. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a dealbreaker, but it&#x27;s at the least annoying.",1427392912

It also doesn&#x27;t have the requirement to fall back to vanilla Javascript. As an added bonus, Javascript could easily compile down to LLVM bytecode.<p>LLVM has a single implementation, is very complex, isn&#x27;t even remotely portable, and is primarily suited to C and C++, or similar languages.<p>We also already have a very performant transformation format for LLVM IR into JS: asm.js.

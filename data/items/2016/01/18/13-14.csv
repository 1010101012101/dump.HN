It&#x27;s the branch of psychology that focuses on the question of how the brain works.<p>One part of the science involves studying people who have had parts of their brains damaged through illness or accident; one of its overall findings that many people find surprising is what little pieces our brains functionality is broken down into.  For instance, there are portions of your brain which match the emotional feeling to the visual input; when this system is damaged, you look at your family and feel nothing.  (This in turn leads to a belief that your family has been replaced by impostors -- they look the same and sound the same but <i>feel</i> difference.)<p>Relevant to your drug trip, there are also parts of the brain responsible for &quot;the feeling that your are in your body&quot;.  When these parts of your brain are inhibited -- for instance, by a drug -- you feel detached from your body.<p>All of which is to say, you may find it interesting to study how your mind works from the outside looking in, through cognitive psychology, instead of from inside looking out during a drug trip :-)",1453125138

We decided to switch to Github Enterprise and haven&#x27;t looked back since.<p>Some of the issues we had with Phabricator:<p>1. Phabricator is actually a suite of different applications that do specific things (e.g. source code hosting, issue tracking, project management, ...). Although Phabricator ticked all our feature boxes, some of the components it ships with are very immature and/or don&#x27;t get a lot of attention from the development team.<p>2. For some reason the platform as a whole feels like a CRUD layer on top of a data model. The UI and various workflows in the applications are very tightly coupled with the underlying data model. I guess that makes it easy to develop and maintain the various core applications of Phabricator, but it doesn&#x27;t make for a very user-friendly or usable product.<p>3. We have ~150 internal repositories, we actively work on ~40 of them at any given time. The source code application doesn&#x27;t seem intended for that many repositories (e.g. navigating to a specific repository is non-trivial)<p>4. Phabricator has a fundamentally different approach to &quot;pull requests&quot;. It works really nice, but only if you commit to using the Phabricator Way Of Doing Things. However, our team has been working on Github.com for years, and we&#x27;re so used to the Github-workflow that we couldn&#x27;t get used to the Phabricator workflow.<p>In the end Phabricator just wasn&#x27;t the right tool for us. It definitely has some attractive properties: it&#x27;s easy to install and upgrade, the command line tools are solid and provide all functionality you need, and it performs extremely well even on a small EC2 instance.<p>(EDIT: formatting)",1453124608

Al Jazeera America never really had the time to establish itself as a respectable journalistic unit.

As far as I can tell from the outside (though with some good colleagues who work there), U.K. universities seem to want the research output and grant funding of U.S.-style &quot;tenure-track research faculty&quot;, but without being willing to give the relatively low teaching loads that U.S.-style research faculty have, instead having teaching expectations more akin to what in the U.S. are called lecturers or teaching faculty, or just regular faculty at universities not considered research universities (these faculty in the U.S. <i>don&#x27;t</i> have particularly high research/grant expectations). And to sweeten the pot, they also offer fairly poor pay.<p>The one big advantage seems to be that job security comes much quicker. The U.S.-style &quot;tenure clock&quot;, where you have six years to either be promoted or leave, is pretty stressful.

Templates would slow your build time a lot though, so they come with a price. C++ would never beat C on build times, but C never came close to Pascal, back in the day, and I&#x27;m pretty sure C# still beats the guts out of C with hands tied. :)<p>> Funny that you mention the decoupling of state and logic, because I see that as a non-issue in C.<p>I beg to differ. Decoupling logic and <i>raw data</i> is not an issue in C, but state is not the same as raw data. You may have the same state data duplicated in memory (e.g. an index), and there&#x27;s also the issue of representation of state which is not portable (e.g. pointers, particular data structure). You also have pointers to functions (logic) in your data if I understood you right.<p>With C++ (or any sufficiently high level language) you can easily abstract away the difference between state and raw data. If you&#x27;ve got function pointers or pointers to instances of logic objects (which is a must if you don&#x27;t want to litter your code with long switch clauses), you could save them as type IDs or something akin to that.<p>You might be programming something very different, but so far most good C code I&#x27;ve seen was thoroughly objected-oriented. Not in the sense it religiously followed the 3 pillars of OOP, but in the sense it coupled structs with several functions that have been meant to use on solely with these structs and sometimes employed polymorphism by embedding function pointers in these structs.<p>All of that is much easier to do with C++ classes, and if this is all you wanted (and you don&#x27;t think you need proper separation of data from bone fide state), you can have a code that would refresh the vtable pointer in memory, and would sure be more straightforward than manually updating function pointers all over the place.<p>> It currently lacks safety and proper compression, so if I get serious about it I&#x27;ll probably make all network data go through validation functions, which helps with both compression and handling hostile data.<p>Validation is nice, but you can&#x27;t foresee every weird way your data could be shaped. It&#x27;s very easy to miss one small corner. That&#x27;s why you see several security engineers going around these threads dissing C. :)",1453122644

Visio needs to die. I was working on something similar myself (a little more limited in scope) but got distracted.<p>Just a feature suggestion - localize the hot-keys for shapes into something one can reach with solely their left hand, so as to free up their right hand for mouse actions. Between use the keys &#x27;asdfgwerv&#x27; as main menu items (e.g. triangles, squares, etc), then associate each of those components with one of those keys, which when pressed will open up a sub-menu (regular triangles, isosceles, etc) accessible by the same keys.<p>[1] <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/TBUycHc.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/TBUycHc.png</a> Something like that, where onKeypressUp pane_2 renders the contents of pane_1.",1453122249

Telecommunications and airplanes allow people to literally bypass the countryside and hop from city to city. Cheap transportation costs mean that markets are distributed and not as heavily reliant on local expansion as they were. Before, if an industrial business wanted to expand, doing it locally was the easiest and cheapest option; that&#x27;s not true anymore, and in fact it&#x27;s often counter-productive for some types of businesses (ones that can get critical mass online but not necessarily in their own country).<p>The only real barrier left, IMHO, is linguistic. English works in most cases but not all, and especially in some European regions there is still a heavy preference for localized languages.",1453122155

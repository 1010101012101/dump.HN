Things like this, particularly, will need to be easily modified and extended to fit into certain environments, and with no sample source code it's very hard to know how easy that will be. Obviously don't open-source, that kills your business model, but maybe it would be nice to provide a few sample files, or even a stripped-down ""basic"" version, just so we can get an idea of your coding styles and see if we'd be able to extend the code to fulfill our needs. This isn't a specific criticism of this software, which looks cool and seems to provide a lot of the features of the more expensive enterprise-y solutions at a much more friendly price point, it's just a general criticism of software on this model.",1330419571

I currently live in a town where, due to the recession, a large percentage of people are living on social welfare. The thing is that a shockingly large number of them (that I know personally) have no ambition to do anything else. Some of these have been on welfare for five years already. I mean, why work when the government will just give you money, right? Another shockingly large number of young couples are having children because they see the extra child benefit money - someone that I know personally who already has two children under the age of four and wants a third one recently said how much easier their life would be with the social welfare benefits of a third child... I'm not sure if they ever considered that 1) children get significantly more expensive as they get older and 2) how unfair it is to the children to bring them into a low income family.

3642433,comment,3642106,3642106,60,0,grellas,,,"The U.S. has a strong free enterprise foundation and its laws reflect this. Freedom of contract remains the rule even though it is much criticized in some circles and has been hedged considerably over the years. In employment, the old rule was that you could pretty much fire anyone at will for any reason and, if you did, you incurred no legal consequence. This is pure freedom of contract. In time, this unrestricted freedom came to be deemed repugnant where it bumped into important social policies - for example, that employers not discriminate on the basis of race. Hence, protective laws were passed and these circumscribed the old unrestricted freedom to have pure at-will employment relationships that gave an employer an open ticket to fire people for any reason whatever, even a repugnant one. That said, however, when you get down to the day-to-day employment relationships that most of us encounter, the at-will rules still prevail and, with limited exceptions, it really does remain the case that most people can be fired for any reason at any time and almost always without legal consequence. This may be seen as good or bad but it is the way of life under U.S. law with its strong bent toward free enterprise and freedom of contract.<p>The same pertains to overtime rules for employees. The U.S. does have a body of protective laws that require employers to pay overtime for excess hours worked, either by the day or by the week. But the historic relationship between employer and employee had a strong bias toward freedom of contract - that is, if an employer and an employee agreed to a certain working relationship, that was their prerogative and the government had no say in the matter. Again, this older form of unrestricted freedom led to consequences deemed repugnant as a matter of social policy (e.g., sweatshops). Thus, laws were enacted to abridge the older unrestricted freedom of contract (wage and hour laws, in the example considered here). But, as in the case of at-will rules, these laws did not disturb the large measure of freedom of contract that formerly prevailed except for the specific situations where a policy judgment was made that the workers were most vulnerable and in need of protection. Thus, U.S. overtime rules apply without question to low-skilled jobs and to low-paying jobs and to jobs where the employees have little or no independence or control over how they perform their duties. But these protective rules can and do peacefully co-exist with an equally important set of rules providing that high-skilled employees, skilled professionals, employees with substantial administrative responsibilities with managerial functions, and like positions are expressly exempted from the overtime rules. The idea is that, in a free economy, as a matter of policy, it is better for parties to retain freedom in defining the work requirements of a position than for the government to dictate protective rules where the parties are not deemed in need of protection. In other words, the employer-employee relationships for such exempt categories are deemed to be healthier if the parties are free to negotiate salary/bonuses or other compensation that is not tied to rigid rules about overtime. The laws let the parties have much more flexibility in deciding how to frame their relationships, and this basically reflects the old-style freedom of contract that has always characterized the U.S. economy. Protections were adopted as deemed necessary but they are limited as a matter of public policy. This can be seen as good or bad but it is the law in the U.S.<p>What does this mean in practice? It means, for example, that a computer professional can be paid a salary of $100K/yr and be asked to work like a slave, all without overtime compensation. But that same professional, if paid $30K/yr, is required to be paid overtime for excess hours worked, even if that person is on salary. One case is treated as appropriate for free choice by the parties without overriding restrictions; the other is not. And the difference, in this case, turns on the amount of salary paid - the highly-paid worker is treated as being able to protect his own interests while the relatively low-paid worker is not.<p>Europe clearly has taken a different approach and this too can be seen as good or bad depending on one's perspective. In general, in Europe, the idea of open-ended freedom of contract is suppressed in favor of more sweeping protective laws favoring employees. Whether this leads to a robust economy or chokes enterprise is open to debate but it clearly differs from the U.S. approach.<p>In this piece, the author criticizes the U.S. employment pattern as, in effect, requiring exempt computer professionals to work for free when they are required to work excessive hours tied to a fixed salary. In making this point, the author admits that his European biases are showing. The ""U.S. view,"" if I can call it that, is not that the worker is being made to work for free but rather that the worker has not agreed to be paid by any hourly measure but rather for an overall performance to be rendered, no matter how many hours it takes. This might be regarded as ""slavery,"" but (taking, for example, the exemption for executives) does anyone really believe that top executives have as their focus the exact number of hours worked as opposed to broader goals related to their job performance. The same can be said of professionals, as many computer professionals look primarily to the task and not to the hourly measure as the mark of their jobs. In my field, lawyers too see the hours worked as entirely secondary to their jobs. For every such executive and professional who would be deemed ""helped"" by overtime laws that might be extended to apply to their jobs, there would undoubtedly be many who would recoil at the limitations of suddenly not being able to do their jobs without regard to the scope of hours worked. I don't believe that most such employees see their work as ""slavery"" when they have to work excessive hours. I think they see it as career development. And, in any case, the U.S. law gives such employees freedom to become ""slaves"" if they so choose for their own reason. It is the old freedom of contract and highly skilled, highly compensated workers in the U.S. retain that freedom to choose, as do their employers.<p>Work-life balance <i>is</i> very important as well, a point the author emphasizes. He seems to have made that choice later in life (as did I) and I commend him for it. But, while I can exhort others too to strive for such balance, I will not begrudge them the choice to work exceedingly hard (especially as they are first developing in their careers) to achieve other ""unbalanced"" goals. People do accomplish insanely great things by working insanely hard. If they choose to do this in their work as employees, that is their privilege and, as long as they are highly-skilled and highly compensated, I say more power to them if they do it without the benefit of protective labor laws.",1330418486

REST means representational state transfer, which means that each application state should have a representation on the server. Another way of expressing this is that each possible state on the website should have an URL. No more ""go to example.com and click X, then Y then scroll then Z"". Instead, every possible state has a link, so you just give the link. HTTP was designed to enforce linkability.<p>Enter AJAX. Suddenly the server is out of control. You can now deviate from the linkability principle, and a lot of apps do.<p>When the linkability constraint is lifted, the client state is allowed to deviate from the server state. This gives less responsibility to the server. No wonder that it gets less to do.<p>That is what I meant.<p>You can still use a REST API from a web 2.0 website, that is another question.

Without that, the property belongs to whoever can defend it, and whoever has the most guns wins.<p>This becomes even more significant with the advent of intellectual property, also an invention of the State. There are many digital examples of ""everything belongs to everyone"" that are going extremely well, and luckily with zero government tyranny required. Meanwhile, the patent system is a mixed bag at best: sometimes promoting/reward innovation, sometimes inhibiting/punishing it. I don't know how this balance should be struck between sharing and ownership, but I know that the way we're handling it now is deeply sub-optimal.<p>The concept of ownership and the ways in which we trade are social constructs, the economic ""rules of the road"". They are malleable, not inherent, and we can rewrite those rules however we wish to manage externalities such as worker safety or environmental damage. Obviously, if it is done poorly (or disingenuously), the results will not go well. But we take for granted the times when it <i>does</i> go well.<p>> The book ""The Not so Wild Wild West""<p>I'll look into this. I'm definitely a proponent of the social contract occurring at a more local level, where people are actually people instead of numbers in a database. But I'm skeptical that it is enough sustain this thing we call civilization. Just because people <i>can</i> be rational and altruistic does not mean they will.<p>> when a society decides to indulge in welfare and collectivism, it almost never goes back and ends up going bankrupt and ruining everyone<p>There is an element of truth to this; many European entitlements go too far and cost too much (as has often happened with American unions as well). But I don't buy that social programs are inherently inefficient; there are many things that matter which don't show up on balance sheets. Stress, health, environment, social bonds, self-determination, respect: these things all matter to a society's quality of life and its bottom line, but are very hard to measure or draw profit from.<p>Also, we must look at the other side of the historical coin: turn-of-the-century America, where industry held all the bargaining power, and the whole family had to work 60+ hour weeks in dangerous factories with no human rights protections. Or, workers who lived in ""company towns"", in a life one step away from indentured servitude. I have a hard time not seeing strong similarities between Amalgamated Warehouse Whatever and the Dickensian hellscape of a century ago (or Foxconn, for that matter).<p>I suppose I just don't like dogma: MARKETS GOOD, GOVERNMENT BAD. The common thread between democracy and capitalism is to lessen the corrupting influence of power by distributing it: one person = one vote, and every person wielding their own power over buying and selling. But there is no system that is immune from manipulation and corruption; the incentive to game the system and maximize one's own power to the detriment of others will never go away. If we want to prevent tyranny, we have to constantly evolve ways to distribute power again, whether it takes the form of markets, governments, communities, or new organizational patterns we haven't thought of yet.",1330417050

This chain of comments was sparked by yummyfajitas asking ""does the US pay less to import oil or steel than Sweden or something?"", which seems fairly focused on price.  And he was replying to a comment that claimed that American prosperity was due, in part, to ""military might abused to ensure cheap oil and resources"".  Which, again, seems awfully focused on price.<p>Now, you might want to change the subject to talk about oil company profits, but I'm not sure why you'd want to, because that makes even less sense.  It's frankly ludicrous to suggest that American prosperity is in some way linked to the fact that ExxonMobil is headquartered in Texas rather than Canada or Europe.  It's a publicly traded multinational corporation!<p>Sure it paid $15 billion in income tax in 2009, but none of it was in the US.  Think that number would be higher if they were incorporated offshore?  (Hint:  No.)  Yes, it pays dividends, but it does so regardless of whether those shareholders are citizens of the country it is headquartered in.  Think the ratio of dividends paid to Americans versus Swedes would change if ExxonMobil moved offshore?  (Hint:  No.)  And since this ""isn't about the price of oil"", we don't need to even ask if prices at the pump in the US would change if they moved offshore.  (Although, obviously, they wouldn't.)<p>So I'm curious:  The original post was talking about how America is richer than Sweden 'cause the American military is used to do <i>something</i> relating to oil.  You say it's not about the price, but about oil company profits.  Okay.  Even if we accept that the US military has done wonders for the bottom line of ExxonMobil...how does Joe Bloggs become better off because a nominally American oil company is making a higher profit this year?  Answer:  He doesn't.  So maybe we need to look a little further.<p>(And that's not even touching on the idea that military might is exogenous - this <i>thing</i> that some lucky countries have, and others don't.)",1330416562

Though computer-related jobs are called out specifically in the law, programmers would also likely be exempted from overtime as ""professionals"", in any case.  I don't think that the overtime exemption for programmers has anything to do with fear of losing jobs overseas, in that most programmers make SUBSTANTIALLY more than the minimum wage.  If employers were forced to pay overtime, then they would just reduce base salaries accordingly.",1330416217

I personally have failed miserably to be happy with my life if my 8 hours of work a day sucked or were mediocre, I want all of my waking hours to have meaning.

You don't make a country great by forbidding extra work regardless of the employee desires.  You make a country great by allowing employers and employees to decide amongst themselves case by case.  If labor wants to forbid this for other vocations good for them.  I would like to keep my right to work more hours on salary or not.",1330416016

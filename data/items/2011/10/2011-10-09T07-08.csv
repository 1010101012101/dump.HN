3089959,comment,3083349,3084223,1,0,koko775,,,"Well, more accurately, Safari was born from KHTML. WebKit was Apple's massive retooling of it, and was widely acknowledged as superior to KHTML (someone correct me if I'm wrong) and in time replaced it. However, your point isn't necessarily invalidated, as iirc the changes were simply dumped in one large mass rather than as patches.<p>Additionally, OS X was created from NeXTSTEP, which - again, if I recall correctly - was built on a licensed, proprietary UNIX, so claiming that using BSD for the underlying system in some way took something away or co-opted it, as opposed to made use of it as the license allowed, seems slightly inaccurate.<p>That said, while I am a big fan of Apple's APIs I am astoundingly opposed to the App Store's walled garden - I surprise even myself, a self-professed fan of many things Apple - with the complete and utter disdain with which I view the terms of the App Store. It really is a jail, and it's a huge problem for the company I work at. Other than the BS about how some of our content might offend sensibilities according to some nebulous standard of western values (disclosure: I work at a company that streams anime), the policies applied seem to do little else than stifle competition.<p>tangent:<p>With Siri, I see something bad as well. It seems that controlling the user experience of search - the user experience, the anointed services - leads down a path where it is not the search providers with the best results or presentation which win, but the one which Apple anoints with their approval. Apple seems to think that producing the device entitles them to applying rules which enable Apple to step in and compete with an advantage on things which are not their core competencies. I think this is dangerously close to anti-trust territory, in which a monopoly (not bad by itself) could be abused to foster anti-competitive acts.<p>/tangent",1318146874

3089956,comment,3089634,3089803,4,0,rdl,,,"It definitely varies per person.<p>There's clearly a level of financial uncertainty where a founder is LESS productive.  But, there are ways (which don't necessarily overlap) a founder could spend ""excess"" money which don't inhibit drive at all.<p>Probably the lowest hanging fruit would be to eliminate actual debt (founders may have student debt, credit card debt from earlier in the company, etc.); getting rid of debt probably won't change behavior.  Maybe other health-related things.  Actually, a lot of this could just be handled as ""generous startup perks"" vs. payouts; if I knew I could always fly in domestic E+ or upgrade-to-F on my preferred airline, and stay in a decent hotel, I'd be a lot more into taking back to back business trips all the time.<p>Taking care of someone else's expenses (e.g. kids, parents, or other dependents) probably won't reduce motivation, either.  Fixing things which inhibit a founder's productivity (paying for a housekeeper, driver in some cases, closer apartment to the office, ...) seems like a good idea.<p>It's probably a bad idea to pay someone enough to become an investor, or to buy/build a house (oh god no for BUILDING), indulge in expensive AND time-consuming hobbies, etc.<p>The gray area is when founders would actually take an outright sale, but are given a choice of $5-10mm now and continue instead; that's enough to possibly reduce drive, but not as much as selling out.<p>One option might be to put some of the payout into a ""lockbox"", where it's safe for reasons of diversification, but not accessible.  e.g. you sell, get $1-2mm into your 401k, or into an account which is inaccessible (but safely invested) for 5 years.  That way, your downside risk is covered if the company tanks, but your lifestyle doesn't change.<p>Although, anything like this will make Bay Area luxury car dealers very sad. :(",1318146783

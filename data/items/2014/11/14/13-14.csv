8607083,comment,8605978,8605978,0,0,tom_b,,,"A more recent article addressing this essay from the same author:<p><a href=""https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/08/22/hacking-academia/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/08/22/hacking-academia/</a><p>The tl;dr summary from this second article referencing the first:<p><pre><code>  a quick summary is this: scientific research in many \n  disciplines is becoming more and more dependent on the\n  careful analysis of large datasets. This analysis requires\n  a skill-set as broad as it is deep: scientists must be \n  experts not only in their own domain, but in statistics, \n  computing, algorithm building, and software design as \n  well. Many researchers are working hard to attain these \n  skills; the problem is that academia&#x27;s reward structure is \n  not well-poised to reward the value of this type of work. \n  In short, time spent developing high-quality reusable \n  software tools translates to less time writing and \n  publishing, which under the current system translates to \n  little hope for academic career advancement.\n</code></pre>\nI think the HN title is somewhat misleading, the central thesis from the original article is stated as:<p><pre><code>  the skills required to be a successful scientific\n  researcher are increasingly indistinguishable from the \n  skills required to be successful in industry\n</code></pre>\nThis is probably a stunningly awesome outcome - it means that industry has a place for advanced degree holders who will not find a classic academic position.  In the linked essay above, from the same author:<p><pre><code>  the number of PhDs granted each year far exceeds the \n  number of academic positions available, so it is simply \n  impossible for every graduate to remain in academia.\n</code></pre>\nI wish people would not use &#x27;big data&#x27; as a label in these discussions.  I think the essential truth is that being able to apply a scientific, quantitative thought process to problems combined with the ability to write software to provide others with solutions to those problems is valuable across academia and industry.  That doesn&#x27;t really have much to do with the &#x27;big data&#x27; meme flaming across the skies these days.",1415973328

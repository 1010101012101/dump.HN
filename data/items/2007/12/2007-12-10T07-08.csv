And so agreeing to sell crack when approached is not entrapment (no one was explicitly encouraged to do so), whereas repeatedly soliciting crack is.<p>I'm not sure where SlutBot would fall along this continuum, but it seems that there's at least a case that its use would be legally viable.",1197272196

That is the company can award additional shares and options that will make your 4 shares a smaller part of the pie. <p>In theory, this should only happen if the person getting the extra shares puts more money into the company, so you will have a smaller share of a bigger pie.<p>In practice, it doesn't have to be. You can just get a smaller share of the same pie...<p>On the other hand, should you prove you worth to the company, it is customary that you will get additional options granted later on, as the company will want to keep you interested and motivated.<p>For an early stage startup, both have an even chance of happening.<p>I've had both happen to me (with the same startup). By the time the startup was bought I had a bigger option grant then I started with - but it was worth much less due to dilution.<p>Bottom line: the amount or portion of stocks you are granted when you start working is meaningless or close to meaningless.<p>But I'd take the job anyway. San Fran is cool.<p>Good luck!

Starting also with the broken pseudo-maternal AI that guide you through the first half of the game before <i>spoiler</i>spoiler<i>spoiler</i>. <p>Within my limited experience with talking to artists and poets, I don't think artists deliberately set out to include specific symbols inside a work. Too much left-brained stuff.  Which I find funny as a deconstruction essay requires you to spell out exactly what it is you are talking about. Kills the mood.<p>Yet most artists that are any good at their craft easily tap into something that hits you in the gut. I think Portals is one of those games. I have not played it, but I bet it does mess around in your head in ways beyond just messing with your sense of space-time. I wasn't too hot on playing it, however, after reading the article, I want get a copy now.",1197270709

Unless you're a real down-home homebody type - then it may be your worst nightmare. ;-) <p>$60K is great for 19. As usual there are a bunch of people talking about how it ""isn't much for the bay area."" But - ignore them. Most people outside of the tech industry in SF don't make $60K, and they get by. Most 19 year olds are making $7/hr, part time.<p>How to live large on $60K in SF:<p>- Don't rent your own place at first. It is better to live with roommates. You can rent a room for $600-$1000, depending on how nice of a place you want and what neighborhood you're in.<p>- If you are working in the city, don't bring a car. <p>- If your job is in the city, don't live outside the city. Commuting costs aren't too bad, but if you live somewhere far out, like Berkeley or down on the Peninsula, and have to work late, you will get stuck covering a huge Taxi bill from time to time. <p>- Learn to love cheap food. Burritos, Pho, Bahn mi, pizza slices, etc. <p>- Being 19, you're too young to go to bars, so you will automatically save a lot of money on the weekends...<p>- Craig's list, Chinatown and IKEA for all your house stuff<p>- Costo, Trader Joe's for groceries and sundry items<p>It should be pretty fun. <p>I moved to Manhattan when I was 19. Manhattan was and is still way more expensive than SF. I only made $55K, and I managed to save about $10K my first year there, and I went out and did random stuff all the time.",1197270629

Most people simply dig in deeper when they get a little more money. They buy a bigger house with a bigger mortgage, fancy cars, and other expensive junk. Then they're really hooked.",1197270204

8740307,comment,8739352,8739959,0,0,zarriak,,,"The biggest thing about the difference between Russia and the United States is the end goal of their actions. Putin is ensuring his power base, while the US is trying to stop terrorism. I don&#x27;t like what they are doing but this is what the NSA thinks what works to stop terrorism. If you look at both President Obama and President Bush they did close to the same things regarding national security. It may be a faulty assumption, but this leads me to believe that there are things that these programs protect the western world from. The people who work for the CIA and NSA aren&#x27;t idiots and they definitely have committed some horrible actions, but they wouldn&#x27;t being continuing these missions if they were futile.<p>I would like to live in a world without religious extremism, but it has and will always exist. They utilize the poverty and illiteracy of certain places in the middle east to make teenagers believe suicide bombing is the way to get to heaven. Humanity is facing many existential crises and this is the way we are currently handling one. It is definitely not an optimal solution, but it doesn&#x27;t matter if we can&#x27;t solve our ever increasing CO2 emissions and the many other problems resulting from greenhouse gases.",1418396352

8740299,comment,8739628,8739628,0,0,userbinator,,,"I see a lot of the antipiracy efforts now being directed towards end-user devices; in particular, mobile. I think the trend of walled-garden environments with app stores, the app-centric model of interaction, and all the increasingly locked-down (always in the name of security) features of modern OSs are where the real battle is being fought, and it&#x27;s one that they seem to be winning: with data being managed by and hidden behind apps, touted as a feature of convenience, the users of these new consumption-oriented devices are being distanced from direct control of their data, and this greatly increases the effort required for them to pirate. If the majority of the population eventually only has access to one of these heavily locked-down devices (and traditional desktops/laptops become a niche product), then it&#x27;s easy to see how file sharing could become virtually nonexistent - almost everyone will not even know what a file is, much less see any ways to copy and share the contents of one. The only sharing they would know of is that explicitly featured in the apps they use. It wouldn&#x27;t be too dissimilar to the world of Stallman&#x27;s Right To Read ( <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html</a> ).<p>Fortunately most computer users today still know about files and torrents, and hopefully that knowledge continues to thrive, but I do see large-scale attempts at fundamentally changing how we interact with computing devices that could eliminate that knowledge and those freedoms associated with it in the future. Taking down TPB and chasing the other torrent sites isn&#x27;t quite as effective as systematically eliminating the knowledge that makes those sites possible; in other words, remove the concept of filesharing and &quot;the Internet it created&quot; will essentially kill itself.",1418396297

It turns out that this creates an advantage because right-handedness (and hence, same-handedness in pairings) is still >> 50%, so left-handers get very used to fencing opposite-handed, while it tends to throws off right-handers who aren&#x27;t as used to it.<p>The advantage goes away at a high level, but it create a bias towards more left-handers taking up and sticking at fencing, because they make more progress when starting out. They feel like they are better at fencing than other sports they might have tried, where they don&#x27;t have a strategic advantage by default.<p>Anyway, one of the obviously related subtle effects is what happens when you reach out to shake someone&#x27;s hand. If you reach out to someone opposite-handed, the result can be brief but tangible awkwardness. Little cues like that can add up to create a subconscious picture of something not being quite right, or perhaps even &quot;sinister&quot;.<p>Again, like with the fencing example, the left-hander is used to this because it happens to them 90% of the time. For the right-hander, it feels like something is off because it only happens 10% of the time, so they aren&#x27;t expecting it.",1418394403

One is that concise code usually requires strong familiarity with the language. For example, Haskell allows dense and readable code-- <i>if</i> you know Haskell. Same with Clojure (Lisp). I hate Java, but one thing I&#x27;ll say for it and its sprawling code is that it&#x27;s relatively easy to (superficially?) understand (with an IDE to jump around, because modest programs can be thousands of lines) with a mediocre knowledge of the language.<p>I&#x27;d say the same of research-level mathematics. If you&#x27;re intimately familiar with linear algebra notation and terminology because you use it every day, it&#x27;s concise and readable. If not, then &quot;(X^T<i>X)^(-1)</i>X<i>y&quot; looks like line noise.<p>The second issue is that what tends to make large codebases unreadable is a failure of factoring. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s </i>500 lines* that is the problem, because the intrinsic complexity of the problem may be at a level where 400-500 lines is appropriate. It&#x27;s when you have 500 lines in one class (ultimately, &quot;class&quot; and &quot;object&quot; are poorly-defined and that&#x27;s why so much OOP code is trash) or, worse yet, one function/method (method is just a code-name for &quot;locally interpreted stateful function&quot;) that you get hell code. This happens a lot in large imperative codebases (typically not becoming intractable until you have two or more programmers on the same code) because, in imperative code where an <i>action</i> (as opposed to stateless function) is the fundamental unit, things appear to compose better than they actually do.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s complicated. In general, there seems to be a density level that accurately represents the intrinsic complexity of the problem. Go denser and you&#x27;re forcing people to think in a specific (and poorly communicated) way to understand the implicit structure and policies that informed the code construction. On the other hand, typical sprawling Java code is great for testing your IDE&#x27;s scrolling feature but the amount that can fit on a single page is low, and if this is coupled with long methods and huge classes, you get OOP (here, meaning &quot;business OOP&quot;, not &quot;Alan Kay&#x27;s vision of OOP&quot;) spaghetti code.",1418393601

One wonderful thing about software development, is that credentials and pedigree are not required.  If you can make software, you can get a job.  Even if you can&#x27;t write software, there are lots of related jobs.  I&#x27;ve been writing software professionally for about 15 years or so.  Before that I had flunked out of an electrical engineering program a couple times, and was waiting tables to get by.  I considered myself a failure.  There is always hope.<p>Writing software isn&#x27;t really about intelligence, although it probably helps.  It isn&#x27;t really about knowing the &quot;one right way to develop software.&quot;  It is more about being willing to admit you are wrong.  Learn from your mistakes.  Also a good dose of stubbornness is needed to deal with tools that don&#x27;t work properly.  Sometimes the documentation will lie to you.  It helps to not take the little failures too personally.<p>Best of luck to you.",1418393583

Formally, his options are eat or don&#x27;t eat, but it&#x27;s clear that they are not equal from his point of view. He might not eat if his conviction is strong enough (say a hunger strike) but this doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the options are not equally balanced.<p>It is not fair or reasonable to assume that TV show aficionados have a strong enough moral conviction that copyright infringement is bad, compared to their desire to see more of the show. After all, in a way, the show is <i>designed</i> to make us want to watch more.<p>Okay, now on to the former alternative -- paying for cable and only watching GoT. The first thing that needs to be said that this alternative is not universal -- there are countries where HBO is unavailable. Even this simple fact has implications -- a non-trivial market for torrents, for instance. But let us ignore this and assume cable is available.<p>I think most people inside a capitalist society are trained to evaluate objects. This means that if you want to sell me a bundle, I divide the price based on the objects in the bundle. Usually, this is used by marketing in a devious, but smart way -- for instance by adding <i>free</i> modifications to a car, washing mashine, cell phone plan, what have you. In our case, it is detrimental -- people who only want to watch GoT and nothing else hardly see value in the entire HBO bundle. In fact, they actually see negative value in it, especially if they do all of their TV watching via their computer.<p>The reason why I say they see negative value in the bundle is this: If you are asked to buy a fairly pricey bundle but all of the things in it except one do not interest you, you again divide the price... and note that you pay a lot of money for something you don&#x27;t need. That&#x27;s not a feeling a seller should promote.<p>I think the smart move by HBO would be to offer individual shows for purchase on their website, and alongside them offer the HBO subscription as a discount on all the shows. This way the bundle feels like a discount again.",1418393410

Bad times followed as we were busy and replacing a good developer is not easy.<p>Once the dust had settled I looked for a web app to ensure this problem never occurred again. I couldn&#x27;t find anything, and so my company built a HR app to simplify our HR processes and automate the heck out of them. A couple of years later www.staffsquared.com was born. So this was us building a tool to scratch our own itch, which is a common approach.<p>Story two...<p>My other half is obsessed about checking her bank account.

I haven&#x27;t had the chance to pursue this idea any further just yet.<p>So my approach is scratching a personal or professional itch.

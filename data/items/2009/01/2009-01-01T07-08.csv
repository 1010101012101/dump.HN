There's no catch phrase for someone who tends toward slight conservatism, but is generally open to government intervention, though I imagine such people exist.  That's at least two dimensions to consider, it seems to me we should at least have a plane.<p>Here's one, Net Neutrality, what is that?",1230796438

416315,comment,415889,416231,0,0,unalone,,,"All aptitude tests will fail once they become a standard, because suddenly test-takers are able to prepare for their test. Take the SAT. All students are told by teachers that it's in their best interests to buy books of old tests so they can see and memorize the questions and see patterns for answering in the new test. The test suddenly becomes a metatest: the real test is very often about how well you can prepare for a test. And in the end, it doesn't matter, because within a certain percentile colleges don't care. It's all so that CollegeBoard can make a lot of money and certain colleges can use the SAT as a qualifier to filter students more quickly.<p>A real aptitude test might test students' abilities to form opinions and chains of logic. They might test, rather than their ability to write a five-paragraph essay or to understand an analogy, the ability of a student to convey information with as precise language as possible. A math aptitude test may test a student's ability to prove points - but rather than using an obscure formula like current high school geometry, it would use natural language and grade on the idea rather than the jargon.<p>Really, the only aptitude test that matters and can't be faked is one for creativity, and that's only because you <i>can't</i> test on it. (A year ahead of me at the New Jersey Governor's School for the Arts, according to our head instructor, was called by CollegeBoard to try a hypothetical test for creativity - including a multiple choice section, of all things. The test was abandoned when all the handpicked students gave extremely different responses to every question.)<p>I think that's why colleges are abandoning the SAT test as criteria. Some top-notch colleges don't ask for test scores at all (some are even weaning away from GPA, which is a godsend for certain types of students). That's a smart choice on their part. What do test scores prove? Our year's valedictorian, a very bright girl who also took a dozen SAT practice tests, got a 1600 on the main section. I had no practice tests and got a 1510. In the end, the numbers are so close as not to matter. Even a perfect 800 category means nothing other than a person's happening not to slip up (and with a 4-hour test, slip-ups are all too common). Our principal, at a ceremony, gave us awards for our perfect sections while talking about how this made us perfect scholars. This is a terrible mindset with testing and it encourages things to get only worse.",1230795998

416310,comment,415933,416013,0,0,unalone,,,"Of course we're harsh. Start-ups are almost all extremely competitive, and the people who use start-ups are cutthroat capitalists. Everybody's looking for the absolute best things can get. I remember, two years before Tumblr launched, I would go between blogging platforms at the rate of one a week, pounce on every update, install and test every beta and every plugin, looking for a platform that would work well for me. I still do it with certain things. Any time a social network claims it's got something Facebook doesn't, I check it out. I'd like to think this isn't entirely unusual behavior here. People in this field are very often perfectionists.<p>With Scribd we're a mix of benevolent and indignant. Benevolent, because it's YCombinator. Indignant, because it renders text in Flash.In both cases, though, the response is the same. Benevolence isn't being kind and wishing good luck. Look at sites with that attitude, or real life institutions, and there you'll find the places where progress becomes stagnant. In order to encourage progress, it helps to have a bit of an edge. And it attracts the right people. I plan on launching a beta preview of my current project to members here, because I want to be ripped apart before anybody else sees this. I figure it'll do me and my partner a world of good.",1230795040

So now, this could be 10 years or more.<p>And the companies I've seen are in <i>no rush</i> to start your green card any sooner than they have to, as it costs them money (and you may just quit).<p>What's worse, there is some risk and complexity in switching jobs while on a visa; technically there is a chance you could lose all rights to stay in the U.S. when you quit your job.<p>So most people will work for a single company for many, many years, just to get their green cards.

416308,comment,415399,416078,0,0,unalone,,,"That's a really neat feature of the 360. I think it's an excellent media center.<p>At the same time, I agree with the ancestral poster: I wish that Microsoft and Sony held more reverence for gaming. I say this as somebody who wants to be a game developer: right now, gaming is easily the most disregarded artistic medium. Most games are sequels or spin-offs or rip-offs, have been for two generations. There are some games that rise to the top - the <i>Katamari</i> series and <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> both showed, on a mediocre system, just how hilarious/moving a good game can be - but even most of the top-name games are awful. The writing and character graphics of Fallout 3 made me cringe on quick glance.<p>Part of it is that games have become a generic commodity. You have the shooter genre, the RPG genre, the sports genre, the racing genre, and games compete to be the best of each every generation, and it's always the same groups competing. You don't have this treatment of a game as an art form.<p>Unlike movies where you start off in theaters, unlike TV shows which start off as incremental releases, with games the release is the release and that's the only release. Games lose their mysticism an hour after they've launched. It's terribly demeaning of the entire medium, the way things stand right now. And it hurts both the developers and the consumers to have games treated so matter-of-fact. It kills something that ought to be magical.",1230794614

</code></pre>
Well... that's somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy. Sites that get high PR show up first in search results, which helps them get more traffic, becoming more well known, hence becoming ""important"".<p>PR solves for your score (self consistently) by basically averaging out all the scores of everybody linking to you while coupling this with a (rather crude) model of user behavior. Of course, this is how it's described in the original paper and definitely very far from what actually goes on under the hood now a days.<p>It should also be noticed that several improvements on/replacements for PR have been suggested over the years, with:<p>TrustRank <a href=""http://www.vldb.org/conf/2004/RS15P3.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vldb.org/conf/2004/RS15P3.PDF</a><p>BrowseRank <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/tyliu/fp032-liu.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/tyliu/fp032-liu.p...</a><p>HITS <a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/auth.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/auth.pdf</a><p>being the better known ones.

416297,comment,415399,415862,0,0,unalone,,,"I'd like to add into the mix of console debate, as a Nintendo fanboy, that their ""purchase games online"" strategy fell really sadly flat. Back when it launched, the promise of an unlimited back library was really incredible. People thought it was a new era for gaming. Then the Wii Library (or whatever it's called) turned out to be pay-per-game, and they released games slowly (despite the games being basic emulator roms), and they were angling it as a counter to the XBox Live Arcade. Original content versus oldies which are free online.<p>The Wii has a lot of potential. I think that the control scheme is second-to-none, and that after Mario Galaxy (which showed just how effective it was) we ought to have seen a proliferation of good third-party add-ons. As it is, Nintendo is carrying the console itself, but it's proven itself fallible. It's still the single best game developer in the world, and its design team is head-and-shoulders above the competition. But the rest of the company isn't quite as top-notch, and it shows, and it unfortunately means Nintendo's ridiculous advantage over Sony and Microsoft is being entirely wasted.",1230794146

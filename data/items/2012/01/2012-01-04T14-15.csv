Its not my job to envision where these workers will migrate but its an unfortunate truth of life when processes become automated and require less people in the whole scheme.<p>And that's primarily how people maintain support for the associations instead of piracy or streamed content. Those ads in the theater of the key grip going ""piracy is killing my job"" is the pity response they're trying to drive from us. The Key Grip in reality shouldn't be hurting MPAA should be.

Meaning you don't get time to work on it, you simply work on something on top of what you already do. Which actually defeats the purpose and just gets employees to use their personal free time to work on a company project. Nonetheless, it's a good idea for a class, as long as you make sure to give them 20% of class time to work on it",1325689047

Is it a checkin service or a location review service, or is it a way to find discounts?<p>To Foursquare's credit, they realized that checkins were just a feature and not a business by itself, so they've begun to expand.  The problem is that there isn't a clear direction to where they're going.  Apps that do a better job of providing reviews will likely win on that front.<p>I see Foursquare's biggest potential in location based deals.  I think that's muddled by their focus on everything else though.  So I'd agree that they're in trouble.

In that context, <i>of course</i> they're in trouble.  It's a check-in game for crying out loud.  Last I heard, they had a valuation well over <i>half a billion dollars</i>.

They are made to do one thing reasonably well: Take a crappy satellite/cable/whatever signal and give you a reasonable image back.<p>...<p>> In general terms ""monitor mode"", if you will, should be a mode that bypasses as much of the internal processing as possible<p>...<p>> As I said before, they are designed to be TVs, not monitors.<p>I think this is 100% the problem. TVs these days essentially <i>are</i> big monitors, and they should be designed as such.<p>I believe that if a TV is taking content from a digital source (ie, HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort etc.), it should perform the bare minimum image processing possible. Things like scaling and gamma correction are necessary of course, but other operations like sharpening filters just destroy images and are unnecessary for digital inputs, and things like motion interpolation (ie. MotionFlow) are ridiculous (seriously, the only thing it improves is text like rolling credits, but it introduces serious motion artefacts to actual video and does strange things to noise in images, making the image look what I can only describe as 'slushy')...<p>This is just my opinion from being both an engineer but also having done a lot of film-making and photography work. It just appals me to see the default settings on these TVs degrading the images so much, and it takes a lot of searching through menus to set it to something sensible, which the vast majority of the population won't do...",1325688090

3424198,comment,3423909,3424001,1,0,makaio,,,"After reviewing the options some time ago, I ended up using encfs on top of Dropbox.  You still mount and unmount it like Truecrypt or Apple's encrypted disk images, but behind the scenes instead of creating an opaque block device to store the files, the individual files and directories are stored with their names and contents encrypted.  I like this method because individual files can be synced (which is the whole purpose of Dropbox), safe syncing does not require unmounting the volume, it can be mounted on multiple computers at the same time, is cross-platfrom, and I think it should be possible to revert individual files to a previous revision (though I've never tried).  The main disadvantage, from a security perspective, is that the existence of and approximate size of your files can be easily determined without decrypting.  This does not matter for my purposes, but might for some. It is also slightly more complicated to set up, although if you've ever mounted a filesystem from the command line in Unix you should have no problem.<p>Here is a nice overview of its use on OS X: <a href=""http://www.packetslave.com/2011/04/21/dropbox-encryption-w-encfs-on-macos-x/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.packetslave.com/2011/04/21/dropbox-encryption-w-e...</a>",1325686890

Up through 300 baud, each end used a tone for 0 and a tone for 1, and that was it. One bit = one symbol. (You could hear zeros and ones go by if you listened, and for Commodore owners, it was critical to be able to whistle the answer tone so you could trick the modem into hanging up - it auto-answered every call.)<p>So each baud carried one bit, and we got used to equating 300 baud with 300 bps.  Then came 1200 bps modems, which sent two bits per symbol (four discrete tones, IIRC); they were technically 600 baud modems.  It got more complex from there.

If I did work in a class, or in any context with a mentor, and did not receive assessment, I would feel cheated.<p>This is a great thing to do. I did something similar teaching English writing abroad - 80% free time (except it had to be writing of some sort) and I assessed heavily. This doesn't mean dry numbers tied to a near-sighted rubric.<p>Giving students ownership over their learning is essential, and this is the right direction. You have to extend this paradigm to all aspects of teaching (including assessment) rather than just leaving some parts out.",1325685958

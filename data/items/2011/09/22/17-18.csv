No sales guys, no business guys etc. You have never made any qualms about where you stood on the issue.<p>However, when one looks at AirBnB and what you have said about them, is it fair to say that above all it is hustle that matters to you? Given the function they were performing it seems like they were business guys  doubt they were writing any code, correct me if Im wrong here in my assumption that majority of the team was not neck deep in code.<p>My question to you, given the AirBnB example, where do you stand on the teams mix of founders?

The Via was better than the brewed coffee -- no surprise to me; I've consistently found Starbucks in-store brewed coffee to be lousy. (I can do a lot better at home, with the same beans.)<p>I never purchase Via, and neither do many others, I suspect, because at $1 or more per 8 oz cup, it just seems ridiculously expensive for instant coffee.  (Even if it's comparable to the in-store price for a brewed cup -- and, as I mentioned, tastes better.  If customers ever learn the latter.)<p>I've read that they use a centrifuge to ""dry"" it, and so I don't know what the production costs are.  But when I read that they are grinding beans very finely, rather than concocting an extract, and when I look at the physical quantity they are selling you, I can't help imagining that the margin on Via (minus marketing and all that crap) is exhorbitant.<p>Perhaps one problem is that if they dropped the Via prices, they'd undercut their in-store sales.<p>Anyway, Via's a decent product, but it seems to have limited opportunity under its current marketing.",1316714292

Traditionally I don't think the license has stopped Apple from contributing a lot back to the OSS community (just look at WebKit).<p>Besides, a compiler is just a compiler. Maybe someday down the road they will start producing their own ISA, but until then even if they're making their own ARM chips it's really hard to get it to do special Mac/iPad-only magic.<p>What I do know is that Clang was funded by Apple almost from the start, it was engineered right from the start to be more than just a compiler but something you could plug into the IDE as well (as the latest XCode demonstrates, it has completely unbeatable C insight).<p>LLVM itself is also far more extensible than GCC, just look at the slew of new-ish (last 3-4 years) of projects that have launched using LLVM.

This is a bit of a long submission, but after lurking on  HN for the last few years, I thought this might be a chance to contribute something back.\nIm just going to briefly discuss why my weekend project took so long, and how I got where I am.<p>The url is http://dudmail.com - it's a disposable email site. Similar in intention/scope to the many existing ones out there, but hopefully differentiated a bit based on how long we keep the mail (two weeks), and by accepting attachments and optionally forwarding the email onto a personnel email address. (And of course, by being mine =)<p>After being inspired by all of you that seem to be actually getting ideas off the ground, over the last couple of years I had tried (and failed) to get two or three other application ideas to succeed. One reason they failed was that my ideas were far too ambitious for me to pull off. Their scope was so large that I could never finish them off, and I never felt they were ready to be released.  It took a year or so (or more) before I was ready to give up on each idea, so this was a huge waste of time for me in terms of not failing often/early. Identifying this large scope issue as a failing,  I thought that a disposable email site was such a simple concept with a single well defined focus (ie email) that I should be able to knock something together quickly and actually get something released...<p>Why did it take so long? There were a few reasons... The guts of the site were actually thrown together pretty quickly  - not much longer than my naive weekend or two estimate.  The bits that let me down were:<p>- learning how to render a million different types of email sanely (still in progress).<p>- trying to learn how to bend postfix to my will (achieved)<p>- learning how to make a site design that didnt suck (sort of achieved)<p>- trying to work out why my application keep falling over (problem avoided)<p>- fear of actually releasing it / considering it finished.<p>The site was created using Ruby on Rails - it has a really simple database schema and it was all pretty straight forward. The biggest problem was rendering email - this turned out to be far more complicated than I expected. Plain text email is simple, but then you have to handle html mail, multi-part mail (text and html parts!), base64 encoded mail, mail in any one of a million different character sets, email with attachments etc etc. For html mail, you need to be able to render it within the css hierarchy on your page, without impacting adversely how the email was meant to be display. For emails in a odd unicode character set, you need to ensure youre handling and storing it correctly for every step of the process, or the end result will not be pretty.\nRendering email correctly was one of the hardest parts of this site, and Im still finding types of mail that Ive not yet encountered and havent handled yet.<p>Postfix was a real problem as well - Id never really dealt with it before, and what I was asking it to do was pretty far out of the ordinary. I wanted any email, coming to any email address, on any subdomain, on any valid domain to be forwarded to my Rails instance for processing. This was strange enough that fine folks in #postfix were hesitant to help me because of the 'overwhelming amount of spam' I could expect to receive. I was expecting 99.999% of emails to be spam, so this was cool.  In the end after many many hours, I was able to make it do what I wanted using virtual_alias_maps and some very generous regular expressions. Any email coming in gets forwarded to an alias, which then pumps it directly into the rails webserver as a POST request (to avoid firing up a rails instance for each email)<p>The next issue was that of design - Ive never been competent in this area. Initially I started off with a free template I found, but I quickly grew dissatisfied with how tacky it looked and at the same time, a number of excellent articles on designing for hackers flowed past on HN. (Not the book, but I have ordered that, and itll take a few weeks yet to get here, so wont be any use until my next project!). One of the articles was http://www.attackofdesign.com/improving-a-design-step-by-step-part-2/ which helped a lot. It again took a few weekends of effort, but I got there eventually. (Youll see some strong similarities with that article in regards to the colors I chose). In the end, Im not 100% satisfied with the design, but its not completely rubbish, and I dont think anyone would care as much as I do anyway =)<p>After having getting the app working, and the design mostly sorted, I posted a few links on some app directories to try and get some beta users. This was pretty successful, and I got a few users - not many, but enough to test that things were working. The problem was that things were not working, or at least not for long. After a few hours or days, the site would slow down, and then finally fall over and Id have to manually start it back up. The logs would have some errors about running out of memory, leading me to  assume I had a memory leak. I went through all the code with a ruby gem designed to track down memory leaks (bleakhouse), and found nothing. I switched from Apache+Passenger to nginx+unicorn and back again. I changed from Ruby 1.8 to 1.9 and even tried Ruby Enterprise Edition. I removed other apps I was hosting on the same machine, and killed all non-essential services. I tried periodical restarts of apache and postfix via cron at increasingly small intervals. None of this helped at all. I tried running monitoring software to restart the servers if things fell over (specifically monit) and this still didnt help. It actually seemed to make thing worse as the memory wasnt there for it to restart the services and then monit would get all messed up. In the end . . . on a hunch, I changed VPS providers (to rimuhosting.com), and the problems instantly went completely away.  Memory usage now stays well below 30% on average (about 280 meg), and Ive never seen it go above 50%. Ive not once had the application fall over in the two months its been on rimuhosting so Im pretty happy Ive got that situation resolved. It was frustrating though the amount of time I wasted trying to diagnose an issue that turned out to be out of my control. I am not naming the original VPS provider here. Seems it was most likely an issue on their end, but it could just as easily been something I fixed when I reset every thing up on the new provider. (And of course, having to re-install, reconfigure and test the entire rails, ruby,  capistrano, postfix stack soaked up another weekend)<p>Finally, having made the site stable, I posted out a whole bunch more links, and got a whole bunch more traffic and by and large its handled it. Not huge amounts, but far more than anything else Ive done. I get about 300 hits a day over 3000 page views and about 2000 emails coming in. Theres 600+ registered users and the number is climbing reasonably fast (for me at least).  Ive managed to get to page two of google results for disposable email and hopefully will manage to get a little higher yet.<p>Even now though I am hesitant to consider it finished - theres a couple of bugs caused by a race condition that I cant seem to track down, and Ive just found a new email type that Im going to have to deal with (emails with inline cid images that I think come from outlook).  However . . . six months down the track, Ive actually managed to release something that doesnt suck.<p>Check it out if youd like - http:\\dudmail.com - Id love to hear any feedback, criticisms or questions =)",1316713015

And telling someone it's easy when s/he actually is struggling is just as dangerous.<p>When I was learning C, I absolutely understood that a pointer pointed to something, and I wasn't bogged down by people telling me it was hard. That didn't stop me from dereferencing null pointers, returning addresses to variables on the stack, getting confused when someone added to a pointer, etc. The aptitude that Joel wrote about and Jon derides isn't the aptitude of applying a metaphor to code. It's the aptitude of coalscing a set of program behaviors into a mental abstraction that is more than ""a pointer points.""",1316711322

3026752,comment,3026230,3026690,1,0,nirvana,,,"I mentioned CDs in my article.  Did you stop reading at the first mention of gold?   Further, CDs are not a ""safe investment"" because the real rate of inflation (not CPI, but actual monetary inflation) is greater than the return of the CD, by quite a lot. Another risk of CDs is that the bank might fail.  Since the FDIC hasn't been collecting reasonable premiums against this risk, and banks are failing left and right, the deficit is made up via inflation, which means, you get paid back in lower value dollars than you lost.<p>This is also what makes gold a relevant possibility for this type of arbitrage.  Since gold's supply is relatively fixed, as the dollar declines due to inflation, the gold price will appreciate.  So, even if there were no increasing interest in gold from investors (e.g.: no appreciation due to increased demand) you'd be arbitraging the delta between the exchange rates of the two currencies.  Borrowing in dollars and buying gold.<p>This could be, as I mentioned, done between any two currencies.   Or, in the case of CDs, which I mentioned in my original comment, within the same currency.<p>But I guess that since I mentioned gold it is Very Important for you lot to say that gold is risky, and that I'm obviously falling to ""mention"" those things that I, uh, er, mentioned.",1316710934

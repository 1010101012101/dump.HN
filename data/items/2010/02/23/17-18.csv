I've turned down jobs because the workplace was a monoculture. And the single biggest negative for me of the space I'm currently co-working in is that it is entirely composed of white guys under 30. I may or may not be the best developer ever -- but the best programmers and businesspeople I've ever met share some of the same values. In other words a homogeneous environment will not only drive away 'diverse' people, but also may be doing the same for the best non-diverse people as well.",1266947629
1145908,comment,1144548,1145661,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Edit: Turned out to be a rather long reply with some background and descriptions of the differences and historical references. Outlines theoretical difference between socialism and communism as outlined by Marx, and then gets into why it's hard to nail down terminology in this sphere.<p>> ""/s"" is often used to connote sarcasm, in written text<p>Gotcha - missed the sarcasm that time.<p>> Recently, American politics has some groups label any regulation or public service as ""socialism""; eg, ""the FDA is socialism!""<p>Well, the FDA sucks in that it turns a huge blind eye to some horrible stuff while regulating some real petty, unnecessary stuff, and adds a lot of cost. For instance, fiber isn't considered an essential nutrient, so foods stripped of all fiber (most fast food) is perfectly legal, but other stuff is banned/controlled rather capriciously. But no, it's not socialism, just generic idiot bureaucracy.<p>> I've usually heard ""communism"" used to describe State-owned industry, whereas ""socialism"" is worker-owned.<p>Marx defined communism as a classless, rulerless society in perfect peace and harmony and infinite production and happiness and unity for everyone. However, he said the world would have to get through violent revolution. So it would be appropriate to say that socialism is government ownership of means of production, and workers control the government in some form or fashion.<p>> For example, profit-sharing, privately-owned co-ops, or credit unions would be socialism, under this definition<p>Nah, that's good ol' fashioned free enterprise right there, or capitalism if you prefer the term. I'm against socialism/communism because it doesn't work very well, but I'm very supportive of co-ops, worker ownership in a business, voluntary community-owned and sponsored projects, etc. None of that is socialism/communism, which includes threats of force/imprisonment/violence for doing subversive free market activities.<p>> North Korea would be communist but certainly not socialist. Is this definition outmoded or incorrect? I'd like to have a more accurate vocabulary for discussing these sort of things.<p>It's tricky to get a correct vocabulary, because people like to continually rebrand their political positions to sound more favorable. The Soviet countries called themselves Communist, but clearly didn't fit Marx's definition of ideal communism. That said, Marx's definition of ideal communism is literally impossible - people will always rank themselves, and when you take away the ability for people to rank themselves based on a particular criteria, they just pick something else. And often they pick something worse - party loyalty, military accomplishment, or academic accomplishment (except that academia is now controlled by the government, so academic work outside of the natural sciences all devolves into propaganda).<p>To give you an idea of the shifting lines and why it's hard to get a good vocabulary - Nazi Germany was <i>clearly</i> heavily socialist. ""Nazi"" is short for ""Nazionalsocialiste"". Hitler's party was the National Socialist German Worker's Party.<p>They actually did directly control a lot of industry. If you read some of Table Talk, which are basically minute-by-minute summaries of Nazi cabinet meetings recorded for preservation by Nazis, Hitler was constantly talking about planning the farming in Ukraine, or the chemicals production in Bavaria, or changing how the universities run in Vienna, or making cruises or automobiles more accessible to the people.<p>Clearly, clearly, clearly socialism under Marx's definition.  They hated the Russians, but saying Hitler hated Communism isn't quite accurate - he constantly talked about how ""Bolshevism"" was a huge problem, that was the Russian implementation. He didn't knock socialism/communism-itself very often.<p>But what do sociologists typically label Nazi Germany these days? ""Corporatist"". Hmm, what's that? Turns out ""corporatist"" is socialism where the the company is fully owned by the government, but has some very loose semi-autonomous management. It's basically just normal socialism. Yet it's called ""corporatism"", which anyone who isn't a sociologist would associate with corporations/capitalism/etc. It's not. The NSDAP (Nazionalsocialiste Deutsche Arbetitet Partei - The National Socialist German Worker's Party - shorthand, Nazis) were clearly a heavily socialist government.<p>But people who generally favor state-ownership don't want that association, so they call it ""corporatism"", which is just unnecessarily misleading and false. For all the things socialism does poorly, it actually does perform as well as capitalism at making war. The reason is that you can have the leader order a bunch of separate industries to work together - you get all the country's brightest people working on war under socialism. Amazingly, the USA was able to convince its best and brightest to largely volunteer for the war effort, but this is a rare thing. Under socialism, it's usually a lot easier to make war than worrying about getting industry to voluntarily participate. That's about the only thing socialism does better though - it starts to move too slowly and stagnate when there's more than one goal for the government to pay attention to, or the goal isn't extremely straightforward. One of the biggest things that breeds laziness and complacency is lack of competition; that's solved during wartime by the enemy. So socialism does okay at war, and pretty poorly at fulfilling diverse and changing wants and needs.",1266947584

The question isn’t what are we doing that’s keeping ladies out of the Valley, gentlemen.  The question should be why in God’s name are we still here.</i><p>The startup failure rate after 5 years is actually closer to 60 than 90%. Two comparisons come to mind:<p>In a standard company job, career stagnation and unrecognized toil are the standard. If you don't become the protege of someone important-- someone who will look out for you and make sure you're on the best projects-- in the first two years, it's no longer worth it to go to work in a lot of companies. Most people don't become proteges.<p>So, if you're ambitious at all, there's above a 60% chance you'll be looking for work again in 5 years no matter what you do.<p>Second, although the boring corporate job is safer, the enjoyment of startups comes from the fact that you're doing relevant, useful work (so long as the product you're working on has a successful launch and trajectory). To do relevant work isn't an option for most people in their early-mid 20s; even if they're brilliant, most companies expect them to ""pay dues"" before they can do anything interesting, and there are so many arcane, IO-bound permissions systems before even the smallest technological changes can be made.<p>In the startup, you have a 100% chance of doing relevant work for a product that has a sub-50% chance of ever existing. In the safe corporate job, less than 20% of what you'll do in your first three years is relevant work. It's tough to say which wins.<p>Personally, I chose the startup route under the belief that, no matter what happens, I'll learn a lot more-- that's a lot more important than what job title I get or what my pay is (as long as I can stay afloat). I figure that I can rewrite my own story a million times-- I've never had to resort to ""creative career repair"", but if I need to invent more impressive titles or inflate compensation, I can. On the other hand, knowledge and skill are completely impossible to fake. So I focus on a path where I learn a lot, not one where I get my tickets punched.",1266945818

If you figure out a way to exploit that, you’ll end up very, very rich. </i><p>First, just to get this out of the way, it's kind of embarrassing that pornographers are once again in the vanguard.  Now that that's out of the way, the author has an excellent point.  There must be a lot of educated moms who are having second thoughts about staying at home, for economic reasons or otherwise, but they look around and think, ""Crap, how the hell can I get a decent job here?  I'm stuck in Middle America, nobody cares that I'm an excellent writer and researcher, and even if I <i>wanted</i> to work as a receptionist, I'd be ridiculed by my coworkers for the lack of return on my graduate degree in anthropology.""  When people have second thoughts about their lives, maybe they persuade their families to turn their lives upside down, or maybe they decide not to.  Telecommuting from home is a great option for those who don't.  I suspect there's a culture gap between educated stay-at-home moms and ragingly ambitious (and sometimes very <i>narrowly</i> educated) twenty-something software entrepreneurs, but they're basically from the same class and should be able to get along without too much effort.",1266944463

9359180,comment,9356508,9356643,0,0,stupidcar,,,"I think everyone, including those who agitated against Facebook&#x27;s original patent license, understands and agrees that patent licenses are important and should be encouraged.<p>Where the original patent license was perhaps &quot;worse&quot;, in an ethical if not legal way, than no license at all, was that its limitations were non-obvious, and there was a feeling, right or wrong, that Facebook were attempting to restrict developers&#x27; rights by stealth. Licenses without any patent grant are problematic and uncertain, but they are at least problematic and uncertain in an obvious way, if that makes sense.<p>The original patent license felt akin to the Microsoft&#x27;s early attempts at &quot;shared source&quot; versions of their libraries and frameworks, where just reading the source code could theoretically curtail developers&#x27; ability to work on open source implementations.<p>I think it&#x27;s natural that people will react more negatively and forcibly to these kind of apparent bad-faith actions than to simple omissions. Furthermore, taking an aggressive stand against these sort of license tripwires hopefully makes it much less likely that others will attempt to insert similar clauses in future.",1428753225

9359178,comment,9352475,9355490,0,0,saalweachter,,,"The catastrophes involving space vehicles are certainly more <i>impressive</i> and <i>public</i> and <i>obvious</i>, but they aren&#x27;t particular large in terms of loss-of-life.  It&#x27;s not hard to beat with a building fire or a large freeway accident, let alone a series of small failures or the really impressive failures like structure collapses or industrial-scale explosions.  And while it&#x27;s true that <i>most</i> of us aren&#x27;t working on things which by themselves have the potential to cause these disasters by themselves, <i>many</i> of us are working on things that could spark an accident or cause one in progress to get worse.  Any small electrical device could start a building fire.  I&#x27;ve seen small USB devices, when left in a laptop in a bag, start smoldering.  It was only luck that it was noticed before combusting.  Nearly any component of an automobile could cause an accident -- the ignition switch, for instance.  I don&#x27;t remember if the floor mats were exonerated in the &quot;stuck accelerator&quot; cases (did it end up being driver error?).  People use Maps applications and GPSs to find hospitals -- if you don&#x27;t return the closest hospital or send people to a wrong address, people could die.  Most of us don&#x27;t work on Therac software that can directly shoot people to death, but it&#x27;s not hard for your bug to be one of a chain of things that go wrong.<p>Meanwhile, a lot of us work in or contribute to a culture which promotes risk-taking.  Risk-takers get a lot of the done and only sometimes have problems, and get promotions, bonuses, congratulated, and trips to tropical locales.  Sometimes things go wrong, but a lot of times you&#x27;ll be forgiven because you perform so well.  If you&#x27;re overly cautious, things may never go wrong, but you also won&#x27;t get as much done and you&#x27;ll probably not get as much praise, and might even be let go for being low-performing.  This may not directly result in any deaths, but it contributes to an industry-wide culture where risk-taking is the norm and success is defined as &quot;getting a lot right&quot; and not &quot;getting very little wrong&quot;.",1428753167

It&#x27;s called ThingieQuery (www.thingiequery.com).<p>When you install ThingieQuery, you get a SQL IDE window inside Excel. It uses an embedded SQLite engine to process the queries and uses the data from excel tables. Basically you get full SQL support inside Excel.<p>In case you want to query your excel tables together with the tables on an external db server you can do that as well. In this case the data from Excel tables will be copied in the form of temp tables to the external server. If you wish, you can write the results of your queries back to Excel.<p>It has syntax highlighting, code completion (currently rudimentary tho), and can do some neat tricks.<p>I&#x27;ve also made two tutorials so far:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld-mbyAGsow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld-mbyAGsow</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vjlEd2-bJQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vjlEd2-bJQ</a><p>I could be happier with the tutorials, but they do illustrate the point of the plugin.<p>I created the licensing infrastructure and the website, and am trying to launch it as a product so I&#x27;d really appreciate feedback.<p>If you do a lot of data manipulation in Excel and you&#x27;re good with SQL do give it a try.<p>Thanks!

There are a large class of problems for which heuristic search in logic domains is the most performant technique, and a significant class of problems where SAT solvers are feasible solutions.  Many of them are real world examples, rather than academic problems.  Also, many techniques are evolved or emerging for systems of logic that can handle uncertainty.  I&#x27;ve done work on hybrid systems combining rule-based systems with data-based systems (the typical process takes a rule-based system as a starting point and evolves it towards a pure data system as the data sets get large enough).

To do that, you might grab one of your old laptops with a 100GB harddrive from the closet and load up MySQL on it to hold the registration records.  You filed paperwork with ICANN and they recognize you as the <i>master authority</i> for .hackergeeks.  ICANN does not hold the database records for .hackergeeks, you do.  In turn, this means your computers are the ultimate authority for DNS resolution.   ICANN also doesn&#x27;t care whether you use MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQLite for registration records.  You just need to have some type of acceptable hardware infrastructure to administer the domains.  If you&#x27;re just selling a few thousand .hackergeek domains, your modest laptop would work.  Obviously, this is oversimplifying things but the idea is to picture some entity (that&#x27;s not ICANN) literally spending money on hardware+software+electricity to maintain a database.<p>Now, Verisign holds over 117 million .com domains[1].  Obviously, they have a lot more hardware infrastructure to handle that capacity.  Registrar resellers like godaddy or namecheap sell &quot;.com&quot; addresses but their datacenter computers don&#x27;t actually hold the master database records for the &quot;.com&quot; they sell -- it&#x27;s the Verisign computers that hold it.  Verisign also has a larger staff to handle non hardware stuff like legal processes (2 parties dispute ownership of a domain, fraud, etc).<p>Once the underlying technical picture is clear as to what <i>authoritative registrars</i> (not reseller registrars) <i>actually do</i>, then the pricing question can be analyzed.  We speculate that the overhead to run and maintain the master .com registration database to be somewhere between 9 cents and $7.85[2].  That&#x27;s a different question involving profit margin targets, competition, politics, etc that the accepted stackexchange answer explains.<p>To address the &quot;monopoly&quot;, how would a de-monopolized &quot;.com&quot; actually work from a technical standpoint?  Again, <i>somebody</i> has to maintain the master database.  Would we de-monopolize by having one Company ABC Inc to hold database records for A-M.com and another Company XYZ to hold records for N-Z.com?  We would then have DNS servers with an if/then/else statement to route queries to the correct database?  Or what if we do a SHA1 hash and distribute (shard) the &quot;.com&quot; database records over 10 different companies?  Company A has 17 million records.  Company B has 17 million records, and so on for a total of 117 million records we have today.  We&#x27;d then have DNS servers burning up cpu cycles calculating billions of hashes repeatedly to send queries to one of 10 databases.  Therefore saying &quot;Verisign has a monopoly over .com&quot; actually obscures the picture.  It is more important to avoid monopoly at the entire DNS level (via TLDs) instead of the &quot;.com&quot; level and that&#x27;s what we already have today.<p>With all that said, Verisign profit margins to administer the &quot;.com&quot; database is too high considering the falling prices of compute power and disk storage.  Maybe a better scenario would be a government non-profit entity.  The USA government already manages 300 million social security numbers, the millions of Federal Tax IDs for businesses, and passport IDs.  Therefore, the government managing databases of unique IDs is not outside the realm of possibility.  Another option might be decentralized ownership of &quot;.com&quot; via a distributed block chain similar to bitcoin[3].  I&#x27;m not familiar enough with it to know if it can handle the high registration activities of 117 million addresses.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.verisigninc.com/en_US/channel-resources/domain-registry-products/zone-file/index.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.verisigninc.com/en_US/channel-resources/domain-re...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.internetcommerce.org/dotcom_price_freeze/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetcommerce.org/dotcom_price_freeze/</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://namecoin.bitcoin-contact.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://namecoin.bitcoin-contact.org/</a>",1428751127

Largefiles make some tricks with storing the hash of file X in a .hglf/X file and folding it back in the right namespace is tricky and had some errors. Annotate and largefiles are conceptually incompatible; largefiles is intended for big and binary files where annotate wouldn&#x27;t work no matter what.<p>My experience is that the main problem with largefiles is the problem it is trying to solve. It is not a good idea to store large files in a VCS - especially not in a DVCS. Storing large files in VCS is last resort. Given a situation where you have to / want to do it anyway, largefiles is a fine solution. It works quite well for us and without significant problems.",1428750438

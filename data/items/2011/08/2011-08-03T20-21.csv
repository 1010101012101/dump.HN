Google would have had a huge stockpile of patents with which to countersue Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, the result being a cross-licensing deal where everyone goes back to actually making things.

It's this mismatch that has led to the current situation of companies competing in the courts instead of the marketplace.

2842967,comment,2841992,2841992,2,0,bg4,,,"I've worked in the trucking industry for the past six years and I find this article pretty accurate. However, all of the problems that this driver is faced with can be largely impacted by better decision making and planning on the company side. Then again, I'm heavily biased since this is exactly the type of software I work on every day.<p>We have products to help companies choose which freight to run to maximize profit (and which to get rid of), find optimal truck/order combinations to minimize cost/time of haul, to determine where the truck should buy fuel (and how much) for his current order to minimize fuel cost, and track the asset in near real time to ensure management knows when it will be late or off route (much easier to re-schedule the drop a day or two ahead, for example). We've even put considerable effort to optimize a swap of trailers between trucks on the road so that a driver can get home in an emergency.<p>I am unsure about the burden of fuel on the driver, as many of our carriers have fuel cards for drivers to purchase fuel (sometimes constrained to our locations/amounts to ensure compliance) and the company usually charges a fuel surcharge back to the customer anyways. I work with both very large and very small carriers but I obviously dont know the specifics of this drivers situation.<p>As far as the government involvement, the driver's hours of service are logged electronically because it was all too common for drivers to carry multiple log books (and use the one which allowed them to keep driving to make a drop). Electronic logging is a good thing. Personally, I think 11 hours behind the wheel of a 45,000lb semi-truck is probably enough for one day. Incidentally, they can drive 11 hours per day up to 70 hours total before they have to take 34 hours off in a row.<p>Hauling freight isn't easy and they deserve some respect.  Our Nation would crawl to a halt in a matter of days if they stopped doing their jobs.  Try to cut them a little more slack and room on the road.",1312404095

It's acceptable until you whack several kernels and OS' on a machine, all running lots of processes at which point everything suffers.  Cache locality goes AWOL, cache utilisation is shared, bus traffic goes up, so does latency and performance suddenly plummets.<p>3. It depends on the environment.  Virtualenv just provides a consistent python software environment which can be isolated from everything else on the machine.  As for other things: Look at FreeBSD's jails - that's as far as it should go[1].  Linux has ulimit and decent security.

Insurance rates doubled in one year in BC almost entirely because of one kind of accident.  Two cars are side by side, with the one on the left driven by a Canadian.  A Chinese immigrant from Hong Kong is behind the two.  The immigrant sees the opportunity, cuts over, and zooms past leaving the Canadian less than 6 inches of room.  The Canadian freaks out, turns the wheel right to avoid what feels like a certain collision, and hits the car next to him.<p>All drivers in question drove in complete accord with the rules of the road and common driving practices where they grew up.  It was all just a (very expensive) cultural misunderstanding.<p>Anyways Vancouver with something like a million people absorbed something like 80,000 immigrants from Hong Kong in the 1990s who didn't want to be there for the Chinese handover, and they brought a very aggressive driving style with them.

""Another test, maybe closer to reality: open many tabs, close half of them, open many new tabs, close half of them, etc And see how your memory gets lost, until you finally have to kill the Firefox process to get it back, so you can open other applications.""<p>And many others that mention that firefox can't handle being left on for days without breaking. I have hundreds of tabs in chrome for weeks at a time, sometimes probably longer but every now and then I feel like letting it update... (although it is a pain to start it with hundreds of tabs and I often get blocked from HN after I start chrome (guess I trigger some dos-filter ;P).<p>Also, any browser that doesn't run flash in a separate process (that you can kill yourself) isn't usable at all (that is, if you have flash installed (flashblock only delays the inevitable)).

2842797,comment,2841992,2841992,1,0,gregatragenet,,,"Most of the anger I see at trucks (and truck-drivers) is just ignorance of the physical limitations on trucks. They are big, so the rules of inertia mean they take longer to speed up and slow down, and they have limited visibility on the sides. Often the stories I hear about people nearly run off the road by a truck begins with the car hovering in the truck's blind-spot. I've seen drivers pull in front of a truck and then slam on the brakes to make a turn, almost causing an accident with the slower-stopping truck. Or passing a truck on the right as it is making a wide right turn. Good way to become a subcompact-sandwich. My favorite is when a truck turns on it's signal to change lanes prompting the cars around him to quickly fill that lane in an effort to 'not be behind a truck'. Awesome to keep the truck from making his turn/exit guys.<p>If you have trucker-angst I suggest you go rent a large vehicle - like make a road-trip in an RV. It'll open your eyes on how poorly the cars around a large vehicle will accommodate you. And how what you thought of as 'bad truck driver behavior' may just be the physical limitations of the vehicle he's driving.",1312402028

The truck will sustain minor damage and the car will sustain heavy damage, possibly killing all the people inside.

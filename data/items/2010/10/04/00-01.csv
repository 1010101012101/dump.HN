I do not have a college degree and so far that hasn't been much of an issue with jobs in NYC.<p>I am currently making $110k, and have consistently increased in salary year after year as well as from job to job - but I am concerned I am slowly starting to reach my upper limit on how much I will be able to earn as simply a developer - am I wrong in assuming this?

Basically, as was learned in the early 2000's, don't take a job for the options. And as an investor, assume that you might not always have the control and input you start off with when you make that major investment. It is fine to invest your time and energy into a company (and your money if you want to go that route), but know that any company is a gamble, and it is business, not personal. It's fine to be enthusiastic and love your work and your job, in fact that's the goal, but you'll eventually get burned if you think the people you work for really think of you as family, even if they tell that to you (unless they really are family).",1286153340

Do the weak law of large numbers as an easy exercise.  Cover the martingale convergence theorem (I like Breiman here) and use it to give the nicest proof of the strong law of large numbers.  Cover the ergodic theorem (Garcia's proof) and its (astounding) application to Poincare recurrence.  Cover the law of the iterated logarithm and its (astounding) application to the growth of Brownian motion.<p>Of course apply the Radon-Nikodym theorem and conditioning to sufficient statistics and note that order statistics are always sufficient.  Show that sample mean and variance are sufficient for i.i.d.  Gaussian samples and extend to the exponential family.<p>Give yourself an exercise:  In Papa Rudin, just after the Radon-Nikodym theorem, note the Hahn decomposition and use it to give a quite general proof of the Neyman-Pearson lemma.<p>To appreciate the law of large numbers in statistics, read the classic Halmos paper on minimum variance, unbiased estimation.<p>For tools for research in statistics, might want to get going in stochastic processes.  So, for elementary books, look for authors Karlin, Taylor, and Cinlar and touch on some applications, e.g., Wiener filtering and power spectral estimation.

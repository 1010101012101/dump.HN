Because GoDaddy is private, its strategy to dominate by size and market share alone is kinda evil.  How this company has managed to stay private for so long while getting so big and controlling so much bandwidth -- now this would be an interesting case study.<p><i>A lot of domainers don&#x27;t use GoDaddy and don&#x27;t want to put their domain names there.

I&#x27;ve ridden past that intersection probably close to 200 times (used to do repeats of OLH and coming down 84 is safer and more fun); as far as Skyline goes, it&#x27;s a very safe stretch of road.<p>How does the fact that she previously traveled that stretch at a reasonable 36mph contribute to the discussion? If the point is to determine her guilt, it misses the mark. It does, however, come off as insensitive to the deceased.<p>In any case, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of analysis on braking times/distance vs speed.  To this I will just add that I have a number of friends who have been taken out by vehicles suddenly turning in front of them -- it is one of the great dangers of riding.  As to why that happens, it&#x27;s typically either: the driver failed to account for the cyclist&#x27;s speed, or failed to notice the cyclist.<p>And as for Skyline, there are a number of factors that make it a dangerous road to be on.  One is the large number of car and motorcycle enthusiasts who drive its length at reckless speeds (doesn&#x27;t seem a factor here, but motorist deaths are extremely common on Skyline).  Another is the high contrast lighting conditions the trees paint on the road -- something I always worry about when I ride that road for any sizeable stretch.<p>To be honest, speed is your friend up there.

Another innovative idea being taken forward is the sharing of &#x27;anonymised&#x27; information collected at Accident and Emergency (A & E) departments in hospitals concerning the incidence of violence and use of weapons at particular geographical &#x27;hotspots&#x27; so that police can track violence trends and take preventative measures. Many victims of violence do not report the crime to the police but do attend at A & E with their injuries. The National Violence Surveillance Network established by the Cardiff University Violence Research Group in England and Wales found that such measures led to decreased numbers of wounded victims attending A & E as a result of violence and a decrease in serious assaults reported to the police.

On the way I point out the fact that deceptive signaling is often performed by a team of people, and many of the team members or employees actively work on such things despite having to grapple with moral reservations, and I talk about that for a bit, and point out they are not really innocent, but are acting primarily out of self interest.<p>Next, I talk about how many or most of the major problems in the world are due to resources being wasted because someone calculates that they can benefit more by using those resources to engage in deceptive signaling than by helping people, and they have many accomplices that recognize what is happening but assist anyway.<p>Finally, I point out that this is likely a dominant strategy, so there is almost no way to become powerful or remain in power except by engaging in such activities (using available resources in the way that maximizes power rather than any other consideration, such as preventing starvation), and I close by expressing my regret that this is so.",1379640796

6415476,comment,6411101,6411101,5,0,gruseom,,,"There&#x27;s a problem with language productivity comparisons that Armstrong mentions: it&#x27;s impossible to write the same program in two different languages. If you have the same team write it, their second try will benefit from everything they learned the first time, and that is so huge a part of programming that it is sure to distort the outcome and may even dwarf any language effects. But if you use different teams instead, you&#x27;ve traded one confounding variable for anotherthe effect of switching teamswhich is also hugely influential. Thus it&#x27;s impossible to do an apples-to-apples comparison, and most such experiments deserve high skepticism. It&#x27;s too easy to consciously or unconsicously engineer the outcome you expect, which is presumably why we nearly always hear that the experimenter&#x27;s pet language won the day. Has the experimenter&#x27;s pet language ever <i>not</i> won the day?<p>That makes me think of a more modest way to do these experiments that might return more reliable results: use the same team twice, but have them solve the problem in their favorite language first. That is, if A is the pet language and you want to compare A to B, write the program first in A and then in B. This biases the test in B&#x27;s favour, because A will get penalized for all the time it took to learn about the problem while B will get all that benefit for free. Since there&#x27;s already a major bias in favor of A, this levels the playing field some.<p>Here&#x27;s why I think this might be more reliable. If you run the experiment this way and A comes out much better, you now have an answer to the charge that the second time was easier: all that benefit went to B and B still lost. Conversely, if A doesn&#x27;t come out much better, you now have evidence that the language effect isn&#x27;t so great once you account for the learning effect.",1379640731

Typically, your client makes a single TCP connection for HTTP communication, all data requested on that connection is communicated on that connection. With a supporting server, multiple TCP connections can be used for the same HTTP connection. This doesn&#x27;t help with transfer speed, but it improves TCP&#x27;s ability to route around failure. One of your multiple TCP connections goes out, and another one (presumably on a different route) continues handling data transfer. With regular old TCP, the connection tends to fail and has to be re-established.<p>Pointless Pontification: since TCP was designed to route around failure, multi-connection TCP sounds to me like an adaptation of technology to the &quot;demands of business.&quot; What I mean is network operators seem to want to centralize their networks to reduce costs instead of distributing them to make them robust, thus the technologists are attempting to work around this &quot;failure.&quot;",1379640181

Let&#x27;s just ignore the fact that this is a very hard reaction to do, even by fusion standards, and let&#x27;s just ignore how the energy comes out and deal with raw amounts. Let&#x27;s produce 1 mole of helium, which according to Wolfram Alpha, is .025 cubic meters of helium at standard temperature and pressure [1].<p>To produce that mole of helium, we need 4 moles of hydrogen. According to Wikipedia [2], 4 atoms of hydrogen combine to produce 26.7 MeV of energy. So the production of that 0.025 cubic meters of helium produces 26.7 MeV times Avogadro&#x27;s Number of energy, which Google [3] conveniently converts to Joules for us without asking: 2.6  10e12 joules.<p>Wikipedia [4] says annual hydrogen consumption was 15 million kilograms per year in 2000. Let&#x27;s roll with that, because whynot. Helium&#x27;s atomic mass is 4.003, let&#x27;s just call it 4, so the number we just ran in Joules was for 4 grams. So we have to multiple that Joule count by 3,750,000,000, yielding 9.75  10e22Joules of excess energy to produce the world&#x27;s helium use for 2000. Human energy consumption in 2000 (because why not stay consistent) was 117.687 petawatthours, which is 4.23  10e20 joules.<p>So, to produce the amount of helium we used in 2000, if I&#x27;ve got all my numbers correct (and it&#x27;s been a while, but the tools I&#x27;m using here handle units automatically so that&#x27;s a plus for my chances of being right), would produce as a byproduct approximately ~230 times the amount of energy humans consumed in that year.<p>That&#x27;s actually enough energy to be a serious problem, even before we discuss the fact that it comes out as positrons and gamma rays. (And neutrinos, but that&#x27;s not a problem.)<p>In conclusion, we are not about to start producing helium from fusion, even if we could.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=volume+of+1+mole+of+helium+at+STP+in+cubic+meters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=volume+of+1+mole+of+hel...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star#Nuclear_fusion_reaction_pathways"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star#Nuclear_fusion_reaction_pa...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=26.7+MeV+times+Avogadro&#x27;s+number"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=26.7+MeV+times+Avogadro&#x27;s+nu...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium</a>",1379639851

The problem is that no 238Pu has been produced in the United States since the Department of Energy (DOE) shut down those facilities in the late 1980s. Since then, the U.S. space program has had to rely on the inventory of 238Pu that existed at that time, supplemented by the purchase of 238Pu from Russia. However, Russian facilities to produce 238Pu were also shut down many years ago, and the DOE will soon take delivery of its last shipment of 238Pu from Russia. The committee does not believe that there is any additional 238Pu (or any operational 238Pu production facilities) available anywhere in the world.<p>Full details are in &quot;Radioisotope Power Systems: An Imperative for Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Space Exploration&quot;, National Research Council committee report.

They&#x27;re kind of pushed it away by some of the rules they&#x27;ve added.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure they&#x27;re making most of their money off of technology. Look at KS&#x27;s &#x27;Most Funded&#x27; page [1]. Sure, the projects about delivering A Tech Toy are generally making more. The Pebble&#x27;s the only thing to break 10,000k. But scroll down a bit and the highest movie made 5,000k.<p>In fact, if you go look at the stats on their page summing up 2012[2], &#x27;technology&#x27; is #5. Behind games, film/video, design, and music. What would happen if KS dropped the tech category? Hell, let&#x27;s be aggressive and drop the game category too. All its big projects are pretty technical.<p>Games + tech pulled in $112,118k. People pledged $319,786k across all categories that year. So technology AND games pulled in about 1/3 of their pledges. Not too bad. But most of that was from games. Drop the gizmos, and they&#x27;re only dropping $29,000k in pledges. (KS takes 5% of all pledges, so that&#x27;s only about $1,450,000 out of $15,989k they&#x27;d be losing in terms of income.)<p>I think KS is doing the exact opposite of a pivot: the market found a use for their idea they didn&#x27;t like, and instead of rebuilding things to make that easier, they&#x27;re digging in their heels and insisting that it should only be used their way. Which is often a recipe for disaster, but not in the case of Kickstarter - it&#x27;s clear there&#x27;s a pretty good revenue stream solely in being the man in the middle of crowd-sourced art grants.

My guess, is that most cyclists stay well under the &#x27;thrown over&#x27; threshold when braking, which could be part of the reason some collisions occur (i.e. too little, too late sort of thing).  An automated system could probably get you right up to that threshold, and then use gyros for stabilization (to balance the bike).  The reason that this won&#x27;t happen is because no one is going to install this on their bike (whereas most modern cars already have fairly sophisticated on board computers and sensor systems).",1379639240

6415382,comment,6414162,6415286,4,0,BruceIV,,,"And my point was that, due to the way C++ is designed (specifically, not having a proper module system and having this massively powerful macro-replacement templating engine), there is no way for the compiler to distinguish between &quot;legacy&quot; code and &quot;new&quot; code.<p>Consider the following case study: you have a library including a template class that uses raw pointers as an iterator type. You accidentally write `iter + 9` instead of `*iter + 9` when you&#x27;ve included it (this will likely compile, though there should be a warning). Now, even assuming there&#x27;s some language extension added to mark that library as &quot;legacy&quot; (maybe #include-legacy <mylibrary>), can you tell me whether the &quot;new&quot; code you just wrote using raw pointers counts as &quot;legacy&quot; or not?<p>I think this is basically Bartosz&#x27; point as well - that C++&#x27;s legacy design features are too baked in to make positive changes easily, or even tractably (even small changes like your --no-legacy compiler flag).",1379639186
6415381,comment,6414162,6415179,5,0,chetanahuja,,," That conclusion on squandering the power of new hardware is being backed by absolutely zero data and is obviously false. Just look around you and note how much software you depend on runs in a parallel fashion on multicore systems (using the SMP model of programming) and  is written in imperative languages (mostly C and C++).<p>The only arguments presented by the author are his own subjective opinions of how bad various features of C++ are. There&#x27;s merit in many of his arguments but the effect of each problem is exaggerated way beyond it&#x27;s actual impact. For example, the bold, unhedged claim:<p><i>&quot;Two words: data races. Imperative languages offer no protection against data races  maybe with the exception of D.&quot;</i><p>is a ridiculous claim to make right after his (mostly dismissive) nod to memory model and synchronization primitive introduced in c++11. If it was that difficult to implement parallel programming in imperative languages, we&#x27;d have to scrap every OS kernel (which pretty much all scale to large number of cores today) and every hosted language environment (which are all ultimately written in C/C++) and rewrite them in Haskell.<p>Careful readers (who read the references at the bottom of the article) will note the author clearly has an agenda having to do with more automated resource management in C++. For whatever reasons, it has not found it&#x27;s way into the standard until now and in his frustration, he&#x27;s lashing out at not just C++ but basically the entire installed base of computer technology (mostly built on top of imperative, manually memory managed languages like C and C++).",1379639183

A road bike with 23c tires and caliper breaks has a completely different stopping power than a mountain bike with 2.1 tires and disc brakes. In an emergency breaking the former would lock the rear wheel and/or lose the front of the bike (rider would fall to the side), whereas the latter would have much better control with reduced wheel locking. From my own experience, stopping a road bike at ~40mph in around 100ft is an optimistic estimate, specially if you are going downhill.",1379639065

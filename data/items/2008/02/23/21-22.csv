Currently it seems I'm practicing sort of free-running sleep... going to bed between 4am and 8am, waking up between 11am and 2pm...<p>Polyphasic sleep seems well suited for people in early stages of a startup, with very little external commitments... though that may change if it gets to the point of hiring additional employees, seeking funding, etc.<p>Pure polyphasic sleeping seems a little extreme to me since the days would end up blending together I think I might go crazy. But the everyman schedule is appealing because you still get a few solid hours of sleep to clearly delineate days.",1203803896

122225,comment,121137,121418,0,0,mightybyte,,,"From my previous paragraph:<p>'The kids can now say, ""I don't have to assign more value to green legos just because your game assigns more points to them."" Some things still do have a certain degree of intrinsic value, so this won't always work. But they have been empowered to the extent allowed by the value assignments of which that they have control.'<p>By understanding when value is more subjective versus intrinsic, founders can choose to work on something where the value is more intrinsic.  And if there's nothing with true intrinsic value, then they at least look for things where more people are likely assign value.  Founders probably don't really think about it like this, they just look for something that people want.  But it can't hurt to understand the characteristics of value at this lower level.  If you can consistently find, create, or buy value, getting rich isn't too hard.",1203803798

Forget marketing, addictiveness, virality. Figure out what is the core value you want to provide to users and just focus on that the hardest. Make your product the absolute best that can be.<p>Within your product, do the most important thing your users need or you think your users need. (The former is better if you have a significant user base.) If that thing is billing, do it, else postpone it. Don't think about what will cause a media splash, or what is ""cool"". Stay focused on what people want.<p>If you have been live / launched for quite some time, marketing, addictiveness and virality become somewhat more important, but from your question, I suspect that isn't yet the case.",1203802866

It sounds far more complicated than it is.<p>Here's an example sheet that you should be able to copy via Google's menu:<p><a href=""http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pvOwoUYoNUFTmGZhwyjK4OA&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pvOwoUYoNUFTmGZhwyjK4...</a><p>Having used this specific approach on many projects, there's  considerations that should be kept in mind that I haven't solved 100%:<p>It's difficult to track dependencies between tasks and have those sort efficiently. As a human you have to realize the sheet is a tool and that you have to look to catch these things from time-to-time.<p>If you're not careful, you can defer 'infrastructure' tasks that have no obvious/direct BV. I work around this by temporarily having infrastructure tasks inherit the combined BV of all things that they'll help and for all tasks to add the infrastructure item's cost to theirs.<p>There's probably a more accurate formula for dependents and dependencies to use, but I find that if you have 99 tasks dependent on an infrastructure task, it's not unreasonable to say that task is pretty durned important to open 'doors' for the company.<p>For example, refactoring tasks often fall into this category. Changing from an Access database backend to a MySQL backend might not give you immediate ROI, but the sheer number of things that open up to you as possibilities after that need to be considered somehow. The conventional naive approach might not get you there without the item inheriting some of the value.",1203802784

122203,comment,122121,122121,0,0,thorax,,,"I'll start by saying I'm a weird guy.<p>A long time ago I realized that people mean different things when they say 'priority'. If you only mean the 'value' of a certain task, then that's not a good way to prioritize, IMHO.<p>I've changed my model to prioritize strictly according to return on investment. I.e., how much value I or the company receives for unit of work.<p>In my professional project management and in my company, here's the algorithm that I pretty much use for every sort of task prioritization:<p>(1) I put together a list of items<p>(2) I put a relative cost (RC or C) associated with each item-- for a task list this tends just to be the hours you predict you'll spend.<p>(3) I hide those costs and then add some number that represents the relative business value (RBV or BV) of each item. (More on this in a second)<p>(4) I unhide things and then put another column that just calculates RBV/RC which indicates the return on investment (ROI) for each task.<p>(5) I then sort it all by ROI and work my way down the list in ROI priority order, always working on the tasks that offer the most ROI, I adjust values and costs (and re-sort) as my needs change, work completes, and as my understanding of each task changes.<p>The units used to value each assigned task is not really important. It's only important that tasks have a value that makes sense relative to each other.<p>For example, if I have these tasks:<p><pre><code>  * Setup tech support email account\n  * Improve usability for site logon page\n  * Write a blog article about our recent features\n</code></pre>\nI might then give these costs:<p><pre><code>     01 hour  - Write a blog article about our recent features\n     01 hour  - Setup tech support email account\n     16 hours - Improve usability for site logon page\n</code></pre>\nHaving a tech support email account, I know that's important and I must have it, so it gets a high value. In this case, I'd say ""Improving usability"" is something we could survive without, but I firmly believe it could increase our revenue.<p>I might then give these relative business values (I'll just say points):<p><pre><code>      200 pts - Write a blog article about our recent features\n    10000 pts - Setup tech support email account\n     5000 pts - Improve usability for site logon page\n</code></pre>\nWhen I calculate the ROI and sort them, I get this list that I work from top to bottom:<p><pre><code>    10000 pts/h - Setup tech support email account\n      313 pts/h - Improve usability for site logon page\n      200 pts/h - Write a blog article about our recent features\n\n</code></pre>\nAs long as when I add new tasks, I evaluate them against the other values and costs to ensure they're all relatively correct, the list always sorts to provide the tasks with the 'biggest bang for the buck' at the top.",1203801212

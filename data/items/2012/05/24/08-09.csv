I hope this will change soon as Firefox rolls out the new tab page. It would be nice to have something similar to Chrome with a page you can scroll across to for extensions.<p>I'm still confused as to why this made you switch, however, as I'm sure you're capable of installing addons in either browser. Still, each to their own :-)",1337849921

I think that non-commercial distributed but at the same time more private content oriented networking will become a big thing within the next decade or so, and that network will be even more difficult for commercial interests to take advantage of.  And it won't be hosted on a giant commercial centralized system.<p>Beyond the private distributed social/content networks etc., you will see artificial general intelligence that blows Google's gmail parsing and everything else out of the water.  I believe that personal data and conversations will generally be stored more privately and that people will voluntarily take advantage of these AIs (AGIs) to act as agents and assistants.<p>I also think that these powerful artificial general intelligences are going to put the nail in the coffin for the current infinite growth consumer driven ""economic"" model, which will be replaced by a more sophisticated and humane descendant.",1337849763

Haberman has effectively said ""we won't discuss the merits of the piece, but I'm still going to score a political point at the article's expense"". It's a bit like when Ebert said ""Games aren't art, and there is nothing more to discuss"". Either make your point and allow discussion, or avoid discussion. Saying 'you can't make your point but I can make mine' is hypocritical.<p>Also, the two comments I equate are the same in essence - both refuse to discuss the item citing poor quality. There is no real criticism in it, because there is no actual discussion of the merits. Where is the subtlety? What I'm pointing out is that his blanket shut-out without discussion is actually an offensive tactic - one I personally find more offensive than Torvald's direct 'that idea is stupid' style.",1337849575

4017457,comment,4010868,4012358,2,0,kelnos,,,"Gah, sorry, I didn't get the feeling that that's what you were referring to, though, since it felt like you were implying that ObjC has had this feature for a long time (which it hasn't), and this is something C++ has just gotten (which it has).<p>I'm still not convinced that the standard data structures in ObjC are now really ""a part of the language"", though the distinction may be meaningless and just me splitting hairs.<p>For instance, take NSString and the @""foo"" literal syntax.  With GNU gcc (not sure about Apple gcc), you can pass -fconstant-string-class=X to the compiler, and actually replace NSString (well, actually NSConstantString or NXConstantString, depending on if you're using the GNU or NeXT runtime) with another class to represent string literals (I assume it has to have the same memory layout).<p>So I wonder if they're doing something similar with NSArray and NSDictionary.  Are those particular classes actually a part of the language, or is just the concept of an array/vector and dict/map a part of the language, and it can be mapped to some arbitrary class with a particular memory layout using new syntactic sugar.<p>Also telling is that you can't initialize globals/static globals with the new array/dict syntax.  That implies to me that the compiler isn't actually generating an ObjC class in rodata, but is instead taking the new syntax and transforming it (I hesitate to say ""preprocessing"") by emitting code for the corresponding initializer method call (or <i>something</i> not entirely unlike that).<p>But I guess in the end it mostly doesn't matter how it works under the hood: as long as the syntax is there, and the compiler can generate useful warnings/errors when you make mistakes, it might as well be a part of the language.<p>(Also, thanks for the info on C++11; I didn't realize the new STL container intializers had made it in.  I'm mostly a C++-hater, but good to know nonetheless.)",1337849373

Each person stores encrypted their contacts routing information.  You can direct-message (server-less) if the person is online, or if not, send it encrypted to others who are online, and when the person logs in, it's routed on to them.  You could do micro-blogging like this, where messages pulse out to two or three degrees of separation, and only if they are validated (i.e. liked), do they push on further.

Don't send a resume - That's a huge statement and your supporting points are severely lacking in elaboration. <i>listing all the different languages you know is really only interesting to you and your peers</i> Refer to my first point above.<p>2.

Show youre interested in the product, and the process - <i>if you could show that youre interested in the business and arent going to leave when the next startup comes calling, thats great</i> That's one of the many reasons to interview someone. It's an opportunity to find out how much they truly know about you and your company. If you think you can derive this from an initial application, then again, I feel you are misguided.<p>6. Have a good answer for why youre leaving your current job - <i>This wont be in the initial email, but is important, so I had to include it</i> This should be in the initial email. This is always one of the first questions I ask prior to interviewing someone. If they tell me the reason they want out is because they are bored, then the obvious next question is 'why do you find it boring'.<p>This article should be titled <i>How to make life easier for a non-technical hiring manager</i> as I can almost guarantee your approach will contradict the thought process of most decision makers within the tech start-up community as opposed to getting a job offer from 'every company they apply to'.<p>Sorry to be so scathing as there are some useful pieces of info in your article however the title angered me.",1337849079

Additional and more precise maneuvers will be tested tomorrow before the docking takes place.<p>Due to the vaccuum of space, firing the rocket engines (a ""burn"") is required for any change in direction (the effects of gravity nonwithstanding). The burns we are looking at right now are to move the Dragon capsule closer to the ISS in the vertical dimension: First one burn to accellerate it upwards towards the ISS, and then a second burn to level it off and stop moving upwards.

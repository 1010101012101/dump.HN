However, reading this article reminded me that Filezilla was actually still installed on that box, just not in use, so I decided to uninstall it while it was on my mind. Immediately after uninstalling it, it tried to force a shutdown on my computer. The only reason I was able to stop it was because I had a process running in the background that wouldn&#x27;t terminate and I was given the choice by Windows to force shutdown or cancel.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve only ever installed it from ninite.com[2], so I know it didn&#x27;t initially have the Sourceforge trojan/adware junk. However, I&#x27;ve since allowed it to download its own updates instead of doing it manually through the Ninite downloader. I&#x27;ve never, ever seen a program I&#x27;ve uninstalled via the Windows Control Panel with the ability to force a shutdown or restart without first notifying me or giving me the option to postpone. I&#x27;m starting to think there&#x27;s something nefarious in Filezilla itself, perhaps in one of those &quot;direct from the developer&quot; updates, not just the Sourceforge wrapper.<p>Another interesting thing is that the built in Filezilla updater will first uninstall the app before reinstalling the updated version, and it never tried to restart or shutdown the computer during those updates, only during uninstallation from the Control Panel.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.h...</a><p>[2] Ninite strips out any malware or other crap from the installer and only installs the pure program with default settings, in the background, and sources the app directly from the developer&#x27;s site when possible.

So you put all of your state in your relational stateful database and forget that this part exists in your universe. Of course theoretically you could model your knowledge as a function based off the state of the universe, but you don&#x27;t have budget to do that. You write comments about quick hacks to get around purity constraints. The hacks are never removed and you end up passing stateful maps of database tables around.

Something may well be formally simple but at the same time incompatible with human cognition. Indeed, that may not be objective, but since when do we value things only by objective measures? That the only <i>objective</i> measure of simplicity may be the size of formal semantics does not mean that it is the most <i>useful</i> measure of simplicity (if we wish to view simplicity as possessing a positive value that implies ease of understanding).",1449140850

The garbage collection and overall elimination of the need for allocating and freeing memory also contributes to this; no longer do you have to understand the resource life-cycle strategy of some C library you&#x27;ve decided to use, or if it&#x27;s using the C library&#x27;s allocator or its own, or if it&#x27;s capable of using your allocator via some elaborate and unique initialization scheme.<p>Unfortunately Golang&#x27;s concurrent execution model is also what makes it a pretty terrible language for system programming.  Golang&#x27;s inescapable and largely opaque underlying use of threads is a constant source of pain for anyone programming operating system facilities which influence only the calling thread&#x27;s state, particularly state inherited by child threads.<p>I often encounter misuse of runtime.LockOSThread() in attempts to overcome this problem but as of now this is completely inadequate because the Go scheduler creates new OS threads on an as-needed basis from whichever currently-executing OS thread happens to be executing at the time.  This leaks whatever unique state the thread may have into a newly created, unlocked OS thread, which may then go execute any goroutine - likely the very thing you were attempting to prevent in using runtime.LockOSThread().<p>There&#x27;s plenty more to whine about, but I&#x27;ll stop here.",1449140845

Metal hasn&#x27;t been cut yet. No survey strategy exists, it&#x27;s too early for that.<p>The problem is not that the telescope wouldn&#x27;t work anywhere else but that it&#x27;s really too late in the day to be making such changes. A change in site will set the telescope back about 5 or more years, they will have to start site selection again because their other location choice is now taken by another telescope. All the other sites surveyed were in Hawaii. There is nowhere else in the US of this quality. A new site will also likely cost much more as few are developed. So the telescope will lose at least 5 years on it&#x27;s competitors and all the cost of starting again and keeping everyone employed 5 more years. It may well miss out on key work in that time, it will probably loose the ability to do joint observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.<p>So even if it moved it will come much later than the larger European telescope and may have to be scaled back in performance after all the cash it will waste in the site swap. It may loose out on some early science or some science cases altogether if downsized. The real problem is it may not survive the change. Some countries currently signed up will decide to withdraw and back other projects which can be delivered on time. It may be that the cost of the change is large and too many people leave to continue the project. That is not some hypothetical, projects like this which lose momentum often fail. More money could be found but that&#x27;s unlikely.<p>If it cannot be built here the whole project is seriously at risk and it will sacrifice science considerably even if it does survive.",1449140681

The rest of the book follows the traditional progression (scanner, parser, type checking, IR generation, etc.)  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, which is my only reservation when recommending it for a university class (although students are resourceful if you know what I mean ;))<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Crafting-Compiler-Charles-N-Fischer/dp/0136067050"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.ca/Crafting-Compiler-Charles-N-Fischer/dp/...</a>",1450119554

They&#x27;ve got a &quot;model&quot; that turns over the portfolio 1.5 times a year, backtested since around 2000. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get people to understand that what they&#x27;re doing is totally crazy.<p>What the article is hinting at is a very specific part of the scientific method: mechanism.<p>When you hypothesise about something, you are also guessing at how exactly the effect comes to pass. So for instance you surmise that incident radiation induces a current in conductors, lessening the amount of radiation beyond the point of incidence. This mechanism would have some interesting experimental results, namely that non conductors would not shield anything, whereas conductors can be used to shield say a phone from EM radiation. It also means if your shield was conducting but very thin, it might not work.<p>In the financial sphere, you rarely have the luxury of being able to test mechanisms. There&#x27;s a huge amount of data, and it&#x27;s quite easy to find structure, but the apparatus itself is rarely exposed.<p>This leaves you with two areas of research: arbitrage, as in what Chollida1 says, and presumed mechanisms.<p>Since the first area has been explored by him, I&#x27;ll look at the second.<p>So let&#x27;s say you used to work in a large pension fund, and that pension fund always did its trades starting at 3pm, and filled whatever wasn&#x27;t done in the auction. You meet some colleagues, who do the same. Since you now have a glimpse into a causal mechanism, it&#x27;s pretty reasonable for you to look at a model where things that have traded a lot since 3pm continue in the way they were going.<p>There could be lots of similar mechanisms in play, coming on and off as the market evolved.",1450119116

10732968,comment,10728880,10732467,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"No statistical method is impervious to malicious attempts to subvert it. That said, reasoning between two different models on the basis of <i>magnitude of t-stat</i> is <i>inherently</i> flawed. That is, such an inference process doesn&#x27;t possess the properties necessary to lead to the conclusions people try to draw from it, <i>even if no malicious intent is present</i>. When you add this to a situation where the temptation is high for things like p-hacking, it <i>actively encourages</i> poor statistical hygiene.<p>Whereas, with Bayesian statistics, you&#x27;d have to <i>go out of your way and do something that is glaringly fishy</i> to do the same thing. Hiding it from people is generally a lot harder than hiding what you&#x27;re doing with generic p-hacking.<p>One of the main reasons for this is that the model&#x27;s reliance upon assumptions is usually far more transparent in a Bayesian model. You are forced to publicly declare your dependence on assumptions encoded in the prior. In the frequentist case, many people <i>don&#x27;t even consider</i> that there are prior assumptions that may not hold about the data, and indeed they often report results which are incorrect because they did not account for basic things, like how their data is encoded, or non-ignorable experimental designs.<p>One of my favorite papers about this sort of thing is &quot;Let&#x27;s Put the Garbage-Can Regression and Garbage-Can Probits Where They Belong&quot; by Christopher Achen [1].<p>Of course, the same thing can happen in a Bayesian setting. Someone can use an off-the-shelf Bayesian model fitting tool without understanding what it is doing, and they could use standard prior distributions for analytical convenience or ease of coding, and then later try to package their result as some &quot;fancy Bayesian analysis&quot; when it really suffers from low stats quality just like the dumb t-stat comparison would have.<p>But it&#x27;s <i>harder</i> to do that in a Bayesian setting without it drawing a red flag (I guess, unless you just tell bald-faced lies about what code you wrote, but that&#x27;s a different story).<p>The bigger point is that you don&#x27;t trust just one thing. You don&#x27;t look at a single description of model fit or comparison, like two t-stats, and draw a conclusion. You should plot the residuals, make calibration plots, ROC curves, histograms of where your observations fall based on predicted outcome variables, etc. There is <i>never</i> any sort of cookie cutter approach that will tell you whether some backtest should be believed.<p>As for the usefulness of managing this stuff in the form of articulating priors, one quote I always liked was in response to a critcism of Bayesian methods&#x27; reliance on a prior, where some academic said something like &quot;So and so is standing on the front porch with a shotgun ready to shoot down any assumption that comes over the hill -- meanwhile, the back door is wide open for any assumption to run in.&quot;<p>If we set aside the fact that <i>any</i> statistics procedure can be misused, or can be reported upon without proper skepticism and due diligence, then I still <i>do</i> further believe that frequentism, in general as an entire epistemological half of statistics is simply a failed project, especially for any type of problem that is a <i>policy</i> problem, which inherently requires access to a posterior distribution conditioned on some information.<p>But, I don&#x27;t want to derail this thread and turn it into yet another philosophical debate about whether frequentism can be used as a basis for probability theory that corresponds with reality or not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.columbia.edu/~gjw10/achen04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbia.edu/~gjw10/achen04.pdf</a>",1450119091
10732967,comment,10728058,10731239,0,0,joesmo,,,"I too think the OO paradigm, at least as implemented in popular OO languages (mainly through classes and inheritance), has few benefits, though not necessarily none. Certainly the idea of modeling real world objects has failed miserably while still being taught to inexperienced developers who then make everything a descendant of a class like Thing (or some nonsense like that). On the other hand, interfaces (protocols in Clojure) are the one good idea that&#x27;s implemented in a lot of OO languages, though really that&#x27;s just part of a type system and not an OO concept.<p>The real problem comes from completely ignoring data structures. By mixing in functions with data, proper data structures are virtually nonexistent in the OO world and manipulating data properly becomes an exercise in frustration and working around the limitations of the OO implementation (data that should be together isn&#x27;t; data that shouldn&#x27;t be is; easy access to the data, etc.). In this regard, I&#x27;d say procedural programming is on roughly equal footing with functional programming in as much as they both tend to focus heavily on data structures first. As they say, show me your data structures and I don&#x27;t need to see the code; show me your code and I won&#x27;t know shit.<p>Your point that OO&#x27;s main advantage is popularity is spot on. It certainly is possible to build large, maintainable systems in an OO fashion, but it is very difficult and requires <i>a lot</i> of experience. That&#x27;s why there is so much terrible OO code out there. It&#x27;s virtually impossible to write decent code without <i>a lot</i> of experience.

I don&#x27;t have the 2015 numbers for medical schools, but in 2014, there were 18,000 graduates in the US[1].<p>Increasing the number of medical school graduates in the US would mean that a larger percentage of residency slots are taken by people who went to school in the US but not the total number of residents. Ironically, this would actually be a <i>bad</i> thing cost-wise, since foreign medical schools are usually cheaper and students carry a lower debt load[2].<p>>  Does this mean there is an ever-growing population of &quot;post-doc&quot; physicians, stuck in labs or other non-patient-facing situations?<p>Yes. You are likely to see them take jobs in industry - e.g. at a pharmaceutical or insurance company, but on the business side, since they&#x27;re not licensed to practice. (Nor are they even qualified - medical school teaches essential knowledge for doctors, but they receive basically no training on actual clinical practice. All of that happens during residency).<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that not all doctors want to practice medicine - for example, people in an MD/PhD program often go into research, and that&#x27;s a good thing. But if we&#x27;re talking about increasing the supply of practicing physicians, increasing the number of medical school applicants in the US makes literally zero difference.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nrmp.org/press-release-2015-residency-match-largest-on-record-with-more-than-41000-applicants-vying-for-over-30000-residency-positions-in-4756-programs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrmp.org/press-release-2015-residency-match-large...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.aamc.org/download/321532/data/factstable27-2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aamc.org/download/321532/data/factstable27-2.pdf</a><p>[2] These aren&#x27;t necessarily &quot;foreign&quot; students either; it&#x27;s quite common for people in the US to go to medical school in the Caribbean and then come back for their residency.",1450119010

10732896,comment,10730839,10730839,0,0,tikhonj,,,"Return statements and &quot;early exit&quot; are not built into functional languages. If the language, like Scheme, supports continuations, we can use callCC to implement an early return[1]:<p><pre><code>    (define (example x)\n      (call/cc (lambda (return)\n        (when (< x 0) (return #f))\n        ; more code, including possible more calls to return\n        0)))\n</code></pre>\nHowever, most functional languages do not have callCC built in. Happily we can get a similar effect by writing our code in continuation-passing style (CPS)[2]. (Think Node.js.)<p>Nominally, CPS has some overhead because of the extra function calls involved. However, a CPS transform also puts every call in <i>tail position</i>, making them eligible for tail call elimination. This means that we can use CPS with no function call overhead in a language with proper tail calls.<p>What does this mean in practice? It means that calling a callback in CPS style—which, being in tail position, can be eliminated—is effectively <i>just</i> a jump under the hood. Not too different from return!<p>Putting it all together, we get that tail call elimination lets us write code in continuation passing style with no extra over head which gives us access to continuations that we can use to implement an early return in languages <i>without</i> return.<p>This turns out to <i>not</i> be what the article was on about, but I think it&#x27;s more interesting.<p>[1]: Code from a StackOverflow answer by Nathan Shively-Sanders which goes into more detail: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2434294/scheme-early-short-circuit-return"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2434294/scheme-early-shor...</a><p>[2]: I wrote a brief explanation of CPS on Quora: <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-continuation-passing-style-in-functional-programming/answer/Tikhon-Jelvis?share=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/What-is-continuation-passing-style-in-...</a>",1450118558

On the one hand I totally empathized with his frustration/excitement at building a cool bit of software for himself. On the other hand I&#x27;ve never had problems managing my email inbox, mainly because I don&#x27;t get that much relevant email.<p>In particular, since the Gmail tab redesign I&#x27;ve not had an issue keeping my Inbox unread count at 0(though with my Promotions/Updates/Forums tab unread count in the who-knows-how-manies). I guess this confirms his point about email protocols being dinosaurs, since the way Gmail implements its tabs is tied into their client implementations and doesn&#x27;t work in other email clients.<p>The overall impression I ended up with was that Slate is simply using email for workflows it was never meant to support and is not very good at supporting. Email chains are not a good way to do project management/planning. It&#x27;s good that they&#x27;ve started using Slack for chat-like communication. They should adopt some sort of project management app to manage projects. If you&#x27;ve got a user that&#x27;s used to Gmail, they can learn Trello, for instance, in about an hour.<p>I tend to think about 3 levels of communication: chatting(text, audio, video); email; project related. Each level requiring additional structure and being a bit more cumbersome to use than the last when writing, but easier to use when reading/searching for information.<p>In that sense it makes sense to use 3 (sets of) tools for 3 different types of communication. The main downside is that it&#x27;s somewhat complicated to transfer a conversation from one channel to another. However doing all 3 in one application leads to the risk of making a simple use case too complicated or a complicated use case impossible.<p>The ideal integrated communication app would need to provide IRC-like chat power, Hangouts/Skype like chat simplicity(+audio/video support), Gmail like email usability and auto filtering, and more than Trello-like project management/collaboration tools(for instance, having Google Doc-style shared documents properly integrated into it). All usable in interfaces designed for the particular level of communication you are engaging it at the time, but allowing you to move &#x27;threads&#x27; of conversation up or down the hierarchy easily. I&#x27;ve not encountered anything that does this right. Heck just being able to properly integrate Gmail, hangouts chats and google docs/google doc comments between each other isn&#x27;t possible and all those are made by the same company.",1450118103

10732832,comment,10726832,10731250,0,0,amyjess,,,"This is going to vary wildly from game to game. The short verison is that a lot of games actually keep most of their content outside the EXE. This includes most of the actual gameplay: often, the EXE just contains the engine, and everything that makes the game the game is loaded from other files.<p>How easy this content is to access is going to vary wildly from game to game.<p>A lot of games stuff it in an undocumented binary format. Reverse-engineering that is often a pain in the ass, but typically once somebody pulls it off, they&#x27;ll release tools to make modding easier. If you&#x27;re lucky and the developer encourages modding, then they might even release official tools.<p>Other games store it in plain text files using a consistent scripting language. Really nice developers, such as Paradox, will even officially document the API. Actually, Paradox is one of my favorite developers for this: in addition to documenting everything, their scripting language is an easy-to-parse declarative language that mostly consists of nested key-value pairs.<p>Art assets, regardless of the game, are often in common industry formats that are readable by various existing editors. This can be good or bad: some of these formats require very expensive editors to read the art assets (e.g. 3DS MAX). Music assets use common formats, too: for example, a lot of small companies will just use Vorbis files because they don&#x27;t want to pay royalties.<p>Unfortunately, if you&#x27;re dealing with one of the few games that stuffs everything in the EXE, modding is very difficult and typically requires hacking the EXE with a hex editor. With modern games, this is virtually impossible more often than not (especially with DRM involved). With classic games, it&#x27;s much easier. For example, it&#x27;s fairly easy to mod most 8-bit and 16-bit console games by opening the ROM in a hex editor: most of the classic games have been thoroughly reverse-engineered and documented by modders, and there&#x27;s a colossal wealth of resources available. With many games, there are even programs to make the process easier. Some of the <i>really</i> advanced modders will just disassemble the ROM, modify the ASM code as needed (most 8-bit and 16-bit console games were originally written in ASM to begin with, so this isn&#x27;t as hard as it sounds), and then reassemble it.",1450118038

Never to read the &quot;what&#x27;s new&quot;. It makes me feel depressed. It has become a space of self admiration, where everyone is so perfect, so happy, so successful, traveling the world, meeting new fascinating people, partying and making out with hot chicks. It&#x27;s a fantasy world that hits some structures in your brain hundreds of times more powerfully than tv commercials.<p>I have the luxury of studying humanities (getting another degree) and not programming anymore for work. That&#x27;s an absolutely great situation. I can learn useless languages, outdated technologies and not worry about deadlines. Programming is a nice break from reading medieval sources on development of mysticism.<p>You say: &quot;overwhelmed or frustrated or worried?&quot;. My perspective is different. Of course there are some people who will make a handsome passive income, or become very successful and earn shitloads of money. But it&#x27;s more the matter of luck, like winning a lottery, rather than of consistently working towards your goal. Success seems random, chaotic at best. And HN has a very high concentration of people obsessed with success stories.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in IT anymore - unlike many people here do.

They are wasting my time and their money. But still I am a consumer nevertheless and have my 500 euros to squander. The ads I stumble upon have NEVER tempted me to click on them. They are perfectly irrelevant. Or I get ads of products I have already bought. Pointless, don&#x27;t you think?<p>There are web sites that take 10-15 seconds to load, then my laptop starts to roar, gets boiling hot executing Flash and JS. That&#x27;s an absurd!<p>For me what&#x27;s going on in the IT world is just a tech bubble. Nothing to be frustrated or worried about.<p>And there are millions of things we have to fix in the world (I live in Scandinavia.

And you want an intelligent Deep Learning algorithm. We are still struggling with providing drinking water to a large percentage of humanity.<p>So the wonderful things presented over here are not really revolutionizing anything. They are mostly admirable toys, but let&#x27;s not be too crazy about them.<p>PS: My friend&#x27;s laptop has broken and since then he goes to the library, reads 3 books a week, takes notes.

I&#x27;ve also observed this issue to be worse in environments when success or failure is difficult to measure (or is only measurable far in to the future).<p>And I very much agree with your last paragraph: good managers and leaders are people who recognise competence and use it to further an organisation&#x27;s goals. I don&#x27;t mean that in the &quot;take credit for your subordinate&#x27;s idea&quot; kind of way, as that&#x27;s clearly an unsustainable strategy (the uncredited start withholding information and ideas, eventually).<p>On the game theory/evolutionarily stable strategy side of things though, I think it depends on context and perspective. If the context is one with a ubiquity of good managers, the pay-off for &#x27;unjustified confidence&#x27; is probably pretty low or even negative. Also, as this is a multi-round game, the pay-off for &#x27;unjustified confidence&#x27; gets lower and lower with each successive round (as good managers will factor past experience into their estimation of subordinate competence).<p>On the flip side, in a context with mostly incompetent managers, I&#x27;d agree the dominant strategy for individuals, competent and incompetent alike, is to &#x27;act confident&#x27;. Although, as mentioned before, the competent are hobbled by the dunning-kruger effect here. Even if they weren&#x27;t (i.e. competent and incompetent subordinates display equal levels of confidence), the outcome for the organisation would be indistinguishable from random decision making. In other words, you could replace managers with a coin (or a n-sided die, for problems with n possible solutions). And you don&#x27;t have to pay coins or dice six figure salaries, making it the better option...<p>From the organisation&#x27;s perspective, it seems crazy to rely on getting the competent people to &#x27;be more confident&#x27;. In fact, it seems impossible. If your organisation needs to rely on &#x27;confidence&#x27; to determine who is competent, then by definition it cannot directly discern which employees are competent. So how would it know which employees to encourage to be &#x27;more confident&#x27;? This seems to reduce back to the &#x27;(at best) random decision making&#x27; outcome in the previous paragraph.<p>Funnily enough, if you factor in the dunning-kruger effect, in the &#x27;bad managers&#x27; context the best way to make decisions (on average) would be to follow the advice of the &#x27;least confident sounding&#x27; employees.<p>The only viable (albeit less hilarious) solution from the organisation&#x27;s perspective (and therefore dominant strategy) is to try very hard to only hire competent leaders and managers.",1450117639

If problems in the domain have binary solutions and no external input, a good measure of quality is average time to solution. Sometimes, you can get a benefit by batching the problems, so lets permit that. In other cases, quality is best measured by probability of success given a certain amount of time (think winning a timed chess or go game). Sometimes instead of a binary option, we want to minimize error in a given time (like computing pi).<p>Pick a measure appropriate to the problem. These measures require thinking of the system as a whole, so an AI is not just a program but a physical device, running a program.<p>The domain for the unrestricted claim of intelligence is &quot;reasonable problems&quot;. Having an AI tell you what the mass of Jupiter or find Earth-like planets is reasonable. Having it move its arms (when it doesn&#x27;t have any) is not.

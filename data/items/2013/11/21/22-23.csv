You aren&#x27;t incorrect or just &quot;need to adapt&quot;. We are all not built the same and as an introvert I do fit the &quot;only critics&quot; mold but damn do open plans suck for me.<p>I&#x27;m in a large shared office of 4 desks. I have a single coworker that sits right next to me though him or I moving to the vacant lot doesn&#x27;t really cross our minds. I am however consistently distracted as he&#x27;s particularly fidgety, talks to himself (I do when I&#x27;m alone), and either chews really loudly or I&#x27;ve just grown to hate it. I have had no problems with him as a person but the effects of the constant disruption bring about a certain disdain towards others that distract him or myself. I can&#x27;t divorce myself from it and my ears can&#x27;t take a full day of headphones even if I severely enjoy the music I listen to.<p>I see open plans as facilitators in nothing but pain all around and where I am currently. We&#x27;ve always been in a open office cube farm of some nature but something about the move to a new place specifically designed to be this way was a bigger kick in the balls than I had anticipated. I can&#x27;t think of any place that would prize distractions as a badge of honor either, at least not where developers are concerned. Yet that&#x27;s exactly what we have now and that I&#x27;ve allowed some shitty process to make me this much of a shitty person is the real problem. Its like I can&#x27;t ever correct it either so I just need to move on or it&#x27;s going to continue to push me into atrophy.<p>Basically your last paragraph is key. Notice this early. If you can change policy for your sake, good. If you can&#x27;t, run away. You don&#x27;t deserve the inevitable downturn it&#x27;ll have on your livelihood.",1385074799

6778151,comment,6777517,6778025,14,0,mpdehaan2,,,"Hi mackwic,<p>Disclaimer: original ansible author here and I run engineering for AnsibleWorks.  First off, ansible itself (which this post is about) is text based.  I assume you&#x27;re talking about AWX, which is coming out shortly in 1.4 form, which is our commercial server -- UI and REST API.  (Ansible core is decentralized and doesn&#x27;t even need a server installation).<p>AWX is designed around team workflow and wants to be the central hub around your automation tasks.  i.e. how do you control who can access what, who&#x27;s doing what, and make things push button in the hands of people who might not be the ones writing the content.  You can delegate the ability of lab staff to manage inventory, but not allow them to deploy software, or let them only deploy specific projects, etc.  Same for Dev vs QA vs Ops teams, etc.<p>I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something <i>everybody</i> needs, but it&#x27;s available for those that find it useful, and definitely recommend everybody try it out.  In the last release, we added some nice source control integration features so you can still develop in your editor and retain the ability to have the web console and central logging.  In the upcoming release, we do some neat things with graphically syncing cloud inventory and provide some bonus console information that is useful if you are working with teams who want to know what&#x27;s been going on where, and it improves the ability to quickly drill down and see what parts of your infrastructure might need attention.<p>One of the other features is it&#x27;s ability to hold onto credentials, so you can share source control, machine access, and other credentials with your team without them needing to actually <i>know</i> those credentials.<p>If you remove someone from LDAP, they can cease to have access.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s super important that we don&#x27;t hold ansible core back, so what&#x27;s going into the product is largely around team workflow, and things that automate workflows in Ansible, just like how Ansible automates your system.  It&#x27;s intended to be able to hand Ansible to other people -- and work better in your overall team context, even people who don&#x27;t want to be writing playbooks.  If you&#x27;re a 1 or 2 man shop, you might not need it, but try it out anyway and let us know what you think!<p>Also, here&#x27;s a blog post about the 1.4 Ansible release, which explains the changelog at a bit higher level:<p><a href=\"http://blog.ansibleworks.com/2013/11/21/ansible-1-4-released/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.ansibleworks.com/2013/11/21/ansible-1-4-released...</a>",1385074764

You wait off to the side, and when it&#x27;s your turn for whatever, someone comes and fetches you to their desk in the open-office plan with some space between desks. Instead of shouting your personal issues across a counter, you could discuss it in a normal tone, and if it was private, you could be quieter or more subtle about the topic. Aggressive incidents dropped off a cliff - and there was much less of an &#x27;us-versus-the-gummint&#x27; mentality seeded by the demarcation line of a [fortified] counter.<p>So in this particular use-case, an open-office layout was clearly superior for employees, bosses, productivity, and clients.",1385074544

Pins, skewers, discovered check, forks, double attacks, etc. These are usually in a time frame of around 2-3 moves. This is often described in chess terms as &#x27;concrete&#x27; threats.<p>Strategy concerns more of theoretical ideas, long term possibilities. 10+ moves ahead. This involves pawn structure, where your king is positioned, how your pieces are developed, which side of the board left or right you might launch an attack, end game considerations, etc. How you intend to defend or win the game. This type of play is usually called positional. Whereby the placement of your pieces gives you an overall advantage. In GM level play this is very subtle and 15+ moves ahead. Positional vs. tactical.<p>As an analogy tactics are like cobra strikes and positional play is like a boa constrictor where tiny shifts strangle the opponent in the end. Both are lethal.",1385074346

Ideas are everywhere, ideas are endless. Some of the greatest &quot;ideas&quot; make no profit because there&#x27;s no market for them, consumers don&#x27;t care for it&#x27;s implementation, or the team doesn&#x27;t work well together. So many things have to go just right for an &quot;idea&quot; to become a business. Sometimes you have a great idea, great implimentation, great team, and it all still fails. Investors want you to have already gone and proven you&#x27;re not a gamble by at least building a minimum viable product, have some sort of team already assembled and working, and have started making some kind of revenue or growth in users. If you have nothing then you&#x27;re the type of investment that&#x27;s really a gamble.<p>Winamp has a return on investment (a slow one but still a return), your ideas on the other hand are a gamble. I don&#x27;t mean to discourage you I just want to save you some time. Also asking random people to invest in your ideas is also illegal. You have to have a pre-existing relationship with someone /or/ join a community like AngleList to solicit investment. Angel investors also must have an income over a certain amount of money. Some of these laws may change in the near future with crowd funding becoming so popular but in the mean time be careful.",1385074089

The main things you should do are:<p>1] Develop a good thought process and general approach to the game. NM Dan Heisman has an excellent series of articles (&#x27;The Thinking Cap&#x27;, &#x27;Novice Nook&#x27; and others). Find his stuff and study it well.<p>2] Tactics, tactics, tactics! chesstempo.com is my favourite place for tactics problems. Make an account there and play regularly; you&#x27;ll see a huge and rapid improvement in your game. There are many great books that cover this ground as well.<p>3] Play regularly at reasonably slow time controls (necessary to utilize and internalize the proper thought process), mainly against players who are slightly better than you are. FICS or ICC are great places to play online (humans, unlike chess engines, will not allow you to take back your mistakes, which tends to focus the mind!).<p>4] Analyze your games. Ideally you&#x27;ll have a stronger human to help you with this, otherwise get a strong chess engine. Identify your major tactical blunders and remember the patterns so you can avoid making the same mistakes in future.<p>5] Go through annotated games of the strongest grandmasters. There are lots of collections available. Good ones for starters are Morphy, Marshall, Spielmann, Alekhine, Tal and Kasparov (highly tactical players).<p>6] You can also find GM games where one player resigned. Take the winning side and finish the game against a chess engine on its highest strength. See if you can convert the win.<p>7] Now you can read a bit more about strategy, openings, etc. Try to play openings that lead to open, tactical positions (forget about whatever the latest fashions amongst grandmasters are). Excellent choices are the various gambits, and ancient openings like the Spanish, Italian, etc.<p>Good luck and have fun!",1385073454

The U.S. can&#x27;t compete with asian countries for low-cost manufacturing, but still dominates when it comes to software, design, etc. There is a reason phones designed and built in China run software written in California.<p>Thus, the U.S. wants to enforce rules that treat design as a protectable asset. The reasoning is this: if Apple spends a bunch of money coming up with a really effective design, Samsung shouldn&#x27;t just be able to get the benefit of that work for free. It&#x27;s the mirror of the physical property rules which ensure that if Samsung invests a bunch of money in some new manufacturing facility, Apple can&#x27;t just get the benefit of that work for free.<p>I think such suits will become more common as developed economies keep transitioning away from manufacturing.

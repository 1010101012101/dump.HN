8782191,comment,8781768,8781768,0,0,dripton,,,"I had two different employers go bust in 2002.<p>First one was a startup acquired by a big corporation in 2000, but they gave up on us a couple years later.  How much the larger economic climate affected that, versus the indisputable fact that we were spending a lot more than we were making, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Got another job before the severance ran out.  Second one was a small startup, which ran out of cash and failed to make payroll a few months later.  The owners wanted to keep going on a shoestring and offered me equity to stay, but I didn&#x27;t want to take that gamble.  Again, I can&#x27;t say how much of that was due to the economy (harder to find investors in 2002 than in 2000), versus the fact that the company was spending money and not making any.<p>Got another job right away.  This one was a profitable government contractor, I stayed there for years.<p>My first piece of advice is to always have current, marketable skills.  You don&#x27;t have to chase every trend, but you should know more than one thing, just in case that one thing becomes the next buggy whip.<p>My second piece of advice is not to put all your eggs into one basket.  Salary is more reliable than equity.  Savings will get you through rough times.",1419227829

A lot better than malloc and pointer arithmetic.<p>I get that the original ntpd is almost 20 years old, and opentpd is about a decade old, and back then writing every in C was forgivable, because the alternates were not as far ahead in every metric possible as they are today.

Then they repeated this process over and over such that the company&#x27;s public filings showed a steady increase in revenue quarter after quarter, such an increase that they attracted considerable investor attention, resulting in a stock price that rose steadily on the back of these circular accounting tricks.

8782167,comment,8781768,8781768,0,0,snoonan,,,"I entered the job market at 19 years old in 1998.<p>I did what&#x27;s now called DevOps, automating server and code deployment, monitoring, etc. I could do no wrong. Got promoted, ran a team before I could buy a drink. Got treated like a rockstar with every role I chose to take. People needed to scale and I knew how to do it without hiring a room full of network admins. Serious stock options.  My compensation felt like it was following Moore&#x27;s Law.<p>The startup I worked at failed. My friends, colleagues, former managers, almost entire network all got kicked to the curb around the same time. Recruiters dropped off the face of the earth. There was no one out there to reach out to.<p>I collected unemployment for a few months.<p>I ended up taking a basic IT admin job for a drug trial company at about 60% my salary.  A friend of mine landed at a small business Windows IT consulting shop with a bonus structure I could kill, so I interviewed there. I ended up as a local field engineer driving around to different small business clients fixing windows desktops and printers, but with an extra hours bonus structure that had me back up to my previous salary in a couple of years.<p>In short, I went from a Unix/Linux rockstar to Windows network guy.  Now I own my own language learning business and I&#x27;m back doing part time DevOps consulting (what&#x27;s old is new again). I bill out at $225/hr because people want to scale again. It&#x27;s nuts because just a few short years ago there wasn&#x27;t a company on this earth that would touch me for $30/hr.<p>How does it relate to now? I just spent the past two weeks consulting at a couple of startups, including directly for a startup accelerator and wow, yeah. It&#x27;s the same vibe.<p>I got back on my feet. Most of my friends did too. I had to fix Windows XP desktops for pipe supply companies and law firms for a while. I had to launch my own non-sexy business to really get out of it. Now my tech skill set and interest happened to be popular again, so I&#x27;m taking advantage of that and doing some consulting. I don&#x27;t expect the tech stuff to last, so I prefer to look at my own small language business as my long-term gig. I don&#x27;t trust this.<p>My advice... Industries go through ups and downs, so you will experience it at some point. I survived by becoming OK with helping businesses outside of the bubble. I built my own more or less non-tech business on the side that grew to where I can live off of that if I need to. I advise maintaining a good network across several industries.  If the tech startups bubble pops, you can write code for industrial robot control panels or billing systems. Network in industries outside your comfort zone. My sister-in-law wrote systems on contract for a hotel.  A friend of mine works on enterprise tax software for Mexican companies. If the bubble pops, have a diverse network to reach out to.  The front door&#x27;s going to be jammed with resumes from people like you, all at once.",1419227040

As was the common case across Canada, groups of indigenous people who were in earlier contact with European traders and colonists and who were better able to utilize iron tools and other European technology diligently set about exterminating any hereditary enemies in the vicinity. Read any early ethnographic account from Champlain on and you will find detailed reports of this.<p>The tale of indigenous extermination is not at all simple, and while European diseases certainly played a role, many other factors were also very important. One result of this was that some groups were wiped out almost immediately when Europeans entered the area, while others persisted and even thrived for some centuries after contact.<p>The most devastating effect of disease was likely in the West Coast groups, who left a large number of abandoned villages a few decades after first contact, where contact was very late (in the late 1700&#x27;s) and colonization played a relatively small role in their destruction (the Interior groups were probably more strongly affected by colonization rather than disease, having had more contact with Eastern groups over the preceding centuries and therefore likely some immunity to disease.)",1419226750

They said my interview process was unusual, because every internal interviewer passed on me, while every interviewer from a dot-com gave me a strong recommend.  I was interviewed by them many, many times and finally accepted.<p>It was very different.  At the dot-com&#x27;s that I was at, web servers and application servers were Red Hat Linux, and only the databases were Sun boxes, with E4500 being a high end box.  At a post-IPO dot-com there might be one E6500 and maybe a few Sun E4500&#x27;s, and lots of Red Hat machines.  At the investment bank they were all Solaris on the Unix side, and had dozens of E6500&#x27;s in my city, and hundreds of E4500&#x27;s.  The investment bank had admins in the OpenBoot PROM all the time, whereas I had barely been in it.

No matter how trivial the change.  Three different divisions might have to sign off on the change.

8782141,comment,8781522,8781522,0,0,Animats,,,"A big problem with Rust right now is that the documentation is awful.  This has two implications.  The less important one is that the language is harder to learn. The more important one is that there&#x27;s no architectural document that prevents Rust from becoming a collection of features in search of an architecture.  If you have to clearly explain in writing how something works, and the explanation is overly complex, that&#x27;s an indication that simplifying the design may be necessary.<p>The basic concept of ownership in Rust is simple.  Everything has either a single owner, or a reference counted cell as owner.  Things which cross thread boundaries have a locked reference counted cell as owner.  Temporary references to single-owner objects are allowed, but must have a shorter lifetime than the primary ownership, and this must be demonstrated by simple static analysis.  That&#x27;s straightforward.<p>Making those restrictions usable seems to require many features and much churn within the language.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell how this will come out.

February 2000 and February 2002 were like night and day.  BSCS&#x27;s become much more important as opposed to just experience.  You will see more &quot;BSCS required&quot; in ads.  Networking - people who stayed in touch with former coworkers etc. came out ahead.<p>My career started in 1996.  I had very little college, but knew Unix decently enough to be a sysadmin.  I started at a small ISP, followed by a dot-com startup, followed by another dot-com startup which I was at in 2000.<p>I thought technology stock price/earnings ratios were at historic highs in early 2000 and was expecting a correction. I expected the crash, although it was bigger and longer than I expected.  I thought getting some Fortune 500 experience on my resume would be a good idea.  By the end of the year I was employed at a consulting company that placed me as a Unix sysadmin at a Fortune 100 financial company.  Actually within a few months the company laid off internal staff and told the consulting company (which was pretty integrated into the staff) that they wanted some consultants cut, which I (barely) survived.<p>One mantra of our large consulting company is we never had to worry about the next assignment and money, but that was not true.  During good times, they made the lion&#x27;s share of the consulting fees, during bad times they fired anyone who could not be placed almost immediately.  So the security they promised did not exist.  I had time clocked in at a good placement though so I was safe.<p>I also had my own startup side project which I killed when the stock market crashed.  It was kind of like a Geocities for video games.  It had begun to get traction. It was very dependent on disk space, and I had been thinking of spending tens of thousands of dollars of my own money, not just on some servers but on disk arrays.  Happily I never bought them.  I went with the times - more focused on traction and &quot;eyeballs&quot; than revenue (although I made some revenue from beyond.com which sold software online, it was a public company whose shares went from over $600 to less than $1 and then bankruptcy).<p>Nowadays my efforts are more focused on bootstrapping and getting revenue early.  It&#x27;s worth it for an angel or VC to goad you on to spending money and chasing traction.  They have dozens of bets and only need a few to pay off, you on the other hand might waste years of your life.  I spent little money (colo&#x27;d at my old ISP), and a year of time, and learned programming etc. better so it wasn&#x27;t bad.<p>I visited the Bay Area in late 2000 and had a job offer also, luckily for me I did not pack up and move there.<p>In terms of insulation: \n* A BSCS helps\n* Having lots of money saved helps\n* Money saved does not mean 95% invested in Rackspace stock, since stocks can go down as well as up\n* Keeping in contact with former coworkers helps\n* Having some clean, well architected, &quot;Code Complete&quot; proper code on Github helps\n* Having a side income from your own personal web sites, apps etc. helps<p>Another thing - right now the Bay Area is hot and other US cities are not as much.  But from what I heard from friends, things were bad in the Bay Area in 2000-2001, whereas in LA, New York, Chicago, Boston, DC etc., they were not hit as hard by the tech crash.<p>Also, some people I knew were buying tech stocks on the margin in 2000 or even options (10% margin).  They lost a lot.  Also, unemployed people can eat through their savings very quickly.  But there is no better insulation than having a lot of money saved up.",1419225267

I was rather impressed by that ethereal scene of the graveyard of planes in the sky (in <i>Porco Rosso</i>), and now I know the source. I think the same scene occurs in <i>The Wind Rises</i>; no doubt Miyazaki wants to make full use of the immense poetry of the image. Thanks for sharing that bit of trivia.",1419224713

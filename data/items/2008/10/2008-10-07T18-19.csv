325927,comment,325775,325920,0,0,walterk,,,"Asking yourself ""how would a physicist solve this?"" is a good example of priming.  I can't remember if I read about it in Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, but there was an experiment where a couple groups were given a task, with one group told to imagine that they were professors.  That group performed significantly better than the other.<p>But you'll notice that it takes something more specific than ""work smarter"" to change up the way you approach a problem.",1223405563
325926,comment,325676,325899,0,0,akeefer,,,"Generally true, though one component's ""public API"" is another (higher-level) component's ""implementation details.""  I.e. just because a class has public methods, it might really just be an implementation helper for some other class, and not truly a public API, and unit testing it could cause more future maintenance pain than it's worth.  So deciding what the public API really is isn't always easy.<p>My personal rule of thumb is very similar, though: ""Test at the highest level of abstraction possible.""  If you've got some pretty complicated code that could combinatorially explode if you test higher up the stack, then unit test that code.  Otherwise I've stopped testing every method and every class and focused on higher-level components and assemblages of classes wherever possible, since I've found those tests to be the most stable, cause the least maintenance pain, catch the most bugs up-front, and do the best job of catching regressions.<p>The errors I'm most likely to make are generally ones of assembly (i.e. putting the parts together wrong) rather than small-scale bugs like forgetting a null-check or flipping a > sign (i.e. the parts themselves don't work as designed), so I think it makes sense to optimize for catching those sorts of bugs, which generally will also catch most, but not all, of the small-scale bugs anyway.",1223405476

325923,story,,,29,38,SirName,"Ask YC: What do I do with an unproductive co-founder, 12+ months in?",,"""I release you, Ebenezer""<p>Things have gotten rough for our little company over the last few months.<p>We pushed to meet a market deadline, and stressed out both myself and my cofounder; What's more painful is that we strained our budgets- Putting him on Full time development for a few months, and taking out loans to finance the other development we needed.<p>Unfortuantely, since June or so, he hasn't been holding up his side of the company. He's written less than 100 lines of code in 4 months.<p>Although we've been friends for nearly 10 years, I had to call him last night, and tell him I wanted to buy him out.<p>The way I see it, there are really only two options-<p>* I buy him out, and try to develop on my own, possibly taking on a new co-founder..<p>* I abandon the project, pay off the loans, and lick my wounds, sacrificing the company, and my own financial health for the friendship.<p>It's stressful for both of us, but I'm trying as hard as I can to continue on, not let out beta users know there is a problem, and to preserve what I can.. I'm running out of options.<p>Forcing him to let me buy out his shares, using my departure as a unspoken threat, seems the only option I have, but It's a blunt cudgel, and it would leave me in a weakened position, with 95% of a finished project.<p>Is there any advice on what I should do? I've tried everything I could to motivate him to keep up his side--
I tried paying for his time, both on a monthly basis or hourly, but that doesn't help.. 
I tried engaging him with the users and the project, to try re-engage him with the excitement..
I don't know what to do.<p>We're past the 12 month vesting period we set up, so it seems that the best I can do is force him to sell out to me, but I'd appreciate any other options.",1223405223

It's an approximate model at best.<p>The poster child for this is the idea of ""academic"" work as being less valuable (in dollars, anyway) than work done in a business environment. It's more than just cultural — colleges don't suffer under market stress in quite the same way. Part of that effect is an appreciable tuition, walled garden style.<p>So then you have to question what an academic ""floating"" environment can provide. If half the reason you're there is because you're already motivated to succeed <i>without</i> being there, what do you gain? Does Ivy League provide that in greater amounts?

If one increases the money supply ceteris paribus then one may expect prices to rise and the value of a currency to fall. However, if foreign investors' expectations of the future performance of the US economy improve, then there will be more demand for the dollar and its value will rise on international currency exchanges. This reduces the price of foreign goods and combats inflation.<p>In practice, it is possible to engineer a short-term economic boom by increasing the money supply, so the supply and demand of dollars work against each other and it is impossible to say where its value will go. In the long term, the purchasing power of the dollar has dropped constantly since it went off the gold standard. However, nominal income and wealth has increased faster than the dollar's decline, so our living standards have increased.<p>I'm not an expert, so it's possible I am missing some big factor.

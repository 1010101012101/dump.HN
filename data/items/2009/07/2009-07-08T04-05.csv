Two things I think are causing it...<p>1) I think though something major happened with the move to intel chips and a <i></i>nix backend to OSX.  Dropping PowerPC and the old Mac OS is something Microsoft couldn't do and now Windows is stuck.<p>2) Also major market changes that push it that direction.<p>- iPhone/Touch device and market<p>- Dynamic languages like python + ruby and rails/django web frameworks associated with them<p>- XBOX 360 caused people who were windows PC gamers to go console, making the main reason to buy a PC in the past (games) largely moot.<p>- New multi-platform game engines like Unity3D and now that Mac is Intel you can develop for both easily. (unity3d is what initially made me make the switch)<p>- The cloud computing paradigm (yes it is buzz but real) is pretty much not windows based, it pushes cheap <i></i>nix OSes and a <i></i>nix based OS as your base is much better.<p>- Distributed source control such as git that weren't and aren't very Windows friendly<p>- Finally good systems, right click, and killer machines (one dude I know has a 30 inch Mac screen and a 32GB 8 processor Pro, it is a monster).  These things look like giant iPods now rather than colored beads.<p>- OpenGL is resurging with Khronos support (ES for mobile and all associated libraries)<p>Every developer that I know that has gone that direction has not come back, typically these are talented developers as well and long time windows people (myself included, C++ MFC, MCSD C++, MCSD.NET, .net developer for 8 years, did one of the first public .net sites with Microsoft for a large CPG packaging goods company, game developer on windows)<p>There are more reasons but I see the change, do you?
The fact that you can run lots of great tools even Windows within parallels or bootcamp also added to the move.<p>Once you go Mac you never go...<p>Windows will still be needed for development for some time, but all new, fun and multi-platform development it is not required anymore.

Tet destroyed the VC and the NVA wasn't ready.<p>> The U.S. soldiers were demoralized and did not want to fight in Vietnam because they saw no point in doing so.<p>That didn't happen/start because of conditions ""on the ground"".  That happened in the US.  You remember the US - it's where the troops came from.<p>> Sure, the U.S. military could have consolidated the Tet gains, but at what political cost?<p>You're assuming that the politics flowed from Vietnam back to the US.  It didn't.  Tet was judged a loss in the US while it was happening.  Cronkite called it a loss.<p>Now, if you want to argue that the US would have won except for US politics and that would have been better, fine, but that's a very different argument.<p>> Last but not least, there's no comparison between WW2 and Vietnam.<p>Sure there is.  Neither one was any of our biz.<p>> In Vietnam there was no occupation by an external country.<p>Where do you think that the NVA came from?<p>It was an invasion just like the North taking back the South during the US Civil War.",1247028066

When it was first going, his girlfriend came over to his company and helped make it work for less than she was being paid before. A great girl.<p>A couple years in, they were having a fight outside of the office. They go into the office and he asks her for some documents or some such, and she kind of blows him off. And there's other staff in the office.<p>He says, ""Let's speak outside.""<p>They walk outside, and he says, ""If you ever pull this kind of shit and bring our personal life into work again, you're fired on the spot. We can fight after work. Now we're going inside and doing our jobs.""<p>After that - no problems, the company runs like a well-oiled machine, even when they're having personal problems. This is very important - it's dangerous enough to mix work and romance, you need to do everything you can to keep them separated and not have her use work as romantic leverage.",1247025999

You're just retreating into vagueness instead of arguing pertinent points.  You're also projecting opinions on me that I haven't stated, apparently because you're more comfortable with parrotable dogma than relating your own opinions. Suddenly, instead of arguing for my own specific statements, you expect me to argue against extremely general statements about technology and phrophetic claims of inevitibility.  You'd might as well say ""God wills it"" for all the passivity and coarseness of thought you've expressed here.<p>You're making the worst sort of argument that a person can make about transhumanism when you pretend that everything with turn out perfectly in some distant future regardless of the actions taken by people in the meantime. That is faith, not reason, and I'll have no part of it.<p>Reality is not an implementation detail.  We're done here.",1247025892

There are no friendly fire restrictions, but people generally agree that shooting your teammate is a bad thing, so it's not generally done.
However there are some corporations that have a different culture, and your ship is destroyed by your commander to set an example to keep the fleet in line.<p>This is one of the main reasons I find Eve interesting; The single shard sandbox style brings out a much more interesting social dynamic.

Mine might be a bit more unorthodox.<p>Here's my experience - driven men don't become less driven. You need a woman who is filled with excitement and joy at the thrill of being with a driven man. You'll never have peace with a girl who doesn't like you being too busy, and you'll come to resent her if you give up your goals. Also, this might not be politically correct to say, but I've seen a tremendous many woman get a guy to scale down for her, only to have her interest wane and she leaves. Guys get furious about that later.<p>For me, the key is having women in my life who understand and appreciate what I do. The best way, I found, is to find a girl who has the kind of father you aspire to be like. I tend to date the daughters of self-made men who were incredibly driven. The daughter of that kind of man has kind of an intuitive understanding of when to tell you to take a break, when to leave you alone, and so on. She also understands what she's getting with you.<p>Never suppress your dreams and ambitions for a woman - if you do, you'll resent her and that's not a healthy foundation for your relationship. If you're driven, you'll need the kind of woman who thrives with a driven man.",1247025670

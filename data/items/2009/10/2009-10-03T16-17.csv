858919,comment,858896,858896,0,0,sunir,,,"I'm interested in the contrast between Flickr and the portfolio sites. I believe (I may be mistaken) Flickr restrained itself in order to allow the photos to be the dominant visual element.<p>I understand why the portfolio sites are overly designed. It's a quick way to scream, ""Hey, we're for designers!"" It's more for designers learning from other designers than as a showcase to non-designers.<p>Flickr is more about the mass market consuming beautiful photos, so that is different. It's interesting that Virb (<a href=""http://www.virb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virb.com</a>) aims kind of in the middle, and its design is kind of in the middle.",1254589129

858914,comment,858679,858799,0,0,ellyagg,,,"He was talking about factors under your control. So I guess you have to decide whether you think you can get significantly smarter, which I don't. You can learn more, but that takes time and should be considered part of working, of course. Even if you can get smarter, that would also presumably take work and the more of it you did the smarter you'd get. What we know for sure is that you can't just wake up today and say, hey, I'm going to make decisions that are twice as good as yesterday.<p>And if working smarter means things like automating tasks, that also doesn't quite make sense. Of course you should automate tasks. Working harder doesn't mean being stupid. It means you should spend more of your brain time working toward your goals. If you free up time by automating some stuff, that gives you more time to be working on (including automating) something else.",1254588856

I guess what I should really try is to use a very big monitor, so that I can have for instance the xterms in one side, IRC in another place of the screen, and so on, all visible, with a goal: instead of a notification I can see what is happening in the other windows, and chances are I don't need to take any action at all.<p>Btw using an external monitor I lost the ""portability"" benefits of the macbook, and I'm used to work on the balcony when it's sunny :)<p>This poses another problem btw, the contrast is too low with the macbook display.",1254588519

Since most everything went into storage, my development machine was a Toshiba Portege  3440 with a 12"" 1920x1200 WUXGA screen. (Great machine, BTW)<p>I worked this way for about 2 or 3 months, and loved it.  I got accustomed to switching desktops and console sessions and toggling about.<p>Now I use a Dell Lattitude with a 15"" 1920x1200 screen, and a 24"" 1920x1200 monitor attached.  And I have my Windows and Mac boxen sharing a keyboard (Endurapro 104 ""clacky"" keyboard with built-in clit mouse) and 24"" 1920x1200 monitor as well.<p>The second monitor has its advantages (I can keep a nice busy set of IRC channels always in view) but I still tend to work via desktop toggling.

Some of the reasons for me:<p>* With VPS systems you generally have to run one of their kernels, or at least Linux. Very few BSD VPS sites and none allow me to run OpenBSD, which is what I would like.<p>* The low cost Atom systems give you <i>much</i> more ram and hard disk than the VPS sites for comparable cost. In the $30  range a VPS will give about 512M of ram and 10-20G of hard disk space. Most of the Atom/low cost dedicated hosts are roughly the same cost and give 2-3G of ram and 60-100G of drive space.

It is entirely about product recognition and generating brand equity, which in turn provides real value to the business. Apple are masters of this. These documents are sample proof of this at work. 
It is all part of the Brand Experience.<p>Apple are about as brand-centric as it gets. They are a case study on how to manage a brand properly.<p>Perhaps next time you should familiarize yourself with the concept of branding and all it entails before you direct an unnecessary and ill advised rant (your words) at me or anyone else.

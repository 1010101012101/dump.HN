959026,comment,959001,959001,0,0,Kliment,,,"What doesn't make sense to me here:
1. Why has nobody done this before? It seems trivial technically. The only good reason I can think of is that the Twitter crowd and the PowerPoint crowd and the Visual Studio crowd do not intersect enough for it to happen.
2. Why is SAP doing it? That's a pretty certain way to ensure the general public will not use it.",1259060335

I don't know what percentage of iPhone users actually jailbreak their phones, but looking at the iPhone users I know, I can only think of one person that jailbreaks. It might not be worth the effort of actually making a different version just for people who jailbreak. If app developers really did embrace this, that might drive more people to jailbreak, but I highly doubt your average Joe going through the process of jailbreaking, even if it isn't particularly hard.<p>On top of that, there might be fears of piracy. I don't know how valid it would be, but targeting users who jailbreak is also targeting the only people that pirate since you have to have a jailbroken phone to pirate.",1259060132

959013,comment,958396,958645,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The LHC is a complicated one-off piece of machinery. If you build something this complicated and this powerful then it is prudent to ramp up the power bit by bit and check it out after the runs to see if there are unexpected issues before going full power. At successively higher power levels you can expect small but hopefully not fatal problems to come up.<p>By your reasoning they should have just flipped the switch to 'full on' at the first run, and that would have probably caused a lot more damage than it did at the time.<p>Think of it as a brand new engine design, before putting your pedal to the metal you'd run it at low revs for a while and check out the vibration modes, the wear patterns and so on before taking it all the way to the redline.<p>Failing to do so will most likely result in catastrophic failure. Don't forget that there is only one LHC and if you mess it up too much you may not get another one for several decades, if ever.<p>They're prudent, they did this before (in the smaller ring and in a bunch of other accelerators all over the globe) and I hope they will maintain that attitude all the way to the finish line.",1259059801

Arresting people is supposedly reserved for serious offenses, 'refusing to tweet' isn't one of them.<p>What's next ? You have to put a message on your facebook page or you'll be arrested for not cooperating ? Myspace ? The google wave ?",1259059083

959000,comment,958720,958760,0,0,Kliment,,,"These deals tend to fall apart over time though, as the content quality differential fades. If you are the only channel (or network) offering a certain content (or device) then you win by keeping it as a bundle. But both content and mobile client devices change fairly rapidly. If others start producing content that is equally good or even slightly worse, but much easier to access (due to indexing, being free, being linked to), you lose from your bundling, and you start losing content as well. If other devices are equally good or better, you want to break bundling as much as possible so that your competitors get a smaller share of bundle revenues.",1259058261

But in the 'P' vs 'p' case, minimum size could be larger - fixing the calling code is fine, but is there a change that can be made to stop this bug appearing in other calling code? Eg, simplify the interface so that one of the 'p's is protected, so that the wrong Percent can't be set by accident.",1259057363

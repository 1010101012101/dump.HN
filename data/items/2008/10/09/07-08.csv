Why do I need to subscribe to all these blogs when the best content for me ends up on the front page of HN?<p>That said, I'm wondering if there is any other content out there that like-minded folks would suggest I turn my attention to.<p>No techcrunch or any of that crap.

If I was hiring, I'd be interested in top-notch people who are passionate but also just really damn smart, rather than having, say, specific platform or language knowledge. This is what Google did, and it's worked out pretty well for them.<p>I interviewed for an APM position at Google yesterday and the guy gave me a pretty tough technical question. It was actually harder than any of the dev questions I got from them. After working through it, he said ""You'd be surprised how many people don't even give me the brute force solution."" So yeah, these questions have their merits.",1223537516

They are having success with that while the bigger houses just are not selling or are selling at a loss.  There have been a lot of ""small"" exits (small as in tens of millions instead of hundreds of millions).  I believe it is better to have an exit, regain all of the money you spent + take away a couple of extra million then going for broke.",1223537495

But, once I switched to a good chair, I've never had any keyboard related pains (while I'd experienced tons of problems before that, and experimented with split keyboard layouts to no avail...one thing that did help, was switching to a tiled window manager and almost completely killing the mouse from my workflow).  I guess everybody is different, but I'm perfectly content with a good quality traditional keyboard (though a shorter reach to escape is a nice feature).",1223536392

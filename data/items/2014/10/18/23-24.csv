Many browsers can already play back MJPEG streams (common with IP cameras), so I do not see the point of this other than as an &quot;it can be done&quot; exercise.<p>Also worth noting that animated SVG (vector format) is usually bigger than the equivalent SWF file - despite all the hate Flash gets (after the Adobe acquisition was when it seemed to get worse), I think it&#x27;s a great compact vector animation format. You can also put MJPEG inside a SWF, so they&#x27;re on equal footing with respect to that.",1413676670

It makes a lot of sense the way you explain it, and I quickly got the idea that you can make some powerful expressions this way.<p>The smooth creation of lists is I think one of the most important language features higher level languages have over lower level languages like C.<p>Just this thing:<p><pre><code>    c::a$&quot;\n&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s all I needed to be convinced that modern languages should have similar view constructs. In ruby it&#x27;d be:<p><pre><code>  c = a.map.with_index{|a,i| a == &quot;\n&quot; ? i : nil }.reject{|i| i.nil? }\n</code></pre>\nQuite a mouthful, mainly because Ruby lacks a neat way to do &#x27;$&#x27;.

8476786,comment,8472157,8475060,0,0,quadrangle,,,"Your questions are great! They totally fit the scope of actual music theory.<p>The first thing to understand is that written music notation is not music. Partially, this is like the way that written English is not spoken English. All the notation we&#x27;ve inherited from Bach specifies certain things and leaves other elements unspecified, in much the same manner as this text really fails to carry the tone and delivery you would hear from me in real life.<p>I can read some English text in different ways and bring out an amazing range of meaning and interpretation in how I express it. Likewise with music. We can speculate about what Bach had in mind, but we can only use various bits of evidence, writing, known practices, etc. to guess about anything not present in the notation.<p>There are tons of parallels between music and speech, and I recommend the book <i>Music, Language, and the Brain</i> by Ani Patel for more in-depth about this.<p>The stuff in the book I mentioned originally (Music and Memory) gets into a lot of the issues too. Our processing of all these interacting parts has to do with the various psychoacoustic factors that make things merge together or heard distinctly in our perception. <i>Auditory stream segregation</i> describes the factors in how we follow a line of music and why we relate one note to another instead of in a different way. And some things are really distinct, so everyone hears them the same way. Many others are ambiguous so you and I can hear the <i>exact same sounds</i> and actually parse the music quite differently in our heads.<p>I actually could sit down with you and make sense of all the subjective experiences given understandings from psychology and explain much of what is going on in each of your examples. It&#x27;s a bit hard to express in text though, easier in person with the ability to gesture and intone and sing while discussing and experiencing the different examples.",1413676568

8476774,comment,8472157,8475646,0,0,scottious,,,"Thank you :)<p>I think a &quot;linter&quot; like that would be kind of like a linter for analyzing poetry or short stories.  It&#x27;s so subjective that the most it could do would be offer very superficial suggestions without really understanding context.  Things like &quot;does it have a rhyming scheme and meter&quot;.  And that&#x27;s not that useful because some poetry doesn&#x27;t rhyme, and some doesn&#x27;t adhere to a meter.<p>Like, is <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> bad writing?  some might say so... but can you deny the popularity of it?  Are the people that enjoyed reading that book wrong for enjoying it?  Trying to apply an objective measure to quality of writing or music is futile, I think.  Same goes for music.  You might write a song that some stuffy old classical music PhD would scoff at but maybe children LOVE it.  How could a linter possibly know that?<p>I say embrace the subjectivity of it.  Write a song, ask people what they think of it.  Accept that you will not write super great songs right away and just keep writing and experimenting.  Use theory as a language to explain what you&#x27;ve done in songs you wrote and songs that you like.<p>Good luck!!",1413676312

8476760,comment,8472157,8475367,0,0,quadrangle,,,"I appreciate your attempt at balance, but I still fundamentally disagree. Math is universal. The arithmetic and other math basics we learn in grade school is both (A) not very culturally-biased and (B) often not taught well.<p>There is <i>so</i> much cultural baggage and assumption in the notation-focused &quot;music theory&quot; that is <i>not</i> present in mathematics. When we talk about numbers of things in math, there&#x27;s no doubt we&#x27;re describing something objective about reality external to culture. There indeed exists two apples or four apples. The concept of &quot;four notes&quot; is rarely objectively valid because almost everything in music is subjective.<p>&quot;Music theory&quot; basics are much more analogous to the elementary-school versions of linguistic grammar. And most elementary teachers&#x27; understanding of grammar is actually full of claims that are wrong, even though there&#x27;s something to the gist of it. When we go to &quot;English&quot; class, we expect to learn about English and don&#x27;t think our lessons apply to all languages. We should similarly not teach one particular language of music and call the lessons &quot;music&quot; without qualification. We should further recognize that grade-school definitions of nouns and verbs do not all hold up under scrutiny.<p>When &quot;music theory&quot; of the sort here is taught <i>well</i>, it is about as valid and useful as grade-school pedantic, prescriptivist, grammar — the sort that treats minority dialects as &quot;bad grammar&quot;. Insisting on music theory being this notation-jargon from classical Europe is like saying that African-American dialects have poor grammar, when actually there are careful and consistent implicit rules in those dialects that sometimes carry useful meaning that standard American English doesn&#x27;t even have a way to achieve.",1413675907

8476756,comment,8475280,8476531,0,0,srean,,,"> I was comparing non-inline function to virtual function<p>Then you are fighting a strawman. The decision to use virtuals or not has to be taken in the context of all the benfits, and inlining is a prominent one among them. Another is vectorization. Inlining a single function sometimes trigger an avalanche of other optimizations, so the cost of using virtuals can be quite high in such scenarios.  It is a n unrepresentative to rule out some of the main motivators for choosing non virtual over virtual.<p>In my experience people who harp on the line that virtual functions are free, are those who do not write number crunching code, where the benefits are most apparent.<p>That said, vtable is really a neat performance optimization that targets runtime polymorphism. The problem lies in the fact that many people believe that runtime polymorphism is the only path to polymorphism. Java programmers certainly believe so, for a reason of course. Many uses of runtime polymorphism can be replaced by compile time polymorphism without any loss in flexibility, and frequent gains in performance. In many parts of code I know for certain that the types wont change, and in such cases runtime polymorphism is un-necessary. Many a game engine, array processing code has been written with zero or very sparse use of that feature.<p>There is this raging debate about whether C++ / D functions should default to virtuals, just like in Java. I certainly am in the camp that believes that they should not because runtime polymorphism is not as uniform a necessity as it is made out to be, as long as the language offers compile time polymorphism. Java is out of luck here, its designers did not include compile time polymorphism features or syntactic sugars (if I am not mistaken) but for C++ and D their defaults make sense.<p>@Jasode Indeed and in fact I had upvoted your comment even before writing my comment above.",1413675833

I confess that I tend to write comments for my future self. I know that when I come back to code I&#x27;ve written, I often don&#x27;t recall instantly what the problem at hand was or how I solved it. Now you&#x27;ve got me thinking that maybe I&#x27;m just in the wrong language. When you&#x27;re at this higher level of abstraction, maybe it&#x27;s easier to see your intent.<p>In terms of debugging your code, obviously the power of a terse language such as K or Q is that, presumably, it&#x27;s easier to find bugs by inspection. How do you debug them?<p>AW: In C I never learned to use the debugger so I used to never make mistakes, but now I make mistakes and I just put in a print statement. K is interpreted, so it&#x27;s a lot easier. If I&#x27;m surprised at the value of some local at some point, I can put in a print, and that&#x27;s really all I do.<p>BC: That works well when you have deterministic inputs. What if the nature of the problem is just less reproducible—for example, if you were in an event-driven system where you had a confluence of events that led to a problem?<p>AW: It has been 20 years now that I&#x27;ve had Wall Street customers—they&#x27;re doing 2 billion transactions a day and they have trillion-row databases—and in those 20 years, there was one time where we couldn&#x27;t reproduce the bug.

The emphasis on improvisation requires players to have comprehensive understanding of the underlying harmonic concepts – you can play jazz completely by ear, but this is not the norm by any means.<p>As a couple of commenters have said, your HTML analogy just doesn&#x27;t seem to fit here, music theory is descriptive, not prescriptive. The best way to learn it is through playing music, a lot, and then using concepts from music theory to go back and gain more insight into why certain things sound the way they do, why certain progressions work well, why an F natural sounds ethereal and sublime on top of a B∆9 chord while an E natural sounds awful, and so on.<p>Again, I believe the optimal way to learn music concepts is to play (not study) music.<p>If jazz doesn&#x27;t interest you, I would ask you what your musical goals are, and what genres do interest you, and just encourage you to play, and then play some more. Ideally, play with musicians who are better than you - you&#x27;ll learn more, faster, just like anything else. It takes thousands of hours to get good at this stuff.",1413673995

I have a reddit account but have not done much on there, and I have a twitter but have barely used that as well so I have no clue what it&#x27;s like to receive lots of communication on those platforms.<p>My experience is with things like email, Facebook, and chatrooms. With email you can block addresses, report it as spam, click a trash button to throw it away, make a new email and don&#x27;t share it publicly. Facebook you can ignore friend requests and report people.<p>Chatrooms (and video game chats) always have an ignore feature, and that is where a lot of the sentiment behind my post came from. It always bugs me when people get into these long conversations with trolls to the point that they are crying and complaining for mods to ban them, when they can simply use the ignore feature. I inform them about this feature and they choose to ignore my advice and continue to complain about it. People complaining about trolls are more annoying than trolls in these cases.<p>Anyways, clearly I am not a social enough person to understand the problems at play here.",1413673335
8476633,comment,8475809,8476292,0,0,geocar,,,"I&#x27;ll give this a shot. I&#x27;ll try to explain what&#x27;s in my mind as I read it as well.<p>First, get out the reference manual: <a href=""http://kparc.com/k.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kparc.com/k.txt</a> and we&#x27;ll do the first couple lines.<p>The sequence that goes f x applies x to f. this f is unary.<p>The sequence that goes x f y applies x and y to f. this f is binary (and just labelled verb).<p>Some things (adverbs) go f a x and apply f in some special way to x.<p>Last hint: You read this code from left to right (like english). Do not scan it.<p>Now let&#x27;s dive in:<p><pre><code>    c::a$&quot;\n&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis says: c is a view of where a is a newline. That is, if &quot;a&quot; contains a file, then c is the offsets of each newline.<p>A view is a concept in k that is unusual in other languages: When &quot;a&quot; gets updated, then &quot;c&quot; will automatically contain the new values. This is similar to how a cell in Excel can refer to other cells and reflect whatever the value of those cells happens to be.<p><pre><code>    b::0,1+c\n</code></pre>\nThis says: b is a view of zero join one plus c. That is, where &quot;c&quot; contains the offsets of each newline, 1+c would contain the beginning of each new line. We joint zero to the beginning because of course, the beginning of the file is also the beginning of a line.<p><pre><code>    d::(#c),|/-&#x27;:b\n</code></pre>\nThis says: d is the view of the (count of c) joined with the max reduce, of each pairs difference of b. That sounds like a lot, but &quot;each pairs difference of b&quot; (where b is the position of all the new lines) is also the length of each line, and the max reduce of that is the longest line. You might say that &quot;d&quot; is the dimensions of the file.<p><pre><code>    i::x,j-b x:b&#x27;j\n</code></pre>\nThis says: i is a view of x (?) joined with j (?) minus b (the offset of the beginning of each line) applied to each x which is defined as the bin of j in b.<p>j hasn&#x27;t been defined yet, but you can see that x is defined later in the definition, and used to the left. This is because K (like APL) executes from right to left just like other programming languages. you write a(b(c(d()))) in C and you&#x27;re executing the rightmost code first (d) then applying that leftwards. We can do this with anything including definitions.<p>The other string thing is that we know that b is the offset of the beginning of each line, and yet we&#x27;re applying something to it. This is because k does not distinguish between function application and array indexing. Think of all the times you write in JavaScript x.map(function(a) {return a[whatever] }) when you&#x27;d really just like to write x[whatever] -- k let&#x27;s you do this. It&#x27;s a very powerful concept.<p>On that subject of binning: b&#x27;j is going to find the index of the value of b that is smaller or equal to j. Since we remember that b is the offset of the beginning of each line, then if j is an offset in the file, then this will tell us which line it is on(!)<p>But we don&#x27;t understand what j is yet; it&#x27;s the next definition:<p><pre><code>    j::*|k\n</code></pre>\nThis says: j is a view of the last (first reverse) of k. We don&#x27;t know what k is yet.<p><pre><code>    f:&quot;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis says: f is defined as an empty string.<p><pre><code>    g::a$f\n</code></pre>\nThis says: g is a view of the offsets of f (an empty string) in a. Initially this will be null, but other code will assign to f later making g a value.<p>Next line.<p><pre><code>    s::i&s|i-w-2\n</code></pre>\nThis is very straightforward; & is and, and | is or. While excel doesn&#x27;t let us use a cell in it&#x27;s own definition, k does: It means the <i>old value of s</i>. So this is literally: the new view of s is i and the old view of s or i minus w (?) minus 2.<p>We don&#x27;t know what w is yet.<p><pre><code>    S:{s::0|x&d-w}\n</code></pre>\nThis is a function (lambda). x is the first argument. If we called S[5] it would be the same as setting s to zero or 5 and d (dimensions) minus w. Double-colon changes meaning here; it no longer means view, but set-global.<p><pre><code>    px:{S s+w*x}\n</code></pre>\nThis requires some knowledge of g/z: <a href=""http://kparc.com/z.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kparc.com/z.txt</a><p>Note that px is defining a callback for when the pageup/pagedown routines are called. x will be 1 if we page down and -1 if we page up. It may now become clear that S is a setter of s that checks it somehow. When we understand what w is (later in the program) it will be absolutely clear, but pageup/pagedown are changing s by negative w when pageup, and positive w when pagedown.<p><pre><code>    wx:{S s+4*x}\n</code></pre>\nConsulting the g/z documentation, we can see this has to do with wheels. Note we modify s again relative to 4 times x; x is -1 when wheelup and 1 when wheeldown. It becomes clear that s is modified by the pageup/pagedown and the mouse wheel.<p><pre><code>    cc:{9&#x27;*k_a}\n</code></pre>\nAgain: in the documentation, 9&#x27; stashes something in the clipboard. cc is a function that takes the first slice of offsets k (we still don&#x27;t understand) in a (the file). The g/z documentation says that cc is the callback for control-C. This is expected as control-C traditionally copies things to the clipboard. Since the slice of offsets k in a are being saved in the clipboard, we may guess at this point that k will contain the current selection.<p>This process is time consuming, but it is to be expected: Learning english took a while at first, and often required consulting various dictionaries. Eventually you got better at it and could read somewhat quickly.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you want to try the next few lines yourself to see if you can get a feel for it, or if you want to try one of the less dense examples:<p>* <a href=""http://www.kparc.com/$/view.k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kparc.com/$/view.k</a>\n* <a href=""http://www.kparc.com/$/edit.k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kparc.com/$/edit.k</a><p>... or if you want me to keep going like this, or if you want to ask a few questions.

After using K for a while, my Python and C both have much much fewer (structs in C more often than python, as C is missing python&#x27;s dict). And the code has gotten much shorter and more efficient. Arguably, more readable as well. And I&#x27;ve essentially dropped C++ for C, because the extra complexity is just not worth it.",1413673250

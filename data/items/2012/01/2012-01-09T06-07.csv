When you measure using this metric Android is anything but instant.<p>Web apps ""check for updates and install"" every time you use them. Users are forced to update and depending on the site within a matter of minutes nearly everybody will be using the new version.<p>Android apps don't go through a review process, but it still takes a few minutes for the servers to get the update. It will take an hour or two for every phone to get notified of the update (it's not pushed) and give the user a notification. It will then be even longer for the user to push the button and receive your beautiful new code. There are a few users with ""automatic updating"" but it's not enabled by default. The majority of your user base will take a while to finish migrating over. I would love if anybody here had real numbers on this, our app only just started reporting version numbers so we haven't been able to collect the data yet.<p>There are exceptions. The Facebook app renders webpages so most updates happen instantly, but when they update one of the native sections there's still a long wait before everyone has it.",1326091910

The ones where youre looking across the subway platform at someone, and you wish you could get their number, but you cant really shout across the tracks?<p>Well, I was in New York City this weekend and I had a sudden inspiration. Theres a (hypothetical) solution to the missed connections problem. And its sitting around in plain sight.<p>Heres how it works. Many of you are probably aware that Facebook has been steadily developing its facial recognition algorithm. Its quite good at this point. It can scan any of your photos and tag you automatically, if youve enabled the feature. That means Facebooks algorithm can recognize your unique face. It stands to reason, therefore, that Facebooks algorithm could scan any photo from any of its 800 million members, and recognize you if youre in it.<p>So, lets take that one logical step further. Imagine you take a photo of someone and upload it to Facebooks servers. Facebook can analyze the photo and tag that persons face.<p>I bet you see where Im going with this.<p>Youre back on the subway platform  you see someone across the way. You raise your phone and snap a quick picture via the Facebook app. The train comes. While youre pulling away, the app has displayed that persons profile. You click friend.<p>And just like that, missed connections are a thing of the past.<p>Interesting, eh? Also, creepy. Obviously, if Facebook enabled this feature it would cause a firestorm of privacy concerns. But Facebook hasnt exactly shown much concern for privacy in the past. And everyone does have a public profile, anyway and subways are public areas. Given that the tech exists right now, I bet well see this within a couple years.<p>The implications are rather large.<p>Dan",1326091763

3441659,comment,3441451,3441498,2,0,Niten,,,"I would assume that the backdoor for Android devices is the Android Market itself.<p>Because Android is open source and each device manufacturer has its own build, it isn't really plausible to have a single backdoor within the core operating system.  However, the closed-source Android Market application is the perfect candidate for such a mechanism; when you install an app via the market, all of the following happens:<p>1. You request the application from the Market and agree to any permissions requested.<p>2. The Market pushes an install instruction to the phone via Google's XMPP-based Android notification service.<p>3. The phone downloads and installs the .apk as instructed.<p>Step 3 requires no interaction from the user  this is how, for instance, you can send an app to your phone from the Market web site.  But it also means that any government with sufficient leverage over Google can coerce them to use this mechanism to install an arbitrary SpyOnStuff.apk at any time.<p>But if this is the case it isn't entirely bad news for Android users, rather it yields two means of protecting yourself which aren't necessarily options on other platforms:<p>1. Use an open source Android build such as CyanogenMod, without the closed-source Market app installed.<p>2. Proxy Google's XMPP notification service and require user confirmation before pushed APKs are installed.  I don't know of any Android mods that currently implement this capability, but it would be nice to see in future versions of Cyanogen or similar.",1326090453

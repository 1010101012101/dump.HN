4222735,comment,4222072,4222699,3,0,BvS,,,"Don't they sell the iPad 2 for 400 US$? This would be at least 150US$ more than the most expensive Nexus 7 and 200US$ more than the standard version or the kindle fire (assuming the next version won't be more expensive). I'm sure Apple could meet the price point or even undercut it (bear in mind that Google ads 25US$ credit for the Play store) but that would mean their margin goes down a lot. I'm not sure Apple is willing to go down that route.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't believe that Apple is going to release a product that is inferior in some main aspects (eg screen resolution) and trying to compete on price.",1341910776

Not the 25 y/o millionaires/billionaires you see passing the homepage here. The Citizen Kane quote was done in the context of someone who spends all his money rather than saves it. That's the clue here; if you live frugal and save all you can of your wage, you'll be a millionaire around 60 without effort. Remember; all you want to do is make a lot of money so you don't want to spend money on fun stuff, kids, family, vacations etc. In the area from the Netherlands I came from (and this goes for other parts on earth too i'm sure) all old farmers are millionaires. They NEVER spent $0.01 they didn't absolutely had to spend.<p>So, again (and this is the reason why most people are not automatic millionaires after a certain age) IF getting a lot of money is ALL you want to do, you will sacrifice things; you will move to a cheap place, you will eat and live cheap. So yes, it's easy, but maybe not what you wanted to hear.<p>I don't want to wait that long so I have the next easiest thing; software services. Works great, no competition. It's much harder than the above, but it's also much quicker.",1341908837

For the past 2 years I've been reading ebooks, and for the past 6 months I've been using an iPad for reading ebooks, and I've found it just too cumbersome in many cases -- you essentially need 2 hands to hold it, the screen size is unnecessarily large for 99% of books I read, and it's almost too large for using on-the-go.<p>(Regardless of whether you read electronic books, the simple fact is that very many people prefer ebooks to physical books, myself included, and have many very reasonable reasons why.  There are also many reasons why it would seem that reading eBooks is one very reasonable use for the iPad.)<p>What about the alternatives?<p>The iPhone screen I find too small for many books (ie. if they have diagrams/pictures/graphs especially).<p>The Kindle (and other eInk eBook readers) I've found to be a pain to navigate to take notes/highlights on and are poor at displaying diagrams/pictures/graphs.<p>So from my experiences, I think a 7-8 inch one could be the sweet spot as long as:<p>1. I can use it with one hand (e.g. it's not too large or heavy).<p>2. Can be used to easily take notes and highlight.<p>3. Performs great (can flip pages quickly).

It kinda tries to force some history into context but it's generally really bad.<p>Second, you have much more transparency in Romania for companies, even if they are privately held. So this quote is rather pointless and shows no homework was done:<p>> Although its privately-held, Talpes told me that it employs 670 people  10% more than in 2011. Publicly-traded competitor, AVG (AVG), has $295 million in revenues and 870 employees  $339,000 in revenues per employee  and a net profit margin of 32%.<p>You can totally look online[1,2,3] for informations on the Bitdefender company and see that, for example, in 2010 it has about 30 million euro in revenue (so that's about 45,000 euro per employee) and a net profit of only 250,000 euro which means a margin of 0.7%. (PS: I would love to learn how they managed to pay so little taxes!)<p>I think an IPO is a good idea, but I would love if Romania would start to be known for something other than antivirus solutions. The other big thing we had was the sale or RAV (Romania Anti Virus) to Microsoft in the early 2000s.<p>BTW, an IPO is a big thing here because generally we don't use the stock market to finance companies. We use banks, which also explains why our companies aren't that innovative.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.firme.info/bitdefender-srl-cui18189442/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firme.info/bitdefender-srl-cui18189442/</a>

How long will BMW last when that happens?""</i><p>Unfortunately, that analogy just doesn't work in the car industry. People will still buy the BMW because it is a BMW.<p>To back it up, I'll give you a two real world examples, both to do with another car Manufacturer - Porsche.<p>When Dr Ferdinand Porsche first created his company, his Porsche 64 was created using many parts from the VW Beetle.<p>From my personal experience, back in 2002, I was helping my brother strip down his 1986 Porsche 944 turbo to be raced in 03.<p>While pulling the car down, I noticed that many of the parts were manufactured by Audi and VW (which admittedly owns Audi). Even while we were stripping the sound proofing material off the body, I found out that the body of the car was manufactured by Audi, which to me was very surprising (given the body was one of the main selling points of the car at the time, even Mazda ripped off the design for the RX7).<p>If I had to give a rough breakdown in parts, I would have said that particular model was a 3-way split when it came to who's parts were in the car.<p>As for Porsche's company performance, they are one of the strongest car brands worldwide and definitely one of the most profitable, in 07 having made 5.8 Billion Euro profit off of 7.3 Billion Euro in revenue.<p>Currently, the only thing that is causing them headaches is their financial acrobatics, not the fact that their cars are made out of other manufacturer's parts.<p>So unfortunately, your analogy just doesn't hold up.",1248943142

HN is too focused on programming, but I am thinking of electronics, photonics, semiconductor, nanotech, biotech people, etc. It takes so long to train experts on these fields, and since many of them were funded via NSF as graduate students, it would be wise to create incentives for them to stay in the U.S. and be productive.<p>Does that mean that a founder visa is necessary?

From what I have read about pg's founder visa, I don't see how that includes your situation.<p>It does seem reasonable that the U.S. should be tripping over themselves to provide a visa to anyone that can create jobs or be an overwhelming contributor to taxes.<p>From the government's view, how would they make such a decision?  In your case, your already here and already have a going concern which seems an easy thing to write regulations for.  What about for those just starting with no employees and no revenue?  What about for those that just show up at the airport and say ""I'm gonna give it my best shot, where's my visa?"".  Is it ok to show up and say, ""Hey Paul Graham gave me and my friend $15k, let me in.""<p>I like the idea, but I don't see how the rules get written and managed.",1248942492

The app favors broadcasters it has never seen live before, so often it's just a couple of users who are ""new"" that minute, and therefore the app favors those users far and above of anybody else because there are only a few that fit that criteria, when it ""hits"".  However, I like that algorithm.  It's just missing the next piece: specifically ignoring the channels the viewer has just seen, which I will work on tomorrow.",1248942060

731846,comment,730907,731523,0,0,jhancock,,,"Your point is well taken.  However, we do have lots of talent already here (many are ones already here on various student and work visas).  YC is limited to a narrow set of  people that can ""afford"" the process.  I do not buy the argument that this implies we need to increase the pool of eligible applicants with a special visa.  Perhaps YC will simply reach its limits.  Thats ok, there is no reason that something has to keep growing in size to continue to be a success; it could just reach a natural equilibrium.<p>Is there any evidence that the U.S. does not already have the talent?  Or is it only that there is not enough talent that can afford to work at such low entry rates?  Please keep in mind that our visa programs that already exist are  to fill positions where there is proven lack of skills.  They do not exist so the investor or business owners can find cheaper labor.",1248941963

The cases that are brought up in this article aren't baseless, as you say, it's just that the <i>real</i> reasons are camouflaged as other more generic reasons.<p>But there have been other cases where the ""reasons"" given have been <i>completely</i> without explanation.<p>I'm a huge Apple fan.

731834,comment,731771,731771,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Super idea, now to get <i>all</i> papers online in a free form.<p>The big name publications reject more than they can publish for several reasons:<p>- lack of space\n  (there are only so many pages each month in their usually dead-tree format publications)<p>- overexposure of a subject \n  (they usually try to keep some variety in what they publish)<p>- some papers are just plain wrong.<p>The article makes the case that two very important papers were rejected (without giving reasons why) that rejected papers should find a home. I'm all for that but I think that the safeguards to keep bad science out of the larger body of knowledge should be preserved. The good stuff has a way to get through eventually, witness the fact that those two papers eventually did get published.<p>With a name of 'rejecta mathematica' my guess would be that this will publish papers in the subfield of math that were not accepted elsewhere, so both papers listed in the article would have been rejected by 'rejecta mathematica' with an 'off topic' anyway, the 'card counting' example is a much better one for their subject.<p>Here is an article about an interesting side effect of being available online for free, it seems that just by having your paper online and freely accessible the chances of it being picked up and cited are substantially better than being published in some paper periodical:<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/e-access/Articles/lawrence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/e-access/Articles/lawre...</a><p>(funny that it should be on 'nature's site)",1248940903

That&#x27;s one of the positive things about Microsoft products.  The downside is that they have to deal with a lot of old baggage as a result.<p>Apple, on the other hand is almost the opposite.  They&#x27;re obsessive about upgrading everyone and leaving the past behind.  That&#x27;s great because they&#x27;re free to make bold and innovative changes.

All the participants need the ability to appreciate nuanced positions in order to gain value from weak opinions.<p>This isn&#x27;t unrelated, either; it&#x27;s one of the reasons that cliques form in the first place. The extreme position is inevitably simpler than moderate ones, and thus acts as a more solid common ground for group formation.

7417116,comment,7416189,7416931,3,0,pron,,,"When you&#x27;re a woman in tech and you&#x27;re hurt by the community reaction, here on HN as elsewhere, indignation certainly has its place. Catherine Bracy, the author of this post, is an expert on issues of sexism in Silicon Valley, and what she says should carry weight here. The article I posted yesterday was written in the early 70s, and discussed problems in different (though perhaps strangely similar) settings. The words of a modern day expert well versed in Silicon Valley culture should certainly find their place here. I think it reflects badly on this community that HN was allowed to be indignant in the Aaron Swartz and Ed Snowden cases but not in this. This high standard of not adding new information to the discussion was not applied in those cases, as I distinctly remember the front page flooded with at least 5 similar stories on Snowden/Swartz (articles were flagged back then only after a dozen or so stories, and we&#x27;re not there yet). In fact, HN should be reeling with indignation against all those who suddenly become cool observers and expert rhetoricians calling to suspend judgment.<p>Whatever the particulars of the GitHub scandal turn out to be don&#x27;t matter (for the purpose of this discussion). What better opportunity is there to discuss the very real problem of underrepresentation of women in SV than this? And what you call &quot;bait&quot; others might call raising awareness. This isn&#x27;t the NRA talking after a school shootout, but someone discussing what is possibly the biggest problem in SV culture today as a response to a painful, though far from tragic event.<p>I also find it problematic that a post by a prominent woman is found to be &quot;indignant and lacking in information&quot;, while far worse stupidities by race-car driving programmers are featured prominently. At the very least, I think some affirmative action wouldn&#x27;t hurt us. In fact, this could be our finest moment, and we&#x27;re squandering it.<p>ADD: it is perhaps ironic that Bracy implies that this revulsion from politics in SV is simply a form of a very destructive kind of politics, and flagging this story is precisely a case in point. It is a strong political statement that only nurtures what I think is very bad politics.<p>I urge you to unflag the story unless you strongly believe that its appearance on the front page is somehow bad for HN.",1395081749

Not all people with ADHD actually exhibit attention issues as their primary symptom, <i>or even at all</i>.<p>It&#x27;s like referring to depression as &quot;Excessive sleep disorder&quot;. Well, sure, excessive sleep is oftentimes a symptom of depression.

Rather it doesn&#x27;t have kernel thread support...all threads are user-level just like Python due to a global lock for garbage collection. This means threads do not run concurrently across multiple cores. This is UNACCEPTABLE in 2014 - roughly 8 years since processors went multi-core. Intel is talking about having hundreds of cores on a single die by next decade and having programs that can&#x27;t take advantage of that is extremely limiting.<p>Xavier Leroy (the creator of OCaml) and his team at INRIA didn&#x27;t think this was a big deal because when they were writing this stuff, processors were single core and had been since the beginning. Sure there were multiprocessor machines (not the same as multicore as there are multiple die), but those were only meant for servers/workstations. OCaml seemed very promising around 2006, the peak and end of the single core era with the Intel Pentium 4. What made OCaml so impressive was not only was it this beautifully simple, high-level functional language, but that the native compiler produced very fast code that was comparable to C/C++ performance. However, as multicore processors were introduced (Intel Core, Core 2), not having this capability made writing new code in OCaml less appealing. There are solutions like MPI, but that&#x27;s lame. The same excuses you hear in the Python world about having true multithreading you hear in the OCaml world. Microsoft was able to do it with F#, which is essentially a clone of Caml by targeting their .NET CLR. Haskell is able to do it with GHC.<p>I still think OCaml is a wonderful language -- not having true multithreading doesn&#x27;t make it useless. However, to me it has become more like a statically-typed Python which I can use for scripting. Having to use hacks like MPI to do multicore processing is a huge turn off in a multicore world. This is again nothing against the language, but the standard implementation needs a concurrent garbage collector and kernel threads. Otherwise I think OCaml may be doomed to irrelevance in the long run, which would be truly sad.",1395081317

We stopped the Internet filter, we pirate more than any other country, and we have Green party representatives in both houses of the national parliament.<p>I think a Bill of Rights is non-democratic in Westminster-judicial societies. Whereas in the US the judicial branch is somewhat accountable to the people, in the UK, Canada and Australia, the people&#x27;s will is only expressed in parliament. So, if the Australian parliament amended our constitution with a bill of rights, it would be handing power from our elected representatives to our non-elected High Court judges.<p>Furthermore, bills of rights are only superficial in protecting rights - they are always subject to the whim of the culture and society in which they operate. Canada has a bill of rights [0] supposedly protecting freedom of speech as a <i>fundamental right</i>, yet &quot;discriminatory speech&quot; is illegal (e.g. a comedian discriminating against homosexuals [1]).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-12.3/page-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-12.3/page-1.html</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2013/06/20/comedian-dinged-for-homophobic-rant-loses-constitutional-challenge-to-human-rights-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2013/06/20/comedian-dinged-for...</a><p>Sure, &quot;discriminatory speech&quot; has been ruled illegal in Australia too [2], but my point is: what&#x27;s the point of a bill of rights, then?<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/09/29/bolt-decision-irresponsible-journalism-illegal-think-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/09/29/bolt-decision-irresponsi...</a><p>Or, another example, look at how well the US&#x27; Fourth Amendment is protecting Americans from mass surveillance. I would posit that the reason the US has maintained more freedoms than other countries isn&#x27;t thanks to its Bill of Rights, but thanks to their cultural belief in the importance of liberty. (or maybe its their distrust of government oppression of liberty? I can&#x27;t tell)<p>So, as an Australian, I have no problem with not having a bill of rights. If we become a republic, and our High Court judges are then accountable to us? Maybe. But I&#x27;ll want to hear from respected law professors before making my mind up. See [3] for a good discussion, and links to reading material.<p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/q7xhm/what_are_the_arguments_for_a_bill_of_rights_what/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/q7xhm/what_are_the_a...</a><p>Anyway, more on-topic, I do agree with you that Australians need to step up their game to fight against authoritarianism.

There are multiple causative factors that can lead to ADHD symptoms, and what have traditionally been referred to as different subtypes of ADHD respond to different types of treatment.<p>This is hardly news! It is also where there are multiple treatment strategies for ADHD, until we get a better naming scheme in place (and make no mistake, the lack of proper names impacts both communication and how we think about the problem), we are stuck with using the catch all term ADHD. (Though some people have split into using ADHD-PI from primarily inattentive, it often doesn&#x27;t respond to stimulant treatment at all.)<p>Now I fundamentally disagree with the author&#x27;s final assertion that &quot;everyone is misdiagnosed&quot; is pure BS.<p>Primary evidence is that there are structural brain differences in people who have ADHD.

There is actually a solution to this problem - it&#x27;s called democracy. Every person gets the same amount of power - one vote, and they can decide things (or decide they don&#x27;t care). This is compatible with hierarchies, both formal and informal, but the authority is challenged all the time (which is a good thing). Some companies work like that, they are called worker cooperatives, but they are rare. Any eventual power cliques have hard time to be stable in such environment, because the power is equally distributed by default and according to a fixed, well-known rule. This actually allows participants to focus on production rather than politics.<p>But this is seldom what the owners of the company (who invested capital) want. They don&#x27;t want people to run things, they want people to run things on their behalf (and get rich from the process). And even if they were sympathetic to this idea, it&#x27;s very hard to grow such a company at all stages (in small group it&#x27;s very prone to hostile takeovers and later there is no incentive to grow, since the power of individuals is always the same compared to number of people).<p>I don&#x27;t see transition to democratic workplace happening unless lots of people give up any hope to have more power than other people.

Humans have used currencies such as gold which has a relatively fixed number of units in the past, which may have been less flexible but still worked. A currency does need to have some broad base of customary use and pricing, whether that be through social agreement or government fiat. People need JPY because their suppliers need JPY to pay their employees who have contracts in JPY or who need it to pay taxes to the government. They won&#x27;t take any other currency outright, and if they do, they will peg their prices such that they&#x27;ll be able to meet their obligations in JPY. This drives demand for the specific currency which helps set its value in the market.<p>For Silk Road type uses, people need <i>a</i> cryptocurrency or other pseudonymous way to transfer value, but do not need BTC specifically. Any sufficiently liquid crypto currency would work as a short-term transient store of value.

We should try and find better diagnoses and treatments, but it makes no sense to blast people by telling them their condition &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot;<p>If I have one complaint about the way we treat ADHD it&#x27;s a lack of education for patients. The medication is only one part of the solution and in my personal experience it&#x27;s nowhere near the biggest piece. Diet, environment, sleep, and exercise are just as crucial... but these are things I figured out on my own, not anything my doctors mentioned.<p><pre><code>  Firstly, addiction to stimulant medication is not \n  rare; it is common. The drugs’ addictive qualities \n  are obvious. We only need to observe the many patients\n  who are forced to periodically increase their dosage if   \n  they want to concentrate. \n</code></pre>\nThis true but disingenuous at best because it omits perspective in a way that borders on maliciousness. Adderall causes only a very mild dependence according to all studies I&#x27;ve ever read. The FDA and my personal experiences agree. I&#x27;ve discontinued my Adderall on a number of occasions (by responsibly tapering it down to 0mg over several days) and it was no problem.<p>To compare it to something most of us are familiar with: I found Adderall much easier to discontinue than caffeine, a thing I&#x27;ve never been able to quit. (I&#x27;ve never smoked, so I can&#x27;t compare with nicotine)<p>And to all those who say ADHD is a matter of &quot;willpower...&quot;<p>Maybe. For some.<p>I always told myself that too. I was born in 1976 so I went through school here in the USA right before they started diagnosing ADHD left and right and I was labeled a procrastinator instead. I never even really heard of ADHD until I was out of school.<p>After four years in college, which were a mix of promise and opportunities torpedoed by procrastination, I worked 10, 12, 14-hour days to finish work that I was more than talented enough to finish in 5 or 6 hours. My happiness suffered, health suffered, and relationships died.<p>Then I finally admitted that maybe it was a little more than a willpower issue. If it a matter of lacking willpower, why was I at the damn office trying to work long after everybody else had left? Whatever the hell my problem was, it wasn&#x27;t work ethic.<p>So I sought treatment... at the age of 32. And while medication was only an imperfect yet valuable part of the solution, my life has been on track again for a number of years.",1395079761

It&#x27;s a very reliable and advanced aircraft with tons of redundancy; things don&#x27;t just fail nowadays like they used to. Despite its age, there is absolutely zero reason why there should be a structural or mechanical failure. These aircraft aren&#x27;t Chevrolets, they&#x27;re built to stand up to daily abuse that they will likely never experience during their lifetime. Tell that to UPS and FedEx, which are still using 727s from the 70s.<p>Explosive decompression, even if it did happen, does not kill instantly. See also: Aloha Flight 243. Again, the 777 has very advanced pressurization systems. No reason that it should have killed everyone immediately.<p>Disintegration should have left debris. There was none.<p>Also, your statement about the 787 is irrelevant and misleading. The cracks found in the wings are hairline, and are caused by its composite construction. Things like this occur during the birth of an aircraft and get ironed out over the years, just like software. The 787 has nothing to do with the 777, which is a tried-and-true metal aircraft, and as I&#x27;ve reiterated before, age is irrelevant in these types of things. There has not been a single 777 fatality to date except the SFO Asiana disaster last year, which was caused by pilot error. The 777 seems to be a fairly bulletproof aircraft.<p>Conspiracy theories aren&#x27;t really the best approach to anything. Boeing has proven itself with the 777, and the 787 is a revolutionary design that will have some problems, just like the first jet engines did in the 50s.<p>Let&#x27;s leave the speculation to the NTSB and just tell who we love we love them.

We have enough resources to give everyone a good life and autonomy over their work, and it&#x27;s only getting better. Why do we set up these health-destroying tournaments of fools in the first place?<p>Didn&#x27;t the tournament of fools get us to the place where we can feed everyone?<p>> If we need to pick leaders, it will happen naturally. If we don&#x27;t, then why not have a looser arrangement where everyone has some autonomy?<p>I am reminded of the tyranny of structureless.<p>> some are very good people, if neurologically indistinguishable from murderers, because morality won&#x27;t show up on an MRI<p>This is implying a large amount of certainty about neuroscience knowledge that we simply do not have.<p>> We have this fucked-up culture of &quot;powering through&quot; that malaise. When it&#x27;s a hard biological issue (i.e. an infection or cancer or mental illness) it refuses to play by our rules. It&#x27;s not going to go away by &quot;downshifting&quot; at work or when we get that reward for being the last one standing. It&#x27;s imminently dangerous. But, in our culture of &quot;power through it and get the prize&quot;, most people don&#x27;t get the help they need until it&#x27;s too late.<p>I can agree here: our culture does a terrible job of helping people become emotionally adjusted individuals.  I do really <i>hate</i> the phrase &quot;hard biological issue&quot; when used to describe mental illness though.

The thing is Google and many of the Android device manufacturers really do thow shoddy goods out the door. not always, not every product, not every time, but embarrassingly often. Anyone remember the first generation Google TV boxes with unusable UIs in which vital controls would be completely hidden by other UI elements, rendering the whole thing essentially unusable? Even in the official unveiling demo they hit problems like that. Or the big push for Flash on Android in which, during the launch presentation, ever single attempt to run Flash lead to a crash and system lockup? Good times. Then there was the early nexus 7, with crippled flash memory drivers that led to chronic system performance degradation that they didn&#x27;t fix for a whole year.<p>Of course eventually some issues like this get fixed. The first few products may be duds, but the 3rd or 4th iteration might be quite good, and the fifth might be fantastic. Of course that&#x27;s where these companies want to get to. But meanwhile how many thousands of customers bought the first few versions? Who&#x27;s standing up for them?<p>Sure Apple can bring out duds too, products that fail to take off, or have serious limitations. Some of the early Macbook Airs couldn&#x27;t play full-screen video properly, but at least they could play video. When was the last time Apple brought out a product that was truly unfit for purpose?",1395079200

The elderly haven't been revered as the only repository of wisdom since the invention of writing, and the invention of the press accelerated the process. It made sense for villagers to take the outliers to the elders, because they were the only ones with some chance of having relevant experience, but their influence diminished as books became common and cheap. The elderly became mostly cheap labor for menial tasks like mending clothes or going to the bank, the kind of work that automation eliminates.",1256903025

911853,story,,,21,11,transatlantic,"Ask HN: Good feature, minimal product. Go forward or move on to something else?",,"I'm interested in local search, specifically in terms of time. Yelp and Citysearch are great at telling you about businesses you've never tried, but if you want to find out when a given business is open it's pretty hit or miss. Those sites usually list business hours for the trendy restaurant across town, but when it comes to the small market down the corner you're on your own. If you're like me, even though you've been to that market ten times you still can't remember if it closes at 10:30 or 11:00. But you're hungry, so you walk 10 minutes to get there anyway. And of course it's closed. It'll take another 10 minutes to walk back home and you're still hungry.<p>It's annoying, it's a big waste of time, and it's a problem I've always wanted some local search tool to solve. Like Yelp, Google and other major search engines are only helpful some of the time. A lot of small players have tried to take on the problem, but most have been hamstrung by data that's woefully incomplete or just plain bad. It's a pretty hard nut to crack, in large part because half of the restaurants in a typical city don't even have a website. Data collection is a complete pain in the ass.<p>Still, I've created something that solves the problem really well. It only covers about a third of one large city as a proof of concept, but it's really helpful. Looking for beer at 3:00 in the morning? Wondering when the DMV office opens? Searching for one of the three places in town that actually serves teriyaki on a Sunday? This app can tell you all of that. If a business isn't open, it'll tell you about similar ones in the area that are. It's just a click to read reviews of the place on sites like Yelp and Citysearch, get directions, etc. It's exactly the product I've always wanted someone else to create.<p>But that's the rub: it's not really a product; it's just a feature. I'd love to refine the thing, gather loads of information, and roll it out in major cities across the country. It's perfect for a mobile application. It's easy enough for anyone to understand and comprehensive enough for anyone to get value from. But once the data's out there, it'd also be incredibly easy to recreate. There's a definitive first mover advantage, but it would only go so far. This is all a big concern for me; even though I know that a lot of people would use the app and enjoy it, generating revenue is important. Solving this problem on a large scale will require several years of hard work on my part, so there needs to be some sort of sustainable path to get there.<p>Assume you're in my position. What do you do? Is there some way to build a product around the feature and create a company with a chance at making money? Or do you leave it to an established business with more resources to add the feature to an existing product?",1256902728

911849,comment,911170,911170,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"After reading a lot of comments in a lot of threads like this one on a lot of sites, I've noticed a particular factor which sticks out: people who direct this sort of commentary at education in the US almost all seem to have attended very large universities.<p>I did not attend such a university, and my experience of ""academics"" was rather different from what's described in the linked comment; there were some things that I know were unusual about the way my college education was structured, and that not even all of the students there were getting the same level of or approach to education, but I suspect that there's a fundamental difference between large and small schools. The larger the institution, the more ""efficient"" it has to be with the resources at hand; this seems to lead naturally to the sort of bulk-processed ""memorize this and regurgitate it on an exam"" approach being complained about here. A smaller institution, meanwhile, isn't under the same pressure to move large volumes of students through its curriculum, and can afford to do things differently. I'm well aware that mine did, and thankful every day for that fact.",1256901925

I wouldn't and didn't downvote you based on that comment, but certainly wouldn't upvote. I suspect if you'd phrased it differently and maybe made it a little more useful, people would have responded differently, e.g. ""I really admire these calculator hackers, it's amazing what can be done on these simple machines, e.g. these cool games: [link], [link] and [link].""<p>The HN userbase appreciates a high signal/noise ratio. Merely calling something ""cool"" is considered noise.<p>Hope that helps.",1256901773

I guess I thought a userfriendly distro should be friendly to the user by providing me info I didn't know I needed to ask up front, and hiding things that are merely technically interesting or edge case.  Disk space is probably the former.  Asking me to ""just google it"" is probably not the response Ubuntu/Canonical or any other product would want.<p>BTW, since it crashed on install instead of catching that my partitions weren't large enough, that's a fail.  But by merely providing the info on the DL page, they might have saved themselves some credibility loss as a ""user friendly"" distro.<p>But I do appreciate that you didn't throw a lmgtfy.com link in, which would have been really embarrassing for me.",1256900835
911838,comment,908226,911490,0,0,dkersten,,,"RISC core and microcoded CISC instructions then?<p>Still, what I meant was that the processor contains logic for some virtual machine style operations, eg keeping track of objects on the heap on-chip (or in a dedicated segment of ram/virtual address space) and having a hardware garbage collector. The main instruction set would still be RISC, but it would contain a small number of CISC instructions for allocating memory which the garbage collector then manages.<p>As for dynamic dispatch, I guess thats not really needed, since it can be constructed from simpler instructions, but having a Python-style method dictionary lookup for member functions be performed in hardware could be interesting.<p>Finally, if a processor had reflection and introspection features.. eg data is annotated in memory so that the structure and state of a program can be determined melodramatically at runtime (and modified).<p>Actually, while writing this, I realise that this probably doesn't really make much sense... :-/",1256900725

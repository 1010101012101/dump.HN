1024750,comment,1024657,1024657,0,0,SlyShy,,,"The publishing industry needs to change, and it should take Steam as its example.<p>The way I see it, the economics of publishing are entirely backwards right now. A creative producer, who wishes to distribute their goods to the masses, should look for a distributer in a competitive market. The current system is that the distributer looks for creative producers, and filters out lots of artists that it doesn't think will be successful. This is as absurd as a trucking company looking to nurture manufacturing businesses so it has more things to ship.<p>Let's consider the issue of pirating. It's not a false dichotomy to state there are two kinds of pirates. The kind that can afford the item they are pirating, and the kind that can't.<p>If someone pirates an item because they can't afford it, the producer isn't losing any potential income, because the pirate has none to give regardless. Stamping down on this kind of piracy is pointless.<p>If someone pirates an item they can afford, however, then you've got problems. What this indicates is that someone found pirating to be more convenient than the legal way of buying the item. Would people really buy more items instead of pirating them if it was more convenient and pleasant to buy the item legally? Steam certainly indicates so. Take a look at the thousands of Reddit comments on steam. One of the remarkable themes that emerges from those comments is this kind, ""Downloaded this from Steam, even though I already own the CDs, because I didn't feel like looking for them"" or ""Bought it on Steam after I torrented it"". (If you don't believe me, seriously, look for youself. Also note that Reddit users are basically the demographic of people who pirate out of convenience.)<p>What this indicates is that traditional publishing as done in the film, book, or game industries haven't been keeping pace with the consumer's desire for convenience. You can blame an uncompetitive market for that. If creative producers were able to select from a gamut of publishing companies and evaluate cost versus effectiveness of sales, etc., then publishers would be forced to innovate. And also to offer better deals to artists.<p>Of course, the established industry is resistent to change, which is why we are getting all of this DRM. They are approaching the problem of downloading for convenience in exactly the wrong way. Instead of trying to make purchasing games, music, movies, and books more convenient (like Steam has done with games) they are trying to make pirating less convenient. Guess which approach would be more efficient, but would actually take some thought and overhaul of the current system? Amazon is moving in the right direction with the Kindle.",1262285635

1024737,comment,1024301,1024408,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>I'm quite sure it's not a tragedy that children don't have access to computers</i><p>This is an example of a radical opinion that one might expect to be downvoted for disagreement here on HN, but I see (from current net upvotes) that others agree, or at least think the comment contributes to the discussion here. I'll expand on this a bit, from my perspective as a parent of wealthy-country children who have long had access to computers. Of course I grew up without ready computer access. Children having personal computers with online access is, like most of human life, a TRADE-OFF. I think computers are wonderful tools and helpful for self-directed learning, but they are also enormous time sinks and distractions from books and many hands-on activities. Current research doesn't unambiguously show that computer use contrasted with nonuse is even an advantage for learning K-12 academic subjects. (Some studies appear to show academic achievement going down as computer use goes up in developed countries.) The role of easy telecommunications in fostering economic development seems beyond dispute, but voice telephony and an efficient postal system for adults may go most of the way to providing that benefit, without all children needing an Internet-connected laptop.<p>I have lived in poor countries, which is why I am conscious that where money is scarce, one must think about what way of spending money produces the best results. The OLPC project certainly had noble goals, and strove to be inexpensive, but perhaps the countries the project intended to serve need something else more urgently.",1262285357

The developer assigns a desired rank to each URI (or NA if he just ranks the top few) and compares this to the computed rank (as a function of the features, e.g. visitation time, visitation frequency, etc.).<p>A few rounds of this on different computers and eventually the coefficients settle such that the computed rank matches the desired rank most of the time. Moreover the process is more transparent and can be re-run should new features be included.",1262282698

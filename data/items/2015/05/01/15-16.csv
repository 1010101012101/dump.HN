9472324,comment,9469806,9470785,0,0,jccooper,,,"At the moment, true, and Blue Origin is not renowned for their development speed, but suborbital is clearly just a stepping stone for them. Their suborbital booster uses liquid hydrogen as a fuel, which is a very good fuel but so obscenely cold that you don&#x27;t want to use it unless you really have to. So it&#x27;s mostly reserved for upper stages where efficiency really matters. (For suborbital a much easier, but less powerful, fuel like alcohol would be fine.)<p>And given that they already have a much larger methane engine under development, this suborbital stage seems to be an early revenue-generating version of a future second stage of an EELV (Falcon 9/Atlas V) class launch vehicle. And probably, like SpaceX, they will be targeting VTVL recovery.<p>This is actually really good news for launch prices, because without a real competitor with reusable vehicles (and none of the incumbents seem capable of this in any reasonable time frame) SpaceX will have no reason to drop prices much below expendable costs (other than benevolence). Blue Origin could probably field a Falcon 9-equivalent in a few years, and even if they don&#x27;t the prospect should keep SpaceX on their toes.",1430495957

Excuses for why they are dysfunctional don&#x27;t change the fact that they are dysfunctional.<p>> They get 1000s of applications, so they need to filter them, it&#x27;s time that&#x27;s far to important to spend on a developer, I mean they are short of them too.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many applications a big company receives as a whole. If you&#x27;ve posted a job posting for a specific job, you&#x27;re lucky to receive 10s of applications, let alone 1000s. And given that a hire will affect the productivity of the team every second of every day for years, spending an hour filtering applications is absolutely a worthwhile investment of developer time.<p>And if applications are handled at the corporate level for a large corporation, the hiring process is fundamentally broken. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s okay to have unqualified people filtering applications, it means that you should be posting jobs for specific teams rather than for the whole company.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at large companies where applications were filtered by a central office and it showed in the quality of applications we received. I ended up drawing from my local community instead and this was a big part of why our team outperformed others at the company.<p>> So I&#x27;ll stick it on, probably in a format that makes it obvious to a technical person, I consider this an expansion of the bullet point technology.<p>You&#x27;re only doing yourself a disservice by catering to organizations with crappy hiring practices.

The news all too often brings word of yet another compromise, exposing financial information, personal details, or simply salacious pictures.  Whatever the impact, it&#x27;s clear the technology industry has a problem, and there are few easy solutions.<p>Some seek legislation to impose harsher penalties on the responsible parties.  This ignores the fact that many of those responsible are outside the jurisdictions which seek to punish them.  In some cases, they may have tacit approval of their own government, or even be operating on their government&#x27;s behalf.  Others turn to established security products looking for antivirus and network filtering technologies to add protection.  This is an also an imperfect solution.  It places the defender in a reactive posture, responding only to those threats which have been previously detected, and for which countermeasures have been developed.  There&#x27;s no perfect solutions.<p>At Matasano, we believe the best way to combat security weaknesses is at their source; by discovering and remediating software vulnerabilities before others leverage them for ill effect.  Our clients see the value in this approach.  We&#x27;re engaged to work on some of the most interesting and important software on the planet.  Aside from identifying vulnerabilities, we help our clients identify the root cause.  Through this, they can adjust processes to reduce the likelihood of similar problems in the future, while increasing their ability to identify and correct them.  The goal is more resilient software.<p>We&#x27;ve assessed hot startup web applications, low level device firmware, mobile platforms, and everything in between.  With this breadth, we have need for employees skilled in frameworks like Node, Rails, Django, and Spring.  We need people comfortable with x86 and ARM assembly, reverse engineering, and binary protocol analysis.  If you&#x27;re skilled in a programming language with the letter &#x27;C&#x27; in it, that&#x27;s desirable.  Newer safer languages like Rust and Golang are in demand.  In short if you share our focus on helping secure our software ecosystem one piece at a time and want a chance to do something about it, we should talk.<p>Learn about our hiring process at <a href=""http://www.matasano.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/careers</a> or contact us at careers@matasano.com\nGet a taste for some of what we do at <a href=""http://www.microcorruption.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microcorruption.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.cryptopals.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cryptopals.com</a>\nCheck out our blog at <a href=""http://chargen.matasano.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chargen.matasano.com</a><p>Next month, you&#x27;ll notice a change in these posts.

We believe that what we&#x27;re working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $5m funding and have a small team of 10 applied machine learning experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges.<p>We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas/Numpy/etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world.\nWe&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD/PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together. In addition, we’re looking for a senior business development person.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=""http://www.enlitic.com/team.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enlitic.com/team.html</a> .

I&#x27;m fond of saying, &quot;It&#x27;s how you bring it.&quot; You want to be someone that &quot;brings it.&quot; You want to be firing on all cylinders.<p>And so, this feeling of self-worth is tied to every single moment, not to results, which are ultimately ephemeral, and are only a small piece of the equation. Ultimately, results will fade, and may not always be what you expected anyway. But, if you focus on execution and process, you will be better-served to end the emotional roller-coaster of self-doubt, because you will know that you are bringing it, you will know that, &quot;No matter what the results are, I delivered to the best of my ability.

Standing desks can help, but standing for 6-8 hours is probably just as bad as sitting. Do walking meetings if possible, and take frequent breaks. sSometimes I&#x27;ll take conference calls with a headset and stretch in my office. Use a Pomodoro app to remind yourself to stretch or change position every 25 minutes or so.<p>2. Lots of people who sit for most of the day have lumbar lordosis or weak hip flexors (I did). To check if you have this problem, stand to the side in front of a mirror. Does it look like your butt sticks out and your lower spine curves in?  (See here: <a href=""http://stronglifts.com/lordosis-why-it-causes-lower-back-pain-how-to-fix-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stronglifts.com/lordosis-why-it-causes-lower-back-pai...</a>). The other way you can test this is attempt to do a &quot;hollow rock&quot; (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4-uLTL4v4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4-uLTL4v4</a>). Is that hard/impossible? You probably have lumbar lordosis, weak hip flexors, weak abs or all of the above.<p>This can be hard to fix, but not impossible. It&#x27;s doing to take a few months, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. The way I did it was to just do Crossfit. It&#x27;s really hard to do this on your own and keep your motivation up and Crossfit solves that problem. Most Crossfit exercises require you to have an &quot;explosive&quot; hip thrust which will strengthen and stretch your core.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to do Crossfit, kettle bells seem to be the exercises in Crossfit that stretch and strengthen the hip flexors most for me.

Identify industry with big inefficiencies that depends on huge government subsidies. That&#x27;s cars, commercial space vehicles, mass transit and now: colonizing another planet with the 0.1%.\n2. Convince the media and envious government officials you are Tom Swift, boy inventor. Have these governments fight over how many billions to give you to build your space car factory.\n2. Use these taxpayer dollars and gigantic tax breaks to create iconic products and services for the elite class, effectively transferring huge dollars from the poor to the rich.\n3. Rinse and repeat.<p>I see no evidence at all that Musk cares any more about technologies to enable several billion of us to live together without slaughtering each other than he does about money.<p>Add the utility business to the growing list of government supported industries Musk wants to &quot;disrupt&quot; by which I mean establish a publicly funded, government subsidized mechanism to siphon off dollars for himself, just like Tony Stark in fact. The electricity generating and distribution system is one of the most provably useful &quot;common goods&quot; in the history of the human race-- why not convince people to spend more than 10 grand to power their house for 24 hours?<p>His reasons:<p>Load Shifting - residences generally have NO economic incentive to ride the demand curve, only businesses do in some cases. It is one of the most important things about the electrical system--these huge monopolies manage that curve collectively for us. Sure, transmission is inefficient, but so is decentralizing that task, while adding the risks of keeping your battery from breaking/catching fire.<p>Increasing self consumption- a battery does not stimulate this at all - the grid needs your power most when the sun is shining. Solar power and an inverter provides that incentive today.<p>Backup - One day of power in the event of a true natural disaster for $10,000 is expensive and not sufficient.<p>I am not a Luddite and I am a libertarian, and certainly our society needs technology visionaries right now, but I find Musk&#x27;s increasingly cynical ploys and the adulation they receive pretty annoying.

That way, website owners who want to keep their status quo, can just add a self signed cert and their users will be none the wiser.<p>For https there are two major objectives. 1) Prevent MITM attacks. 2) Prevent snooping from passive monitoring. Self-signed certs can prevent #2, which the IETF has adopted as a Best Current Practice (<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7258"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7258</a>). I&#x27;m much more in favor of trying to at least do one of the two objectives of https, rather than refusing to do anything until we are able to do both objectives.<p>Here&#x27;s a proposed way of phasing this plan in over time:<p>1. Mid-2015: Start treating self signed certificates as unencrypted connections (i.e. stop showing a warning, but the UI would just show the globe icon, not the lock icon). This would allow website owners to choose to block passive surveillance without causing any cost to them or any problems for their users.<p>2. Late-2015: Switch the globe icon for http sites to a gray unlocked lock. The self signed certs would still be the globe icon. The would incentivize website owners to at least start blocking passive surveillance if they want to keep the same user experience as previous. Also, this new icon wouldn&#x27;t be loud or intrusive to the user.<p>3. Late-2016: Change the unlocked icon for http sites to a yellow icon. Hopefully, by the end of 2016, Let&#x27;s Encrypt has taken off and has a lot of frameworks like wordpress including tutorials on how to use it. This increased uptake of free authenticated https, plus the ability to still use self-signed certs for unauthenticated https (remember, this still blocks passive adversaries), would allow website owners enough alternative options to start switching to https. The yellow icon would push most over the edge.<p>4. Late-2017: Switch the unlocked icon for http to red. After a year of yellow, most websites should already have switched to https (authenticated or self-signed), so now it&#x27;s time to drive the nail in the coffin and kill http on any production site with a red icon.<p>5. Late-2018: Show a warning for http sites. This experience would be similar to the self-signed cert experience now, where users have to manually choose to continue. Developers building websites would still be able to choose to continue to load their dev sites, but no production website would in their right mind choose to use http only.<p>Here&#x27;s two relevant Bugzilla bugs:<p>Self-signed certificates are treated as errors: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=431386"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=431386</a><p>Switch generic icon to negative feedback for non-https sites: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041087"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041087</a>",1430494014

The suggestions are clear and actionable. I&#x27;d try to explain them here, but honestly the book will do it way better.<p>I think that the key for me is to check in with my muscles. When my posture isn&#x27;t right, I can feel it because the muscles on one side or another (or forward and backwards) of my spine or neck are slightly tense.<p>I&#x27;ve found that not everyone seems to be able to monitor whether a muscle is engaged or not, but if you can, that&#x27;s a tell-tale sign that your posture isn&#x27;t neutral. I learned this technique from many years of karate, honestly no idea if it&#x27;s transferrable if you don&#x27;t do any physical activity. I feel like it should be possible, but maybe 10% of people I&#x27;ve described it to can feel it.<p>Other thing that I know for sure is that physical activity will repair a lot of the damage you can do to your body. When I <i>don&#x27;t</i> do karate for more than about three weeks, my lower back starts hurting (old injury). Regularly not just stretching it out, but working the muscles in those areas by rotating at the hips (in my case with karate punches) smoothly and repeatedly seems to get a lot of blood flow to the affected area, work out deep muscle spasms that are pulling my spine out of alignment, and basically smooths out the action of the joints in the spine. I&#x27;m not sure biking or running would help, but I bet swimming would. Needs to be a fairly full body exercise with rotation action around the axis of your spine I think... at least for lower back.",1430493999

That is drugged up people don&#x27;t contribute to society and makes people lazy.  It also means the government has less influence on these people.

Walking helps align your posture.<p>* Get a good chair, not necessary an expensive one, you want a chair which supports your back and has your legs supporting some of your weight.<p>* Doing minimal yoga or stretching is key even if it&#x27;s for 5 minutes, do not do yoga that stresses your back or twists anything! I do 5 minuets of exercise 3 times a day.<p>* Strengthen your core muscles and your glutes. You don&#x27;t need a 6 pack but it certainly helps.<p>* Engage your abductors often, you can engage some of them any-time you think about them (sort of like holding back when you have to urinate).<p>* Try to feel your muscles (meditation can help here), you will often notice they are tense or perhaps you are just tense in general. Try and relax, breath and generally loosen up. Getting a massage can also help and thermotherapy is a godsend.",1430493256

It&#x27;s more of a &#x27;release&#x27;.<p>After many years of sitting, the hip muscles tighten, atrophy, and lose their ability to rotate the hip. The hip stays tight (flexed) and the thigh muscles (and others) end up taking over the role of keeping your body upright.<p>This works, but stresses these muscles, since they weren&#x27;t designed for it. This stretch (or release) convinces the thigh to &#x27;let go&#x27; of your hip, allowing it to rotate. This has positive effects all the way up your body, especially in the load-bearing joints: ankles, knees, hips, shoulders.<p>In severe cases, you might need to wait a very long time for this release. My right thigh takes about 40 minutes to release completely.

9471884,comment,9469266,9469266,0,0,throwawaykf05,,,"Oh, I see binarybits is at it again! Just a few corrections:<p>1. Android makers don&#x27;t necessarily pay Microsoft for patents on things that were invented in Windows Phone. They pay licenses for patents that relate to either a) computers in general, or b) that you could do on mobile devices in general. Examples include the infamous FAT patent, patents on low-level concurrency primitives, and patents on synchronizing calendar clients. &quot;Good&quot; patents? I don&#x27;t know. But it&#x27;s disingenuous to compare Android to Windows Phone because a) it implies Android is licensing stuff that came later, and b) from a product that is inferior, insinuating these patents are low quality. If I were uncharitable, I&#x27;d say Google ordered a hit piece after all the love Microsoft has been getting the past couple of days!<p>2. The &quot;billions of dollars spent on patents instead of hiring engineers&quot; argument is a red herring. Firstly, these companies <i>cannot</i> find enough &quot;good&quot; engineers to hire, which is why they&#x27;re lobbying for more H1s. Is their bar too high? Maybe. Or they may justly be concerned about allowing a &quot;bozo explosion&quot;. And even if they <i>did</i> hire more engineers, they still have billions of dollars left over. Patents are designed to be a risk to those that would not reward inventions they practice, and reducing risk to the company is a fine way of spending that money,<p>3. Using these patents to crush future competition? These companies can more easily crush competition by buying them up rather than suing them. A 2009 study found only a small fraction of lawsuits involve large companies suing smaller ones: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1396319"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1396319</a> - and I would bet none of the large tech companies would risk the PR fallout.<p>4. There is no &quot;patent litigation crisis&quot;, just increased media coverage of litigation that is more or less in line with historical rates. Less than 2% of active patents are ever asserted and only a fraction of a percent ever make it to trial. See studies by Mark Lemley, for instance. The &quot;smartphone wars&quot; were just a drop in the bucket of all other patent litigation that happens. In fact there were higher rates of litigation in history when major technical developments happened: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id="" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=</a>",1430492940

The CA proposition a few years back had a clause in there that made it very difficult.  Calling addiction a &quot;medical issue&quot; makes it even worse because the differences between recreational use and addiction aren&#x27;t that easy to distinguish.\n-The individual should pay for all of their own issues, medical expenses, etc due to drug addiction.  Many of the advocates not only want legalization (because it&#x27;s their choice, their body) but none of the consequences that come along with it (medical bills due to addiction).  It&#x27;s unfair for me, as an individual that chooses not to put those drugs into my body to also have rising medical costs that pay for the people that willingly ingest drugs.\n-Tort reform.

Many people use AC&#x27;s as a counterpoint to 2kW battery packs, whereas actually it&#x27;s one of the more appropriate cases to use solar panels combined with (relatively) cheap local storage for nighttime consumption!<p>How much is your power bill in summer? Must be $300+, going on 500 during the hottest months? At that rate, you&#x27;ll make back the $20k + $10k that 10k Wp + 2 of these batteries would cost you in what, 5 to 7 years?

How about the risks posed by more &#x27;mundane&#x27; devices like computer monitors?<p>Anyone who has seen the movie &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; probably remembers how an epileptic seizure played an important role in the story.\nWhat if firmware in a modern flatscreen monitor were tweaked, before it being shipped to a specific customer, to program the video circuits to emit a seizure-inducing (or hypnotizing) display pattern the moment the person sitting in front of it opens an email message with some innocuous looking graphical pattern in it acting as a trigger?<p>As I see it, this example and others like it demonstrate the   possibility of very specific, targeted attacks on peoples&#x27; health. One out of a huge arsenal of possible attacks, which need or need not be specific to one person or a particular group. All of them made possible by our ever increasing reliance on technology over which we have little or no real control.<p>If the history of hacking and unconventional use of technology has taught us anything, it is that not the things one thinks are possible, but rather the things that one hasn&#x27;t thought of as being possible, are those that really count.<p>I&#x27;m very interested in your opinions on this matter.",1430492451

Your self-worth should be derived from people who value you for more than your work.  It should be derived from someone valuing <i>you</i> not any sort of external criteria.  It could be your wife/husband, your dog, your God, or whomever, but ultimately it boils down to <i>you</i> learning to value yourself beyond these things.<p>I used to put an intense amount of my self-worth into my work.  A totally unhealthy amount.  I felt good about myself because I was in my early 20&#x27;s, writing books, being invited to speak at international conferences, working at the hottest startups, making a bunch of money.  I was building my self image around this empire of dirt that I&#x27;d cobbled together based on how good of a programmer I am (and how well I could network).  Then I tried to start a consultancy, which didn&#x27;t work out great.  I tried to build products there, that failed.  I got fired from my next job.  I felt like utter crap because I didn&#x27;t understand why I was being personally punished and devalued.  My work had betrayed me!<p>But it was at this point that I had to realize that anyone or anything that judged me by my work or my ability to work at the cool startup or my ability to be a part of some project wasn&#x27;t judging me at all.  They were judging my work, and I can&#x27;t let my value and self image be tied up in that.  For me, the first person I needed to teach that lesson to was myself.<p>And I did.  And it wasn&#x27;t fun.  It&#x27;s not fun to totally change your worldview, but oh my gosh, I feel so much better about life now.  Not feeling like I live and die by the work I do frees me to do some of the best work I&#x27;ve done in my whole life.  Sure, I&#x27;m not working at America&#x27;s Next Great Startup and sure I&#x27;m not speaking at 2 conferences a month and sure I&#x27;m not signing up book deals all the time now, but holy crap I&#x27;m so much happier.<p>So, yes.   People experience this exact thing.  And it can crush you.  But please don&#x27;t let it.  Find the worth within yourself and surround yourself with things and people that will support that.",1430492425

I&#x27;m making this code available because it makes the research world stronger. If someone else extends it, I&#x27;d like to encourage them to share the code back to the community. So, the GPL comes up of my own volition.<p>In the case of prose, though, I want people to be clear whose words are whose. Even changing a word or two can change the meaning of the document significantly. The GNU FDL appears to address this sort of thing, but doesn&#x27;t apply to code.<p>In this case, the prose is laden with included code, so I&#x27;m sitting between licenses.",1430492412

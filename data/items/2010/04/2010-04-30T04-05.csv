I don't just dismiss it as stupid and evil.<p>There are 2 things that stand out to me which aren't being discussed.  1) Apple has maybe the very best record in supporting their customers' software through various multiplatform upgrades.    If you've been on board with them,  they've taken you from 68000 to PowerPC to Intel and they've had bloody seamless transitions.    Perhaps that has something to do with their desire to specify how apps are built and which tools are used to build them.  FWIW, they did their own iPad chip but they bought one off the shelf for iPhone,  I'd imagine that they will have their own phone chip before too long.  This just seems logical and sensical to me and it's possible they might alter the architecture in some way and maybe want to dynamically translate the existing apps.<p>2) If you look at iPhone and iPad, they clearly had some foresight and vision when they did the phone.  They didn't accidentally build the iPad and it turned out to run the same software and be compatible.   Perhaps there is something else that they have in mind in the coming years or two.    Maybe you'll be able to use app store apps on AppleTV.  Who knows, maybe there will be some other device too.",1272602486

It'd take more dev time to implement that, I just wanted to get a bare bones out, but I'm taking notes :)<p>2) From what I understand, search.twitter.com, well they have their own special secret-sauce-laced algorithm; and outside looking in I don't know how they relate, but from what I've tested, it's different. public_timeline is a very small subset of the <i>total</i> tweets in the world. Basically, every 60 seconds they give you a snapshot of 20 tweets, randomly picked from the Twitter universe. With search.twitter.com, you're searching for something specific (public timeline is 100% random)<p>3) Good to know, noted.<p>4) I thought about a rate limiter, but to need a rate limiter,  you've either (a) entered a filter that is overly generic (since it's matching over aggressively) -or- (b) you genuinely are seeing that many tweets with a similar pattern that matches the filter.<p>In the case of (a), you'd have to make your filter less aggressive. In the case of (b), then you must be a ""power"" power user.

I guess then I will throw in a ""randomizer"" to include a slight variation in the response ;)<p>And on the last point, I was thinking the same .. the percentage of people who might find this useful is probably not the bulk of Tweet-izens :/ But it was a fun exercise for me, and I thought I'd put it out there for the world and see if anyone cares!",1272602411

1307186,comment,1306883,1307153,0,0,qeorge,,,"Hey Jay, thanks for your detailed response.<p>1) The problem is this:<p>If I set up a new ""filter"", I have to wait until someone triggers it to see what my response will look like. In my case, that could be days or weeks. So it would be great to preview this in some way - ideally, it would scan the timeline and show what I would have responded to, were the filter already engaged. Does that make any sense?<p>2) public_timeline is the same pool as search.twitter.com, right? I'm interested in Twitter's policy here, as I could see them disapproving of my sending messages to strangers in response to keywords. OTOH, I see people do this all the time, so maybe its a non-issue.<p>3) Thanks. That would be a great feature. I know my tweets are public anyway, but I'd like to avoid displaying that I am using an automated service.<p>4) A count would be great, maybe even rate limiting per response (e.g., don't send this message more than once per hour).<p>Regarding spamminess, I definitely agree that its all about usage. For instance, if someone mentions my brand, I don't think an auto-response is spammy at all. If I'm scanning for anyone mentioning DVDs so I can push my affiliate link, that's entirely different.<p>For my brand specifically, my concern would be that the responses were so generic that they would come across as spammy. Basically, I'm nervous about automating any part of my communications with my customers.<p>Note: even though this might not be a fit for my small business, simply because we don't have that much twitter volume, I think it would be really useful to many others.

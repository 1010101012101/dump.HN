Bugs are usually<p>a) a misinterpreation of the requirements (no amount of comments are going to save you) or<p>b) a (hopefully) subtle error in the code - again - I don't see how a comment is going to help you unless the comment is practically pseudo-code which I (hope) nobody is advocating.<p>Anyone have an example of the typical type of bug that is easier to fix when there are comments around? I agree about commenting ""non-obvious"" code though - at least in terms of it's intentions. Not necessarily as a way to fix bugs, but to prevent the next programmer from removing something that looks superfluous because nobody can remember why it's there.

Because publishers traditionally sold to wholesalers who sold to bookstores, they don't routinely sell direct to the public. A move by any of the big publishers to set up a direct-sales channel for ebooks, rivaling Amazon or Barnes and Noble, would probably be seen as hostile or monopolistic by the bookseller trade, and might even generate anti-trust lawsuits!

I understand that a move to systemd and in the future to wayland will have problematic consequences for BSD support. But the changes are made for good reasons and to bring the Linux and Free Software Desktop forward.<p>Systemd is much better for Desktop uses. The major reason is that it is fully designed to support hotplug. Which is something you have to constantly deal with on Desktop/Laptop systems. Disks are plugged in, Network connection isn't ready, and so on. It is also much faster and has a lot of other nice features. The lack of systemd support in *Ubuntu might be the reason for me to switch to another distribution for my Desktop.<p>Wayland finally allows us to get rid off all the legacy crap we have to carry around with X11. There is a reason why it is developed by the Xorg devs.<p>Pulseaudio had its reasons as well. Such as having useful support for Bluetooth- or USB-audio. Per-application audio settings and so on.<p>Of course you can argue with certain details in certain implementations. But I don't think that we can argue about the problems those solutions solve. Maybe you are happy with the setup you've been using since the 90s. But for most people the times are changing.<p>It is certainly sad that the BSDs don't have the manpower to keep up. However we can not expect the Linux Desktop to stand still because of them. The Linux Desktop itself lacks manpower and is fighting an uphill battle.

I'm married, because I'm quite certain that I want to stay with this person, because of tax benefits and a clearly defined situation for offsprings (from 'parental rights' to banal things like 'last name of the little one').<p>Without that, I couldn't care less about marriage (yes, my wife knows that pov). I'm not religious, so all the reasons for marriage listed there don't apply. Looking at society I think that - depending on the country/region/culture, I guess - marriage lost its meaning.<p>You might disagree and think that marriage is still an important concept, but in that case I'd argue that divorce shouldn't be ~that easy~. That doesn't mix in my world. The _only_ value of marriage, subjective of course, is the binding vow to stay with someone, period. Reducing that to ""Yeah, 'til death or .. something else"" is really nonsense, in absolute terms.<p>I love my wife, but my signature & vow aren't better than a vow I presented her on a random beach in France, with no witnesses.<p>Ignoring my impression of the value of marriage: Lots of people around me (and my former self certainly as well) seem to be less tolerant. If it's more and more easy to find a new partner (the original article mentions finding people on craigslist..), why would you invest time and energy in this current relationship, that goes through a hard time? The incentive is lowered: You can find people easily (online, offline), society doesn't really care if you were married before in general (certainly not everywhere, but in the western countries I know that's the case) and getting a divorce is ~easy~ (although, potentially nasty/expensive/etc). Why should you work hard to overcome problems in a relationship where a lot of the initial giddy feeling stuff is gone (substituted with something just as good perhaps, if you're happy. But .. in times of crisis you'll probably forget about that)?<p>Let's get back to the question, shall we? In a word, in my expectation, the reason for a high rate of divorce is:<p>Lazyness",1352725991

I'm not sure which was more painful or was more broken by design, though SMF surely affected more developers.<p>If I were making decisions for OpenBSD I would not accept a requirement to port an init replacement, but I also wouldn't be putting any resources into keeping Gnome running that could go into better integration with an alternative.<p>While it is nice to be able to mix and match everything rather than having choose a silo, having these large market share players like gnome dictate changes on every platform is ultimately rather destructive to having meaningful options.<p>I would rather run the Linux kernel for practical reasons, and often use gnome for practical reasons though I would be thrilled not to.<p>Showing me you can keep up with Linux running gnome isn't compelling at all, particularly if it means you are no longer doing much else. But if you can better integrate with KDE or enlightenment (or fvwm and some duct tape,) and give me an alternative to linux+gnome then I'll deal with a new kernel (and not having PAM?!)",1352725418

4772630,comment,4771879,4771879,1,0,frontsideair,,,"This was supposed to be my dream setup too. I got a Raspberry Pi which is gathering dust on the shelf now. I was so eager to use it when it came out, then I had a faulty microSD card and lost all spirit to turn it into a credit card-sized media center. I hope if I can find some spare time, and a working SD card, I'll achieve this goal.<p>I also needed an Android tablet a couple months ago, because I didn't want to miss the tablet side of the Android. (There are not many tablet exclusive apps, but I'm way too obsessive to miss them.) But unfortunately I couldn't spare too much money and ended up with a 8 GB Nexus 7.<p>I wanted it to replace all my laptop needs -I haven't had a laptop for many years, after my last one died and got a desktop which I still love- but without a hardware keyboard and a big enough display, it's only great for reading anywhere. (Which I also don't, I'm too busy most of the time, and at the other times plain lazy.)<p>I hope Android ecosystem will mature even more in the near future. Look, Ubuntu is installable on the Nexus 7 right now. (I haven't done this yet, you can see the pattern here.) That basically means almost everything you can do on Linux, you can do it on your tablet too. And if you can support it with something with more horse-power than Raspberry Pi, you can call it a thin client/fat server pair.<p>The only thing left is to have a good tablet that can run Linux, has a big enough display, and has keyboard accesories. I personally don't like Microsoft, but the new line of Surface tablets look promising. As long as it lets me run whatever OS I want to, I'm all for it. Asus Transformer is not a bad option, but having the keyboard double as the cover and keeping it light sounds so much awesome.",1352725284

We use λ in our Common Lisp code instead of typing <i>lambda</i>. Actually, our λ is a macro that does a couple of things besides expanding into <i>lambda</i>; if it were just the latter we probably wouldn't have gone there. Once we did, though, I was surprised at the improvement in readability.",1247101064
694985,comment,694117,694464,0,0,moe,,,"Sorry, but I wonder what you're talking about. Package managers are designed exactly for this purpose.<p>It's not even hard to leverage the power of apt (the most advanced of the bunch) for your own deployments.<p>In essence you setup a local mirror and add that to the sources.list of all your hosts. Then you learn how to roll your own debs and push them to the mirror. The actual deployment happens via apt-get - which can be triggered by cron, a shell-script, puppet, a sweaty admin at 4am, or whatever fits your bill.<p>Working with the system this way instead of along with it (or even against it) has various advantages. Most importantly you get proper dependency management. Need to roll back to app version 2 from version 3, whereas version 2 depends on an older version of <i>foo</i>?  No-brainer, apt takes care of that for you, both ways, also in much more complicated cases. Need a package or package version that's not in the official repos?  No problem, roll your own and make your application package depend on that.<p>With a bit of elbow grease you can also have it mangle your database and other auxiliary infrastructure appropiately, within the respective pre-/post-install scripts.<p>Fabric and capistrano are just expressions of the old ""if you don't understand you're doomed to reinvent, poorly"" meme.",1247101059

It's also pretty clueless in general.<p>Stuff like:<p>> But the focus on subprimes ignores the widely available industry facts (reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association) that 51% of all foreclosed homes had prime loans<p>Yeah, that's because only a small % of all mortgages are subprime! But a <i>huge</i> percentage of subprime mortgages have defaulted, much higher than prime mortgages (as you'd expect).<p>> The analysis indicates that, by far, the most important factor related to foreclosures is the extent to which the homeowner now has or ever had positive equity in a home.<p>You mean the most ""correlated"" factor. This doesn't imply causation. But of course, if you have to ask <i>which</i> borrowers are most likely to just walk away, it's the ones with <i>nothing</i> more to lose!<p>Such a sad, pointless article.

The browser hosts remote apps and provides a runtime environment, which to the non computer science trained out there might appear to be an operating system, but its still not.

I loved the idea of, what I thought was, outsmarting the programmers of the game and bending their game to my will. So, instead of caring about football or going to the mall or movies, I enjoyed staring at assembly language and debug output from Diablo and Starcraft all night long. I loved coding in C++ and ASM. These are things that I don't think I'd even attempt to devote time to now days, sadly. This code is a huge blast to the past for me and I figured I'd upload it to Github for you guys to check out ... if only for some good laughs.

But from the perspective of a photographer, Im troubled. To start with, a large portion of the photography process has been removed  and not simply a technical part, but a creative part. Theres a reason focus is called focus and not something like optical optimum or sharpness. Focus is about making a decision as a photographer about what youre taking a picture of. Its clear that Ng is not of the same opinion. He describes focus as a chore. The Lytro solution simplifies photography the way hot dogs simplify meat. Without focus, its just the record of a bunch of photons. And saying its a revolution in photography is like saying dioramas are a revolution in sculpture.</i><p>The jury's still out on questions of whether digital is going to kill film or whether photography is going to kill painting, so I think you can safely ignore his doubts. His technical misgivings, which are so obvious as to seem trite. I do a lot of creative photography, but other times I just want a grab a good  picture in a hurry and I'm happy to let the autofocus do the work. News photographers and videographers will find this a godsend because there are many situations where they need to shoot under difficult conditions with limited time, and maintaining perfect focus can be extremely difficult. If they get it wrong, the resulting images may be commercially worthless, and editors are then faced with a choice of an inferior substitute, an expensive reconstruction, or simply dropping that imagery from the print/tv/movie to the detriment of the story being told.<p>What this is guy is upset about is that he's spent years learning the tricks of proper focus and getting good at it, and now they're going to be available to anyone for a few hundred bucks, regardless of their photographic skills.",1311387187

At worst, it provides an easy way for jerks to goatse, Last Measure, etc. third parties using the webmaster's site.

In 1952, optometry professor Elwin Marg wrote of Bates, Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists. Marg concluded that the Bates method owed its popularity largely to flashes of clear vision experienced by many who followed it. Such occurrences have since been determined to most likely be a contact lens-like effect of moisture on the eye.</i>",1311387038

Maybe broken wasn't the right word, these are just general problems with the game<p>1. The endgame is too easy and boring.<p>2. Elbereth and #pray make it too easy to get out of tough spots<p>3. Most classes end up playing similarly after the midgame (either wizard or melee typically)<p>4. Wands of wishing, magic markers, and polypiling are too powerful<p>5. The game is nearly unbeatable without spoilers<p>6. Sokoban is boring after you've played through it a few times<p>7. There's a bunch of cheap tactics like pudding farming<p>8. It's too generic and boring to put together an ascension kit. There are very few trade-offs you need to make in choosing what armor and weapons to use<p>9. The religion aspect is too simplistic<p>10. Combat gets tedious in the endgame. Most of the time you're just plowing through monsters. This results in tons of ""battle spam"" with you getting several messages like ""You hit the minotaur!"" every turn, forcing you to not read them and possibly miss important information<p>11. The game requires several patches to be playable (menucolors, sortloot, hpmon, etc.)<p>12. The default options are pretty bad<p>13. Traveling and exploring can be boring<p>Wow, that was a lot longer than I thought it would be. But I only write so much because I care :) I had a lot of fun beating nethack and and it's one of my favorite games of all time.  I'm possibly prouder of beating nethack than of my MS degree :)",1311386405

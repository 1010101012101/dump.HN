Time will show if the fish bites, however.<p>What is really going on is a war fought by proxy on the iPhone. The combatants are Adobe wanting to commoditize all platforms for their flash apps and Apple, who wants to keep the control of their platform. Ruby, Lisp (any), Haskell, Python, and Lua are not participants in the war, yet they got hit by the nuclear fallout.<p>The interesting question is how much Apple needs to do to piss off developers - which they need in their eco-system. While other platforms lags somewhat behind the iPhone, there is no doubt that the scales can tip quickly. I may be wrong, but I think rather few programmers make their pay from iPhone revenue streams.",1270861174

I'm a university student and for one of my semester projects I decided to try out pure functional programming. I ended up failing that class because I didn't finish the project, and doing bad in others because I spent ridiculous amounts of time doing the impossible project.

Let's just hope they'll ensure a large enough sample before using this as a factor in search ranking.<p>In my experience the Webmaster Tools performance indicator is terribly inaccurate for small sample sizes (relatively unpopular sites).<p>For one site I have intimate details of, Googlebot visits roughly one page every three minutes. I have every indication (knowledge of what the site is doing, local and distributed load testing, analysis of server logs, etc.) that the site performs consistently and well, but the Site Performance chart on Google's Webmaster Tools is all over the place: anywhere from 0.4 seconds to load (99th percentile) (which is where it happens to be now and is probably slightly overestimating the site performance) to more than 9 seconds to load, oscillating pretty wildly.  I'm fairly confident this isn't accurate (unless GA, the only external component on the site, is itself to blame).<p>On other, more heavily trafficked sites the Web Performance chart seems much closer to reality--in line with our load test results and anecdotal experience, so whatever the issue is it seems to pan out when they take a large enough sample size.<p>Edit: I see in other comments here that Google is using end-user data from the Toolbar to track this. That's helpful information and may explain the variability I and apparently others have seen.  Again, this is a good reason to hope they'll only take this into account for large sample sizes.

When it comes back to bite you in the backside, it's funny to observe how you react.<p>Is Apple a totalitarian government with Steve Jobs as it's dictator that was made possible by a decade of Ruby-like fanboyism?

The anger and fear that you're witnessing has been building for years - since the launch of the App Store, maybe even back to the iPod with its proprietary connector and its proprietary software. For many people, their worst fears about the iPad platform have been confirmed by this TOS change. It might seem irrational, but as a loyal Mac user I'm genuinely worried about what little bombs might be in the TOS for OS 10.7.<p>The most influential and powerful man in technology has a vision that many of us find appalling. He is imposing that vision as we speak and is being very successful in doing so. After years of rational debate, many of us have come to a conclusion about Jobs's intentions for the computer industry - a conclusion I see as perfectly reasonable and rational.

True, but let's not forget: there were no ""you"" when iPhone was released, but there were the reasons why it was a success. That success brought users, and users made platform interesting for developers when SDK came out. Users are here to stay, and most of the devs too. Heck, iPhone OS 4 and iPad will bring them in droves. Then we have another opportunity opening up: development of HTML5 ads for iAd.<p>My (maybe incorrect) assumption is, that all this noise on HN is not really representative of the thinking among iPhone developers—I will even go as far as assume that the most vocal ones never did anything for iPhone and were not going to–and will have a little if any effect on general public and their opinion about iPhone/iPad and Apple.",1270858270

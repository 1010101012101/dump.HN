5585422,comment,5584962,5584962,10,0,tokenadult,,,"As usual in threads on topics like this, you can rely on HN participant carbocation's  comments for some thoughtful perspective on the original article.<p>As the submitted article notes, responding to the press releases by the study authors,<p>""This all raises more questions than it answers. This study was small. The headlines are grandiose. The way people pass moral judgements is not necessarily indicative of their level of existential anxiety.""<p>Indeed. This is an intriguing issue to study, and well worth some further studies by other investigators to see if the results will be replicated in other study populations, but the author of the submitted article was correct to have a headline with an open-ended question rather than a definitive statement about Tylenol. On my part, because I take different over-the-counter pain relief medications when I need any of those, I'm curious if this result would be replicated for aspirin or for ibuprofen. That the pain of stubbing a toe and the pain of rejection in love might have some of the same brain mechanisms is suggested by our use of the word ""pain"" for both phenomena. But that requires further study. (I'm sure there are many studies already on that issue, but I'm not deeply familiar with the research literature on that topic.) That pain (of either kind) might motivate action and thus dulling pain might reduce motivation for some actions is also plausible, and also has surely been investigated before, but perhaps there are still some very basic facts about that issue yet to be discovered. As so often happens after a new study is published, the most firm conclusion is ""further research is needed.""",1366563537

Known workarounds include inserting a single quote at the beginning of a field, but this single quote may remain in the field forever, polluting the data downstream from the import.<p>* The obvious approach of enclosing CSV text fields in quotes, and non-text fields without quotes, won't work -- too many Excel versions strip out all the quotes while importing, without considering the implication of their selective application.

Science requires a testable explanation, one that can be generalized and potentially falsified by independent laboratories. If the study had offered a possible, testable explanation, it would have crossed the threshold of science.<p>4. It's important to say that psychological studies are virtually never replicated. One reason is that the original studies tend to maker nebulous claims that are difficult to quantify (like this study does). Another is that psychological studies tend not to be accompanied by the original study data, to a greater extent than studies in scientific disciplines. A third reason is that psychological journals tend to reject replication papers, especially those that don't confirm the original study's findings.",1366562383

To do this, you have a magic camera that, when it takes a picture of a civilian, compares it to a picture of a known terrorist. If they're in fact the same person, it will flag security over. Let's say that it is indeed a magic camera and makes the correct decision 99.99% of the time, which is far better than the current state of the art[1].<p>Do you have any idea how much DHS or DoD would pay for such a magic camera?<p>But it won't be enough.<p>Consider a watch list of 100 terrorists that we're looking for in our airport. If our camera compares each civilian's picture to all 100 terrorists in succession, and if we model each comparison as a Bernoulli trial, then each civilian has a 0.9999^100 = 99.004% chance of getting through security unfazed, which means we flag innocent people as terrorists about 1% of the time.<p>This doesn't work in an airport setting. Assuming 5,000 people pass through your small airport per hour and you have a 14-hour day, that means your security people have to go through 0.01 * 5000 * 14 = 700 false alarms each day. That's about 1.2 false alarms per minute. Your security people will have to go through all their checks each time this happens. Before long, they're going to stop trusting your magic camera.<p>As you scale your watch list up, it gets worse. How well would it work for 1,000 people on the watch list? 10,000? Note that the current US watch list has 50,000 people on it.<p>Even if it were a perfect magic camera, it coudln't catch terrorists on their maiden crime who aren't on the watch list at all.<p>(Most of this post was adapted from: <a href=""http://vast.uccs.edu/~tboult/tmp/IJCB11-tutorial-boult.ppt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vast.uccs.edu/~tboult/tmp/IJCB11-tutorial-boult.ppt</a> , which is a really interesting presentation if you're interested in these sorts of things.)<p>1: <a href=""http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html</a>",1366562291

Newer versions of Excel have ""fixed"" this by adding a flag to the t-distribution functions that let you choose whether you wanted to use single tailed probability or two tailed probability.  But this flag has not appeared on the functions for the normal distribution and thus the functions for these two similar distributions are still inconsistent.<p>Another annoying issue was the autocorrelation in the random number generator (a very bad thing for a <i>random</i> number generator).  The main rand() function is now corrected but the problem lives on in the randbetween() function, which shows that these two related functions are using separate RNGs instead of them both tapping into a single good RNG.  It's very frustrating if you want to do any real work in Excel because you can't trust the built in functions.",1366561259

When I talk to psychiatrists, they invariably say the problem is with psychologists. But if human psychology were a science, this lame dodge would not exist, because both psychology and psychiatry would be united by a  single theoretical framework, like the one that unites cosmology and particle physics (i.e. the Standard Model).<p>Particle physicists attend cosmology conferences, and cosmologists attend particle physics conferences, for the reason that both fields have the same theoretical framework and because discoveries in either field affect the other. And because physics is a science.<p>Psychiatrists don't attend clinical psychology conferences, and clinical psychologists don't attend psychiatry conferences, for the reason that there is no theoretical framework that unites psychiatry and psychology, and that, in turn, is because psychology is not a science.<p>> (and a psychiatrist actually is a medical doctor)<p>Yes, but a psychiatrist's medical degree is in general medicine, not psychiatry. <i>There is no mental doctor</i>, there are only physical doctors. The existence of a medical degree program in advance of psychiatric training is just a way to confer an unearned status to psychiatry.<p>When you call a psychiatrist ""doctor"", you are acknowledging his medical training, not his psychiatric training.

For one thing I got the idea all at once and didnt have to fiddle with it; and I wrote it in white-heat and scarcely had to change a word. This sort of thing endears any story to any writer.\nThen, too, it has had the strangest effect on my readers. Frequently someone writes to ask me if I can write them the name of a story, which they think I may have written, and tell them where to find it. They dont remember the title but when they describe the story it is invariably The Last Question. This has reached the point where I recently received a long-distance phone call from a desperate man who began, Dr. Asimov, theres a story I think you wrote, whose title I cant remember at which point I interrupted to tell him it was The Last Question and when I described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after. I left him convinced I could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles.\nNo other story I have written has anything like this effect on my readersproducing at once an unshakeable memory of the plot and an unshakeable forgettery of the title and even author. I think it may be that the story fills them so frighteningly full, that they can retain none of the side-issues.",1366560660

Unfortunately, before that happens it's pretty hard to imagine that an app developer would be able or want to introduce their users to both 1) their app, and 2) that they need to pay for a separate service in addition. Sounds like it'd be complicated and confusing to users. Perhaps if alpha.app.net were to take off that would solve the problem, but since they're focusing on a platform and not the app, that doesn't seem as likely.",1366560014

On my current project, I keep telling my partner that we need to keep the cognitive load down, because eventually we will have to bring on other people. Being that it's written in C++ (please don't flame me; it's what we have to work with), I'd love to use things like template metaprogamming and multiple inheritance. Since we are already working in a domain that doesn't always follow common sense (RF/E&M), and we are also using some design patterns that take a little getting used to in C++, we've had to eschew a few features of the C++ language. It's probably for the best anyways.",1366560012

Some of the prominent features include:<p>* Web server that runs on Node.js<p>* MongoDB integration<p>* Custom build tools<p>* Package manager (supports installing JS packages for either client-side code, server-side code, or both).<p>* SignalR-style remote function execution (call functions on the server from the client, and vice versa)<p>* JS client-side database caching<p>* Data binding in Javascript templates using Handlebars (or something similar, I don&#x27;t remember exactly).<p>etc.",1419015438

8773802,comment,8772563,8772732,0,0,alanning,,,"> Meteor.js is basically Ruby on Rails for Node.js and MongoDB...<p>As a long-time user of Meteor in production I have to say this is just about the exact opposite of how I think of Meteor.  I&#x27;d encourage anyone interested to try out the simple tutorial [1] and glance over the principles behind meteor [2].<p>For my take on it, Meteor is great for &quot;real-time&quot; apps where user actions should be disseminated across a broad network quickly.  It has helpful things like built-in latency compensation which make the end-user experience much nicer and the &quot;database-on-the-client&quot; is just glorious.<p>The most beautiful part of Meteor is that these features are provided for developers without us needing to make sacrifices or in most cases even change our way of coding.  Latency compensation is purely controlled by whether a method is made available on both the client and server or just on the server.  The client-side DB is automatically kept in sync with the actual back-end DB via a familiar pub/sub mechanism.<p>To me, these features (and the many others not mentioned) make Meteor much different than simply a &quot;Ruby on Rails for Node.js&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.meteor.com/install"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.meteor.com/install</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/sevenprinciples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/sevenprinciples</a>",1419015349

If the rest of the world was closed source, releasing your program open source wouldn&#x27;t make much difference.<p>The difference is collectivization. When practiced widely, open source hardware means that you can find other designs that have tackled problems you&#x27;ve encountered. You can borrow one guys power block, find an audio block that meets your constraints, tack on a core complex from another project, and use a motor control from a fourth. You probably won&#x27;t have anything to contribute to any of these projects: you may face some challenges they face, but collaborating with them is way harder than with software. That&#x27;s ok. There&#x27;s still a growing of a collective body of knowledge that others can recycle, and grow atop of. Open source hardware still does what is important about open source software: it empowers individuals to explore realms they would never have gotten to meddle with before.<p>As a small company, you can find a lot better a base than what you might develop in house if others are practicing open source hardware.

Basically, because I left my sinuses all stuffed up, I created a nidus for infection -- ie the perfect environment for bacteria to breed -- so I had a cold for a week, and then I had a bacterial sinusitis for another 2 weeks and finally broke down to take antibiotics. I could have avoided the sinus infection (and the antibiotics to tamp it down) if I&#x27;d just taken a decongestant when I had the cold. And the side benefit is my cold would have felt less miserable, too.

And who is to hold doctors responsible when they dismiss patients who might have a real illness?<p>First, let&#x27;s acknowledge that many people complaining of Morgellons might actually be crazy: they might be suffering some kind of OCD.<p>With that out of the way, we should ask ourselves, what if some of the people suffering are suffering from some real, physical illness? That is, what if the illness is real and simply can&#x27;t be diagnosed? For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s say that Morgellons is actually a rare manifestation of the varicella zoster virus (in the USA, this is referred to as &quot;chicken pox&quot; though it has nothing to do with chickens). VZV can cause shingles, which leads to agonizing nerve pain, so, as a thought experiment, lets imagine that Morgellons represents the rare case when VZV manifests as itching instead of pain.<p>Let us further suppose that in 10 years research proves the that VZV explains Morgellons.<p>My concern, in this hypothetical scenario, is the lack of accountability that the doctors face (or rather, don&#x27;t face). They will never have to apologize to the people who they labeled as crazy. We invest doctors with great social powers, and in some situations doctors can act as agents of the state (for instance, in the USA, regarding a patients mental state, if a doctor says you represent an immediate threat to yourself or others, they can have you locked up for up to 72 hours, pending a psychiatric examination).<p>The laziest diagnosis is &quot;You are crazy.&quot; A doctor who can not find an answer for your problem can simply dismiss you as delusional. And yet, a diagnosis of delusions should only be made after a psychiatric examination, and then, if positive, treatment should begin for the delusions. We need to put in place policies that keep doctors from dismissing patients with a diagnosis of &quot;delusions&quot;. Right now, it is too easy for doctors to dismiss patients with that diagnosis. If the patient has not been through a psychiatric examination, then a diagnosis of &quot;delusions&quot; or &quot;obsessive compulsive disorder&quot; should be forbidden.",1419014697

Except on my phone; I use QWERTY there, because it&#x27;s a completely separate skill and the different layouts don&#x27;t make any difference when you&#x27;re typing one-fingered (Android&#x27;s Gesture typing). I actually just tried switching and typing a few sentences, and I keep defaulting to QWERTY gestures.<p>I can still type QWERTY if I need to, even though I have barely used it in the past 13 years or so, but it takes me a few minutes to adjust and get up to speed. This happens if I need to use someone else&#x27;s machine, which doesn&#x27;t happen a lot. They wonder why I&#x27;m suddenly typing like an orangutan. But it goes away after maybe 10 minutes, then I&#x27;m up to maybe 70% of my Dvorak speed which is good enough for most short-term purposes. It still feels awkward to type QWERTY, so I try not to do it for more than a couple minutes.<p>(Interestingly, most of the problem when switching comes from punctuation, the muscle memory for typing punctuation seems to be separate in the brain. I noticed this when I was first learning Dvorak. I&#x27;d type &#x27;v&#x27; instead of periods all the time, even when I was reasonably fluent with typing letters. Now the same thing happens in reverse, where I&#x27;ll type &#x27;e&#x27; or &#x27;w&#x27; instead of periods or commas if I&#x27;m typing QWERTY.)<p>Overall, the fact that I&#x27;m using a different keyboard layout isn&#x27;t something that I think about much.

These were the earliest products to be sold via mass media and to be &quot;branded&quot; using the name of the preparer. I.e. in a world where a consumer would simply go to &quot;Shoe Street&quot; to buy shoes, these early apothecaries pioneered the idea of using mass media to persuade consumers not to buy a generic gout cure, but instead to go specifically to, say, Mr. Merck&#x27;s shop to buy &quot;Merck&#x27;s gout elixir&quot; (I use that example because the Merck corporation actually does trace its origins to a late 17th century apothecary).",1419014357

Its quite conceivable that you don&#x27;t know you&#x27;ve sold the last one that you will be able to deliver until you try to sell the <i>next</i> one, go to pick and deliver it, and find its not in deliverable condition (e.g., because it got damaged in the process of getting it ready for delivery), even with an otherwise-accurate inventory. Its also possible that you are expecting deliveries within the delivery window for a given order priority (or that you have a JIT ordering process and that your ordering time from <i>your</i> supplier has a turnaround within the delivery window for your normal delivery priority), so that you actually aren&#x27;t concerned with <i>your</i> inventory, but your <i>suppliers</i> inventory.<p>Logistics is complicated. Having enough information to give low-inventory warnings for specific products, with specific counts for low-inventory items, is tractable for some retailers, but not others.<p>Additionally, the practice of doing so implies that there is little risk of supply running out for other products, so while it may motivate decisions on the products that have the warnings, a retailer being known to provide the warnings may have the opposite effect on sales of products that don&#x27;t have the warnings.

Collective human culture is fluid, and subject to evolutionary pressures. If the human species converges to fewer languages because it allows us to do whatever we do more effectively, great. Going against that is just not practical and a waste of time.<p>In France, the modern French language has been pushed onto the population a few hundred years ago, at the detriment of local dialects (&quot;patois&quot;). In the recent years, there have been government initiatives to force schools in certain regions to teach their former dialects. What&#x27;s the point? Those dialects are close to dead anyway, and take up valuable teaching times. Kids are already graduating high school barely able to write and read French properly- they have very little to benefit from by spending time learning such dialects. Sure, they are important to ~archive~ culturally and historically, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with funding a few scholars working on that, but that&#x27;s it.<p>What is important to preserve is the knowledge that allows one to learn a language. In other words, if German were to disappear, that&#x27;s fine, and we shouldn&#x27;t make any efforts at attempting to preserve it. What we should do, however, is document German as much as possible (its vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, idioms, native works, etc.) such that if one needs to learn German 100 years later, it&#x27;s possible to do so.<p>The basis for that is two-fold: practicality (if an ancient German text is discovered but no one speaks German daily anymore, at least scholars can still decipher it), and preservation of human culture (but in a way that doesn&#x27;t go against pragmatism, which the approach described by the author in the article is).<p>The same debate applies to other things, e.g. flora/fauna. Of course, when species are becoming close to extinct because of humans destroying environments, we should do something about it. But species go extinct all the time because that&#x27;s just how nature works, and how it worked much before we got here. In this light, what&#x27;s the sense of trying to preserve plants or animals artificially?",1419013033

I find the infrastructure evidence as interesting, if not more interesting than the similar code:<p>> Technical analysis of the data deletion malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed. For example, there were similarities in specific lines of code, encryption algorithms, data deletion methods, and compromised networks.<p>> The FBI also observed significant overlap between the infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea. For example, the FBI discovered that several Internet protocol (IP) addresses associated with known North Korean infrastructure communicated with IP addresses that were hardcoded into the data deletion malware used in this attack.<p>>Separately, the tools used in the SPE attack have similarities to a cyber attack in March of last year against South Korean banks and media outlets, which was carried out by North Korea.<p>This also does not mention that some of the code was compiled on a machine configured with Korean language settings. This doesn&#x27;t establish definitively that North Korea was behind this, but it is consistent with that conclusion.<p>There is also classified evidence. You may choose to ignore it, but I find the claim deserving of some (though not decisive) weight, and certainly worthy of mention.",1419012406

I&#x27;m having trouble reading through the densely packed source.<p>In addition to tromp&#x27;s minor nitpick, I have several major ones.<p>- the code is full of redundant parentheses.

LPaste has HLint installed so you have a linting pastebin available online. <a href=""http://lpaste.net/116871"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lpaste.net/116871</a><p>- A lot of the functions are written in a non-idiomatic way. &quot;m >>= return . f&quot; is &quot;fmap&quot;, &quot;(.)&quot; can combine functions much more readable than Lisp stacks of parentheses.<p>- ByteString.Char8 is usually a wrong choice, more on that here: <a href=""https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/fbut.md#bytestringchar8-is-bad"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/fbut.md#bytes...</a><p>- If you count to &quot;length x&quot; then often there&#x27;s a more elegant solution that avoids calculating the length altogether. For example &quot;splits xs = zip (inits xs) (tails xs)&quot;.<p>- Brevity is never better than readability.<p>- No top-level definitions should lack a type signature. GHC even has warnings for that (I think they start firing with -W).<p>- A function should do one thing and then be composed with other functions. &quot;lowerWords&quot; converts to words and then maps them all to lower case, for example. These are two completely different operations in one long line.<p>- In order of increasing generality: foldr union empty = unions = mconcat = fold<p>- Use pattern matching, avoid &quot;(!!)&quot;. transposes w = [ a ++ [b0,b1] ++ bs | (a, b0:b1:bs) <- splits w] - also see <a href=""https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/fbut.md#head-tail-isjust-isnothing-fromjust-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/fbut.md#head-...</a><p>- For large amounts of words that you split and concatenate again, String is probably not the right type.

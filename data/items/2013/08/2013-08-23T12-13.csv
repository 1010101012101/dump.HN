Assuming the vehicles get a horrendous 10 miles/gallon (for a fuel cost of $0.35/mile), and the drivers are paid minimum wage (7.25 + employer costs = ~8.00), the cars would have to be driven 22.8 miles in a hour before fuel costs exceed labor costs.<p>Of course, the vehicles are probably getting twice the MPG, and the drivers are getting paid more, so the number of miles is probably much higher.",1377262762

No-one else is in possession of this information, and the article reads like a puff piece for GCHQ, particularly the ending.<p>This is incredibly misleading from the Independent - if it was from government sources that should have been clearly stated. If not they should name their source, it&#x27;s not The Guardian (info destroyed one month ago), Snowden (denied, seems unlikely), Greenwald (Brazil), or Poitras, so where did it come from if not the government? It&#x27;s really embarrassing for them if they have been duped, and even worse if they are complicit and reproducing press-releases from GCHQ without attribution, and with the implication that they have seen secret documents.<p>If they have seen secret documents and the UK government provided them, this undermines the argument against whistleblowers like Snowden, if not, who is the source?

Are you saying the banks tied the interest rtates on basic loans to companies purchases of other banking products? As a general rule, the financial crisis was caused by <loans that were too cheap>. Not by derivatives. The issue of derivitives is a more incidental role in the whole story. To use an analogy, something else caused the accident. Derivatives were like the airbag not deploying.  Still a problem, but not in the way you are implying.<p>It is also arguably the case that loans were too cheap because the banks were like a supermarket selling one product at a loss (debt) to get customers in the store (so called &quot;loss-leader&quot; product). And then they took advantage of the less educated consumers (ie, selling derivatives to people that should have known better).  This is of course, why glass-stegal was in fact originally law. To prevent ths type of bundling.<p>One thing this article fails to point out, though, is that the clinton administration got this model by copying it from the brits and europeans who long favoured the so-called &quot;universal banking&quot; model. so in that sense, its dis-ingenous to imply the usa was imposing or exporting this model via the WTO (it was the staus quo in Asia, too). For historical reasons, the continentals (eg, Germany), the Japaneese and others, never split off teh i-banks from the lending banks [1,2]. As a rsult, the CEOs of those combined banks were paid more than their US counterparts.  This whole fiasco was driven by the US ceo&#x27;s of the debt banks who were missing out on the windfalls accorded to the Investment Bank CEOs during internet 1.0 bubble. If you look at the history, the banks bought up the i-banks (as they had much larger balance sheets) and the CEO pay skyrocketed.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_bank"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_bank</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu</a>",1377262407

Jim Collins talked about these approaches in Good To Great, comparing Bank of America&#x27;s &#x27;weak general&#x27; promotion culture with Wells Fargo&#x27;s approach of getting the most talented people into the highest organizational positions possible.

Whether you use deposits, borrow from the money markets, or securitise loans, the money to make those loans has to come from somewhere.<p>Ultimately it was mortgage brokers and the retail banks (or retail arms of universal banks) that sanctioned these mortgages and lent money to highly unsuitable people. Yes they were securitised and sold on but as I say above this is just a funding mechanism. Yes the IBs have some responsibility for not checking the quality of the loans but then there&#x27;s an argument that should have been done already by the retail side. And of course no-one imagined that default rates would ever get as high as they did - which did wipe out some MBS and CDO tranches resulting in large losses for the holders. As an indication these types of issuance were typically stressed at default rates of 10% - and that was considered extremely conservative.

Is it gaining any traction?  One way I try to find out is by seeing if a lot of people are asking questions on StackOverFlow.<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/tags/dart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/tags/dart</a> -- 1386 questions so no traction.<p>A few others:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/tags/go"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/tags/go</a> - 2697.  Not so good.<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node.js</a> - 27, 301 \n  Someone&#x27;s probably asked all the basic questions.<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scala"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scala</a> - 17,933 A little light?<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/clojure</a> - 5709 - Really light!<p>If only a few people ask questions a day, and you get stuck jumping in head first, you might regret that later if you&#x27;re trying to move fast.<p>Real world example, ...the guys at Twitter went with RoR and ran into scaling problems.  Might be different today because RoR has matured?<p>I wonder if the guys at FourSquare have some growing pains with Scala?  If only the build would compile twice as fast...",1377259294

By putting measures in place to bar those with industry experience from working at the regulators you are decreasing the information available to the regulators.<p>The decrease in information directly decreases the regulators negotiating power, leading to greater regulatory capture.<p>Would this be more than regulatory capture caused by the revolving door? I don&#x27;t know - but it does swing both ways.",1377259243

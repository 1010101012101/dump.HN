267443,comment,267281,267434,0,0,spxdcz,,,"I think I was looking through a flickr group of 'great web design' or something similar (e.g. <a href=""http://flickr.com/groups/webdesign-inspiration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/groups/webdesign-inspiration/</a>) and found their site mentioned on it. We got in touch, and it went from there.<p>We found it a pleasure to work with them. I should point out that it wasn't a case of cost - there wasn't <i>that</i> much difference between them and companies based in the UK/US - the choice was purely down to their creativity.<p>We communicated throughout the project via Basecamp, and found they very quickly got 'what we meant' when we asked for changes or things to be done in certain ways. We've worked with tens of design agencies over the last 10 years (mostly face-to-face), and turbomilk were probably one of the easiest we've worked with!  It helps that they seem to be nice guys too, who genuinely love design. I think you get a sense of that from their website.",1217944602

267420,comment,265937,266278,0,0,babul,,,"Being 25-30 I have yet to see this trend :( and don’t see many of the people I know with partners more than ±4yrs their age.<p>Moving may solve the problems related to geography, but perhaps not those of culture and lifestyle which often form a larger part of the problem people face. As addressed by others, going to another country may not help any more than simply going to a larger more cosmopolitan city. But even in big cities (London, Paris, New York etc.) it is still possible to be single/lonely, as many are. I think only big changes in lifestyle really solve much of the dilemma such people face.<p>Lastly, as we get older, we all start to look at people more as future partners even from the outset. This becomes harder as, using nature as an example, it is probably fair to say that the most desirable mates are taken early. Hence those that leave things until later e.g. to focus on career etc., often find things harder and (I dare say) have to settle for less or compromise more. This seems especially true for women who feel their biological clock is ticking and develop the nesting instincts. I suspect this is one of the reasons that in a generally declining/competitive online dating market the sites focused towards marriage in the niches e.g. Jewish/Muslim/Christian matrimonial sites, do well compared to the rest.<p>Anyway, I am building a dating site to address some of the problems I see and welcome comments/suggestions/ideas of others (your experiences, what you see is broken, solutions). You can contact me at babulmiah{.a.t.]yahoo<,d,o,t,)com. Hopefully, I’ll launch an alpha for HN review soon.",1217942365

But it's not clear how a grandmaster finds the right move, especially considering simultaneous games where a GM plays on 20 or 30 boards at once against club players, often winning all of the games while only spending a few seconds, if that, on each move.",1217941833

267411,comment,267292,267292,0,0,dominik,,,"Pretty amazing to get $15m for a site not even out of beta...<p>I don't see the point of Rupture.  A social network for gamers, linking their real life identities to their game identities and keeping all their friends up to do date on their latest achievements in game?  (I'm not sure whether most gamers want to link their RL identities closely to their game identities; imagine applying for a job and having a Rupture profile come up in the top 10 google hits on your name...)<p>It seems vulnerable to being muscled out by improved networking within games; witness the example of Rupture itself, where its first beta implemented extensive integration with Blizzard's World of Warcraft, including creating profiles of players' equipment.  Then Blizzard launched its own Armory, forcing Rupture to reconsider, leading to the design we see today, where Rupture serves as a ""gaming aggregator and friend network,"" collecting Xbox Live feeds and Armory profiles, keeping track of changes, and alerting your friends.<p>All that said, congratulations to Mr. Fanning on the sale.",1217941614

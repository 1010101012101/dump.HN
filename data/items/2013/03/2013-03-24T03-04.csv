If you're a VC firm and you screw someone over, word will get around and all the good deals will dry up.

If you're able to estimate how many people actually read the comment that got 50 upvotes  then you'll know if it's truly interesting, but too long to read  only 50 people have read it.

Whether or not you teach kids CS at school is a minor point in the scale of things especially since you can always teach them extra stuff after school.<p>Responsible parents will make sure that their kids get a decent education by selecting a good school or by homeschooling.<p>The problem is, if a parent decides ""I don't want my kid to bother learning math"" then you completely close off a huge number of potential high-earning careers to the child.<p>Or worse, parents who are apathetic towards education and who's kids are unlikely to learn much of anything.<p>In other words, I would disagree that parents are <i>necessarily</i> better at selecting an education for their children.<p>This is especially important because education is important to social mobility.

They often simply added heat to the discussion, usually with language almost guaranteed to inflame. On HN, a lot of those comments would have been flagged. That doesn't mean they would have been deleted, of course, but they most certainly would have been flagged. I also wonder how the friends/foes system affects moderation.

5431022,comment,5429163,5430989,4,0,_delirium,,,"On the first point, yes, this is a frequent misunderstanding of the law. The management of a company has a general fiduciary duty to shareholders, but does <i>not</i> have any kind of narrow legal obligation to maximize profits, certainly not over any specific timeframe. They have quite large leeway to make decisions on the basis of whatever strategy they think is correct, and they may value things such as ""customer loyalty"" and ""brand perceptions"" in whatever way they see fit. If Google's management decided, for example, that it was important for their reputation that they stand behind their products long-term, and therefore that nothing would be shut down except in extraordinary circumstances, there'd be no legal problem with adopting that policy, even if it lost money short/medium-term. That's simply a strategic decision, which might be wise or unwise, but which courts have no authority to second-guess.

Communicator, connector, storyteller, passionate.<p>He gave a very good presentation on Amazon Web Services. Not just technical content but enough marketing content to make you feel like AWS was something worth investing your technical learning time in. If someone had a question about S3/EC2 that he could answer, he answered it to the best of his ability. More importantly, if someone had a question he could not answer, he stated that he did not know the answer and he knew someone on the larger AWS team that he could (and would) get the person in contact with (if they gave them their business card after the meeting).<p>In his talk, Jeff threw in some entertaining anecdotal/behind the scenes stories about AWS. For example, Smugmug (at the time) was charging all of its AWS fees on a Corporate Amex card.

For example, you are seeing me as wanting everyone to learn CS. This isn't the case at all, I simply want a system where those that want to have their children taught CS can easily do so, which is the opposite of the system we have today. The problem is that the ""strong consideration"" of the individual parent is largely inconsequential because the decision making process has been largely collectivized.<p>I can agree that if we are going to force <i>other people's</i> children to learn certain things then it might merit some big conversation but that's not what I want. Ironically, I think this very process has perpetuated the dilemma you fear: it encourages and perpetuates a culture of not worrying about your child's education and ""leaving it up to the experts"".<p>Secondly, having every parent teach their kid is not the only alternative to the public school system we have today. There are a spectrum of possibilities, from simply having less state/federal standards (I don't really care what Senator X from state that I have no representation in thinks about our education), to private schools.

The lab budget isn't taken into account, and no one actually checks to make sure the project hasn't already been funded (see <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/science/study-suggests-duplicate-financing-of-projects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/science/study-suggests-dup...</a>).

Last but not least, it brings down comments that are at all controversial; whereas an opinion with 1000 upvotes and 500 downvotes is probably more interesting to read than one that only gathered 50 upvotes within the same interval.

Teachers generally do become more effective with a few years of teaching experience, but we also find evidence that teachers may become less effective with experience, particularly later in their careers.</i>",1364094293

It was a service that existed, and other feed readers used it. Feedly has plans to provide a similar API, and it will likely be available to many feed readers because most of the work is done in creating it, not reading from it. They aren't trying to crush the market through a non-standardized service, they're just fulfilling a need.<p>Besides, Reader API support itself is still just a feature. You would need something like interleaving non-standard entities into RSS feeds for an equivalent to ""extend"". <i>That</i> is the kind of thing that the phrase refers to, as it fundamentally breaks what is supposed to be a standard that all parties can code against. RSS has continued to work fine.<p>If what you were saying were true, then, for instance, browser add-ons would be anti-web. Differentials in javascript engine performance would be anti-web. Different locations for the forward and back buttons would be anti-web.<p>The closest analog in the browser would be browser sync. It's already becoming a feature that users look for, as it is quite convenient to have your browser history and bookmarks on your phone and computer synced. Soon it will likely be essentially required for a browser to have a sync system if they want to survive in the browser market. So far all of the browsers sync systems are non-interoperable. Are they all using this feature as an effort to extend the standards of the web in a way that disadvantages the other browsers in the hopes of stomping out the competition?<p>No, and in fact, browser UI behavior is explicitly not standardized to allow that kind of differentiation. The important part is that they can consume and display the web correctly, so that it remains available to all, which leaves them plenty of room to compete on features.",1364094112

To get around this, you can use the []byte type, as you said, but Go is built with the assumption that all text is UTF-8. Frankly, I find the suggestion that ASCII is good enough, even for Americans, absurd.<p>Second, Python's ""list"" type and Go's slice type (what you're calling a ""true array"") are almost the same under the hood. Both are variable length arrays. (I'm not sure why Python calls it a ""list"" since it's not a linked list.) The only major difference is that Python's lists are always filled with pointers to the underlying objects. In Go, you have the choice of whether you want to use pointers to the underlying objects or to put the objects into a contiguous block of memory.<p>Speaking more broadly, there's no reason you couldn't use a lot of different Go practices in Python and end up with much more efficient Python code: pre-allocating lists of the proper size, for example, or making sure to use mutable buffers instead of immutable str objects. However, Go makes it natural to be concerned with these efficiencies, and Python makes it natural to ignore them. Each language has its strengths.",1364094004

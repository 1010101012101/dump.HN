Math, specifically linear algebra, is the language that lets you move from our 2/3 dimensional thinking to a more abstract high-dimensional space: the one machine learning lives in. It's easy to draw a bunch of points on a piece of paper and then draw a line between it and say ""this is linear regression!"" It's much harder to argue why regularization is important and why/how you would want to use/tweak it. The math is essential to getting important aspects of machine learning like this.",1344185794

You could be off making six figures but you decided to swing for the fences with your startup. That takes guts.

I know ""lifestyle businesses"" are perennially unpopular in parts of SV, but part of the whole <i>point</i> of being your own boss is that you really can choose to, say, spend 10% of your workweek attending meetups, <i>even if</i> it doesn't produce a monetary ROI, and you don't have to justify it to your employer. One thing I do agree with in that regard is that it's worth making sure you aren't doing things just because they feel productive, but really aren't, which endless meetings can sometimes fall into.

Maybe just killing the individual process or running a GC pass on every process and trying again might be a better approach than hosing the whole runtime, maybe they've fixed it.

If you switch to a low carb diet you really feel it for a day or two.  But then your glucose levels start to stabilize, and you don't feel the peaks and crashes anymore.  You also don't tend to have sudden, intense hunger nearly as often, so it's easier to not eat between meals and to feel satisfied sooner when you do eat.<p>I've never tried fasting, but I've been on a paleo-esque diet for a couple of years now, and I rarely get hunger pangs or feel that ""low blood sugar"" feeling.<p>The fasting idea is interesting, I'll probably experiment with it.",1344185251

I'm saying that the allegations that Samsung has purposely copying Apple designs in <i>some</i> of its phones and tablets is obvious. Samsung makes a lot of touch screen phones. Most of those phones, like most touch screen phones  made by anyone look very similar to each other. They're all pretty much the same basic design.

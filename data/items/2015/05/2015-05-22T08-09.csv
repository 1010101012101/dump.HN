9587199,comment,9584099,9584099,0,0,Matthias247,,,"Just wanted to comment on the &quot;Blocking vs. Non-Blocking&quot; nature of the different actor implementions. The article here says<p><i>A reason for choosing the asynchronous, callback-based approach has been that blocking plain OS threads entails significant overhead (as does the mere existence of many threads), which can be avoided with a non-blocking API. However, because Quasar – just like Erlang and Go – has true lightweight threads, blocking carries virtually no overhead</i><p>In my opinion the difference is much then whether an OS thread is blocked or not. Being able to make synchronous-looking (but not-thread-blocking) calls inside Actors still will block the Actor for other incoming messages for that amount of time. So you have states were the Actor is unresponsive - and with the right amount of dependencies between Actors you can deadlock.<p>A Actor which doesn&#x27;t use any blocking calls internally will be more responsive and less prone to deadlock. But of course - you have to model more states explicetly. E.g. if I have an Actor routine that&#x27;s like<p><pre><code>  while true {
    var msg = await mailbox.Get();
    if (msg is XYZ) {
      var result = await doSthAsync()
      updateState(result)
    }
  }
</code></pre>
and would like to transform that into a completly nonblocking implementation then I would need to model an extra state and probably handle messages differently in the timeframe between doSthAsync() was sent and the result is received.<p>This can be a good thing (you can be more responsive and all states are explicit) and also a bad thing  (more verbose code).<p>Important is also that with the blocked Actor one get some kind of backpressure strategy for free. Whereas with the nonblocked Actor one has to handle that also explicitly.<p>I tried both concepts in my recent work, the blocked actor mainly with F#&#x27;s mailbox processor and the nonblocked with my own implementation and personally favor the second version now. I find it quite useful to think about and model Actors as state machines and beeing able to handle all kinds of state transitions explicitly. It also made deadlock prevention easier.<p>Nevertheless I&#x27;m seriously impressed about the capabilities of Quasar and Pulsar.",1432285110

The proposed ZooKeeper solution will likely work fine in the simple case, if used with care and attention.  It gives me the willies a bit (because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to force users to separate locking from the DB level), but as long as the use case is restricted to compare + set on a single document, there&#x27;s little reason to think that there&#x27;s much wrong with it.  Apologies if I come across as belligerent.<p>-----<p>> Don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d need locking. Node A receives a request to buy an item, A asks nodes B, C, and D to confirm that the item is in stock in each node&#x27;s internal state. If all give the OK, A lets the purchase go through. If node B goes down, then A just asks C and D. I don&#x27;t see the need for locking or a master/slave.<p>Presumably in order to ensure that B, C, and D can consistently check the object&#x27;s state, nothing else can be allowed to write to it at that time - A effectively has to lock the object using zookeeper.  You then have to make sure that the object gets unlocked if A goes down after locking it, or most particularly if A hangs, keeping the zookeeper session open?  Otherwise your other app servers could get caught in a very long or infinite lock wait.<p>You&#x27;ve also got to keep track of the rest of your code, and make sure it never alters these same objects without locking.  I&#x27;m assuming here that you only distributed-lock objects when you absolutely have to, in order to improve performance: otherwise you&#x27;re going to start hitting some of the issues that make it hard to cluster relational DBs with decent performance (modulo some coarser lock granularity for a document-based system).<p>As you add complexity to this approach (say, perhaps you need to work on two objects at once), you also start having to think about other problems like deadlocking, or what happens if your zookeeper session fails part way through your work, where you&#x27;ve made half of the changes you want to make, and you can&#x27;t easily roll back.  This is all fine if you have programmers who are competent to think about these kinds of problems, but they&#x27;re typically pretty expensive - and my experience is that most people just don&#x27;t really bother to think about it.<p>> You have a single point of failure with a single, monolithic server. If its hd dies, you will be in serious trouble restoring terabytes of db.<p>Any system of value will of course have a replica, meaning you&#x27;re perhaps more likely to be worried about network problems than the server falling over.  Of course this is still less reliable than a perfectly implemented multi-master distributed system, but it&#x27;s also hugely easier to use correctly - and the likelihood of failure of a single node is actually very low.  Obviously if you literally cannot afford any downtime, maybe you go with a distributed system (or follow the banks and use mainframes..), but businesses that will be killed by network blips are certainly in the minority.",1432283303

That doesn&#x27;t really fix the problem, it just moves it around and it&#x27;s usually done because they don&#x27;t know how to reason about the underlying problem and fix it properly.<p>You need to sleep long enough that whatever you&#x27;re waiting for will definitely have finished. Most of the time you have no exact guarantee of that, so you have to pick some N that is relatively large. Inevitably, no matter what N you pick, sooner or later, the thing you&#x27;re waiting for will take N + 1 and things break. To make it worse, the N + 1 situation often happens because you&#x27;re getting an unusually large amount of traffic or because something else in the system is already in a failure state. So the breakage tends to come at the worst possible time and exacerbate things.<p>Meanwhile, if you sleep for N ms somewhere, one thing you can guarantee is that whatever you&#x27;re doing will take at least N ms. There&#x27;s no way to make it faster, even if it may have been unnecessary to wait that long. Often not a big deal, but the more developers sprinkle sleeps into their code, the more often you run into bizarre performance bottlenecks as a result.<p>Network timeouts and similar are kind of a fact of life, so there&#x27;s no perfect solution.

Back then we had 32-bit address spaces, and that was the main limiting factor for threads (because you&#x27;d often allocate 2MB of address space for each stack). And we didn&#x27;t have multi-core processors.<p>These days you could actually reasonably have 10k threads. In theory switching between threads shouldn&#x27;t be much different performance-wise than switching between callbacks in an event loop (either way you take some cache misses), and the thread stack is probably more cache-friendly than scattering objects all over the heap (and certainly easier to use).<p>But now you have the problem that synchronization between threads (whether mutex locking or by lock-free algorithms) is complicated and surprisingly slow, specifically because you have to worry about all the ways simultaneous memory access might confuse the CPU or its caches. Whereas with single-threaded async each callback is effectively a transaction, without requiring any slow synchronization.<p>Of course if you&#x27;re doing single-threaded async then you probably aren&#x27;t fully utilizing even one core. You see, even if you <i>think</i> you are doing everything in a non-blocking way, that&#x27;s not really the case all the way down the stack. If you try to access memory that is paged out, guess what? You are now blocked on disk I/O. And because you aren&#x27;t using threads, the OS can&#x27;t schedule any other work while you wait. And even if you&#x27;re pretty sure you never touch memory that is paged out, you surely <i>do</i> sometimes touch memory that is not in the CPU cache, which also takes a while. If your CPU supports hyper-threading, it could be executing another thread in the meantime... but you don&#x27;t have any other threads.<p>And then multicore. The previous paragraph was a lot more interesting before multicore, but now it&#x27;s just obvious that you can&#x27;t utilize your CPU with a single thread.<p>The heavy-duty high-scalability servers out there (like nginx and I&#x27;d guess HA Proxy) actually use <i>both</i> threads <i>and</i> async, but while this gets the best of both words, it also gets the worst: complicated synchronization <i>and</i> callback hell.<p>Basically, all concurrency models suck.<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/+KentonVarda/posts/D95XKtB5DhK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/+KentonVarda/posts/D95XKtB5DhK</a>",1432282865

It just maps much better to vectors than to pixels, but there are limits, of course. Heatmaps often are better drawn via canvas, especially those where there are no discrete shapes but rather blurry blobs of colour.<p>Performance is a difficult topic and hard to compare, beyond simple things: In canvas (mostly) your only option of optimisation is to draw less, i.e. touch fewer pixels; with SVG being rendered and composited by the browser it often boils down to »don&#x27;t move elements that don&#x27;t have to move« to enable the browser to render less and not throw away every partially composited texture. In IE and Chrome SVG has quite great performance, in Firefox you have to be careful what you do.

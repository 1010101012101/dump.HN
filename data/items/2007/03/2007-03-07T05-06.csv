2671,comment,2666,2666,0,0,python_kiss,,,"""But, as Paul notes, the easiest way to make something that people want is to make something that you want. Yahoo! started out as a directory of Jerry and Dave's favorite links. Movable Type was born out of Mena's need for a better way to talk about herself. Jonathan started Friendster to find a girlfriend. Zuckerberg started FaceBook to find a girlfriend. Joe and Alon started JDate to find Jewish girlfriends. Ted started Dogster to find his dog a date. If you build something you want, chances are pretty good that someone else will want it as well.""<p>Well said! :)",1173247197
2670,comment,2651,2652,0,0,Alex3917,,,"There isn't a lot of good theory behind visualizations, so I have been working on creating my own. My thinking, as pertains to this, is that visualizations fall into two categories:<p>1) Visualizations where the goal is to help the user understand things that are too complicated to grok from raw data. Examples include histograms, line graphs, pie charts, etc.<p>2) Visualizations where the goal is to help the user actually create more complex thoughts than would otherwise be possible. Examples include mind maps, concept maps, flow charts, etc.<p>The goal of a visual interface, as opposed to a visualization, is to reduce the cognitive load required to use the software.<p>I think a lot of reason why we see such garbage is because many people are choosing a visualization from the wrong category to solve their given problem.",1173247033
2669,comment,2608,2608,0,0,notabel,,,"Unfortunately, the author largely glosses over what I consider the most difficult part of search--extracting semantic information from unstructured source materials (also refered to as ""magicks""). However, the discussion of bandwidth and server allocation - of starting with what you can afford, and spending your effort/money on what matters (i.e. your algorithms) resonates with a lot of the ideas behind YC.  When it comes right down to it, anyone who can sweet-talk a VC can get fat pipes and big boxes--the (human) brains behind the (algorithmic) brains are what differentiate Google from Lycos.",1173246970
2668,comment,2666,2667,0,0,notabel,,,"Yes, actually, there is a word for that--sort of.  It is essentially a special case of confirmation bias.  Confirmation bias is a concept from cognitive psychology; basically, the human mind heuristically prefers data which support (confirm) its nascent inferences.  In this case, the inference being developed is roughly the importance/prevalence of the word.  <p>So, there isn't a word for this precise phenomenon (to my knowledge), but you're welcome to coin one.  If there's one thing cognitive psychology loves, it's terminology.  (Don't get me wrong, cognitive psych is delightful, but it loves its lingo.)<p>N.B. Related phenomena are the cocktail party effect, and, in the large, figure-ground phenomena, and selection bias. EDIT: And priming.  Thanks to python_kiss. (Wikipedia has decent articles on these things, but if you're really interested, go to the library and get a good psych book.)",1173246665

Creating an online personal ads search engine to find dates for similarly tagged pez dispensers from within their social network. <p>Seriously though, is there a word for noticing something everywhere you look right after learning about it?",1173245494

2663,comment,2618,2618,0,0,danielha,,,"""If I were the CEO of a Web company planning to expand worldwide, I'd hit these countries in this order.""<p>Seems like a poor data analyzing. China's population is vastly greater than the UK -- it should be no surprise that there is a higher number of users online. Does this mean that the UK's demographic is less valuable for a web company? I highly doubt it... unless your product is targeted in such a way.",1173244070
2662,comment,2602,2660,0,0,danielha,,,"There is more to reading than physical books.<p>There are MSWord documents, spreadsheets, PowerPoints, etc. These are documents that someone might want to simply embed in a blog post. A user might want to embed a PowerPoint presentation on their MySpace profile. Getting videos online was not an impossible task before YouTube. YouTube made it easier, as you mentioned, by enabling users to view without worry of player or codec. With Scribd's flash viewer, people are able to view through their browser regardless of document type.<p>I'm no fierce advocate of Scribd; in fact I'm not too familiar with them. I just know it's something that would make things easier for me personally. This is reason enough for me to be a believer.",1173243688

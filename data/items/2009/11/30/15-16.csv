It has evolved into something separate from mathematics - certainly related, but also clearly independent.<p>I've said this before on HN, but there is more to computer science than the math-heavy, CS theory that many people here seem to think is the entirety of computer science. Computer science also encompasses the study of programming language design and implementation, computer architecture, operating systems, networking, graphics and other fields. While math is a part of these fields, math is also a part of organic chemistry.<p>Perhaps the most fundamental nugget of computer science is that it is everything concerned with computation in both the abstract and in implementation. All of the fields I mentioned stem from that idea, including CS theory.",1259596751

What you present in your comment could cause a slight warming but the reality is heat is still coming from the sun and if the atmosphere is already IR opaque than the heat trapped inside our atmosphere is limited by that meaning the Global catastrophe that is predicted doesn't really gel.

The scientific ideal is to approach every situation with reasoned skepticism, and then to use experiments to collect evidence that removes as much doubt as possible.<p>We have just discovered that we have less evidence, and more doubt, than we thought we did.  The proper response is to re-establish those results as quickly and conclusively as possible.  Lepidopterists do that much, even knowing that their papers will only be read by a handfull of colleagues.<p>Global warming is a historic issue and requires a historic response, but it seems there are some who want conclusive proof that their is a problem before they will publicly acknowledge that there might be a problem.  I can't imagine why.  But considering how virulent an argument about ""Science"" global warming has become, I think we would do well to remember that science is a method, not a set of conclusions.",1259594868

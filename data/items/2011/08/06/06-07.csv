They haven't produced a budget plan in nearly three years, while borrowing 40 cents of every dollar spent during that time.</i><p>Uh, you are merely parroting inaccurate GOP talking points, and I think we can be a little more accurate than that here.<p>First of all, the House and Senate easily passed Obama’s first budget on the president’s 100th day in office. That budget measure, however, did not include a single GOP vote, a harbinger of the lack of bipartisanship to come. From 2009 to January 2011, Republicans forced more than 90 “cloture” votes, which require 60 senators to agree to limit debate (ie stop a filibuster) on a measure.<p>Pretending that there was no Democrat ""budget plan"" for 2010 is disingenuous at best.

He said the letter codifies a GOP strategy of delaying action “on critical matters, then blaming the Democrats for not addressing the needs of the American people. Very cynical, but very obvious, very transparent.”<p>And imagine that, here we are in 2011....<p>Of course, filibuster has been used by both parties, but these tactics by Republicans accelerated drastically when Dems took over Congress late in Bush's presidency. As even the conservative American Enterprise Institute noted, Republican filibusters were used increasingly to obstruct legislation:<p><a href=""http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/01/the-rise-of-cloture-how-gop-filibuster-threats-have-changed-the-senate.php#more"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/01/the-rise-of-clotu...</a><p>""It is the most striking in history,"" American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Norm Ornstein told TPM.<p>""What happened, Ornstein says, is that during the last two years of President George W.

2853249,comment,2805474,2805474,1,0,standardminds,,,"software contractor here who occasionally hires other contractors:<p>IMO the key to contracting is breaking up everything into very small milestones and releasing payment on completion of the the milestone. Start with a very small part of a project and set aside a few hundred dollars. The milestone should be due in 2 - 5 days with some penalty or even no payment for being late. Pay immediately if possible and have the contract go to the next larger milestone for more money. It's best if the first milestone doesn't require wading though much old code. If the contractor can't complete the small milestone on time, they won't be able to do the bigger milestones. Let them know this ahead of time. If possible, only sign the contract for the first milestone. Break up a big opaque risk into a series of very small, closely monitored risks.<p>1. could be that your SW is too bad or complex but not enough info. One thing with references is that being a good contractor is very different than being a good programmer. Scheduling and client communication/management are actually\nthe hardest part of working as a contractor. It could be as simple as the contractor being talented but not working hard enough or procrastinating on the project.<p>2. If I had to guess he's probably not on vacation. He's probably working on another project with a client that either pays better or he has a longer/better relationship with. This happens all the time. As a contractor, there have been days where I've gotten 10 proposal for \ndoing work. If you're not careful with scheduling it's very easy to take on too much work. Again breaking things up into very small milestones with clear due dates can save this. Make sure you do your part and pay the contractor immediately.Your project will become the ""emergency"" \njob that he pushes others aside to complete since the path forward is clear and he knows he'll get the money right away. If it's on elance or odesk let them know you'll have to give them a bad review if they can't fix it. Don't give them a bad review on your personal blog as it will make good devs nervous about working with you. Clients who have had problems with contractors in the past are likely to have them in the future as well.<p>3.

The US has a history, stretching back well over a century, of launching military campaigns to support corporate interests.  Be it South America, the Middle East, or Asia, the US has invaded countries and toppled governments time and again in support of its economic goals.  Now, I think this is reprehensible, but I also wouldn't be so naive as to say that the path to economic recovery lies in an end to military adventurism.  The US is rich for the same reason Rome, England, and Spain were: they won their riches at the the end of a sword.<p>The American military budget is clearly unsustainable, but that doesn't mean an end to foreign wars is in their economic interest.  It's no coincidence that the US has been both the most prosperous nation on Earth, as well as the most aggressive, for nearly 200 years.<p>Take a look at the history of US military actions on Wikipedia [1], and see how many times the phrase ""protected American interests/property"" is mentioned.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_military_operations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_milit...</a>",1312611494

I'm just out of college and from central Massachusetts, a place that I can best describe as ""incredibly boring"" (but with pretty good public schools).<p>However, Silicon Valley doesn't appeal to me at all. San Francisco? Sure, that's appealing, but it's not really ""the Valley"" (correct me if I'm wrong here). Even if it is, it's still not as appealing as Boston/Cambridge or New York.<p>I've been to the (non-SF) Valley. To me, it seems like home, but a little denser and with more money. There's still a lot of sprawl. You have to drive most places (I have very little interest in owning a car currently - I don't have $20000 on hand and I'm not interested in debt). BART seems kind of, well, sad, compared to the MTA or MBTA. I guess there's the advantage of being able to easily bike year round, but I would still need to bike a lot further.<p>It's a <i>nice</i> place, I certainly won't debate that.

Understandably, it's important to get your sales team up to speed, and using various sales systems might help, but the team itself should really be the focus in which to discover the speed.  Mentoring, performance transparency, strategic incentives, and regular recognition of top performers will have more benefits that some 'off the shelf' system.  What I found most revealing was that when the sales team was flying blind without a marketing plan, no matter what system they were using (hello cold calls?) they were spinning their wheels.  Instead, building a comprehensive marketing / sales program resulted in better client outreach. This reinforces the basic fact that every product or service should have a marketing plan attached to it to lay the groundwork for the sales process that follows.  And that question is simply answered by asking 'Who wants it, and how will we best let them know about it?'. To that answer, I doubt - cold calls  'brrr' - will ever be a top choice. Otherwise, thanks for sharing your team members stories.<p>ps. here are the 2 starred reviews from the 'you can't teach a kid to ride a bike at a seminar' book (what kind of title is that anyways?  Surely you CAN teach a kid to ride a bike at a seminar.  How better to teach a kid?  By having them read a book?  Maybe it should be called 'you can't teach a kid to ride a bike by reading a book'.

We might be better off if we only let highly educated people vote and only after they passed a series of intelligence and psychological tests but we don't do that. As long as essential spending was covered I do think it would lead to a better allocation of federal dollars simply because it would add an additional check & balance to the system.<p>You could now (effectively) vote for a candidate or party <i>and</i> through your allocation of tax dollars keep them on a leash. It would allow for a more nuanced political system. For example I might vote for a deficit reducing Republican but I don't trust them to keep their hands off the EPA so I give environmental protection 50 points. Maybe I vote for a Democrat but I still think the deficit is really important so I put 50 points on deficit reduction. This would add a whole new dimension to politics and give some power back to the people. It would in my opinion make the commons relevant again. As it stands today I think many Americans are feeling like their vote is no longer all that important. You get two choices, you vote for one or the other, pat them on the back and cross your fingers. That's just not good enough. By controlling a few hundred billion dollars of the budget we might find ourselves on equal footing with PACS, lobbyists, media tycoons, etc.<p>Of course there are a lot of practical details I didn't address. It may be this could only cover domestic discretionary spending, or perhaps you could only allocate your tax points every 2 or 4 years to provide for more stability and of course for long-term deficit reduction it would have questionable value since the overall level of spending/revenue would still be playing a central role.",1312610627

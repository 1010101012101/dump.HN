You're putting the blinders on. ""This is where we're going because that's what we said!"" When you don't have a plan you can pick up on an opportunity that comes along. You're taking the blinders off. ""This is where we're going because it makes sense today."" I'd rather stroll into the future with my blinders off.<p>One of the best pieces of advice I've ever read from 37 signals.",1185561978

They have what I think would be a unique advantage... they automatically inherit the trusted & neutral ""brand"" thing associated with swiss banks. <p>It would need to prove stable but it might be enough to give Paypal or any other fund processor (online banks even?) a real run for their money.",1185560684
37137,comment,37085,37085,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Man, this'd be a legal nightmare if you ever needed to take funding or make important decisions.  (Disclaimer: IANAL, but I just met with one, and spent a lot of time and a good chunk of change dealing with having too many founders.)<p>Problem is, there are many decisions - like taking investment, or big partner deals, or top management changes - that require shareholder consent.  If you have lots of non-involved shareholders, you've gotta send out shareholder vote notices to all of them and hope they come back.  Without the signatures, you can't do anything.<p>Plus, if any of your shareholders have a conflict of interest (say, your product falls under their IP agreement), you potentially have a legal problem on your hands.<p>You can ameliorate this somewhat with a voting trust or various other legal arrangements that I know little about.  Check with a lawyer to make sure.  But it just sounds like a really bad idea to me. ",1185560620

37135,comment,37073,37124,0,0,stuki,,,"	That was my point exactly. I would think anyone setting up a wide ranging electronic payment system must need some sort of funding, banking deals etc. Being US based, getting that with a prominent link for Online Casinos etc. to sign up as merchants on the front page, seems rather unlikely. Hence, unless they refocus, the whole startup seems a bit unserious. I wish them the best of luck, though; hoping that does not make me guilty by association:).",1185559845

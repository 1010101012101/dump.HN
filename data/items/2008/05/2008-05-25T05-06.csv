199378,comment,198964,199255,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Like I mentioned in a parent comment, I wrote my comment after working on a web application. If you see my comment there, I mention that I'm not quite sure how I could possibly make the interface accessible in any meaningful way for a blind person. I could give them a text only version of the web app, maybe that had a more linear and modal interface. But it would be about as accessible as some XML formats are human readable. I mean technically they're human readable but can you read them? I know I can't! :-)<p>Simple informational websites have no excuses today for not being accessible. As you have shown, there are simply too many options for these sites for them to turn a blind eye to any one of them. But simple informational websites appear to be a dying breed. There are several streams of information being presented to users on most websites. Trying to force them all to be accessible seems to me about as ridiculous as mandating that CNN require their closed captioning feeds to have not only what the talking head is saying, but the news ticker, the stock quotes, etc. that are also thrown on the screen at the same time; oh and this closed captioning feed needs to be backward compatible with an analog 21 inch Sanyo TV :)<p>It frustrates me that HTML+CSS+Javascript web applications will be at an inherent disadvantage here unless we as an industry come up with some sort of convention. We could start with some notification event model, or even something as simple as saying that if your HTML markup sports an accessibility meta tag, that all DOM objects with the class name accessibility-hidden should be ignored by screen readers and that those with the class name accessibility-display should be picked up by the screen reader. The reading order of each element could even be specified by adding a class read-N to DOM elements where N >= 0 and denotes the priority of reading.<p>If we had something like this, at least I could hide parts of my user interface from a blind person (no pun intended!) and show them only the most important and relevant information to achieve the primary task at hand.",1211695079
199377,comment,199279,199279,0,0,bokonist,,,"My parents were the same way.  What's interesting about Paul's essay is that many of the examples of lies were things that the vast majority of people believed 40 years ago, but that many fewer believe today.  For example - the taboo against swearing used to be much stronger among adults, as was the taboo against pre-martial sex.  Most adults used to believe in God.<p>The cause of the lies is that a generation as a whole stops believing things their parents taught.  But when this generation has children, the only model for parenting is their own parents.  Thus they teach their kids like their parents did, and that includes ""lies"" that the adults no longer believe.  In other words, the ""lies"" adults teach kid represents an echo of once widely held beliefs among adults.",1211695075

You're arguing a straw man. Nobody is arguing that IPv4 addresses will be impossible to obtain; any such argument would be moronic. But if address allocation tracks application development rather than end user population, I could see that as a positive development.<p>I don't think you're following my point. When I sent an AIM message to a friend, IPv4 isn't routing it; AIM is. IPv4 is just a detail. This is the future. The overhead of app-layer routing is small --- tiny compared to the overhead of running rich client apps in Javascript over HTTP. If IPv4 matters in 10 years, that's a huge failure.<p>Which future would you rather put your energy into? The one where we can address realtime content to groups of people by name, or the one where we run basically the same apps we do now but with a bigger address space? Caring about IPv4 addresses is like caring about Ethernet addresses.",1211694828

199369,comment,198964,199275,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"When I'm making informational web sites, I typically work very hard to achieve a seamless degradation. I wrote my comment after working on a web app I'm developing. I sat there and tried to figure out how I could possibly make this thing accessible to a blind person and I don't think I can without creating an entirely different user interface just for them. The problem with my interface is I'm not just showing an information article that can read left-to-right top-to-bottom. It's more of a car dashboard.<p>As more and more applications hit the web, I don't think we'll be able to just say that HTML is the web. For better or for worse (there's a whole other argument for another day) we've entered a situation with web applications where there are several players: HTML+CSS+Javascript, Flash, Silverlight, etc. Unless somebody sits down and says ""Ok everybody we really need to get a grip on creating an accessibility convention for HTML+CSS+Javascript applications"" you're going to have the proprietary folks pushing accessibility as an advantage of their platform. And you know what? They'll be right.<p>Thanks for the link, I never heard of that website so I'll check it out. For what it's worth, I worked at a company that had some blind people test our sites when they were done nested tables and paid no attention to accessibility, and versions which (at least from a technical standpoint) implemented all the best practices. Frustratingly, they didn't seem to do much better. The content itself needed to be tailored to them because there was simply too much. Like you say, the web of today seems to be built for scanning large quantities of information. Just like you can't take an info-heavy website and throw it at a mobile device because people have different requirements and constraints when browsing from a mobile device, making a website accessible doesn't seem to be just an engineer problem but an editorial one too.",1211694079
199368,comment,198980,199076,0,0,neilc,,,"<i>Of course, more companies contribute back to Linux than contribute back to FreeBSD; they're obligated to.</i><p>I don't think it's as simple as that. The license has a major influence on the ecosystem around the project, and it is that ecosystem that determines the contributions that flow back to the open source code. The GPL encourages a certain type of ecosystem, and BSD another; that the GPL will automatically yield a healthier ecosystem than BSD is not at all obvious to me.<p>One of the major differences is that with the BSD license, companies are free to build proprietary products on top of the open source code, which opens up a lot of business models that aren't feasible with the GPL. Take Postgres, for example -- there are many companies that have used Postgres to build a proprietary database of some description. Some of these companies choose to contribute changes back, or to employ Postgres developers full-time, or to hire them as consultants -- mandating that all changes be contributed back would probably mean the companies wouldn't exist in the first place, or wouldn't be using Postgres, which would probably be a net loss for the project. And if a company chooses not to contribute code back? Well, personally that's fine with me, but I can understand why others might disagree.",1211693995
199367,comment,199080,199080,0,0,SirWart,,,"Compiling means changing something from one source language into another. The traditional meaning is compiling a high level language into machine code which is then assembled into opcodes. That's not the only way to do it though, Python is first compiled into a bytecode (a more compact representation of the source code checked for syntax errors) and that bytecode is interpreted.<p>Interpreters are easier to write because it is not as much work supporting different architectures compared to compiling the code. Also, interpreting small amounts of code that will only be run once is typically faster than compiling it and then optimizing and executing it.<p>Compiling however has much greater potential speedups. A compiler can make a decision at compile time once, and that decision never has to be made again. In an interpreted language that decision might have to be remade on every iteration of a loop.<p>As you move up from more powerful languages than C, the languages get harder and harder to compile because you know intrinsically less at compile time. In C for example, every variable is known at compile time, so every variable lookup can be translated into a read from some offset from the stack frame pointer, which is very fast. The C compiler will keep a hash table at compile time to keep track of these offsets, but at run time that information is no longer available. In Python, you don't know all the variables that are going to be looked up at compile time, so you have to do those expensive hash table lookups at run time.<p>In the end, naively generating code for a dynamic and reflective language won't yield that much of a speedup without some serious optimization passes, which was typically not very helpful because the higher level languages were used as glue code to high performance libraries or programs. As people become more interested in using these languages for more intensive work expect to see more effort at compiling then, although most will probably be compiled into a virtual machine bytecode and then compiled to native machine code by the JVM or CLR.",1211693981

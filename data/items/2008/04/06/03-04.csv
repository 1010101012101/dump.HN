So instead of just building upon the best aspect of the games, they do a lot to improve the worst. Guess that makes sense though given that games generally have a more restricted flow than apps.<p>9, Another good datapoint in the ongoing debate over ""release early to customers"" vs ""release high quality."" Then again, they do use somewhat of a hybrid as I'm sure they have testers before they do the full scale release. Or do they?<p>10, There are ""new"" types of games coming out of the console gaming industry? I'm hardly convinced...",1207453734

155991,comment,155534,155534,0,0,mronge,,,"I would say much of the processes are useful, but don't take any of them too far. Unit testing, continious integration, version control, regression testing, and building your software in iterations are all things that are important for building good software.<p>If it's just two people in a garage than some things aren't as necessary as others, but as you build a team you'll need all of these.<p>For a startup other things like UML diagrams, pair programming and etc aren't necessary.",1207453557
155990,comment,155601,155925,0,0,zkinion,,,"As in my response to the other guy above, ""isn't all that special"" really was referring to being able to compete as enterprise software against the set in distribution channel.<p>Yes, asterisk is great.  Its probably even better now than it was a few years ago.  Their mailing lists were AWESOME, and just like Linux, if I was resourceful enough, I could figure out what I needed to and if I couldn't, help was just an email away.  That doesn't mean that most businesses won't just call Avaya and pull out their check book.  Enterprise level software has a way of being completely bogus.  Go into any medium to large (and all too often, sadly, even small) companies, and look at the garbage they use, then look how much they pay for that garbage.  Then look at how they actually believe in that garbage as being the right choice.<p>Asterisk could certainly improve its lot in the future by changing its ease of use, and making more of an effort at being in the distribution channel.",1207453502

155987,comment,155608,155744,0,0,aswanson,,,"My point was more along the reactive lines to a price increase of energy.  Regardless of the positive environmental result, which I applaud, if middle America sees it's utility bill increase by a significant percentage, whoever has their name attached to the legislation that caused it is at serious risk of being voted out.<p>Note also that an increase in the price of energy causes prices across the board for every manufactured item to increase.  Classic inflation, 1970s style.  This is not the best economic environment to cause inflation in.",1207452846

155985,comment,155830,155955,0,0,icey,,,"A quick disclaimer: I'm really a Lisp / Scheme noob, but I'm learning them both for academic purposes.<p>That being said, at first the parens bugged me a little bit, but as I got to developing more applications, the more I really grew to LOVE the parens. To me, they introduce a certain purity to the programs that I write; it's like every s-expr is a single thought and every function is a train of thinking. Beyond that, an additional benefit that I've found is that I can hold MUCH more of a program in my head when they're organized this way. I think it has to do with the chunking theory of memory - I don't have to remember the particulars of each chunk; just what each chunk did.<p>Anyways, it's a big enough attraction to me now that I regret not having them available in my day-to-day languages.",1207452611

We need to realize there is such a thing as natural and good elitism.  This is an important ""thing that is not said.""<p>That being said, while stereotypes do have some kind of basis in reality (something has to perpetuate them) the problem comes when we say certain people are inherently inferior and do not have a free, moral accountable will.",1207452567

155974,comment,155717,155717,0,0,attack,,,"> To be selected to participate in Beilock and her colleagues’ first study of mathematical performance, for example, women had to perform baseline tasks with greater than 75 percent accuracy, and they had to agree with the statements “I am good at math” and “It is important to me that I am good at math.” Why do these things matter?<p>So people give up a little when others tell them that they are bad at what they've worked so hard to do well at, or do a little extra if superiority appears to be within reach. Seems like a whole lot of fluff for such a simple observation.",1207451754

It's a battle between BitTorrent and cable Internet providers.<p>I assert without evidence or significant analysis, but with some past experience: the products WaPo is talking about are used almost exclusively for two purposes:<p>* To enable ISPs to build ""fast-path"" offerings for ""premium"" Internet access for streaming media.<p>* To ratchet down the incredibly painful impact that BitTorrent and other ""always-on"" file sharing applications are having on ISP networks.<p>The irony is, the high-end products WaPo is talking about are the least applicable to NSA-style spying. The code handling the packets that AT&T shunted to NSA is crappy vanilla pcap; any of us could write it.",1207451622

It's all written in C, surprise!<p>On the very high end, or in very specialized cases, you'll find:<p>* FPGA regexers, OEM'd from a couple common vendors, that compile DFAs into gates.<p>* Multicore ""network processors"" with MIPS cores and fast custom memory busses.<p>* Blades that connect into the backplanes of (ubiquitous) Cat6k switches to intercept traffic.<p>By and large, this is a systems design problem, not an algorithms challenge. To appreciate that, you have to get the context for this WaPo story, which includes the fact that the story is totally overblown and ISPs are not reading your email or web traffic, but rather trying to figure out how to commercialize a ""fast-path"" network product for bulk P2P/streaming media customers.",1207451324

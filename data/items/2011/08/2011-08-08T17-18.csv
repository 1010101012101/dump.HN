And copying is so overrated these days. By that I mean people forget that's how companies compete <i>in the same space</i>. They copy features from other and improve on them, or take the product in a different direction, and that's exactly what the founder of rolling.fm said he's doing.<p>If each and every company had to do something 100% original, there wouldn't be a Pepsi to Coca-Cola. They didn't copy the exact formula of Coca-Cola, but I'm sure the author of Rolling.fm didn't copy the source code of turntable.fm either. He just made it similar enough to compete in the same space, but also different enough to be compelling over turntable.fm. And <i>that's</i> how companies compete with <i>each other</i> in every industry or market. And that's how progress happens and technologies evolve.<p>People seem to be making such a big deal out of copying these days, because of all the patent lawsuits, which don't really allow you to do that. And that's another reason why the patent system is so broken. It doesn't take into account how business works in the real world.",1312826384

2860944,comment,2859909,2860614,2,0,tripzilch,,,"I think that is a good addition. If I may make one more suggestion, is that you state at the start of your article, how your goal differs from that of the Mandelbulb project: that you seek for mathematical elegance, while the Mandelbulb project first and foremost went for finding a 3D visual equivalent of the classic Mandelbrot shapes.<p>About skipping sections: the only bits that I skipped were the bits that I already knew :) I did love the visualisations of transformations in the complex plane, however. Very nicely done.<p>I did not understand what you were trying to say with the animated GIF about branches being arbitrary. Obviously something about the complex square root having two solutions, but how that relates to the image with rotating colours isn't quite obvious to me.<p>Also the part about the operations on sets isn't as clear as it could be. It's very intriguing though, yet another way of thinking of complex numbers that I didn't know yet :) I think it would become a bit clearer if you'd add axes to the image. Even better if you can also put angles (0, pi/2, pi, ..) in it.<p>BTW one very cool way in which complex numbers were explained to me when I was 16, does explain something you gloss over a bit in the ""complex analysis"" section. Why is the imaginary axis perpendicular to the real axis?<p>The way it was explained to me, is to think of the (real) number line, and how a multiplication by -1 is visually the same as a rotation by 180 degrees around the zero.<p>Now what if you'd decide to rotate 90 degrees instead? Such a crazy idea! You'd get a second number line. Let's call a rotation of 90 degrees to multiply by i.<p>So if we multiply 3 by i we get 3i, and if we multiply it again, it rotates 90 degrees further and we get -3. So that means 3 * i * i = -3 and i * i = -1, so i is the square root of minus one! Insanity! (the 16 year old me was giggling like a madman at this point)<p>(so yeah the explanation I got kind of started the other way around, with the 90 degrees angle first, and only ""discovering"" that this implied the square root of minus one after that)",1312826329

This question is classic DP.  A[i] stores the segmentation of the first i letters if it exists (or it can just store a boolean, depending on implementation).  Then to compute A[i] you look at the j<i see if A[j] is non-empty and if the [j,i) substring is in the dictionary.  If you find a valid j you set A[i] accordingly, otherwise leave it empty.",1312826314

Most of the 3D slices objects are Quaternion julia sets, which I suppose you already are familiar with.<p>I used to explore fractals using the oldskool DOS program called FRACTINT, which had an extensive hypertext-like documentation system, maybe they have something:<p><a href=""http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/findex.html#search_anchor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/findex.html#search_...</a><p>... I think what comes quite close is what they call a ""julibrot"" type fractal, which consists of layered julia fractals:
<a href=""http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/juliabrot_type.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/juliabrot_type.html</a><p>It's not as pretty as your renderings, though. But remember the Fractint software is decades old :)<p>Also see the other skytopia link below, where he explains his attempts at making a 3D Mandelbrot before the Mandelbulb was discovered, and why he considered those other 3D Mandelbrots not ""the real thing"".<p>> I suppose the aesthetic shortcomings are what most people are concerned with, though some people, such as myself, were disappointed by how mathematically arbitrary it is.<p>Yes, I can completely understand that. Personally, I care about both. I truly think that the shapes you get when making 3D slices of mandelbrot/julia parameter space are too warped, stretched and unrecognizable.<p>I suppose the biggest problem I have with them is that the stacked taffy-like chewing gum structures actually <i>obscure</i> the familiar beauty of the spirals/coral/tree structures. They are still in there, but only if you know how to slice the object, from the outside it looks like a (very complex and beautiful in its own way) tangled mess.<p>And that is the problem that I think the Mandelbulb solves beautifully. Even though the maths are sadly arbitrary. The sheer visual overkill of eyecandy does tip the scale for me, in the short term, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't keep looking for something that is mathematically more ""right"", and possibly even prettier.<p>> The sad thing is that most people don't even understand the math behind the Mandel* sets enough to be able to care about such things.<p>Well, you wouldn't be able to implement a Mandelbulb, or even come up with the formulas for it without a good solid understanding of complex math. In fact, the Mandelbulb formulae went slightly over my head [I could probably understand them if I took a bit more time, though].<p>> >So, the blog-article's author's implication that his is the ""real"" 3D Mandelbrot set, specifically referencing the Mandelbulb fractal, is just plain inaccurate.<p>> Again, it would seem that this would depend on the metric you apply.<p>Yeah sorry I think I wasn't quite clear. I got the idea that you were trying to improve on the Mandelbulb fractal. And the Mandelbulb fractal's formula was <i>designed</i> with the purpose of producing the same visual complexity in 3D as the classic Mandelbrot does in 2D. They already realized that just using Quaternions or stacking the parameters the way you have done, results in stretched-taffy objects that lack any of the visual beauty of the classic Mandelbrot. They felt that this couldn't be the ""right"" 3D representation of the Mandelbrot.<p>As you can see, they already went there, and tried loads of variations:
<a href=""http://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/mandelbrot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/mandelbrot.html</a><p>So where I got confused is that you started out referencing the Mandelbulb project, and I assumed you had the same goals as them but did a better job at it.<p>And as you can see from the above article, it's almost as if you retraced their steps backwards, than if you actually improved the Mandelbulb.",1312825123

Granted, I've been living under a rock for the past few months (startups tend to do that, even for people on the ""business side""). It could be that I missed the big event which prompted this debate.<p>My second question has two parts: Why is the US government so recalcitrant when it comes to changing an obviously broken intellectual property system, especially as it relates to science and technology? And, other than writing vitriolic blog posts and inveighing against the USPTO and so-called ""patent trolls"", is there anything else weinnovators, technologists, hackers, artists, and what have youcan do to change things?<p>A third question goes out to those in the HN community who hold patents, whether hardware, software, or (as is often the case) vaporware. Why did you patent your thing? Was it on the suggestion of a lawyer, your investors? Did you file a patent application without any advice, just because you wanted to? I'm curious.<p>Anyways, just a few questions. It'll be interesting to see how the discussion unfolds.<p>Best,
Jason",1312824915

physics is a phase space rather than spacetime. Descriptions of particles propagating and interacting in spacetimes are constructed by observers, but different observers, separated from each other by translations, construct
different spacetime projections from the invariant phase space. Nonetheless, all observers agree that interactions
are local in the spacetime coordinates constructed by observers local to them.<p>This framework, in which absolute locality is replaced by relative locality, results from deforming momentum
space, just as the passage from absolute to relative simultaneity results from deforming the linear addition of
velocities. Different aspects of momentum space geometry, such as its curvature, torsion and non-metricity, are
reected in different kinds of deformations of the energy-momentum conservation laws. These are in principle
all measurable by appropriate experiments. We also discuss a natural set of physical hypotheses which singles
out the cases of momentum space with a metric compatible connection and constant curvature.</i>",1312823963

They can't disclose any information about the patents since they haven't been granted yet, and they can't just tell me not to do it a certain way.<p>I can't go into details about the specific part that faces potential patent issues since I don't want to jeopardize my project or my job.<p>My question: should I submit mock-ups for approval and deal with any restrictions that arise as a result or should I just keep working on the project in my free time, but not open source it until whenever I choose to leave the company? I won't leave for several years unless the project gets really popular. I have already verified that this wouldn't be an issue if I wasn't an employee of the company (I asked the patent lawyers ""So if I did it in a way you didn't like, could I just quit and that'd be the end of it? -- Yes"").",1312823434

Of course, you could further outsource it from TAs to a 3rd party, but TAships have the dual role of funding grad students, so it might not save the university money to get rid of them, if they still plan to support grad students to the same extent as currently--- they'll have to find some other way to funnel that money to them.

For example, there are ways of solving math or comp sci problems (including simple ""typos""), especially when you don't understand the rules properly, that will give a correct result, for the wrong reasons.<p>I would much rather a math or computer science teacher be looking through the process used to find the answer - and providing constructive feedback.<p>Just getting a quick yes/no response back seems a lot less helpful to me. I don't know how much the human graders mentioned in the article actually do in terms of feedback, but I imagine we're still a ways away from a program having insight into WHY you chose the wrong method or made the mistake you did. The program can't help tailor their teaching to help set you straight.<p>Of course, my view on this is likely clouded by the fact I went to a small school with small class sizes throughout. When you only have 5-20 people in each class, direct professor engagement happens. If I had to deal with TAs, I don't know how I would feel about the matter.",1312823411

2339893,comment,2339073,2339088,0,0,AffableSpatula,,,"Sorry that's wrong; neither REST as a style or HTTP as an implementation are RPC. One of the key components of REST is Layering which is made possible because REST is distinct from RPC. This is covered in the dissertation:<p><a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluatio...</a><p>6.5.2 HTTP is not RPC<p>People often mistakenly refer to HTTP as a remote procedure call (RPC) [23] mechanism simply because it involves requests and responses. What distinguishes RPC from other forms of network-based application communication is the notion of invoking a procedure on the remote machine, wherein the protocol identifies the procedure and passes it a fixed set of parameters, and then waits for the answer to be supplied within a return message using the same interface. Remote method invocation (RMI) is similar, except that the procedure is identified as an {object, method} tuple rather than a service procedure. Brokered RMI adds name service indirection and a few other tricks, but the interface is basically the same.<p>What distinguishes HTTP from RPC isn't the syntax. It isn't even the different characteristics gained from using a stream as a parameter, though that helps to explain why existing RPC mechanisms were not usable for the Web. What makes HTTP significantly different from RPC is that the requests are directed to resources using a generic interface with standard semantics that can be interpreted by intermediaries almost as well as by the machines that originate services. The result is an application that allows for layers of transformation and indirection that are independent of the information origin, which is very useful for an Internet-scale, multi-organization, anarchically scalable information system. RPC mechanisms, in contrast, are defined in terms of language APIs, not network-based applications.",1300442305

2339881,story,,,46,34,wasigh,"Ask HN: sideproject, generating revenue & profit what's next?",,"Let me first give an introduction. I'am a 30 year old dutch software developer working at one of the largest internet companies in The Netherlands. My wife is a Highschool teacher, teaching Dutch language to 13- 15 year olds.
Almost 3 years ago we build a website for here students to use. After a few months it took off and visitors are climbing. From our stats we see that a lot of schools are using it. We got good media coverage and top-5 rankings in google for important keywords. The succes came as a surprise to us and we decided to create a business out of it.<p>We provide 250 free exercises and since a year we also provide subscriptions: personal subscription (5 euro / year) and classroom subscription (35 euro / year). With a subscription customers have access to their performance report and a few ""member-only"" exercises. With a classroom subscription a teacher can see the results of their students, look into the exercices they made and what mistakes they made. And some other extra functionality.<p>All this functionality is primarly used & tested by my wife and her class. For us it is a sideproject; it is generating revenue & profit, a couple of hundreds a month. Enough for me to cover my hosting expensives, and working less hours at my day job.<p>My wife is very clear: she is a teacher and wants to teach. She doesn't want to persue the business fulltime. Also she is pregnant with our first child. So technically: I'm the one running the business and my wife is my biggest (& most influentual) customer.<p>I'm not sure what to do next: we have a few hundreds a month and I would really want to grow. So I can work even less at my day job and more on our project.<p>But we have a hard time figuring out how to scale:<p>* Selling to schools is hard, even more without dedicated sales. With keeping the price low we think it's easier for schools to buy.
* The succes of the website started with the free exercises and quality content. We got a lot of free press with that. We don't want to risk our name with making it all premium content
* We don't want to run advertising as it would distract students, and make schools don't want to use it anymore.
* I work at the website besides my main job, doing all the coding and administration stuff 
* My wife doesn't want to sell (the website is tied to her lastname) 
* We are anxious to get outside funding, we want control over the project ourselves
* We are afraid to charge more (risk of losing customers)
* We only want to go into different subject when we can find good teachers who can create quality exercices.<p>Sofar the options are to creat more verticals (we need subject experts there) or create a better site.<p>So what to do? I would really like more time to develop more functionality. We get a lot of e-mails asking for different kind of exercises. Which I simply don't have the time for to develop. I feel we are an unique team: teacher and softwaredeveloper working together. I think we have a great oppertunity to create a big product. Good software is a huge gain for edecution.<p>But I don't know how to execute on this oppertunity, any tips?",1300441677

People tell you to believe it just because they said so.<p>I neither deny nor confirm the existence of this so called 'Holocaust' because I wasn't there when it happened. And we all know history is written by the winners. I have witnessed first hand how much lies are contained within those history books, that's why I simply don't care and don't believe anything they say.<p>Also a lot of people died for stupid reasons not just the jews, I don't know what makes them more special than anybody else.<p>Downvoters: please elaborate before just downvoting because I hurt your beliefs.",1300439152

I don't know what the result of this was, but do Facebook really have the trademark of -book in any social networking context?<p>I want to start a site, say vegetablebook, that contains recipes but also has a social element. Should I not do this for fear of being sued?<p>[1] http://goo.gl/w9SAz",1300439038

Paper as a concept needs to die. Not replaced with technology, but literally made extinct.<p>Paper is just a medium for information to exist. The medium doesn't need to be replaced. It should be bypassed. I think it's a habitual crutch workers have, to print information out, for it to be tangible.<p>I agree that although horribly inefficient, paper is cheap (even with printing expenses), and thus attractive compared to buying everyone an iPad. That's unfortunate because I believe it handicaps workers by acting as an unnecessary bottleneck when it should be completely removed from the information workflow wherever possible.",1300438933

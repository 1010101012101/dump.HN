After all, serious interruptions of food (virtual water) would also stop highly developed economies in their tracks. It seems a crucial test for his thesis, but he doesn't clearly address it.<p>Is it just that trade in oil is more easily controlled because (1) it has few sources, and (2) the economy of a country that sells food is itself hugely dependent on those sales? (that is, symbiosis is the best foreign policy?)",1237881296
529872,comment,529425,529425,0,0,10ren,,,"Summary: By importing a year's worth of food for one person, you save the 1,000 cubic metres of water per year that would be required to grow it. Thus, you import 1,000 cubic metres of <i>virtual</i> water (perspective: you only drink <i>1</i> cubic metre pa). Lesson 1: you need a cool pitch to sell your thesis/product.<p><i>my publishers pointed out that predicting an absence of war over water would not sell.</i> Lesson 2: not every cool thesis/product has a market.",1237881290

By the time you start uni, you either have peers from school or peers from outside school who you found because there were no other weird people in your school. There's nothing special going on at uni and whatever there is is perfectly accessible to everyone else.<p>I'd say the connections in my extended social network are 5% through high school, 1% through uni, 10% through doing random stuff and the rest through friends. That network provides me with a more or less steady supply of jobs, girlfriends, cool dudes and assorted adventures. And, it's part of the real, permanent world and not some expensive fantasy camp that you have to leave behind when the vacation's over.<p>Maybe things are different here, but if it works for us, it can work for anyone, and economics may soon force the matter.<p>If people want to hook up, get high and party, they'll make it happen wherever they are and whatever they're doing, so they might as well be doing something useful.",1237878960

Even if the USD halves in value then the total impact is less than 25% on the SDR.

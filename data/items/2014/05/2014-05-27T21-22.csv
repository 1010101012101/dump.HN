If you are truly burnt out or you are in financial trouble, then I certainly would recommend to stop. Otherwise, just take a two week break and find someone to help with the business side of things.<p>I think a lot of the billing stuff can be handled by Stripe or a similar service. For legal, finding a good lawyer is most of the work. After that, they will guide you through the rest.",1401227914
7807142,comment,7805944,7806279,4,0,danbruc,,,"I am pretty sure this is not related to local realism. I would naively imagine the situation as follows (not having read anything related in detail and not being a physicist). The forces between particles become very weak with growing separation but never become zero. Now imagine throwing two ping-pong balls into a pool making ripples on the surface similar to the force field or the probability of presence of the particles. There will be a interference pattern and you can probably find a valley where you can place a third ping-pong ball and it will sit there more or less stable. Now finally imagine every pair of ping-pong balls forming the valley for the third ping-pong ball. This may of course be incredible far off from what really happens - just making up images.",1401227900

That&#x27;s the worst of both worlds.<p>By the way, I keep hearing that phone companies have already set up e-com sites for Law Enforcement to retrieve phone tracking records (which do not require a warrant) Punch in your department&#x27;s credit card number, type in the guys phone number, and get a record of everywhere he&#x27;s been.

7807095,comment,7806528,7806528,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"I&#x27;ve seen two major developments beyond the traditional published-once book.  This article talks about one of them: &quot;Unfinished&quot;, whether for fictional works with multiple editions or edited versions (as in this article), or for non-fiction references continuously updated to cover the latest version of the topic they document.  However, this article still assumes a punctuated series of versions in essentially complete form, intended to be thought of as a complete book, even though the author may release a new version in the future.<p>There&#x27;s a step beyond that sense of &quot;unfinished&quot;: the future of the book is <i>in progress</i>, actively being written and edited.  There&#x27;s something particularly fun about reading the first few chapters of a book whose ending is <i>not yet written</i>, providing feedback, having a conversation with the author, and seeing that feedback reflected in the next update.  See a typo, or a plot hole?  Post a comment with a bug report.  Having that experience with software was what hooked me on Open Source; however, that experience is not by any means limited to software, and it&#x27;s quite a thrill for books (fiction or non-fiction) as well.<p>Having that feedback and update channel pervasively available really changes your outlook on prose, as it does with software.

(Sure, you can believe that I feel a little personal betrayal there, but there&#x27;s also a concern that the Rakudo developers were taking on yet another project for which the bus number is, as usual, abysmally low.)<p>Two, because the resulting design (when I looked at it) was adequate, at best. I believe it won&#x27;t compete with fast VMs without a serious change in its architecture, and no amount of magical thinking about how a GSoC student will build a JIT in 10 weeks will fix that.<p>Three, because it represents yet another example of NIH thinking and throwing out working code in favor of spending even more time building something new from scratch.<p>Four, because it set back the P6 release date by at least 18 months, if not years.<p>Five, because all it represented when I looked at it was the kind of code shuffling that Parrot could easily have done in the past three years, without doing anything much else (such as make the architecture improvements we&#x27;d begun to design and prototype).<p>One fact often forgotten in all of the nonsense about how &quot;Parrot lost its focus and thus its purpose&quot; is that Parrot was, from the start, intended to run at least both Perl and P6 simultaneously in the same process without embedding <i>libperl.so</i>.",1401227311

I tried to make sure that was obvious.  Perhaps I failed.<p><i>More than that, Moar&#x27;s development began in secret around that time</i><p>I&#x27;m aware, which is one of the things I was alluding to when I mentioned &quot;among other reasons&quot; for not working on MoarVM.  Beyond not knowing it existed, when they did there was probably a feeling of betrayal.  I&#x27;m not trying to ignore that. The shame is that some of these people would most likely have enjoyed working on MoarVM if things had played out differently.<p><i>My impression then was that, if Rakudo hadn&#x27;t chased away Parrot developers and Parrot were free to ignore pesky things like backwards compatibility, deprecation, and users who wanted it to continue to work, Moar looked a lot like Parrot would have after the same time period. It was pretty disappointing.</i><p>That actually sounds like <i>praise</i> to me (barring some of the architectural missteps you allude to earlier in your statement).  That MoarVM was able to mostly get to where you think Parrot could have been if it had been able to ignore a lot of extremely hoary and cumbersome problems seems like a good thing.  Did you find it disappointing because of MoarVM specifically, or because of the realized loss of potential from Parrot?<p>In the end, if the Parrot split solved some P6 roadblocks, and spurred more rapid P6 development, which I believe it did, I have to count the action as a wide choice.  I found Parrot interesting in it&#x27;s goals, but it&#x27;s target of being a VM for scripting languages was starting to get competition from the JVM, which I&#x27;m not sure it could compete with.  P6, on the other hand, still hasn&#x27;t seem a competitor feature-wise IMHO to make me think it&#x27;s future is in doubt from an outside source (whether it will ever be <i>successful</i>, however you define it, is a different question).

Perhaps in 10-15 years, there will be predictions of India as the new number one.<p>China&#x27;s demographic time bomb has been predicted for some time.  The one-child policy combined with factors like de-ruralization and widespread female infanticide and abortion will make China&#x27;s population implode dramatically by about 2060 to less than a billion and continue declining through the end of the century[2].<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is projected[3] to grow to 400 million by that time [EDIT: by 2060].  With a relatively young population in the industrial world, and a uniquely high immigration population, the U.S. is more like a developing nation than the other industrial powers, demographically speaking.  Youth brings new ideas and energy, something that is an essential factor in economic growth.<p>China&#x27;s elderly population is growing and will become a huge burden by the middle of the century, which will sap its wealth and probably prevent it from achieving the &quot;number one&quot; status that some are predicting.<p>Declinism is a cyclical phenomenon in the U.S. that is not without merit given our social and financial problems, but it must be viewed in perspective.  The debts are possibly the biggest problem facing the country, but new trends are going to counter that debt and possibly ameliorate it:  a coming boom in domestic energy production, a return of manufacturing to the U.S. driven by robotics and 3-D printing technologies, continued software dominance, and a culture of risk taking and open mindedness.  I think there&#x27;s still a lot of upside to the U.S. as a predominant power in the world.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/43988/samuel-p-huntington/the-us-decline-or-renewal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/43988/samuel-p-huntin...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.china-profile.com/data/fig_WPP2010_TotPop_Prob.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.china-profile.com/data/fig_WPP2010_TotPop_Prob.ht...</a><p>3. <a href=""https://www.census.gov/population/projections/data/national/2012/summarytables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.census.gov/population/projections/data/national/...</a>",1401224726

The US certainly has its faults, but it comes in at #3 on the UN&#x27;s Human Development Index. Why not show data from the top 20 nations on that list? Is there really a problem with finding &quot;religiosity&quot; data for Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Israel, and Singapore? (Ireland comes in at #7 in the latest ranking while the UK is #27, behind Slovenia, Spain, and Italy.) It appears he&#x27;s citing a 2009 Gregory Paul paper that argues the US is a more secular nation than a 2008 Baylor study indicated, which has me scratching my head.<p>The first world is an outdated term, originally used to describe the countries aligned with the US during the Cold War. I agree that it would have been better to use the top 20 nations on the UN&#x27;s HDI, but given the term the choice of countries was correct.<p>>Alas, immediately after stating the US is the worst of the lot in measurements including life expectancy in some manner because of its popular religiosity, he makes the case that religiosity is a social survival trait and shows a chart indicating that religious communes last longer than secular ones. At which point I found myself wondering exactly what point he was trying to make. Atheism is the way forward even though religious nations are more likely to survive? Which is a pity, because I quite agree with his larger points on government intrusions on our privacy.<p>A trait that causes cells to die at some predetermined time can benefit the organism as a whole, for example by preventing cancer. Similarly, Peter Watts seems to be arguing that although religiosity causes life expectancy and a whole slew of other important metrics to plummet, it strengthens the collective whole by building group cohesiveness.

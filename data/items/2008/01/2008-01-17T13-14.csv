99767,comment,99656,99656,0,0,edw519,,,"Let's not miss the critical ""take away"" message of this article...<p>Often, it's NOT the capabilities of the app that are the most important thing, it's the ABILITY TO CHANGE those capabilities quickly that matters most.<p>I've seen this over and over and over again in businesses.  When the app (often packaged) is missing a certain feature or capability, the organization will always find a way around it: a satellite app, an excel spreadsheet, pencil and paper, even hiring a few extra clerks.  But what really drives them nuts is when the business has a new critical requirement and the software can't be changed in time to meet it.<p>The examples are endless: we're running a special sale, we have a new temporary warehouse, the accountants insist on special security for certain classes of workers, Joe just found out that <abc> has happened in Duluth - if we knew <def> by 3:00, we could do <ghi>.<p>I know many business people that will only buy packaged software with source code.  They will not pay maintenance, and use the money instead to hire their own programmers.  It's THAT IMPORTANT that the software can ""turn on a dime"" to satisfy rapidly changing business requirements.<p>Bravo, pg, for doing something (however apparently minor) to bring this issue front and center where it belongs.",1200576869

99765,comment,99656,99758,0,0,eVizitei,,,"I disagree.  It sounds like you work for a company who has their build process worked out really well, so fast changes are less impressive to you, but have you considered that maybe your company is not the average?  I think it would be fair to say that most development shops are NOT that responsive to user changes because they don't have either the language features pg used, or a well-thought-out build process like your company.<p>If the article author works at one of those ""average"" shops, I think he has every reason to consider his experience on news.yc as a breath of fresh air and tell other people about it as an example.<p>Additionally, I think part of what impressed the author so much was that pg took the time to handle the request immediately.  This isn't a site anyone pays to use, there's no revenue incentive, and the request was not the early stage of a riot, but they took care of it as though it was as important as a paying customer relationship, and that's not a response you expect from most web services.  In fact, I think that may be what impressed the author more than just the speed of the fix.",1200576562

99758,comment,99656,99656,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"Stupid article.  Sorry.   The change that PG made is tiny.   So it was surely an easy change and so his responding in under 7 hours is hardly something to blog about.<p>Right now I'm working for a very large European web site that's entirely written in Java.   We make changes all the time (e.g. we probably make at least 3 code changes to the web site per day).   Doesn't need any magic PG pixie dust sprinkled on the engineers to make this happen.   What we do is run all our web server/app server combinations inside Solaris zones.  When we make a change we tell the production system to shutdown each zone when it's ready (finished with current requests) and load the new one.",1200575343
99757,comment,99595,99717,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I'm not saying it qualifies as a CDN - I'm pretty sure it wouldn't - just that it's more complex than simply putting stuff up on S3, and based on the info in the article, the above is my guess as to what they're doing. You don't get 1/4 of a penny per hour of flv by building a worldwide network of servers.<p>Well, perhaps if you were as big as Google you could. I don't know enough about the economics of scale. But you'd have to be doing some serious volume at the local internet exchanges.<p>By the way, I was kind of thinking out loud because I'm in the same position:<p><a href=""http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/rocksolidarcade.com?site0=rocksolidarcade.com&site1=justin.tv&y=r&z=3&h=300&w=610&range=6m&size=Medium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/rocksolida...</a><p>Bandwidth is averaging above 1mb per person (and growing - the new games are bigger than Stunt Pilot and people play more the more we have), which is probably quite a bit less than justin.tv, but still costly. I definitely won't leave the US for bandwidth, but I'll probably end up with a mixture of baseline servers, gigabyte per month servers and a mirror of static content ready on S3 (as well as a static version of the site), just in case too many of my servers go down at once or we get a massive traffic spike.<p>Maybe then I'll get a story on TC about how I've created a ""CDN"", and hey, I wouldn't email them saying remove the story, it's innaccurate. :)",1200575244

By default the user entered information is public (though there is a way to make it private as of yesterday) and none of the information in the profile is required.<p>What advice do you guys have on starting personal projects like this?

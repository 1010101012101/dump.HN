Bungolow is a members-only site featuring curated hotel bookings for the wide-open Latin American market. Check us out at www.bungolow.com.<p>The reason for the interesting location tag up top is that we are currently participating in a TechStars Network accelerator in Buenos Aires. After the program, we aim to locate in a large U.S. city. This means: a) if you are a U.S. citizen, you have the opportunity to come hang out in an awesome South American city for 3 months then return with us to the U.S. of A; or b) if you are from outside the U.S., we will do everything in our power to get a visa for you to work in the U.S. In both instances, having you with us in BA is preferred but not required.<p>We're looking for a lead developer to drive the technological direction of the company. This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a high-potential start-up. The right candidate will be considered part of the founding team.<p>We're not as concerned about your education background or prior work experience (or for that matter, even the technologies you code in) as we are of seeing evidence of stuff you have shipped. Please send us some links to things you have created online, and make note of your involvement in each.<p>Send to careers at bungolow dot com.",1333378651

OS/2 needed a graphic driver for the S3 chip.  I called DEC support to ask for the driver and they said they didn't have it but IBM did.  The DEC rep kept me on the phone while he called the OS/2 support number.  DEC had incredible service at the time.<p>Then the bizarre happened.  The IBM support person said I needed to sign an NDA to get the driver.  Both the DEC rep and I tried to explain to him I was a humble end user and not interested in anything but the driver.  There must be a mistake as I did not want source code.  Nope, just the driver required a NDA and some verification.  I said I would think about it, and we hung up.  The DEC rep apparently had quite a few people gathered around him and they were laughing pretty hard.  He then asked if I would like a nice copy of Win NT with no NDA and all the drivers for my machine.<p>I really wanted to like OS/2.",1333378082

So while consumed - burned = loss is still true, eating a diet that is high on carbs will reduce the amount of calories you burn from the same caloric intake.<p>Carbohydrates also have the added problem of making your blood sugar swing, which leads to hunger pangs and bigger appetites.<p>Paradoxically, it's not fat that makes you fat, it's hormones and pasta/rice/potatoes/bread/sugar because they mess with those hormones.<p>If your body wants more energy, it will find a way to get it, either by inducing you to overeat, or by making you less active. So fixing your hormone balance (specifically insulin levels) is more effective than trying to control your food intake.<p>Of course, the fact that many restaurants and diners in the US serve really big portions, that most of us don't do a lot of exercise, that we have very easy access to high-calorie foods, that the food industry precision-engineers foodstuffs to be addictive... all of that surely doesn't help, but if Taubes is correct those environmental factors are not the chief cause of obesity.",1333377921

I learned all the major languages at the time, including Algol, PL/1, FORTRAN IV, Snobol, Basic Assembly Language, and my favorite back then - Lisp, i.e. Maclisp on the PDP-10. My first job was programming for a bank in COBOL, and I continued with commercial data processing for two decades. I bought a TRS-80 in 1978 and programmed it in Basic as well as assembler. Likewise I built and programmed an x86 PC every couple of years since they came out. In the early 1990's, the utility company I worked for switched new projects to Smalltalk. And in the mid 1990's I learned Java. In 1999, I began working for Cycorp in Austin where I returned to lisp, and a bit of Java. Since 2006 I have been programming Java and some JavaScript.<p>At 60 years old, I look back on a long career of programming - with the most exciting work coming late in life as a founder of a tech startup - Android, websockets, semantic web, natural language processing, and programmable web.

friendly in size, to use and learn on experience.
Most important you don't have to be computer
programmer, or even typist, to use it!<p>If you're first time computerist, this manual will provide an
excellent introduction to computing. Unlike most instruction
manuals, you don't have to read through this whole book to get
to the ""good stuff."" After reading Chapter (GETTING
STARTED), you can go directly to chapter that interests you
and start reading. If you're interested in animation turn to
Chapter 4. If you like music, try Chapter 5.<p>The first page of each chapter has sample program to start
you off. Just type the program exactly as shown (""Try Typing
This Program"") and see what happens. The rest of the chapter
explains what you did, and shows how to do more. Chapter
summarizes some important programming concepts, and
explains the techniques used in sample programs.""<p>(The manual was the baby of Michael S. Tomczyk, who wanted to strongly focus on the ""user friendly"" aspect of the VIC, including for programming)<p>Then you'd turn to chapter one, and start typing in the first example program:<p><pre><code>   1 PRINT ""VIC20""
   2 GOTO 1
</code></pre>
You then had an approximately 150 additional pages explaining how to use the machine that for the most part assumed that ""use"" meant ""program"" - only a tiny fraction of the manual dealt with non-programming related activities. My dad learnt BASIC from that manual, and I learnt BASIC from him and went on to improve my skills with nothing but the Commodore 64 manual when we upgraded. Commodore continued that tradition with the Amiga, up until AmigaOS 2.04 (which came with ARexx, but not AmigaBASIC) but pushed it far less on the Amiga than on its 8-bit machines.<p>That's a large part of the difference: If you bought most home computers back then, and _especially_ Commodore machines, you got programming showed in your face - User was equated with programmer. And though a lot of people learnt how to load games and didn't bother with programming, the threshold to actually finding something exciting in programming was far lower.<p>I'm not suggesting we go back to the days where people get a BASIC prompt on starting a machine, but surfacing scripting capabilities for automation more, for example, would make a big difference.<p>Consider even something as trivial as macro recording that displays what it records and give people an easy way of modifying it, instead of hiding it ""behind the scenes"".<p>A lot people are programmers today because the plumbing was out in plain view and some of us found it fascinating and started figuring out what it did.

Anyone can do this. Then try to ""buy"" this so called data they're collecting and selling. You can't, because there's no such thing. This myth of Google or Facebook selling your information to advertisers is really silly and very easy to debunk it yourself if you really want to. These are spread by either sensationalist tech bloggers who barely understand technology or by FUD'ers who make money off spreading this, such as DDG (who explicitly points this on their website).<p>> but it really doesn't matter as long as I have the perception that my private data is being sold off to the highest bidder and I choose to do something about it.<p>My argument is that you're a minority, which would make little difference if people like you could opt out (just like you already can opt out of social search).<p>And also that their model is not completely dependent on it.

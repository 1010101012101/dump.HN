Whoever made it had to know specific things about the hardware being used in Iran, the network there, and machine code for the motors that were affected. Then they had to hide the whole thing in a virus in such a way that it took a while for the experts to figure out what was actually happening and where.<p>The idea could be used, sure: find some important place that you want to damage in some way. Find out if it has computers that hook into some kind of specialized hardware. Work out how that hardware can be damaged via those computers. Find out how those computers are vulnerable. Write an overly-complicated virus that hides what it's really doing, and set it loose, and hope it makes it all way to those specific computers, and delivers its payload. ...it kinda sounds like a single-use case, really.<p>More likely, stuxnet is just encouraging people (governments, whatever) to consider attacks that target non-computer run systems. The motors being damaged in Iran, if I understood it correctly, weren't being run by computers, just programmed by them.

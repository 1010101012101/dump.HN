With the right provider the users will not think that the site is noticeably slower and you won&#x27;t need such high monetisation targets to break even. Then, as the site gains traffic, simply scale the level of hosting accordingly.<p>I hope this is of use!\nSam",1443117586

The real problem is are people growing up in a society where they are being subconsciously funnelled towards a particular choice (to the point where they don&#x27;t see other options as valid choices due to subconscious biases).<p>You just have to look at all of the crazy responses to Target (a US retailer) removing the gender-specific labelling of toys (from &quot;Girl Toys&quot; and &quot;Boy Toys&quot; to just &quot;Toys&quot;) to see how as a society we are not at a point where &quot;we&quot; aren&#x27;t trying to impose a particular ideal (e.g. &quot;Barbies are girl toys&quot;) on children as they grow up.<p>> Two people in a partnership raising the children they love together using division of labour?<p>This is more generic than the &quot;nuclear family&quot; traditionally is viewed.

That said, sometimes materials inside the machine catch fire, and sometimes the beam reflects or dwells on a section of the metal enclosure. It&#x27;s interesting that they&#x27;ve chosen to make the entire (?) enclosure out of plastic, itself a combustible material. I get why they went with plastic (cheaper to fabricate once you have the molds, lighter to ship, perhaps better dimensional accuracy than cheap sheet metal), but it does not seem particularly safe. The also seem to gloss over the need to ventilate the machine. Plastic fumes are nasty to breathe, glue-bonded wood (think thin plywood) can release formaldehyde fumes, leather may be dyed with heavy metals. What the laser doesn&#x27;t cause to combust cleanly, it vaporizes. You don&#x27;t want those emissions in your house of office, and you want them vented away from the optical components as quickly as possible so there is no deposition onto mirror or lens surfaces.<p>Another benefit of metal enclosures is shielding the power supplies of these things. High-voltage laser power supplies are noisy, and when you PWM them, they can cause quite a bit of interference. Metal enclosures at least help to attenuate RF emissions.<p>The &quot;macro camera&quot; is a clever addition for closed-loop optical control (if it is being used for that). Reminds me of attaching an optical mouse sensor the the lens sled.<p>1. <a href=""https://igcdn-photos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t51.2885-15/e15/10549813_673074649438401_1078246007_n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://igcdn-photos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t51.28...</a><p>2.

10273252,comment,10272483,10272483,0,0,chromaton,,,"This looks like a decent laser but I thought I&#x27;d post a few thoughts about this package which might give a potential buyer pause.<p>First, the main unique feature I see is the built in camera which apparently gives you a preview of cut/engraved finished part on your computer screen with the material as it&#x27;s positioned inside the machine. This also (apparently, it&#x27;s not clear), allows you to correct for misaligned material inside the machine. These are nice features, but it&#x27;s perfectly possible to cut and engrave without them.<p>One big problem with operating this inside your home is the fumes. Now, they do mention that the base unit needs to be vented to the outside. What this means is that your neighbors (and you, if the wind is right) will have to smell the exhaust from this machine. It&#x27;s not a nice smell if you&#x27;re cutting acrylic. Though I personally got used to the scent of vaporized acrylic over time, your neighbors might not be so inclined.<p>So they also offer a $500 add-on  ($1000 regular price) to filter the air so you can exhaust inside. The add on is smaller than the already small laser cutter. This is quite a feat and I would really like to know how they got it to work. You see, the fumes/smoke from a laser cutter can really clog up a particulate filter pretty quickly. Wood produces wood smoke, and acrylic vapor is quite sticky when it settles. So you have to have a powerful pump to draw the fumes through the filter. Then you need a good amount of activated charcoal to get rid of the smelly stuff.<p>If you look at the professional model air filters, they&#x27;re $2000+ and you have to buy filters and media regularly.<p>Laser cutters get messy inside, so if you buy one, be prepared to clean it out regularly to keep the optical and mechanical components clean.<p>Problems with operation can START A FIRE, so be prepared to watch the machine 100% of the time while it&#x27;s cutting.",1443117018

For example, homelessness in LA is mostly due to the fact that jobs that could pay for someone to live there are relatively scarce (basically, cost of living is nuts in larger cities like LA, Chicago, NY, and etc). Add to the fact that state governments rarely if ever properly fund housing assistance in the US this makes it much worse in areas where even the cost of living is relatively low (like in rural parts of the US).

I have tmux macros setup to quickly get different pane layouts -- e.g. 65% left, then two vertical split panes in the remaining right 35%. Typically I run vim in the larger pane and then have two other panes for various other CLI stuff on dev systems. I have a number of other preconfigured layouts depending on what I&#x27;m trying to get done.<p>* tmux session can be detached/reattached. I&#x27;ve on occasion had iTerm crash or I&#x27;ve accidentally quit it (cmd-Q). With tmux, my session is still running, so I just restart iTerm and reattach...everything back where I left off. There is even a new-ish plugin for tmux that lets you save tmux sessions so that you can restore after restart. The reattaching also makes it low-overhead if/when iterm wants to update itself (admittedly rare).<p>* Once you get used to tmux navigation keys/commands, they will conceptually work on linux systems as well if you run tmux (more portable muscle memory).<p>just my $0.02",1443116595

10273191,comment,10271028,10272350,0,0,boken,,,"Hard wrapping may be an elegant solution on the runtime configuration side, but it is frequently to blame for inelegance when editing. Hard-wrapped text must be manually reformatted for display when (1) changing terminal or window size, (2) vertically splitting panes, (3) opening a file on a different monitor. Hard-wrapped text must also be manually reformatted after many editing tasks: new lines, far shorter in length than the <i>textwidth</i> of the paragraph as a whole, sit in the middle of old ones that wrapped naturally, while some old lines teeter out into your wrap margin (and off of your display) after text was inserted into their middles.<p>This solution, meanwhile, is far from inelegant:<p><pre><code>  nnoremap g gj\n  nnoremap k gk\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s it, once and done. Aside from setting your wrap preferences—which you would have had to do anyway with hard wraps—there&#x27;s no more to be taken care of. The text will always display fluently and in full, and you will have no need to manually reformat your paragraphs using <i>gqap</i> whenever you make a change to them.

VPNs typically do OK, except IPSec because the IETF didn&#x27;t want to admit that NAT existed (though I believe they cleaned that up with an add-on and things are mostly fine now.) As an end-user, hopefully your implementors have solved most problems for ya. As an implementor, SIP is a curse. (HTTP, which SIP drew its nutty parsing rules from, recently ditched the entire format in preference of a binary format. Not related to the IP-embedding-galore that SIP added, but still interesting to note.)<p>SIP does not &quot;work fine&quot; in an IPv4 only environment, as any NAT user will attest to.

Good luck buying fab time as TSMC, and having enough volume to justify it. You also need a design, thankfully the SPARC chips have open designs, but they are still really old for old fab tech. Good luck getting the engineers to update it.<p>You need mainboards, assembled somewhere (expensive) and fabbed (again, expensive). You could invent your own or reuse a published ancient print if any exist.<p>You would need open designed DRAM, and good luck trying to support modern iterations like ddr3 or 4 on old SPARC boards. I&#x27;m not aware of any DRAM being sold with open blueprints, but also have not looked much into it.<p>You would need open storage devices. No SSD or HDD qualifies today, since they all have proprietary microcode controllers. No open designs or firmware to be found there.<p>You would need a graphics accelerator. While there are some purely free software GPU drivers (Broadcom for the Raspi) none of the designs are open. Again, good luck.<p>All combined the cost of just getting these five core components in a firmware free / open design state is insane. It would be on the order of tens or hundreds or probably a billion or more USD just to get a few thousand units. And at those kinds of costs (lets say we are optimistic and sell 10,000 fully open computers) and say it cost only 100M to build them, they would be $10,000 each for what is probably as powerful as something proprietary you could pick up today for $50-100.<p>One day I&#x27;m absolutely certain there will be a sustainable market for such a computer, because with proprietary hardware and software you are guaranteed to eventually be screwed over. Its only a matter of how deep in the rabbit hole you want to get before you wake up and realize how bad an idea it is. Eventually, I am certain all hardware and software design will be open, its just a matter of how long we want to slow progress and risk our individual prosperity on proprietary tools until enough wake up to the problem.",1443115751

In particular I&#x27;m thinking of the fact that the compiler and what we now think of &quot;compiler warnings&quot; came from two different warnings (cc vs lint).  This is because the C compiler was the largest C program and generally took every bit of memory available to do it, there was no room for any kind of sanity checking on that code.  I&#x27;ve heard it said that to include a new feature &quot;n&quot; in the language, they generally had to rework at least some of the existing compiler code with feature &quot;n-1&quot; to simplify/shrink it enough to fit the new feature.<p>In that kind of environment you get a language with very little input checking, beyond the rules of the grammar itself (which was as small as possible).",1443115680

Some people just honestly don’t have to hold back because they are just not like that, at least not all the time.<p><i>Some</i> people don&#x27;t, sure. I was trying to make a generalization of what humans as a group are statistically likely to do; breaking it down, some humans would be assholes all the time, some a few rare times, and some never at all. (Side-point: don&#x27;t feel the need to defend yourself from statistical assertions about human behavior, they&#x27;re not intended as accusations: <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/04/about-isnt-about-you.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/04/about-isnt-about-you.h...</a>)<p>There are indeed real people who have real rage that they don&#x27;t get to express as often as they&#x27;d like, though. There are people with anger management problems, or aggressive mania. There are people feeling intense (sometimes justified!) frustration in some part of their lives. There are people who are just plain sadists, and either don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s such a thing as a willing masochist or can&#x27;t find one.<p>Let me draw a parallel: road rage. Depending on the culture of a particular area of the world, road rage can be either <i>taboo</i> or <i>permitted</i>. People everywhere get frustrated at the behavior of other drivers around them; that is never in question. It&#x27;s only whether they choose to let those other drivers know about it that changes with each culture.<p>I do agree that it&#x27;s possible some percentage of the assholish behavior is performance. (Though as I waved-vaguely-at in my previous post, if you can <i>detect</i> this sort of thing—read the intention in it—it stops actually seeming assholish and becomes more like friendly jibing. A large part of the <i>point</i> of 4chan is to engage in a digital communal game of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dozens"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dozens</a>, and a large part of becoming &quot;part of&quot; 4chan&#x27;s community is building up a tolerance to this.)<p>But real asshole behavior—not the clever insults written with a cool head, but rather the seek-and-destroy-the-vulnerable bullying that harkens grade school—is not something you do to seem clever or liked. In the real world, in small communities, it can maybe win you &quot;friends&quot; through intimidation (thus why some real-world bullies do it), but on an anonymous forum there&#x27;s just no gain in doing it but to hurt the other person. The sort of actually-hurtful things said by a bully aren&#x27;t celebrated as successful roasts; they&#x27;re just sort of left to sit there. When playing the Dozens, you don&#x27;t poke at actual hard spots in the other person&#x27;s life; it&#x27;s bad form.<p>Now, of course, there are sociopaths who enjoy causing chaos and &quot;stirring shit&quot;: the Iagos and Izaya Oriharas of the world. And 4chan <i>attracts</i> these sorts of people as well. But as much as they&#x27;re a negative force—encouraging people to cut off their toes, arranging raids, etc.—they&#x27;re rarely visibly assholes. In fact, they have to be a bit <i>charismatic</i> to get people dancing the way they want. And, oddly, 4chan seems to &quot;hold&quot; these sort of people at bay, as well; they identify with the community, attacking its enemies (Tumblr, say) and its obvious unaccustomed interlopers (&quot;newfags&quot;) but tend to stay out of the way of the average user.

The first is that people who are inclined to be optimistic about a tiny stake are qualitatively different.  The second is that the stake&#x27;s expected value (EV; probability * outcome) is not a sufficient metric upon which to estimate its utility to actual humans.<p>1. People who are, relative to a theoretically precise EV, optimistic about a tiny stake act qualitatively differently toward the organization than those who are neutral or pessimistic / jaded.<p>For example, a good friend of mine in school used to argue, &quot;why vote?  one vote can&#x27;t ever move the needle.&quot;  And he was, after a fashion, right: the expected value of your single vote in terms of affecting the outcome is nil.  But if you were looking to build an organization of people to achieve some political or social outcome, you would ceteris paribus want those who DO vote despite that expectation; voting here is a proxy for caring, motivation, social cohesion, deontological orientation, etc., not as the jaded comments here might suggest by analogy, mere innumeracy.<p>Similarly, and I want to take care to say that I hold this position only toward the case of creating high-growth uncertain ventures (startups) and not as a general prescription for society or the economy, those who eagerly accept and seek even a small ownership stake in the enterprise are going to be qualitatively different.  And you may very much want that, just as they want to be part of something they have some ownership in.<p>2. Convexity and utility functions.  Get over the idea that a dollar is worth a dollar.  The first dollar to the guy who needs that dollar for a bus ride home in the rain is worth more than the 1001st dollar to a similarly situated guy -- an easy proof of non-constant marginal utility.  But if you look into things like indivisibility and status tournaments, there&#x27;s lots of good research that points out that playing the lottery can be rational even with a negative expectation under certain utility functions.<p>In other words, a 5% cash raise, to a comfortable software dev whose needs and retirement at a middle-class level are nearly certain, may be less desirable than a smaller EV shot at a life-changing sum.  It may well be worth $10k to buy a &quot;lottery ticket&quot; at a one-in-two-thousand chance of a $10 M outcome ($5k EV).",1443114785

Branding, 2. Direct Response.  With &quot;Branding&quot; campaigns an advertiser just wants to get their name out there and very often, associated with a specific publisher (say Mercedes wants to be associated with The Economist)- the metrics that these types of campaigns are judged by are impressions (the number of people that view the ad) and are usually sold on a CPM basis (the advertiser pays $X for each 1000 views).  With &quot;Direct Response&quot; the advertiser actually cares about people clicking on the ad and &quot;converting&quot; on the landing page, big advertisers rarely do that, most often these campaigns are sold on a CPC (cost per click- the advertiser pays for each click) or CPA (cost per acquisition- the advertiser pays for whatever action the user completes on the landing page) basis.  So, in reality,  by viewing the ad you&#x27;re not actually ripping anyone off.<p>The only time the advertiser is ripped off, is when bad actors set up fake sites, add ad networks to the sites then drive botnet traffic that simulates a real person, then the advertiser really is getting ripped off.",1443114767

But if we start thinking of them as a round-trip representation that is also friendly to programmers, it doesn&#x27;t seem impossible to include comments and formatting as hints in the AST that compilers and interpreters ignore. Sort of the same way that many HTML and XML parsers keep track of comments and whitespace even though that generally gets ignored by code that uses the parse trees.",1443114531

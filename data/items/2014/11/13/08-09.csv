It&#x27;s not a compelling argument.<p>&quot;But this stuff wasn’t obvious at all. The MongoDB docs tell you what it’s good at, without emphasizing what it’s not good at. That’s natural.

Yoga is a discipline of practice - a way to develop a new set of habits of self-awareness and self-control via breathing techniques.<p>As a side-effect it calms the mind due to proper physiological balance (better saturation of hemoglobin, less tension in muscles, which in turn influences other sub-systems. such as digestive, etc.)<p>Yoga is the same kind of a necessary training routine as when children learn how to read before they could read &quot;serious&quot; books.

Once <i>the body</i> learns (new habits of keeping balance has been developed) you could ride any kind of bicycle and will never forget how to do it.<p>The bicycle you&#x27;re leaning to ride (by doing) with yoga is your own mind whose states you lean to control &quot;non-verbally&quot; via states of your body.",1415869083

8600553,comment,8594792,8599150,0,0,exDM69,,,"This is an aspect of multi-core programming. As the programmer, you must be painfully aware of the cache lines you&#x27;re touching and which cores touch them. Having two or more cores touch a cache line will cause expensive core-to-core synchronization taking place. The case is easier in a message passing system like yours, where the other core is clearly the sender and can flush the caches. In kernel space, you can disable caches or use write-combine or write-through caches for memory regions as needed but this isn&#x27;t really available in userspace.<p>This can happen in very unintuitive places. For example, in Java, array.size() reads from the same cache line as the beginning of the array. If you&#x27;re partitioning an array processing routine for many cores, you should not call array.size() to avoid very expensive synchronization.",1415868721

8600517,comment,8599391,8600422,0,0,doctorshady,,,"I&#x27;ve worked in audio engineering before. Generally speaking, I think the reason vinyl ends up sounding better isn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s necessarily a better medium. I mean, it&#x27;s certainly resilient, but it inherently has some limitations that make the mastering process a little different. Let me explain:<p>Digital audio has a very clearly defined limit as to how loud it can go. With magnetic tape, you have to consider the saturation point, or for vinyl, what the lathe cutting the master can physically cut, but depending on the conditions, how loud the actual medium can go changes.<p>With digital formats, it simply goes to 0 dBFS. Period. That&#x27;s a spot that&#x27;s clearly marked on most meters. If you exceed it, you&#x27;ll hear a very nasty sounding audible clipping, and a red light on your meter will turn on to let you know whatever you&#x27;re recording is too loud.<p>Anyway, in 1989, Sony came out with a digital &quot;brickwall&quot; limiting device that used a technique called lookahead to anticipate changes in loudness. Compared to conventional compression and limiting, it&#x27;s very transparent, and produces drastically less artifacts - desirable or otherwise when it works.<p>So when that happened, a shitton of developers came out with their own versions, and started accelerating what&#x27;s called the loudness war. Fast forward twenty five years, it&#x27;s very common for someone - whether it be a band member or a record label or somebody to use this tool very aggressively on their releases. You can push a brickwall limiter to quite literally absolute amplitude if you want - as in, the loudness level doesn&#x27;t change at all for the entire song. Much to the chagrin of some of the engineers who have to actually work the brickwall limiter, people will occasionally want that.<p>Anyway, back to the world of analog mediums. Without that clearly defined volume limit, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to be using a tool like that. That&#x27;s the biggest difference in how vinyl and CD/mp3 releases are made. Some people don&#x27;t like it ridiculously loud, others don&#x27;t like the distortion aggressive brickwall limiting introduces, but I think the physical inability to use brickwall limiting is what&#x27;s giving vinyl a comeback. Compare a vinyl/CD release of a Foo Fighters song for yourself if you want;<p><a href=""http://www36.zippyshare.com/v/58998249/file.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www36.zippyshare.com/v/58998249/file.html</a><p>tl;dr, digital releases can sound just as good as vinyl, but the people producing them don&#x27;t want it that way. People disagree. Therefore, vinyl ends up with better sound quality.<p>Further reading:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war</a><p><a href=""http://www.recordtech.com/prodsounds.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recordtech.com/prodsounds.htm</a>",1415868001

My word I&#x27;ll also take anything Unix over windows at the moment regardless of the tech. To be fair in the short term, windows is maximally productive but if you hit an edge case or a rough spot you&#x27;re SOL, especially if it involves Microsoft support or scripting. Rough edges cost me a lot of money and willpower.<p>An example: I opened a case when IE9 was in developer preview with partner support. When they rewrote the download manager in IE for this release they changed how download prompting worked and removed a setting from the UI (and left it in the registry). This broke ClickOnce launches entirely for over 2000 users for us. Fast forward nearly 5 years and it&#x27;s still broken, the case is still open and to get everything to work for the client we have to frig a registry setting on every workstation they roll out. That sucks for us and the client, badly.<p>This is a typical story for us. When you deal with VSTO, MSI packaging, managing large clusters of windows server machines, random bugs that just blow up in your face suddenly after working for years, signing code, trying to get repeatable builds out of a CLR solution and automating all of these things, forget it. PowerShell gets you 80% of the way there but the last 20% is a tar pit of pain and impossibility.<p>Now I&#x27;ve been in the Microsoft ecosystem for 20 years, certified and bought into it all. Perhaps I&#x27;m bitter and tired but I can&#x27;t see past all this experience and have mixed memories of c#. All I see is hung instances of visual studio and working out which project file is buggered and all this is destroying the best language I ever used. I don&#x27;t want to waste my life on giving them another chance.<p>There is literally none of the above on Unix platforms from experience. I&#x27;ve only encountered one bug in the last 15 years due to a CIFS kernel bug and RH fixed it within two days. I haven&#x27;t had any automation friction at all.<p>I&#x27;m worn out and confused to be honest when I read back this post.",1415867597

Consider our example code: Even though C# requires more lines of code to define a derivative of Shape, at a certain point it will <i>always</i> be easier to add new classes to C# than the corresponding variant to F# (see &quot;The Expression Problem&quot; - on the other hand, adding new functions that apply to Shape will be easier in F# than adding the corresponding new methods in C#). Also, F# is supposed to be a hardcore statically-typed language, but there are some advanced concepts (e.g. type classes) that are easy to realize in C# yet not in F#.",1415867406

Mainly for the lack of privacy (seems like 70% of apps I try to install wants access to my contacts at install-time. And the design. Oh god how many ugly things in the Play Store). The openness is Android isn&#x27;t an openness in practice. You would assume CalDAV and CardDAV would be a native feature like in iOS. Nope. You would assume you could uninstall non-critical apps. Nope. You would think 1Password could integrate itself to Chrome like on iOS? Nope. The back button is a story in itself. Go back? Exit app? Go to another app? The russian roulette back button got you covered. The way of selecting text in various places is also implemented in a similar mysterious way. And then you have whoever made the phone (Sony in my case) adding shit. Not only apps but core behaviours. When I long press on the home button Sony decided that Google Now could be easily available. Which is useful. But also they have Sony Whats New which is some weird little app that showcases some various content for sale from Sony.

And contrast them with install scripts, for example (considering the overhead of the VM and the issues in VM-host communication).<p>There are two use-cases - software that gets distributed to end-users for deployment, and internal software that gets deployed on your own (or cloud) infrastructure.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the 2nd case, which is more dominant. Why would I, as a developer, package my software with docker, if I can provide install scripts that do all of that, and thus have scriptable deployment without any extra overhead or learning curve?

This file may simultaneously write one register (&quot;A&quot;), read a second (&quot;B&quot;), and read or write a third (&quot;C&quot;). In a single clock cycle, the following occurs:<p>>a) one register is output to the Address bus and the ALU&#x27;s A input;<p>>b1) another register may be output to the Data bus and the ALU&#x27;s B input; or<p>>b2) data from memory may be input to another register;<p>>c) an ALU function is applied to A (and perhaps B) and the result is stored in the first (address) register.<p>I consider the 74172 a FOUR port register file, since it can  simultaneously perform two reads and two writes.

So whilst they likely know of more secure options like PGP or OTR, these are not what their target audience are using or have the capability to use - they are interested in keeping the dragnet for new recruits wide, so have to tailor their approach for the current generation, hence Telegram, which is supposedly secure and also already making inroads in the current market as an alternative to WhatsApp, and is less geeky than something like Signal.<p>I remember years back when I attempted the same problem with a thing called Wire, for activists, that I posted on here and combined Facebook/Twitter type stuff with &quot;secure&quot; messaging, which was a web based UI that implemented AES256 based browser encryption based on the Stanford JS library.

I remember reading and article[0] about a researcher using genetic algorithms on FPGAs. One paragraph stuck with me through all these years:<p>&quot;Dr. Thompson peered inside his perfect offspring to gain insight into its methods, but what he found inside was baffling. The plucky chip was utilizing only thirty-seven of its one hundred logic gates, and most of them were arranged in a curious collection of feedback loops. Five individual logic cells were functionally disconnected from the rest— with no pathways that would allow them to influence the output— yet when the researcher disabled any one of them the chip lost its ability to discriminate the tones. Furthermore, the final program did not work reliably when it was loaded onto other FPGAs of the same type.&quot;<p>Now, I agree with you that, even for a problem as simple as that one (or specially because it&#x27;s a simple problem, maybe) a &quot;normal&quot; algorithm would perform better. But the fact that the genetic algorithm was able to find the effects of magnetic flux (those five disconnected logic cells) in that specific FPGA is nothing short of brilliant.<p>The problem I&#x27;ve always seen (not an expert, by any means, but I&#x27;ve played around with them a bit) with genetic algorithms is that they require a weird balance. For simple problems, a normal algorithm will probably work better. As the complexity of the problem increases, the scoring and evaluating rules&#x27; complexity increases as well (I&#x27;ve got no hard data, of course, but my feeling is that the complexity of the scoring process increases much faster than the complexity of the problem), making a well thought algorithm a better/easier solution. This, and that any mistake in the scoring process might throw away thousands and thousands of generations.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/</a>",1448021902

These hypothesis are tested through experimentation, just like in other scientific fields.<p>> Smart heuristics beat these hybrid-genetic-memetic-algorithms all the time.<p>Sure, this is almost guaranteed by the &quot;no free-lunch theorem&quot;:\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem</a><p>There might be some exotic cases where genetic algorithms are actually the best solution, but nobody knows that.<p>But that&#x27;s not the point of genetic algorithms.

Whether hearing about a 1.42m high man brings up a vivid image immediately, or only after conversion to imperial measures. Not unlike how becoming fluent in a given second language means there are no longer any intermediates. Rather than having to think consciously of a certain sentence in your own native language and then converting that consciously to a sentence in the given second language, you can just immediately think of the sentence in the given second language.<p>This happens gradually of course, there are a few length measurements in feet & inches that immediately give me a clear/rich image of the intended length: 6 feet, my own height in feet/inches, etc. However, the set of imperial length measures for which this happens is much, much smaller than that for metric length measures. For instance, I have absolutely no clue how long a yard is, let alone a hundred yards, and how that relates to a mile.

It could be 5-10 years before the majority of Internet users are using browsers that pass it.<p>Maybe the version of IE released with Windows 7 will pass (IE 9?), but there are still people using IE 6 on Windows 2000, 7 years after IE 6's release (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer#Version_6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer#Version_6</a>) and 8 years after Windows 2000's release (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000#History</a>).",1222422441

315881,comment,315717,315860,0,0,witten,,,"It seems logical, but the problem with basing executive compensation on company performance is that, in a public company, it just incentivizes the executives to chase quarterly profits at the expense of medium- to long-term goals. This means that executives will do anything they can to pump up quarterly numbers, especially if they know that their tenure at the helm of their company is fairly finite.",1222421283

315878,comment,315796,315869,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I already mentioned TechStars hit rate, as far as I know it: ""has actually produced a couple of winners now"", in the form of two small acquisitions.<p>YC has had a couple of pretty big acquisitions and five (I believe) small acquisitions.  More importantly, I think there are at least three or four still on-going companies that will be very large successes for YC.  I won't name them, as it might imply that I think others won't be big successes or it might start a flame war over ""no way that blah blah idea can generate significant revenue, no matter how many million hits they get"", or whatever.<p>And the ""at this stage"" bit was in reference to the fact that about 50% of the first batch of YC founders are now rich, by a reasonable definition of ""rich"".  Each batch since then rolls off a bit, in percentages, but the bets are getting bigger and take longer to play out (our company, for example, would not be for sale for a low millions acquisition offer...but the vast majority of the exits for YC and TS companies have been in that range...and I know that a few other YC companies are also looking to build larger companies than that).<p>Anyway, by any metric YC has a lot of successful companies in their stable.  Traffic for a few YC companies is just through the roof (Scribd, Justin.TV, Weebly, Reddit, Disqus, probably others).  A couple of others have really impressive reach outside of the usual Web 2.0 set and into the ""real world"" (Loopt, in particular, though Inkling Markets is everywhere, too...<i>my dad</i> has used Inkling's product, and he just got broadband for the first time last week).",1222420801

There are part of the semantics I dislike, but the syntax is not hurting me that much.<p>Erlang's primary problem is that it currently can't cope with the things people try to throw at it. I've seen people opt for better string handling, but string handling isn't the force of the language. It is almost domain specific as a language.<p>Personally, I don't think Erlang is the answer to the ""multi-core-problem"" either. There has to be a nicer way than threads-on-steroids ;)",1222420059

The problem is finding it--particularly for a non-programmer.  DokuWiki is very nice.  Flyspray aint even half bad.  Wordpress, while extraordinarily popular, is a bit painful to look at...it's getting better, but it's not ideal to learn from (I'm not knocking Wordpress...I use it for two blogs and recommend it to everyone who asks about blogging software).  The majority of Joomla is downright scary bad--I feel dumber every day that I spend working with it.",1190674436

59122,comment,59051,59104,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Agreed.<p>\nThat's the trick -- a good mentor will show you the world and tell you about different places you might want to go. He can even help you book the ticket, but he can't make your decisions for you. A mentor is not a cofounder, is not a coder, and is not a partner. <p>\nIt's like my father-in-law, the carpenter who lives out of town. I know nothing of wood-working, so if I need some work done, I use him as a mentor. He doesn't show up and do the work, but he guides me around the arena and shows me what to worry about and what not to worry about. Maybe I'll hire out contractors, or maybe I'll do it myself. In the modern world, you can't do everything yourself, so it's good to have somebody with that information.<p>\nGood mentors are priceless, and we use them all the time without thinking about it. But you have to be clear about roles and expectations.",1190672541

59112,comment,58915,58988,0,0,ardit33,,,"That's complete bullsh!t.<p>It is execution that matters.  Ideas are a dime a dozen.  What google did was excellent execution of an non-original idea (there were lots of search engines at that time).<p>Look at the UConnect vs. Facebook.  vs. that other dude that that the same idea.\nFacebook was able to execute much faster and better and got traction, while Uconnect is just crap, and they have to resort to lawsuits.<p>Sure, if your idea is dumb to begin with,  then no matter how good the execution is, you wont get anything out of it.<p>But you still can change ideas and business plans around, and from a loser make a winner offering.  (many startups end up changing their ideas business models at some point, including the company I am working for).\nIf your execution team still sucks, your products will show it,  and the next guy that likes idea, will copy it, and make a much better version of what you are offering.  (just like  Friendster got hosed by poor execution).<p>But it is a common trait from ""Business"" people  that think ideas matter more.  It is more of a whishful thinking.  Honestly being good at business is nothing more that having a good common sense and street smarts, and knowing how to B.S. a little.  Things that no school teaches you.<p>\nSo my advice, learn how to build websites (as a programmer I'd like to concetrate on the harder stuff), do everything you can help the whole team,  (from marketing, getting graphics, building mock-ups or prototypes) etc..   While you don't have to program,  you better have some good technical skills, and really understand what's going on and how hard or easy is to do some stuff.<p>One thing that is very annoying, is how non-technical people think it is sooooo easy to just have an ajax drop down, or that little thing here, that little thing there, without having the slightly idea how much work it really takes.",1190671848

59110,comment,59036,59099,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"While I agree about the P/E ratios, I think Facebook has definitely started monetizing it's users, short of charging them a monthly fee anyway. Logging in now gives me a home page with banner ads to the left, and at least 3-4 ads in my 'News Feed'. Not to mention the marketplace aspect of it. If Facebook becomes the de facto identity manager on the web, I could see a sky high valuation like this, but I think they will piss off their users if they keep going like this.<p>I read somewhere else that they suspect that Microsoft just wants the 5% so it has more control over serving ads, much like Google owns 5% of AOL so it can serve a ton of ads to AOL users/visitors.",1190671680

59108,comment,58915,58977,0,0,Shooter,,,"""ideas aren't patentable""<p>That's true, but business methods and certain software implementations of novel ideas are patentable...at least in the US.  I've found that truly good ideas are easily translated into one or both of these.  The problem is, most people have ""me too"" ideas.<p>All philosophical arguments aside, the patent system can be an entrepreneur's best friend.   Yes, the system is heavily abused.

It's one thing to be a voice on the phone or an icon on IM, it's something else entirely to drop by for lunch, take a look at the build, and roll your sleeves up and pitch in. That's a face-to-face kind of thing. As another commenter pointed out, a lot of people don't feel like they need any help. Those that might entertain the idea want to see that you can walk the walk and not just talk the talk -- which is exactly as it should be.<p>\nSo I'd look locally if you can.",1190671228

Educated me a bunch, especially since the internet back then was super-primitive. People were using VBScript back then. I had no mentors, so when I took a look at Javascript, I got confused as to what curly braces were (""Where's the endif? VBScript has endifs! And what are those silly {} things for?""). I finally got into PHP around middle school early high school when I wrote a really primitive webcomic system for a friend, modeled after megatokyo. Full of SQL injection holes, though I started to figure out and create my own OOP-ish system.<p>Later: Python (Pylons), PostgreSQL, Java Servlets, Jersey, Play Framework, Jackson (in roughly that order, omitting a lot of detail).<p>Only ever had a mentor who taught me new things once, when learning the servlets stuff. The rest of the time, I had no mentorship :(.",1333407515

It's interesting, but it's not fun and can be totally counter intuitive, thus there is no ""fun"" way to demonstrate it.</i><p>I couldn't disagree more. As an example, linear algebra is something that has been bothering me for years, long after my college math courses. One of its central topics is eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Every textbook I can remember would demonstrate these with pictures of a sheared rectangle (or a sheared box in 3d). That's fine, but it isn't fun and its not motivating, so no surprise that the concept never clicked.<p>Then very recently, while browsing wikipedia I came across an excellent demonstration of the concept: ""eigenfaces"" used in facial recognition software. Its fun, useful, and it clicked.<p>> <i>how do you demonstrate that the ensemble of invertible matrix is dense in the set of R(n,n) matrix in a visual manner?</i><p>You could draw a picture of a circle, emphasizing the line of the circle as the boundary of the set. The invertible matrices are the interior of the circle, and they complement the singular (non-invertible) matrices which are represented by the boundary of the circle.<p>But more importantly, the teacher should first explain why this might be useful to know in the most concrete way possible, whether its theory behind an applied technique in engineering or a lemma used for an important abstract theorem (no handwaving - tell what's important or significant about the abstract theorem).<p>It is the teacher's job to motivate the students, good ones do so and bad ones don't. Lazy teachers who don't think its their job to motivate students will get exactly what they complain about: unmotivated students.<p>Students (American or otherwise) who are willing to just put their heads down and drill rote symbol manipulation are doing themselves a disservice - it generally does not lead to much insight or understanding of what they are doing (though it may in the exceptional cases of very smart students), especially as the math gets more advanced. Moreover, being adept at calculating is not useful in the age of computers. You only need to do a calculation once (as an algorithm in a computer program).<p>More important is to gain insight and understanding into the nature and limitations of the subject matter. Then the student is more likely to recognize the cases where it can be applied after they're done with the plug-and-chug problem sets at the end of the chapter (which plague even advanced math textbooks in the form of boilerplate theorem proofs). Of course, simply showing how to plug-and-chug is easier for teachers so they praise obedient students who are easily motivates and ask easy questions.",1333405209

3790328,comment,3785672,3788353,1,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"1) I am not because of what you said - it's tough, more so from a data architecture standpoint (set up the accounts, data scrapes, etc.). Also, at 8 million USD 30-day dollar volume on MtGox, I'm not sure if there's enough depth yet to make it worth it (still toying with the idea, though).<p>A currency's value isn't a function of how much of it is outstanding but how much is transacted in it. If ""most bitcoins are held by...people"" holding on speculation, they contribute to holding its value down (don't think of stocks with dividends, think of fx). They also make the market smaller and less liquid.<p>2) The quote cycling HF market making algos use to discover prices disappears in a liquid market. If done in penny stocks, on the other hand, it would scare the hell out of everyone when a market order executes against a discovery bid way out on Pluto.<p>When these slips happen the HF guys get hurt - that's why they pull their servers causing the liquidity cuts they're criticised for. Thus, they work to predict when that kind of slip-up will happen. I'm reversing the logic and saying I'll force the slip-up and take advantage of the volatility right after, something with uncertain pay-off in liquid markets (you burn yourself in spawning the unstable equilibria) but more definite pay-off in illiquid ones.<p>Note that I wouldn't recommend trading Bitcoins at a high frequency for the same reason that HFs don't mess with penny stocks. The pay-off is too low compared with the infrastructure investment required. I'd probably also blow my cover with the exchanges.<p>Hope that answers your question!",1333404424

I've been leaning towards launching a retail arm in our one EU country, and launching 3 new wholesale websites translated into Dutch, French, and whatever they speak in Belgium.<p>We decided instead to translate just the landing page 3 times into 3 languages, to set up a retail site landing page, and to run 4 Google ad campaigns for a couple of weeks, dropping a couple of hundred euro on each one - to see what happens... impressions, clicks, etc.<p>Here's he point. On HN, we hear non-stop about MVPs, and because of the site that's in it, it's all software or web services.

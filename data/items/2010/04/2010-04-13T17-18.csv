Imagine, what Dijkstra will have to say about “a lang designed for ‘hacker’?” LOL.<p>That was a pathetic criticism of pg's ""infatuation with the concept of hacker"".<p>But I do agree that educators should not be spreading the myth of ""the hacker"".  I see people who solve far complex problem than I face in my job, people who can store immense amount of information in their head, people who can abstract out the details from a problem, model complicated real life problems on paper struggle to solve their problems using a computer. Is it because of the tools that we give them? Is it because of some kind of cognitive dissonance? Is it a totally different mental model than they have been accustomed to? What would be the basic skills to become a good programmer? How do you develop interest and skills to solve more complicated computation problems using them? How do we make people appreciate the immense power of computers and the abstraction layers that we have to solve problems?<p>I do not know the answers to these questions. But I strongly believe that spreading this myth of a hacker, who are almost born with these magical skills,is not helping. Everybody should program computers. Everybody can program them.",1271181518

I recently read a book that claimed inflation is more like 6 or 7% - for the things that matter.<p>The government decides what goods to put into the ""standard basket"" to calculate the inflation. They can choose goods that make inflation numbers seem good.<p>Yes I know it is usually not 10% (although we might still be in the middle of an economic crisis - Greece, one of the Euro countries, just going bankrupt). I am not sure if a typical salary raise is 10%, either. I am pretty sure that with salary raises alone, you won't be making significant headway as an employee (your company won't upgrade you from 50K/year to 100K/year). The only way to earn more is typically to switch jobs.<p>I never had a contract that said ""salary will be raised by 10% every year"", it was just a number I took out of thin air.",1271181477

Also there might be family to support.<p>So to survive for a year, I would need 24K of savings. It takes several years to build that up with a normal salary.<p>To pay for a house or flat, most people work 30 years where I live. And that is with 50K they pay in cash in the beginning - which I don't have, as I don't have rich parents. It takes several years to save 50K with a normal salary. I haven't worked as an employee for a while, but there are taxes to be paid, social insurance, pension plans and what not (mandatory where I live). I think with 60K, maybe < 10K would be left over per year. That's not counting iPads, new Computers, car, whatever (meaning I won't be able to save all that). Also, the pension plan is supposed to be worthless (they've been saying for years that the system will collapse), so I'd have to put some money into a private pension plan.<p>As a freelancer, I was up to 80K savings in about 3 years (sadly, since then severely reduced, but still).<p>Yes, you can live comfortably as an employee - as long as you don't lose your job for 40 years.",1271181245

By this definition the obsessive ""organic"" or ""local food"" types are just as boringly consumerist as any Manolo-obsessed bar skank or the douchebag driving the BMW he can't really afford. Anti-consumerism is a form of consumerism just as mind-dulling as consumerism itself.<p>I am forced by geography to shop at a rather hippieish supermarket in Berkeley (the Berkeley Bowl) where I always pity those fellow shoppers who have nothing more interesting to think about than how to optimise the organicness of their purchases in order to increase their own self-image.

The fact that credit exists smooths out the ups and downs in revenues is a good thing.</i><p>My comment wasn't related to this, but you're missing a big difference.  If a business doesn't get there finances straightened out, they go under.  If a business is wasting their money on stupid consulting projects causing their prices to rise, you can stop buying their products.  You can't do that with the government.<p><i>Imagine the long-term cost of winding down government services, just to have to wind them up again? There are huge ramping costs to take into consideration, not to mention the impact on the economy. While I agree that government spending is a little ridiculous at times, breaking it down into simplistic terms ignores the vast tasks that even a stripped down federal government must undertake.</i><p>You're assuming that it's desirable to ramp them back up.  I am totally comfortable doing away with Social Security and Medicare, lowering defense spending back to $3599 from $6071, drastically cutting anti-poverty programs so that everyone has to work to survive, and using the surpluses created by those reductions to pay down the federal debt to eliminate the interest expense.  I'd also be for moving the Education and Mass Transit taxes back to the states so a bunch of stupid restrictions don't have to be met, like the 65mph speed limit and No Child Left Behind.  While at it, we should drastically reduce our health research funding since the US represents 81% of global health R&D spending, and eliminate future federal employee retirement benefits.  The mortgage credits can take a hike as well.<p><i>Also, because of the way most people spend money in reality, the government would go broke if they tried to collect taxes without witholding. Sad but true.</i><p>That's a feature, not a bug.

1262733,comment,1261777,1262492,0,0,plesn,,,"First point (""consumerism vs. repressive cultures""): reread my post, don't do amalgams. I fail to see the correlation between proponents of ""authenticity"" and dictator regimes. First, in the article authenticity proponents are pictured as ""anti-globalization"" activists: I rarely see vegetarians as mostly concerned by marxism. Moreover it is questionnable to correlate dictator regimes with Marxism: many south-amercian or african regimes are/were backed by the US/France/etc... Finally, Marxism was mostly productivist (except Lafargue), non-decentralised (you don't have to go to Lenin and Trotsky taking over the Soviets, you already see it in the argument between Marx and Bakounin), and moreover its analysis did not insist on differentiating financial and industrial capital, which is important to understand the current crisis. All in all, as I was saying, the media industry frames all opposition as ""repressive"" and ""brutal"" and makes it diffult to find alternatives: hopefully people everywhere are creative in actions and thoughts.<p>Second point: I was not formulating a binary centralized vs decentralized debate where transporting food is not allowed or we go back to the Middle-Age; I'm just saying that there is a need for more autonomy in the system to prevent crises like recent ones (e.g. the rice crisis in 2008). It's just common sense to say that third world countries with more food-producing agriculture (instead of say, cotton) are less fragile to speculation on food which can lead to disasters especially in bad years, or that controlling their crops vs using GMO's makes them less economically dependent on big corporations.",1271180316

(The same is true of rent control, since a lot of RC people now live out of the city but keep the apartment because it's cheaper than staying at a hotel for 2-3 weeks.)<p>Finally, the underemployed and parentally funded (trust fund kids) should not be allowed to drive up the rents.

My apologies.)<p>If you're only using a small fraction of the total capacity, chances are you won't see much performance degradation for a long while no matter how much you write to the drive because of minimal fragmentation at the block level. But given enough time, you'd still hit that wall at some point.<p>But if you're using a large fraction of the total capacity, then you're going to have much more fragmentation, which means pages that can't be erased without having to rewrite significant numbers of blocks in those pages. Those ephemeral writes will start taking a real performance hit.<p>Many newer SSDs now include logic in their controllers to help mitigate this problem, with varying degrees of success. But full TRIM support on the drive and in the OS make a significantly larger difference than anything done by the drive alone. (Even with TRIM, though, the problem doesn't go away completely.)<p>And this isn't just some kind of spin from Anandtech--TRIM exists for a reason. It's a well-tested property of MLC SSDs. The combination of wear leveling and write combining can cause serious performance issues without TRIM.

I can live fairly happily without dual head for coding, but I find netbooks' screen/keyboard/slowness unbearable.<p>My laptop has enough power for my day to day needs (running web browsers, dev IDE, mail, and not taking forever to compile large tex docs), and for my larger needs, well, I need a 32GB RAM server for those, so I wouldn't have a desktop that could handle them either :-).  Unless I'm really caning it, it doesn't make a sound, and all I have to do to turn it into a workstation is plug in a USB hub and monitor - not exactly a chore.<p>In terms of portability, my macbook is light enough for me to easily carry around, and in practise I get around 5-6 hours battery life even after a year's usage.  If I upgraded to a newer macbook (I have one with a removable battery), I'd get closer to 10.<p>I completely agree about not buying a bad laptop.  I have no interest in lugging around a behemoth that gets two hours battery life, or one that trades weight for being too slow for my everyday needs.  A good laptop (and I'm not <i>just</i> talking about macs here, although I've had extremely positive experiences with mine) is powerful, light, and has good battery life.

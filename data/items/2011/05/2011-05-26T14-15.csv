And you're right -- if the value of a Bitcoin is expected to keep trending up, that shouldn't be a problem. But what happens if (or, as I'm guessing, <i>when</i>) the market adjusts, or the bubble pops? That decentralized nature makes me worry that any investment in Bitcoins could turn very illiquid <i>very</i> fast, and given that the market right now seems to be driven almost completely by speculation, I worry about this happening sooner than later.<p>If, however, more people start accepting Bitcoins in exchange for goods & services, I think the currency might stabilize a bit more. But that's going to require much more widespread adoption. And how many merchants will shy away from a currency whose value can swing 10%-15% in the time it takes a customer to place an order?<p>The one and only thing I feel certain about re. Bitcoin: Somebody <i>way smarter</i> than me is going to make a ton of money with this.",1306421975
2587948,comment,2585061,2586268,1,0,ctdonath,,,"Sometimes there's a point to the snark, which is missed by the downvoters.<p>There's more to an index than ""hey, let's share an index"". That's WHY we have multiple search engines: there will be differing views of what should be in that shared index, and how it should be constructed to facilitate varying needs. There are multiple search engines because each one plays off ""hey, our index is better than theirs"".<p>My snark makes the point: why not just have a single distributed/copied/shared library system, and do away with pricy competition? Answer: because that single system does not provide everything everyone wants, and people are willing to pay for a different selection & service.<p>The search engine and index are tightly coupled. They're huge, they're complex, they're expensive - and people think they can make a good buck by somehow doing it different. Create a ""universal index"", and someone will realize they can make money by making their own, leading right back to what we have today.<p>The TFA's key issue isn't really that multiple indexes are crawling his website, it's that they're gathering his data thru the most inefficient means possible - polling every page as often as practical. You don't want universal index, because short of banning competing indexes there will always be competing indexes. You want an agreed-on search interface: a means to serve the indexes what they want at a cost lower than what it costs them to poll-mine your site.<p>Yeah, a universal index is a bad idea. It ignores the fact (you'd think visitors to ycombinator of all sites would get this) that there is money in competition, ergo there will never be a single index. That, and it still doesn't solve the problem: it may reduce the number of crawlers sucking your bandwidth, but it's still polling every page as fast and often as it can.",1306421972

Probably won't but I at least wanted to give a mini-pitch, which I was told not to do on stage.<p>Flytivity is less like Sonar in that frequent flyers will share their travel itinerary before they travel, through the portal or most likely through TripIt.  Flytivity pushes profiles of other business people that they might want to connect with in the airport, at the conference or traveling to that city via email the day before you travel;  from there they can see how their connected (via linkedin (1st, 2nd 3rd level) or twitter) as well as other commonalities they might have with someone totally unconnected.  You will also be able to initiate direct message right from the email.<p>Within the app the user can build a trip, check out who they might meet on future trips, see who's in town on a current trip as well as post in the city/conference forum about events.<p>With 460 million business trips on the books for this year, Flytivity was created with the business class traveler in mind.  We know status and upgrades are important.  We know you don't want to talk to just anyone, which is why you talk to no one.  We also know that one face to face meeting can grow your business or career.  We want to help make that happen.",1306421911

I mean, we don't criticise jobs for missing the enterprise software market.<p>Apple is a very focused company that competes in a few select markets (rare for tech giants). Enterprise is not one of them. You can't criticize Steve Jobs for not succeeding in the enterprise market any more than you can criticize him for not succeeding in the search engine/online advertising market. Enterprise has never been a core part of their business.<p>Microsoft has been trying, and failing, for 10 years to create a market for their tablets. Another company created that market. It's been 18 months since the iPad was announced. Google, RIM, and HP all have operating systems appropriate to compete in the tablet market. Microsoft still has nothing.<p>Ballmer mocked the iPhone when it was introduced. Apparently he genuinely believed what he was saying, because instead of mocking the iPhone publicly but scrambling to bring Windows Mobile up to what would clearly be the new standard for smartphones, he let three years pass before Microsoft released a credible competitor. Meanwhile the smartphone industry exploded and as of now is dominated by other companies.<p>In these two crucial markets that are part of Microsoft's <i>core business</i>, Microsoft has been incompetent.

How would you feel if the most hardened violent criminals came to power in the US, and arranged to have these properties turned over to private owners, to run for their benefit (or to pillage and destroy, as was the fate of most Soviet industry) ?<p>One can debate the practical merits of planned economies all day long but this does not change the fact that <i>privatization is theft.</i> The former owners of Soviet facilities - the Soviet people - were not adequately compensated for their loss.  It is highly doubtful that fair compensation for the privatization of public property is possible <i>even in principle.</i>  Do you dole out homeopathic-sized shares of stock? (Criminals buy them back for pennies-on-the-dollar from the masses in lean times - or at gunpoint...) What do you issue to the not-yet-born citizens who will no longer be heir to the means of production?

I don't think Ebert's it's meant to be scientfic, nor is his article primarily about economics. I saw it as more of a love letter, which is very personal, very subjective. His last paragraph:<p>""I despair. This is a case of Hollywood selling its birthright for a message of pottage. If as much attention were paid to exhibition as to marketing, that would be an investment in the future. People would fall back in love with the movies. Short-sighted, technically illiterate penny-pinchers are wounding a great art form.""<p>The primary purpose of the article isn't to explain the potential economic impact of the degradation in projection quality, or to provide scientific proof that the majority of people are affected. It's to say that movies look shittier, and to explain why - and to express how sad it makes him that movies are looking so shitty. I saw the remark about how people would be less likely to return to theaters as more of an expression of his unhappiness than as the central point of his article.<p>Personally, I found the article very helpful. I saw Thor opening weekend, and I was confused about why it looked so dim. It was disappointing to me to view something so graphically rich in a way that made it look it was 50 years old and faded.

I was a freelancer and I realized that we guys spend a lot of time looking for work on different platforms - which could be saved if a technology could bring those jobs to us instead of us going out looking for them. That's how Grep42 was born. I built the product and shared it with you and received a lot of suggestions and support for which I'm very thankful.<p>However, I've now run into a thought-block. The analytics haven't improved and I get a lot of 1 time visits.
I've added most of the stuff you guys requested but somehow you're still not finding it very usable - and I'm dumbfounded. A request to all freelancers here, please try it out and tell me what can I do to help you. If you feel this is useless garbage, I'll throw it away. If you feel you would be willing to bet your dollar on this, I would appreciate that with the same amount of grace. So help me, help you. Your 2 cents are appreciated.<p>Some questions you could ask yourself:<p>- As a freelancer, what are the 5 most nagging problems? (technical or non-technical, more personal the better. ""no fixed hours"" qualifies as a valid problem)<p>- What are your favorite sites that you use to search for projects?<p>- Do you get direct referrals? Is there something I can do to make that better?<p>I look forward to your answers, thanks!<p>Jagtesh<p>jagtesh A.T gmail D.O.T com",1306419868

Then I came across this article, or one similar, and messed around with different fonts and sizes. The difference it made was surprising. I feel like it definitely has made an improvement in how I work.
I would recommend people try testing new fonts, layouts, etc at least once a year. the aesthetics is just as important as the content, even when coding.",1306418701

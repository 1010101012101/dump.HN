Just finding an activity or practice where you can quiet your mind is absolutely essential.

I still get spam in there.  And incremental costs are so minimal to spammers, that why would they bother?  That's kind of the whole reason spam works despite microscopic conversion rates.<p>I also doubt that google shares their anti-spam tech or reports with other mail providers.  Each company wants to keep their proprietary stuff secret, and anti-spam tends to have a bit of secret sauce.  Now, say google, microsoft, and yahoo got together and shared reputation information, you might see spammers start to avoid those systems (at least from their main botnets) in an effort to not hurt their ""reputation"".<p>By and large, though, I just think they are willing to spam any address that they think has a small chance of getting to a person.  Frequently they're run by bot nets at such small incremental costs.  There's no compelling reason for them to do this.<p>FWIW, using the Pivotal Veracity / Returnpath tools (which estimate delivery rates by using seedlists), I've found that MSN is much more likely to mark something as spam, compared with gmail.

They both offer roughly the same thing, but when it comes to taking something live and handling significant traffic, I find it's easier to go out of the box with Django.  That is, when the plain vanilla is no longer sufficient, Rails, as a matter of course, fights you.  I appreciate the ""we know better"" paradigm that it operates under because it can teach and enforce some pretty good practices.  Although I speak only for myself, I've had many conversations with some very experienced folks, and I've felt like we were on the same page.<p>Also: if you're already comfortable with Cake, the jump to Rails is probably quite short.  I'll bet you become very productive on it very quickly.<p>The Python job market in New York is hot, and Django is very popular.  I don't see too much other than Rails opportunities for those that bring Ruby knowledge, but there is certainly enough Rails work to keep you busy.  The upside is that there are lots of CMS and infrastructure stuff that is Ruby based, but they tend to be products in their own right rather than tools to hack on.  In my opinion, Rails carries Ruby in the market.  Without Rails, Ruby would probably fade back into relative obscurity.",1288025333

These types of poisoning are very useful, but they're not what you need for Firesheep. With a poisoning attack, you override the packet's destination and it's up to you to send (it's an active attack). Firesheep just monitors passively, which is why I was wondering if it worked anywhere.<p>I agree with you, I'm just saying that the type of passive monitoring Firesheep does only works on unsecured wifi networks and is, thus, not very useful.",1288025033

There's a lot an attacker can do such as fake authentication with the server to force it send more of the necessary packets, etc.<p>WPA on the other hand cannot be broken like this. WPA is broken by capturing the handshake between the router and a user. This handshake can then be brute forced with a dictionary. The reason it's so difficult to crack is because the encryption key is salted with the essid of the router making rainbow tables extremely difficult to pre-compute. However, if the user uses a standard essid that came with the router, then pre-computed rainbow tables can most likely be found for it. They can be computed though while capturing the handshake, and I find it's beneficial to create the rainbow tables if you have a large dictionary.<p>Take a look at aircrack-ng for a lot more detail.

I have experience with databases, websites and authentication and I could realistically scale the technology to a private beta phase... beyond that, having someone experienced on the deploy side would be incredibly useful. How do new startups deal with this?<p>ps: If you're an HNer in/around London (England) with strong Flash (AS3) skills, taken a web 2.0 from prototype to public beta, (massive bonus if you can do iPhone apps), and keen to get involved in an innovative concept, please do get in touch!",1288024592

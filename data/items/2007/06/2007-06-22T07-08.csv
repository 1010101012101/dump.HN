For each user, history (past intentions) allows a simple metric, <i>'karma/created'</i> to base any decision on. That and the fact <i>'double clicks'</i>, <i>'easter eggs'</i>  are a windows paradigm & the user is a cheeky <i>'Kiwi'</i> ",1182498163

At least you could read it (technically it works) but the result would (without some clever hackery) look crap. <p>Maybe a better way would simply extract the text & rebuild a page in a standard format?  <p><i>""...

Thats the problem. It's not having a site of just friends it's about being able to re-build your social network on new sites at a level above. A means to independently store, record & modify your own network not relying on the clumsy & ill-conceived tools that new sites pass for adding existing friends.<p>You would think that companies would try to improve this. Doing it right could mean the difference between so-so and good membership sign-ups.",1182496165

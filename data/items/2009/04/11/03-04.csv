It occurs to me a person could do some sort of git style display.  Anything that's over 5 seconds old is revision 1, and if you edit that later, you see the old crossed out, and the new highlighted.  (this would be a mode that could be turned on/off as desired, as it could be distracting)  Such a mode would allow a window into the thought processes of the writer, both for the voyeurs, and for the writer himself.",1239421961

If I were your congressman, I would support the bill ;).<p>But if you think the U.S. is already tapped out of top entrepreneurs, your not looking hard enough.<p>What would the costs be to enable those already in America?  Things like school loan deferment and establishing incubation investment vehicles in at least 10 other cities could enable at least 10,000 Americans.  Sure that costs something.  But if you think it would be cheap to oversee a special program for 10,000 ""entrepreneur visas"" a year, then you haven't spent much time at immigration offices ;).",1239421376

557183,comment,556908,556908,0,0,kalendae,,,"What about the opposite question.  Do startups need to be in the US to be successful?  And if so why?  I'm sure there are non-US originated webapps that are popular in the US, but it seems the opposite tends to happen more often (Google, Facebook, etc etc...).  Given that you can host your web app on EC2 from anywhere in the world with an internet connection as easily as from the US, what then are the barriers?  My guess is that it is actually mostly cultural.  If I write a webapp I am more comfortable knowing the target audience well.  If it is a cultural barrier, then maybe the foreign founders don't really gain much from being in the US unless they are here to absorb the culture?",1239419997

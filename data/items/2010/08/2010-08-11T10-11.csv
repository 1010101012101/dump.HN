1594356,comment,1594054,1594054,0,0,Tycho,,,"Yeah they are... They give away much more money through taxation (which the article/study doesn't seem to consider. For instance, asking 'If you earned $500 000 a year and lost 40% of it through tax, how much additional wealth should you give away voluntarily,' is different from asking 'what percentage of your income should you keep/lose?' Perhaps one believes all people should keep the same portion of their income, and answered that lower income people should give more to charity in order to compensate for their lower taxation. The study misses this and the article concludes 'rich people think poor people should give more.' It's also an easy explanation for why even when hypothetically adopting a different income bracket, their attitudes 'changed').",1281524016

1594353,comment,1592428,1593888,0,0,dhimes,,,"I don't know the history of mathematical theories, but in physics it has often been the case that something took years (or decades) for people to wrap their heads around as they were poking at the edges of understanding.  But as they continued to do so, new ideas and concepts emerged which made a better mental framework for understanding them.  Hence, for example, the work-energy theorem can now be proved by a high school senior, but in the day there was big debate over the factor of 1/2 in the term for kinetic energy.<p>So it may be with mathematics.  Things like Fermat's Last Theorem and P != NP may be difficult to grasp simply within our current frameworks, but new ideas may give rise to new frameworks that makes them more digestible.<p>If you can just get it proved <i>somehow</i> then you can proceed with confidence towards these new ideas.",1281523781

Git branches with rebase and amend for commits are like mercurial patch queues on steroids.<p>At Astrails we used mercurial for a couple of years with quite an elaborate workflow involving <i>shared</i> patch queues which were in their own mercurial repository.<p>Once we switched to git I tried for a while to force similar workflow on git. I investigated stgit, quilt etc to try to use patch queues with it. Nothing quite worked so we kept just using the regular git with topic branches and once I learned all the 'magic' git stuff like ""commit --amend"" and ""rebase -i"" I realized I no longer needed patch queues.

The OS kernel does time-slicing if N > M, and this bites you because context-switching between threads is costly, and the more threads you have, the more context-switching the kernel needs to make.<p>On the other hand, with a server on top of the JVM you can get to a couple of thousands reqs/second without async I/O. The app I'm working on right now reaches ~ 2000 reqs/second.<p>Even if some web app does 500 requests / second, who needs more than that? Google? Twitter? Most apps don't.<p>Of course, in the context of Rails ... performance has always been shitty, and I can't blame people for searching silver bullets.

Along a similar vein, the french group of mathematitions who published together under the pseudonym N. Bourbaki laid down a huge amount of mathematics in the 1930s. Their work became the foundation for much of the rigorous mathematics of the last century.<p>Of course, no-one ends up with a famous theorem under their name as no one person can claim they proved the theorem. But from the point of view of the mathematics world, it seems like a great idea.",1281521900

As the article notes, memes are increasingly where we get our culture. And hoaxes are an integral part of the meme landscape.<p>Anyone who can find a way to modify the Internet (not the Internet itself, of course, but people's use of the Internet) to better resist the spread of hoaxes could significantly change society. Think not just hoaxes, but outrages like #amazonfail. What a huge social cost (on attention, reputation etc)  these things impose. <a href=""http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/04/the-failure-of-amazonfail/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/04/the-failure-of-amazonfa...</a><p>Now that might not seem like a great startup idea -- users are just having fun spreading links around (or getting outraged), and if you can't even monetize content then how can you monetize crowdsourcing the truth?<p>But then I noticed that Fox News and other media outlets fell for this hoax. Surely there's a significant monetary cost to that, which provides an opportunity for a business model?<p>The old Snopes way of doing things isn't working so well any more -- these things spread in <i>minutes</i>, so the fact checking mechanism needs to use channels similar to the ones that the hoaxes themselves do.<p>One possible idea is a prediction market (that pays out real money). If it is successful, it might become a standard part of media fact checking policy to check the prices there. A news organization probably be willing to actually wager a few thousand dollars -- a fraction of what the story is worth to them. Coming back to this example, that would give a tremendous incentive to one of the many people involved in creating this hoax to make a decent pile of money through the prediction site (anonymously, in fact). In effect, it would be a way for anonymous tipsters to leak out the word (in addition to aggregating third-party analysis and intelligence), except it would be far more streamlined and effective because it's a market.<p>Anyway, just a thought.",1281521866

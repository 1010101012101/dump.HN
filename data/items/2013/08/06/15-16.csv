A private interest should not have the right to do so.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s not the private interest who condemns the prisoner, but they run these facilities at a profit, turning what should be a rehabilitating environment into an environment that is designed to promote full prisons to enrich an individual.<p>A good prison should work at a financial loss because there should be a societal benefit to rehabilitating inmates.  If a higher prison population turns into a financial incentive, there is no incentive to help inmates or even reduce recidivism.<p>This is especially true when you consider how many minor offenses can send people to jail in the US. It is also interesting to consider that when slavery was abolished, many plantations turned into for-profit prisons; or that the incarceration rate of the US is the highest in the world.",1375804704

You&#x27;re claiming that the same novice who can&#x27;t install a simple application or or follow three steps to reveal a password on the page will be capable of drilling down through the Chrome settings menus and displaying passwords. The corollary to your claim is that the threat of this novice outweighs the damage of encouraging people to leave their computers unlocked in a potentially hostile environment.<p>Drawing equivalence to sites that email your password is also misguided. The issue with those sites is that, contrary to a password manager, they have no reason to ever retain the cleartext password. And more fundamentally, there&#x27;s no excuse to ever transmit credentials in the clear over a network. Whereas in this case, we&#x27;re talking about showing the user passwords that must be retained in a recoverable form, displaying only on user request, and within a security context that can trivially access them anyway.<p>At this point I think I&#x27;ve repeatedly conveyed the reasons for Chrome&#x27;s design decisions on this front.

6167256,comment,6165711,6165711,3,0,tptacek,,,"This is a confused and confusing article.<p>The &quot;streaming&quot; to which it refers could mean any of a number of different things depending on the context you choose to read it in. Those contexts include:<p>(a) &quot;Streaming&quot; as laypersons define it; literally viewing unauthorized streaming content from a service like Youtube.<p>(b) &quot;Streaming&quot; in the SOPA analysis, as Zittrain and (unfortunately) Techdirt are discussing in the article linked from this WaPo post.<p>(c) &quot;Streaming&quot; in the Klobuchar bill, which makes a very specific change to copyright law that isn&#x27;t nearly as sweeping as SOPA.<p>(d) &quot;Streaming&quot; as described in the Commerce report.<p>I assume the WaPo is referring to (c) or (d), since that&#x27;s the interpretation that squares with the headline. But then why is it talking about Justin Bieber and SOPA?<p>Specifically: the Klobuchar bill closes a loophole in the copyright law that results from streaming being classified as &quot;public performance&quot; and not &quot;distribution&quot;. Like other criminal infringement statutes, it requires the infringement to be commercial in nature to be prosecutable --- you have to build a business on your unauthorized streaming to have committed a felony. Unlike (as I understand it) SOPA, the Bieber Youtube upload would not be a crime in the Klobuchar bill.<p>The Commerce report doesn&#x27;t even advocate for Klobuchar; it merely recognizes the loophole in the law, which obviously does exist: you can build a Pirate iTunes Music Store and be charged with a felony, but build a Pirate Netflix and it&#x27;s a misdemeanor. That is, in fact, a weird legal result.<p>Finally, Bieber&#x27;s opinion about his fans uploading unauthorized copies of his work is probably not relevant. Bieber sold his commercial interest in those works to recording companies, for spectacular amounts of money. It&#x27;s easy for him to advocate for his fans right to traffic in unauthorized copies of his tracks; they&#x27;re not his property anymore, and infringement is someone else&#x27;s problem.",1375804133

[1] [2]<p>So the theory <i>assumes</i> the press is irrational (e.g. writing nonsense articles about Apple that are completely divorced from business reality) but then supposes you can avoid their gaze, by relying on them to act rationally according to rules you perceive. (e.g. they will not chatter about you, if you don&#x27;t make too much profit too quickly)<p>Lost in any of this, is any measure of <i>whether it actually matters</i> one whit whether traders, analysts or journalists use emotional manipulation of the larger public to create business opportunities for themselves.<p>[1] Traders exist to trade. Mismatch between perceived value and price creates profit. If there is no mismatch, they create some. See: Jim Cramer<p>[2] The press exists to sell newspapers.  Controversy creates profit.

I&#x27;m using my local repo, and I decide that it would be a good idea to push to the shared repo on github.<p>Oh, it&#x27;s down.<p>Never mind, I&#x27;ll carry on with the next bug-to-fix/feature-to-add.<p>What is it that people are doing that requires github to be up, otherwise at that moment they can&#x27;t work and have to wait?<p>I feel like I&#x27;m asking a question that makes sense to me, and yet people are staring back blankly, unable to comprehend the question.

I&#x27;m getting downvoted.<p>Pretty soon I&#x27;ll go away without having learned something from the people who clearly have the knowledge, but can&#x27;t understand my ignorance.<p>I wonder if this is born of the fact that I always arrange my workflow so as not to require any external services at any specific time.  In part, this is a result of getting into computing at a time when remote services were inherently unstable.  Perhaps times have changed enough that people assume remote services will always be up, and then when they aren&#x27;t, everything <i>has</i> to stop, because their workflow is predicated on availability.<p>This is like programming an API querying system that just assumes the remote server won&#x27;t hang.

But that doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t also make an effort avoid language which might upset people.</i><p>Well, I&#x27;ll take any effort needed to avoid language that might upset people -- except the kind of people that are upset by language.<p>Those I&#x27;ll take any effort needed to upset them.<p>I mean, I would not use words that might hurt a regular person or somebody who is actually sensitive to them because of their state/past/gender/color/etc.<p>But I would very much use all the words that annoy the kind of people who get annoyed by words all the time, ie. the PC crowd.

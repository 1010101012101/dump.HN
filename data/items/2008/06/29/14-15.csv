However...<p>> 1) Several options...<p>One of the nice things about the help in emacs is that, when installed with source, function/variable lookup allows you to jump directly to the implementation from the help page, modify the code, and have the new implementation running in-line.  This is useful for both one-off changes to built-ins (just re-evaluate the function), and for immediately fixing bugs in your own scripts as you find them.<p>> 4) When I first read about this, I was immediately interested. For similar functionality (couldn't claim whether or not it was the SAME, strictly, as I don't actually use Emacs)...<p>Emacs's kill-ring and mark-ring are actually two separate things--the kill-ring is as you described, while the mark-ring is akin to having a web-browser's ""back"" button while editing text (e.g., edit some text in a function at the bottom of a file, jump to a separate function, edit some text; typing C-u C-space will then jump back to the original function).<p>> 6) Sad to say I'm at a loss here -- not to say vim couldn't do this, but rather I've never needed to do this in my range of experiences...<p>At work we have some servers which have only basic unix commands on them (they're also on a separate floor); it's much nicer to be able to edit files on my workstation using tramp (with vim, there's equivalent functionality, e.g. ftp://user:pass@hostname/path/to/file) than to deal with uploading/downloading files and trying to determine whether the server/my client has the more recent changes.",1214751009

I host stuff in my own datacenter, I don't overly promote it here, although I had considered a YC special rate.  Or is it that I shouldn't promote my startup because it's not free?

231189,comment,231040,231040,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I believe another flaw of this article is that $100,000 is considered wealthy. My family's household income is above this but my dad provides for a family of 6, children. Of course he spends most of his time working.<p>I'd like to see a study done on people either who have a high net worth (like qaexl said) of say over $1,000,000 not including their primary residence. Then we could see what they do with the money they already have. Either that or people who have an income of over $250,000.<p>The issue with the study is that there are a ton of middle class people making over $100,000, but not many who can build it up, compared with the relatively few people with much higher actual net worths. The problem is that these two categories get counted together, and those barely breaking 6 figures vastly outweigh the others.<p>The other thing to consider is that those who are significantly well off may tend to enjoy pushing themselves (which is how they got their in the first place). PG doesn't have to do YCombinator. I'm sure Viaweb set him up for life. He probably just enjoys the industry and prefers to spend his time productively, just like many other wealthy people.",1214749426
231188,comment,231168,231168,0,0,aneesh,,,"So, a couple people asked for an explanation, so here goes:<p>t_s basically serves as ""gravity"" to make older posts fall down the page.  Why Dec 8, 2005?  Maybe that's when they launched.  Anyway, what t_s does in the function is equate a 10-fold increase in points with being submitted 12.5 hours (that's 45,000 secs) later.  So a 1-hour-old post would have to improve its vote differential 10x over the next 12.5 hours to maintain it's rating to compensate for elapsed time.  If a post's vote differential increases more than 10x in 12.5 hours, its rating goes up.<p>As for where the numbers come from, I'm pretty sure they're tuned by trial-and-error.  It's really hard to predict voting patterns beforehand (ie how fast should items ""fall"" from the main page?)<p>The log function is there because your first 10 upvotes should have more weight than the 101st to 110th upvotes.  The way the formula is written (and assuming 0 downvotes), your first 10 upvotes have the same weight as the next 100 upvotes, which have the same weight as the next 1000, etc.  Again, the base of the logarithm is somewhat arbitrary, and can be tuned by trial and error.<p>And needless to say, if you have more downvotes than upvotes, your rating is negative.  That's about it.<p>(note: I'm just reading the page and interpreting the algorithm - I don't have any special insight into how they chose these particular constants)<p>Edit:  Time since Dec 8, 2005 is an elegant way of doing it.  My first (crude) thought would've been to use ""time since posting"" to determine gravity, but that requires keeping track of what time it is now.  This method is completely independent of the current time.  So nicely done.",1214749328

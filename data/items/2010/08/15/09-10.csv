1604872,comment,1604612,1604769,0,0,igravious,,,"I remember when Linux was trying to get validation in the enterprise space and Oracle porting their DB wares to Linux accomplished this almost single-handedly over night. (This was circa '99, 2000, don't remember exactly.) I want to stress that the geeks had already known that Linux was ready on the server-side by this time but now we had a nice talking to convince the suits, ""Oracle takes Linux seriously"". I have always thought that Oracle has not been antagonistic to Linux because Oracle is not an OS shop whereas, for instance, Microsoft _is_ so Oracle's core business has not been in danger. IBM made sure to differentiate AIX away from Linux and definitely grokked Linux before Oracle. SUN never could give up on Solaris and now we have Oracle Solaris so we'll have to see how that fares.<p>I wouldn't say that Oracle has been open source unfriendly, witness as somebody else has said BTRFS. It would be sanguine to say that Oracle like other large corps behaves hot and cold towards free and open source software depending on who in the company is doing the talking.<p>Also as others have pointed out, Oracle seems to have had (up until this point at least) an admirable stance on software patents as far as I can tell, issuing public statements on patent reform.<p><i>However</i> Google (rightly or wrongly) is seen as very open source friendly. This is doubtless due to Chris Di Bona and their summer of code thing and noticeably employing a lot of people to work on Linux and open source stuff. Android is way freer than Apple's IOS and Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 and RIM's offerings. (Nokia has opened Symbian and Meego is open but they are not considered relevant at the moment.) So Oracle suing Google over Android is going to be seen as open source unfriendly regardless of the legality of the patent lawsuit. Surely, all this could be cleared up without recourse to lawsuits?<p>I think taking sides in this is silly. The law (however crappy) is the law. Yes, software patents need reform but until then it'd be nice if we could get on with the business of coding without worrying about litigation. The article's author, this Daniel guy, is obviously an Apple partisan and (thus?) a Google hater and seems to have a very bizarre recollection of computing history.",1281866159
1604871,comment,1604337,1604526,0,0,retube,,,"Visible mass is sufficient to explain the formation of stars and galaxies. What is a problem is the ""rotation curve"" of galaxies - that is orbital velocity around galactic centre as a function of distance from galactic centre. It's observed to be linear - ie stars far out are orbiting at the same velocity as stars closer in. In fact velocity should decrease with distance - see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve</a> \nDark matter has been postulated as an explanation - there must be other material that we can't see in the galaxy that results in the observed linear rotation curve.<p>Of course this assumes that the 1/r^2 holds for all distances. This is by no means certain, and it may well be that the linear curve is hint of new physics.<p>Edit: For other tantalising evidence that all is not well with 1/r^2, check out the problem with the trajectories of Pioneers 10 & 11:<p><a href=""http://moriond.in2p3.fr/J07/trans/wednesday/reynaud.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moriond.in2p3.fr/J07/trans/wednesday/reynaud.pdf</a>",1281866095

1604861,comment,1604693,1604693,0,0,jmtame,,,"i was one of the designers on loopt.com, and the reason i think most of these sites look the same is because we all go through y combinator hearing the same thing: ""the number one enemy is the back button.""  we just don't have time to overload the home pages with too much stuff if we intend on someone doing something while they're on it.  so i think all styles gravitate towards a similar highly-focused product-oriented design.<p>as for the actual ui elements.  i think a lot of companies out there, specifically the freelance design firms, are taking their inspiration from apple's mac os x ui elements.  the gradients and button styles are very similar, and then other freelance designers will look at that and try to find ways to change or improve that even further.  i think it all ultimately derives from apple though.<p>many designers i know of will use a css grid framework; we used grid 960.  the reasoning behind the number 960 pixels is described on their web site:<p>""All modern monitors support at least 1024 Ã— 768 pixel resolution. 960 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, 60, 64, 80, 96, 120, 160, 192, 240, 320 and 480.

1604846,comment,1603872,1604360,0,0,Ardit20,,,"""nor enforceable by federal prosecutors""<p>It is not the prosecution who would enforce it. It is civil law. I would take the ISP to court if they discriminate against me, not the prosecution.<p>Art. 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is one line also. It states:<p>""Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.""<p>That is very much enforceable. You can take the government to court if they do not uphold this ""romantic, childlike, wishcraft-dominated thinking""<p>Of course, the law being the law, there will be exceptions. These exceptions however in our common law system are created on a case by case basis when the facts are so as to merit an exception. Not to mention that freedom of speech is a much bigger area than the simple matter of internet traffic. Yet, we all know where we stand in regards to what we can say.<p>""I would prefer an ISP which privileged web browsing and VOIP over BitTorrent and bulk email/video/software downloads."" - That is a debate to be had. I would not want web browsing to be preferred over e-mail, which can be web browsing, video, or software or even BitTorrent though I do not use it.<p>You can not however argue, just because you preferred it, by rhetorically asking ""Why make providing a service some people will prefer a federal crime?"" I am sure some people would prefer contracting a serial killer, stealing rather than working, or more close to home, smoking weed to be legal.<p>""We've made it almost 20 years without FCC rules to protect the internet.""<p>My point earlier was that the internet was in its infancy. There were spots to be filled, small ventures to rise to big corporations, little guys to be made giants, the whole thing was very new and chaotic, everyone fighting to get a piece of the pie. Now the ISPs are sort of established, have their market shares, and perhaps just want to secure themselves. So too with big corporations. Sure they can be thrown out easier than in the real world, but the internet reflects the real world much more today than in the past 20 years.<p>In my personal opinion, the FCC would not be involved in the matter. The law would give rights to citizens. The internet is not like the telly where a few people control what we see, the internet is like the streets and just as I can sue my local council if I had an accident due to their negligence, so too I should be able to sue the ISP if they discriminate against my traffic.<p>""It is not true that ""we must assume... vast powers of control"" are about to spring some trap. We can wait until actual harms are demonstrated -- if ever. We can wait even further, until such harms persist after enough time ""<p>First, they came for the communists...<p>Healthy scepticism is good. I think that currently we all know the telecos want to prioritise traffic to make a lot of profit for themselves, we also know that this would create a tiered system of haves and have nots. We know that a level playing field is better. We know that traffic prioritisation would only benefit the telecos and big companies and screw the little guys. I would rather such things did not happen in the first place and the competition focused on improving the infrastructure and innovation, rather than bang their heads against iron doors.",1281864287

We've had interns in the past though who failed to get even the basics of our system working in os x.  The complete one is guaranteed to not run due to kernel modules we use that are only available for linux.<p>On the hardware, is not receiving Apple's a dealbreaker? Apples is definitely quite nice - and if we issued someone some low-end netbook I would definitely see a morale issue that could occur.  But a Thinkpad T-series is very high end (imo, better than a macbook when using linux)",1285142356

1715492,comment,1714338,1714798,0,0,wikyd,,,"No, they don't.  The record companies enter into a contract with the recording artist to promote and distribute their next album or X albums.  It's more like the artist is hiring the record company.  It may seem like the record company is paying the artist, but really they are paying an advance on royalties.  This is much the same as how an author may get an advance for agreeing to allow a publisher to publish their next book.<p>The advance is in some respects like an investment in a startup; the record label fronts some money to the artist to help pay for recording, living expenses, promotional expenses, etc. in exchange for a large percentage of the profits from record sales.  If the record doesn't sell well, the artist isn't under obligation to pay the advance back (although it might carry over on the ledger if they owe more albums to the label).  The size of the advance is based on the popularity and expected likelihood of success of the record.  To continue the analogy with authors, I think Sarah Palin was advanced $7 million on her last book; most tech books authors receive an advance of 4 or 5 figures.  This makes sense based on just the size of the market for each book alone.<p>Anyways, that was a long digression, but the record companies certainly do not hire artists to make music for them.  The artists hire the labels to promote and distribute their music.  Most artists have already written and created demo recordings of the songs before they even sign with a label.",1285142261

Seems to be very common, too.<p>I've had it happen, too (not life-screwing, but bad contracts): back in the day a publisher sold my J2ME app and I decided I wanted royalty shares instead of a fixed sum. The app sold 20000 times for 5€ each - I got 1000€. The thing is, they didn't actually sell the app. They gave it to a TV company for almost nothing in exchange for free advertising. So my royalties weren't a percentage of 5€, they were a percentage of maybe 30 cents... For the publisher, it was a way to promote themselves.<p>On the other hand, I see it relaxed: I had been toying with the idea of that app for years, and only when the publisher got interested did I really kick into gear and finish it. So at least I have to thank them for one published/finished project. Also, who knows what the sales would have been like without the TV advertising. And, I almost expected something to go wrong the first time I did something like this, so I chalked it up as a learning experience.",1285141128

It's OK to have policies and processes in place but the devs/drivers are the ones who have to use the equipment the most and will be most in-tune with their nuances. I have always believed in empowering the developers as much as possible because at the end of the day, their productivity is a direct result of their own actions and not the managements'.<p>I would say have a configuration in place, but if a developer wants a different setup, let them be the ultimate decision maker in the tools they use, even if the management thinks that they have something better.<p>The only company I've ever worked for (out of 4 web design jobs) that insisted certain hardware/software was an ad agency where the owner had no knowledge of web development but liked apples because they thought they were cool. I had to put up with the first-gen intel macs on OSX for about 9 months before I left.",1285139919

Allow the solution to remain on the wood for at least five minutes so the vinegar can soak into the wood and remove the odors. Rinse the vinegar off with warm water and let the hutch dry.<p>At last, if you find the corners of the wooden hutch are still dirty or smell bad after you clean with a vinegar solution, you can use baking powder to neutralize odors by sprinkling it in the corners, letting it sit for a few minutes and then wiping or rinsing it away. You can also use baking soda to scrub off any debris the vinegar solution did not lift.<p>Ensure your rabbits environment safe is important, which is good for its health.

However this is not used that often, in favour of a quantiser approach, which uses a number to indicate target quality. The encoder then changes the bitrate depending on the frames complexity and the target quality/quantiser. The quantiser approach is much more common because it's easier to specify an output quality that is independent of resolution.<p>As for the actual encoding, nearly all the computation is very specific to the output resolution/quality.

We have been getting closer and closer to this decision since Apple announced Lightning and began its new rules on the adapter.  While we were going back and forth and waiting to see if we could still build POP we realized  that we did not have a good way of refunding to our customers.  That is why on Christie Street we built a automated refund system for our inventors.  So when we finally realized that POP just could not be made to what we promised, we wanted to use our platform to do the refunds as it would be easier for us to manage.  Also it would allow us to test and tweak the system with real customers.  We are all trying to build better companies/products and looking at a loss on POP this seemed like a good way to at least salvage something out of it while delivering a above average experience to our customers, I would call that a win-win.<p>Lots of people also seem to want POP even without Lightning and our upset that we did not poll our customers to see if a USB only version.  But they are missing the point, we said in our campaign that we would support the iPhone 5 and at the time had no reason to believe that would be impossible.  Why would we have thought that they would sell the new adapter any different then the old 30 pin?<p>We are not willing to compromise on the product or deliver something that was not as promised.  If that brings skeptics, so be it but at the end of the day today I know that we are doing the right thing, not the easy thing but the right thing.",1356067149

Not only is it cooked perfectly, the fats and marinade and etc are all sealed (quite literally) with the meat so the food is chock-full of flavor.",1356066260

However, I've reached a point where I am not sure what I should be spending my time on -- should I try and pick up frameworks like Backbone and Node, or start learning a backend language like Python or Ruby?<p>I guess a better way of framing it is, will employers not hire somebody just because they don't have experience with a specific framework, or will they hire on growth potential (the idea that you can pick it up quickly)?",1356066091

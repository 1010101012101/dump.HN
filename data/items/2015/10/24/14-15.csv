Our Linode bill is about $1000p/m and most of the CPUs/disc IO is hardly used at all. The reason why we have so many instances is that each instance contributes to the total available bandwidth pool. So by having so many instances we do not pay for bandwidth overages which are very expensive ($0.1 per GB)<p>I believe there must be lots of companies who use Linode primarily for storing applications that are heavy on CPU/disc IO and use very little of the bandwidth.<p>I think there could be nice synergies in place where we could stop most of our instances and use someone&#x27;s other instances for static content and essentially paying part of someone&#x27;s Linode bill.<p>Anyone interested?",1445698699

On the other hand, you can quickly arrive at most of the same conclusion if you&#x27;ve spent extended time with dolphins.<p>I always chuckle when I&#x27;m told the Marine Mammal Protection act prohibits pursuit of dolphins. It is usually me who is being pursued. During one fishing trip we had 3 dolphins simply show up and start following us. When we would move fishing spots, even 20 miles or more away, they&#x27;d still catch up to us. Their cruise speed isn&#x27;t very high, it is probably around 12 mph. Once at the fishing spot they&#x27;d dive and start scaring the fish. Many fish will bite defensively, so this is great when you are fishing with a hook and line. Any fish we couldn&#x27;t legally keep we&#x27;d throw back, which the dolphins would immediately consume. They&#x27;d be right beside the boat looking at us as we removed the hook from the mouth of the fish.<p>Dolphins are pretty obviously intelligent enough to understand what is going on in the sea. Non-mammals in the sea react to a very basic set of cues to take action. A shark can easily be confused with a quick clap on the water surface. I&#x27;ve also watched sharks eat metallic items, which is flat out stupid. I&#x27;m willing to bet an octopus has some significant intelligence behind it, mostly because I&#x27;ve never seen one get caught on a hook. This means they are smart enough to avoid them.<p>I&#x27;ve never dealt with aggression from dolphins.<p>That said, dolphins aren&#x27;t going to pull up a chair and debate the merits of presidential candidates. When someone speaks of a dolphin &quot;mourning&quot; for another dead dolphin, I think we are just inserting what we expect a dolphin to feel. The dolphin could just as easily be confused by another dead dolphin.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen what I can only call a dolphin &quot;party&quot;. I came upon a huge group of dolphins, at least 60 or more. There were many species present. I was convinced there was a huge school of fish nearby they were feeding on. Nope, the dolphins were just hanging out. As we stopped the boat they just started jumping over the bow as if to say &quot;Thanks for joining us&quot;.",1445697059

A lot of regulations and the monopoly taxi companies get exist, so that you:\n- can actually get a ride if you don&#x27;t live in the city centre\n- can actually get a ride if you&#x27;re sick, elderly or disabled, in a car that&#x27;s equipped to handle you</i><p>Except taxi regulations don&#x27;t actually accomplish any of these things. It&#x27;s well known that if you want to go from Manhattan to Brooklyn you better get in the cab first before telling the driver that, or they&#x27;ll drive away. Even then, they might demand that you get out anyway. If you look like you might inconvenience the driver, or if you&#x27;re black, good luck getting them to even pull over in the first place.<p>You can complain of course, by sending a message into the black hole of the taxi regulation bureaucracy, but it&#x27;s unlikely anything will ever come of it. With an app that allows immediate feed back and user ratings of each driver, drivers are far more accountable to providing a satisfying customer experience than they ever were under the taxi regulations.<p>> <i>If you&#x27;re the only provider of something your customers need, you can be as evil like you want to them, and they will still buy from you.</i><p>Yes, like if you&#x27;ve manipulated the local government into making it illegal for anyone else to provide your service unless they buy a multi-hundred thousand dollar taxi medallion.",1445695924

It is actively disenfranchising a large proportion of voters. I will never have representation under the current voting system, because my views are not mainstream enough to get a majority in a single seat constituency.<p>The fiction that someone who gets the majority of a seat will represent all their constituents is just that. And blatantly offensive to many of us who consistently sees our representatives acting against our interests and not care the slightest about the portion of their constituents who are not likely to be possible to sway to vote for them.",1431176396

For me, this depends on the subject matter. When its a new language I&#x27;m learning, there&#x27;s no alternative to writing code. Languages can be very deep, and there is often a large amount of new content for your mind to overcome. Thus there are many places you can trip up when you wouldn&#x27;t have anticipated it in your head. In these cases, I write code inline with reading about it.<p>When its about design, or a more high level subject, for example about testability, I don&#x27;t usually write much code; the lessons learnt are more abstract. The code tends to require more work in these cases too, and I&#x27;m lazy. Having said that, my day job is software engineering, and combined with my side-projects there are plenty of opportunities to try out the new concepts I learn about in such resources - usually within the order of a week. This step is, in my opinion, vital. I believe you must put the concepts into practice at some point in order to truly feel comfortable with them, and the sooner the better while they are fresh in your mind.<p>2. I&#x27;m a first principles guy, so don&#x27;t like building up knowledge on unknown foundations. I re-read until I understand it, and then advance. This of course assumes that the structure of the resource has been carefully considered, with few forward references. When the author declares that something specific will be explained in chapter X, I&#x27;m happy to take their word for it, but in the absence of such statements it makes for uncertainty.\nThankfully, in my experience most authors I have read do take the time to add such assurances, so its possible to read in a continuous manner from start to finish.<p>3. In the past I have skipped the majority of these exercises. In this case psychology seems to be against us - we underestimate the unknown unknowns, so tasks seem simpler than they really are. For this reason I am actively trying to do the exercises properly these days. I tend to do the simple ones in my head, and the more complex ones in real code. The way I distinguish between simple and complex is &quot;Can I write out the exact syntax of the solution in my head start to finish?&quot;.",1431175097

Hearing well-off middle class people, typically White, debate lower class struggles. I lived through this. All of my friends had the same opportunities. I’m not exceptionally talented, but I got out and they stayed in the ghetto. I graduated high school, they dropped out. They bought Nikes and Nintendos, I went to the public library.<p>Ultimately, from what I experienced growing up, the poor keep each other down. So while they chose friends, I chose solitude. Because “fitting in” meant remaining poor, choosing crime and materialism over education and grades.",1431173658

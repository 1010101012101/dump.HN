39404,comment,39301,39301,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"Why not let us see who has upvoted/downvoted our comments? It's frustrating when someone downvotes without explanation, especially if it's not an obviously stupid comment. <p>But all posters are not created equal - what if we could consider the source? If some guy with -27 karma downvotes my comment I could care less. If it's someone like Paul Buchheit, on the other hand, I have to consider the possibility that my comment was really stupid.",1186267922

39399,comment,39301,39353,0,0,Alex3917,,,"It'll be interesting to see if this change would affect the content on Reddit at all. Normally if you want to ride the aggregation train the ideal strategy is to wait until you hit the top of news.yc before submitting to Reddit, and then wait until you make the front page of Reddit before submitting to Digg. If good stories start hitting the #1 spot on this site during nights or on the weekends, it could potentially have some interesting ripple effects further up the chain. \n",1186266020

39397,comment,39301,39341,0,0,mark-t,,,"> Viewing and not upvoting something is like half a downvote anyway.<p>This statement depends a lot on your habits. I open up 5-10 links at a time and then read through them all. I rarely remember to go back and upvote, and I reserve that for _really_ good articles, anyway. And of course you can't say anything about comments, since there's no telling whether somebody even reads all the comments when he opens a page with comments on it.",1186265936

Also, it doesn't actually tell me anything useful.<p>I don't think having the problem solved in Erlang and functional languages is even close to enough, though. No offense, but there just aren't a lot of people using them. I think something like <a href=""http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/</a> (Intel's open source C++ threading building blocks library) would be more along the lines of a real solution.",1186265289

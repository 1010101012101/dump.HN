1031731,comment,1031197,1031369,0,0,vlad,,,"<i>People often confuse ""making a game easy"" with ""making a game rewarding"". The worst thing you can do is make your game too easy</i><p>Maybe I misread, but what you wrote is exactly the opposite of the point Jeff makes.  Jeff is respected in the indie games community, and has created shareware games since 1994, while you just graduated college this year.  I bring that up because he wrote a whole article explaining his point, while you simply wrote a statement saying it is the worst thing.  Why?<p><i>the best thing you can do is reinforce every single correct user action with positive feedback and a reward.</i><p>Rewarding as many user actions as possible is known to be an important tactic and is not something the author disagreed with (and is likely something he believes as well.) Why was it used as a counter point?<p>Also, why do you believe that reinforcing every ""correct"" user action is on the opposite end of the spectrum of making games easy?<p>Rewarding user actions with points and spiffy effects is actually a part of making the game very easy.  People want to feel successful for doing anything at all in casual games, and giving rewards and accolades for easy-to-accomplish tasks (as seen in games like Peggle) is part of making the game easy.<p>And what you call ""correct"" user actions in casual games such as Peggle would be better called ""rewarded"" actions.  As players click around the screen, they are rewarded for coming closer to a goal, often having no idea why they got those points.  Additionally, many successful casual games are designed so that even user actions that are completely ineffective are rewarded with points to the point that this is an inside joke between casual game developers.  That is what I mean when I say that making games easy is correlated, not the opposite of, rewarding players often, and also why games are not necessarily about rewarding user behaviors as much as keeping them feeling confident and playing.  Finally, this is also what I believe Jeff is talking about.",1262659978

I've also noticed that finding good Perl people to work with has never been much of a problem, but that may just be an artifact of location (Vancouver/Victoria) and previous experience (I know a lot of ex-ActiveStaters).  My experience has been that some of the more hyped languages/frameworks have a lot of snakeoil salesmen jumping on their bandwagon, which can make it tricky to discern the talented from the talkers.<p>One of the problems that the Perl community has (I think) is a lot of us don't really hype Perl that much as being the driving force behind some of the cool products we build in the same way that the Rails community, or some of the more ""popular"" frameworks/language communities do.

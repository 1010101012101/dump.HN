Don't mention the rest though - as a corporate drone I learned the hard way (a good amount > 70h/week for roughly a year) that there's only one correct reaction to requests like this from my manager:<p>1) Smile and say that you don't agree, point out what might work<p>2) Don't follow that request (in my home country it's even against the law as soon as you require certain amounts. Unless you're in very specific scenarios)<p>3) Go elsewhere<p>And - the biggest lesson of all: Avoid peer pressure and congratulate your coworkers that don't back down and leave after a 10 hour day, instead of joking about his part-time job attitude. Cost me dearly to learn these lessons - but I'm sure I'll never forget those.",1333475949

Assuming that the policy to require a signature from the patient stands, fax seems like a pretty natural choice for sending a paper form. Alternatively, they could take the time to scan the form then email it.<p>Ideally, both you and I would probably prefer something completely digital (both forms and health records).  Towards that goal, I think the biggest problem would be interoperability.  Someone like Kaiser could (and maybe they do) use all digital things between themselves, because they can enforce a uniform software platform.<p>One nice thing that I've seen about some digital medical record systems is that they print out nice reports.  That is a good fallback system, so that you can still fax or email simple documents around.",1333475559

However, as I see it, the problem with our current language ecosystem isn't ""we lack a safe, fast, low-level language in which to implement things""; as you've pointed out, we've long had Ada. Instead, the problem is ""people are using C++ to laboriously construct applications that, while not safety-critical, still require a high degree of reliability"". This is a social problem rather than a technical one, and it probably has more to do with path dependence and resistance to unfamiliarity than with the technical merits of the modern iterations of either language.<p>In a perfect world, perhaps we'd be using Ada for all tasks that currently require C++. However, the fact that we're still using C++ over Ada suggests to me that there is still room for new languages in this area. I agree that it's sad to see so much redundancy and duplication of effort. But if the end result of all of this is that future applications are written in a more reliable language, isn't that still a net win for society, regardless of what that language is?",1333475551

Price competition implies scarcitysupply and demand market forces. There is no scarcity for ebooks because digital files are replicated practically for free.""<p>What Jason is alluding too, but no quite jumping into, is the economics of information. In the economics off goods, there is a limit to the supply of the goods, that limit is created by the economic forces of production. Basically the more it costs to produce an item, the higher the price has to be to recover those costs. But what doesn't change is the <i>value</i> of the good. That is why for some physical goods they are ""impossible"" to make economically because the cost of producing them exceeds their value.<p>In an information market the cost to produce something is very very low, but its value doesn't change. A book on design is valuable to everyone who needs to solve a design problem. Even if there are a billion copies of the book out there, the value is still in every one of them. So what Jason captures is that pricing information requires one to consider pricing 'value' and the value of information is directly related not to its cost of production, but to its cost or procurement.<p>Thus pricing a book for $40 which has information which would cost $400 to procure by hiring a consultant for a couple of hours represents a 'good value'. Pricing it for $6 will capture additional market but it leaves money on the table as well.<p>Its a different world and one that is not yet taught in business school as far as I can tell.",1333474736

There are pros and cons to this approach; the main arguments in favor of it revolve around the concepts of design-by-contract, and being able to enforce that contract, which lets you code less defensively.<p>[1] I get the feeling that Go's main design goal is <i>ease of use</i>, on par with Python.",1333474150

Using these weights, the midpoint is a weighted average of half and the proportion of upvotes.<p>It should be very clear that if the total becomes large, a goes to 1 and b to zero. At that point you end up using the proportion of upvotes, just like Amazon.<p>Now, lets bring in the entire confidence interval.<p><pre><code>     def wilson(upvotes:Int, downvotes:Int) = {\n      val z = 1.96\n      val n = upvotes+downvotes+0.0d\n      val phat = upvotes/n\n\n      val lower = (phat + z*z/(2*n) - z * sqrt((phat*(1-phat)+z*z/(4*n))/n))/(1+z*z/n)\n      val upper = (phat + z*z/(2*n) + z * sqrt((phat*(1-phat)+z*z/(4*n))/n))/(1+z*z/n)\n      (lower,upper)\n      }\n</code></pre>\nUsing the author's data points, the results look like this:<p><pre><code>     val itemVotes = List((600,400),(5500,4500),(2,0), (100,1))\n     itemVotes.foreach( x => {\n      val s = mid(x._1,x._2)\n      val w = wilson(x._1,x._2)\n      printf(""Up:%5d\tDown:%5d\tMid:%.3f\tW:[%.3f,%.3f]\n"", \n      x._1, x._2,s,w._1,w._2)\n      })\n\n       scala> Up:  600	Down:  400	Mid:0.600	W:[0.569,0.630]\n        Up: 5500	Down: 4500	Mid:0.550	W:[0.540,0.560]\n        Up:    2	Down:    0	Mid:0.667	W:[0.342,1.000]\n        Up:  100	Down:    1	Mid:0.971	W:[0.946,0.998]\n</code></pre>\nBasically, we prefer the lower bound of the confidence interval instead of the midpoint of that same interval.",1333473620

There's a time to grow yourself, and there's also a time to ship your product.<p>""From a business point of view, long hours by programmers are a key to profitability. Suppose that a programmer needs to spend 25 hours per week keeping current with new technology, getting coordinated with other programmers, contributing to documentation and thought leadership pieces, and comprehending the structures of the systems being extended. Under this assumption, a programmer who works 55 hours per week will produce twice as much code as one who works 40 hours per week. In The Mythical Man-Month, the only great book ever written on software engineering, Fred Brooks concludes that no software product should be designed by more than two people. He argues that a program designed by more than two people might be more complete but it will never be easy to understand because it will not be as consistent as something designed by fewer people. This means that if you want to follow the best practices of the industry in terms of design and architecture, the only way to improve speed to market is to have the same people working longer hours. Finally there is the common sense notion that the smaller the team the less management overhead. A product is going to get out the door much faster if it is built by 4 people working 70-hour weeks (180 productive programmer-hours per week, after subtracting for 25 hours of coordination and structure comprehension time) than if by 12 people working 40-hour weeks (the same net of 180 hours per week). The 12-person team will inevitably require additional managers and all-day meetings to stay coordinated.""[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3547965"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3547965</a> (secondary source)",1333473562

But the only reason we find it easier than binary data is because we don't have built-in arbitrary binary parsers for the data.<p>When you read a text format or protocol your brain is doing the job that a good debugger or parser should be doing. Because these tools don't exist for your protocol, you think <i>""boy how handy that I can just parse this file with my brain! It's a good thing I learned <INSERT NATURAL LANGUAGE> and that this format/protocol was written with it, and that I have decades of experience groking it.""</i> If your only option for debugging is to open the raw format or protocol and pick at it by hand or try to eyeball it looking for some anomaly, you're just lacking a real tool to help you do the job quicker and more effectively.<p>Consider two separate formats: ELF and PostScript.<p>ELF is a binary format which is flexible and extensible. The data it comprises is almost entirely non-human-specific; you aren't going to read it because it's not for you, it's for the computer only. Yet a wide range of platforms have adopted it as their code file format. It could have easily been implemented in text, but what would be the point? Easier debugging? Plenty of tools exist to examine, dump and compare the properties of these files, making an inherent textual representative redundant.<p>Now look at PostScript. A (relatively) simple, readable text control language to determine the output of a complex document. The problem is PostScript is more of an interpreted programming language than a file format. Instead of using a method to craft a pre-processed document for the printer, the printer had to add a costly interpreter for the document format in order to produce documents on the fly. Early laser printers had microprocessors faster than the Macintosh computers that connected to them. Was it easy to grok, edit, debug? Yes. But it also made for a more costly device to handle all that built-in textual flexibility.<p>To me, the best way to tell if you need a text format/protocol or not is determining the humanity of your program. Will I need to interface with the internals of this on a regular basis? Might it become so complex and large in the future that a tool to debug it might become necessary? And how much work would it really be to just write it once and enjoy it forever?",1333472763

A real-world example I've been dealing with lately are the sln, csproj, and xml files used by Visual Studio. VS is constantly rearranging entries in these files when I modify my projects. Add a dependency to one project, and VS will resort all of the dependency guids for all of the other projects in the solution. When I check my change in, the sln file looks like I've made hundreds of changes (I've got a lot of projects in my solutions) when I've only made one change.<p>Of course, VS shouldn't be doing that. But it's probably not even intentional; I'll bet the VS developers thought ""Hey, we should use XML for our sln files because it's textual and readable"", and they chose an XML serialization library that was already part of the platform. Then the completely separate group responsible for the XML serialization library probably thought ""Hey, when we're serializing this particular type of data structure, let's sort the list elements by something arbitrary, like their memory address"", and now your sln file gets re-arranged every time you modify it.

Google was the default search engine and Google the default maps<p>They betrayed SJ, stabbed him in the back ""Et tu Brute""? They appear to have used insider knowledge of the iPhone to secretly switch the Android from a Blackberry to iPhone look alike, allegedly stealing IP wholesale from Oracle, Microsoft and of course Apple and created a mortal enemy of SJ who, quite naturally declared nuclear war on these treacherous ......s. But far from benefitting Google shareholders, Android is a money pit sucking the lifeblood out of Google.<p>Google have invested countless billions in Android, even more billions in buying that other money pit Motorola, have enmeshed themselves in the most humungously expensive global litigation mess imaginable, being sued by three of the richest and most successful companies on the planet. They are facing death by a thousand cuts, with unimaginably large legal fees, damages, licence fees and compensation, to say nothing of destroying Google's reputation as the ""Good"" ""Do No Evil"" company, turning it into into the most sordid, hacker, privacy and IP robber of all time and the probability of facing serious anti-trust investigations by the US and EU.<p>And all for what? 80% of their mobile revenue comes from their mortal enemy Apple, who will leave no stone unturned to stick in and twist the knife and will doubtless use Siri to undermine and exploit Google search and Google maps, hiding the vital user information that Google need, depriving them of the advertising revenue which is their whole raison d'tre.<p>Remember: this is just $1.70 of revenue (NOT PROFITS) per user. It means that Google are running massive losses on every Android device, while Microsoft are earning net profits from the licensing to Android OEMs amounting to more than 5 times as much as Google's revenue. To make matters worse, Amazon have castrated Google's revenue by forking Android cutting off their revenue stream. Samsung and other OEMs may do the same.<p>But the real sword of Damocles for Android is Apple's world wide legal battle to stop them using Apple IP. This campaign is still at an early stage, given the snails pace of litigation, but is beginning to show signs of real progress. Bit by bit Apple is degrading Android stripping it of the user satisfaction of iOS's look and feel. Perhaps the most significant Apple victory is the recent ruling by Judge Posner upholding the largest part of Apple's touchscreen heuristics ('949) patent in their case against Motorola. Winning this patent case against Motorola could be a turning point, stripping Android of its iPhone gestures, and turning Motorola to stinking, rotting carcase around Google's neck.<p>What is most amazing about Motorola and to a lesser extent Samsung is that their principle defence case against Apple and Microsoft consists of attempting to abuse essential patents protected by FRAND, which is likely to bring crashing upon their heads (and of Google who have publicly supported their underhand tactics) the wrath of the EU and US anti-trut bodies. Bear in mind that the EU can fine all three companies 3 times their annual turnover for such gross and barefaced violations. Google now have few friends in Europe and the knives are circling. Perhaps it is soon going to be ""Et tu Brute"" time for Google. Revenge is sweet, as they say!</i>",1333472401

MongoDB makes the up front choice of performance and scalability over consistency, they have never pretended that was not the case. That does not mean that MongoDB looses data left and right, it means that in the choice between bringing a production app to a halt and loosing data, MongoDB will opt to keep your app running.<p>Second, and this is a shameless plug, I really believe that the DB I work for (Neo4j) is a good answer to your question. Neo4j makes the same consistency vs. uptime decision that classic RDBMes do. In the choice between bringing a production app to a halt and loosing data, Neo4j will opt for saving the data.<p>So, to answer your question: Neo4j lets you store semi-structured documents in a manner somewhat similar to MongoDB, with the added comfort of full ACID compliance. It also lets you specify indexes to do exactly what you describe.",1320666016

Some of it is concerning - it seems it can crumble under heavy write load - not so great for a DB who's selling point is ""fast at scale"".<p>Part of Mongo's charm is how it works on a stock system. For traditional DB's, they cache stuff in RAM, then the OS caches the stuff they cached in RAM and swaps their cache to disk. Then you modify something, and the OS swaps the DB cache from disk to RAM, then the DB tells the OS to write the change to disk invalidating your OS disk cache, which then ... you get the picture. Mongo (and Couch) use the OS's cache, which is suboptimal on a tuned machine, but optimal on something you just threw together.",1320665264

You come up with a few points (supported by examples, augments, or references - depending on the requirements), throw in some formulatic meta-discussion (i.e. '... though it may be more important to ask ""why"", not ""if"" ...') and get the fucker done.

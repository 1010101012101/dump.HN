The ""Feedback"" link could be made the same color as the backing oak leaf/acorn cluster, or green for more contrast and consistency with the organic theme.<p>I don't mind the name so much.

I think the European countries that have outlawed spanking are much more civilized.<p>Curi:  Do you think states should outlaw spanking, or do anything to discourage it?

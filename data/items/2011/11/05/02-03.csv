You would expect more seed deals to go through these sites, since they will typically cast a wider net. Later deals will be more private, unpublicized, and with companies that are already connected to institutional funds. It would be much more interesting to see numbers from SEC filings in the tech sector.",1320461962

Look at this huge discussion here <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3177729"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3177729</a> about something that he said.<p>So I believe Jobs saying the equivalent of ""Those that can , do technology and those that can't, do charity."" sends a very wrong message to many budding entrepreneurs who may go on to become super rich in the future. An influential man's words live on beyond his grave and influence people. This is not about disparaging him as much as disagreeing with him on that particular opinion, which many people here seem unable to do.",1320461920

3198725,comment,3195900,3196648,1,0,ellyagg,,,"I read your linked comment, but I didn't find it persuasive. I'm no language Nazi. It's clear that language pedants are a pet peeve of yours, and that's fine, but language being fluid is not the same thing as language not having boundaries. It also doesn't imply that users of the language can be prevented from having opinions about its usage. We all together decide the standard, as I'm sure you'll agree. Currently, it's still true today that people in educated circles find ""could care less"" and ""irregardless"" to be ugly usage. I think there's good reason for that, but I don't plan to make a detailed analysis here. Steven Pinker's analysis notwithstanding, nothing in the linked comment is dispositive.<p>My original comment was not prescriptive. I do not claim to be the ultimate authority of the language because no such authority exists. It's hard for people to imagine, but what constitutes proper English is actually probabilistic. Some stuff is 75% good English and some stuff is 50% good English. Some idioms are more or less good English. I find the constructions under discussion to be less good, and my opinion carries the authority of my fraction of say-so as a member of the English using community.<p>But, frankly, I'm off track. My original point was to call attention to the inappropriate tone of one of the disputants, not participate in more natural language pedantry on the Internet.",1320461906

Here's the advice:<p>Learn how to interview well. Knowing what github is, having actually launched a site, and wrangling some freelance work together puts you ahead of 90% of the people I worked with at my Big Co. job, you just need to be able to prove it and convince people of it. The competition for most positions consists of bored CS grads from Java schools who never learned how to use version control and for whom programming is just a job. You have passion it appears, and that can't be overrated.<p>I was willing to be aggressive with my first interview, noting that I would be able to accept a lower-than-market rate if they would do a salary review shortly after I started. Not everyone is in the position to do so, but I took a 'whatever it takes' attitude to get started, with the confidence in myself that once people saw how effective I could be, things would get better.

That maximizes the amount of after-work sunlight, without sacrificing daytime sunlight. Despite the existence of people who prefer early morning daylight, I think that maximizes social efficiency.<p>Of course it's not (currently) practical to continuously adjust, so DST is a coarse approximation.<p>I do appreciate the ridiculousness of changing the clocks instead of changing our schedules. But I think it's impossible to coordinate the change in schedules. You'd have too many defectors and the whole thing would fall apart. Think about the massive interdependence: work schedules, daycare, trains, social activities, etc etc. It really has to happen all together en masse or it doesn't work.<p>Whether it's worth the hassle (and, yes, the real cost in lost productivity and sleep disruption) is of course still debatable but I think those declaring it pure insanity haven't fully thought it through.<p>PS: Interesting exception that proves the rule: Arizona opts out of DST because it gets so hot in the afternoon and evening that people actually prefer the early morning daylight.",1320459989

For context, my firm (CB Insights) tracks this data so I'm not flying blind here (at least not completely)<p>Quote:  The solution to this structural problem in the startup economy is simple: we need more venture funds.  Unfortunately, thousands of funds around the world have been killed off since 2007.<p>This is really not accurate or realistic.  Many venture funds have died for a reason - their returns were terrible.  In short, they deserved to die because they didn't perform.    The Limited Partners in those funds decided not to invest more in those funds, and as a result those funds are no more.  This is a good thing as its the way markets and resource allocation are supposed to work (albeit the market is imperfect but that's a rant for another day).  If anyone can name a fund with an above benchmark IRR that was ""killed"", I will stand corrected.<p>The one negative of these crappy returning funds is is that some of those LPs may have soured on the VC asset class overall and so might be gunshy to invest in another VC fund.  That's perhaps happened but nevertheless, the idea that funds were ""killed off"" is inaccurate. They were given some rope and hung themselves with poor returns.<p>Quote:  First, you have a large number of high-quality companies that need capital, while the competition to provide capital is decreasing. Second, you have a pool of frustrated limited partners looking for new managers.<p>Capital will find its way to great opportunities.  And that capital may not always come from VCs.  We track hedge funds investing in private companies through sidepocket funds, family offices investing their money in these companies, angels, corporates, etc.  If there is a good opportunity, someone will invest especially now when it seems everyone wants to invest in the next FB, Twitter, Groupon, Zynga, etc.<p>The problem is that ""high quality"" as a descriptor means nothing.  Great companies whose metrics are killer, whose growth is up and to the right and who are in the right space (mobile photo sharing app anyone?) will get their Series A.  It's the folks who are kinda up and kinda down that have trouble.  Are these high quality companies?  Who knows?  They might be good companies one day but maybe the odds of them generating venture level returns is now not realistic.  And so they're orphaned and they'll die.  That sounds terrible but there is a VC conversion funnel and has been forever.  Not everyone gets follow-on funding. It's the rules.<p>Just 1 in 100 angel deals may get funded by venture capitalists today, yet there are probably at least 10 strong startups in a 100, if not more.<p>As commenter staunch says, ""Citation Needed"".  There is no support for this beyond a gut feel.<p>Finally, here is the reality on Seed VC deals.  If done by a large VC, they are ""call options"".  If the company kills it with that money, the VC has the first look at them and can invest in the Series A.  If they don't grow like heck, it's just a seed investment so not lots of capital at risk.<p>Totally unrelated but since this response was longer than expected, I'm gonna sneak this in -- we're hiring so check us out - www.cbinsights.com",1320459256

I guess Bill Gates gets a bigger thrill saving a hundred thousand  of the poorest 10% of the world from suffering with AIDS or dying from malaria or starvation rather than sell an extra ten million phones or tablets to the richest 10% of the world.<p><a href=""http://www.newser.com/story/130728/bill-gates-aids-program-saved-100k-indians-study.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newser.com/story/130728/bill-gates-aids-program-s...</a><p>>Am I to think more of him if he gave away more money than Steve Jobs? What a ridiculous notion. If you buy that argument, I ask you to think less of him because he spent fewer of the limited number of hours of his lifetime on philanthropy than some of the people who inherited a fortune and spend their lives on charitable causes. Or less of him because he didnt minister to the sick and needy in Calcuttas slums.<p>I think that when it comes to a human quality like selflessness and empathy there's nothing wrong with thinking more of people like Mother Teresa, and next billionaires who contribute a lot of their money or time to charitable contributions. You don't need to think of less of anyone to respect good qualities in others.<p>Even Jobs took the help of philanthropic causes like the Hare Rama Hare Krishna temple's free meals to the poor.<p>From his Standford commencement address:<p>>It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it.\n--\n>Stanford Commencement Address, 12 Jun 2005<p>Anyway my personal theory is that Bill Gates had enough being on top of the world in the late 1990s and early 2000s that me moved on to bigger things, eradicating preventable diseases like malaria/AIDS and helping the poorest of the poor and felt it was a better use of his time and money for a higher ideal in life.<p>Jobs had to prove himself after coming back to Apple and Apple is just now taking off under his stewardship and he's still too involved in Apple's day to day operations. I definitely believe he would have had the time and inclination to do better for the third world in his later years after leading success to Apple if he had survived his totally unfortunate cancer that cut his life short. He simply didn't have enough time.",1320458466

But as a general rule, I don't agree. The goal should be to write code that's both loosely coupled and highly cohesive enough that you can defer as many changes or decisions as possible to the latest point possible. While this might involve spending more time in planning, the process of developing will itself impact the overall design (in most, but not all, cases).",1320458445

On the other hand it's interesting to compare some of the IT-made billionaires to the traditional billionaires. Bill Gates was not born into money* but ended up drowning in them. He probably sees both the diminishing marginal utility of exorbitant wealth and the tendency of profits to accumulate exponentially. As a nerd, he's probably unable to give into a lavish lifestyle anyway, so he does the best thing of giving back. He can hope to be remembered in history for that, because, after all, how many rich people made history just for being rich?<p>[*] he wasn't poor, probably more than middle class; in any case, there's no doubt he's self-made",1320458422

Next question.<p>Or you can agree with Jobs but say that the world is still a better place for what Bill has done. Also great, next question.<p>Either way, why waste time worrying about something a dead man said? Jobs is maggot-food now. Gates is here with us.<p>Decide for yourself whether you like or dislike Gates. I can easily do so without worrying whether Jobs liked him or not. And I can easily decide to admire what Jobs did or didnt accomplish without worrying whether he had anything of value to say outside of his field of expertise.<p>Anyways, like I said, Im supportive of people admiring what Mr. Gates is doing with his life today. And really, what he did with his life (past tense) is done, finished, no way to unwind it, so why worry about it. All Im saying is, worrying about how it compares to Jobs or what Jobs said... This is not the best way to think about Mr. Gates, who deserves to be judged for his contribution just the way it is.",1320458413

Bruce Evans doesn't explicitly mention this fact, but it's the core of his reasoning.<p>Since long is 64-bits on 64-bit architecture, and 32 on 32-bit architecture.  This is the reason that 0xffffffff is showing up as a non-negative number on the 64-bit machine, but shows up as negative on the 32-bit.<p>Changing the type to int(which is 32 bits long on both x86 and x64), while it does break 16-bit systems(which don't exist anymore), fixes this completely by removing the x86 and x64 behavior differences with the long type.<p>The two style issues that he mentions are easily fixed by moving the variable declaration to the top of the function and initializing it there.

Foremost among them is that it enables them to make short-term plays that are risky or harmful to the company in the long run. A $500,000-per-year job is one that an executive desperately wants to keep. A $25 million-per-year job, with four years' pay as a golden parachute, is one that can safely be blown up after a couple years. (No CEO intentionally blows up, but many take stupid risks driven by ego and status-based avarice that they would be less inclined to take if paid modest salaries and thereby more attached to their jobs.)<p>There are two reasons why executive overpay exists. The first is self-dealing by a small, socially closed elite. They do it because they can. The second is to motivate younger people who greatly overestimate their chances of ascending to such ranks: printing dreambucks, I call it. I would argue, were it not for the cultural corrosion the overpay causes, that executive pay is actually a very, very cheap mechanism for achieving the 2nd goal. Overpaying executives does motivate people to want to get to that rank. The problem is more subtle and cultural: what does it motivate them to do? Be more creative? No. Be more ethical? Certainly not. Be more ruthless? Sure, but ""ruthless"" is a hair's breadth away from psychopathic and workplace psychopaths (cf. Fiorina) can destroy companies.",1300996474

Stick 'em up on S3 (with or without CDN), and they'll almost certainly be fine.<p>General HTTP isn't something we can really answer for you.  If your PHP is memory intensive, there's a different remediation plan than if it's more CPU intensive.  Regardless, you want to be leveraging a cache wherever you can.  For the most part, unless you're excessively out of the norm on either memory or CPU, you'll likely be fine on a fairly small instance, so long as you abstract the DB away from there.<p>Versus petervandijck's advice, I would recommend a number of smaller, load balanced EC2 instances instead of one big EC2 instance.  It might add a little bit of complexity, but if you start off load balancing an $11 a month micro instance, it's easier to spin up additional instances as you need them, while keeping your base cost low.  Alternately, you could of course spin up an $80 a month instance, and have less to worry about on the higher end, but it also costs more even if you aren't under load.<p>As for the database, I'll leave that to my betters, but memcached is your friend.",1300996331

2365603,comment,2365005,2365005,0,0,johnnygood,,,"In Rackspace's defense, this might be more of an issue of lack of community.  Sometimes it's hard to get other people involved and excited about an open source project.  It's a lot easier for them to go to NASA, Dell, CloudKick and others and get them to attach their name/logo to a participants page than to get real participants.  OpenStack isn't something most web people will be interested in.  It's infrastructure.  Many, many companies need programmers and tools for them.  Very few companies out there are saying, ""you know, I'd like to build a server farm of 200 machines to give me a petabyte of distributed object storage with replication policies, failover, the works"".  Most people would rather just farm that out to S3 since, well, very few companies store that much.  Like, OpenStack's Object Storage is a lot of work if you're just going to be storing 100GB.  There's no way you could do it cheaper than the $15 S3 is going to charge for that storage since you'd need at least two machines.<p>How many of us could justify spending a lot of time on running our own object store rather than using S3?  It makes sense that Rackspace is a lot more interested in it.  I'd say that you'd need to be in the several terrabyte range before it makes sense to think about it.  Clearly sites like Facebook, Flickr, and imgur want to run their own storage - they store a lot.  But how many web firms do?  I'm not saying it isn't an awesome project and I was excited when it came out.  However, I'd have to be working on a site that stored a lot to justify building my own cloud storage cluster.<p>For what it's worth, it would be awesome for everyone if this engineer went on to create a Cloud Files and Cloud Storage competitor using Open Stack and worked with Rackspace without any grudge.  Sometimes that's how openness happens.  However, there tend to be fewer infrastructure vendors than web apps and so an infrastructure project like this can't be expected to garner the same attention as something like Apache or nginx which lots of people will be running rather than mostly a few infrastructure vendors.  For most web operations, it doesn't make sense to pay a lot of money to build this infrastructure when you can get it for cheaper from Amazon, Rackspace, and others.<p>It might not be that Rackspace is being closed.  It might just be that there are few operations that want to help develop these tools and most of them already have their own tools.  Flickr and Facebook aren't going to drop their storage engine for OpenStack. Amazon isn't going to replace S3's software with OpenStack.  SoftLayer does have their own cloud storage solution, but it isn't as widely used so there's a possibility there, if not a large one.<p>It's great that it's open source and if Rackspace keeps up the development and it's of high-quality it might start getting used by the next Facebook and Flickr style companies that need that type of storage.  But it will happen slowly compared to the adoption of nginx, Django, MongoDB, etc.",1300996175

None of them knew this would be a public documentary so they were pretty open without the typical political correctness.<p>Somewhat surprisingly to me, I found the most mature amongst  his peers to be Ivanka Trump.  She acknowledged her wealth, but at the same time made it clear that given her head start in life, she planned to work hard to make her own path in life.  And judging from accounts from a couple people who went to school with her at Penn, she's pretty sharp. I liked her.<p>But most of the others seemed to fall into two groups:<p>1) At a loss for what they should do in life given the massive amount of wealth they knew they had at their disposal.  One of the main concerns for this group is just not to lose the family's money. (Jamie Johnson himself and his father fell into this category)<p>2) An arrogant disdain for those not in their self-determined ""class"".

The only choice we get is what to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship - be it JC or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan mother-goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of ethical principles - is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things - if they are where you tap real meaning in life - then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff already - it's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness. Worship power - you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart - you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.<p>The insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful; it is that they are unconscious. They are default settings. They're the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing.""<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/sep/20/fiction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/sep/20/fiction</a>",1300994594

People don't like to admit this, clinging to the notion of an atomic ""self"", but a few years in that kind of environment changes a person into someone unrecognizable by the younger, better person who went in.

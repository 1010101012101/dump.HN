Then I realized it's basically <i>Twilight</i> for teenaged boys and started to think about it more critically.<p>Ender is an impossible creature and creates an archetype that cannot be lived up to. People make mistakes, it's what makes them learn, advance, succeed, become stronger. Ender is some kind of perverted ideal.<p>The way this essay describes military strategies makes it seems like those running today's theaters are absolute idiots that simply smash one group of soldiers to another just like the British did in the 1800s. This is not the case. ""Attrition theory"" is not what's employed in individual battles, pawn-for-pawn style exchanges. The US Army, as an example, takes extremely low numbers of casualties with staggeringly high numbers of casualties inflicted.<p>Most of these bold claims about Card's novel seem like fluff on closer examination. They're plot drivers for a novel and in that sense they bear a similarity to real-life examples. Nothing more.",1360817899

5217813,comment,5215884,5215884,49,0,nsrivast,,,"OP is a friend of mine, and when I first heard of his problem I wondered if there might be an analytical solution to quantify the difference between intelligent vs naive routing. I took this problem as an opportunity to teach myself a bit of Queueing Theory[1], which is a fascinating topic! I'm still very much a beginner, so bear with me and I'd love to get any feedback or suggestions for further study.<p>For this example, let's assume our queueing environment is a grocery store checkout line: our customers enter, line up in order, and are checked out by one or more registers. The basic way to think about these problems is to classify them across three parameters:<p>- arrival time: do customers enter the line in a way that is <i>D</i>eterministic (events happen over fixed intervals), rando<i>M</i> (events are distributed exponentially and described by Poisson process), or <i>G</i>eneral (events fall from an arbitrary probability distribution)?<p>- checkout time: same question for customers getting checked out, is that process <i>D</i> or <i>M</i> or <i>G</i>?<p>- <i>N</i> = # of registers<p>So the simplest example would be <i>D</i>/<i>D</i>/1, where - for example - every 3 seconds a customer enters the line and every 1.5 seconds a customer is checked out by a single register. Not very exciting. At a higher level of complexity, <i>M</i>/<i>M</i>/1, we have a single register where customers arrive at rate <i>_L</i> and are checked out at rate <i>_U</i> (in units of # per time interval), where both <i>_L</i> and <i>_U</i> obey Poisson distributions. (You can also model this as an infinite Markov chain where your current node is the # of people in the queue, you transition to a higher node with rate <i>_L</i> and to a lower node with rate <i>_U</i>.) For this system, a customer's average total time spent in the queue is 1/(<i>_U</i> - <i>_L</i>) - 1/<i>_U</i>.<p>The intelligent routing system routes each customer to the next available checkout counter; equivalently, each checkout counter grabs the first person in line as soon as it frees up. So we have a system of type <i>M</i>/<i>G</i>/<i>R</i>, where our checkout time is <i>G</i>enerally distributed and we have <i>R</i>>1 servers. Unfortunately, this type of problem is analytically intractable, as of now. There are approximations for waiting times, but they depend on all sorts of thorny higher moments of the general distribution of checkout times. But if instead we assume the checkout times are randomly distributed, we have a <i>M</i>/<i>M</i>/<i>R</i> system. In this system, the total time spent in queue per customer is C(<i>R</i>, <i>_L</i>/<i>_U</i>)/(<i>R</i> <i>_U</i> - <i>_L</i>), where C(a,b) is an involved function called the Erlang C formula [2].<p>How can we use our framework to analyze the naive routing system? I think the naive system is equivalent to  an <i>M</i>/<i>M</i>/1 case with arrival rate <i>_L_dumb</i> = <i>_L</i>/<i>R</i>. The insight here is that in a system where customers are instantaneously and randomly assigned to one of <i>R</i> registers, each register should have the same queue characteristics and wait times as the system as a whole. And each register has an arrival rate of 1/<i>R</i> times the global arrival rate. So our average queue time per customer in the dumb routing system is 1/(<i>_U</i> - <i>_L</i>/<i>R</i>) - 1/<i>_U</i>.<p>In OP's example, we have on average 9000 customers arriving per minute, or <i>_L</i> = 150 customers/second. Our mean checkout time is 306ms, or <i>_U</i> ~= 3. Evaluating for different <i>R</i> values gives the following queue times (in ms):<p># Registers	51	60	75	100	150	200	500	1000	2000	4000<p>dumb routing	16,667	1,667	667	333	167	111	37	18	9	4<p>smart routing	333	33	13	7	3	2	1	0	0	0<p>which are reasonably close to the simulated values. In fact, we would expect the dumb router to be comparatively even worse for the longer-tailed Weibull distribution they use to model request times, because you make bad outcomes (e.g. where two consecutive requests at 99% request times are routed to the same register) even more costly. This observation seems to agree with some of the comments as well [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang%27s_C_formula#Erlang_C_formula"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang%27s_C_formula#Erlang_C_f...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5216385"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5216385</a>",1360817608

MDMA alone changed my life, but what followed was how I utilized that moment of awareness that I experienced. I started meditating, read The Power of Now by Tolle, and having had enough of a philosophical and meditative foundation for understanding what Tolle was saying, I can occasionally enter a realm of understanding far beyond the shallow experiences I had lived in my life up to that point. It's so true when you say that reality is so much bigger than you think, because once you realize the ridiculous amount of depth that goes into every single thing around you (even the room your in contains materials built by dozens of people from across the world - think of how long it takes you to cook breakfast in the morning) then everything in your life begins to take on a sense of perspective.<p>That said, I really want to try mushrooms/acid because I feel like I'm at this midway point, bobbing back and forth between the awareness of meditation and the power of the present and slipping back into old thought habits and anxieties.

The democratization of knowledge to literally billions of people has given earth the potential to collaborate on big projects on a scale the never before seen.<p>Yeah... but the democratization of energy use has been similarly radical.<p>The problem I think that fission can solve is the near-term one;   we are running out of easy to exploit fossil fuels (and bumping against the long-term consequences of burning said fuels) right at a time when, well, the rest of the world is reaching an economic level where they want to start consuming energy the way we have been for some time.  It's hard to tell them ""No, you can't burn fossil fuels"" when they aren't any worse than we were when we were at that stage of development.<p>My point is just that we have good nuclear power technology that can be brought online to meet much of that need now, and that the resistance to that technology is largely political (and, I think, irrational and destructive to human life.)   Sure, we will eventually come up with something better, but meanwhile, those on the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder are dying and the rest of us are somewhat uncomfortable because we are continuing to use the ancient solution rather than the merely old solution to the energy problem.<p>I see several other problems, especially speaking as an American, well, if China has cheap nuclear power while we are still stuck in a largely fossil-fuel based economy, well, that's going to do things to the balance of power that I, as an American, won't like one bit.<p>And even that problem?  I think an ascendant China is better than a humanity plunged into a new dark age by irrational energy rationing.<p>So yeah, we have another problem here caused by our political resistance to nuclear power.   Why would you start researching another energy source if all evidence points to the fact that it will be rejected, even if it's safer than what is currently being used?<p>That's the thing, large amounts of energy are inherently dangerous by themselves.   Every new technology is going to have downsides.  If ""the people"" don't like fission, why do you think they will accept fusion or whatever new technology you come up with?",1360815671

In my experience in the audio world, the DAW-maker's rush makers to crank out features to the neglect of the functionality of their product has been simply horrific. I've used 4 of the top programs (ProTools, Sonar, Cubase, Logic) in paid sessions, and new releases of each one <i>always</i> leave old bugs unfixed as well as introduce new bugs, some of which are crippling. Each one of these programs cost over $500 (at the time they were used, Logic is less now, I believe but also the buggiest and most unstable.)

Maybe someday when all browsers have auto-update like Chrome it will absolutely make sense for everyone to focus their efforts on fixing bugs in the engine vs. writing workarounds. That is not the reality we live in today.<p>I mean, I could argue that people shouldn't work around iOS bugs and should instead apply for jobs at Apple and fix UIKit itself so that everyone can best benefit from their labor. But that's absolutely absurd. It's also more than a little unfair to judge members of the jquery team for not going into a project like WebKit that's <i>millions of lines of C++</i> and acting like they're coming up with excuses for ""not fixing bugs"". This is a symbiotic and healthy relationship, browser vendors benefit from groups like jquery that make those bugs livable <i>today</i> through workarounds so that their products can be more usable in the immediate and they can focus on the ""real"" fixes for the future.<p>And don't forget that there are people who are running old OSes that would require buying a new computer before being able to upgrade their browser.",1360814690

This adds up to 2774.<p>I started to include the pre-1980 numbers, but it became too tedious. From what I got so far, there have been 3606 commercial aviation related fatalities since 1970, and over 4656 fatalities total in US-located commercial aviation history.<p>Pan Am Flight 830 had 1 fatality due to a terrorist bomb, which I put in the non-9/11 column. I put EgyptAir Flight 990 as a suicide+murder (or accident) and not due to terrorism.<p>However, this excludes accidents from US carriers not in the US (Pan Am 1736 in Tenerife; 583 fatalities in 1977), and includes accidents from non-US carriers which took place in the US (Air Canada 797; 23 fatalities in 1983). I did it this way because you qualified it as ""in the US.""<p>Just under 3,000 fatalities occurred due to 9/11. The full statistical analysis would decrease the chance of death slightly to remove the 19 hijackers and observe that the same person could not be on all flights at the same time, reducing the count by about 150.

From 2002 to 2011 there were 11,068 aviation fatalities. This likely includes fatalities on the ground because it lists 4,140 fatalities for all of 2001, which is about 3000+(11068/10). I don't know how many of those other fatalities are due to terrorism.<p>Worldwide then, if you pick any period of three or more years, you are more likely to die by a plane accident than by terrorist attack. In the US, if you look at the last 40 years of flights, you are still more likely to die by accident than by terrorist attack.<p>For the usual sense of scale for these matters, there were 32,367 automobile deaths in the US in 2011, or 1.10 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled. Airlines have about 1 death for each 2,000 million miles traveled. (Neither of these statistics include non-traveler fatalities.)",1360814456

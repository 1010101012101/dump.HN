But, the second hit suggests 'tryptomine' is a no longer-issued drug, and there aren't the wide range of hits typical for the standard name of a currently-prescribed drug.<p>The amino acid tryptophan is available as an over-the-counter supplement in the US. It's often popularly blamed for post-Thanksgiving-dinner drowsiness, as it naturally occurs in turkey meat, but I recall seeing a debunking that the levels there are probably meaningless compared to other tiring rituals/portions of that traditional dinner.<p>In the US, prescriptions come with a long insert with tiny print with tons of drug information, and usually a smaller single-page larger-print insert mentioning the key dosage, side-effect, and counter-indications/incompatibility considerations.<p>It's also common for the prescribing doctor, and the separate pharmacist who usually 'fills' prescriptions, to add oral warnings about major considerations. These quite commonly include a ""don't drive after taking"" clause, or something to the effect of: ""this makes many people drowsy, get used to its effects for a few days before doing anything risky"".<p>Your point is well taken -- anyone given a new drug should learn as much about it as practical before taking it, from the person delivering it and other independent sources in print or via the web.",1289073127

And that&#x27;s good for starting, not so sure when you raise round A - a good one. If you have money to spend it&#x27;s probably better to move everyone to California. Don&#x27;t you think? \nHowever it&#x27;s true that the quality of life in Italy is a lot higher than the Bay Area, but you need to stop fighting the system or be part of it if you want to have a really good life. \nAbout your &quot;this kind of thing happens everywhere&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure you are right. At least not in the high tech hubs around the world. \nAnd again, do you think that Portland is like Italy? I&#x27;ve been there just a few times but my perception is completely different from the business point of view. When you are a tourist though, everything is fine pretty much everywhere.",1421323162

Unless your business is heavily unionised and full of 50somethings hired back in the &#x27;80s, there are umpteen ways to fire people, some of them even paid-for by the State. Not that anyone needs to actually fire anybody: most people nowadays are just contractors from day 1 and never really &quot;hired&quot; in the first place.<p>Recent changes in employment laws were introduced so that very large firms with a long-established unionised workforce (FIAT etc) will find it easy to break the unions&#x27; back for good. They will do nothing for medium and small firms, who will just keep using the contractor model.<p>(Of course, if you pocketed your workers&#x27; pension contributions for years, or did similar shenanigans behind their back counting on them behind happy to just get a paycheck month-in month-out, then you can&#x27;t fire them, because they will sue you and get a huge payout.

A Public Testing Server.. As obvious as it might seem, that&#x27;s something these money hungry developer&#x27;s either didn&#x27;t consider or just plain over looked due to costs.<p>There&#x27;s been a cheating problem since the beginning and there will always be a cheater problem because instead of investing in an actual anti-cheat (Their current one is FairFight and it records statistics, all in-game bans are done by hand.) I seriously recommend you not play this unless you plan on cheating yourself because that is the only way you&#x27;ll ever survive, unless you&#x27;re actually somewhat decent at FPS&#x27;s, which, in that case, be prepared to be banned at random times because a streamer or someone well known in the community said you cheated.<p>In the beginning, the developers stole their terms of service from League of Legends, banned people at random times to scare off cheaters (their version of an anti-cheat), and used fake screenshots which resulted in the game originally being pulled from steam. (Seriously.) It&#x27;s for some reason been allowed back onto steam, and I believe everyone should know of this games terrible past and know that it&#x27;s not changed one bit.

First time I hear about this but it certainly contains lots of things which make a lot of sense to me or which I do already myself and/or are backed up by reserach. Except the part of the squatting position :P<p>Not everybody accepts this though. Especially about point 2 and 3 I&#x27;ve had discussions, almost religious fights sometimes. People sometimes get offended when I question if just going to the gym and train a couple of standard groups or just jogging are sufficient exercises. They might be, just from the point of &#x27;getting enough exercise&#x27;, but I somehow believe it is better for your body in general to have way more types of movement trained, like the third point says. Not sure if this is backed up by research but it just seems logical to me? Another impression I have: the body of a person doing all kinds of sports always looks way more natural and healthy to me than persons doing only one or two sports where not all muscle groups are trained.",1421321941

For starters, OpenReach is vastly more tightly regulated (leading to, for example, all prices being publicly available on their website), but OpenReach is also subject to a <i>lot</i> of additional scrutiny and pressure from the 500+ companies that rely on their network to provide services, especially because many of said 500+ companies are directly competing with Virgin for business.<p>The baggage of BT is also less of an issue simply because while most ISPs uses OpenReach for their backhaul services (relying on OpenReach to provide an IP connection from the subscriber to the ISPs network), OpenReach also provide raw access where the ISP can put equipment in BTs exchanges and get a direct physical connection to the subscribers line, and a number of providers have and do make use of this to provide faster connections than what OpenReach offers for backhaul.<p>With LLU unbundling the only limitation provided by OpenReach is down to physical constraints of a network they inherited and was not endowed with enough cash to somehow instantly upgrade.<p>But most ISPs are not willing or able to cover the costs even of taking advantage of the LLU unbundling, which should illustrate that there really isn&#x27;t a willingness for most to pay for much faster rollouts of higher speeds.",1421321571

Suppose for a second that every school taught blacks to like that movie you referred to. You just created a (causal!!) proxy for race. So now if decisions pertaining to your future income are based on you having watched the movie, then all of a sudden they become pure of ideology?

What society looks like now is a result of yesterday&#x27;s politics, and what it will look like tomorrow is a result of today&#x27;s. You&#x27;re simply suggesting implementing conservative politics that <i>don&#x27;t</i> try to change society today.

But in my eyes that&#x27;s not really a problem of the translators, but rather of the tools we use. A long list of strings that have maybe only a vague context is a horribly UX for the translator. Who would fault them to translate »outline« as »Gliederung« in a word processing application? A string table is probably the most convenient format for programmers, but not very much so for those maintaining translations.<p>Qt gets a bit of this right. If the translator has access to the source code and uses Qt Linguist, at least the strings that are directly in .ui files are shown with a mock-up of the respective window where the control with that text is highlighted [0]. That already helps a lot with context errors. Of course, it does nothing for text in the source code, and so our translator went ahead and translated »Breite« (line width) with »latitude« because the application in question was, after all, related to maps, geography and GPS; it just happened to have a setting to change the width of certain lines, which, in German, then mapped to the same word.<p>Qt also has a nice way of handling plurals in that both Linguist and the QTranslator class are aware of the languages and the special rules concerning plural forms in them. You create a translatable string like »Searched %n directories« and then create translations for that. English, German and lots of others just map to two forms (1, rest). Russian gets three, I think (1/21/31/..., 2/22/32/..., 11/12/rest), and so on. Downside is that you only get to handle a single plural in a string [1], and you have to create an en→en translation as well (to account for multiple forms in the source language). But generally it&#x27;s a quite nice implementation. Gettext has something similar where you can write your own plural form matching rules somehow, but most translators I met don&#x27;t really want to write math.<p>Visual Studio with Windows Forms has a mode of creating the string tables for translation where you can just change the language in the Form&#x27;s properties and then proceed to change each control text. This nicely solves the context problem in that the translator edits the window directly and it looks like it normally does. But it also creates a whole bunch of other problems: Translators need VS, they need to edit the project directly and can accidentally mess up the UI with a mouse twitch when selecting a button to translate. They also might miss things that are buried in menus since there is no real measurement of completion and what&#x27;s still missing. I&#x27;ve seen various projects, especially in web environments adopt a similar custom-written approach, though, where you can edit the UI directly in the application to translate it. Still with the problem that translators might miss hard-to-find and buried strings (one might argue that you should get rid of buried and obscure places in your UI anyway, though).<p>Long ramblings ... it was a topic I considered for my Diploma thesis while studying. But I couldn&#x27;t think of a good way that could retain context for the translator in a general case, or at least most of the time. I thought about replacing each and every translatable string in a program with a custom identifier and then later trying to find those again via UI Automation or maybe screenshots and OCR to be able to map strings to parts of screenshots of the program. Would have required running the program once with those custom identifiers and once in normal mode and somehow matching up identifiered screenshots, normal screenshots and the string tables. And still with the problem that you&#x27;d need to manually go down each and every dialog and menu, including context menus, messages that only appear in certain states, etc.<p>Perhaps there just is no good solution, except maybe for developers to properly annotate each translatable string they use. In the »Breite«/»width«/»latitude« case I went through the source and added translator comments detailing the meaning of the word for every instance, but with large applications having thousands of translatable strings that could become unwieldy quickly.<p>__________<p>[0] <a href=""http://geoinformatics.fsv.cvut.cz/wiki/images/thumb/3/39/Qt_Linguist.png/900px-Qt_Linguist.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geoinformatics.fsv.cvut.cz/wiki/images/thumb/3/39/Qt_...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/5348990/73070"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/q/5348990/73070</a>",1421321497

It implies avoiding\n      all processed food, and in particular junk food and food with a\n      high glycemic load, such as sweets and cultivated crops like\n      potatoes and cereal grains (in particular wheat).\n    - Exercise frequently, but with a variety of durations and\n      intensities (including rest periods) rather than doing always\n      the same, extended routines in a gym or while jogging.\n    - Perform a variety of complex &quot;natural movements&quot; (e.g. walking,\n      running, jumping, crawling, climbing, carrying, throwing,\n      swimming) that use the whole body rather than artificially\n      constrained exercises that focus on specific muscles (like those\n      afforded by most gym equipment).\n    - Maximize contact with nature, e.g. by keeping plants, gardening,\n      working with animals, hiking in the woods, or climbing trees (as\n      also proposed by the biophilia philosophy).\n    - Use a minimum of clothes and don&#x27;t wear shoes: exposure to heat,\n      cold, pressure, and other natural forces strengthens rather than\n      weakens the body.\n    - Expose yourself regularly to the sun or at least to natural\n      light, to get sufficient vitamin D and prevent depression.\n    - Try to sleep at least 8 hours a day, preferably in line with\n      natural day-night rhythms (though people in pre-industrial\n      societies do not sleep in contiguous blocks - see anthropology\n      of sleep and segmented sleep).\n    - Spend sufficient time relaxing, playing, and just &quot;being in the\n      present&quot;, without worrying about later.\n    - Reduce overall levels of stress; avoid overworking in favor of\n      downshifting and simple living.\n    - Allow contact with dirt: soil contains plenty of beneficial\n      bacteria that strengthen immunity. Eat fermented foods like\n      sauerkraut, kim chi, kombucha, etc. Lifelong exposure to a\n      variety of microbes may actually be necessary to prevent\n      allergies and autoimmune diseases, as proposed by the hygiene\n      hypothesis.\n    - Rear children the way hunter-gatherers do: extended\n      breast-feeding, carrying of babies on the body, co-sleeping,\n      while allowing older children to play and explore\n      autonomously.\n    - Sit with legs level with rear end (essentially, in the squatting\n      position), as people in indigenous tribes do.\n    - Socialize and interact closely with a small group of real\n      friends, instead of staying alone or &quot;networking&quot; with thousands\n      of superficial acquaintances.\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_lifestyle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_lifestyle</a>",1421319949

On the other hand, there are other elements in the administration, notably in the Department of Defense, which are beginning to try to invent a blueprint and map out the capacities in order to have the United States undertake this task alone.</i><p>As you note, the DoD took over this role. But it wasn&#x27;t because of lack of interest of State.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cfr.org/iraq/council-expert-says-state-department-pentagon-odds-over-postwar-iraq-policy-asserts/p5776"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfr.org/iraq/council-expert-says-state-department...</a>",1421319722

Our heat dissipation system is better than most animals, so it works better when it&#x27;s hot. It&#x27;s possible to do it alone, and hunt big animals with only a knife to kill them in the end, if you know what you&#x27;re doing. However, it means you have to move for a long time.",1421319704

There&#x27;s a very real possibility that the same municipal governments that granted the cable monopolies in the first place, will either license the network to an ISP that will either become Comcast-like (monopoly lazyness does that), be bought by Comcast or actually just simply is Comcast (remember, the municipalities have a &quot;good working relationship&quot; with Comcast) or they will setup their own ISP, which might get off to a decent start, but will either make money, and then go on to be milked hard, or it will lose money, and will have to fight with the fire service and the water utility over every last penny for infrastructure upgrades (&quot;What do you mean you need a $5000 router?

But at the margin, it&#x27;s more difficult, so if you have the chance, you should go elsewhere: I think Italy should get its own house a bit more in order before trying to attract people from other countries.  They&#x27;ll come naturally if Italy is a decent place to do business.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect, because it has so many other nice things, it just has to suck less: California, for instance, is not the best US state to do business in, in terms of bureaucracy and taxation.",1421319662

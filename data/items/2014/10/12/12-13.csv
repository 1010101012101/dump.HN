Text books are needlessly expensive and, to be honest, often superficial content-wise. The information contained in them can be easily gotten from the Internet or, if that doesn&#x27;t work out, from a good library.<p>But even if I&#x27;d want to use 10 text books at the same time, one kindle isn&#x27;t going to cut it. I think the biggest problem with using digital documents, for me, is that there&#x27;s no natural geometrical mapping that I can keep in my head the way I can with books, articles, and stuff scattered around my office. I know that the information on concept A is in that corner, for example, and that going deeper into that pile means going in deeper chronologically. And I put documents on related concepts closer to each other. Somehow, these stacks of documents form a concrete representation of the argument I am constructing.<p>I tried to do the same with digital documents, I&#x27;ve got thousands of them, but tagging them, or putting them in directory trees, and so on, does not give me the same handle on the the information as I understand it at this moment in my mind. It is quite frustratingly, as digital documents are a lot easier to handle otherwise.",1413118238

For each of these nodes, you have the amplitude of the DFT, but not the phases. However, performing a brute force attack on the phase space is likely relatively easy, because it would normally be relatively small. An attacker could fix the values of all phases except one (phase_i), and then find, using the simplex algorithm, the next value of cos(phase_i) or sin(phase_i) that changes one of the time-domain values to round to the next output value. For each value of phase_i, the attacker then recursively repeats the attack for phase_{i+1}, until all passwords for the amplitude vector on the node are enumerated.<p>These passwords are then used to brute force attack the system. If one password is extremely common in the SOM, that common password should be in the resulting list.",1413118052

SARS is especially easy to transmit from one person to another because it is an airborne virus. No doubt there will be other cases of ebola infection spreading in the developed world, even in hospital settings, now that the first few cases have been discovered. But SARS transmission decreased a lot once people in China started taking precautions like self-isolation and masks to cover coughs. West Africa has a lower availability of equipment, supplies, trained personnel, and even information today than rural China had in 2003, but with sufficient outside help the transmission of ebola can also decrease a lot, until numbers of new cases start falling instead of rising.",1413117996

Can you imagine writing a program using string templating rather than functions, objects and libraries?   Sure, it would be possible, but it would be rather awkward...<p>The closest I&#x27;ve seen to what I want is DRYML:  <a href=""http://hobocentral.net/manual/dryml-guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hobocentral.net/manual/dryml-guide</a><p>The big advantage of DRYML over systems like React & builders is that it has a really nice story for customization.   Rather than customizing just through XML attributes, it also has a system for passing in snippets through XML children.  But not just snippets for the top component, but but snippets for children of the components you&#x27;re instantiating.<p>This has huge advantages for reusability.   There are millions of jQuery widgets out there.   How come you never use any of them?   They never fit the style, behaviour nor requirements of your app.   Yet on the server side, you pull in tens of gems, npms, etc from random authors.<p>DRYML allows customization in both the small and the large.   It works well for both defining and customizing <a> tags as well as huge custom components.   That huge custom component will use your customized <a> etc, so it automatically picks up your theme and behavior.<p>DRYML has some major disadvantages though:  it&#x27;s really nice to use, but defining new components looks like line noise.  It&#x27;s also tied to a heavyweight, lightly used framework for Ruby on Rails called Hobo.<p>One of my many projects abandoned due to lack of time is a port of DRYML&#x27;s &quot;standard library&quot; Rapid to React.   React isn&#x27;t quite as nice as DRYML for re-use and customization, but it has a large number of advantages in popularity, speed and readability.

Personally, I just want to be in control of my data, and don&#x27;t want others (government or otherwise) to be indexing or 2 clicks away from my data.<p>As you mention, hosting OwnCloud removes your cat/fire scenario. Even by hosting it at a US ISP, you are significantly reducing the likelihood that the government can index or be two clicks away from your data, and your host (unlike Google/Dropbox) isn&#x27;t likely to be mining your data for future business models.  Hosting it at an ISP in a country that respects individuals privacy (e.g. Iceland) means your data won&#x27;t be in the government&#x27;s hands unless you&#x27;re directly targeted by a state actor.<p>A subset of the features is, for me, an advantage.

However, it&#x27;s a problem that both in Texas and Spain, the people infected have been health workers. Health workers that are supposedly well-protected and well-informed about Ebola specifically (at least the spanish nurse was, it&#x27;s not clear in this case yet).<p>Now it&#x27;s true that there are more bodily fluids in a hospital than outside, but given all the protection and procedures, is the difference so big that a health worker is at a much bigger risk than a person who happen to sit next to someone infected on a bus?<p>There are two cases as I see it. Either it&#x27;s likely that other people, non-health workers, have been infected. We just don&#x27;t know about it yet, or it has been decided that it&#x27;s not in the public&#x27;s interest to know. Or the protective measures are so bad, the disease so misunderstood or hard to protect against, that health workers effectively can&#x27;t protect themselves against the risk.<p>Either case, it&#x27;s a big problem.

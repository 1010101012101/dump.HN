Thinner, lighter, longer battery life are consistent with these strengths. Microsoft is going in the opposite direction with Surface Pro: thicker, heavier, and shorter battery life.

The reason that there should be billions of years left is just a statement about probability.  Given that the universe has already lasted for billions of years, it would be very unlikely for it to end tomorrow (in fact the odds would be about one in a trillion).

5249037,comment,5248544,5248910,4,0,spamizbad,,,"The rhetoric I heard from both my parents, my teachers, and my guidance consoler during my junior and senior year in high school (2000-2001) was ""Employers want a college degree. It doesn't matter <i>what</i> degree you get, unless you want to do STEM, so pick something that interests you. College really just signals to an employer that you 'know how to learn.'""<p>The first part is mostly true: employers want a college degree. The second part is also true: STEM (with the exception of software development) tends to prefer people with specific degrees. The third part, however, is total bullshit, and it got A LOT of people into a A LOT of debt. The reality is employers are incredibly picky not just over a candidate's degree, but these days they're much less willing to invest in employee training. They want candidates who can show up and do the job on day 1.<p>My hunch is that lot of the college advice was doled out to students based upon the Baby Boomer's understanding of the world: College degrees are a hot item employers want, and they (usually) don't care what it's in! The employer will train you at your job and you just need the necessary reading, writing, and math skills. This probably was the case in the 1960s, 70s, and early 80s but by the 90s things had changed.<p>(As an aside- I ended up dropping out of college after 1.5 years and avoided debt. Opportunity knocked and probably saved me from tons of debt).",1361336083

Mapping out a real life location and allowing people to run through with weapons in a game could end up in instances where little Johnny who is suffering from a mental illness and likes games finds himself heading to the train station and recreating the game in real life because his view on reality has been distorted. I can however see how this situation is ridiculous. What's to say that if someone were to shoot up the train station that they weren't going to do it anyway? People who end up publicly ambushing people with guns aren't usually trained in combat so there is no tactical attribute associated with the scenario and it's not like the game is displaying messages along the lines of, ""Hey! this is a good level to practice a public shooting in"" or ""If you wait at the top of the escalator you can blow people up down the bottom with grenades""<p>This whole thing is no different than GTA teaching people to run down hookers and ramming police cars off the road or a flight simulator causing someone to fly a jumbo jet into the Eiffel Tower.

I use GitHub because we use it at work and because I found it first.  BitBucket now supports git repos, which might make it a contender.

As an artist, you would have an extremely hard time finding a client / employer who cares if you even graduated from high school or learned to tie your shoes, as long as they like what's in your portfolio.<p>That being said, anything remotely related to art is going to be highly competitive, because no one really retires from being an artist, and there lots of people who have 30+ years of experience.",1361334902

5248899,comment,5244192,5247627,1,0,pseut,,,"We're talking past each other; a few points, though :).  The content dissemination part of these MOOCs isn't new.  You can get short lectures by VHS tape.  Most classroom lectures are watered down versions of the textbooks/research monographs.  PBS has had objectively fantastic educational content (not saying that all of their ed. content is fantastic, just that some of it is) for decades.  It was before my time, but I think that people were initially most excited about the educational possibilities of TV, so, a priori, there's been comparable <i>potential</i> impact before.<p>What's (probably) new is the ease of entry and the communication & coordination between students and instructors.<p>The low completion rates aren't necessarily red herrings; these are students that are self-selecting into online classes, so they're probably more comfortable with computers than most other students.  They're also choosing classes that are particularly well suited to online instruction.  So it goes both ways.<p>If you have links, data, whatever, please share it.   Otherwise it looks like you're giving your anecdotes and opinion some sort of privileged status and I'm sure you don't mean to do that.  I still don't know what point you think the article you linked to makes or refutes.  And the original editorial makes two recommendations:<p><i>""Colleges need to improve online courses before they deploy them widely. Moreover, schools with high numbers of students needing remedial education should consider requiring at least some students to demonstrate success in traditional classes before allowing them to take online courses.""</i><p>What's wrong with those recommendations?<p>As I've mentioned elsewhere in these comments, you'd probably consider me to be part of the ""vested interests of our current education system"" since I teach at a university.  I'd bet, though, that the deans and university administrators of the world are short sighted enough to think that they're going to benefit from this direction in education (they like to cut costs).  Most faculty are too busy to pay much attention.  The only ""insiders"" that I'm sure are on top of this are the textbook publishers and standardized testing organizations, and they're pretty flexible about their revenue streams.",1361333596

While he did not expect to be able to match the large American nuclear arsenal, Mao believed that even a few bombs would increase China's diplomatic credibility. Construction of uranium enrichment plants in Baotou and Lanzhou began in 1958, and a plutonium facility in Jiuquan and the Lop Nur nuclear test site by 1960. <i>The Soviet Union provided assistance in the early Chinese program by sending advisers to help in the facilities devoted to fissile material production, and promised to provide a prototype bomb.</i>[12] In July 1960, however, during the Sino-Soviet split, all Soviet assistance with the Chinese nuclear program was abruptly terminated and all Soviet technicians were withdrawn from the program.[13]",1361332858

I don't think it's safe to rely on truncation under the Canadian postal system.

It'd be nice to at least have some control over what kinds of searches I'm doing. For example, if I search for my own name, what I want to know is something like: what are the most common search results <i>other people</i> get when they search for my name. The same is usually true if I'm doing ""related work"" type searching for research; I explicitly want to find stuff outside my immediate area of specialization, in order to make sure I'm not missing anything that other people would've expected me to cover.",1308581129

""<i>Egypt</i>"" does not mean anything, other than the name of a country, and different people mean different things. When you're searching for ""<i>Egypt</i>"" and want to get travel tips, if you don't get them you can always expand your query to ""<i>Egypt travelling tips</i>"". But even that is a pretty shallow request and you can further expand it like ""<i>Egypt travel guide to the pyramids</i>"".<p>The search engine's job is to find what I'm looking for.

It was only later when I decided I needed to be able to perform this operation hundreds of times and produce tabular output to show a visible matrix of results that the failures of that approach became obvious.""<p>This reminds me of an approach I took on a recent project, where I wrote a variety of ultra-simple routines to look up very specific numbers and results.  These routines would often go out and fetch a rather large file of data, and crunch that data down to the single result the caller desired.  All in all, it was a <i>highly</i> inefficient way to do things.  However, it was not a problem, because all I had to do was drop in a few caches here and there inside the routines, and voila, the whole thing became fast enough.<p>I found it a very liberating approach, because all of my code looked very ""obvious"" in its logic.  In a few scattered places you see a couple lines of code to look something up in the cache first, but then it drops down into the ordinary and extremely clear logic.<p>The code also had a very nice ""lazy"", ""on-demand"", and decentralized feel to it, with no need for a bunch of gnarly and centralized initialization code.",1308580223

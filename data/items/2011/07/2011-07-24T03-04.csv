2798567,comment,2796314,2796314,1,0,rdl,,,"I'm driven by (roughly in this order):
1) Desire to have a minimum standard of living (basically, $100-200k in the bay area); you could get this from a lot of sources beyond entrepreneurship.  Also, safety (physical, employment even if a startup fails, etc.).  This is basically ""satisficed""; $100k and $300k are obviously different, but the annual salary difference isn't 3x improvement.  Say it is sublinear.
2) Desire to change the world (this can scale, and is almost superlinear; making a major positive change is worth more than a few smaller changes)<p>I think ""huge wealth"" (>$10mm personal exit, etc.) goes into the latter category, since it lets you influence a lot of things, including other startups.  Smaller wealth is more like a personal annuity, so if the alternative were not having a job at all, it would be important, but it's easy enough to get a great job in the bay area even if you don't have $2mm in the bank.",1311479588

That's the essence of Rubin's strong dollar policy in general, and our interactions with China in particular.<p>The only drawback is that you build up a big imbalance (in this case in the form of zero personal savings plus noticeable interest payments on the national debt).  That's not really a sustainable situation; the only question is when and why and how things will change.  <a href=""http://mpettis.com/2011/07/current-account-dilemma/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mpettis.com/2011/07/current-account-dilemma/</a> has some discussion on this.  The US may well have an interest in somewhat controlling how the imbalance is unwound when it unwinds.<p>Changing the trade balance unilaterally from the US point of view is somewhat difficult if China is really insistent on maintaining it.  We can impose tariffs (though we'd have to sell them to the WTO) and we can try to get China to stop messing with the exchange rate, but all China has to do is subsidize its exporters enough to overcome those issues (e.g. give them enough money that they can give US consumers large post-purchase rebates that are larger than the tariff amount).  The only way to really prevent that is to either ban those imports altogether or to make the required subsidy more painful than China is willing to do... or to convince the Chinese authorities that doing what they're doing is stupid.  Which is hard, because they're doing rational things that help them stay in power, and to hell with what will happen to the Chinese economy in 10-15 years.",1311478688

Flickr used to get yelled at for not catching the photo stealers or porn spammers faster.<p>Its so fucking easy, theyre right over there, here, let me show them to you, whats your problem?<p>This comes from not understanding the cost benefit ratio of false positives in identifying abuse of a social site at scale.<p>Imagine youve got a near perfect model for detecting spammers on Twitter. Say, Joes perfectly reasonable model of 20+ tweets that matched ^@[\w]+ <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> >> <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/joestump/status/94845660163088384"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/joestump/status/94845660163088384</a>. Joe is (presumably hyperbolically) claiming 99% accuracy for his model. And for the moment well imagine he is right. Even at 99% accuracy, that means this algorithm is going to be incorrectly flagging roughly 2 million tweets per day as spam that are actually perfectly legitimate.<p>If youve never run a social software site (which Joe of course has, but for the folks who havent) let me tell you: these kinds of false positives are expensive.<p>Theyre really expensive. They burn your most precious resources when running a startup: good will, and time. Your support staff has to address the issues (while people are yelling at them), your engineers are in the database mucking about with columns, until they finally break down about build an unbanning tool which inevitably doesnt scale to really massive attacks, or new interesting attack vectors, which means youre either back monkeying with the live databases or youve now got a team of engineers dedicated just to building tools to remediate false positives. And now youre burning engineer cycles, engineering motivation (cleaning up mistakes sucks), staff satisfaction AND community good will. Thats the definition of expensive.<p>And this is all a TON of work.<p>And while this is all going down youve got another part of your company dedicated to making creating new accounts AS EASY AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. Which means when you do find and nuke a real spammer, theyre back in minutes. So now youre waging asymmetric warfare AGAINST YOURSELF.<p>Fine, fine, fine whatever. Youll build a better model. You know, this is a social site, well use social signals. People can click and say This is spam and then when, I dont know, 10 people say a tweet is spam, well delete it and ban that account. But you know, people are fuckwits, and people are confused, and people are unpredictable and the scope of human activity at scale is amazingly wide and vast and deep, so a simple additive, easy to explain, fundamentally fair model isnt going to work. (protip: if youre site is growing quickly, make sure to use variables for those threshold numbers, otherwise you might DOS yourself)<p>But youre smart, so now youve got a machine learning model, thats feeding social signals into a real time engine, thats bubbling up the top 0.01% of suspicious cases (and btw if youve gotten this far, youre really really good, and youre probably wasting your time on whatever silly sheep poking/nerd herding site youre working on, so call me, Ive got something more meaningful for you to do), and in at least Twitters case were now talking about a mere 200,000 potential spam tweets to be manually reviewed daily.<p>How many people do you need to review 200k spam tweets per day? How many desks do they need? Are you doing to do that in house or are you going to outsource it? And if you outsource it, how are you going to explain the cultural peculiarities of your community, because while your product might have gone global, youre still your own funky nation of behavior, and some things that look strange (say, retweeting every mention of your own name >> <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/davemcclure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/davemcclure</a>) are actual part of your community norm.<p>And if you dont explain those peculiarities, how long do you think it is until this small army youve assembled to review 200k tweets a day, gets tired, makes a mistake and accidentally deletes one of your social network hub early adopter types (because the sad truth is early adopters are outliers in the data, and they look funny).<p>And what do you think the operational cost of making that mistake is? (see also: fakesters >> <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=fakesters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=fakesters</a>)<p>Also, whats your data recovery strategy look like on a per account basis?<p>There are solutions. Some of them are straightforward. Many of them arent. None of them are as easy as you think they are unless youve been there. And Im happy to talk to you about them over a beer, but just posting them on a blog, well that would be telling other peoples secrets.

It's still a logical fallacy to assume that <i>""rite of passage""</i> means <i>""this is the only way to proceed""</i>.  It's just an event that marks an important stage in someone's life.<p>There are lots of different rites of passage in every culture/subculture, and most people ignore most of them.  If you're atheist, is it ""insulting"" that Jewish kids have Bar/Bat Mitzvahs?",1311477421

Even well researched articles will stake out a position on an open issue and thereby spark debate.<p>Second, the writing in the the techpress often lacks any depth of analysis (something which often could be said of journalism in general) and is often based on an original communication which was intended to produce buzz or create spin - e.g. press releases, product announcements, etc.<p>In addition [ok it is more than a couple of things], often the criticism will be of an apparent bias or questionable level of objectivity on the part of the author.",1311477177

(I know because I was a pretty good test taker as a student, but the laziness and procrastination that it fosters is really starting to bite me in the ass right now) I think tests are useful because they're an easy metric, but if you're goal is to teach or learn a skill, tests are a really poor tool.  
As a thought experiment, if you wanted to teach yourself something what would you do? You probably wouldn't do it by giving yourself written tests.",1311476790

9503494,comment,9500643,9502561,0,0,MCRed,,,"This alone tells me that they don&#x27;t know what they are doing.<p>I interviewed for a job using Hacker Rank about 6 months ago.  They insisted that I complete their problems.  The problems were trivially easy (that&#x27;s ok, there was a time limit so you don&#x27;t want to make things too confusing or difficult) but I struggled and barely got it in on time due to how terrible the HackerRank system worked.  I ran into innumerable bugs, from not compiling the code correctly (poor install of the language) to front and bugs that would cause edits to be lost -- I eventually started coding in a text editor and copy and pasting the results in to submit-- but that didn&#x27;t work very well either, possible because they have an anti-cheat system or something.<p>I literally spent 5 minutes writing a solution to one of the answers, 1 minute running it locally (worked the first time) and then 20 minutes trying to get Hacker Rank to accept it.  Some of them it never accepted-- the code would be there but I couldn&#x27;t get the hacker rank system to run it to check its output.<p>Of course, the &quot;scoring&quot; on hacker rank is how fast you are and whether you get the correct output-- and this company explicitly stated that they rank people by score.  This was the only &quot;technical&quot; part of the interview process.<p>Of course I told them about the issues I ran into but at some point that&#x27;s going to sound like complaining, right?<p>So, now, I take outsourcing technical interviews to hacker rank as a sign of incompetence.<p>IF the hiring manager isn&#x27;t technical enough to conduct a technical interview, then your company is not competently managed.  PERIOD.<p>And hacker rank was such a joke that it shows they didn&#x27;t even try it themselves.",1430978158

9503479,comment,9501112,9502719,0,0,yesbabyyes,,,"First off, I agree. It was rude and when I wrote it I was in a bad mood in general. I think the ensuing discussion is definitely worth my karma hit; I&#x27;m a little bit sorry that you had to receive that aggressiveness, but reading your response I have hope it&#x27;s ok.<p>What I felt when I read your post, and wrote my response, was not so much about you as about an attitude that I&#x27;m fed up with, which is basically &quot;I can see how this system isn&#x27;t working out, but I&#x27;m participating anyway because it treats me pretty good&quot;. And as you say, and others in this thread, there is something - an ideology, a rationalization or a truth - which excuses if not condones this.<p>I don&#x27;t buy that coffee, I brew my own, and always buy eco and fairtrade. I know and agree that this isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> working out either, but it&#x27;s a start, and a &quot;market signal&quot; or whatever. Thing is, I&#x27;ve been to those coffee and cocoa plantations and guess what - things aren&#x27;t working out for the people working there, either.<p>When it comes to the electronics, I&#x27;m painfully aware of the fact that the rare minerals are often mined by actual slaves, under gunpoint. What is probably the worst war since WWII is basically about minerals for smartphones, it&#x27;s in The Congo[1] and has claimed millions of lives. All the while some of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people are laughing and smiling about their billion dollar profits. So I don&#x27;t get a new phone all the time. I have a Geeksphone Peak, for the record. Still, it needs cobalt and coltan and tin which might well have been mined by children, literally with their hands.<p>What javert says about choosing to work there just isn&#x27;t that simple. What branchless says further down the thread is; it&#x27;s about access to land. And those people working factories in China were removed from their land in agricultural reforms. It&#x27;s a political thing and it has happened all over the world; see e.g. The Enclosure[2] in Britain.<p>This isn&#x27;t simple at all, but since it&#x27;s a market economy where all decisions are ultimately made by the &quot;consumer&quot;, which is us in the context of this discussion, we have to make the right choices. And if we have the information, we can&#x27;t just disregard that with &quot;hey, at least it&#x27;s a job&quot;. That&#x27;s what bothers me the most about this; a lot of people just don&#x27;t have the information to make the right choices. If the people who have the information, and the wealth, to make better choices don&#x27;t, then we&#x27;re doomed.<p>I realize how this will come through all high and mighty, but I think it&#x27;s worth it to get a clear message across. The idea behind the market economy is that we organize ourselves according to every individual decision. In that case, it&#x27;s up to everyone to make the best choice, using <i>all</i> available information. You can&#x27;t have the cake and eat it.<p>If you don&#x27;t agree with how Uber operates as a company, don&#x27;t do business with them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congolese_Civil_War"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congolese_Civil_War</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure</a><p>Edit: Spelling.",1430977930

Essentially all new languages have them, Java and C++ retrofit them.<p>(ii) Lazy evaluation order by default: mostly dead. All new language use eager evaluation, even SPJ is sceptical that lazy evaluation should be the default. Scala has an interesting approach: eager by default, but you can switch to CBN (although not full laziness) if required. This hybrid form enables you to define control-operators easily, while keeping the simplicity and efficiency of eager evaluation. Exceptions are\nlanguages with dependent types that are really theorem provers (e.g. Agda).<p>(iii) Purity: dead. All new languages have side-effects. The widely used FP languages like Haskell, Ocaml and F# have side-effects. Exceptions are\nlanguages with dependent types for Curry-Howard-based theorem provers (e.g. Agda), because there is no convincing Curry-Howard correspondence using state.<p>(iv) Everything is function application: open. This may work reasonably well in purely sequential languages, but there are theoretical reasons to believe that message passing is not function application (while function application is a special case of message passing).<p>(v) Types. The answer on this one depends on whether one is a proponent of statically typed languages or not, clearly an unresolved question. For dynamically typed languages, the question is moot, so the rest of the discussion is irrelevant to those who think that static typing is a bad idea.<p>(vi) Types (1), type inference: Slam dunk winner. All new languages have inference or wish they could have it but don&#x27;t know  how to do it (Scala). There are probably some hard trade-offs between expressivity of types and efficient decidability of type inference (B Pierce termed Hindley-Milner a &quot;sweet spot&quot;), so we might have to tolerate some type annotation being required, e.g. in local or bidirectional inference.<p>(vii) Types (2), algebraic data types, pattern matching: winner. Most new languages have them in some form.<p>(viii) Types (3), monadic encapsulation of effects: open. Most new languages have not yet embraced this. Some conceptual problems not yet solved, e.g. destructors for state monads. There are also expressivity problems, e.g. not all effects can easily be expressed as monads, and composition of monads doesn&#x27;t always work as desired. Moreover there are pragmatic questions about whether monadic encapsulation should be required or optional.<p>(ix) Types (4), higher-kinded types: open. Not all new languages have them, but HKTs are generally considered useful, but not super important, cf Rust&#x27;s evolution. If monadic encapsulation of effects is used, then HKTs become highly desirable, cf the recent Scala fork.<p><pre><code>   --------------------\n</code></pre>\nAny other suggestions?",1430977030

In fact, had Mulcair (the federal NDP leader) endorsed the Alberta NDP party it probably would have cost them a lot of votes. He is remembered for demonizing Alberta to cozy up to Quebec voters in the last federal election and remains wildly unpopular in Alberta.<p>Prentice and the Alberta PC&#x27;s made a litany of key mistakes in rapid succession. Perhaps foremost was flouting their own legislation that &quot;guaranteed&quot; fixed election dates... <i>again</i>.  Why was it too much this time?  The PC&#x27;s had just cut the head off the official opposition party by luring their leader (along with half it&#x27;s MLA&#x27;s) across the floor.  While Prentice claimed he needed a new mandate for his budget, the true reason for this election&#x27;s timing was obvious.  They thought it would be a cakewalk because their opposition was in complete disarray. This is exactly the kind of election manipulation their own law was <i>supposed</i> to discourage.<p>The reason the NDP won the election is because voters had decided on &quot;anyone but the PC&#x27;s&quot; and Rachel Notley was the only leader who didn&#x27;t look like a clown in the leader&#x27;s debate. Alberta isn&#x27;t afraid of big-spending governments because that&#x27;s precisely what the PC&#x27;s were. They also expect the NDP to become a much more centrist, business friendly party now that they&#x27;re in power.  Mulcair might be walking with a bounce in his step right now, but he&#x27;s going to be choking down a lot of sour news about what passes for NDP policy in the West soon enough.<p>As for federal politics...  Harper has now been in power long enough that the West has gotten over feeling giddy about actually mattering in federal politics.  A different party with a sound policy and a good leader could easily win a lot of ridings here if they took the province seriously.  That means no nepotism, especially regarding the son of a leader famous for flipping the province the bird while riding right on through to the next province on the train.  That means no parties that are too afraid to announce their platform.  That means no parties that run garbage candidates.  (In the last federal election, the NDP ran a grocery clerk from the other end of the province in my riding.  She had never been to my city and refused to speak to media.  She was nothing more than a name on a ballot.)  No federal party that demonizes Alberta as a way of attacking Harper&#x27;s background (even though he&#x27;s from Toronto) is going to get a lot of votes here.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d just like to add that the <i>liberals</i> voted with the PC&#x27;s to pass this bill.  The NDP get no credit for opposing the bill because they&#x27;d oppose practically <i>anything</i> the other two parties were for.",1430976197

Carriers are required to publish their rate schedules and surcharges and jointly announce rate increases 30 days in advance of the effective date.<p>They also share service strings, so a weekly Transpacific service may have a rotation of five different vessels from different carriers, who lease each other container space. They are officially not allowed to restrict supply in a coordinated fashion to prop up prices anymore, but they have to jointly make operational decisions to downsize or cancel service strings, which is effectively the same thing.<p>The result of this, along with numerous government and private bailouts, is that many of these perennially loss-making companies with inefficient operations and terrible service continue to limp along and slowly bleed shareholder value, whereas in a free market they would have been bankrupted and their assets liquidated years ago.",1430975322

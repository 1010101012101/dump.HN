282793,comment,282509,282647,0,0,edw519,,,"Sure.<p>This is the exact same strategy that got the PC into the enterprise.  At first, IT departments wanted nothing to do with them and considered them ""toys"".  If you needed anything, they insisted you go through them (and wait).<p>With the invention of the IBM PC and Visicalc, accounting departments bypassed IT and bought their own PCs using their own budgets.  Fortunately, the cost was low enough to be under the radar.  Several years later, IT had no choice but to accomdate PCs and real user needs into their plans.<p>History is repeating with web apps.  There's nothing to stop you from finding a user or entire department that needs an app and isn't getting what they need from their own IT department.<p>Just sell directly to the end user.  They have plenty of desire and budget to bypass IT once again.",1219334340

In fact, it confuses more than it helps.<p>Want a good checklist of what agile is? Try <a href=""http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2008/04/the_agile_check.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2008/04/the_agile_che...</a><p>Or:<p><pre><code>    * Adapt - Always ask yourself what is wrong and what you need to do to fix it. If you continuously communicate to identify problems and fix them, I believe that in a normal world you will do the following things that I can observe:\n\n    * Time-Box - You have a fixed, immutable time-box in which you deliver tested changes (either code, documents, processes, beans, whatever) that be demonstrated\n\n    * Togetherness - The closer everybody is, the better. Co-located, non-cubicle, non-office spaces are best. Highly matrixed, separated teams are worst.\n\n    * Value - You have a clear way of determining the most valueable thing to do each iteration. Business Owners give you business value. Technical Owners give you architectural value.\n\n    * Ownership - The team, and only the team, owns its estimates. Outside factors are considered and can be communicated, but at the end of the day the team has the power to determine the amount and type of work it can take on for each iteration.\n\n    * Forecast - Being agile and empirical does not preclude precictability or forecasting. In fact, the value of agile teams is their ability to take highly-changing environments and put some kind of predictable forecastable order in them.</code></pre>",1219334092

282786,comment,282727,282727,0,0,ajross,,,"Honestly, I think this is exactly backwards.  The voodoo juice in ""agile"" comes from the mindset, and <i>not</i> the specific practices.  The mindset is encapsulated pretty well by the manifesto, IMHO.  Could someone write a better one?  Maybe.<p>But if you want to know what agile is all about, read the manifesto.  Decades of experience in XP, *DD, AUP, etc... isn't going to teach you much about the ""why"" of those paradigms.  If I were an agile proponent (and I'm really not) interviewing a candidate, I'd want to know that they can explain the handful of ideas in the manifesto.

It's trying to give a step-by-step approach to something that is individually hard.  But maybe this entrepreneur has found a niche - providing a 'inspiration of the day'-type post. The large number of comments that each blog post gets really emphasizes the fact that its found an audience that is looking for content of this sort ('10 ways to X', 'How to X'). I'm starting to see other blogs copy its format too - down to the pretty Flickr picture that leads every post.<p>Inspiration is good but inspiration is external-based.

To call an enemy a ""m~"" is to accuse him of incest, hitting on one of humanity's oldest taboos. To describe oneself as a ""badass m~"" is, often, to threaten seduction or rape against others' mothers-- in other words, to dress oneself as a dangerous and indiscriminate sociopath.<p>It's probably one of the most intrinsically ugly words in the language. Racial slurs are ugly because of what they represent-- hideous and unacceptable attitudes held against innocent people, based in prejudice and ignorance-- but not on account of composition, because they're usually atomic words. These words become extremely offensive once one knows their meanings, but beforehand hold no special currency. By contrast, ""M~"" is a compound of two well-known and fairly innocuous words-- one completely acceptable, one edgy but mostly inoffensive-- that instantly makes the skin of even most liberal people crawl, even before its semantic subtleties are explored.",1219331600

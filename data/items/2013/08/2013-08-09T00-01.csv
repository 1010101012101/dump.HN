If it&#x27;s important enough to developers and genuinely impacts their product (aka products Apple benefits from in more ways than one) they know it will effect the relationship they have with Apple. Like with anything however, the problem needs to communicated. The more people who communicate the same issue, the more likely it will get attention. <a href=""https://bugreport.apple.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugreport.apple.com/</a> is the place to start. Not blogs, not HN, not Twitter or anything else.<p>If you want a problem you&#x27;re having solved, start with filing a report in as detailed, and polite, a way as possible. Using blogs to bitch and complain about how Apple is ignoring an &quot;obvious&quot; issue, or how stupid they were to do things in such-and-such a way, is essentially counterproductive and being part of the problem rather than the solution. Using them to explain the issue, get a discussion around it going, coming up with solutions that work for you and fellow developers, and get additional reports filed, enhances the ability for Apple to respond with a genuine solution sooner rather than later. Sometimes they see the blogs and articles, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more often they don&#x27;t, so the trend I&#x27;ve seen over the last several years of vitriolic blogs being the first and only mention of a problem has, IMHO, really been disservice to the whole community.<p>It&#x27;s always taken much longer than I would personally like or understand, but with enough bug reports filed on a given issue I do see traction and changes come later on down the road. They may not always be the changes I explicitly requested or expect, but they do resolve the problems in one way or another.<p>edit: grammar",1376009868

That&#x27;s right on par with Walmart&#x27;s sales to net income ratio, and I believe Amazon accomplished that without much focus on profitability.<p>The only concern I see about Amazon as a company, is the future stock market returns for the next decade are already baked into the stock. They&#x27;re currently trading at three times the value of Target (with none of the profit, no dividend, and soon to be comparable sales).",1376008642
6182972,comment,6168885,6170036,2,0,el_bhs,,,"Sure.<p>So, for any black-box service endpoint, the latency for any given request is obviously just the time it takes for that operation to complete. Ideally one measures both end-to-end latency from the client and server-side latency in order to understand the impact of the network and, for high-throughput applications, any kernel buffering that takes place.<p>All of that is obvious, I imagine. By &quot;high-percentile latency&quot;, I&#x27;m referring to percentiles of a <i>distribution</i> of all latency measurements gathered from a given endpoint over some period of time. If you imagine that distribution as a frequency histogram, the horizontal axis ends up being buckets of latency ranges (e.g., 0-10ms, 10-20ms, 20-30ms, etc), and the bars themselves of course represent the number of samples in each such bucket. What we want to do is determine <i>which bucket</i> contains the 95th percentile (or 99th, or 99.9th) latency value.<p>You can see such a latency distribution on page 10 of this paper which I published while at Google:<p><pre><code>  http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html
</code></pre>
Anyway, it is a mouthful to explain latency percentiles, but in practice it ends up being an extremely useful measurement. Average latency is just not that important in interactive applications (webapps or otherwise): what you should be measuring is outlier latency. Every service you&#x27;ve ever heard of at google has pagers set to track high-percentile latency over the trailing 1m or 5m or 10m (etc) for user-facing endpoints.<p>Coming back to Rails: latency is of course a concern through the entire stack. The reason Rails is so problematic (in my experience) is that people writing gems never seem to realize when they can and should be doing things in parallel, with the possible exception of carefully crafted SQL queries that get parallelized in the database. The Node.js community is a little better in that they don&#x27;t block on all function calls by convention like folks do in Rails, but it&#x27;s really all just a &quot;cultural&quot; thing. I don&#x27;t know off the top of my head how things generally work in Django...<p>One final thing: GC is a nightmare for high-percentile latency, and any dynamic language has to contend with it. Especially if multiple requests are processed concurrently, which is of course necessary to get reasonable throughput.<p>Hope this helps.",1376008628

Do you have such a definition or theory, and are you willing to share it?<p>&quot;most of the definitions you want for don&#x27;t globally exist because we&#x27;ve given up the assumption of global consistency&quot;<p>You might have, but for currency to work there needs to be consistency across the entire market (not necessarily <i>all</i> markets, of course; currency exchanges exist mainly to allow people to move between markets).  One of the most important functions of money is <i>as a medium of exchange</i>, which requires an agreement across the entire market about what constitutes valid money.<p>&quot;More importantly, stop talking about &quot;cryptography&quot;.&quot;<p>Why should I?  Digital cash is a cryptography problem.  Secure multiparty computation is a major field of study in cryptography; Silvio Micali and Shafi Goldwasser, the pair who recently won a Turing award for their work on defining public key cryptography, also happen to have done <i>extensive</i> SMC work over their respective careers.  Cryptographic solutions to the Byzantine Generals problem have been presented many times over the past 20 years.  No matter how you try to describe Bitcoin, it absolutely is a cryptosystem and cryptography absolutely is relevant to the conversation.<p>Furthermore it is dead wrong to think that the security of a signature system or a hash function is the whole story.  Unless you can rigorously prove that the security of ECDSA and SHA256 imply the security of Bitcoin (whatever the rigorous definition of security would be for Bitcoin), there is no point in saying that ECDSA and SHA256 are secure.  Nobody is calling their security into question here.  Bitcoin can be insecure in the cryptographic sense even if ECDSA and SHA256 are secure, unless you think that Bitcoin is a signature system or a hash function.<p>&quot;you keep blowing right past it&quot;<p>What I keep doing is <i>asking for definitions</i>.  You have ignored or avoided the question over and over again here.  To be clear, I am asking you to <i>give a rigorous definition of the security property</i> you want to achieve.  That can and should be given as a corollary to a definition of money, since you are not using the definitions economists are familiar with.  If Bitcoin is nothing more than a solution to the Byzantine agreement problem, then I see no reason to continue talking about money -- unless you can define money in terms of Byzantine agreement.",1376008587

In the lavabit case, my theory is that it went as follows:<p>- The FBI compels lavabit through a FISA warrant/NSA to produce Snowden&#x27;s emails/data/etc.<p>- This data is encrypted, so lavabit cannot comply immediately. However, on logging in, Snowden provides lavabit with his password so that they can decrypt the emails.<p>- Since lavabit then has the password and access to the emails, they are now required to hand that over to the government. They may need to add some code to store the password, but that is not a fundamental change to the system; it is merely a way of intercepting the data they are sent and required to hand over to the government.<p>So [I think that] the government does not order lavabit to make changes, it orders it to produce evidence. Such an order would not make much sense when aimed at the GPG authors.",1376007721

press (posted on August 7, 2013) that lawyers had discussions with a specific media person to
arrange an in-person interview with Brown in jail. GB at 11 (27). Presumably, the specific
media person referenced by the government is Michael Hastings, a journalist, friend and
colleague of Mr. Brown who passed away on June 18, 2013 in Los Angeles California. Counsel
does not dispute that Mr. Hastings, as with many other members of the media, contacted counsel
seeking an in-person interview with Mr. Brown. To counsels knowledge, Mr. Hastings did not
visit or conduct an in-person interview Mr. Brown before his death.&quot;<p>No hints of conspiracy, just the defendant pointing out he is not multiple persons at the same time so they should &#x27;articulate&#x27; something that deals with Barrett directly.",1376006853

The heating element in the atomiser, a coil of resistance wire wrapped around some sort of wick, is consumable. Either the whole atomizer (in the case of a cartomizer) or the atomizer head (in the case of most clearomizers) has to be replaced every few months. Rebuildable atomizers are made so that you can make your own heating coil and wick instead of throwing out the cartomizer or head. There&#x27;s a lot of technique to making good coils, almost like a craft.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to mix you own liquid from ingredients.",1376006832

There are a few things in the language I&#x27;m not huge fan of, I don&#x27;t like overly subtle things in a language. For example, some of the functionality around semi colons seem like they will be a common source of stupid programmer bugs that are difficult to track down. Perhaps the compiler will catch that stuff.<p>Go kinda ruined other languages for me with multiple return values, its something I miss when working in every other language now. And reading through the docs I keep hoping I would stumble across that, though that would create a lot of problems when interfacing with C. Type inference is a huge win, standard libraries looks solid, love the potential around marking variables as mutable, and any language that has no null values makes me happy.<p>Overall, I wish I had more time too.",1376006610

Telegram is not encrypted by default. Users have to create a special &quot;secret chat&quot; with contacts that is ephemeral, and some Telegram clients don&#x27;t even support that mode. Last I checked, there was no way to have group &quot;secret chats&quot; in any client at all.<p>The result is an unfortunate situation where many users seem to think that Telegram is somehow secure by default, when it definitely isn&#x27;t.

9134255,comment,9130144,9130144,0,0,Throwaway90283,,,"Few things to keep in mind...<p>1. It takes a while to see results. This is something you do for life. Don&#x27;t start working out 2 hours a day, get burnt out because you&#x27;re not looking like a Greek God by next month, and give up. Your goal isn&#x27;t to get fit the next few weeks, it&#x27;s to turn your life around and to get into a balanced routine.<p>2. Find exercises you enjoy. I hate treadmills, I get bored after a few minutes and I can never stay motivated to use them. However, I enjoy biking, I can bike for hours in a nearby park, my legs will be burning, and I&#x27;ll be having fun. Indoor exercise bikes I don&#x27;t mind either. The same applies to weights, I use a few dumbbells and they&#x27;re alright, but I really enjoy bodyweight exercises. I&#x27;ve been having a lot of fun with weighted parallel bar dips, and pullups lately. I see results with them, and look forward to it. My advice is to try out lots of difference exercises, and pick the ones that feel right for you, while still covering all the major muscle groups. This is the difference between going to the gym on a regular basis, and making excuses not to go. If you hate your workout routine, you&#x27;re not going to stay motivated.<p>3. Work is always there. Until you die, there will always be code to refactor, bugs to fix, support questions to respond to, features to add, and higher revenue targets. It doesn&#x27;t end, you&#x27;ll never be done. Similar to exercise, it&#x27;s a lifetime process, so you need to find balance. Set aside a day a week, like Sunday, where you don&#x27;t work at all, you just clean your house, organize your desk, wash dishes, go shopping, return e-mails to friends and family, and get everything non-work related finished. Also, do the same daily, and set aside certain hours for yourself. For example, every evening, 5-8, you spent time exercising, then making a decent dinner. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you do, just pick specific hours, and spend it improving yourself.",1425329710

Injecting my own interpretations - the proportion of startups to established businesses in an economy is dependent upon a.) the pace of change and b.) the degree of interconnectedness in the economy [because when firms are tightly connected, there is a high chance that future technological developments will invalidate fundamental assumptions that existing firms&#x27; existence is based upon, while when firms are generally siloed and vertically integrated, they are unlikely to be affected by the entry of new firms into the market].  Both of these variables are increasing rapidly today.  That&#x27;s going to put increasing evolutionary pressure on existing old-line industries, such that we may see a mass-extinction event in the near future where a number of prominent industries all go down en-masse.<p>What Berkshire and YC have in common is a full appreciation for the effect of compound interest and a willingness to employ that capital by putting their fingers in an increasing number of pies.",1425329623

Only &quot;grandfathered in&quot; employees have PERS 1 pension.<p>However, I think the promises made to that generation must be considered.  In many cases, working for the government is less cash salary in exchange for other benefits.  For example, I make $87k working for the state but was offered $110k+bonus at Microsoft.  Why the difference? The state can compensate me in additional non-monetary ways, which make up the difference of the value proposition.  If that ceases to be true, so be it, and I will seek employment else; but don&#x27;t try to go back in time and retroactively revoke something earned.<p>If those promised, contracted benefits are taken away with the swipe of a pen, why should that be a legal or moral thing to do?  I&#x27;m ok with saying &quot;moving forward, we won&#x27;t be offering pensions to anyone new&quot;, but to go back in time and invalidate the contracted benefit from past work?  It&#x27;s like if you contract with someone and say &quot;work for a month and I will pay for $5000.&quot;  Then at the end of the month, you say &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t have the money.  That&#x27;s too bad.&quot;  Of course that would be a violation and the courts would step in.  Should it be any different with the state?",1425329277

Bizarre accounting assumptions that require the full pension cost for every current employee (or in the case of the USPO, employees not yet born) to be held in liquid assets in the present day are unrealistic. Yes, you may represent the presumed liability as a debt, but it&#x27;s a debt that we know will not have to be paid out in full and which is constantly being paid off every cycle.<p>In short, pension liability &quot;concerns&quot; are often an effort to create an artificial budget crisis to use for political purposes, rather than an actual crisis.

The embodied energy of a PC (ie, energy required to make it) is huge.<p>>life cycle energy use of a computer is dominated by production (83%) as opposed to operation (17%). The yearly life cycle cost of owning a computer is about 3,000 MJ/year, half again that of a refrigerator, a much larger appliance that uses far more electricity in operation. The short lifespan of computers and the variety of computing needs of users suggests that extension of lifespan, for example by promptly reselling to users who need less computing power, is a promising approach to mitigating environmental impacts.<p>This is from a study[1] from 2004 of a 1990 PC, inclusive of CRT... I suspect the figures are similar if not worse, as power consumption has come down a lot while chip sizes have remained similar... regardless, the point is so strong that it seems quite likely to remain true whatever the case -- unless your idea of a &#x27;PC&#x27; is a rPI.2, which might be useful for some of the same scenarios, but certainly not all-- it&#x27;s still far from the CPU power of a 2.8ghz p4.

(It was, in fact, a Tumblr post that was Patient Zero in “The Dress” contagion that ate the Internet last week.)<p>I think the above excerpt, is a good reflection of what I believe the OP means by defending MM.<p>It may be unfair to try to sum up MM&#x27;s time as CEO in terms of acquisitions, but its simply what the media has highlighted and I am sure Yahoo wants the media banging that drum for all its worth.  Therefore, if the biggest argument for the $1.1B Tumblr acquisition is pointing to the latest viral post, I consider that running to her defense.  From the tone of this article, the stockholders are demanding cost savings (sounds like less employees), new revenue streams and a general direction for the company.  For better or worse the CEO is responsible for making the stockholders happy, I personally think Yahoo&#x27;s niche could be in privacy - give users alternatives to Google, Facebook, Gmail, cloud storage with a focus on what people want...privacy.  IMHO Yahoo has always had a respectable focus on the cross section of technology, privacy and human rights  (maybe one of the first in tech to create a human rights program).",1425328096

A lot of Unix programmers tended to behave as if &quot;long&quot; was the largest native type (&quot;long long&quot; on 32-bit uses a pair of registers). They have to scrub their whole code base for things like assuming an object&#x27;s size or array index will always fit on a &quot;long&quot;.<p>----<p>For Firefox, there&#x27;s the additional problem of plugins. For a long time, plugins on Windows have been 32-bit, and also for a long time, plugins for Firefox on Windows (and other operating systems) were in-process, so it wasn&#x27;t possible to use a 32-bit plugin with a 64-bit browser.<p>Nowadays, not only can Firefox use a separate process for plugins, but also the whole idea of browser plugins seems to be dying, so it&#x27;s less of a problem.",1425327788

When I was working at low-level jobs right out of college it wasn&#x27;t always permitted or feasible to install applications like that on shared computers anyway.  In-browser chat was a godsend and I liked how I could add my AIM account back when that seemed to be one of the more popular IM options among my non-techie friends.<p>Honestly I think Gmail/GTalk owe a lot to AOL for allowing that interoperability.  Sites like Facebook would never allow you to connect with Google+ and use a competitor&#x27;s site to access their platform.  It takes away their biggest advantages (critical mass and inertia).<p>But it&#x27;s right after lunch and I&#x27;m getting off topic.  Personally I still use Hangouts as my primary IM/chat platform because it doesn&#x27;t seem to give my systems much of a performance hit and it lets me carry conversations between machines and my phone without having to install apps all over.  I use Pidgin at work but for everything else, Hangouts is still my default.  Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;d mind performance improvements though.",1425327520

But I&#x27;m wrong when I suggest it is theoretical issue, when it&#x27;s actually practical issue?<p>I&#x27;ve read that &quot;the theory behind Coq is generally admitted to be consistent with regard to Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory + inaccessible cardinals&quot;. [1] I also read that some statements are undecidable in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory [2]. It follows from this that it must exist some statements that are undecidable in Coq, correct? But I understand that this is theoretical issue, not a practical one, because &quot;Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, combined with first-order logic, gives a satisfactory and generally accepted formalism for essentially all current mathematics&quot;. Is it the reason why my comment was wrong?<p>On this topic, I&#x27;ve read an article titled &quot;Computer verification of Wiles&#x27; proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem&quot; which explains that Wile&#x27;s proof could probably be verified with a tool like Coq, but that would be a massive challenge:<p>> The mathematics used in Wiles&#x27; proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is very complicated. [...] I do not know the provers Coq and Mizar good enough, but I think they are adequate to express the mathematics.<p>> On the other hand, I do think that the challenge is doable, and that it will be done in the coming fifty years. It is definitely not within reach. The project will have to cover large parts of current pure mathematics. Its scope is comparable with the Bourbaki project, where between 1950 and 1970 almost all of pure mathematics got a new foundation by the efforts of an originally French group of mathematicians who published some 20 books under the pseudonym N. Bourbaki.<p>[1] <a href=""https://coq.inria.fr/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coq.inria.fr/faq</a>

A large part of Wikipedia’s problems stem directly the “article” format of most wiki pages (and Fereated Wiki maintains the same page metaphor). This gives presentation problems in that it forces the web page to look like a book page, but more importantly, allows any editor to veto any content on the page. This gives rise to real or imagined experts believing they “own” the page, and from that groupthink, harassment, bias naturally follow.

However, I believe that fact checking current news stories is over-rated. Why do we need to fact-check the old story, when a more accurate news story will come along anyway? Again this stems from the wiki, formatting the page as an article, rather than, say, a stream of information.<p>There are other solutions that can mitigate problems that arise from using wikis, such as assigning anonymous editors to check content, and paying editors to contribute.

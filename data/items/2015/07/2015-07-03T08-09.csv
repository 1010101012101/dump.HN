If this was the final straw of &quot;mishandled AMA&#x27;s&quot; (seriously? what does AMA stand for again? don&#x27;t go there if your kind of celebrity status / personality can&#x27;t handle this elegantly), I think it had to do with the sensitive nature of religion.

9824382,comment,9822975,9823965,0,0,mc808,,,"AFAIK, return statements are literally the only place where brace style is affected by ASI.<p><pre><code>    var result =
    {
        key: &quot;value&quot;
    };

    return result;
</code></pre>
works fine, plus it lets you more easily break on the return statement and verify/modify what will be returned when debugging. It would be kind of awkward to see braces like that in JavaScript, but a style guide could just ban returning object literals and make the ASI issue moot (at least regarding braces; you still have the other gotchas with forgetting a comma in a variable declaration, etc).",1435913794

The reddit community has always been a very proudly geeky bunch that enthusiastically embraced internet culture.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to describe internet culture to someone for whom it isn&#x27;t endogenous - at its best, it combines a commitment to free expression, a geeky pride in understanding how things work, a strong appreciation for authenticity, a pushback against attention seeking, and an embrace of a multitude of interests.<p>At its worse, well, it&#x27;s really bad - you get the opinions of minorities dismissed, and you can have people doing all sorts of heinous stuff (revenge porn, etc) under the guise of free speech.<p>However, to horribly paraphrase Whitman.. it contains multitudes.  Watching what used to be a beloved site being run by people who don&#x27;t seem to even understand the ideals of their users is very grating.<p>As an analogy, imagine if the editor of the NYRB somehow ended up as the director of the organization that runs Nascar.

A lot of gripe from long time users of AngularJS comes from Angular&#x27;s problems in real-world production scenarios (e.g. large amount of data means two-way binding kills performance but two-way binding is what makes the prototypes so compelling; third party directives make it easy to do all kinds of things but writing your own directives can be difficult and disillusioning; etc).<p>Basically, the important question to ask when being dazzled by impressively easy deployment demos is: is this representative of what my experience will be like developing a real-world medium to large scale production app?<p>So far my impression of Meteor has been that it&#x27;s only achieving that &quot;simplicity&quot; by completely ignoring problems like initial page load.

If you know then inside-out, you know what to pick to solve a problem. Get a good book on Algorithms & Data Structures or follow a course or two.<p>My second advise would be to pick the area that interests you the most. Read the foundational books, follow the leaders in the field, and do projects (they are good practice and help you to build a portfolio). Put a strong filter on the stuff that irrelevant to your chosen area (only read the most interesting bits). You will find that you quickly change from novice to expert in your area.<p>When it comes to programming languages: it&#x27;s fun and useful to know some languages. But in the end what you ship is more important. So, just pick a language that feels natural for solving the problem and don&#x27;t get too distracted by armchair PL philosophers ;).",1435913412

I am typically starting from scratch.<p>Reason: I thought I wasn&#x27;t a good developer. More I read HN, articles, stories, more I got anxious and left my job to pursue research degree. I figured out I lacked mathematical abilities to do research in the field I wanted to. I became depressed and I felt regret all the time.<p>After 7 months, I realized I was chasing the horizon. I have realized it&#x27;s not the new things you learn or the awesome technologies you learn that matters. Things that matter are: Being good at what you do, whatever it be...some people spent life juggling balls. They aren&#x27;t genius in maths, science etc. but they are awesome at what they do. It makes you feel wow !<p>Second, it&#x27;s about being happy. If you are writing this post in HN then you belong to very privileged class of people in the world. Be thankful for what you have.

All that matters is the happy moments you have shared with your loved ones.<p>Third. Don&#x27;t take what&#x27;s written by founders or geniuses seriously. Read, acknowledge and move on.

9824329,comment,9823985,9823985,0,0,Jugurtha,,,"I can relate, except that I still stuck.<p>1 - What has helped me is to categorize my insterests. Sure, they&#x27;re connected in my brain and it&#x27;s not like x is disconnected with y, we can always find a connection.. but I needed to separate them into categories to be able to manage them more easily because I don&#x27;t need to tell you the state of the brain if you dump all of them in the one and only category most of us have which is labelled &quot;Interesting&quot; since we find every darn thing interesting.<p>Here&#x27;s what I did:<p>I separated things into &quot;Pillars&quot;. The way I think about them are Ministeries (I needed a really bureaucratic rigid structure to balance out the clustermess the brain is): Engineering, Business, Lifestyle, and Self Improvement.<p>Doing this alone has allowed to be conscious that I&#x27;m neglecting this category or that one, because now they have a name and I can measure stuff. Before, everything was just &quot;Interesting&quot; and it&#x27;s not really easy to track down since they all blended together in a homogenous whole. It&#x27;s like being in a bath and you&#x27;re not really aware of <i>when</i> the water became cold. Tagging avoids that problem.<p>Compute how many hours you can dedicate for the whole stuff per <i>week</i>. There was a time I studied for 16 hours a day but it&#x27;s not really the best course. It depends on your situation (work, etc). Most people say they don&#x27;t have time but they <i>really</i> have a <i>lot</i> of time. A lot would spend hours on Facebook, then hours watching TV, and then complain and describe themselves as if they&#x27;re not the &quot;sitting facing a computer person&quot;. Most are on a 5 hours minimum wasted per day diet.<p>Each of those &quot;Ministeries&quot; gets a chunk of that time as a <i>weekly</i> budget. And this budget gets divided between the &quot;Departments&quot; making up that Ministery (say Engineering has Control Theory, Programming, Signal Processing, etc. Each one gets its weekly ration)<p>So imagine 40 hour per week for the whole 4 Ministeries. Say Engineering gets 20. From those 20, Control gets 5 hours per week, etc..<p>Thinking in <i>weeks</i> was important because there&#x27;s only so much stuff you can fit in a day, and if you think in days, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see the whole picture, which is: Making sure you touch each of your areas of interests on a regular basis.<p>I&#x27;m sure you spent so much time on something really interesting, only to find that you completely forgot another thing that&#x27;s really interesting on which you&#x27;ve spent a tremendous amount of time and of which you now recall nothing. Right? Sounds familiar? The feeling of the wasted time and still barely remembering a thing can make you punch walls.<p>So, instead of doing the same stuff for whole weeks or months.. You do many things that you visit several times a week. This sort of refreshes your cache with a high enough rate that you don&#x27;t neglect a topic, but low enough for other things to be touched, too. In other words, you don&#x27;t touch TOPIC 1 <i>every single day</i>, but even if you touch it every other day, the switching is fast enough you have the impression you&#x27;re doing it every day.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work if you have very few areas of interest, but works wonders if you have many. This is also why a week goes by &quot;really fast&quot;, and why some people feel it&#x27;s long (because they&#x27;re not doing much. Some people actually do get bored).<p>Finally, limit things.<p>Not the amount of things you&#x27;re interested in (although that helps.. But limit resources. I was interested in Python and was wondering which book was good, and where to start.. 4 years would pass. If I had read 10 pages per day of <i>any</i> book <i>while</i> I was trying to decide, I would&#x27;ve been much better at it right now.<p>This is where you have to be narrow-minded.. Want to learn Calculus? That one is tricky since most books suck and aren&#x27;t my style, but pick one book and go through it. Even at 10 pages a day, 3650 pages per year. That&#x27;s 6 books in a year on Calculus.. I&#x27;d bet <i>anything</i> that you&#x27;d be at the very least better than if you were still <i>deciding</i> which one to read.<p>Hope this helps (I struggled a lot and still have to pay attention to that).",1435912703

The reason this aphorism makes sense is that global warming due to increased greenhouse gases should warm the earth in a progressive, slow way---not in huge jumps.   Here in the Northwest, temperature increases have been particularly slow (about 1F over the past century) because of the huge thermal inertia of the Pacific Ocean.<p>> And there is something else: the warming influencing our region is localized and does not have the characteristics of the global warming signal seen in climate models.   While the Northwest has been hot and dry, much of the eastern U.S. has been much cooler and wetter than normal.   Even the Rockies have been wetter than normal.   Global warming would warm them as well.  This week I was at a weather conference in Chicago....it was quite chilly there at times.<p>I think this section, particularly the second paragraph, shows the writer has a very poor understanding of what global warming is and how it can and will have different localized effects across different timeframes.",1435912054

It takes a certain skill to understand those things!<p>As someone who&#x27;s been at it for years, I&#x27;ll just give you one little piece of advice. If you&#x27;ve already been through the fundamentals, you&#x27;ve done enough. Now, instead of focusing on learning technology, focus on building things, this is what real engineers do.<p>Let me explain. You&#x27;ll probably get much better with at least one thing once you ship a real project to the end, and this is where you&#x27;ll get better.<p>One of the best programmers I&#x27;ve ever worked with was a PHP guy when I met him, and he was good because he shipped efficient, tested, and working code fast, all while being able to document and communicate about it with his team. That&#x27;s what being a programmer is. You won&#x27;t become a good professional programmer by chasing after hip technologies (even though learning different paradigms always help), but by building things, and preferably with people, because this is how things work in the real world.<p>As long as you stay with startups and technology companies, you&#x27;ll see that any CTO or lead dev worth his salt would rather hire a smart Perl programmer with strong fundamentals who shipped things over someone (maybe smart too) who knows a bit of JS, a bit of Java, and a bit of Haskell. This is, however, <i>not</i> true with a lot of non-tech companies, where keywords on resume, a professional-looking attitude, and some good sales skills will usually get you better positions.<p>It&#x27;s never too late, don&#x27;t fear irrelevance, build things, and have fun!",1435912038

9824263,comment,9823886,9823886,0,0,chipsy,,,"Think of the architecture as a wheel that you&#x27;re running in like a hamster. You never &quot;finish&quot; architecting, but you know that you make progress when you complete full revolutions of the wheel. In the first half of the wheel, you code simply and naively and accumulate features and problems. In the second half, you gradually sort out those problems, identifying the low-hanging fruit for refactors first and then gradually applying more advanced techniques to go from an 80% correct solution to 90% by identifying the things that are key components, which would benefit from a more complex treatment, while throwing out things that are unjustifiably complex and replacing them with &quot;dumber&quot; code. Then in the next revolution, you go from 90% to 95%, and then to 98%, 99%, 99.9%, and so on, until the day the codebase is abandoned.<p>If you apply the procedures in the wrong order - trying to do advanced design in the first half of the wheel, for example - the project immediately suffers because of premature assumptions. This is why rewrites are so risky, because you&#x27;re throwing out accumulated knowledge from previous turns of the wheel in the hopes that you can jump to a higher correctness level. Remember - even if you succeed at the rewrite, you never get to 100%.<p>So, based on your description, we can say that you&#x27;re somewhere in the second half, and you currently have a problem with analysis of the current architecture. First figure out which parts are highest priority, and which are likely to continue to last for a whole turning unaided. Then dig into the structure of the high-priority code looking for two things:<p>1. Bad factorings - things that would work better if they were rewritten inlined. Each time you inline, you remove at least one point of dependency; each time you factor out something done in two places, you add at least one point of reuse. Thus you can make a ton of progress just by inlining the existing source, reading the result, and then finding new reusable parts in that - typically the outcome is a net positive on dependencies/reuse.<p>2. Bad data design - structures that cause more problems than they solve. At first data is always &quot;just&quot; parameters passed to an algorithm, but in any real program data soon also has to carry around information determining the future state of the program at a broader level(running different code based on the type of the data, etc.). It&#x27;s this second aspect that is key - what you are looking for is how the current form of the data is motivating dependencies in the code, and whether a different canonical form would reduce dependencies. Sometimes this means more structure, sometimes it means less.<p>This is a &quot;shaking off the dust&quot; action where you discover the true nature of the codebase - as opposed to everyone&#x27;s initial conceptions - and it can be done at any time. You can also use techniques like drawing the callgraph or running benchmarking tools with an eye towards finding architectural bottlenecks. Eventually you&#x27;ll see patterns that warrant the inclusion of some nice higher-level, shared construct. Those are the design wins you are looking for - you only need one or two of them to make a huge impact, and they only come right at the completion of the revolution, enabling a new round of more naive, product-facing code to be written. Taking care of the low-hanging fruit makes the code base less confusing to work on, thus it typically precedes the big wins.<p>The introduction of new external dependencies like a different database product is one of those ways in which you can make a big win, but you don&#x27;t want to add a big dependency lightly, since it raises the lower bound on how much effort is needed just to maintain the system at a basic level. It&#x27;s always another tradeoff that adds new code &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, and the main advantage is that you aren&#x27;t writing that new code yourself.<p>As you go through this process, testing and static analysis becomes crucial for making sure all the shuffling around of things isn&#x27;t causing an issue, so don&#x27;t proceed until you have a process for that. Testing can always start as a manually-driven checklist, and then automated as automation wins are identified. Likewise, static analysis can start as a human code review process and then be supplemented with automated tools. Too much automation creates another dependency, thus it has to be weighed against human time costs.",1435911600

The better your software architecture is, the more resistant to technology changes it will be.
(it doesn&#x27;t only apply to technology changes, by the way).<p>I understand your examples. When a technology changes occurs, all code directly depending on this technology doesn&#x27;t &quot;survive&quot;. If you make SQL requests from your view code, the view code will probably need to be mostly rewritten when you decide to change the database. But a good architecture will not feature SQL requests from the view code. A good architecture will prevent components to depend on things they don&#x27;t need. A good architecture will introduce layers to guarantee some degree of independence. So when a technology change occurs, most of the code &quot;survives&quot;.<p>It all boils down to managing dependencies: you don&#x27;t want high-level code (business rules, use cases) to depend on low-level code (storage, display).
High-level code is the reason why your application exists. It&#x27;s independent from low-level details such as &quot;my storage system is a SQL database&quot; or &quot;my webserver is Apache&quot;, or even &quot;the code runs on MS Windows&quot;.<p>Porting is exactly this: changing some low-level concretion (OS, middleware) while keeping the same logical behaviour (i.e from the user point of view).",1435911479

And it’s surprising how much can be fixed by a small group of resourceful people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, and the willingness to work closely with dedicated civil servants in government.<p>Our revamped Healthcare.gov application has been used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time. The login system we rebuilt is about two orders of magnitude more reliable and two orders of magnitude less expensive; for example, it’s about $70M less per year to operate. We’re just getting started, and we’ve started Nava to help fix everything else. [0]<p>People die because the Veteran&#x27;s Administration is months behind in processing claims. The Social Security Administration pays benefits to millions of deceased Americans. $80 billion is spent every year on federal IT contracting, and 96% of projects are deemed failures [1].<p>That’s not because there’s some conspiracy or because government is inherently incapable of doing it right. These are complicated legacy systems and processes, and there are very few people with modern tech industry experience who are aware of these problems and willing to help fix them. You can help change that.<p>Our team is 10 people (Stanford, Google, YC alums), and we plan to bring on a few people every month through 2015.<p>We’re looking for: 
- experienced full-stack engineers 
- experienced devops engineers 
- a product manager with a technical background 
- a hyper-resourceful operations person<p>We have a social mission (we just incorporated as a public benefit corporation (PBC) this week), but we pay market compensation (above market, for DC) and equity (above market).<p>If you&#x27;d like to build software and infrastructure that radically improves how our government serves people, we’d love to hear from you at jobs@navahq.com.<p>*Not in DC / able to relocate, but intrigued and in SF?

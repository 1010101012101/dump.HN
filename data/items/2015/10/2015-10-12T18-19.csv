It&#x27;s hard to beat ES/Solr/Lucene for text searches, but depending on what you need, Postgres&#x27; full text search may be fine.  Most use-cases where search is the need use some other datastore and just ES for the text searches.

What makes them seem more alike than the varieties of stack based system is that the first pass at a notation for ordering application (parenthesis) is recommended by its similarity to the mathematical notation for ordering application. In other words, languages modelled [more or less] on lambda-calculus look like &quot;a thing&quot; by the accident of similar notation, whereas languages modelled [more or less] on Turing machines don&#x27;t look like &quot;a thing&quot; by virtue of the diversity of notation.<p>In practice, this means that Scheme and Common Lisp and Clojure get lumped together while Forth and Cobol and C# don&#x27;t, even though there is as much variation between the execution model in the first group as the second.",1444676265

Each bus can carry 10 to 12 passengers along the road at speeds of up to 20 kilometers an hour, around the same speed as a milk float, but faster than a golf buggy.<p>“I was saying…a bus without a driver, how could it be?,” asked one elderly woman who took a trip out one of the tiny buses. “But I really enjoyed it and had no problem. It’s like a regular bus. I will use it, since it passes through my neighborhood.”<p>The buses are electric, silent and non-polluting.<p>...<p>---",1444675951

The difference is a 100-200 pages of work. Plus, the LISP can self-modify during compile to add any subsequent feature.<p>It&#x27;s not machismo: it&#x27;s just the design of LISP. Easy to parse, easy to modify, easy to evaluate, data as code, basic primitives that express anything else at least acceptably, and on 50&#x27;s-60&#x27;s hardware.<p>Additionally, building a useful LISP (esp Scheme) is an academic exercise done all over the world that&#x27;s fairly easy even for amateurs. Building a useful, non-optimizing C++ compiler with only a subset of LISP capabilities is an exercise only undertaken by masochists very dedicated to compiler design. Even a prototype is easier for LISP (a few pages of code) while a prototype of C++ or even C&#x27;s semantics is much more challenging.

10376297,comment,10372739,10375369,0,0,graycat,,,"Yup.<p>> had to spend a lot of money on getting things<p>When I was at IBM&#x27;s Watson lab, the PC 
on my desk had parts worth a total of
$50,000+.<p>When I bought my first PC at home, from
Gateway, it cost me $10,000+.  Single core,
90 MHz clock.<p>Later a friend and I considered a startup,
I went shopping, and saw that parts
for a good PC would run ballpark $6,000 --
we didn&#x27;t do the startup!<p>Later I wanted a more up to date PC,
and the parts cost about $5000.
So, single core 1.8 GHz processor,
that is 1800 / 90 = 20 times
faster for half as much money.<p>Now I&#x27;m shopping for the first server
for my startup.  I&#x27;ve been assuming that
the parts would cost about $2000.
Nope:  How about $1000, for 
a processor with 8 cores,
at 4.0 GHz, with 32 GB of ECC
main memory, etc.<p>But I already have a spare 
screen and power supply,
now really want to do backup
from one hard disk to another,
both internal, and to a 
2 TB external hard disk via
USB so don&#x27;t need Blu-Ray.<p>And good 1 TB hard disks go for
about $60 and, thus, make
room enough for internal
disk to disk backup 
surprisingly cheap and
easier than working with
Blu-Ray disks.<p>And main memory prices are 
significantly lower:  E.g.,
the Kingston, 32 GB of
1600 MHz ECC main memory<p>KVR16E11K4/32<p>was $429 but now 
is easy enough to find
for $230.99, nearly half price.<p>So, $700 gets such an 8 core
box.<p>But, for my first server, really
not sure I need the full 8 cores,
32 GB of main memory right away
so could
settle for 4 cores with a slightly
slower clock and 16 GB of main
memory and three disk drives
1 TB each, for under $400.<p>So, start with a $400 server
and, if it stays busy sending
Web pages with ads, then 
the ad revenue just from
on the way to getting busy
should be much more than
needed for some high end
servers.<p>And now 1 GbE IP routers are
much cheaper, too!<p>And for $90 a month
my ISP can give me
a connection with a static
IP address, no ports blocked,
and upload bandwidth
of 35 Mbps.  Half fill
that 24 x 7 sending Web pages
with ads, and should be
able to show a profit!<p>Several US locations
have 1 GbE service!<p>Prices, they&#x27;ve been a coming down!<p>It used to be, to bring up a 
busy Web
site, needed big bucks to, say, Sun
and maybe a T3 leased line, etc.<p>Now nearly everything about bringing
up a Web site is much easier and cheaper
than 10-15 years ago.<p>E.g., my startup is based on
Windows, so I get to use IIS and
ASP.NET for the Web site,
ADO.NET and SQL Server 
for the data base,
parts of the rest of .NET
for more, e.g., de/serialization
of instances of classes
for program to program communications
over TCP/IP sockets.  Some big
sites use this infrastructure;
it should work well enough for
my startup!<p>E.g., I
wrote my own Web site session
state server key-value store using
TCP/IP sockets, de/serialization,
and two instances of a .NET
collection class.  The .NET collection
class was great fun to use!
Terrific infrastructure.<p>Much easier, cheaper than 10-15 years ago!",1444675539

In case it isn&#x27;t obvious, <i>making money</i> and <i>successful</i> are the same thing.  A company can make money serving niche markets, and many do.<p>> the fundamentals of each business<p>Microsoft&#x27;s top product by both revenue and profit is Windows.  Windows has a leading market share on only a single class of device (desktops and laptops), and that market itself has been consistently shrinking in each of the last several years (2013: <a href=""http://b-i.forbesimg.com/anthonykosner/files/2013/04/ChartOfTheDay_1037_Global_PC_Market_in_Q1_2013_n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://b-i.forbesimg.com/anthonykosner/files/2013/04/ChartOf...</a> 2014: <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/08/pc-market-share-q3-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/08/pc-market-share-q3-2014/</a> 2015: <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3090817"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3090817</a>).  Forecasts are for continued shrinkage of that market.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair or prudent to ignore those fundamentals, as they clearly are central to Microsoft&#x27;s ability to make money.  Azure may be doing well and may even grow into a strong #2 in its space, but it&#x27;s still less than 10% the size of the market leader and it generated well under a billion dollars of <i>revenue</i> last year (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/04/15/sizing-microsoft-azure-and-amazon-aws-revenue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/04/15/sizing-...</a>), accounting for less than 1% (<a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AMSFT&fstype=ii&ei=RfsbVsGfNMLCiQLJt4LIBQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AMSFT&fstype=ii&ei=R...</a>) of the company&#x27;s total turnover.  It&#x27;s difficult to know if it was profitable, but it hardly matters; the operation is barely even material to the company as a whole.  Azure would need to double in size 4 more times to account for 10% of Microsoft&#x27;s revenue.<p>Again: I didn&#x27;t say Microsoft is going to go out of business tomorrow.  Or next year or even in 2025.  But you should acknowledge that a backward-looking view of the company is risky, and that an objective forward-looking assessment of its business is less rosy than you would make it out to be.  At best, the company will be much less dominant than it was in the 90s.<p>> I mean to suggest that these companies are in trouble because of OSS such as MongoDB<p>I didn&#x27;t.

I agree that the impact of MongoDB on the named companies&#x27; bottom lines has been negligible, and that no evidence of such impact has been offered.<p>The author and many of the comments here have strayed well into hyperbole, probably fueled in part by ignorance and in part by schadenfreude and glee at seeing some poorly-managed companies in mature markets struggling to remain successful (HP is, after all, the poster child for mismanagement in this space).  I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve made the same error.  If you think I have, please provide supporting evidence, as I have provided for my position.",1444675187

But few websites are able to incorporate these methods across as wide a range of articles as they are with banner ads.&quot;<p>What was claimed is the versatility of the standard ad to a wide variety of content sites. Almost 90% of the top-100 websites run ads. So that&#x27;s not much of a stretch.<p>Native ads are something we should all be very scared of.

The same sort of flow-state you get from e.g. playing Minecraft, also exists in the real-world equivalent of survivalist bootstrapping. Our brains were evolved to be <i>stimulated by</i> the survival tasks of our ancestral environments: moreso foraging and hunting than farming, but even farming still comes with very natural-to-us acts like crafting tools, clearing land, building shelter, herding animals, etc.<p>I think a lot of the dissonance between the modern values of convenience and efficiency/laziness, and the agricultural-era idea of a &quot;work ethic&quot;, was simply that certain kinds of things that are &quot;a LOT of work&quot; just feel natural to humans, in ways where they&#x27;re still work (and drudgery, at that, sometimes), but not nearly as <i>draining</i> to one&#x27;s long-term motivation as modern &quot;abstract&quot; work is. Nobody ever got suffered from &quot;burn-out&quot; making nails to build their own house—which is amazing when you think about the level of toil involved. The sheer direct intuitiveness of the goal being pursued—make exactly enough nails to get a roof over one&#x27;s head and keep out the cold—overrides a lot of the the feeling of repetitiveness of the base-level action.<p>(A dystopia belonging in an SMBC comic: a nail factory that used to be staffed with robots, but which is now staffed with humans wearing VR goggles having the times of their lives making nails because they believe they&#x27;re doing it for direct survival reasons.

It just so happens that they have a presence in multiple countries around the world. Due to this Facebook Uk® must pay massive amounts to lease the licenses for software & intellectual property from Facebooks conveniently placed HQ in the lowest tax capitals in the world. Doing so at a price Facebook themselves chooses perhaps based on quarterly earning estimates runs at an amazing cost almost siphoning off all profit.
So the resulting entity which owns all the IP / leasing then pays tax in the country it is in on its earnings. Now they may be incorperated in a place with minimal corporation tax & simply keep a post office box there, but I assure you that&#x27;s entirely the focus of their operations & is absolutely not just in place as a tax avoidance tactic.
Now if you dislike this you can absolutely tell them it&#x27;s unacceptable. I&#x27;m sure politicians will be telling them off and using them to get press for .. oh 7-14 days until people move on & forget about it. At which point those same politicians won&#x27;t change anything which impacts the practices at all.&quot;",1444674530

Instead of drilling into a timeline of bytes sent from Alice to Bob, new concepts can be taught as &quot;progressive layers&quot; of detail (with the timeline rewound each time.)

I know you mean well, but I find that the idea that corporations do this kind of thing doesn&#x27;t need any more proof than the fact that the earth is round.<p>If one follows the news, there are constant reminders of this kind of lobbying going on (corporations asking for special treatment, especially when it comes to taxes) for a whole century. Besides a lot of this is done right out in the open. I mean coorporate lobbying was invented exactly for that -- to push governments for favorable laws, special treatment, laxer environmental and other protections, etc. On top of that, there are all kinds of under-the-table deals (with lots of them exposed frequently) with politicians and corporations.<p>That said, here are some pointers to the issue. First the general Wikipedia article:<p>A number of published studies showed lobbying expenditures can yield great financial returns. For example, a study of the 50 firms that spent the most on lobbying relative to their assets compared their financial performance against that of the S&P 500 in the stock market concluded that spending on lobbying was a &quot;spectacular investment&quot; yielding &quot;blistering&quot; returns comparable to a high-flying hedge fund, even despite the financial downturn of the past few years. A 2011 meta-analysis of previous research findings found a positive correlation between corporate political activity and firm performance. Finally, a 2009 study found that lobbying brought a substantial return on investment, as much as 22,000% in some cases.

An ambitious schedule has been set to complete the full sequence by the end of 2003, two years ahead of previous projections. In the course of completing the sequence, a &quot;working draft&quot; of the human sequence will be produced by the end of 2001.",1444673119

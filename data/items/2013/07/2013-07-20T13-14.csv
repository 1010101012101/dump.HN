Most of the tools I use (vim, nginx, go, etc...) are amazingly high quality but others are seemingly poor - i.e GIMP vs Photoshop, Pages/Word vs LibreOffice Writer. They look pretty awful, they have unintuitive UIs and generally I have a bad time using them. As such, my attitude towards open-source software is it&#x27;s &quot;shit&quot; because it looks terrible. The code may be solid but the UX hasn&#x27;t been refined. This is the main reason why I run OS X; I get to use vim and Photoshop.<p>In some small way, I feel like I&#x27;m forced to use software I genuinely do not enjoy using. I like using Windows and I like using OS X. So far, every Linux distro has forced me back to either OS within a few weeks. Even Elementary OS; practically a clone of OS X ships with sub-par software.<p>Almost all software I run is closed-source/proprietary.

They showed that in the video. So there must be some sort of udp/tcp hole punching to get through the NAT?<p>And then the files sync at the speed of my 832kbps upload speed? So much for &quot;one memory on all devices&quot; when you barely reach 100KB/s reading speeds from your &quot;memory&quot;, divided by the number of users/devices, except for any cached files. But the whole point was: no more moving, copying, downloading or uploading, so caching files (which they showed) is in direct violation with that vision and should not needed to be used.<p>Seems this product is just not for me and it&#x27;s going to disappoint a lot of users (500k backed shows they put a lot of trust in it).

Hiding the content is one thing, but what these government programs mostly consist of is to recreate people&#x27;s networks. This is the main point.

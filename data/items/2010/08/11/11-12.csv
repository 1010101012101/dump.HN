I am no sure it was worth it.<p>I was dealing with a pretty high maintenance client though, and dealt with scope creep and other consulting mainstays. If managed correctly this can be a good way to go, just be careful.",1281527987

Gave me peace of mind to have some stable income (and met some cool people), though the situation was not too dramatic - lowest point was 100E in bank and some bills to pay.\nWe successfully launched the new startup with less features than desired and I've been slowly adding features since. Now slowly transitioning to a combination of being employed by the startup and consulting.",1281527941

So I’ve started doing it myself and I’ll be publishing new articles five days per week.<p>Check it out: http://foundernotes.com/<p>Consider this a version one, a minimum viable product.

Wish I'd thought of it first.'<p>With enough work, it would be as easy to set up (or easier) than any other blog.  The connections to other diaspora instances would be as easy as logging into OpenID...  Just visit their page, put in your URL, request a link, and wait for the other person to grant it.  It could also be done the other way with putting their link into your blog, and having the backend take care of it.  I'm sure there are other ways, too.<p>So yeah, it could work.

1594372,comment,1594054,1594327,0,0,derefr,,,"There's definitely something missing from the description of the experiment. It sounds like the first half of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game</a>. The second half—informing the player that their hypothetical ""anonymous partner"" would get to decide whether both, or neither, of them got the money—provides the incentive for the player to cooperate. Selfishness could then be gauged by how often players still choose ""unfair"" splits despite the chance of rejection.<p>If this is what the experiment was, though, I would question their methodology a bit; an important part of the Ultimatum game is that both partners have to <i>think</i> of one another as human—and therefore capable of irrationality. The partner anonymity in their experimental set-up creates (mental) distance between the partners, which encourages a more rational cost-benefit analysis, vs. the immediate ""I should punish you for giving me such a bad deal"" reaction you have to a real person. If the players realize this, they will benefit by acting more selfishly, because they can rely on their partner to not see them as ""human enough"" to be worth punishing.",1281524822

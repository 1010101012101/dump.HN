Because it doesn't have deep API integration (or even write support), there's not much that I get that I don't get with a dedicated HN RSS reader.<p>Take a look at Envelope for Reddit for an example of how you might do a deeper integration. Beyond adding posting support, you could also build on the fact that it's a client-app, and add additional local-only feature, such as killfiles or filters, etc.<p>Low-hanging fruit would be to display comments inline, rather than just linking off to the website, and letting you read/reply/post to individual threads.<p>GL, I hope you keep going with it.",1360076328

To do that, we have to actually know the right solution; we have to have enough understanding of the problem domain to be able to make accurate predictions of the effects of our actions. We don't have that knowledge in the case of climate change; indeed, we don't have it in most areas in which we currently force collective action on people.<p>Take the recent mortgage bubble as an example. This was the result of a centralized ""solution"" to the ""problem"" of not enough people owning their homes. The result was to create a new way for people to game the system that ended up tanking the entire economy, and now all those additional people who were supposed to own their homes are being foreclosed on and evicted.<p>In short, you appear to have a lot more faith in centralized solutions than I do. I would have thought that the twentieth century, if it showed anything, would have showed that centralized control doesn't work--after all, the Soviet Union was a 70-plus year experiment demonstrating that.",1360076206

The registrar (godaddy) then has to issue an explicit ""delete"" command in order to get the money that they automatically pay (and have to have in an account at the registries) to credit their account.  And they have 45 days to do so. After that they are out the money that it costs them for the domain.<p>Consequently the following is true:<p>1) When a domain expires there is no cost to godaddy to get the domain back.<p>2) When a domain is deleted (and goes into ""redemption"") there is a cost to godaddy to get the domain back.<p>3) Godaddy doesn't need to delete the domain (and save the reg fee ) until 45 days past ""expiration"". As a matter of course most registrars (including us) don't wait until the last minute (system glitch might cause not deleting domains that customer didn't pay for).<p>4) If ""auto renewal"" is ""turned off"" I don't see what that has to do with the time/date the domain is deleted at all. That's just a method of payment.",1360076189

Also, the best list of jobs that I know of in this niche is a Google Spreadsheet.<p>Normally, my answer for them would be to plumb their network, post on StackExchange and LinkedIn, etc., etc., but they have fairly specific needs around experience and prior knowledge. Also, they need to keep some details of their enterprise confidential before they launch, since they're fine on funding and would not benefit from pre-launch publicity.<p>Is using a recruiter unavoidable in this case?

5170837,comment,5170291,5170291,4,0,bjinwright,,,"I'm going to make a couple of assumptions and if I'm wrong just ignore the answer. I'm assuming you are using either PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, or .Net. I'm assuming these are either web servers, worker servers, caching servers, or database servers.<p>With those assumptions made I'm going to suggest some services to use. I don't work for ANY of these companies. I run a small startup that uses most of these companies.<p>For web servers I would recommend using AWS' Elastic Beanstalk. You don't pay anything extra to use this service in addition to the EC2 servers you are using now. If you use reserved instances it is also cheaper than pretty much any other PaaS out there (Google App Engine gives it a good run for the money). Recently I did a spreadsheet outlining the savings <a href=""http://goo.gl/AL5Cj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/AL5Cj</a>. The spreadsheet was done before the most recent AWS price reductions so the m1.small prices aren't right.<p>For worker servers I recommend using PiCloud. You can install anything you want and they only charge you for the time your jobs use. Granted you have to use Python to interface with jobs but does that really matter in the grand scheme. I personally use Python anyways so its a bonus. Depending on the job it might be more appropriate to use AWS' Elastic MapReduce offering.<p>For database servers I recommend using either RDS or Xeround (<a href=""http://www.xeround.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xeround.com</a>) a MySQL provider if you have to use a relational database. If you have the luxury of using a NoSQL option then use Cloudant (<a href=""http://www.cloudant.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudant.com</a>) a CouchDB DBaaS company or AWS' DynamoDB server.<p>For caching servers use AWS' Elasticache service or Garantia Data's (<a href=""http://www.garantiadata.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garantiadata.com</a>) Memcached or Redis cloud.",1360075560

5170799,comment,5168722,5168873,1,0,nitinag,,,"Registrar here (Misk.com). Wanted to share some information on the restore fees discussion. Yes, registries charge hefty restore fees. Using .com as an example (since it can be different for each extension), there is a renewal grace period that can last up to 45 days (we delete at 40 days). Once the name is deleted, the name goes into redemption for 30 days after that. This is where the high fees are hit due to the registry. The thing to note is that some registrars no longer delete names after the renewal grace period ends and  pass the name into an auction system. Hence the name never goes into the real redemption period. In those cases the name is still in the renewal grace period and charging higher redemption fees is a business decision by that company. You can tell if this is the case if after a registrar's redemption period, anything happens to the name except becoming available to register by the public (after a 5 day pending delete at the registry). The real redemption period is 30 days and is reflected in the whois record. Domains should still be renewed before expiration since things could change at any level and there is no reason to risk it.<p>Here are the expiration policies I could find for GoDaddy, Namecheap, and Misk.com (us):<p><a href=""http://support.godaddy.com/help/article/608/what-is-your-process-for-handling-expired-domain-names"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.godaddy.com/help/article/608/what-is-your-pro...</a><p><a href=""http://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/242/35/what-is-domain-redemption-status"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/...</a><p><a href=""https://www.misk.com/kb/domain-expiration-policy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.misk.com/kb/domain-expiration-policy</a>",1360075052

But this law seems to go a bit too far and make things a bit too difficult.<p>According to the linked article, the person you're requesting to remove the data is also liable for any third parties that have it - and should take reasonable steps to ensure they remove it. Can you imagine the logistics of Twitter removing every reference to all tweets by xyz in a timely fashion? How about Google removing data from their search engine and making sure any number of aggregators etc also remove it? How can a company even know what's being done with public data? The law says personal data - there's certainly people sharing personal data publicly, making this effectively impossible to enforce.<p>The EU are right to be thinking about how to apply their privacy directive to the internet age - the current situation isn't working. However, they need to be a bit sensible here and realise that when data has been made public with a person's permission (eg Tweeted), it's that person's responsibility, not eg Twitter's.<p>EDIT: That's not even considering backups etc - we expect these services to work, so it's reasonable to expect and permit them to make backups. If I want to be forgotten with a reasonable degree of confidence, I'd need them to delete information about me from all their backups too. Maybe your average Wordpress blog doesn't have a nightly backup, but if it's picked up by a tech site/Reddit/HN, you can be sure they do - so I'd want it deleted from all of their backups too.<p>An unenforceable law that claims that people have more protection than is technically reasonably possible is not an improvement in my opinion - people should know what's happening with their data, and shifting whose lying/misleading from companies to Government is not an improvement.",1360073392

With an enterprise agreement, you amortize the license cost over 3 years, and pay only maintenance year 4 and 5 (typically 20-25% of the initial annual cost), so you can make the Microsoft TCO much better.

Not to embarrass him (the first time), but a simple ""this sucks and here's why"" kind of non-emotional response.  It's the kind of thing you have to be prepared to deliver- maybe even rehearsed (we all have those situations in our lives that take us by such surprise that we're stunned for a while).<p>It's entirely possible that the guy thought he was being funny, has no idea he wasn't and genuinely finds women painful because he's so ignorant.  By adopting the role of teacher, you may win a valuable ally.<p>But there is a more subtle effect here (if you're still reading and haven't thrown something at the monitor yet).  This response from you, if you do it the way I have in mind (even if I'm not articulating it properly), will be entirely <i>patronizing</i>, in fact it will be patronizing in <i>exactly the way men like this patronize you</i> (and I know you know what I'm talking about-- see below).  It is delivered from a position of strength, not weakness, in the sense that you are giving sage advice:  is he smart enough to see it?  Some will be, some won't.<p>Beyond this, remember to trust your gut.  Sometimes the guy is just an asshole (a big clue is if other guys think he's an asshole) and words like I've written above are totally off-the-mark for the situation.<p>My wife is in a male-dominated (at her level) role, and I hear these stories all the time.  Sometimes my advice is helpful- often she tells me to just STFU and listen.  YMMV.",1360072871

It's easy to be a customer of NameCheap and assume they are a reseller or that eNom is the parent. If that's not the case, they have some work to do to clarify things. That said, I'm a happy customer.",1360072833

If this line of thought carries over into coding it might be true that higher quality doesn&#x27;t mean higher value.<p>In the first season of the Apprentice the two teams had to renovate and flip an apartment. One team kept their apartment a three bedroom and the other team took out a wall and made theirs a two bedroom. The two bedroom apartment was a lot nicer but it was also worth less than the three bedroom and they ended up in the boardroom with someone getting fired. This is another example of something being higher quality but not necessarily higher value.<p>Sure, there are a lot of people who create wealth by adding value, but the whole point of OP&#x27;s article on Bloomberg is that the people who are adding value are not getting the share of that wealth. While there are lots of people earning $127,000 a year and getting $350,000 a year or two after their startup&#x27;s IPO, they are not making the type of wealth people with 10s and 100s of million dollars are. Do you think Larry Page and Sergey Brin are writing code right now? Probably not. Most likely they are looking for companies for sale that are under valued or added to the Alphabet family will increase the value. I was just pointing out that the state of mind of people making deals when they wake up in the morning isn&#x27;t motivated by the money, they are motivated by making the the best deal and money is just a side effect. Fundamentally, they are allocating resources, they might not necessarily be creating value. They value is already present in the product or company, they just gain an edge at the game when they understand that product or company is, interestingly enough, under valued.<p>If people are not passionate about what they are doing, they are just wasting their time. And, my experience is people who are worth 10s and 100s of millions of dollars are passionate about making deals because that is all they do all day. People shouldn&#x27;t write code because it will make them a millionaire. If people really want to be a millionaire they should make deals, even then they still have to be passionate about that game.",1450428736

I had left a startup within the past few weeks then, and was seriously burnt out of 60-80 hour weeks, heavy dose of blame abuse, & product cycles where a sales person could never say no to a customer request.<p>I ended up taking an offer less than half as much as the top end, but mostly for non-monetary reasons. I came to the conclusion that money wasn&#x27;t vitally important to me beyond a healthy amount to live comfortably & pay off my debts, and I wanted the flexibility to leave work early, not live in constant pressure to have stories done yesterday, and in general live a more normal life with actual vacation I could take without guilt. It also gave me more freedom to explore software development at my own desire, as there is always more to learn and improve on.<p>I may start a company in the future, or enter the grind again, but for now I&#x27;m happier spending time with friends and enjoying the fruits of my labor.

I can&#x27;t blame them much though, because Yahoo and Bing suck as well. But then Bing&#x27;s index is in fact the only competition Google has and DuckDuckGo cannot improve as long as they depend on Bing.<p>One favorite example that I&#x27;ve been using for feedback is when I&#x27;m searching for &quot;restaurante&quot; (the Romanian word for &quot;restaurants&quot;), in Google Search I&#x27;m getting links to nearby restaurants. Which is normal since they&#x27;ve got my location and so on. But they also know that in my country (Romania) the people are speaking Romanian and so they are showing me results in the Romanian language of restaurants from my city.<p>On the other hand in DuckDuckGo:<p>1. The instant answer is terribly wrong, mistakenly identifying a plain vocabulary word from at least 3 romance languages (!!!) as being the name of some insignificant 1-star GitHub project that nobody cares about. Ouch!<p>2. Even though the region selected is Romania, aproximately the first eleven results contain the translation of the word &quot;restaurante&quot; from Spanish, a link to some &quot;el Restaurante&quot; magazine I&#x27;ve never heard about and a link to some latin restaurant named Kuuk from Mexico, plus a &quot;Top 10 Berlin Restaurants&quot; (needless to say Berlin is not in Romania)<p>3. Out of 30 links I get, none of them is related to Romanian restaurants, Romanian cuisine, or anything related to Romania, even though the selected region is Romania and that word is a Romanian word.<p>4. OK, lets assume that some users searching for &quot;restaurante&quot; are interested in Spanish results. Well, one problem would be that Mexico is different from Spain, but lets ignore that as well. The biggest problem is that this set of results is completely useless for Spanish speakers as well.",1450427872

10757394,comment,10756966,10756966,0,0,mymotta,,,"Good and important questions with broad implications for your company. Your current business model is a subscription-based offer of SaaS. You also offer a hosted API under a subscription model. If I understand correctly, access to the API is not usage based. Rather, you currently host the API on your company servers and provide a subscription to use this API via some variably-priced and tiered RESTful interface. So, the questions you ask can be re-stated as follows: should we also offer, alongside the subscription model, a RTU (right-to-use) license-based model for your product. But more is needed that adds significant complexity: you are also being asked to provide source code for integration with the customer&#x27;s code base. If you agree to provide such a source license to your code, how do you price such an offer?<p>My first advice is that you should consider pricing mechanics as secondary. The primary issue is business model; whether and how you can work in the very different worlds at the same time. You need to sort through the issues carefully. The SaaS model is very different from the more traditional license-based software offers. I won&#x27;t repeat the abundance of thinking on this here other than to say that  (a) metrics you use to measure and guide your success for the SaaS offering are very different from what you will need for a license model, (b) the deployment model for SaaS is very different from source-based licenses. For SaaS, you have complete control over your code base, how and when to issue revisions to your cloud-based services. You have zero control over the source distribution, (c) product support processes are very different between the models, because in the source code model you need to understand the customer&#x27;s code too! etc., etc...<p>Let me suggest that you DO NOT offer the source license model alongside of your SaaS subscription model. They are different enough to make it very hard to manage the baseline jointly for both offers. And, the significant additional complication of source-based licensing will make it nearly impossible to manage together. I think this &quot;opportunity&quot; is a sure way to kill your SaaS company.<p>Rather, you can consider for the particular customer a ONE-TIME SOURCE CODE LICENSING deal, where you sell the source as-is. To make is easier for the customer you can provide some nice documentation on internal frameworks and interfaces. Make sure that you write careful language in the contract to ensure that the customer will not compete with you in your primary business areas (this may not be trivial). Pricing must have NO RELATIONSHIP whatsoever with your SaaS pricing model. It should be based on value of the solution to the particular customer. Once you have this number, double it. Then include pricing for 1 year support (with some bounds, e.g., not more than, say, 10 hours per month) for a fixed fee and an option for the customer to buy additional support for $$ per hour beyond the built-in 10 hours.<p>If you want to eat Indian food, don&#x27;t go to an Italian restaurant.<p>good luck",1450427795

We see it primarily as a way to allow non-coders to build a lot of the game logic. As programmers, we make reusable entities which are then connected to each other in a visual environment. Working in this environment requires little understanding of technical matters.<p>It&#x27;s certainly not perfect. In practice, I quickly found that it adds a new level of obfuscation, due to the physical constraints of the 2D-space in which it is being visualized. In short, it easily becomes a mess of tangled connections and sometimes you may have difficulty physically locating the block you want to interact with.<p>Still, there&#x27;s not a doubt in my mind that this is a great tool. Not a great tool for a team of programmers, but a great tool for a game studio as a whole. It allows designers and artists with limited technical knowledge to prototype game modes and develop user interfaces, without involving any programmers. Sure, they may need some help from software engineers who create new entities or guide them towards a cleaner design. The end result is still impressive: non-coders are building large parts of the game logic in a very intuitive way which requires no knowledge of code of any kind.<p>In essence, I see this type of language not as an alternative to writing code, but as an amazing tool allowing non-coders to to develop large portions of a program&#x27;s functionality. Naturally, my own experience is essentially limited to the niche of game development. I don&#x27;t know how useful this would be in developing, say, a website centered around an online shopping portal.",1450427632

But corruption can only thrive in the dark and my hope is that the internet will allow a light to be shined in the dark corners of both developed and developing nations.<p>Maybe the ultimate question we should ask is why individual people feel the need to accumulate enormous sums of wealth, at all.  My opinion is that it is the result of deep-seated fears about &quot;losing everything&quot; and ending up impoverished.  Until societies can guarantee EVERY citizen a right to food and shelter, regardless of the ability of the person to create income, the citizens of that society will manifest their fear in the form of hording and, sometimes, corruption.<p>I have no problem with people like Bill Gates earning vast amounts of money by adding value to the world, but we can allow individuals to accumulate that sort of wealth while still proving a safety net for every individual in society.  Perhaps this safety net will assuage the fear that, I believe, ultimately inspires at least a good portion of corruption.<p>Despite all of humanity&#x27;s achievements, we are still living like animals, ruled by fear, where the law of the jungle still reigns.",1450426590

The same goes for states that have low corruption today, that is not a guarantee for low corruption in the future.<p>China is interesting in this respect, on the one hand corruption is rife, on the other it is nominally totally out of bounds and the punishments are severe.

Build mostly from ridiculous over-sized and thick bricks. But very sturdy. Don&#x27;t remember hearing neighbors unless they raised an extreme ruckus (usually getting drunk and yelling at each other or kids stumping screaming while playing).<p>Then lived a newer (built in the early 90s concrete block 9 story building). Much nicer, big windows, larger rooms. Wall not as thick but still very sturdy and don&#x27;t remember hearing my neighbours same as above. Windows were letting cold air through in the winter and elevator kept breaking often but sound proofing was find and no cracks or structural issues that I remember.",1403578765

This is applicable when a unit owner decides to sell their unit and the purchaser cannot get a nice low-cost loan.

After all, the number of technical founders who can effectively sell is small, so most of them have a single point of failure too, just on the other side of the business.<p>The harsh truth is that lot of non-technical founders set themselves up for failure precisely because they&#x27;re limited to the pool of developers who will consider a co-founder relationship.

7935967,comment,7926555,7931081,1,0,logicchains,,,"Anarchism literally means (in the original Greek) &#x27;no ruler&#x27;; anarcho-capitalism fits that definition, no?<p>It&#x27;s impossible for people to communicate if they aren&#x27;t both using the same definitions of particular words. It&#x27;s not &#x27;overcomplexification&#x27; to clearly define the terms used, it&#x27;s a necessary step in having a non-nonsensical conversational interchange.<p>In this case, the issue is over &#x27;forced&#x27;. When you state &quot;a person today without property (or capital) is indirectly forced to rent out his or her labor&quot;, you&#x27;re referring to them being forced by circumstance, not by anyone actively setting out to deprive them of food. Whether or not to consider this (or anything else) a bad thing is a moral judgement. Moral judgements require philosophical analysis.<p>I&#x27;m pointing out that, in the context of the viewpoint that only actively forcing people (i.e. do this or I&#x27;ll hit you) is bad, what you describe as a &#x27;non-forced&#x27; choice involves force against other parties, but the &#x27;indirectly forced&#x27; choice doesn&#x27;t. How? If a person is born without enough land or capital to be self-sufficient, and all the land and capital in the world at their time of birth was already used by others, then giving them enough land or capital to be self-sufficient would necessarily (assuming it wasn&#x27;t given voluntarily through charity) require direct force to take the land/capital of others to give to this person.<p>I understand the distinction between private-property and possessions; that&#x27;s what I was referring to as the biggest distinction between left anarchism (or if you&#x27;d prefer, anarchism) and right anarchism (or if you&#x27;d prefer, arch libertarianism). Which side of the fence one falls on seems to depend on one&#x27;s particular philosophical views towards private property, which I attempted to illustrate with the thought experiment I described previously.",1403578148

7935955,comment,7932642,7932642,8,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Looks nice. I particularly like the ORM, which seems well-designed compared to ActiveRecord.<p>That said, I have a distinct feeling this is too little, too late. I and my teams have long migrated away from frameworks, to microservices, or what some people call SOA, and we are not looking back. I strongly encourage this design over the old monolithic Rails approach.<p>These are mostly small, highly specialized Sinatra backends that speak data only through REST APIs. For such backends, you don&#x27;t need views, and you hardly need models; when &quot;deconstructing&quot; your data model into multiple backends, the data model for each microservice often becomes absurdly simple. Mostly you need a simple way to express REST endpoints. Sinatra is very simple and doesn&#x27;t support any abstraction, but that&#x27;s mostly a good thing. And you can split your API across multiple files easily. The backends are getting so simple that it&#x27;s starting to look very tempting to migrate to Go, where we could get real performance and concurrency.<p>On the front end, I would still use Sinatra if it were a classic app -- you can cobble together a &quot;railsy&quot; app with Sinatra by picking your template system, database layer and so on -- but mostly these days we build Node.js single-page apps that are sewn together with NPM and Browserify. Web app development has never been as simple and elegant as it is when done this way.",1403577890

This can either happen at/during compilation (e.g. generating documentation) or after the code has already been compiled and linked (such as a virus scanner). However, I haven&#x27;t heard of static analysis ever being used to infer the computational complexity of a program or to estimate how long a program will take to run. Of course, there&#x27;s always branching conditions within a program, but machines are strictly causal, so given some initial state and an input it should be possible to estimate the runtime of a program.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m being naive but does a tool like this exist? Is it even possible to use this sort of analysis to estimate, even if imprecisely, the computational complexity of a program?",1403575971

There is the russian roulette aspect of probability, and then there is failure from lack of character. Unfortunately, outsiders can&#x27;t see or relate to the important distinctions. This makes dealling with use a bit more cognitive overhead--and that&#x27;s what sucks. Explaining things to folks on the outside who don&#x27;t have the inclination or understanding to care.

4805210,comment,4803620,4803738,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting take on it. One of the setups I use has a Mimo touch monitor [1] which is attached via USB. Putting the tool bar for my CAD program on that monitor sized up, gives me a screen with all of the tools available, and I can use the entire space on my 'main' screen for drawing. My version isn't multi-touch which would be useful for doing view projections.<p>I realized that sort of the 'ideal' setup here is a keyboard, and then behind the keyboard a really wide and not too tall multi-touch display, and then vertically in front of me 1, 2, or 3 IPS high density displays. That would move the richer expression of touch gestures to a place that was halfway between my keyboard and my screens.<p>Like Jeff that opened me up to the notion of a 'hybrid' interaction model. Prior to that experience with the 'all-in-one' style machines was just frustrating. The conflict between wanting the large monitor set back, and then having to reach out and touch it was a challenge.<p>Amazingly far from 25 x 80 characters on a green (or amber) screen :-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mimomonitors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mimomonitors.com/</a>",1353344360

4805204,comment,4800776,4803184,1,0,ahoyhere,,,"Yup, getting started with healthcare was stressful (so we used an agent) and hiring our first employees wasn't stressful but firing them both was. So was getting our (personal) mortgage  that tied my guts in knots for weeks.<p>But then, like the mortgage, the healthcare and hiring/firing was over and life went back to normal. We didn't have to keep up ""a good front"" so people wouldn't jump ship, or worry about whether we could make salary, or any of those things. Nobody was breathing down our neck to do any of this, either -- we did them because we chose to. And we were able to make decisions on our own, without having to consult or sell anybody, to change the way we did these things so it wouldn't be stressful next time. For example, shutting down a product which would require us to hire too many people to run effectively, rather than take that on.<p>That's the power of ownership -- the bad shit passes, and you have the power to avoid it altogether in the future.<p>Now if you're not making any money, that is another kind of stress, but because we served a hungry market with a product that delivers value (and did a good job of marketing it), we didn't have that problem.",1353344229

4805170,comment,4804467,4804994,6,0,ajross,,,"Right, they're playing the game and have competetive parts.  What the ARM-is-the-future people fail to recognize is that the x86 world isn't remotely dead.  Relative to consumer SoCs, Intel makes <i>shockingly high</i> margins on its desktop and server silicon.  It simply doesn't make sense for them to be making high volume embedded chips unless they have excess fab capacity (which they don't).<p>The Medfield chips are performance-competetive with existing parts, though they aren't stand-outs.  But even if, say, they had a mythical chip that would get lets-just-say-for-argument 2x the performance of Tegra 3 or A6 at 50% of the power draw, <i>they would still not be manufacturing it in volume</i>, for the simple reason that Ivy Bridge cores make a whole lot more money for them than a Tegra-killer would.<p>So from an investor's perspective, Intel is doing exactly the right thing.  Stay in the game, don't cede the market.  Make sure your products are competetive, but don't walk away from easy cash either.<p>Long term, their success will be driven by the value of their SoC products as the desktop world dissolves.

The C++ standard has some serious deficiencies that make it harder to write reliable code (and forget maintenance).  Part of the problem is that the C++ standard is written with compiler writers in mind, rather than with C++ users in mind, and so some things (like not unwinding the stack until an exception is caught, thus avoiding the double exception fault) are not done, and new problems are simply layered on (like causing the default behavior for exceptions propagating out of destructors to be program termination).<p>At this point, C++ should be placed in the same category as COBOL:  it is a language you learn because you need to maintain some old code that nobody has time to rewrite or replace.",1353343841

I don't have much experience with the word processing document formats, but every tool I've used that worked with the old Excel BIFF8 format failed hard. BIFF8 was never officially released as a standard, so everyone's work was the result of reverse engineering. The results were really bad.<p>We recently started the transition from the old Spreadsheet (Ruby) gem, which targeted BIFF8 format, to the Axlsx gem, which targets OOXML format. The results are so, so much better. Spreadsheets generated with the old Spreadsheet gem work presentationally, but features of Excel are broken when you open the resulting documents. We also ran in to issues when generating very large documents with lots of formatting. All of these problems are gone with Axlsx.",1353343039

I have a lexer for Erlang written with Boost.Spirit on my Github. I found debugging no worse than the general Chutulu-horror that are C++ template errors, something you get used to, looking at the root of the spew is generally your best bet. Also they have built in debug nodes you can trivially add to your grammar that will spew every step of the lexing/parsing process so you can easily see where things are going off the rails if your grammar is wrong. Compile times are definitely increased in my experience, don't recall the binary bloat though it has been awhile since I played around with it, a good compiler should be able to fairly aggressively trim it down.

However, there are no ads which Gmail needs and imagine if Gmail didn't need adds they would use their real estate more wisely as in your design.<p>I use Chrome, which allows you to add styles to custom.css to override the look of any website. As such I'm able to add my own styles to customize the look of Gmail to look cleaner, hide ads and customize like in your mockup. If you package the new look as a Browser Plugin to restyle Gmail, then yes I would use it, but now I would not pay for it.<p>If you are attempting to recreate gmail itself, then also no I would never use it. Because once again this only offers an improvement in design. Gmail is great compared because of Google. Aka, best spam prevention, far better than Apple, Yahoo and Outlook and scaleability and up-time. There is simply no way you can compete with the resources Google has. Which is why even Apple who has incredible resources and Money and amazing design sense still can't compete with Gmail's infrastructure and servers.<p>There is a market for retheming however, whether in the web interface or through Apps such as with Sparrow.<p>So in reality stick with theming Gmail and be aware that Gmail can change their look at any time and that you won't get any direct money out of it but will get your name out there.

I do remember we had some pressure from sponsors to do things like drive traffic to their websites, I was all for returning the cash and doing without their support because it was so annoying, we were creating a space for the community to gather and talk about Agile development using Rails and if we weren't driving traffic maybe they needed to make their product more compelling instead of blaming us. ;)<p>If I had still been on the team I would have been arguing strongly to tell the nay sayers to get their own ass in gear and submit proposals, or shut up, assuming they weren't themselves the white guys they seem to see everywhere.<p>The reason for sponsorship was to keep the ticket cost somewhere affordable by the jobbing developer, while still being able to pay for accommodation for the speakers. I know that a lot of people will come and talk anyway, self funding, but it's a big ask if you want some of the leaders from the US to come. Plus the cost of decent sized venues in Manchester is not cheap. Putting on Magrails cost a lot, let me tell you, and we have less than 100 left in the bank account.",1353342294
4805022,comment,4804219,4804219,3,0,znowi,,,"ESA is in a difficult situation to compete with a privately owned, agile, startup in spirit company. I suspect ESA is not much different to NASA in operation. And as Musk pointed out, the latter has two major problems: 1) fear of innovation and 2) inefficient production. First is a catch 22 where no components can be used in space unless proven to work in space. Second is multiple chains of subcontractors until you reach a manufacturing process. It's fine tuned to cash extraction, not product efficiency.<p>I looked up some numbers. Falcon 9 costs about $5k per kg to launch. Falcon Heavy is expected at almost $2k. While competitors run at $10k and more. The only viable competitor seems to be the Russians with their trusted Soyuz and Angara series, currently in development.",1353342284

4805013,comment,4804578,4804854,1,0,yannickt,,,"Using your example let's assume myBar and myBaz are _owned_ by Foo. Before C++11 you would typically do this:<p><pre><code>   class Foo {
   public:
      Foo() : myBar(0), myBaz(0)
      {
         myBar = new Bar;
         myBaz = new Baz;
      }
      ~Foo
      {
         if (myBar) delete myBar;
         if (myBaz) delete myBaz;
      }
   private:
      Bar *myBar;
      Baz *myBaz;
   };
</code></pre>
In C++11, the above could be written like this:<p><pre><code>   class Foo {
   public:
      Foo() : myBar(new Bar), myBaz(new Baz)
      {
      }
   private:
      std::unique_ptr<Bar> myBar;
      std::unique_ptr<Baz> myBaz;
   };
</code></pre>
You don't need to call delete because the unique_ptr destructor will do it for you.<p>You would only need to use shared_ptr when ownership is shared among multiple objects. A shared_ptr holds a reference counter that is incremented every time it is copied, and decremented every time it is destroyed or re-assigned. When the reference counter reaches zero, the pointer is automatically deleted.",1353342213

There's very little difference between that remediation and ""Turn off Facebook Likes web-wide, please."" and that proposal (presumably) is an auto-fail at FB.",1353341749

The team faced rejection from Kickstarter just one short week ago, after that crowdfunding platform changed its hardware project rules to minimize their role in the overall platform mix. Now its back, and the team tells me theyre confident that going it alone in the manner of App.net and Lockitron will help make sure that Lumawake makes it to market.",1353340819

4804876,comment,4803796,4804685,1,0,timeshifter,,,"> Frankly, I think you do many entrepreneurs an injustice in assuming that I'm talking about VC funded entrepreneurs only. At my talk at University of Chicago I repeated advice I give every time I speak ""90+% of you should never raise VC. It's not right for you. Better that you raise smaller amounts of money and keep control of your business.""<p>Except you didn't mention that in this post. You <i>did</i>, however, say:<p>>Whats it really like being an entrepreneur?<p>You are making a very clear point. You are talking to entrepreneurs, period. You make no mention of what ""type"", of what budget, of what size, of what scope, of what <i>anything</i> you are actually talking about. And then you say:<p>>Youre unemployable. Youre an entrepreneur.<p>Which I will happily call bullshit on. You started a company? Great, you've got at least some experience into management or what it takes. That's a <i>good</i> thing. So why do you think that makes one unemployable?<p>>Bitch, you don't know me. Don't assume you do.<p>No, I don't. I can only venture that you're an elitist by your blog post, and this defense of it based on aspects that you mention <i>elsewhere</i>, but not in this post. So... why don't you keep your tongue in check? I get the feeling it might help.",1353340806

8617537,comment,8616952,8617475,0,0,gregjor,,,"The 10X productivity thing may be a myth. What I&#x27;ve seen in 35+ years programming is developers fall into three broad categories:<p>1. Can&#x27;t get <i>anything</i> done on schedule or in budget.
2. May <i>eventually</i> get something done, late and over budget.
3. Delivers what the customer needs on time and within budget.<p>The first two groups just cost the customer time and money, create uncertainty and stress for the customer, and may or may not deliver something of value. A better developer doesn&#x27;t have to be 10x better (however that is measured). They only have to deliver what the customer needs within the time and budget parameters.<p>From the customer&#x27;s point of view the relevant scale is not 1 - 5 - 10 times productivity from the developer. The relevant scale is 0 - 1, where anything much less than 1 means their business problems weren&#x27;t addressed in a useful way. It doesn&#x27;t really matter that one programmer had 10x more commits on GitHub than another programmer if the customer can&#x27;t ship packages because the programmer didn&#x27;t correctly add shipping charges to the invoice (real example).<p>Anyone who is freelancing, leading a project or team, or calling themselves a ninja, rockstar, wizard, etc. should not be surprised or indignant that customers don&#x27;t understand their requirements and usually can&#x27;t communicate their needs in a complete and consistent format. That problem has been known since the 1950s. Blaming the customer is not an option. An effective developer will concentrate on business needs, ask the questions and get the answers, and work with the customer to nail down requirements.<p>When I get involved with a broken/stalled project the first thing I do is ask the customer to make a short list of the problems and missing features in decreasing priority order. What I always get, without exception, are <i>business</i> requirements, not technical glitches. The root cause of a missing business requirement may be technical (e.g. failed PCI compliance audit because of vulnerable PHP code), but all the customer cares about is the business requirement. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I am 10x faster or smarter than whomever was working on the code before as long as I can fix the problem.",1416218269

  It was not until Hellman watched Day After Trinity,
  a documentary about the development of the atomic 
  bomb, that he realized how dangerous his decision-
  making process had been. The moment in the film that 
  troubled him most, he recalled, was when the Manhattan 
  Project scientists tried to explain why they continued 
  to work on the bomb after Hitler had been defeated and 
  the threat of a German atom bomb had disappeared. The 
  scientists “had figured out what they wanted to do and

I am not writing on behalf of 10X, these are my own opinions.<p><i>I would think that people hiring would like potential hires to be unrepresented. An un-represented developer is going to be cheaper. (chrisbennet)</i><p>Price is just one factor. If I charge twice as much as someone else but I can solve the customer&#x27;s problem in one-fourth the time, the customer saves money. Customers are usually focused on solving business problems within their budget and schedule, not just on hourly rates.<p><i>It&#x27;s not about the technology. It never has been. You&#x27;re number one mission whenever you get a contract is to understand the business and figure out how you can get them making more money. (aantix)</i><p>Almost exactly right. It&#x27;s not always about making more money, though; it may just be to figure out how to make their software do what it is supposed to do. Too many job postings and too many résumés list technologies without addressing business needs or experience. For me, 10X has been good at getting both sides to talk about and describe business requirements and setting clear deliverables and goals.<p><i>Boy. As someone who actually runs a contracting + project agency, that looks to be of an approximately similar size as 10x (at least before this was published), this was lifting-cars-painful to read - not just because they have PR and I don&#x27;t, but because they (Solomon and Blumberg) _are the inefficiencies they are pretending to eliminate_. (scottru)</i><p>The New Yorker article was not an exhaustive description of how 10X works or who does what. Most of my interaction with 10X is with Michael Solomon, so to say he isn&#x27;t adding any value is just not understanding what he does. Everyone at 10X is adding value for me, and the several 10X customers I work for or have worked for have without exception said only good things about 10X Management. In my experience most projects go wrong due to miscommunication and conflicting expectations. 10X, and specifically Michael, are good at heading those things off before they become problems, and working out solutions that are acceptable to both sides.<p>Yes, 10X has had some great PR. No, they aren&#x27;t the only good freelancer agency or consulting firm. I&#x27;ve worked for quite a few placement/consulting firms and with many recruiters in my career (35+ years) and for the work I do now and the life I want to live 10X is a great fit. It may not be the right fit for every client (freelancer) or customer, and it may not be the way to go if you want to try to make millions at a startup.<p>A few years ago I decided to concentrate on stalled projects and broken code, the almost-working or somewhat broken stuff left behind when developers fall out with their customer and stop answering their emails. My customers are mostly smaller businesses and non-profits, without the need or resources for their own IT staff, and without the sex appeal of Facebook or Twitter. They have real business problems to solve, they can&#x27;t throw everything away and start over, and they aren&#x27;t qualified to recruit and hire technical staff. I found plenty of this work on my own, but when I decided to travel and freelance remotely I worried about finding customers and easing their fears about hiring someone living overseas. 10X has been a good fit for me -- they bring in plenty of customers, they have clients with every technical skill you can think of when I need help, and they are a real US-based company that can assure customers I will deliver no matter where I happen to be. They have also negotiated better rates and more useful contracts that I was doing on my own.",1416216102

Also assume that you have 10000s of products, 100s with completely different attributes, 1000s of distinct attributes across all products.<p>Now you want to add a search feature that allows to search for products based on these attributes (like &quot;give me all products where screen_size=37 inches&quot;)<p>If you don&#x27;t have any traditional columns with indexes you can use to limit the amount of rows, that query will either cause a sequence scan over all products, or you will have to create a functional index over the screen_size field in your JSON document which then only covers screen_size, but not, say, the disk_size.<p>This will mean that you will have to create 1000s of indexes (one for every custom attribute) which also means that you lose a lot of flexibility: Adding a new custom attribute now means that you have to add another index (or you&#x27;ll suddenly have to deal with unexpected sequence scans).<p>Using jsonb and a gin index, you need exactly one index to find arbitrary key/value combinations in your json document, giving you the flexibility of trivially adding new attributes but just storing that in the json document.",1416215443

I know both personally, have seen their code and previous work, and trust them to have given a pessimistic estimate.<p>If you have tight, modular code following good practices (e.g. a relational backend, not an ORM), you have experience doing it before, there&#x27;s no micro-manager, and with a clearly defined, functional spec, you can build robust things that scale well relatively quickly. We&#x27;re not talking about a new Facebook here, merely copying 80% of the functionality of an existing product for a launch in markets with no competition, as greenfield. Also, it&#x27;s not like a site like that would reach a million users in a couple of months, nor would it win design awards, but why should it? It just needs to process transactions accurately and list a bunch of shops across a few countries.<p>I do think that the global market for programming talent is like that for real estate here in Singapore: I pay around 2 grand a month, and my neighbours across the street something like 8-10 for the same space. It is what it is. You&#x27;d be amazed how &quot;cheap&quot; it can be to hire a greybeard these days, sometimes less than twice a fresh Stanford grad...",1416215403

I used to buy about 30 CDs a year, and then a similar number of albums on iTunes, and now there&#x27;s Spotify, and that&#x27;s all I use now.<p>I am probably the Worst Person On The Internet for the following view, but supporting the artists falls fairly low on my priority list, and certainly wasn&#x27;t the reason I was buying CDs. For smaller acts, I&#x27;d have thought (citation needed) that the promotional power of Spotify for concerts and so on is worthwhile.<p>For larger acts, how much extra monetary support do they need, especially given how much cash concerts bring in? Would they stop producing music if they were making a decent middle class wage instead of millions of dollars?<p>Would we be in a better place if libraries didn&#x27;t exist, and authors made super-normal profits as a result? Probably not. I pay for books for the same reason I pay for Spotify - the convenience of having the book I want, when I want it, rather than trudging down to my local library, and getting a dog-eared copy that smells of tobacco. But I note the cost of a book - especially for the Kindle - is really quite different from most CDs I&#x27;ve seen.<p>I have a friend who&#x27;s a very talented backing musician who tours around playing guitar for the latest TV contest winners, and I note he&#x27;s compensated on similar terms to talented developers I know who show up at companies and solve other people&#x27;s problems.",1416215258

That&#x27;s a death spiral that is only going to get worse.<p>The government of Japan is plainly bankrupt. People that own Japanese government debt are already being paid back in devalued Yen. The only options left for Japan are to either openly default, or dramatically increase the debasement of the Yen - the last option is exactly what they will choose. So rather than an open default, they will default by destroying their currency.<p>Abenomics will be followed by a call for Abenomics 2, and a more dramatic destruction of the Yen. Japan has been living on borrowed time for 15+ years, maintaining a fake standard of living that was dependent on perpetually greater amounts of debt; the bill has come due.

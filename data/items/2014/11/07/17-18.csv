Why not just experiment with this as library for javascript functions? Downloading the code from the &quot;global database&quot; would be provided by a function:<p>getDataByHash(hash) : Blob<p>To load the code into the return use eval (blech), or back up a step and use script tag + an advanced version of magnet links I&#x27;d call snow links:<p><script src=&quot;snow:?xt=urn:sha2:beaaca...&quot;></script><p>There will have to be a dom-scanning/watching js library that the pages load from a normal url which scans the page for snow links, downloads them by calling getDataByHash(), and then swaps in new URLs using URL.createObjectURL(Blob).<p>This leads me in a somewhat orthogonal direction to your post...<p>Obviously any element in the page that loads resources would benefit from this (link rel=stylesheet, img, iframe, etc) so the document-scanner should work it&#x27;s magic on them as well.<p>To me the tricky part becomes &quot;the global database.&quot; There are several ways to implement it. My thought would be to build it as a DHT on top of Web-RTC. I&#x27;d look into webtorrent, it has to scale from very small to very large files. Maybe have multiple different DHTs that the scanner will try.<p>Storing stuff in the DHT ought to be as simple as declaring to the network that data (or solution) of a given hash is known. Clients p2p connect over to the knower (or daisy chain style as a sort of ad-hoc STUN/TURN setup?), and virally spread the data by declaring they too now have the solution for the hash they just downloaded. A CDN can still store a file and can be listed as a fallback provider in the snow url.<p>As an example application:<p>Once this DHT exists and p2p is built on top of it should not be hard to ask peers to run the content of a given SHA and return the result (or they will return it&#x27;s SHA if it&#x27;s large, effectively memo-izing the function). Something like:<p>run(hash) : RunOffer<p>Any peer (AWS or Google etc could implement a peer as well) could respond to that with a offer to run the computation for an amount of p2p currency that scales to billions or trillions of tiny transactions per second.<p>...<p>Anyhow this comment is way too long already, but the ideas keep flowing from here. There are a lot of technical challenges for vital features (like how to register (im)mutable alias for hashes and distribute them to the network without using DNS for authoritative top-level namespacing? how get reliable redundancy guarantees for stored data without resorting to a CDN? What to do about realtime steaming of data where data is produced by an ongoing process? grouping multiple devices for the same user?)<p>All-in-all it seems like being able to get data by the hash of its content from inside of a program (including library code) as easily as loading it from a URL or off the filesystem is pretty useful. It also seems like we can engineer the technology to make this happen, so I think it&#x27;s inevitable and will happen pretty soon.",1415382953

No system tray, no quick launch bar, nothing.<p>(if you&#x27;re not familiar with tiling window managers, they&#x27;re window managers in which windows are arranged automatically to a) fully occupy the screen and b) never overlap. They&#x27;re extremely customizable, but typically you&#x27;ll have a vertical half of your screen with a main app, and the other half with all the other apps &quot;stacked&quot;, with keyboard shortcuts to toggle between them and adjust various parameters (e.g. split orientation). You typically also get virtual desktops. The whole thing is fully keyboard driven (on my Xmonad, cmd + shift + enter opens a new terminal, and cmd + shift + c kills the currently selected window), and once you get used to it it&#x27;s a usability dream).<p>On it, I have 2 graphical applications installed: a terminal emulator, because that&#x27;s where I do all my work (and can launch other minor applications, such as a PDF viewer, if needed), and surf, a tab-less/control-less/URL field-less browser that you launch by typing `surf <url>`.<p>People make fun of me for this weird archaic setup, but it&#x27;s the most productive machine I&#x27;ve ever used. Tiling window managers don&#x27;t get in the way, and make it painful obvious when you have non work stuff open. surf forces me to not fuck around with 15000 irrelevant tabs open. It sounds like it would be a terribly crippled experience, but in practice it does not impede my workflow at all - it keeps me focused. It&#x27;s gotten to the point that when I hear colleagues who complain about all their open tabs and how screwed they would be if their Chrome crashes, I feel like they come from another planet.<p>I don&#x27;t like the whole &quot;have some discipline&quot; argument. Humans are notoriously bad at discipline- environment plays as much of a role as self control (try surrounding the most hardcore fitness nut by candy 24/7 and see how long they last).

Thought crime.<p>Undercover policing only works when the crime to be prevented would have definitely occurred in the absence of the undercover cop.  What they can do effectively is take an potential opportunity and convert it into the illusion of opportunity.<p>So rather than supplying the guy with bomb parts, wait until he has actual bomb parts, and replace them with nonfunctional replicas.  Then you wait for him to press the button.  That way, there is no doubt as to the origin of the criminal intent.  You stopped a real crime instead of abetting a fake one.<p>You can&#x27;t just target someone with motive and trick him into acting on it.

But if you stand there and give out free grenades to people waiting in line, a few of them will have their pins pulled.  If they spit out a puff of confetti instead of flaming death, you haven&#x27;t really prevented any crime.  You just proved that some people hate the DMV.  You could have accomplished the same thing by circulating a petition to lawfully dismantle the bureaucracy.<p>So I disagree that the answer is &quot;just barely&quot;.

It inspired me to rethink the whole way we normally post a job. When looking for skilled likeminded people to join our team we shouldn’t make a job post; rather we should make a “company pitch”. Most job posts are dictating who you are and what you should do – a common sentence in a job post often goes like this: “you got a master degree in computer science and like to...” or “you will develop solution concepts by using...”. We don’t believe in such requirements. We don’t think of you as a work unit in a production line. Rather we seek talents and personalities whom we would want to invest in a relationship with. We firmly believe modern companies need to rethink the way in which they attract similar minded people. We must open our door and introduce our values; as this is the first step towards creating a bond. After all we are the team that want you to join us.<p>With that being said welcome to 3QAYJ.com (www.3QAYJ.com) – our company pitch project to attract you!<p>Our workflow is managed via<p>JIRA,CONFLUENCE<p>and all code submitting is handled through Github, pull request.

Starting from 2015 we will have a real life team summit meeting some place around the world financed by the company.<p>We are currently looking at expanding our development team with 1-2 backend developers.<p>Job description<p>Here is a list of some of the tools and technologize we currently use:<p>- Nginx<p>- git<p>- Capistrano<p>- compass (scss)<p>- coffeescript (a little bit)<p>We&#x27;d appreciate if you have experience with the above or you can study how to use it.<p>We appreciate if you have:<p>- skills in Magento development<p>- skills in web development in general<p>- skills or at least wants to get skills in mobile applications development (Android/iOS)<p>Good confirmations of your professionalism could be:<p>- your github account with contributions to open source projects<p>- any certificates (Magento MCD/MCDP, ZCE and so on)<p>- your stackoverflow account<p>If applying we would ask you to send us an example of code written by you and make a short pair programming session with one of our developers.<p>What we offer<p>- Long term full employment<p>- Flexible working hours<p>- Remote job - Work from your home<p>- Influence in all aspect of your work – freedom in ways to resolve tasks<p>- Respect your opinion/ support your own projects<p>- Stability and personal relationship<p>- Fully paid Team summit meeting each year.<p>Your Application<p>We hope you wish to join our team.

They can happen anywhere you&#x27;re solving a problem with algorithms complicated enough to exhibit significant emergent phenomena.<p>This happened to me years ago when I wrote my first chess program.  I finished the very first working version.  It was really primitive and only searched to a fixed 3 or 4 ply.  The evaluation function was extremely primitive (taking only material into account) and it played horribly.  I could soundly beat it every time.  I didn&#x27;t know anything about game programming at the time, so I experimented around with whatever random ideas I could think up.  Nothing seemed to work well until I made a very small tweak with some kind of selective extensions.  Boom!  It immediately started trouncing me.<p>I think that is the &quot;it&#x27;s alive&quot; moment for game programmers.  It&#x27;s a magical moment to realize that your creation has exceeded your abilities...&quot;outgrown you&quot; as it were.  No, it&#x27;s nowhere near the significance of the &quot;it&#x27;s alive&quot; moments that modern AI experts might experience, but I think it&#x27;s the same feeling.",1415379664

You can spend it doing hard things and, if you die, know that you were able to go further and faster and better than all the people around you, that you&#x27;ve won, or you can die knowing that you did the same boring things people did since they were barely past apes.<p>Yes, life is truly, very short. And in both cases, when all the people who knew you themselves die, you&#x27;ll be completely forgotten. So you can spend life being happy or you can spend it being miserable. And when you die, it won&#x27;t matter either way.<p>You don&#x27;t get to say &quot;haha, I won&quot;. There is no past tense to death. You&#x27;re going to die and you&#x27;re going to cease to be. That&#x27;s it.<p>And nobody will thank you for the things you do. Even if--in the exceedingly rare case somewhere did--you won&#x27;t know it.<p>And who knows, maybe you&#x27;re all a figment of my imagination and the universe itself ceases to exist around me when I die. What then about all my achievements? What will I do with my degree and my money and my wife and my car and my house and my whatever when the universe ceases to exist?<p>NOTHING. That&#x27;s the point. Nothing.<p>You think you are so big, but you are so small. You are just as small as the rest of us. And there is nothing you can do about it.",1415379630

Planting a &quot;criminal&quot; in a cell with a defendant to elicit a confession.<p>If I&#x27;m locked in a cell with a big tough guy covered in tattoos you bet that I will make up some crazy story just as a defense mechanism. If I am being accused of murdering someone, even if I didn&#x27;t do it, I would probably tell that story just to feel safer.<p>>2.

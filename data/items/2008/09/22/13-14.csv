As usual, the end result will probably be less about law and more about the candidate involved making sure the situation turns out how she wants it to, the justice system is eager to put people in jail so I figure punishment will be likely. Everyone hates college students, lazy hippies!<p>Also, he should have probably just used TOR. I'm not really that good of a cracker, preferring to instead program useful things and then getting paid for it, so would this have covered his tracks pretty well?<p>Either way, it's pretty amazingly funny to see a /b/tard easily get access to a public figure's email and let 4chan get a hold of it, and then see the news media act like it's some sinister hacker network that did it.

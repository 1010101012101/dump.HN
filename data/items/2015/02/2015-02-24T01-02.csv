It&#x27;s called profile guided optimisation - you compile, run, take measurements, and the compiler uses those measurements to pick the right optimisations to use.<p>I don&#x27;t know how desirable it would be - you&#x27;d be shifting the burden from the compiler to the network, basically.<p>In particular, you&#x27;d still have to compile it, which means that all you&#x27;re gaining is the time before JIT decides that the code&#x27;s super hot.<p>A nicer approach might be like Oracle hints - you have a small comment you place above a function that tells the JIT how you want it compiled. You test your software using an instrumented browser, and that adds the comments between you finishing and it running.<p>It kinda ups the complexity by loads, though - and I bet the benefits would be relatively small. Stuff like minifying and compressed assets has really tangible benefits, but here you have something that can easily be done wrong, and really only improves the execution of a very small overall percentage of functions.",1424743179

My point was that a software architect could design a complete solution without writing any code, and be very confident that it will work as required when implemented. In many organisations waterfall is too expensive/slow, and often an early iteration is more important than a robust implementation. But the waterfall methodology is still the only option for mission-critical applications. And these systems are best designed by experienced software architects before any code gets written.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the architect&#x27;s involvement should end after design. They are critical to communicating the design to anyone involved with the implementation phase.",1424743098

9098265,comment,9096253,9098147,0,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"> <i>These days, when I browse the Lego section at any large toy store, all I see are heavily customized (&quot;licensed&quot;) sets that seriously restrict what you can build with them. The bow of a ship is no longer a jagged stack of rectangular blocks; it&#x27;s a large, smooth, custom-molded piece that can&#x27;t easily fit in anything but a ship.</i><p>This is another example of the rose-colored nostalgia the article mentions, I think. Lego ships have <i>always</i> used dedicated boat parts for the hulls, starting in 1973 with the Tugboat (<a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/310_Tugboat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/310_Tugboat</a>) that kicked off the Legoland Boats line; the Pirates line that debuted in 1989 did the same, starting with the Black Seas Barracuda set (<a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/6285_Black_Seas_Barracuda"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/6285_Black_Seas_Barracuda</a>). It makes them much more seaworthy for bathtub play. The Legoland Boat sets used to come with a special weighted keel piece for the bottom to keep ships upright in the water; I don&#x27;t know if the pirate ships do, but of course you can always re-use the ones from the boat sets.<p>> <i>So maybe that&#x27;s part of the reason why we think Lego is getting more expensive. There have always been small, cheap sets and large, expensive sets. But unlike in the 80&#x27;s, most of the small sets are no longer worth buying. They are so heavily themed and custom molded that the average kid can&#x27;t do anything truly creative with them.</i><p>This is definitely not true. I don&#x27;t have the money for big shopping these days, but every time I&#x27;m at a Target I like to pick up a little $5-$10 kit, ideally one of the mini vehicles. I always get hours of fun building and fiddling with the little things.<p>I feel like &quot;Lego sucks now&quot; has become a meme that people just repeat without ever actually testing it. They look at a few kits in the store, pick out whatever details fit their preconceptions, and sneer about it on the internet. Try it! Go down to the store and buy a Lego kit. If you don&#x27;t like the licensed jobbies, I highly recommend the Creator line; they tend towards straightforward vehicles and animals and robots and stuff, and most of them actually come with complete instructions for three different things per set. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1424742290

There are users who believe that their keys should only be on an airgapped machine or on a hardware crypto token or something. This is fine for things that need ultra-level security, but at the same time the gap between usability and ultra-security prevents adoption of even the simplest signing.<p>If instead we consider hosted mail providers to have a copy of private keys as acceptable, incremental improvement in security (but on the understanding that this is a weak mode), use of strong encryption would become more ubiquitous and the ones who need stronger security would be in a position to get it.<p>To make this work, I think that maybe we need more metadata capability though. Certificates should explain the level of security/usability trade-off the subject expects to take with the corresponding key (everyday use, ultra protected but awkward, etc). And protocols need better support for multiple keys that match a particular identity (eg. &quot;sending encrypted? Do you want to send it to the recipients everyday key, or his ultra-protected key but then may not bother to read it for a while because it&#x27;ll take him effort to get access?&quot;)<p>Of course, this also means that there is a UX problem to solve.

Now what you are trying to argue is that Americans just might prefer action films. Ok... great. Americans prefer action films.

Hypothesis confirmed! So we ask them <i>why</i> the prefer action films:<p><pre><code>    &quot;Because they are in English. All the good documentaries are in Spanish.&quot;

Basically, one considers a configuration space whose points are sets of points in physical space rather than some arbitrarily ordered points. One then immediately gets bosons and there is a principle which guides one to fermions. This works beautifully with spin as well, where the spin is associated with the physical point in space, not with the particle label as is usually done. I find it to be very elegant.<p>There is also an extension to quantum field theory in which the particle creation and annihilation operators actually represent those events with the Bohm particles. So that is not a problem either. It becomes an indeterministic theory at that point (creation is a random event while annihilation is simply when the particles collide).<p>The main conceptual question is dealing with instantaneousness of the theory. It is a merit of BM that it brings this to the forefront. One can always put in an arbitrary (hidden) foliation of space-time to deal with it, but it is a bit distasteful even if, as there are, foliations that can be derived the other existing structures.<p>One final note is that Bell was a very strong proponent of Bohmian mechanics even when Bohm had forgotten about it for a time. Bell&#x27;s formulation was based on the first order probability flow and not the quantum potential. Bell&#x27;s version works for spin while the quantum potential does not (sadly for numerical work).",1424741511

9098147,comment,9096253,9096253,0,0,kijin,,,"In the early 80s, my parents went to garage sales and bought me tons of used Lego sets. None of the sets were anywhere near complete, and most of them didn&#x27;t even come with a picture of the set they belonged to.<p>My parents just dumped everything into a large bin and gave me no instructions other than what the shape of the blocks themselves suggested. There were parts of cars, parts of airplanes, parts of castles and police stations and pirate ships.<p>So I made flying cars, pirate castles, police ships, and everything in between.<p>Later, when my parents could afford to buy me a brand-new Lego set for a special occasion, I wouldn&#x27;t even try to build what was shown on the cover. All the new blocks would go into the bin with the old ones, and I&#x27;d mash them together to build crazy things.<p>I think those Lego blocks made me become a programmer.<p>These days, when I browse the Lego section at any large toy store, all I see are heavily customized (&quot;licensed&quot;) sets that seriously restrict what you can build with them. The bow of a ship is no longer a jagged stack of rectangular blocks; it&#x27;s a large, smooth, custom-molded piece that can&#x27;t easily fit in anything but a ship. They look beautiful, like a nice iOS app, but they no longer inspire creativity like they used to. Instead of Minecraft, you get FarmVille.<p>I could still build a pirate-themed spaceport with that set, of course, if I had a lot of rectangular pieces. But most sets don&#x27;t contain a lot of versatile, rectanguler pieces anymore. You need to buy a very large set for that.<p>So maybe that&#x27;s part of the reason why we think Lego is getting more expensive. There have always been small, cheap sets and large, expensive sets. But unlike in the 80&#x27;s, most of the small sets are no longer worth buying. They are so heavily themed and custom molded that the average kid can&#x27;t do anything truly creative with them. Serious players are therefore forced to buy large, expensive sets. Because if you buy a 1000-piece pirate ship, maybe half of those pieces will still be useful when you later decide to build a nuclear missile silo.<p>Some time ago, I heard that you could just order a bag of generic blocks from Lego. I wonder if this is true, because if and when I have kids, I&#x27;d like to buy them that.

I believe, and I&#x27;m not alone, that the 0.08 limit is unnecessarily and arbitrarily low, and has more to do with neo-temperance hysteria than sound judgment.<p>There is a central divide in alcohol use and an individual&#x27;s response to it. Barring young people inexperienced with alcohol (and lacking a fully developed frontal lobe), most people drink a bit, feel tipsy, and then decide that they need to sober up. They&#x27;re self-aware, responsible, and careful. That&#x27;s their response to alcohol.<p>But another segment of people have a completely different response to alcohol. They have a couple of drinks, feel a sense of euphoria, and want to drink and drink and drink some more. These people are alcoholics. They may be very high-functioning — able to hold down a job and all — but they respond both physically and psychologically in a fundamentally different way.<p>The first group might get behind the wheel, if they judge that they feel alright, and drive home as carefully as they can. The second group — now drunk — will get behind the wheel and drive recklessly, exceeding the speed limit, blasting the radio, taking turns too fast and so forth. The first group might be at BAC 0.05 or 0.08, or even at 0.10, but taking all due precautions. It&#x27;s not ideal, but it&#x27;s a far cry from the second group, now at 0.15 or 0.2 or 0.3 (which takes some practice as you know, since unpracticed drunks would be passed out at this BAC), who are now whipping down the road. The first group occasionally has &quot;too much to drink.&quot; The second group is blasted every Friday and Saturday night, and sometimes every happy hour.<p>It&#x27;s this second group that is causing the lion&#x27;s share of the tragedies we see on the roadways. The shame of it is that our whole culture has to suffer because of this. A person who is no real threat to his fellows and who may very well be guilty of no other infraction at the time can have his life ruined by over-zealous prosecution.<p>I think we would do well to reconsider the problem and what we&#x27;re tying to solve, rather than simply getting MAD(D) about such things and patting ourselves on the back for making things &quot;tougher,&quot; year after year.",1424740051

  - Testing for any vitamin/mineral deficiencies that may be causing tiredness that&#x27;s displaying as an inability to focus, like low iron or b-vitamins (just examples, go see your doctor)
</code></pre>
More longer-term solutions:<p><pre><code>  - Read &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; and re-read it until you internalize it

  - Use an app like OmniFocus to organize to-dos and give yourself a sense of achievement/little adrenaline rush when you complete something (especially small things, like make bed, read 25 pages of book, one homework assignment, etc)

  - Change your study habits: turn off your phone and put it in the drawer, disconnect from the Internet if possible, relocate to a different location where there are fewer distractions (coffee shop, library, etc), give yourself small blocks of time to study (after all, work expands to fit the time allocated)
</code></pre>
Longest-term solution:<p><pre><code>  - Gain enough life experience, self-awareness, and fear of failing out of school that you eventually figure out what works for you.

Hope that helps!",1424739949

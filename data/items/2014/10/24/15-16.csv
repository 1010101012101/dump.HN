Now, something like a self-driving car could certainly turn into a self-driving unmanned combat vehicle, but I bet the Google X people would be pretty horrified if that&#x27;s what it was used for, as they are trying to save lives, not take more.<p>Someone else asked if Google is different than Lockheed Martin or Boeing, and I&#x27;d say, the answer is yes. Those companies are steeped in the defense contractor business and make a huge chunk of money by selling weapons to the military.<p>People often accuse Google of being an &quot;advertising company&quot; and look at where we get our money to find our motivations. Well, if you consistently apply that logic, our interests would be in getting you to watch more cat videos, and Boeing/Lockheed&#x27;s interests would be in the world needing more weapons.<p>You can&#x27;t simultaneously accuse Google of being &quot;only an ad company&quot;, while at the same time accusing it of being interested in the military industrial complex, where it receives almost no benefit or revenue.",1414166281

Anyways, I&#x27;ve always wondered when these places will get so cheap, and so readily available that a single, long term interest, entity will buy a large portion of a major city. At some point, even with the tenants, tear downs, clean up, and taxes, land with that amount of infrastructure around it has to bottom out right? Back of the napkin stuff and some assumptions:<p>6000 parcels (so assuming separate pieces of land)<p>average of .25 acres a piece (sourced from no where except where the dots lie on the maps in relation to sizes I&#x27;m used to seeing and accounting for some larger properties)<p>Gives you 1500 acres, or ~2.3 sq miles. That&#x27;s in a city that&#x27;s total 138 sq miles.<p>Again, assuming the article figures are accurate it will cost ~27M total to buy and deal with those 6,000 properties. So for 27M dollars you can own about 1.7% of the entirety of a major metropolitan city. That&#x27;s 1500 acres. It&#x27;s not the most desirable, it&#x27;s surely a pain, you may be able to recoup some cost on some properties or by selling scraps, it may cost $50M in total, who knows. I just think it&#x27;s interesting you can by one very large house on the coast, or 1500 acres in a still major, and formerly powerhouse, city.",1414166023

8504159,comment,8493619,8493619,0,0,checken,,,"After using Inbox for a day, here&#x27;s my initial thoughts: Incredible mobile experience, but not as productive as Gmail on the browser side. If you&#x27;re an inbox zero fan, you&#x27;ll love it. I think the point of Inbox is to bring inbox zero to the masses. They&#x27;ve replaced the &quot;archive&quot; button with a check mark button labeled as &quot;done&quot;. This button has the exact same functionality as archiving a message in Gmail, but to someone using Inbox for the first time, it would more natural to click &quot;done&quot; rather than archive. The reminders & pins are a nice touch as well.<p>The snooze functionality takes a page from Baydin&#x27;s boomerang service. However, this is where I&#x27;m still not sold. I&#x27;ve used Baydin&#x27;s boomerang service for nearly 2 years now. I use it on approximately 80% of the messages I send. Inbox gives you the ability to &quot;snooze&quot; messages, but not &quot;boomerang&quot;. I think it&#x27;s much more important to be able to bring an email back to your inbox when someone hasn&#x27;t replied to it as opposed to snoozing a message to take care of at a later date/time. I&#x27;ve come to the point of not understanding why you would even attempt inbox zero without boomerang. It blows my mind that email has been around for this long and we&#x27;re still relying on a third party app to achieve this functionality. For anyone unfamiliar, Boomerang allows you to set a message to come back to your inbox if a person does not reply to it in 12 hours, 2 days, 4 days, or any later date you choose. I started using it for business, but then I realized how much it helps with everything. I use it on most personal emails now as well. Let me give you a real world example: 3 people on an email chain, everyone agrees we need to meet one day next week. The last email of the chain someone suggests, &quot;Are you guys available next Wednesday at 10:00 AM?&quot;. In a world of inbox-zero without boomerang, this message may go unanswered if everyone on the chain forgets to reply (very common in my world). For a boomerang user, I set the email to come back to my inbox &quot;if no response&quot; in 2 days. This way, if there&#x27;s no response, I can send a follow up, &quot;So are we meeting next Wednesday or not?&quot; I still can&#x27;t figure out why this hasn&#x27;t been built in to more email services by now.<p>Anyways, coming back to Inbox. It&#x27;s beautiful, cool, great on mobile, but I will not be able to use it as my main email client unless they allow 3rd party apps like boomerang. Or, for the love of technology, build their own functionality that brings no-response emails back to the inbox! Am I the only one?!",1414164903

When you start an instance of the Erlang VM it spawns as many threads as you have CPUs and a thread for an event loop. Each thread can have thousands of Erlang processes (Erlang&#x27;s unit of concurrency is called a process) executing. Inside of the thread is an Erlang scheduler that allocates execution time to each Erlang process using a technique known as reduction counting.<p>Erlang also has great features for distribution. Communicating with processes that live in another Erlang VM node is also transparent.

First off, your two years of high school German, like my two years of high school Spanish, were likely a waste of time.  I had the highest grade in class and couldn&#x27;t speak a word of Spanish, although I could write simple sentences in present tense quite successfully.<p>I moved to a French speaking country when I was 23.  Initially, like most Americans, I thought that learning languages was hard so why bother.  After one year abroad I basically spoke 0 words of French.  Once I decided to stay long-term I took a French class, it was once a week for two hours for about 7 months.  I was teaching physics in French a few months later.  Granted I wasn&#x27;t fluent, but it was good enough and my students were incredibly patient.  By the time my own French course started up again it was unnecessary, I was learning more than enough during the day so I quit.<p>The key part was that the French class was only in French from day one.  You could not ask a question in any language other than French because the teacher couldn&#x27;t understand you (in reality she simply feigned incomprehension).  Amazingly, a good teacher can make you understand a language you don&#x27;t speak by speaking to you in that language.  For the life of me I don&#x27;t understand why high schools in the US don&#x27;t adopt this system.<p>Babies are great at learning languages and you have a massive advantage over them, you have the power of reason.  You also have the massive disadvantage of people refusing to speak to you like a 2-year-old.<p>My advice, if you really want to learn German, is to spend the next 6 months speaking to someone in German for an hour everyday (there are some websites that let you do this remotely).  Same time investment as before, but I&#x27;m guessing you didn&#x27;t spend so much time last year actually speaking with someone.  Babies don&#x27;t learn to speak through books, they listen for a year and then start saying extremely simple things.  Learning to read in German will do wonders for your vocabulary, but it won&#x27;t allow you to have a conversation.  As someone who is quite anti-social, I find this unfortunate, but the wiring required to speak another language gets put in much faster by speaking said language.<p>Also, don&#x27;t bother learning how to speak in present tense, learn how to speak in the past and future.  You want to be able to say what you did yesterday and what you are doing tomorrow.  People ask you how your weekend was and what are you doing for vacation, they know what you are doing right now because you&#x27;re talking to them.  Surprisingly, I can&#x27;t think of a language where it is harder to speak in the past or the future than in the present due to verb conjugations becoming largely trivial.<p>I want to emphasize that I was not an especially gifted student in my French class.  We were all total beginners and by the end of the course most people were functionally speaking French.",1414164886

If you break this isn&#x27;t smaller single purpose modules, you leave people the <i>option</i> of choosing your special syntax or choosing to build upon most of your work to make something that doesn&#x27;t break all your existing tooling. Clojurescript and PureScript are example of a compile-to-javascript languages that needed another format. In the case of clojurescript, only another syntax will afford you the power of S-expressions. My objection with AtScript is that the new syntax could have been a completely optional interface for getting the benefits of the tooling actually doing the heavy lifting in this module.<p>> in any case preprocessing comment annotations in what is otherwise JS to generate additional JS code for runtime type checking is creating a new compile-to-JS language, its just putting the code for that new language in something that looks like JS comments, so it would still be doing exactly the thing you say shouldn&#x27;t be done (or, in other words, your suggested alternative suggests that we must really need another compile to JS language to do this, since your alternative still creates such a language.)<p>Not exactly. Using comments allows my code to remain as vanilla JavaScript and therefore continues to work with all other off the shelf tooling out there. Asking me to adopt an entire new code format for what could have worked just fine as an extension of the standard format out there (i.e. vanilla javascript) is onerous and unnecessary. Requiring a new format requires me to through out my linters (eslint, jshint, jscs) and my parsers (esprima, acorn) and any tooling built on those parsers (ternjs, node-falafel, escodegen, browserify, sourcegraph, source maps tooling)",1414164218

I was obese at the start and decided to get back to my college-age weight. I have now lost 70 pounds using &quot;calories in / calories out&quot; as the sole consideration.<p>The challenge, as this blog post states, is knowing what calin and calout actually <i>are</i>.<p>I have often wondered: how do healthy weight people seemingly know how much they should eat to maintain weight? Many people can maintain a weight without meticulous logging and data collection.

Some people seem to have much better <i>intuition</i> about this and need no training. Others, like myself, may live most of our lives without such intuition. Only through extensive data collection, observation, and analysis have I learned to approximate how much &quot;calin&quot; a meal will result in.<p>I wonder: is there a way to <i>teach</i> this ability to children?

It&#x27;s that our governments are setup in a way that ineffectually compromises balance with shortsighted popular political stunts & corruption via dealings in secrecy.<p>I know this is a major tangent but if we want government to represent us, we have to change it in simple ways.<p>- Force living standards of the middle class onto them. No special treatment like elevated healthcare and huge pensions. They&#x27;re not kings, the world won&#x27;t end if they die a shitty death like the rest of us.<p>- Tie their wages to the average middle class citizen. That way they&#x27;re rewarded for improving the living standard of most of the country.<p>- Retirement after office. No chance for lobbying. No bribing them with cushy jobs+bonuses after their term of exploitation.<p>- Creating a voting system that actually works. Stop this popularity contest BS and genuine altruistic leaders.<p>- Mandatory factual education per-requisite for voting for specific areas of expertise. No one should be able to vote until they meet a threshold of competency and comprehension of the candidates. These tests should be by a unbiased third party non-profit.<p>- Make the lives of representatives activities completely public, in real-time. It was their choice to represent hundreds of millions of people. They need to sacrifice their freedom for our own.<p>Bet this would fix a lot given most of these issues we&#x27;re getting ourselves into are human problems rather than ideological problems. I would also like to see basic income be tried on a large scale for once, that&#x27;d be interesting.",1398938357

CSS was primarily intended as a specification for <i>styling documents</i>, and not for implementing application layout - I would wager that most of the objections actually focus around it&#x27;s unsuitability for this role.<p>That said, it&#x27;s obvious that CSS is not currently optimal for the use cases that emerged. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve had so much work on new versions, which attempt to solve some of the long-standing objections. From my perspective as a developer, it&#x27;s working relatively well; even minor changes in the general availability of things like border-box sizing have made a huge difference to the ease of doing application layout in CSS, and the situation only continues to get better.",1398937994

The mathematical approach we have here is inherently fair because percentages have the concept of &quot;fairness&quot; encoded within them; all incomes will treated equally.[0]<p>However, when talking about tax reform &quot;fair&quot; tends to be used to mean the opposite - taxing larger incomes more severely[1]. Sure there&#x27;s a problem there, but it&#x27;s not being marketed honestly: using separate scales compounds the effect of the usual more scientific scaling. I&#x27;m not saying that this isn&#x27;t sensible - but it&#x27;s certainly not the same as fairness.<p>[0] Fair is just a word. I&#x27;m not talking about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax</a> but the concept is similar I suppose<p>[1] For example: <a href=""http://www.bnn.ca/News/2014/04/30/Canadas-wealthy-take-bigger-slice-of-income-pie-OECD.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bnn.ca/News/2014/04/30/Canadas-wealthy-take-bigge...</a>   \n‚ÄúTherefore, it is all the more important to ensure that top earners contribute their fair share of taxes‚Äù is fine in principle, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that to &quot;increase effective taxation paid by top income recipients&quot; makes it more &quot;fair&quot;.",1398937951

7678963,comment,7678178,7678178,4,0,brianpgordon,,,"> One very key architectural decision for a system is the degree of reliability that it should possess. This is an explicit trade-off between the rapidity of development (in particular the level of indoctrination needed before new contributors are able to augment the feature set) and the operational stability. By preserving state explicitly to memory backed files, several classes of unexpected events causing the program to crash can be recovered from with minimal disruption. The benefit here is that the system can be developed rapidly with code reviews focusing on data integrity and paying less attention to complex interactions that can lead to crashes.<p>The mmapped files are going to break every time you make the smallest change to your data structures. This strikes me as not terribly useful for rapid development.",1398937921

Aaron downloaded JSTOR documents (bulk\nscrape) over the wireless network, and was blocked \nby the sysadmins (rate ban).<p>So he spoofed his MAC address, and the cat and mouse game continued.  When wireless was throttled (and the ban/spoof game reduced the rate of download to something too slow),\nAaron then accessed a data closet and plugged a cable into a switch, leaving his notebook in the switch room with\na USB drive.<p>The admins traced the JSTOR downloads to the switch port,\nand installed a video camera to see who was accessing\ntheir switch.<p>Aaron would access the closet to retrieve his USB drive full of downloaded files, saw the camera, and on \nreturn visits he hid his face with a bike helmet.  (He could see through the air slats on the helmet.)<p>These facts, called &quot;atmospherics&quot; by some, really\nchanged my mind about the case.  Prosecutors call\nthis &quot;intent&quot; to gain unauthorized access to a network \n(the cisco switch and data closet, after repeated \nattempts to ban access).<p>I&#x27;ve also heard the prosecution was aggressive, and \nread this everywhere, mostly focusing on Ortiz as a\nperson and her judgement (which worries me, since \nI don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;d use the same &#x27;aggressive&#x27; \nadjective for a male prosecutor).

A few events evading\na ban?  Ok fine.  Account jigger and email or \nin-person discussion to get them to stop.  \nAccessing a data closet to keep it up, and installing a cable to my switch, and installing gear?\nAnd then wearing a mask to get the hard drives?  Wow.\nIn my mind, all I can think of is: &quot;he knows it&#x27;s wrong&quot;.<p>So I think Aaron should have answered for this.  \nWhat degree of prosecution would be non-&quot;aggressive&quot;?  \n(And isn&#x27;t the whole thing like an auction where the state\nstarts high and pleas down?)<p>I think Aaron really just lost perspective (about\naccess.  Suicide is a whole other thing).<p>It&#x27;s very sad, how it ended in Aaron&#x27;s death, but for me,\nI just can&#x27;t put that blood on Ortiz.",1398937696

The &quot;tamper&quot; part of use-tamper-use in Evil Maid refers to the entire system, whereas you insist on tampering with only the ciphertext.<p>I&#x27;m still skeptical about code modification. The access the attacker gets is not really an oracle as in your byte-at-a-time scenario (I take it you&#x27;re referring to the one from your crypto challenges), they can only observe the decryption output in a very indirect fashion. The number of potentially useful &quot;needle&quot; configurations is also hard to tell, you&#x27;d need to get alignment right and produce valid opcodes throughout the block etc. And also how many tries would the attacker get in reality? The executable would need to be reloaded for each one of his tries.<p>But more fundamentally, I find the whole scenario unlikely. To get there in the first place would require the user to sync their system partition with Dropbox. I think it&#x27;s fair to say that will almost never happen.

5086421,comment,5086013,5086013,4,0,mimog,,,"Is any actual software developer even considering entering? I mean a developer that has a full time day job developing software. I do sw development by day, so by night any sw project would have to be very very interesting for me to consider participating. Otherwise I would rather spend time on my own sw projects or interests. The soup hackathon is just a 'Please use our api for something since we can't think of any useful thing ourselves' so I doubt it would peak the interest of anyone who gets a salary doing sw develoment. So who is left? Well as far as I can see, the unemployed sw developer looking for a job and trying to spruse up his resume and make some money, and the independent freelance/self employed developer who pushes out an endless supply of small apps anyway. For those developers such a hackathon is just another opportunity and better than nothing I guess, even though you are most likely just working for free.",1358672302

Countless people (including children) have died of work related injuries in capitalist societies throughout history.<p>When a slave dies well working, the master is disappointed that he just lost a valuable piece of property. On the other hand, a capitalist boss doesn't give a fuck if one of his workers dies, he can just pay someone else to do the job for the same price.<p>In 1833, the city of Lancashire reported deaths of a total of 401 workers under the age of 11 and 2,292 child laborers between the ages of 11 and 16. Factories were hot, crowded, and distracting with no safety regulations or protective equipment and child workers would frequently get caught and die in machines. The capitalist bosses didn't give a fuck that children were dying in their machines, children are replaceable.<p>This was the reality in the 19th century, before there were any safety laws whatsoever, and when Marx was analyzing these things. There wasn't any sort of socialism in North Korea, Cuba, or China when Marx was alive so they cannot be used to criticize his original ideas.",1358671737

It certainly seems so, specially since danenania isn't actually arguing for piracy, just that (s)he considers the steps of eliminating piracy to go against more important values.<p>As an analogy, the fact that I defend almost absolute free speech doesn't mean I'm in favor of all speech, it just means that eliminating said speech is worse than allowing it to exist freely.",1358671623

I'd have read that essay and thought, wow, OK, this does look like an attempt to get a lot of free engineering work and publicity. Then I'd either ignore it and hope it blows away if I had no authority, or if I did, talk to the other executives and point out that the particular issue of not paying travel and accommodations to New York is really not fair at all to the individual hackers and designers (since this is open to individuals and not design firms with a sales team and funding). I'd then publicly thank him for his insightful feedback, insist it was simply overlooked, and announce that OF COURSE Campbells is going to be paying airfare and accommodations to the 30 people that are selected to give presentations, and a family member if they like.<p>What I would definitely NOT do is pull out my rolodex and ""contact every colleague I have client-side and agency-side"" (this must be hundreds if not thousands of people) to inform them that a very mean and awful hacker has found my hackathon has some flaws with it in that I'm not paying people for the expenses necessary to comply with my demands, and so will they join in my pile on against him, the stupid annoying hacker, and his filthy company that has DARED, DARED I say to criticize the Almighty Campbells Soup company, which has been around need I remind him longer than he has even been alive the little piss ant!<p>Because that would be a really very stupid thing to do instead of just offer to pay the accommodations and airfare for these people who are doing free work for my company, and come out all roses having mastered such a minor PR challenge which has such an obvious solution to it.<p>It's not like Campbells isn't a Fortune 500 company (it is) who drops tens of millions on a Chunky Super Bowl XLVI Sweepstakes without blinking an eye at the cost. Their advertising and software development costs should not be subsidized by hackers. Given that most hackers are under IP contracts that prohibit them from entering something like this in their free time, most of the people legally able to enter are going to be hackers going through a spell of unemployment. Expecting them to do extensive free design work and fly out to meet clients for something that isn't even going to be all that much pay in the end if they do win the contract isn't a reasonable expectation. I expect though that a fair number of people will enter despite this. They might get better quality material though if they are at least willing to pay actual expenses of the finalists.",1358671564

Having to pay your own airfare to New York to do a presentation, and then 30 teams building solutions, 29 that would not be paid for. That certainly is a good deal for Campbell, and it sounds like whatever solution they buy for the $25,000 prototype plus $25,000 on completion of the full system with all the changes they request would have cost them a lot more had they hired a design firm to attempt something of this nature, especially in that they get to keep the best of 30 working designs.<p>Despite all this, much more fascinating than Jamie's post was the following exchange between Campell's brand marketer Sam Niburg and Campell's Global Head of Digital Adam Kmiec.<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/adamkmiec/status/292833747701731328"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/adamkmiec/status/292833747701731328</a><p>Regarding Mr Smyth, Kmiec says ""Don't sweat it.

When I was growing up in the 1970's I have memories that people claimed that the Saturn V, then the Space Shuttle and in the 1990's the International Space station were variously the most complex artifacts of our civilization.<p>I have been asked to do some talks about the development of technology and want to be systematic and rational, and most importantly not to look like a blow hard who knows nothing and is making stuff up! So, I would like to be able to ascribe a measure of complexity to devices in history. I have tried calculating the number of combinations that each device can be configured into, but this yields huge numbers (as combinations explode..) so huge that I simply don't think they mean much (ie. it can be said that the possible number of connections of the neurons in the brain is larger than the number of atoms in the universe, I cannot grasp the idea of the number of atoms in the universe, perhaps I am dumb, but I just can't picture it).<p>So - any ideas for a rational measure of device complexity that doesn't produce numbers like 10^67?",1358669078

The chanting (particularly the early morning chanting that begins around 5:30 AM), my limited but somewhat viable understanding of Pali, and the effort I make in meditation often line up in a beautiful synchronicity.  I am convinced that the meaning behind the Pali chanting and the experience I have of Dhamma on a moment-to-moment basis in meditation are connected, inherently.<p>Additionally, most of the old students I observe during the course meditate straight through the evening discourses.  They are not treated as breaks.  Noticing this, I took to meditating through the evening discourses myself and found that the meaning of Goenka's lectures increases dramatically, especially at the end when he concludes ardently wishing that others may find real joy, real happiness, real peace.<p>Not once in the course does Goenka exhort the mediators to unquestioningly believe in reincarnation or the vibratory nature of the body.  On the contrary, he, like Gotama the Buddha, encourage one not to take anything on faith but instead to find your own answers.<p>There's no manipulation going on during any of the recorded information played at the course.  You are only asked to follow the time table, the precepts and hopefully to ""work seriously"".<p>I am sorry you had to leave the course early and that you had a sour experience.

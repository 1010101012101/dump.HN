(the exception is &quot;PSC&quot;, that is a socialist christian party, they tend to ignore the president wishes a lot, still it is 13 deputies out of 79 in that bloc)<p>Second biggest, is indeed right-leaning, but their policies resemble US democratic party of the 90s, instead of true conservatism.<p>Third bloc is dominated by a party with no political leanings to left, or right (they only do whatever it takes to stay in power, and have left and right politicians in their ranks). The vice-president is of that party, and they are in &quot;opposition&quot; only because they want the vice-president to take over.<p>Fourth is PT, with 59 seats, it is the president party, and is named &quot;workers party&quot; and has many outright communist people in it.<p>Next 3 groups are socialist, then there is the democrats party, that has policies like US democrats, then the rest of the parties are mostly socialist too.<p>In total there are from 512 lawmakers, 108 are &quot;conservative&quot;.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve been following the votes on the Uber ban on Brazil, almost in all cases left wing parties that voted to ban Uber (and some even proposed to not only ban Uber, but make a law that make apps that call regular taxis to send lots of personal information to the governmens, including full GPS-tracked route of the person while inside the cab).<p>Meanwhile the big bloc that is &quot;conservative&quot; (the one that on my list is on the second biggest bloc in the congress) is the one that regularly vote against laws that restrict freedoms.<p>Still, our congress is awful, and is indeed proposing (and sometimes passing) lots and lots of bullshit laws.",1450324701

10749400,comment,10749129,10749129,0,0,necessity,,,"From someone living in Brazil, this article is a clickbait full of misinformation.<p>First off, we are nowhere near &quot;shutting down social web&quot;. WhatsApp was shutdown by a court order because they did not comply with a subpoena to hand over information from a user in July and August. I recently submitted a link with a local (Brazilian) newspaper explaining the issue.<p>>If Brazil’s conservative Congress gets its way, they’re going to take down the entire social web as we know it, with bills circulating through the legislature to criminalize posting social media content and to allow the government to spy on its citizens.<p>Conservatives are not the only ones trying to censor the internet in here, absolutely every politician wants it.<p>>It’s an about-face from last year, when President Dilma Rousseff approved Marco Civil, a groundbreaking Internet “Bill of Rights”, as a response to the Snowden revelations that the NSA was spying on Brazil. The landmark bill, Brazil’s first internet legislation, protects net neutrality, user privacy and freedom of speech.<p>On the contrary! Marco Civil threatens user privacy (more below), and the &quot;net neutrality&quot; part has lead to just the same that happened today: Mobile companies were forced to shutdown their &quot;free WhatsApp and Facebook&quot; plans, making millions get blocked from WhatsApp[4]. Anyway, back to the privacy issues, article 11 of the text[1] is the more worrying one. Some highlights:<p>§ 2º A autoridade policial ou administrativa poderá requerer cautelarmente que  \nos registros de conexão sejam guardados por prazo  superior ao previsto no      \ncaput.                                                                                                                                                         \n§ 4º O provedor responsável pela guarda dos registros deverá manter sigilo em   \nrelação ao requerimento previsto no § 2º<p>It says basically that police can require records of visited CONTENT without a court order and the ISP is required to supply that without informing the user. Somewhere else in the text it forces ISPs to store user history for a year. If the text really wanted to protect user privacy it would say something about cryptography, which isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere in the text.<p>Article 2 says there must be a &quot;social purpose&quot; for websites and that gov. may take websites down if it feels it doesn&#x27;t serve the public interest. Brazilian govt. already has a history of censoring YouTube and Facebook videos involving politicians, judges or celebrities[5][2][3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.camara.gov.br/proposicoesWeb/prop_mostrarintegra?codteor=912989&filename=PL+2126/20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.camara.gov.br/proposicoesWeb/prop_mostrarintegra?...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://oglobo.globo.com/tecnologia/para-nao-sair-do-ar-no-brasil-facebook-remove-posts-ofensivos-10244954"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oglobo.globo.com/tecnologia/para-nao-sair-do-ar-no-br...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.conjur.com.br/2012-ago-08/google-retirar-ar-video-ofensivo-vereador-pena-multa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.conjur.com.br/2012-ago-08/google-retirar-ar-video...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://gizmodo.uol.com.br/tim-claro-twitter-gratis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.uol.com.br/tim-claro-twitter-gratis/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PYQktiGLhw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PYQktiGLhw</a>",1450324347

There was no real <i>possibility</i> for moderation, and the sheer scale of the problem (the possibility of a 10000:1 user-to-moderator ratio) made &quot;community-building&quot; impossible. Also, it was, for many people, the only place online where they <i>could</i> express themselves—for anyone who wasn&#x27;t enough of a wizard to put together HTML and a web-server, the shiny &quot;POST&quot; button on a forum somewhere was the only way to get their opinion out there.<p>The second wave of forums is being built in an environment where everyone has their own blog (or Twitter/Facebook feed), people can asymmetrically &quot;follow&quot; one-another&#x27;s blogs in numerous ways and &quot;unfollow&quot; when they lose interest, and people each use <i>many</i> small forums to engage in their interests, where frequently these blog posts are shared (this being the usual way people&#x27;s personal blogs get discovered.)<p>In this newer system, each forum is less like a &quot;place&quot;, and more like a &quot;group&quot;—a circle of friends that happen to share a common interest, but who also share values that allow them to get along even when not talking about that interest. People bounce around between many small group-forums (HN being one of those) until they find a few forums compatible with their values, and then stay active in <i>all</i> of them, fully comfortable with the idea of participating in several non-overlapping spheres that <i>could</i> be connected and mixed together, but that aren&#x27;t, for social rather than topical reasons.<p>One more interesting aspect of the newer Internet is that, when engaged in these group-forums, people naturally lean toward developing &quot;faces&quot;: different presentations of aspects of themselves, tuned to the interests and values of the group. I would never talk about e.g. my weekends spent with my girlfriend with my online D&D group, because they&#x27;re all single so it&#x27;d just annoy them. What I do on the weekend is an aspect of <i>me</i>, but it&#x27;s not an aspect of &quot;that guy that posts in that Slack team.&quot; And so on for each group-forum we engage with.<p>I can understand missing the old &quot;place culture&quot; of the Internet—the heady days where a forum was just everybody that happened to like something or be somewhere, where both heavy arguments and friendships could spring up. But I think I prefer the current culture: the one thing it&#x27;s done for me, personally, is to remove some &quot;perennial arguments&quot; from most of the places I visit. Having a community means being able to have a culture, with cultural mores like &quot;we know we don&#x27;t agree about X, and at this point more ink spilled on the subject is just wasted&quot;—and being able to teach that culture even to new members who weren&#x27;t there for the original arguments. There&#x27;s much less to roll my eyes at on the new Internet (though there <i>is</i> the whole concept of &quot;hate-blogging&quot;, where people build communities based on a shared <i>distaste</i> for something, and then sometimes things leak out of those communities and it&#x27;s quite painful.) It&#x27;s also much simpler to make &quot;real&quot; friends (as opposed to acquaintances), since joining a group-forum is less like joining a society (which tells you nothing about how likely anyone there is to like you), and more like joining a club (where, if you liked the club enough to join, this greatly increases your chances you&#x27;ll like the people <i>in</i> the club enough to become personal friends.)",1450323306

I have found many claims, but not one properly supported by an experiment, that an &quot;alkalizing diet&quot; (which often includes acids like lemon juice or apple cider vinegar in those descriptions with some hand waving) is good for you.<p>So, my question is: I am trying to understand the origin of the &quot;alkalizing diet&quot; argument, and see whether it is science, pseudo-science or myth; can you help me with that?",1450323004

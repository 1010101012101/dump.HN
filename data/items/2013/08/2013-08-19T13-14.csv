6237227,comment,6237007,6237007,5,0,danso,,,"This is one of the better essays arguing against &quot;learn to code&quot; because it actually acknowledges that there are real benefits to learning coding that don&#x27;t relate to working in an IT job, just as there are real benefits to learning to write that don&#x27;t relate to being a published author.<p>But I disagree with the notion that, as the OP states, that learning to code is futile because &quot;most who learn to code will end up learning anything that sticks.&quot;<p>One of the most common niche phone apps I&#x27;ve seen used day-to-day, among my peers, are apps used to calculate tips from a bill. Even though the math needed to do so is trivial: it&#x27;s literally a concept mastered by fourth or fifth grade. Yet these tip-calculating apps are popular. Obviously, math is not something that &quot;sticks&quot; in a practical way with most non-STEM people...yet, why do we bother spending roughly one-third of the K-12 curriculum teaching and testing it?<p>Well, from my layperson&#x27;s viewpoint, I&#x27;d argue that while many people lose the ability to <i>do</i> math, they at least understand that <i>it exists</i>. They may not be able to multiply 0.15 or even 0.20 against a whole-dollar amount in under 30 seconds, but they at least get the concept of <i>percentage of a whole</i>, and, if there are multiple diners, the concept of division and order of operations (you want to divide the bill <i>after</i> adding the tip).<p>Would they understand this without <i>any</i> education in math? I&#x27;m just a layperson but I&#x27;m guessing that such a concept could be totally foreign to someone who has <i>never</i> learned division. At the very least, if such a person were given a malicious app that incorrectly calculated the tip (on the order of 2 to 3x, in favor of the server), that person would have no idea that they were being fleeced.<p>So I think that it&#x27;s too early to give up on coding just yet...there&#x27;s a middle ground between baking out a skeleton Rails app and having <i>done</i> enough code to understand logic and computational thinking for the rest of your life.",1376920751

Defense side has brought us AES, SHA1, etc. etc. Offense side is well... the current controversy.<p>Anyway, your words are unfortunately generic, and can be applied to any federal government agency. Centralizing resources is almost always going to be either more efficient or more effective. It is important that the NSA is technically a military organization (with tons of civilian supporters). It is run by a 4-Star General, and their primary targets are military enemies. It is imperative for the NSA to be as powerful as possible from a collections standpoint.<p>The key therefore, is in the laws that restrict the NSA&#x27;s behavior. The NSA is an outstandingly useful tool to the military... run under the same executive branch that the rest of the Military is run (Department of Defense). Unlike the CIA, which competes with the DoD for budget material, the NSA is most certainly a military tool.<p>A nation&#x27;s citizens need to be comfortable with its military. Squadrons of F16s are almost never deployed against citizens, and the massive war machines (Fleets of Carriers, Napalm, etc. etc.) are similarly not to be used against one&#x27;s own citizens. The NSA is on that list of extremely powerful, but useful tools of the Military&#x27;s toolbox.",1376920428

Complex systems are full of those.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t answer the question as to why we never read articles like this. Why doesn&#x27;t anyone ask this question?<p>So I also blame the Puritan work ethic. &quot;Idle hands are the devils tools,&quot; we&#x27;re told, and work is (like Soviet Russia) both a duty and a right. Nothing offends our ultimately Puritan-rooted morality more than someone &quot;sitting around doing nothing,&quot; even if that nothing happens to be art or philosophy or caring for their children. The latter is a great illustration: look at the crap that stay-at-home parents sometimes get.<p>So I <i>do</i> believe there is an ideological basis for this. It causes us to see the perverse treadmill you describe as a <i>good thing</i> rather than as the cancerous tumor of waste that it is. It&#x27;s a tumor that makes us tremendously poorer, especially in ways that are not readily measured by money: friendship, family health, intellectual and aesthetic fulfillment, etc.<p>An analogy: it&#x27;s sort of like if we had this weird moral belief that high-crime ghettoes were a good thing. They &quot;make people into men,&quot; etc. So imagine if we let the &quot;projects&quot; pathology that evolved in many cities in the 20th century go completely unchecked because we semi-secretly liked it that way.

Which means: either reviewing acts of EU institutions (e.g. as in Kadi, which was reviewing regulations by the EC implementing a UN Security Council directive), or reviewing EU laws, or reviewing acts of member states implementing EU laws.<p>So: while the EU does have a charter of fundamental rights (the CFREU) - and is itself soon going to be a signatory to the ECHR - you can only sue the government in the CJEU for violating it <i>when they&#x27;re implementing EU law</i>.

>>In 2003, Snow and her colleagues showed that when Bt sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) were bred with their wild counterparts, transgenic offspring still required the same kind of close care as its cultivated parent but were less vulnerable to insects and produced more seeds than non-transgenic plants. Few similar studies have been conducted, says Snow, because the companies that own the rights to the technology are generally unwilling to let academic researchers perform the experiments.<<",1376920240

The tradeoff is that you&#x27;ll need to move to the middle of Colorado, buy a small plot of land, build your own house and purchase a straight edge razor.</i><p>What if you owned the home you live in, though? Lately, I&#x27;ve become a bit obsessed with this idea. The reason the &#x27;wage slave&#x27; concept exists is that most of us <i>have</i> to do the 9-to-5, or we would unsettlingly quickly find ourselves homeless - the ultimate social catastrophe. I sometimes compare this with the lifestyle I see in some &#x27;less developed&#x27; countries, where it is still customary for a family to own the house they live in. The result is that even when the breadwinner is frequently un- or underemployed, and with parts of the household staying at home exclusively without generating an income, their lives seem a lot less stressful. Even when they worry about money and basic necessities, they survive, turning down consumption to a minimum in financially challenging times. The equivalent for us, with regards to the subject at hand, would be to work 15 hours of productive, enjoyable work and still get by. Or alternatively, to work 40 hours of really interesting, challenging stuff that might not pay well or at all for a while.<p>The conclusion would seem to be to work single-mindedly on owning your home. As you said, one option is to move to Colorado and buy a barren plot in the middle of nowhere. But a more reasonable alternative might be to work your freaking ass off to pay off your property as soon as humanly possible. If you are really scrappy, you should be able to do that in around 15 years, depending on where you live and what your salary is. The problem is that people don&#x27;t want to live like that. We want to live comfortably, with the biggest car we can afford the monthly payments on, with nice vacations, consumer goods etc. etc. Well you pay for that - the price is working 9-to-5 in a job you hate.",1376920043

Yes I do write in an aggressive and negative tone it is my style and I think it is quite effective.<p>1. Yes it is, point?<p>2. One of the main points in easier words is be WELL ROUNDED and not just read CS books , is it coincidence that a lot of great programmers (not using &quot;hacker&quot; don&#x27;t want to be trendy ) are well read. Think Rich Hickey getting his ideas from Alfred Whitehead&#x27;s books (you probably haven&#x27;t read him , he&#x27;s not a programmer). Yes I have read some of Knuth&#x27;s work ( Concrete Mathematics ) and no I haven&#x27;t read the Art of Programming Languages cover to cover and seriously doubt any one has (way to dry). Nice name drop by the way.<p>3. Getting your hands dirty on your own project trumps any other way of learning even for beginners. You will learn things on multiple domains (ie project management , debugging , and even the &quot;hackers&quot; most important skill that I forgot to mention &quot;searching google&quot;) that online code schools could not even hope to replicate. Online code schools are like letting your kids watch baby Einstein to prep them for a career in physics.<p>4. Hipster hacker , really? I never said don&#x27;t use mainstream languages , in fact I say the opposite you should select languages with the Lindy Effect. By definition these are languages that have been around for a while. I would never recommend to use languages no one has ever heard of or most likely will be a flop (eg elixer). I was taking a shot at C# and Java , which are pretty worthless ( I would know I developed in both for years) and are littered with shitty coders.<p>5. My definition of a scenester is someone who jumps on the newest technology and does everything he can to be marketable , I have not shown any other these traits. I think your definition of depth varies from mine I think you are looking for articles of how I solved coding problem and wrote about (very scenester) , my intention of this blog is not to &quot;show off&quot; my coding knowledge to get a job but to think outside the box.<p>Yes great hackers are curious (see the top of the article) and yes there are hackers on many different domains other than programming. Maybe I should change the title from &quot;IDEAS on how to be a great hacker&quot; to &quot;How not to be a fraudster&quot;<p>Anyway thanks for reading and I look forward to infuriating you more in the future.",1376919778

That should be obvious. Just to take one example: The information technology (IT) revolution, which is driving the economy, that was based on decades of work in effectively the state sector  hard, costly, creative work substantially in the state sector, no consumer choice at all, there was entrepreneurial initiative but it was largely limited to getting government grants or bailouts or procurement. Except by some economists, thats underestimated but a very significant factor in corporate profit. If you cant sell something, hand it over the government. Theyll buy it.<p>> After a long period  decades in fact  of hard, creative work, the primary research and development, the results are handed over to private enterprise for commercialization and profit. Thats Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and so on. Its not quite that simple of course. But thats a core part of the picture. The system goes way back to the origins of industrial economies, but its dramatically true since WWII that this ought to be the core of the study of the productive economy.<p>Can someone comment on this?

Especially for moderns mostly descended from folks who immigrated a century or so ago, long after all that stuff happened.  And in modern culture the average poorly educated fool can barely tell the difference between Columbus and the Pilgrims.<p>My suggestion is its more likely to be stereotypical modern american rebellion.  Give them freedom of religion, they rebel by becoming hard core fundamentalists.  Give them economic opportunity and freedom and they rebel by turning themselves into cubical drones enslaved to bank loans.  Give them free libraries and schools and they rebel by embracing ignorance as a chosen lifestyle.  Give them freedom of the press from govt interference and at least some rebellious throwbacks will demand drone strikes against anyone opposed to oppressive programs.<p>Its a pretty effective stereotype.

(I was Frag_of_lag back then.)<p>Well, I was fickle, and I liked to change mine a lot, so I came up with a PHP script which chose from three random images to cycle through whenever that script was hit. So as an avatar, somebody could set that script, with their username as a query string, as the URL, and every time that person was seen on the forum theyd have a different avatar. There was a little control panel and you could upload new pictures whenever you liked, after logging into your account.<p>This was cool! I had an actual thing, that actual people could use, and they actually did! I think I probably had about 50-100 users, which isnt a huge amount, but it felt good. I even had a feature which allowed people to add more pictures if they sent me a little bit of money on PayPal. Premium features! What an app! I think only one person ever did this, and it mightve been my mum.<p>On refection, this app was ripe for abuse. I didnt protect against SQL injection and I stored the images in the database. There was every chance that simply by putting someone elses username in the querystring, and encoding something in the right way, a malicious user with a hilarious sense of humour could replace their enemys avatar(s) with lots and lots of penises.

It is restrictive in the sense that if you go out of business or stop the business you&#x27;ll have to leave the country.  Your spouse can get a work permit, but your children can&#x27;t.<p>Another route is possible if you have a business in your own country that has been operating for a few years.

So I can install or remove whatever I want, relatively easily and quickly.  Its a slight step up from the magnet mount technique.  Using the quick disconnect on the antenna I can stick a 5/8th wave 2M vertical on if I want, or a shortened 20M hamstick-alike, or whatever I want.<p>My favorite part is my neighborhood has enough RF smog to make HF operation basically impossible (even weak signal 6M sometimes), but a RF silent park parking lot is only a short drive away.  This tends to make up for the inherent disadvantages of a small mobile HF installation.<p>You don&#x27;t need to start with a $500 all weather autotuner or $700 screwdriver antenna and elaborate mounting plans... a simple $20 stick-type on a temporary magnet is good enough to see what its like, or basically &quot;free&quot; if a local will loan you some gear to see what its like (weaksignal VHF+ rovers are like that, but some HFers are like that too).<p>Also its a lot harder and more expensive to build an installation that will survive snow and thunderstorms at 85 MPH down the interstate and survive for years outside 24x365 than to park somewhere and slap a magnet mount on the roof and run the cable thru an open window... you&#x27;d never drive around like that, but you don&#x27;t have to, so .. don&#x27;t.  It also cures the ignition noise puzzle... shutting off the engine in a parking lot tends to eliminate ignition noise pretty effectively LOL.  Only operating while parked tends to eliminate the &quot;distracted driving&quot; problem too.<p>Like all things in ham radio, if motivated and knowledgeable you can do quite a bit quickly for free, or you can spend years and thousands if you want.  Both are fun.<p>I found this all very entertaining when I was living in the apartment building.<p>The other advice I have is keep everything in a big plastic bin, so you don&#x27;t forget the radio 12 volt power cable at home, or forget your logbook, or whatever else you need.  And when you come home, throw the full bin in a corner of the apartment until next time.",1376917474

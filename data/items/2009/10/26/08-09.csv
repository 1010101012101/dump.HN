It explains exactly what you guys do very quickly and it just looks great.<p>2) I'm a big fan of no-signup demos. I wanted to play with it, but not so much that I'd go through the proccess of signing up. I have no need for your service, but hey if it was zero-effort to play with it for a minute maybe I'd recommend it to someone that does.",1256547315

Usually the way it works is that someone asks me to add a feature which I had never considered before; I do so; and then I completely forget that I added said feature and revert back to thinking of my code as I originally wrote it.<p>I don't know if this is the situation here, but I think it's much easier to change code than it is to change one's mind.",1256547055

(OSX's VLC often crashes, NicePlayer can't play partial AVI files, the built-in DVD player doesn't let you skip the ads at the beginning, etc.)<p>For development, I could never use OS X.  I rarely use the mouse, and I need a package manager for installing random libraries.   I tried this on OS X and it just doesn't work as well as Debian.  Emacs also doesn't work right.<p>A unique monitor with generic Intel hardware running Linux is a great computer.  That with OS X and it's just a paperweight.  Your mileage may vary, but I have to say that my eyebrow raises itself a bit when I hear a developer say they use OS X.",1256546325

You shouldn't be ""too smart"", but that's not the same thing as being dumb. Letting go of preconceived notions to get to the root of a problem may involve ""playing dumb"", but that's still not the same thing.<p>Still, ""dumb"" sounds less chest-beating than ""humble"" (ironically enough) so if you think you're not humble enough about being humble, by all means start calling yourself dumb instead. :-)",1256545359

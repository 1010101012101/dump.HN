For a community with 10,000 households, that is a very affordable $250 per home.'</i><p>Make that $2,500. Somewhat less affordable. That's a $2,500 capital investment for electricity that's about a third of the going rate, so it'd pay for itself reasonably quickly (within 5 years, I'd guess).<p>All this said, if they're safe, easily positioned <i>and</i> cheaper than the regular power grid in base costs, surely the power companies would be interested in rolling these out to lower their own costs? You'd certainly reduce ""cost of transport"" issues that exist with the current system.<p>Like the $1/watt solar panels, I doubt we'll be seeing these real soon, no matter the promise, but I hope places like Antarctica, remote island communities, etc, get them first.",1226199546

Rails is rather tied to ActiveRecord (Merb uses DataMapper by default, but you can choose others) and Prototype (though Rails has an unofficial jQuery plugin)). Merb was designed ground up to be agnostic on database, view and JavaScript choices.<p>Merb is ""lighter"", faster in many situations, and has a different ""flavor"" generally, that you'll either love or feel indifferent to. It was designed to be thread safe almost from day one so this element is well tested, whereas Rails is only just getting into that area with Rails 2.2.<p>Disclaimer: I like to support Merb, but I'm still a Rails user generally.",1226199302

In my 4th year engineering (my Masters) I took 3/8 of my courses outside the engineering school: Accounting & Finance; Operations Research, Entrepreneurship. I am extremely glad I took Accounting & Finance and Operations Research - I would highly recommend Accounting and Finance to <i>any</i> undergraduate who thinks they may work in management at some point in their career. The Entrepreneurship was very dry, and I can't remember a single thing that I learned there.<p>The two scenarios I see as valid for doing an MBA:<p>1. A lifestyle choice (albeit a very expensive one)<p>2. To get an opening into consulting / banking if you don't already have a background in it (though there are other ways to do this too). Having worked with many MBA hires in consulting I would say the value of the MBA is putting oneself in the pond from which consulting companies fish, and much less so teaching the skills that consultants need.<p>If I was to go back to academia, it would be for a PhD for sure.",1226199153

They're pretty durable once finished, but a major problem is that when you're done you're part is stuck somewhere in a block of wood (a 8.5x11xN block in this case). The machine will hatch the negative areas for easier removal, but there is still quite a bit of post processing, and the final product is generally lacquered to prevent splitting.<p>I'm sure replicatorblog knows the current state of the art better then me, but, while this technology is cheaper than what was going on 5 to 10 years ago, its no more advanced. All of these cheap ""3D Printers"" have the same drawbacks people have been dealing with for a decade, they just cost thousands instead of hundreds of thousands, and are less accurate.<p>I feel like rapid prototyping/3d printing is going to be one of those things that is always x-years away from breaking into mainstream, where x is some constant.",1226198862

NASA is a constant source of disappointment, it's current devotion to human space exploration is something I see as highly important as it is actually advancing useful technologies. However, due to lack of funding all its other projects are at risk of getting axed more now than ever.<p>The last mission to the moon was in 1972, since then the technology for interplanetary travel hadn't advanced. There's so many complaints that there's no reason for landing humans on the Moon or Mars, and generally yes there's nothing there that a robot can't do. Except all the people stating this neglect the fact that there's billions of dollars worth of potential income tied up in what's necessary to get to Mars.<p>If humans can safely travel to Mars, then the whole prospect of space stations becomes easily accessible. Not to mention that finding a light weight radiation shield has applications all the way from portable x-ray machines for the third world to being able to efficiently build nuclear powered aircraft. Hell, nuclear ramjets have already been tested and low-weight radiation shielding could help push to a completely reusable launch vessel.",1226198278

My point is that if the team should include tech entrepreneurs it should also include dairy farmers, mom and pop stores and advertising executves - these sectors are all as large as the tech entrepreneur sector. If you plug the tech entrepreneur hole you should also plug the dairy farmer hole - given that this sector is as large as the tech upstart sector of course.<p>A team of thousands of different people from thousands of different sectors obviously isn't a viable solution. This is why at the top level you have people that understand macro economy, finance and politics. Below this you have the whole armada of different sectors that should be heard in respect to regulation, economy, etc. that relates to their industry.<p>Basically if you want tech entrepreneurs to be on the economic team advising the president you should also have dairy farmers and advertising executives.

First, I mischaracterized Ferriss' wording and have corrected my original post: He suggested showing the final price, capturing emails and phone numbers, and asking the customer to click through to a CC-collection screen... but not actually collecting CC numbers. I'm sorry for the error.<p>Second, Ferriss makes it clear that he understands that many people wouldn't find such a practice to be ethical, even though ""it is legal if the billing data isn't captured"". (That, by my reading of the FTC rules, seems to be true.)<p>Finally... I think that any tutorial on direct marketing technique would be shortchanging you if it didn't <i>suggest the possibility</i> of doing dry testing. I get the impression that it's not exactly uncommon. Indeed, the entire personal computer industry was founded by a company that launched their first product -- the Altair 8800 -- by <i>taking money from customers</i> and using that money to fund their manufacturing. That's much farther than Ferriss would have one go, although I think it might still barely be legal if I read the FTC rules correctly. (<i>Which I'm sure I don't. Ask a real lawyer.</i>)",1226196910

357992,comment,357538,357538,0,0,dpatru,,,"I didn't see the problem with the city's action until I read Amity Shlaes's ""The Forgotten Man"" (<a href=""http://www.amityshlaes.com/books.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amityshlaes.com/books.php</a>) in which she describes the federal government's fight to displace private utilities with the Tennessee Valley Authority. The government used all the means it had to win: deception, force, subsidization, taxation, regulation, and targeted prosecutions. As a result, the valuable time of good businessmen was wasted, their investors lost money, and the public got less value.<p>If some politicians or bureaucrats want to compete with a private business, if they think they can do better, they should be free to try, but they should leave their government jobs and start their own company. It is unreasonable to expect a private business, which must persuade investors to give it money and which must persuade customers to buy their services, to be able to compete with government which raises its funds by force through taxation, limits competition by force through regulation, and then can give away its product for free because it does not have to give its financers a return. Other businesses are not the only entities harmed by government competition: taxpayers are harmed as well. Taxpayers are forced to make bad investments and forced to subsidize inefficient enterprises.<p>Put yourself in the place of each of the participants in this situation. First, imagine you're the government official who's going to run the new Internet service. You probably were not your high school's valedictorian. You probably were not voted ""Most Likely to Succeed."" You probably had average-to-below-average grades, went to average-to-below-average schools, and got a average-to-below-average job with your local government. You are definitely not CEO material. Suddenly you have the opportunity to oversee a multi-million dollar construction project and manage the ensuing multi-million dollar business. Suddenly you're a big-shot. Truly America is the land of opportunity!<p>Now put yourself in the place of the competing business manager in charge of providing the city with internet service. At the very least you have some business experience and you probably had to compete with other candidates to get your job. Furthermore, you are subject to periodic performance reviews and are compared with other managers with similar responsibilities within the company. You would like to expand service and revenue in the city, but you haven't been able to convince upper management or investors that further investment is worthwhile. Now you hear that your city regulator, the person with the power to fine you or even to shut you down, is planning to compete with you using a huge cash fund obtained by selling city bonds.<p>Now imagine you're a city homeowner, concerned about being able to make ends meet, concerned as well about retirement, feeling the need to increase investment in order to secure a comfortable pension. You're approached by a eager young man who wants you to buy stock in his new Internet provider company. The man has little or no management experience, no business experience, what little work experience he does have is in government-- a monopoly not known as a beehive of industry. You say, ""No thanks, I'm not Paul Graham. I'm not comfortable risking my money on what seems to me to be a risky scheme. I'd rather invest my money in established businesses run by experienced professionals with a proven track-record, even if that means I might be missing out on some great returns."" Then you realize that the young man is not <i>asking</i> for your investment, he's from the government and he's <i>demanding</i> your investment. Would you feel like you're getting a good deal?",1226196632
357991,comment,357608,357696,0,0,iigs,,,"When the US interstate system was built many small towns lost vitality as drivers bypassed towns, stopping generally only at their endpoints. It seems to me like there is an analog here. I don't smoke or drink carbonated beverages, and I think I've only gone into a convenience store 1-2x per year for the last five years for reasons that didn't involve the pay-at-pump machines being down.<p>In my experience the US place people go to do most of the things listed in that article is Wal-Mart. They're large, well lit, have a lot of services (optical, minor medical now), have the Code Adam child safety stuff, and they're ruthlessly efficient at keeping facilities clean and well maintained, something that can't always be said for Mom & Pop convenience stores. They're also one of the few places that the average American commuter is out of their vehicle, unlike the subway and surface street convenience stores in Tokyo (I've never been to small town Japan, so I can't speak to that, but I would expect that mindshare/branding would elevate them there as well).<p>This aligns well with my experience in Seattle. Evidently Wal-Mart is not welcome here, as there are very few in the Puget Sound area. This is one of the few places in the USA (AFAIK) that still has freestanding 7-elevens, and they're way more popular than I ever would have guessed coming from Texas where convenience stores are either inconsequential small shops or built into gas stations.",1226196614

Joy is something you can aim for, it comes in bursts and it's very rewarding and cheap to work towards. Happiness exists at the cost of other emotions which are essential to colour your life. Of course when I was ten I thought he was a grumpy old git but now at 30+ I'm starting to get it :)",1219398933

That's only ~48K/year ... after taking inflation into account, I was making more without a bachelors.<p>Oddly, most of my friends pursuing graduate degrees in the hard sciences aren't too worried about job prospects. From what I understand, it's  almost impossible for them to get a tenure track position at a decent university. But most do have the option of working in their field in industry or just becoming quants/traders in finance world.",1219397715

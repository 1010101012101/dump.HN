It's hard to know whether to cash out and take the tax hit assuming the portfolio loss will be higher- roll over to funds/management that offers more choices/etc.  Or one of the other myriad of options.<p>I'm a programmer, not a financier- so it's hard to find good objective advice with limited exposure to the field.

For the services that 37Signals provides, it's quite likely that this drops to just a few percent -- after all, their customers are tech-savvy enough to be using Firefox, Safari, and IE7.  And when you've got just a few percent of IE6 users, it just doesn't make good financial sense to spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with IE6's inane bugs.",1215104071

With the constant innovation in web apps and user demand for a more feature-rich experience, that's an uphill battle for a distributed system.""<p>That's backwards. In a distributed system there's competition between nodes because it's relatively easy for a user to move from one node to another. In a centralized system the competition is with separate systems, and since it's harder to move away an entrenched central system doesn't need to do much to survive.<p>Individual nodes also don't need to be as conservative about new features as massive centralized systems do.<p>There is a point where inertia sets in and new features that require widespread adoption become impossible (this is where email and IRC are now), but that takes years.",1215104063

- Valuation: acquired by CondeNast for a reported $12.8 million [3].
- Equity: An initial 8% diluted to 7%, additional 3% in the first round of funding. Justification: They were initially rejected, & YC didn't like their initial idea (hence the high 8%). A year after starting, reddit did seek additional capital (<$100,000). At that time, I'm guessing that they had a premoney valuation of $1MM, meaning their the 8% would be diluted to approximately 7%.

Such as assuming a mid 2010s era level of complication for a two way communication stream in something designed in the 80s for unidirectional listening.<p>The way GPS works is pretty much like LORAN (well, maybe more like OMEGA) but with embedded metadata.  So you&#x27;ve got 40 satellites who know exactly where they are and exactly what time it is and exactly what frequency is the center of their spread spectrum spread, and they&#x27;re more than glad to tell you all about it.  All 40 of them.  Maybe you can see a dozen of them at a time?<p>Anyway you sync up to the SS signal and that gives you a local offset for your clock and your local oscillator and you know the exact orbital position pertaining to that delta-t (aka distance) and delta-f (aka doppler velocity).  Now average together a zillion satellites and solve a least squares puzzle for the most likely location for you.  Which also feeds out an internal error correction signal for your internal osc and real time clock.<p>All the .mil signal does is squirt out a slightly more accurate encrypted signal so you need the same key all the satellites use and the key changes rather often.",1375117113

Do we have an analogy with what is currently happening? Our fellow techies have enabled a system of mass surveillance over us all - just like techies churning out proprietary code for corporations. Look how long it has taken for free and open-source software to make a comeback. Thirty years one could argue. That social ill never got a political/legislative fix. The GPL was a hack. Perhaps we need some kind of Stallman-like hack to act as a catalyst/seed to start pushing back against the erosion of privacy and internet freedom.

6122290,comment,6121501,6122116,10,0,drbawb,,,"Groupcache being a library is what made me so excited about it in the first place.<p>I&#x27;m writing a torrent tracker in Go that could make great use of a distributed cache. This would enable you to put an arbitrary number of &quot;tracker nodes&quot; behind a load-balancer.<p>One of the goals of my project is that its easy to configure: everything except the RDBMS is hosted inside a single binary and configured with a single file. In the simplest case: that binary is responsible for two web-servers, a process-local cache, and a DB connection pool. (In more complex cases, each binary simply acts as another node behind a load-balancer; and they attempt to cooperate together.)<p>It&#x27;s useful to avoid hitting the disk by having the tracker cache torrents that are active. When you start adding more tracker nodes, this is where having a distributed cache would be nice.<p>Without groupcache, that means I&#x27;ve just forced my users to install and configure memcached. With groupcache, the configuration and server are simply part of my application. (As an added bonus, since Go is statically linked, I haven&#x27;t even added any external dependencies on shared libraries.)<p>---<p>I agree that the use-cases for groupcache are far more limited in scope, but I was still glad to hear that this was a library, and not a standalone server. I think we need _more_ distributed caches implemented as libraries, not less.<p>There are many use-cases where it may not be preferable to have a separate caching server. In my career: getting approval to install memcached on a customer&#x27;s server could add _weeks_ to our deploy time simply because of red-tape; in my personal programming endeavors: setting up memcached is just an added layer of complexity that could easily be avoided by using libraries instead of servers.<p>I&#x27;d argue that we should leave memcached [more specifically: standalone distributed caches] for the more complicated scenarios where a dedicated solution is called for. Bring on the distributed-cache libraries where a much simpler, ad-hoc solution would be more beneficial to end-users.",1375117073

I much prefer the HTML convey semantics (to the dev, not to the user) than having magic happening behind the scenes with CSS.<p>By having the classes in the HTML, you know at a glance what is going to happen. Whereas using extend there&#x27;s an extra layer of indirection, you end up having to look at the HTML, see there&#x27;s a class called something like &quot;sidebar&quot;. Then you have to look at the SASS, find the sidebar class to see there&#x27;s an extend directive, then and work out what&#x27;s going on in there. That&#x27;s an extra step i&#x27;d rather avoid.<p>People usually follow this approach to get &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;semantic&quot; markup, but there&#x27;s some falsehoods in that thinking. The &quot;markup looks ugly&quot;, or is &quot;non-semantic&quot; are misguided: no user agents infer semantics from classes, and the ugliness you describe is purely aesthetic, <i>the real beauty is in the semantics the developer can infer from having clear and obvious classes in the HTML</i>. Another classic argument is it makes the markup bloated. This may be true on the surface, but when you factor in GZIP, it is completely negated as more repetition == better compression.<p>A great read on the topic is Nicholas Gallagher&#x27;s article &quot;About HTML semantics and front-end architecture&quot;[1].

The efforts to take Bootstrap to version 3 were pretty significant, at the minimum they deserve a pat on the back for that alone.<p>Here are some important concepts I think a good portion of people are missing.<p><i>Upgrading</i> - Don&#x27;t upgrade for the sake of upgrading. If you have a fully functional site right now which uses or extends a previous version of Bootstrap your incentive to upgrade at this point is probably minimal.<p>At some point you had conceded that version X of Bootstrap was the right front end framework for your project. If that has changed you need now concede you have some work ahead of you.<p>Identify and evaluate the features introduced in Bootstrap 3 that are lacking from your current project. Scope out the markup and stylesheet refactoring required for any of the &quot;must haves&quot; and setup a schedule to integrate. Realize that this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you are bringing Bootstrap 3 into your project, more so you may just be adapting your existing front end assets to model Bootstrap 3 features/patterns.<p>This is really no different than an existing site that doesn&#x27;t use Bootstrap now wanting to bring the framework into their project. If you&#x27;ve identified that you need Bootstrap 3 for your project, you would expect there is work to be put in.<p><i>Usage</i> - I see a number of comments critiquing design and usability. Is Bootstrap really intended to solve those problems for you?<p>In my opinion this is a framework intended to bootstrap your front end assets and development efforts. It prescribes conventions for common component markup and their respective selector naming conventions.<p>Think about that for a moment how valuable that is to your project (especially those with a large number of contributing developers). How many projects previous to one using Bootstrap did you have such well documented markup, style and naming conventions?<p>Bootstrap standardizes and documents front end patterns for rapid adoption and implementation into your project. That&#x27;s pretty damn special. If what they promote doesn&#x27;t align with your needs or development practices, well, don&#x27;t use it.<p><i>Style</i> - Bootstrap wasn&#x27;t designed for your site, your users or even to keep up with the latest design trends. The styling, while in the view of many is decent, seems to have been intentionally minimalistic and not overly opinionated.<p>It provides basic structure and basic styling. It&#x27;s your starting point. You can get to your destination now a bit quicker without needing to reset their style rules.<p>Having such minimalistic styles probably serves to be good motivation to get creative. If you want custom and don&#x27;t have the design ability to get there, rest assured there will be a companion stylesheets to extend bootstrap coming soon to at a market place near you.<p><i>Inspire</i> - If the Bootstrap shoe fits, wear it. If Foundation, Pure or any other front end framework fits the need, use it.<p>To me the great benefit of all these popular frameworks is they bring to light many well thought out development approaches to the front end. Not everyone will agree with them. They aren&#x27;t always bullet proof. Though at the end of they day though they invoke developers to take a look at their individual assets and recognize areas of improvement.<p>Find the framework or approach that best aligns with your needs and personal preference and customize the hell out of it.",1375115810

You&#x27;ve got two factions of symbiotic employees who have more or less differing objectives.  (Thankfully, I haven&#x27;t had to work with any Pete Campbells.)<p>A lot of this has to do with the way we incentivize/disincentivize various business roles.  At your average company, an engineer/developer&#x27;s #1 goal is &quot;don&#x27;t fuck up&quot;, meaning: take time and caution when developing and releasing things and don&#x27;t do anything that could break anything (both in the sense of &#x27;throw an error&#x27; and &#x27;cause a customer to leave&#x27;.  The latter is especially important in the enterprise space, where a single customer can be worth more than 10% of your revenues <i>and</i> act as a marketing engine through whitepapers and referrals.)<p>On the other side of things, sales folks are usually incentivized to sell, sell, sell.  They get paid to sell things, so any behavior that doesn&#x27;t maximize their ability to increase their commission is actively disadvantageous to them.  Usually, this incurs a sort of long-term blindness: by devoting three developers to feature ABC for a week and making $X, you take them away from perhaps a bigger feature that might make the company $X * 10.  Plus, by making time-sensitive promises to clients/customers you limit the engineer&#x27;s ability to not fuck up.<p>The answer to this isn&#x27;t &quot;sales people are bad and should be more honest&quot; or &quot;engineers should be better at what they do&quot;.  There are a lot of different strategies: at smaller companies, you&#x27;ll see ideals like uniting sales and marketing (&quot;marketing&quot; not in the sense of advertising, but in the sense of product development) but the biggest successes I&#x27;ve seen have revolved around shifting those incentives: commissions are simple and easy to tinker with (there&#x27;s a lot of new interesting literature about &#x27;recurring commissions&#x27; which reward salespeople for longer-lasting customers), but your average engineer at a firm deserves a better incentive to produce quality work than &quot;if you don&#x27;t you will look bad.&quot;  Sales commissions for engineers may sound weird, but I think if you remove the decades of context there&#x27;s nothing crazy about the idea that if someone creates a feature that generates $6million for their company, they&#x27;re entitled to a small slice of that $6million.",1375115602

Glide slope station for runway 09R at Hannover Airport in Germany<p>>Due to the complexity of ILS localizer and glide slope systems, there are some limitations. Localizer systems are sensitive to obstructions in the signal broadcast area like large buildings or hangars. Glide slope systems are also limited by the terrain in front of the glide slope antennas. If terrain is sloping or uneven, reflections can create an uneven glidepath causing unwanted needle deflections. Additionally, since the ILS signals are pointed in one direction by the positioning of the arrays, glide slope supports only straight-line approaches with a constant angle of descent. Installation of an ILS can be costly because of siting criteria and the complexity of the antenna system.<p>>ILS critical areas and ILS sensitive areas are established to avoid hazardous reflections that would affect the radiated signal. The location of these critical areas can prevent aircraft from using certain taxiways[3] leading to delays in takeoffs, increased hold times, and increased separation between aircraft.</i><p>You don&#x27;t think that the ILS system could be vulnerable to an attack similar to this?

This mythology of the US being a forward-thinking model of how to run a country may have been true in the 18th century (arguable), but since then the rest of the world has caught up. Today, on the world stage the United States is a nation like any other.<p>In fact, there are many nations where people are just as free, if not more, than in the US. As one example, while the myth of the &quot;American Dream&quot; is about social mobility, especially inter-generational mobility, in reality the US ranks fairly poorly by that measure. It is not enough for everyone to be <i>de jure</i> free, if their parents&#x27; race or socioeconomic status strongly determine the choices a person has available to them and their eventual success in life.<p>The US has deep social, political and economic problems, all of which impinge on an American&#x27;s practical freedoms.

The latter can work; I&#x27;ve seen a number of open source codes adapted to distributed filesystems.<p>This is made easiest if the underlying includes an IO abstraction layer.

From that, it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to write a &quot;distributed FS variant&quot; (although IO and OS are not orthogonal concepts).<p>The next problem you&#x27;re going to have is performance.  nginx and other systems really are written with the expectation that IO is local, high throughput, and low-latency.  Opening a remote file often takes some time (hundreds of milliseconds), and serial roundtrips cause additional latency, especially if DFS and server are not within 5ms RTT.<p>The next logical step is to write a readahead layer (if you&#x27;re serving files larger than a single read block to the DFS) to get better throughput.<p>A combination of the above techniques, with a bit of tuning and elbow grease, is a good foundation for scalable (in terms of file size, total # of files, etC) serving.",1375114106

You take written contributions from a much larger community, you put the contributions in a room of committee people with, quite honestly, vast political differences and all with their own political axes to grind, and four years later you get something out, usually without it ever having been implemented once.<p>So the Internet perspective is implement it, make it work well, then write it down, whereas the OSI perspective is to agree on it, write it down, circulate it a lot and now we&#x27;ll see if anyone can implement it after it&#x27;s an international standard and every vendor in the world is committed to it.

For colored images, each entry in the matrix can be a vector of (Red, Blue, Green) scales, since every color can be represented by these three basic colors.<p>Now, when you want to produce any effect, essentially you need to do some operation on this matrix. For example, if you want to remove the high contrast (sudden change of color from white to black), then you need to remove the high frequency components from your matrix. Taking a Fourier transform and removing the high frequency components and taking back the inverse transform can do the trick for you.

Data points I have are drawn from several 3DayStartup events, hackathons, daily interactions in labs, and working as a technical mentor to a few teams trying to make a startup. Some observations:<p>- The technical know-how varies <i>widely</i> among teams in undergrad, and web technologies seem to be somewhat ignored at the prestigious school: though they are slowly getting better coverage, the fact is that the curriculum is really better for more traditional computer-science topics and things related to systems and computer engineering. The commuter school offers somewhat more vocational training (MIS/CS/ITish stuff not so theoretical), so the webdev talent there seems a bit higher.<p>- The commuter school seems to have a bit more business hustle than the prestigious university. The students there seem to instantly grasp that revenue is an important thing, and have ideas which would appeal to the mass market a bit better. Conversely, for the really hard technical problems (not webdev stuff, but hard engineering and systems and math) the university students have an edge.<p>- There are way, way, way too many teams (mostly at the prestigious university) that seem preoccupied with solving problems that only apply to affluent college undergrads. Worse, many ideas are adaptations of research or design projects which are &quot;Let&#x27;s build this thing cheaply for the third world&quot;, and they lack the skill (usually) to explain why that would be a lucrative investing opportunity.<p>- At the accelerator for the prestigious university (now finishing its first summer round) some of the undergrad teams seemed to have trouble making the mental shift from &quot;this is a school project like all the other ones I&#x27;ve done before&quot; to &quot;oh god this is a real business there is no rubric to follow i need to start hustling&quot;.<p>~<p>I&#x27;d be interested in hearing what others&#x27; experiences are doing similar work.

Tools, methods, counter-measures, threat models, secure protocols, best practices,  crypto, anonymization, companies and startups engaging in such, etc etc etc. These are topics that HN&#x27;s core audience can engage with, while still being relevant to current events. Even the legal stuff (FISA and warrant compliance, legality of wiretapping, etc) is interesting, especially as it relates to our startups and the companies we deal with.<p>There is an argument to be made that surveillance/wiretapping programs require a political/legislative fix, not a technical one. But on the whole, I&#x27;d prefer that discussions involving the minutiae of such (and the events which propagated them) not be conducted here, at least not in recent quantities.",1375113606

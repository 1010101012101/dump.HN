The traditional Argentine knife sharpener rides a bicycle around town blowing a sort of multitonal whistle; when you take your knives downstairs to him, he puts down a stand that lifts his rear wheel off the ground, engages a belt with the rear wheel (which is modified to enable this), and drives his grinding wheel off the belt.  This is a substantial advantage over the medieval method of having your apprentices whip the lathe and pull the whip.<p>Really, bicycles have a lot of advantages in any kind of material shortage.  I've just been a bit down on them because of the amount of work they need.",1360673990

There is a quite a lot of boilerplate code and views composed of other views were for me hard to manage.<p>I also wrote some macros to use Backbone from Clojure but the mismatch between object/mutable and functional/immutable is too high.<p>Finally the approach from <a href=""http://clojurescriptone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojurescriptone.com/</a> seems promising. It uses a simple yet flexible event dispatcher. Add that a templating engine and you are done.<p>Debugging ClojureScript within the browser is harder than normal JavaScript but it's easy nonetheless to find what generated JS functions corresponds to your ClojureScript code. If you compile in debug mode you can set a breakpoint as usual. Compiling ClojureScript adds a bit of overhead to the workflow but I compiled it continuously in the background via Emacs and forget about it, it just popups when an error occurs.<p>In general I found ClojureScript much cleaner than JavaScript and it's easier for me to write cleaner code with  it when the data manipulation or the logic is not trivial.",1360673822

You basically cannot understand if you are on a wire connection or if your uplink is via a sat by looking at just the ping output. You can try an bounce ping off multiple servers, relay pings and gather RTT properties over any graph path that includes your node and test servers, and yet you will always come one equation short for solving the linear system you'd end up with.<p>-- However --<p>If you make an assumption about some property of some path, then - boom - you <i>can</i> find the one-way latency for any edge on the graph. For example, if you have two test servers that sit on a backbone, you can assume the path latency between them is about the same either way. This gives you an extra linear for the system and this in turn lets you calculate the one-way latency between you and either of these servers.<p>It's a pretty neat problem.

If the latencies were unconstrained, I would agree that it is impossible to solve the initial riddle.  However, since it states that there are only two possibilities, 2s:2s or 3s:1s, it sure seems solvable to me.  You have two equations and three variables, but you don't need to solve for the three variables.  You can eliminate the skew and end up with a single equation and two variables - the two latencies.  That allows you to solve for the difference between the latencies.  And since the possibilities are constrained, that is sufficient to solve the problem.<p>Of course, in a real world scenario the possible latencies would not be discrete, so indeed the problem would not be solvable.  But that's not how it was presented.  So either the puzzle was poorly constructed as an analogy for the real-world scenario, or (more likely) my sleepy brain is missing something fundamental.

(For example Apple will quote a USD price for a laptop that they will build using Yuan... even though the exchange rate between USD and Yuan is always changing).<p>In fact, your USD pizza parlor example is actually more complicated than you make it sound -- tomato prices, wheat prices, etc all fluctuate based on supply and demand.<p>I think this is a place where web entrepreneurs get confused because their high margins and large suppliers do such a good job isolating them from the problem: if web profit margins were 10% over the cost of hardware, and if you were running your own servers, you'd be exposed to the fluctuation of energy and bandwidth prices... you'd have the same problem predicting how much it would cost to serve a web request. (I imagine Google actually faces problems like these because of their scale).<p>So it's not like these problems don't happen when you use USD... it's that your margins are so high, and your providers are so good, that you've forgotten the problem existed in the first place. #firstworldproblems<p>For those curious how these sorts of problems are handled by non-web companies, the answer is derivatives. Apple will hedge their USD -> Yuan conversions as necessary with currency options, Dominos uses wheat futures, the farmers supplying wheat to dominos are using oil futures, and the oil company will have currency hedges for the 50+ countries they operate in. By buying and selling risk, companies are able to give you the feeling that prices are stable.

As regards API design, it's a matter of taste but my preference and that of many others who use python, as we can see with the popularity of requests, Flask, is that an API should be designed for simplicity for the common use cases rather than for absolute completeness.\n  I'm not saying don't expose a low-level API full of BufferedReaders, JSONParserCursors, but don't force it on me to parse a tiny JSON document of known length.",1360670444

It's all about perception.<p>Note that an important factor is that your peers have to know that the phone is prohibitively expensive. If they don't the point is lost. This is also why superyachts are so popular among the ultrarich. Everyone knows that they are crazy expensive to buy and maintain, and so they know you have the money to do so.<p>Douglas Adams has an unparalleled quote about the psychology behind it - <i>""No expense had been spared to give the impression that no expense had been spared""</i> This is also the only instance I've ever seen of recursion being used in fiction :-)",1360670420

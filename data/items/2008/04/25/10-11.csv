It does not deserve to ever be mentioned in the same sentence as evolution.  I'm fine if Ben Stein believes this individually but what offends me is his desire to spread his lies.",1209120892

It is a shame people don't take children seriously, but it is not a shame that Ben Stein is going to be blacklisted by Hollywood.<p>Ben Stein may say some valuable things in the future and I don't completely dismiss everything he says as wrong -- I just do not care what the man has to say anymore.",1209120813

I helped get a few major 90's-era dotcoms up and running and many of them are still at it today.<p>My experience is this: either you waste a <i>lot</i> of time futzing around with computers, or you make them do the work they need to do and get on with your life.  It has nothing to do with how old or young you are, or how many kids you have.  I am a very happy Father now - in fact, this is the greatest startup, with the most rewards, I've ever been involved in - and I'm still applying the same fundamental policy to myself as a programmer: get things done, don't futz around with computers, make them actually do the work they're supposed to do.<p>It doesn't matter what ""kind"" of person you are, it matters only what kind of things you make.  I know 50-year old grandfathers who can kick royal Assembler ass and still leave early at the end of the day, and I know 18 year old kids who put the keyboard down after 8 hours and go do something else instead, as well.<p>IMHO, this over-generalization about 'types of people' is a real curse.  I would say, don't do it.  There are no 'types' of people in the computer world, no matter how the ycombinator cultists want to pitch it to the world: there are people who get things done, and people who don't.<p>Get things done.  Get your code written, working, tested, and in the hands of people who will actually use it.  If you can't do this, then you will fail.  If you can, then rock on .. may your kids, now and in the future, always appreciate this aspect of you as a person.",1209118481

Personally, I until I turned 18 I was incredibly frustrated time and time again because people did not take me seriously, as they would an adult. It wasn't because of what I was saying, but because of <i>who I was</i>: a child. So while I wholeheartedly disagree with Mr. Stein's political views, I stand by the notion that a person can say powerful words regardless of who they are.",1209118418

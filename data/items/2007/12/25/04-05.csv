If newcomers step on your toes, channel regulars should have the maturity to deal with it respectfully. I'm not entirely new to Lisp, and I'm not stupid, so why not take the time to try and educate instead of discourage? I asked just that, and I got very close to, ""why waste the energy, you'll never learn."" Ten minutes in an IRC channel isn't enough time to make such a judgement. <p>The article above may be a bit blunt about it, but I think the term ""douchebaggery"" is pretty darned accurate from my experience with #lisp.",1198558606

Spend a day in #haskell, #python, or #ruby asking basic questions about the language, then repeat in #lisp.  <p>There are helpful people in the CL channel, but most newbie assistance ends with the veteran delivering a scolding.  That doesn't consistently happen in other language channels, but perhaps it should.",1198556127

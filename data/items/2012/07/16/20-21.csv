4252636,comment,4247488,4250058,4,0,pjscott,,,"Hi! Former Christian here. I don't mind the idea of proselytizing -- if you genuinely believe the stuff about salvation, then it's practically your duty to proselytize -- but your methods leave something to be desired! The main problem is, that wasn't persuasion; it was an infodump about basic Christian doctrine and eschatology, couched in vaguely Biblical language. That may sound good to you, but to people who don't already believe the same things you do, it sounds like a concentrated load of crazy. I'll give an example:<p><i>The core Christian belief is that _all_ humans are sinner (or evil) and that none of us are deserving of anything but death. But God so loved us (his creation), that he decided to save us by taking the penalty of our sin (which is death) upon himself on the cross.</i><p>That's weird! That sounds like some creepy human sacrifice cult thing. If there's some context which makes this sound reasonable, then you need to include that context if you want to avoid turning people off.  And that part about how we're all bad people and deserve to die? I would be insulted, if I thought you could actually believe something so horrible. I think you're a nicer person than you pretend to be, though! Here's a smiley face to soften the blow of my words! :-)<p>In other words: know your audience. And, I guess, try not to spring such aggressively creepy-sounding beliefs on people without some justifying build-up.",1342472367

4252618,comment,4252046,4252046,17,0,ori_b,,,"The solution is what it always was. Design in units like 'em's, don't override the user defaults, and let the page scale however the end user wants. This not only accomodates the retina/non-retina split, it lets users with bad eyesight increase the font size and still be able to read things.<p>Images? That's a bit harder, but it's not the end of the world. Vector images are useful here, but for higher detail raster images, designing in double size and scaling down for ordinary screens gets you a long way. For smaller icons, it might pay to have two versions, and I don't see a way around that for a while. Gnome has handled this for a long time by having specific sizes of icon that it tried to snap to, as well as vector fallbacks for when none of the sizes were appropriate.<p>The important thing is to give up on pixel perfection. Just let the user chose the size, and don't mess with their defaults.",1342472152

Not a chance. The content niche products like sports or finance? Nope. Web mail? Comeon. Classifieds & jobs? Nope, small potatoes. So what is it?

It was first rate. Furthermore I'm not disparaging you because it's necessarily bad to learn imperative programming first.

Please educate me.<p>Several other posters have mentioned the option of moving away from raster graphics, and indeed this was my own first thought.  I remember using IRIX back in the glory-days of SGI.  For those who have no idea what I'm blathering on about, IRIX was a professional workstation OS that had en entirely vector based UI.  Yes, almost two decades ago an OS existed that was <i>immune</i> to the retina problem.  Pause for a moment and let that sink in.<p>IRIX was actually one of the first GUI-based OS's, and SGI's use of vector-based UI elements probably arose from specific needs SGI faced.  I can only speculate on what they were, but one thing they had plenty of was raw power.  SGI workstations were <i>very</i> nice in their day!  However, the average smartphone built these days probably has more power than all but the last SGI workstations, and perhaps even them too.  Processing power is therefore likely not the issue.  In fact, given that most desktop OS's already render your desktop in a 3D environment (OSX, Win7, and Linux (depending on what you're running) all do this), vector UI elements may actually be less intensive to draw than raster elements in these situations!<p>Wild speculation:  Is it that UI building tools and API's make working with vector graphical elements painful, or are UI designers just ignorant after almost a decade without a major vector-based OS in common use?",1342470516

The products that generate the bulk of their sales are at best stagnant with no growth left, and at worst are slowly collapsing.

If the goal is to generate shareholder value, Mayer should focus on getting her hands around an engine of growth that she can really add value to; a smaller Yahoo where she can drive a few growth products (assuming those can be found first).

What if I want to encrypt using AES-128/CTR-BE and then sign using public/private key rather than using an HMAC(SHA-256). That choice can be left up to a developer. Also, there still seems to be some debate as to whether you encrypt then HMAC or if you HMAC then encrypt. (I personally prefer encrypt then HMAC).<p>I don't think you necessarily have to have the developer provide the IV, you can provide a way for the developer to get the generated IV back from the system after the fact that would work just as well. So long as you can get access to it, so you can build it to spec. All this hiding is good for projects where that is possible, interoperability and following gov't requirements can throw a wrench in simply using something like Keyczar.<p>The biggest issue with DH that we have had to overcome is the different encodings that may be used. You have various different standards for how to share the DH keys. There is an ANS X9 standard that is recommended by the government[1] (and required in our product) and then there is PKCS3.<p>The biggest issue we ran into is that Java (on Android) only does PKCS3, and Botan doesn't by default decode that so you end up having to implement that functionality yourself. We ended up using PKCS3 but that will most likely have to be changed for gov't approval which means we need to get Java to grok ANS X9.<p>When doing DH I also suggest using one of the NIST approved DH groups and not generating your own.<p>Do note that none of this is using a custom DH implementation, it is using the stuff that is available in Botan/Java itself, the biggest issue is finding common ground for finishing the DH key exchange because of the different formats used in the in-between steps.<p>Also, generating a random key from the DH data is different on various different API's. Botan can generate keys for you, and will use a KDF for you, while Java will simply give you the bytes back in raw format.<p>So far this isn't a solved problem for us. Since we are not using it for cryptographic purposes we may end up doing our own custom implementation so that we have less to worry about in terms of encoding/decoding various different storage schemes. And any weakness in the system won't be a fatal flaw that could be used/exploited in a meaningful manner, so fixing things at a later date won't be catastrophic.<p>The biggest issue is that there are so many standards and so many little variations of it in cryptography that trying to get systems to interoperate and work together is a massive undertaking and each time you run up against a wall because something is abstracted away you wish and eventually want access to the lower level primitives.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-56A/SP800-56A_Revision1_Mar08-2007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-56A/SP800-56A...</a>",1342469917

It's just a superfluous modality that gets in between the muscle memory, the goals and the training.<p>Of course, this method will get you familiar with shortcuts rather quickly (I only tried the Vim ones), but then, so does printing out a cheat sheet, or reading some tutorial and an afternoon of practice. While I do believe ShortcutFoo does manage to teach that more effectively than those methods, that's not where it could really <i>shine</i>.<p>To become a pro text-editor user, you really need to go beyond that, hence <i>muscle</i> memory, not just ""memory"". You don't merely need to remember the shortcut for ""go one word back"" when presented with the written goal ""go one word back"", no you must intuitively know the shortcut as soon as you identify the goal already on an abstract level.<p>Even with a simple default editing control like this text box: As I'm typing these words, I'm not thinking of every letter I type, I don't think about whether I need to ""move cursor left five times"" or ""move cursor left one word"" or ""delete word to the left"" etc, I'm thinking about the sentences and ideas I want to put into this post and operate the keyboard to make that happen--and any literal textual description of shortcuts and movement commands would really just get in the way with my thought process.<p>I haven't seen @gruseom's post yet, so maybe s/he had the same idea but: Something like a phantom cursor that indicates ""get the cursor to here"" or half-fade a word that you must delete? \nBut that may become too low level once you get more advanced. What you really need is a sort of visual indication that shows a diff between the original text and the goal text, you get to look at it to take it in while a quick countdown timer goes 3-2-1 and from that point it times how quickly you can edit to the target and how many keystrokes it takes you to do it.\n(could even make it a colour-coded actual diff, then people get to train reading diffs as well :) [something I need to practice myself])",1342469755

Not only will vector graphics make support of various screen densities easier it may also (significantly) decrease size of assets.

We'll be doing an official launch in the next month.<p>Our initial beta customers have been working really close with me and the rest of the team to shape the product. So, the benefits have been around automating parts of the process that are annoying and manual right now. An example: most of our customers have one centralized person (out of 10-40 in the company) that does all the scheduling, sourcing, coordinating with recruiters. We looked at her process (done in google docs) and tried to automate as much as possible. The result: you can now schedule interviews directly from our gmail widget, select a person from your org, a candidate, and a time and we book the meeting on the respective calendar, notify the interviewer about the interview, send them the resume/coverletter and evaluation form and then bug them every 24 hours after the interview to ensure the feedback is logged. The estimate was that by simplifying this process to 3-4 clicks we save her ~ 20 hours of annoying work per week.<p>The tool has been built around simplifying work flows like this. We're still hashing out all of them, but our central thesis is: 99% of recruiting time is done through the inbox so why doesn't your ATS/CRM live there with you. Over the next couple weeks we're moving the functionality from the web app into the gmail inbox, when that is done we'll officially launch.<p>Honestly, I think the main benefits of Foundry are as follows:<p>- We've studied workflows across dozens of companies from Palantir to Facebook to small companies and built the tool around optimizing workflow and collecting data.<p>- When you come to us we have an out of the box process that works well (we'll show you data) that is somewhat customizeable to your particular company's process. So you start with a good base and the tool reinforces good behavior. This is the part of the tool we're building on the most: how to convey/reinforce best practices in the hiring process.<p>- Everything is in your inbox: no context switching/learning a new system.<p>- In the early stage I work closely with all our customers and as we learn new best practices/tips we pass those on to you.<p>- Lastly, I honestly think that using something like Foundry forces you to think critically about your process (as opposed to winging it), by giving you a framework you end up with a process that works more efficiently.<p>Our hope is that once we get more data around hiring we can push that knowledge out to everyone, so that company's stop losing hires due to the problems listed above. If you have any questions about your process or want some friendly advice about what you're doing well/poorly I'd be happy to chat, email in my signature.",1342469133

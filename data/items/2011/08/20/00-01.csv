And, we use Paypal as our credit card processor.   But today I was floored to see the following after filing a standard response to a buyer complaint:<p>---<p><i>Hello [ourBusiness],</i><p><i>After careful consideration of this case, we've decided in favor of the\nbuyer.</i><p><i>PayPal has determined the buyer should receive a refund.  Due to the unique\ncircumstances of the claim, and your PayPal account history, we will refund\nthe buyer on your behalf.  Your account will not be debited.</i><p>---<p>So what does the above actually mean?  Paypal refunded the buyer and allowed us to keep the funds!  To make it clear, the complaint filed by the purchaser was absolute BS. We also make it clear during the subscription purchase process that no refunds are allowed.<p>Granted, we run a considerable amount of transactions through Paypal (probably about 500K a year) but this is the first time I've ever dealt with a Paypal dispute where Paypal has done this.  Chargebacks happen, and from what I've found you are almost powerless unless you have an ton of evidence to respond with.<p>My reason for this post is to point put that PayPal isn't always evil.  My business has been using Paypal as our credit card provider for over 9 years now, and while I've been frustrated at times (trust me, contacting them is a big problem as a vendor), and read the Paypal-horror-stories, in horror, I can honestly say that what happened today has me feeling good about PayPal as a business partner.",1313800738

We only keep this lookup entry around for a very short time (like 30 seconds) and remove it after the first time it is used.<p>It is a total hack, but it works in most cases.

Ever.<p>I believe that what the majority of users want when interacting with internet platforms like Google, Facebook, etc. is a responsible use of their data; a reasonable balance between giving up information and receiving benefits in exchange.<p>From that perspective I would argue that Facebook collecting data from you simply by 'browsing-by' a like button is unacceptable. But I wouldn't go as far as to say that everything is fair after you've given alleged, implicit permission by clicking a button either. It's about a reasonable expectation the user has about what kind of terms he's entering into by 'like-ing' something. Is it okay for Facebook to have a look at what site your coming form? Associate your account with this like? Maybe. Would it be acceptable for Facebook to go through your history and look at the most recent porn sites you showed interest in? Probably not. That goes at the notion of contextual integrity you mentioned. The line is blurry but it certainly exists.<p>Another important consideration for me is who has access to the data that is collected. Larry Page famously answered to Paul Buchheit that there 'are no privacy issues' when faced with thousands of complaints concerning Gmail. I don't really mind machines going over the contents of my email in an effort to target ads at me. It's creppy to some but if you understand the underlying technology I would side with Larry and say that, really, there are no privacy violations. It's about the trust you have in a corporation when it comes to handling your data. Transparency goes a long way.<p>Give me your thoughts.<p>P.S: I don't think an individual or a corporation could successfully operate on the internet while strictly adhering to the three standards you mention. Getting explicit consent for every data transaction that occurs when using the internet would make that medium virtually unusable.  We have to make certain, maybe gullible, assumptions about the companies and individuals we interact with to navigate everyday life; you do it every time you enter into a contract without studying the fine print.<p>A custom Facebook Share button sounds like a terrific idea, open-source it! :)",1313800126

2905373,comment,2904816,2905167,1,0,redthrowaway,,,"The rant really displayed a lack of understanding of what Anonymous is.  Anonymous is not Topiary and Samu, and they are not its leaders.  They're just by far the most active members as far as hacking is concerned, and they own the twitter accounts that, thanks to said hacking, are the most followed.  Had this guy, whose name I don't recognize, simply said, ""the actions of Topiary and Sabu are casting us in a bad light and I don't want to be associated with them"", that'd be fine.  Instead, he seems to think that the ""leaders"" of Anonymous are selling out the masses and taking Anonymous in a bad direction.  Topiary and Sabu are only involved in AnonOPs, the @AnonymousIRC and @AnonymousSabu twitter accounts, and Lulz/AntiSec.  There's a ton of other Anonymous forums and operations that have nothing to do with those activities.<p>His rant displayed an outsider's understanding of how Anon works.  Even back in the trolling days, there were Anonymous factions on all of the various /i/ boards operating mostly independently, as well as the WhyWeProtest crowd continuing with their chanology stuff.  420chan launched the raid on the Epilepsy Foundation [1] while the Scientology stuff was going on.  There was much wringing of hands and kvetching about how ""this makes us look bad"", etc, but the fact is they are two distinct groups.  Similarly, there isn't a whole lot of overlap between the AntiSec guys and those who DDoSed PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard, or prepared aid packages for Tunisians.  The claims that this guy made don't reflect an understanding of that reality.<p>[1] <a href=""http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/Epilepsy_Foundation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/Epilepsy_Foundation</a>",1313799483

I configured it in 1993 running CERN/3.0, and it&#x27;s still running in production use 22 years later.  Admittedly, it&#x27;s not on the original Sun IPC hardware anymore; sometime in the late 1990s it was moved to a Sparcstation 4, and there it remains.  It stopped being our primary webserver about ten years back, but still handles all the staff webpages in production use:<p>bash-3.2$ telnet www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk 80<p>...<p>GET /staff/M.Handley/ HTTP/1.0<p>HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows<p>MIME-Version: 1.0<p>Server: CERN/3.0<p>Date: Fri, 13 Feb 2015 21:19:43 GMT<p>...<p>So, 22 year old webserver software running on 19 year old hardware.

Once you have dynamic dispatch, you suddenly have vtables. But who decides what those vtables look like? Where do they reside in memory? What&#x27;s the layout of that? If a struct suddenly has an is-a pointer, where is that mentioned in the code? Now my struct isn&#x27;t just a struct.<p>I love the rust idea that tons of modern language design still allows for zero-cost abstraction. Inheritance in dispatch starts getting into the land of &quot;putting a lot more stuff in my binary than I asked you to&quot;, and I would argue that it&#x27;s this property more than anything else that keeps embedded programmers and kernel guys safely in the minimalistic land of C.<p>It would be nice to have a new C, finally. But the more a language has an opinion on runtime layout, behavior, and symbol names, the less C-like it becomes.<p>Rust got this right when it decided that GC was NOT the correct default behavior for a language. The reason you see people playing with OS kernels in rust and not as much in D is, I think, mainly due to this decision. I think rust should continue carrying this torch.<p>If not for the ability to have the best of both worlds (a modern language and access to to-the-metal programming with a controllable runtime layout and deterministic performance profile), where exactly is the value in learning how to use the borrow checker?",1423862429

VoIP can generate terabytes of <i>signalling</i> data a day, even while not making much money. (In wholesale, many calls simply don&#x27;t complete, so you&#x27;ve got a huge amount of data and transactions that pay you $0.)<p>The challenge with F# is controlling memory usage. Even one extra allocation per packet can make a measureable difference in performance. I ended up doing a ton of unsafe code and manually managing most of the heap. Rust allows me to write fairly high-level code (not as expressive as F# yet but whatever) while getting &quot;best&quot; performance. Inline asm is a bonus, as there&#x27;s some algorithms for integer compression that can use SIMD for big wins (I can do that in .NET, but it&#x27;s ugly, and doing it safely means a ~30 instruction thunk). And sometimes in tight loops, I&#x27;ve found it difficult to get .NET to do acceptable codegen, causing double-digit% impacts.<p>There&#x27;s also the safety issues writing unsafe code for network-exposed traffic. So Rust is actually <i>more</i> safe than .NET, because I have to toss .NET&#x27;s safety to gain performance.<p>The backend management code I can continue to write in F#, and Rust&#x27;s C-compatibility means it&#x27;s trivial to interop the code. So I can do &quot;orchestration&quot; of indexing daemons and management APIs and such things in a higher-level language, then for actual indexing and whatnot, just jump over to Rust, seamlessly.<p>Finally the static compilation means a smoother installation experience for customers. And if I ever ship a closed-source module that executes on the client, I don&#x27;t need to license Mono for static linking. So that&#x27;s nice. And the safety guarantees are good, because similar, existing, software in C has put customers at risk before. (I&#x27;m not sure if I can effectively market that last part, but hey.)<p>Rust would appear to have a unique value proposition and I&#x27;m very pleased to see it progressing so damn well.",1423862062

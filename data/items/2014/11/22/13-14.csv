8645546,comment,8639317,8645379,0,0,byuu,,,"> Sorry, it was not my intent to &quot;play this up as a bogeyman&quot;<p>Okay, my apologies as well then. It was hard to get a read from just that one sentence with the word kernel emphasized.<p>> (Do audio devices support floating point formats nowadays?)<p>Natively, no. You can be lazy and do it anyway in software mixing though.<p>> I just find it amusing how a monolithic design of doing all audio stuff in the kernel is held up by some as an example of reliability and as superior to a more modular design that is more in line with the UNIX philosophy.<p>Certainly, it would be ideal if everything non-critical were in user space. But audio in the kernel is probably at the <i>very bottom</i> of the list. Audio mixing is maybe 0.0001% of the kernel code, and is some of the safest, simplest arithmetic code imaginable. It&#x27;s worrying about the one ant you saw on the counter when your entire house is infested with termites.<p>> About the KMS however, I&#x27;ve heard that DisplayPort link training has latency requirements that are difficult to meet in anything but a kernel interrupt handler<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true or not, but I am running a DisplayPort monitor (ZR30w) now without KMS, and it works fine. Obviously the video driver is still running in kernel mode, but at least it&#x27;s a module outside of the kernel itself that runs after my system is booted.<p>What I&#x27;d really like to see is distros and vendors instead relying on UEFI GOP for boot-time mode setting.<p>> Also X servers have traditionally needed direct PCI bus access to get the hardware initialized<p>Well, compare it to audio. Eventually even a userland mixer will have to send the samples through some sort of hardware interface. But if your goal is stability, then it would be ideal to get as much code out of the kernel as possible.<p>> and to what extent due to actual technical limitations and additional complexity of a microkernel architecture.<p>Certainly nothing is ever perfect. There are so many potential problems with computers. Cosmic rays can flip bits in your RAM if you don&#x27;t shell out an extra $500 for the premium CPU, mainboard and ECC RAM. Strong enough power surges (lightning) can burn through and destroy absolutely any running computing equipment. Hardware can literally fail and take down your system. Things can overheat, there can be design flaws in the silicon itself, etc.<p>So I look at it like OpenBSD looks at security. You want to stack all the protections you can. Mirror your drives, use ECC RAM, don&#x27;t run anything in kernel space you don&#x27;t have to, try and build as much redundancy and safety as you can into the system. It won&#x27;t be perfect, but every bit will help increase uptime.<p>...<p>So again, sure, audio should preferably be in user space. Just, it&#x27;s many thousands of times worse that video isn&#x27;t even trying to do this, and is in fact going in the opposite direction to become <i>more</i> tightly coupled with the kernel.",1416664526

8645542,comment,8642255,8642255,0,0,padobson,,,"Ok, so this makes a lot of sense for renewable sources of energy like wind and solar - production facilities that are distant from bodies of water can store surplus energy during peak production times (windy or sunny days) and then use that stored surplus when production is stagnant (calm days or at night).<p>The current practice is to use surplus energy to pump water into a reservoir during peak production, and then converting it to hydro-electric power later when production is stagnant. The Isentropic advantage is that you don&#x27;t need a reservoir to store the energy, the storage system can be build regardless of geography.<p>I have two questions:<p>1. What kind of insulation does it take to keep the gravel hot or cold enough to store the energy for a long time? Is the energy lost due to natural thermodynamic processes comparable to energy lost due to evaporation in a pumped-hydro storage system?<p>2. If the storage system is geographically independent, could it be moved in an energy efficient manner? The problem with almost every energy source we have right now is that it has to be close to the population it serves. On the other hand, if we could generate everyone&#x27;s electricy as solar energy in Nevada or nuclear energy hundreds of miles from populations, and then move it to distribution plants, then we could answer a lot of energy questions.",1416664403

Nothing is stopping you from creating a systemd-portable project, similar to how OpenSSH-portable makes OpenSSH usable on non-OpenBSD platforms.<p>As to logind, it may have been a better choice for the long term to do a separate implementation of the public and stable logind DBus API instead of trying to run the systemd-logind implementation without systemd as PID1, but supposedly whoever did the latter thought it was the best short-term choice.",1416664362
8645538,comment,8641126,8643577,0,0,orbifold,,,"Take OCaml for comparison: It has a more or less reasonable way of extending the language with an extensible parser camlp4 that ultimately yields a fixed AST. No one would get the idea to use it just for fun, or one-shot abstractions, but it is integrated into the toolchain well enough that you can reliably distribute libraries that use syntax extensions. The general attitude that &quot;coders are dumb, we need to protect them from themselves&quot; lead to the development of mediocre languages like Java. Compare that to something like Racket, where despite some flaws most of the macros provide an obvious and very real benefit, without overcomplicating the compiler (for example the match macro, or the macros that constitute the C-FFI). Ideally in my eyes a language should provide the programmer with maximal possible expressiveness without compromising a core simple design.",1416664215

A few things have changed/updated/evolved, but a couple hours with the man pages would bring them right up to date.<p>OpenBSD is about very gradual evolution, not revolution.<p>My sense is that OpenBSD is not designed for Watches, Tablets, or SmartPhones.  It is a world class Server, Firewall, Router, networking device, networking appliance operating system, and it&#x27;s unlikely to ever lose that focus.<p>I&#x27;m pretty confident that we won&#x27;t see anything like systemd confusing everyone on OpenBSD as long as Theo continues his steady management at the helm.  Systemd actually serves some pretty important functions on systems that have a lot of dynamic services going up and down with dependencies, particularly on low-power devices, and on systems that require rapid parallel process initiation - so I&#x27;m not hating on systemd here, just appreciating the consistency that we find in OpenBSD.",1416661836

As soon as the interest rate is allowed to tick upward, the banks will plough that money into things, but while rates are low they can make more money by gambling. However, when that interest rate ticks upward, you will suddenly see a lot of land slip into negative-equity. This will temporarily destroy much of the house sales market while at the same time putting a lot of land going cheap at auction, meaning that the banks will put that money into new-build as that will bring more profit, so there should be a massive construction boom, while those in the middle who rely on being property owners will see their wealth diluted further.

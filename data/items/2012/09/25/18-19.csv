It required a LOT of discipline and extremely careful calorie counting, but it definitely worked.<p>Being in my late 20s now, 1250kcal is just not sustainable, but going with keto is working great and is likely to remain so for a long time.  It helps that all I ever drink are water, tea, black coffee, and milk.  (That's been the case my entire life, so that part isn't unusual.)<p>I eat eggs/sausage/bacon for breakfast (one of the three), then I eat an earlyish dinner of steak or bratwurst.  Since I'm on Adderall XR, lunch never happens.  On days I feel like carbs, I go out to Ivanna Cone (amazing local gourmet ice cream) for half a scoop.  That consistently puts me at less than 30g of non-fiber carbs per day, with a fairly steady decline in overall weight.  I'm never hungry outside of meal time, and I don't have problems saying no to carbs, aside from when I'm eating out with friends.<p>Once I've lost the weight I want to lose (another 20 pounds or so) I'll be able to figure out what level of carbs I can have without gaining on a daily basis, and live with that.<p>I have to eat carefully, but not eating carefully is what got me fat in the first place, so that's just what I'll have to deal with.",1348599575

4572032,comment,4569513,4569513,5,0,beagle3,,,"REBOL is very impressive.<p>My favorite programming language is K, which is super fast, super terse, and completely eschews modern abstraction paradigms like Object Orienter Programming. (Opened a file? get an int selector. Want to define your own data type? Sorry dude, you have to make do with the built in int+double+string+symbol+date+time+list+dict. That kind of spartan). K programs tend to be 10-100 times shorter than the equivalent C++, and of comparable speed.<p>REBOL is super terse and compact, but it is otherwise the complete opposite: It has tens of built in types (file, money, email, internet address, color), lets you modify its syntax and even encourages that (define new ""dialects"").<p>REBOL programs that don't deal with math tend to have comparable length (in term of tokens, not characters) to the equivalent K program, while having abstraction facilities almost on par with LISP. That's quite amazing.<p>Unfortunately, it is also the complete opposite of K in terms of speed ... It's rather slow.<p>Both languages clock at a complete implementation (no dependency beyond basic OS) at ~300K while providing quite a bit GUI and some batteries (In the case of K, a full fledged ACID hot-standby order-enhanced relational database; In the case of REBOL, everything you need to do internets including mostly complete mail/ftp/http protocol implementations, sophisticated GUI layout, and a lot more).<p>My dream language would be something that is fast and terse like K, but has all the REBOL built-ins and abstraction mechanisms. I'm not sure if such a language can exist, or how it would look. But I would like one of those.",1348599521

One thing I would like to point out is that although the education given by Georgia Tech is excellent, I think that the real reason graduates make so much money is because of the Coop/internship program and the international studies program. It was why I chose to come here in the first place. I don't know the exact statistic but I believe more than 50% of students in Georgia Tech do a coop. In my major (Industrial Engineering), 70% of students do some sort of study abroad or work abroad.<p>Students that do coops usually get hired by the companies they coop for and they are usually hired at a position higher than entry level. This I believe explains the higher starting salary.",1348599388
4572018,comment,4571523,4571874,2,0,rayiner,,,"It depends on where you live and what your priorities are. I grew up in an 1,150 square foot house in the DC suburbs. My parents had two kids. The house is now worth about $390k, according to Zillow. For that much money I can buy a 1,300 square foot condo in Lincoln Park, Chicago. No back yard, except for the 1,200 acre park next door with zoo, duck pond, flower conservatory, etc. Good public school within walking distance (how many dads can walk their kids to school every morning?) The central business district is a 10 minute walk + 12 minute subway ride from the school.<p>I agree that not everyone has options like that, but I think people make it harder on themselves than they need to. A lot of people have kids and decide they couldn't possibly raise their kids anywhere except a far-out suburb with 1 acre for the dogs to run around in. They spend just as much money for a house as they would in the city, except they get 1,000 extra square feet they use to store a lot of junk. Then they complain about their commute and all the traffic. They do it because well their parents did it and oh cities are so dangerous, forgetting that teenage driving is a much bigger danger to a middle-class kid than city crime. There is a lot of inertia built-into peoples' choices in this matter, IMHO.",1348599365

I haven't popped open any NES games, but I'd have to guess most, if not all NES games just used a Famicom sized board to simplify manufacturing. Here's a comparison shot of the NES and Famicom versions of Super Mario Bros. 3:<p><a href=""http://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/smb3j_label/nesfam_2_large.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/smb3j_labe...</a><p>While most later systems featured mostly standardized cartridge designs, Famicom carts wildly vary in color and design from publisher to publisher. They're quite pleasing to look at:<p><a href=""http://famicomblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/aesthetics-of-famicom-cart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://famicomblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/aesthetics-of-famico...</a><p>Another piece of trivia: The Famicom had a 60 pin cartridge port, while the NES had a 72 pin cartridge port (iirc they removed a few pins, relocated a few from the Famicom's bottom port, and added pins for the lockout chips). A few early games literally consisted of a Famicom game board plugged into an internal 60-to-72 pin adapter. So, for a while, the cheapest way to get a Famicom converter was to rip apart a cheap game like Gyromite and hope it was part of a certain run. You can see the converter clearly here:<p><a href=""http://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/gyro/gyro7_big.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/gyro/gyro7_big.jp...</a><p>As for technical details, you're mostly on the dot, but most later games also featured mapper circuitry to allow the NES to address more memory. Some boards used simple 7400 series, while others used customs ICs, some of which were fairly expensive, to expand the system's capabilities. Simpler ones just allowed for more complex bank switching schemes, while the most expensive ones featured things like interrupt generators and additional sound generating hardware. The sky is the limit for what you can stuff in a game cartridge, so the NES and SNES were designed to be very expandable through their cartridge ports. That's part of what makes cartridge-based games special to me; they're not just data on a disc, they're full-fledged hardware extensions of their host console.",1348598802

On the desktop site, I get a home page filled with images of products that I'm probably interested in based on my previous Amazon habits.  On the mobile site, I mostly get text with a small image advertising the Kindle Fire.  If I browse to books, I get ~5 list items on the screen at one time, vs the desktop version (on my mobile) that gives me a landing page of bestsellers and books tailored to my interests.  There's a whole layer of functionality missing on the mobile version for the sake of formatting that I don't honestly need.  The reason why the original iPhone's web browser was so amazing was that it made it comfortable and efficient to browse full desktop web pages on a small screen via the whole pinch to zoom action.  On a text heavy page, if I double tap it reflows the whole page to fit text on my screen.<p>Now, I'm not totally against mobile sites.  I've seen some truly wonderfully designed mobile sites like Google's main page and some from design centric companies who don't rely heavily on long lists or grids of items.

Users want to pinch to zoom and drag and double tap.<p>No I'm asking about click through rates to full sites.

Harassing them about it through this channel seems like a waste of their time.</i><p>Let's consider protest via sit-ins at Local Business Foo for its socially-irresponsible but entirely-legal policy/action of Bar. There are plenty of places to protest those actions/policies. Various municipal bodies (city council, chamber of commerce) and private bodies (better business bureau, etc.) are all channels designed for handling complaint. It is precisely because of these channels exist that more a unconventional method of complaint is more notable and thus potentially more effective. In such cases involving a local business, you are most definitely <i>wasting someone's time</i>, far beyond the bounds of deleting or invalidating a bug tracking ticket.<p>As a qualification, I recognize that, depending on the topic of protest, there can be a gap/disconnect in the severity of the topic of protest. The cultural go-to for the words ""sit-in protest"" evokes imagery of the American civil-rights era, whereas this is an affiliate monetization scheme for an open source operating system.

Public transit should only charge fees as a means of controlling the number of people using the system (in other words, as low as possible to maximize usage but high enough to reduce overcrowding).<p>In other words, make people that want to drive subsidize public transit.

Some of these arguments could be applied to all mobile sites, not just responsive sites. If that's the case, we've debated the value of mobile sites for years and mobile sites have clearly won.<p>1. It Defeats User Expectation  This is not a fault of responsive design, but rather the designer. We need more, skilled responsive designers. A responsive site should act and feel like a regular mobile site.<p>2. It Costs More and Takes Longer  A mobile site usually requires two separate code bases. With a responsive site, you can maintain both the desktop and mobile experiences from the same place. Also, a good responsive designer is cheaper than a desktop and mobile designer. If it's costing more, you're doing it wrong.<p>3. Non-Responsive Designs Usually Work  This isn't specifically targeted at responsive design, but rather all mobile websites. By your logic, any mobile site is subpar. While I think you should always include a link to the desktop version (which can be easily achieved by switching out the stylesheet), I don't think desktop sites are superior. A desktop view might be appealing to a small percentage of power users, but the majority of users will appreciate a tailored experience. Just don't hide functionality. You should be able to accomplish the same tasks on mobile that can be achieved on the desktop.<p>4. There is Often No Load Time Benefit  You're doing it wrong. A good responsive design will have a much lighter weight than a desktop version. There is no reason a responsive site can't function in the same manner and achieve the same performance  as a mobile website.<p>5. Its a Compromise  Again, this is a power user issue. Always offer the option to view the desktop version.<p>It is silly to argue against mobile design. Screen real-estate is more valuable on a mobile device and our designs should reflect that. If your argument is responsive design doesn't offer performance benefits, than you probably need to reconsider your workflow and RWD structure.",1348597068

4571775,comment,4571551,4571551,20,0,ianstormtaylor,,,"I agree with people arguing that flat design's run the risk of not giving users enough information to know what are buttons and what aren't. That is one of the biggest challenges to using a flat aesthetic. It's easy to take for granted how much information gradients and drop shadows provide to the user. Which is why I've appropriated your style of combining flat UI with drop shadows for depth. The drop shadows add just enough dimension that they can be used to express hierarchy without making the interface dishonest.<p>What I love most about flat design is that it forces you to simplify, since you aren't giving the user as much visual information. The flat aesthetic magnifies any clutter, because objects and shapes don't communicate their ""possession"" as much, so having too many pieces on the page at once doesn't work. Remove a line here or a drop shadow there. Make your text more succinct. It's awesome. It might even be a good challenge for startups, just because it forces you to focus your product more.<p>A huge bonus for me to flat design is that I'm not constrained by my earlier true-to-life decisions like gradients and drop shadows. Before I started using a flat aesthetic, I'd often run into situations where I couldn't place a button or a plane right where I wanted it, because it would contradict the other dimensionality that my gradients and drop shadows were creating. I'm glad to be rid of those constraints now (or almost).<p>Though, I'm always scared that we'll a/b test a gradient-filled button on our call to action and it'll crazily out-perform our flat one.<p>---<p>It might depend on who the interface is for. But it also depends on what the interface is for. LayerVault is a perfect example of an interface that needs to recede when a user is viewing their own work. You don't want your flashy buttons competing for their attention. Similarly, with Segment.io, I don't want all of our UI to be competing with the data we show in graphs.",1348596729

For example, if we standardized around these login emails being sent from login@url.com, then you could set up a rule to automatically delete any email from login@url.com after 5 minutes. Over time, if this caught on, you could imagine this being standard practice by email clients vs. a custom rule.<p>This of course only solves problem (1) that you mentioned and possibly(?) (2) partially.<p>It occurs to me that this is kind of an interesting evolution of systems like 1Password, where the user experience is very similar: you have one password that gives you access to other passwords. Similarly here, your ""one password"" is your email password, and that gives you access to what is conceptually a new password on every login (vs a pre-generated one).<p>I wonder if we couldn't solve 3 and 1 together by creating a ""login email provider"". For example, pretend dropbox wanted to offer this service. Dropbox gives you an @dropbox.com email specifically for logging into places. When a login email was sent to you, you would go to dropbox and navigate to the logins tab, which would have a very non-emaily interface showing you the last login links that were sent to you (again, auto deleted after 5 minutes -- and since this is not meant to be used as normal email there is no expectation for them to last longer). If websites only supported ""known"" services like @dropbox.com for this kind of login, then the (3) could be solved.

The author claimed that this is the only way to use go because you can't have circular deps.  Well, this is where structurally-typed interfaces come in to play -- you shouldn't have a circular dependency, it is just that your interfaces need to be compatible.  For instance, each of the parts of the standard library is its own package... there is no circular dep on the ""reader"" interface, things just implement Read() and it ""just works"" (and is enforced by the compiler at link time.)<p>Having 700 files in one package is an abuse of api.",1348596271

We use MongoDB because  a really good use case for it is to just store JSON documents with a unique id. We only run simple queries on it - basically existential (does an id exist) or count.<p>We are aware that it's query performance is not as fast as that of a relational db. So we then index that data to ElasticSearch and run our advanced queries through that.\nWe are really happy with our current system and it has been working great.<p>If we had some sort of ""relational"" data with a fixed structure I sure has hell would have picked MySQL or PostgreSQL and used Sphinx on it for indexing.<p>Peace.",1348596151

Since this type of transformation is not possible we never see truly free energy. There are lots of systems which have things in motion, and could in principle stay in motion forever, that do not provide free energy because the amount of energy going out = the amount of energy going in = zero. A pendulum in a vacuum is an example.<p>If you want an analogy to the quantum situation of a time clock spinning around you can think of the penny rolling in a funnel. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2awnAeuFbc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2awnAeuFbc</a> If there were no friction then the penny would never fall through the hole.

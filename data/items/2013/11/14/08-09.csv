In it&#x27;s simplest form I might sell a coin to somebody for cash, the blockchain does not show this change of ownership and an outside observer now thinks that they are still monitoring the same persons transactions. If they were &quot;blacklisted&quot; then suddenly the sold coins are worthless, even though the original seller has had no adverse impact.<p>It has interesting extensions, where you are able to destroy other people&#x27;s funds by tainting them with your stolen ones. The Bitcoin system does not, and can not support a system where the user can accept and reject funds. You can ignore inputs, but that gets very messy very quickly.<p>You end up in a situation where only institutionally &quot;clean&quot; coins are allowed, and the system collapses.

6731345,comment,6716822,6718688,1,0,mcv,,,"It seems the author is unwilling to acknowledge the impact money has on satisfaction or happiness. But utility and happiness are two different things.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that walking to work makes you happier, but you can&#x27;t go to a shop and exchange that walk for a bigger house or a nice vacation. Money can do that. If you&#x27;re unhappy with the communte, you can spend the extra money on getting more happiness out of other aspects of your life. That is utility.<p>It&#x27;s silly to argue that money doesn&#x27;t provide utility; nothing provides such flexible, universal and measurable utility as money does. But does it buy you happiness? Only if you&#x27;re poor, other research has shown. Once you have comfortable wealth, money stops providing additional happiness.<p>So overpaid CEOs should take a pay cut to be able to walk to the office.<p>(Would he accept an hour-long communte for $500 extra per month?

6731341,comment,6718427,6729123,1,0,teddyh,,,"> we value the creative output of individuals<p>This all sounds good, but it is very theoretical.  Lets look at the more practical effects. As noted by many, the fact that the creative output of individuals can currently be owned has rather large drawbacks.  So what do we <i>gain</i> to potentially offset these drawbacks?  Note that these gains would have to be things we would actually <i>lose</i> if  creative output of individuals would cease to have property status.  Finally, are these gains large enough to overcome the drawbacks?<p>Furthermore, there are many who argue that, should the creative output of individuals cease to have limits on their dissemination and use, society would gain more than enough to offset any potential drawback of this.  It could also be argued that the cost would be entirely transitional, i.e. people would have to get used to new business models and move to different ways of doing business, and there would be otherwise <i>no</i> actual <i>continuous loss</i> by making the creative output of individuals non-owned.",1384419350

This is a plain common sense first order effect.<p>That there may be a <i>second order</i> effect via interest rates is somewhat plausible, but it just boggles the mind how many people seem to believe that this second order effect would ever trump the first order effect of savings decisions.

There&#x27;s some very clever API design going on here, and it&#x27;s clearly taking advantage of Go&#x27;s language features rather than just trying to be a clone of a framework from another language.<p>I particularly like the service injection concept. Django forces every view function to take a request object and return a response object. Flask makes these optional, but then requires you to use global variables to access more information from the request. Martini attempts to resolve any arguments it sees by looking up their static type against a service directory. I think that&#x27;s really clever.<p>The way it allows you to stack up Handlers is neat too. Django does this with either globally applied middleware or per-view-function decorators, but there&#x27;s something really neat about just taking a list of functions for things like authentication and &quot;stacking&quot; them on top of each other - or having that same function applied as middleware to every request using m.Use(func...). Using Context.Next() to allow that middleware to &quot;wrap&quot; a request (the equivalent of Django&#x27;s process_request and process_response pair) is clever as well.<p>Colour me impressed!",1384417769

You get $150,000 + 10% <i>if the company survives</i>. REMEMBER: Most startups fail.<p>Or If you&#x27;re a capable developer you could be earning $150,000/year in a soulless job working for a boring financial institution. Over 5 years that&#x27;s $600,000 in cold hard cash <i>guaranteed</i>.<p>Consequently, for that 10% to be financially worthwhile the company would need to exit and give you the $450,000 you&#x27;ve given up + a bit more - so a $4.5m deal. How likely is that?<p>That&#x27;s a hellishly over simplified example. All sorts of things make it more complicated. In reality your stake is very likely to be diluted over subsequent rounds. Every round <i>roughly</i> halves what you own. So after a couple of rounds you&#x27;re down to 2.5% (the good news is that each round should raise enough to stick another 0 on the end of the valuation of course). You might be able to buy in at some point in a future round too. And so on.<p>And, of course, this ignores the fact that startup life is <i>fun</i> and <i>interesting</i>, which makes up for a lot more money than you might imagine.<p>Ultimately, what you really ought to do is disregard the equity and take the job if it sounds like something you want to do all day, like something that will get you out of bed in the morning, and you can afford to live without an income for a while.

The political goons decide, however, if the software, ideas and information itself, once created, should possess the status of property.<p>I am arguing the side that claims that these non-rivalrous goods like software, ideas and information should be <i>changed</i> to no longer be considered property and have owners.  I have demonstrated that there are compelling arguments why their status as property has downsides, and why eliminating their being owned should, at least, have no appreciable downsides, and could potentially be a boon to all society.  You, however, seem to argue that since software, ideas and information are legally considered property (at least some of them, some of the time, in different forms), they <i>are</i> property.  But this would be assuming that the law is correct, and you cant do that, since this is the question to be resolved.<p>I would still like to know <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> we will devolve into Soviet-style bleakness if software and ideas would no longer be granted property status.  As a comparison, you could look at the clothing industry. There are no ownerships of patterns or designs there, but the industry continue to be needed and people are still paid to produce clothes.  The odd cases of illegal copies you hear about are about <i>trademark law</i>, i.e. things fraudulently claiming to be a particular brand, but this is an issue of fraud and consumer protection against low-quality knockoffs, not a design or pattern property issue, since the designs of clothes <i>are not property</i>.",1384416478

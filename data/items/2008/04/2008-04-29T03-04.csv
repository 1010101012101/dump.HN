176281,comment,176055,176055,0,0,yankees1,,,"I think I might give this a shot. I recently posted looking for a developer to work with as a co-founder and only had one bite. I'm going down the outsourcing route with one idea right now. I'm also trying to teach myself Ruby as I type this entry. I've seen lots of complaints here from developers dealing with douchebag MBAs. I'd like to find some developers with some balls to invest their time without putting cash in their hands.",1209441492
176280,comment,175864,176161,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Yes, but we tend to collaborate with members of our own species and enslave/butcher/experiment on other species.  Even our relationships with dogs and other family pets can be highly unequal and sometimes downright disturbing.  (Treating them as chattel, ""putting them to sleep"" when it's more convenient to do so.)  So this counts against your position in two ways: 1) our only data point indicates that interspecies collaboration is likely to be less than cozy 2) others might observe our treatment of other species and use that to evaluate our potential for hostility.<p>Also, our record with regards to polluting our own environment doesn't recommend us highly as ""good citizens of the galaxy.""  (This was brought up as a possibility in David Brin's Sundiver series.)<p>And this isn't even considering the vast differences in culture and even basic mental models there will likely be. It's far from a sure bet that this openness will extend to us.<p>Also, one can readily imagine how a ""innocuous"" act from the point of view of one species might be considered a greivous crime by another.  (The Ender's Game books are one example.)",1209441382

176278,comment,175755,175755,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I disagree with this advice in the general sense. There is a trend right now in Silicon Valley to have all manner of meetups and presentations. I've worked with tons of these guys and the majority of them are not going anywhere. You still need something worthwhile to present. A top-notch presentation about another new Ruby DSL for migrating data from MySQL to PostgreSQL is not going to help your career as much as writing Anywhere.FM in 3 months. If your work is good enough, you can always get someone better than you to do the talking.  Improving your communication skills can't hurt but it isn't the single most important thing you can do.",1209441159

It seems clear that his demeanor amped his conviction up to murder. But the jury didn't do that on a whim: Reiser managed to portrary himself as deceptive, evasive, and utterly unconcerned over the welfare of his family. That got factored in. How could it not?",1209441104

176275,comment,176098,176241,0,0,tptacek,,,"The ""friend/lover"" was not a serial killer. No professional who interviewed Sturgeon believes him. If they had, he would have been called to testify. The defense <i>had the option of calling him</i>; they chose not to, because they did not think he would help their case.<p>I find it ridiculous that the DA would have chosen to pursue a case against a lonely computer programmer instead of locking up a <i>serial killer</i>. You have to believe something pretty incredible to argue that Sturgeon was a real factor in this case.",1209440889
176274,comment,176098,176242,0,0,tptacek,,,"The jury was asked how confident they were. They had the option of returning not guilty, or even guilty of a lesser crime, such as manslaughter --- murder without intent.<p>You are obviously not as confident as the jury was. But you were not on the jury. The jury, given the facts of the case, appears to have been maximally confident about Reiser's culpability: they returned a verdict of premeditated malicious intentional murder, where they instead could have found that Reiser had accidentally killed Nina in the heat of a terrible argument.<p>At a certain point, you just have to let go of the fact that you disagree with the jury. Clearly, we cannot simply poll every person on the country as to what they thought of the case from afar.",1209440750
176273,comment,176098,176191,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""He is an extraordinarily smart person, a valuable member of society, and could have made significant accomplishments in the next 25 years with his intelligence and experience.""<p>I really don't like this line of argument, because it implies that if he were <i>not</i> an extraordinarily smart person, a valuable member of society, without significant accomplishments, then he should be convicted.  If it were a homeless divorced guy living out of his minivan, should he have been convicted?  How about a blue-collar landscaper?  An unemployed househusband?<p>A society's standards of justice say far more about the society than they do about the people who go on trial before them.  We have laws instead of kings because there's this wonderful innovation called ""equal before the law"".  We owe a lot of Western civilization to that.<p>The part I find disturbing is that he was essentially convicted because <i>the jury didn't like him</i>.  I know this happens all the time - this is why lawyers have you wear a suit in court, and why they agonize over whether you should testify or not, and why they coach you on what to say on the stand, and why they have closing arguments.  But it's usually not quite so overt.  He made an ass out of himself at his own trial - I'd like to believe that it shouldn't matter when ""justice is blind"", but of course it does, and that's why he's going to jail.",1209440661

Now it's mentioned in NS I have to rush like there's no tomorrow.<p>The n-back test is basically a short term memory task. It is has been found to be a strong indicator of fluid intelligence because it is determined by attention and ability to manipulate and perform comparisons on objects stored in the STM buffer. 2-back test is fairly easy without distractions; 3-back becomes very taxing for the untrained.

(I'm only 20, so what do I know anyway?)<p>There are proportionally few people who are murderously inclined.  It's worth risking them if it means that no innocents are convicted.  Perfect murders are unlikely, and they become more unlikely as forensic technology improves.  It's best for a prison sentence to be based on a proof, but if we can't be positive about a person's guilt then we should favor the possibility of innocence.",1209438898

The basic concept is quite simple and it is easy to get up-and-running if you have experience with client-side and server-side scripting.<p>For me, the firebug tool for firefox was indispensable as it allows you to see the requests that are being sent out and received from the server, information you have no easy way to get at without such a tool.<p>Once you are up and running with the basics, the magic of AJAX will no longer be so mysterious and you can move on to one of the frameworks for adding cross-browser compatibility (I like jquery personally).",1209438440

Anyone who posted the content and wants to challenge that notice can also do so, resulting in the restoration of the content, but not until a few days later.""<p>No. Anyone. Period.<p>""In the long run, this mechanism does not suppress free speech or prevent the information from being distributed if proper counters are filed. However, in the short term it can delay that distribution. This is still potentially significant, but it is a different situation.""<p>Again incorrect. DMCA states that to file a counter notice, you are allowing the DMCA violation filer to go after you in court in their country. So if I am from France and post an article about The Church of Scientology, to counter the DMCA I would have to allow TCOS to sue me in US courts, not in my country's courts. The reason I mention TCOS is because they abused DMCA a few years back silencing most information online giving them negative PR. Only few actually filed counter notices.<p>In general most people don't file counter-notices because their are either scared about legal procedings or don't know what part hit the DMCA clause, don't want to be taken to court (remember the DMCA notice does not mean the person even knows who you are, they just got information forwarded through the ISP or whatever service) while the counter notice reveals who you are.",1270659461

Examine how that judgment is arrived at:<p>First, there is a background of a lot of <i>theistic</i> teaching regarding elaborate <i>theories</i> of morality.  Second, there are elaborate machinations of the state and the clerics that make it possible to even conceive of arresting the men.   You and I, I hope you agree, would find the arrest immoral even while those performing it would insist on its high morality.  The difference is that you and I have to agree on little other than what we see happening to reach our shared conclusion, while the defenders of the arrest rely on an elaborate analytics of morality.<p>That's actually one of Hitchens' main themes: that the elaborate analytics or morality, most especially the analytics given forth by all of the worlds theologies, don't create morality but rather often the opposite.<p>Do the Mutaween know right from wrong?  Or the the other groups that you mention?   I don't think that there is one answer that applies to the whole group just as there is no one answer that applies to all atheists.   Some see it.  Some don't.<p>As Hitchens might put it, I can not seriously entertain here, among civilized people, that such an arrest is moral.  And I observe that such an arrest is a byproduct of the actions of a theology that claims for itself a unique and privileged understanding of morality.<p>As a (half-gruesome) thought experiment, consider presenting to a pre-verbal child of any culture the image of two men kissing, and the image of dog abuse.  Which do you think will more consistently upset the child?",1270657825

Have more on this topic?<p>Few points he talks about:<p>- In processed/fast food foods, fiber is often taken out to make shipping easier and cooking faster.  This is the only reason fiber isn't seen as an essential nutrient in this country.  Without the fiber, the appetite doesn't get quenched as quickly  (as the food doesn't go through you as quickly) and so you eat more.<p>- Stress increases appetite.<p>- Sugar, fructose, and high fructose corn syrup do not suppress the appetite either.  Also, drinking/eating soda/juice/sugary foods with a meal delays the satiety signal.  This means you don't feel the fullness as quickly when sweetness is in your food/drink and so you eat more.<p>- Adding sugar to a salty food (and vice versa) neutralizes the salty/sweetness on your tongue.  Companies often make use of this fact.  For example, Coke has come out with new formulas where the only change is increased sodium and increased sugar/high fructose corn syrup to counterbalance.<p>- High Fructose Corn Syrup was created in Japan.  HFCS is so widely used because it is so super super cheap compared to other sweeteners.  He jokes that Japan sent it to the US as revenge.",1270657239

Making money on tech and then re-investing that money into new tech is basically the whole premise of the business.

Pyramid schemes are even less similar. A pyramid-scheme way of funding tech startups would be: you put in $1000 towards funding the current round of startups, and in return, get your name put on a list of startups that'll get funded in the next round. The direction of money flow is different: in a pyramid scheme, tomorrow's startups are funding today's startups, while in a Ponzi scheme, today's startups are funding other startups of today with money they don't have yet (which they hope to get from tomorrow's investors in an exit). In a normal, non-fraudulent investment scheme (like this one), today's startups will, in the future, fund tomorrow's startups, once they have the money to do so.",1270657106

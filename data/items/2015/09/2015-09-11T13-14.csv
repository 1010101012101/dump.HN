Kleiner reportedly had four full-time PR people plus their defense lawyer arguing their points and providing information and their perspective to the press in real-time during the trial. Their efforts contributed to online aggression against me personally, and even toward my family, leading to what is now viewed as the one of the largest trolling attacks in history.<p>I find it spectacularly weird that she thinks the reddit backlash against her was orchestrated by a PR firm.<p>Just so spectacularly weird.",1441979962

10203653,comment,10203102,10203102,0,0,Cshelton,,,"This happens quite a bit in many other service industries.<p>Like others said, stop doing any additional work. If you are hosting it right now, take it down. Even the demo.<p>Legally there isn&#x27;t much you&#x27;ll be able to do that won&#x27;t cost you more than the amount they owe you. You can try small claims court in the county where the offense took place, so where you live. That&#x27;s usually under $100 to file and have the defendant be served, depending where they live.<p>Unfortunately, this is part of business. I have seen many times where after 6 months..1 year...even 2 years later, the client comes back and now needs to finish it. This could be for many reasons,  maybe the found somebody else and it was a shitty product and now they have to double down on their mistake. Either way, if they come back, get an upfront retainer! Plus all previous invoices they haven&#x27;t paid of course. If I know a client is sketchy and they pay late or sometimes never, any additional work will always be paid upfront.<p>You would do well to have an accounting system you use. So If somebody owes you money, that is a balance on your accounts receivables. If they don&#x27;t pay it, you can write it off as an expense of unpaid earnings. This has tax advantages, depending on your size and all. So possibly look into that. It&#x27;s a good thing to have. Even if you are a sole freelancer, there are many free apps out there to do this.<p>Another suggestion is anytime you do work, have a client engagement letter. This type of thing is required in many service industries, accounting, law, etc. but it really is a good idea. Legally it may not help you at all, but it makes sure that the terms are more clear to the client and not just an oral agreement. It&#x27;s a simple way to have something in writing rather than having an entire detailed contract. Which for bog jobs, I would definitely have a contract.<p>At the end of the day, learn from it, it will happen again, trust me, and move on.",1441979764

10203644,comment,10187596,10200706,0,0,pluma,,,"That&#x27;s an intuitive assumption but it&#x27;s naive (i.e. it lacks understanding of the actual domain concerns).<p>JS in the browser needs to be sandboxed by default and has to handle concerns like cross-origin policies and interactively seeking user permissions. It also has some fairly browser-specific singletons (e.g. a shared global cookie storage).<p>The equivalent built-in node APIs are much more low-level, allowing developers to use abstractions that are useful in <i>their</i> problem domain.<p>Having an IndexedDB implementation in node core would be an incredibly pointless effort (most apps out there won&#x27;t use it) and bring with it several complications (e.g. pluggable storage backends and concurrency conflicts if you want multiple node processes to share the same database). Plus it would mean the Node Foundation would have to get involved in the standardization process to make its concerns heard and likely introduces concerns that are irrelevant to everyone else (i.e. browser vendors).<p>Don&#x27;t forget that Node is not a web framework. It&#x27;s a JS runtime environment. It is primarily used for things that talk over the web or that generate content for the web, but it&#x27;s not at all unreasonable to implement other things in it (e.g. mail servers). The web specs carry a lot of overhead that is simply unnecessary for most node applications even if it is perfectly necessary in browsers.<p>The only spec I can think of that I&#x27;d like to see in node is the Fetch API and for that we have node-fetch, which just wraps node&#x27;s low-level http module.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that node doesn&#x27;t need these high-level APIs because it can give you the low-level APIs to implement them with. Browsers can&#x27;t do this, so they need to work at an entirely different layer of abstraction. Plus node allows you to easily include native extensions whereas in the browser you can&#x27;t have that (except for NaCl).",1441979651

If you don&#x27;t publish RSS, how will people find your stuff? By visiting the home page of your site and looking for stuff they haven&#x27;t seen before? Sure, some people will do that. But people who read your site systematically, people who you would think of as members of your community, can benefit from more automatic notification. That&#x27;s what RSS is for. All kinds of networks have developed around RSS. If you don&#x27;t provide a feed, your site can&#x27;t participate in those networks.<p>Also, how do you think links make it to Twitter and Facebook? Very often they were posted by people who follow your site&#x27;s feed. So while most people aren&#x27;t aware they&#x27;re getting their links from feeds, they are.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of how the plumbing works in NYC, but I live there, and depend on it. Water flows in and out. Treated on both sides. RSS is the plumbing for news. It&#x27;s best when it just works without you having to even be aware of it.<p>Here&#x27;s an example. Sometimes I get so interested in a subject I put together a river site dedicated to news in that area. Earlier this week I did one for Major League Baseball.<p><a href=""http://mlbriver.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mlbriver.com/</a><p>The vast majority of the sites I went looking for feeds on had them, and they worked with my aggregator.

It needs to be installed on a smartphone or tablet and it will become the interface of all the network or bluetooth powered VIPER objects.<p>More technical details:<p>All the logic of interaction between the VIPER object and the App is written in Python, while the UI is specified in HTML and Javascript; this way it is possible to build mobile controlled objects without writing any Android code.<p>The VIPER App interfaces are based on HTML 5 templates that can be written directly in the VIPER IDE and transferred to the microcontroller flash together with bytecode. The App includes many famous Javascript libraries that can be included and used from the template.<p>Any data collected or generated by VIPER powered devices (i.e. room temperature, room light and sound level, etc.) can be shown on mobile by sending a notification from Python to the App. The communication also happens the other way round with the App sending events to the Python script which in turn can execute functions. Therefore the App can also work as a remote controller, by specifying in the Python script which event triggers a specific callback (e.g. a switch button in the App can turn a led on and off).",1441978552

I have had great success by charging clients [especially new ones] for &quot;blocks&quot; of hours.  If your rate per hour is $100, consider selling your client a 5 hour block for, say, $450 - or 10h for $925.  When you receive the check and it clears then get to work and keep going at your own pace till their &quot;hours balance&quot; goes to zero.  Then ask for another check if they want you to continue on the project.  They can buy more at any time.  I keep track of time to the 1/10 hour.  Tell them they can direct your efforts however they desire within the scope of what you are offering for a given rate.  Offer greater discounts for larger block sizes.  Unused hours expire or are fractionally reduced after 18 months... progress reports generated every 10 days or 10 hours used...  generate your own policies.<p>Start with the cash.

It sets up a timeline. Don&#x27;t fall for the &quot;just send us X and we will pay you&quot;.<p>Tip for the future: If a client exhibits a tendency to pay late, I place key assets (javascript, CSS, images) on my own server and link to them from their site. Once the work is paid for and/or the project completed, I upload stuff to their server on the hand-off.

If so, that means taking legal action. In my experience sometimes it&#x27;s worth suing a deadbeat, sometimes it isn&#x27;t. The high order bit on when it isn&#x27;t worth it is when the deadbeat has gone broke. The high order bit on when it is is a relationship that has devolved into &quot;Fuck you, Pay me.&quot; It&#x27;s rare that the emotional value of getting paid is worth the emotional cost and financial risk of suing. There are opportunity costs for a small business when resources are devoted to chasing deadbeats instead of new work.<p>Personally, I always use written contracts with clear payment and termination terms. Typically I require a meaningful retainer. The retainer gets applied against <i>final</i> invoice and is large enough that I shouldn&#x27;t have to go upside down where the client owes me money. This puts it in their interest to tell me explicitly if the project dies rather than implicitly via unpaid invoices. Whenever a client doesn&#x27;t pay an invoice without a heads up, I stop work and call.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: good clients are clients who intend to pay, and good clients are never offended by written contracts. The times when things need to  be loose with good clients is when speed is critical and there&#x27;s an established working relationship, and when speed is critical then all it takes is a check to get started. A client who balks at a contract or writing a retainer check is a red flag. If they can&#x27;t write a retainer, then they haven&#x27;t allocated the funds for my work. That&#x27;s not a good omen.<p>Good luck.",1441977750

And since one doesn't need to own a car anymore, the number of cars will be reduced.\nBringing together strangers on the same route will get a lot easier in the future. And if one isn't using one's own car but essentially a taxi, we'll see a lot more ride sharing.

4709185,comment,4709022,4709022,2,0,mistercow,,,"For years, I've toyed with a similar idea to this. I feel like a lot of work on this has relied on some pretty crude heuristics like ""rolls"" and ""alternation"". I think it's dangerous to overgeneralize about these, and I think it's also short-sighted because there are probably more specific patterns that affect typing speed.<p>So my idea was to collect data on all keystroke transitions. There are 1,089 of these on the part of the keyboard that you would optimize for. Typing 5 minutes a day at a relaxed pace would be enough time to cover each of those 8 times in a month, so collecting enough data to work with would be feasible pretty quickly. I was then going to take a big textual corpus of English, and the total of all transition times would serve as the fitness function.<p>I had the data collection program done, and was starting to collect data, when I decided I should redo it with triples (of which there are 35,937). Then the length of the data collection process I was looking at became really daunting, and I lost interest in the project.<p>What I'd quite like to do, though, would be to crowdsource the data collection using a web app. Then I could get good three-key data and not have it biased to my own personal quirks.",1351439305

4709181,comment,4706678,4709102,3,0,protomyth,,,"It does seem odd, but my explanation is the ""I know I'm moving"" problem.  If you have mandatory rotations[1], then optimizing for a better next jump is just smart behavior.  You know you're leaving so optimize for ""flashy"" improvements and curry favor with superiors.  Its the known deadline that's the problem.<p>That being said, people should move on at some point.  The US Navy before and after WWII rotated out its officers to Washington DC.  It made sure operational experience was put into policy.  Bringing someone home to teach is a smart move.<p>[1] a typical IT strategy for managers doing the rotation to ""learn new areas"" is to cut Q&A people.

They also have native support for things like cohort analysis and customer lifetime value (which saves a TON of time in Excel).  In addition to the dashboards they provide (that a non-technical person can change and improve) they also have regular automated emails that help you and the team feel the rhythm of your business.<p>Basically: unless you are ready to devote a team of BI analysts to your product, RJMetrics gets you 95% of what you need with 5% of the effort of rolling something on your own.

It needs massive amounts of sales and with the current strategy Surface is not going to get them.<p>Out of curiosity, why do you assume the Surface needs to sell in huge volumes? If every single Surface is sold at a profit, and the Surface division is even slightly profitable for Microsoft, I don't see why it matters if they sell 10,000 or 10,000,000 of them.<p>To me it seems like the genius part of what Microsoft is doing is that Windows RT and/or the Surface don't actually need to succeed in terms of market share. They just need be taken seriously for long enough to drive down prices of Intel's x86 chips, so that Windows tablets have a shot against ARM tablets long-term. As far as I can tell, that seems to be working already. (Intel Atom Z2760)<p>They also have a massive Enterprise business, most of which will probably upgrade to Windows 8 eventually, buying them quite a bit of time to watch this unfold. Not to mention Xbox, etc. And of course, on top of all that, there is still the chance that Windows RT will somehow be a hit.... which would be even better for Microsoft, because it would end their Intel pricing problems for good.<p>To me, this seems like a decent plan for a software company that until now has only been losing relevance and market share. Its a better plan than bleeding out cash selling super cheap hardware to gain market share (Amazons Kindle Fire), waiting too long to give up the dying cash cow as the market changes (RIM), focusing only on extremely high quality products while your company dies around you (Nokia), or killing off the consumer version of Office for no apparent reason (which is presumably profitable as-is).",1351437063

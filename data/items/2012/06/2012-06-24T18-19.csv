Basic search relevance is an incredibly important feature (seems obvious, right?) that Apple is failing to provide. And the App Store has been open for four years! Perhaps it's the weight of the iTunes Music Store legacy code that I presume the App Store leans on which prevents progress? As it stands, the App Store today is worse than the web before Google.",1340564397

You'll actually find people take you more seriously without it.<p>What I'm reacting to is this idea that things are the way they are and they can't change.  That the companies have the sole power to set the terms for what they do with data provided to them by their users.  And of course they don't.  It's an exchange, and if the users, as a group, want to ask to change those terms, they are completely withing their rights to do so.<p>There's nothing self-entitled or egotistical about that.

Angry birds doesn't look like it would be fun, but it's got a great engine and just as importantly it has challenging levels that clearly had a lot of thought put into each one.<p>When making a game with as much freedom as this, it's too easy to try to make the platform the game, rather than building a game on top of it.

4153937,comment,4152534,4153845,0,0,jiggy2011,,,"Most of this could be applied to any strategy game (C&C etc), for example being able to build efficiently and Micromanage.<p>I would say that games like TA/Sup Com would seem more ""strategical"" since they tend to be bigger in the sense that they have bigger maps and bigger , more complex tech trees. You also have more options in terms of setting up queues and automated behaviours for units (patrolling,ferrying etc) which means that you don't have to worry about revisiting your base as often because you have already queued up everything you want built for the next 5-10 minutes. It also allows options such as going into a resource deficit to produce units you cannot afford (but will be built more slowly).<p>I suppose this could be said to reduce the importance of the ""micromanagement"" aspects of the game (although these can still be important) but I'm not sure if this is necessarily a bad thing in itself. Professional SC looks to me more like it is being played on the basis of quick reflexes and drilling build orders quickly in a sense closer to an action game where you control a lot of units rather than ""strategy"" as such, perhaps tactics is a better word.<p>To me it would seem that as technology advances strategy games should become less about micromanagement, since in a real war the General does not usually micromanage the actions of individual soldiers on the scale of ""move left, now fire you gun"" etc. Of course a general may make high level decisions such as how to train their soldiers which will affect how they behave in the field etc and this could be simulated with AI.",1340564319

QE was certainly effective in raising the amount of reserves, since that is what it is by definition. But reserves are only ever held by banks. The amount of money held by the non-bank public has not been changed significantly by QE.<p>As for targeting the money supply, you're right, they could do that, and in fact they did try it a few decades ago. The problem that was observed is that it created extreme volatility in the interest rate. The lesson learned from the experiment is that either the interest rate or the money supply has to be volatile, and there's general consensus that a volatile interest rate hurts the economy, whereas a volatile money supply has marginal effects at best.",1340563943

If the purpose of the new ranking methodology was to place higher weight on downloads and less on name matching, then there's an unintended consequence of certain niche search terms getting crowded out by tangentially related popular apps.

Trivial for dynamically typed languages, but how do you handle the type of that key in a statically typed language? Mandate that the key be a string? Build a limited set of overloads against a dedicated type? And even then, how do you specify the relative constraints of the different values within that key, especially within the limitations of java's type system?<p>> The example given here - "".sorted((a, b) -> a.getValue() - b.getValue())"" - won't work properly when the calculation wraps around.<p>But that's less an issue of ""comparator functions [being] very easy to get wrong"" and more an issue of ""integer is an asinine type to use as ordering result"".

4153845,comment,4152534,4153763,12,0,codehotter,,,"I have played starcraft for ten years and reached a reasonable high level of skill. To be a good starcraft player, you need to be skilled in three broad areas<p>~~~<p>- Good mechanics and multitasking<p>This is your ability to have your units do what you want. You want unit X to go to place Y, you are quickly able to give that command, without taking up much of your attention. You're also able to simultaneously build units, advance your build at home, harass your opponent, reposition units, look at the minimap, and micromanage where necessary. Top players can have more than 5 actions per second average.<p>- Good micromanagement and tactical skill<p>For example, your ability to spread your units to take less damage from area of effect spells, focus fire on the most important enemy targets to get them down faster, your ability to position your units for flanking, to keep a scouting unit alive while being chased, etc. Maximizing the effectiveness of individual units.<p>- Good macromanagement and strategical skill<p>Your ability to advance your build at home correctly (what most effectively counters the opponent), to spend all your resources and not have it stack up in the bank, to choose the correct timings for expanding across the map or amassing an army, and to anticipate your army composition for what your opponent will do.<p>~~~<p>If you expect to be playing a game of chess, you'll be far behind even in the first few minutes. Your opponent's scouting unit micromanages and interrupts your build without your being able to kill even the scouting unit, and while your concentration is on the harassing unit, your opponent, who can multitask, executes his build perfectly.<p>Without a base level of competence mechanically (which in starcraft is about 2 effective actions per second) you cannot even compete strategically.<p>All three of these areas impress viewers which makes for a very 'spectatable' game.<p>Good mechanics and multitasking are evident when, after you've watched a battle, you can see how many more units the top player has been able to produce - while he was simultaneously micromanaging his units in battle.<p>Micromanagement, at least in starcraft, is very fun to watch. You can see the small army outmanoeuvre the larger enemy by individual control of units - it's hard to explain why it is impressive in just words, but the joy of watching good micromanagement is a core feature of spectating starcraft games. Watch for example here, how the player's marines dodges the spines while he keeps shooting.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQtPMLOctBg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQtPMLOctBg</a><p>Starcraft has a lot of 'soft counters' - units that counter other units but not completely. The focus on soft counters rather than hard counters gives players a lot of strategic freedom. Even if one player's units are countered, he can micromanage them and come out ahead. Or, for example, a player can take a risky early expansion to extra resources and rely on micromanagement of his few units to stay alive.<p>Finally, since the maps that people play on do change, it takes a while to find the optimal builds, so you do see a lot of really innovative strategic play that people love to watch. I really cannot give any examples on this without explaining many more details about the game. I am interested to hear why you think Total Annihilation would have more sophistication.<p>I must admit I haven't played many other games, but I have heard people complain that either the micromanagement or the multitasking aspect are not as much on the foreground in other games, and the combination of strategy + intense multitasking + micromanagement has kept starcraft exciting for both players and viewers.",1340562113

O'Dwyer's lawyers say he did so lawfully.<p>(6) Copyright is good, but it shouldn't be unlimited.<p>(7) Internet services are supposed to supply their operators with ""safe harbor"" protections.<p>(8) O'Dwyer's a clean-cut geeky kid who could start the next big Internet service.<p>(9) The case against him is thin, and his extradition is an outrage.<p>(10) There's a war between the Internet and content providers.<p>(11) O'Dwyer is the human face of that war.<p>Well, allow me to retort.<p>Richard O'Dwyer admitted to a UK Magistrate Court that he had been earning ""approximately 15,000 per month"" operating TVShack, a user-generated content site that provided a directory of downloadable videos. Of course, we're all adults here, and we know what those videos were. But don't take my word for it: O'Dwyer admits --- both to the court and (more notably) in the promo copy of his own site --- that the purpose of the site was to facilitate video piracy.<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the UK does in fact have criminal copyright infringement statutes. In both the US and the UK, what tends to get you charged <i>criminally</i> for infringement is building a business around that infringement. O'Dwyer was making something like a quarter million dollars a year from his business. The legal issues here are 1:1 between the US and the UK.<p>It probably didn't have to play out like this for O'Dwyer. Before he was charged, O'Dwyer had his domain seized. A cautiously enterprising commercial video pirate might take that as a signal to back off. O'Dwyer moved TVShack to a .cc domain, and put up a ""fuck the police"" banner on the site.<p>As Wales points out, in both the US and the UK, Internet services enjoy protections against the infringing activities of their users (the US calls these protections ""common carrier"" or ""safe harbor""; the UK calls them ""mere conduit"" protections). But copyfighter activists tend to cite these protections without explaining them. In particular: they leave out the fact that to qualify for these protections, you have to make what amounts to a good-faith effort to avoid infringing content on your site.<p>O'Dwyer appears to have done the opposite. Rather than studiously avoiding any knowledge of infringing content on his site, he ran promotional content on the site stating that TVShack was a great way to save money on first-run movies, by watching them on your computer rather than at the theater. UK magistrates assert that he selected links and posters to his site to maximize the number of popular movies that would appear. You can't maintain common carrier immunity simply by honoring takedown notices. Of course, you probably can't make a quarter million dollars a year from a simple list of links to videos while maintaining mere conduit protections, either.<p>Now, reasonable people can disagree that this amounts to a strong case for extradition. But agree or not, you should at least want the facts. Wales' plea carefully avoids providing those facts, instead pointing out how ""clean-cut, geeky kid"". But of course, you can describe virtually everyone ever accused of committing a crime on the Internet as ""clean-cut"" and ""geeky""; we're computer nerds. That's what we look like. It would seem to me more relevant to know that O'Dwyer was making a quarter mil a year flaunting copyright, grooming listings of first-run movies, and mocking law enforcement. Maybe that doesn't change your mind about the case. Maybe, despite the fact that O'Dwyer is accused of harming US companies and not UK ones, the fact that he did so at a desk in the UK leads you to believe he should be charged in the UK. Fine! But can we at least start by being honest about what happened?<p> <i>as I do so, keep in mind: I think Wales is wrong, and wrote this plea carelessly. If you disagree with me, you're going to find my breakdown objectionable; perhaps, reply with your own.</i><p> *Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988, Section 107, (2A)",1340561584

Monozygotic twins are from time to time quite discordant even in characteristics that are deemed ""highly heritable"" with reference to the experience of other twin pairs. The shuffle of genes that you or I receive from parents at the beginning of life does not determine our behavior, but simply establishes a biological substrate for the ""reaction surface"" that each of us present to our individual environments. Other factors that are properly called ""environmental,"" both at the societal and individual level of analysis, can and do overcome the odds influenced by individual genomes.",1340561097

As already anticipated in recent days, although the theory remains the same TDP, the Radeon HD 7970 GHz Edition will offer lower power consumption than the first version (proposed in 2011), thanks to a lower VCore.

12163,comment,11808,12160,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"Yup, that all makes sense.  I bet the San Francisco response depends a lot on whether or not you own a car.  My impression of San Franciscans is that none of them own cars, and don't want to drive, because my 3 or 4 Frisco friends are like that.  If most of your target market does own cars and is OK with a commute, then my hunch is totally wrong. ;-)",1176357365

12160,comment,11808,12089,0,0,startupstarter,,,"Hi Ryan,\n  First of all, sorry I didn't reply you in my previous YC post. I was going to but got sidetracked looking in the startup hub thing.<p>  Thank you for the advice.  To me Burlingame is not far at all from SF.  I was thinking I'm forgoing all the south bay people since it's quite a drive from down there.  But from SF, it isn't too far, especially when this location is right off the 101 freeway exit.  But more importantly, I was not really trying to suit everyone.  Actually, yes, I _was_ trying to suit most people at first.  But after not getting much replies, I figure I had to go a different route.  I figure that I may have to choose a location first, and then let them decide if that's what they want.   So I try to look at different locations available and imagine what I can do with the space.  Once I can imagine what I can do with it (how I can setup and divide up the space), I let everyone know about it.  Those who happen to be close to that location will be ""lucky"".  Those who aren't will have to decide whether they want to make the commute or try to setup carpooling or forget about it.  So if this location doesn't work out (still not too much response so far), I'll see what the next location brings.  That may be in SF or further south.  Hope you get a better idea of what I'm trying to do here.<p>oh, yes, this Burlingame location is right between 2 Bart stations, but I won't call them close by since it's like 1 mile away from each station.<p>thanks again for the reply,\njohn",1176355784

If that is the ""actual"" business objective, as opposed to the publicly stated one, then FREE is a business model because it allows them to grow more quickly.<p>On a personal note, I don't think this is sustainable or smart for the long run.",1176354349

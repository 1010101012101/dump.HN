2544126,comment,2543977,2543977,1,0,jrockway,,,"Also according to the Internet, ""you"" is spelled ""u"".  Everyone should adjust their internal dictionaries so that u don't become an establishment sellout.<p>Personally, it makes sense for ""scare quotes"" to not contain punctuation, as they are not complete sentences.  But it doesn't make sense for direct quotes to not contain punctuation, as in `He said, ""Hello there"".'  He didn't say ""Hello there"", he said ""Hello there.""<p>(It might seem logical to have two periods in that case, but it's ugly, so the second one can just be omitted for maximum conciseness.  That's why the period goes inside the quotation marks.  Similarly, it would be confusing and ugly to pretend to end a sentence in the middle of a sentence, so quotes that are not at the end of the sentence ""end"" with a comma.  The period is a pretty strong message to pause, and you don't want to overuse it.<p>IMO.)",1305280751

It's not the memory leaks in _my_ code I'm so worried about, it's the ones in other people's code :-) e.g. Doctrine used to leak like a sieve and no amount of free()s and unset()s cleared the ORM objects up under some circumstances. Long-running Symfony tasks were a great way to illustrate that. It seems like a sensible approach to auto-restart the processes once memory_limit is exceeded.",1305280407

If you're doing a bunch of _computation_ in threads, they are only affected in a very small way. If you're doing IO, it <i>can</i> have a very noticeable effect on some workloads. However, if you've followed any of my previous rants on why you should avoid threads as an IO primitive, you'll notice that performance and the GIL are but a footnote. I don't mean to downplay NewGIL, it's an interesting piece of software engineering. Just please don't see it as the panacea that magically fixed threads, because it isn't.<p>2) In the opening slide: ""do this if completely new"" translates to me as ""don't do this"". You're already using Python, which is a massive layer of abstraction in so many ways. Everyone using Python appreciates this as mostly a good thing, I would assume. So yes -- if no 2.x-only libraries exist that make your life easier and/or you're not willing to spend time porting them, go for it. I have just never found that to be true.",1305280361
2544111,comment,2543802,2543802,6,0,timdown,,,"This release is a fudge, and a partial backwards step. The jQuery team seem uncertain about what the prop()/attr() change is trying to achieve (an uncertainty that probably stems from the uncertainty underlying the whole attr() method in the first place). The result is that the situation is even more confusing than ever, judging by the release notes: a list of properties for which you can only use prop() and then a recommendation that for everything else you should use attr(). Really?? Then what the hell was the point of this change? Having gone as far as acknowledging that properties are not attributes and supposedly separating how they are dealt with, they then continue to recommend using attr() even though properties are almost always what you actually want and there is now a dedicated prop() method for dealing with them? I'm now genuinely baffled as to what this change was supposed to achieve, and average jQuery users are going to be seriously confused by the messages coming from jQuery on this.",1305280269

2544108,comment,2539788,2542414,2,0,roel_v,,,"Oh no it doesn't, if anything it just makes that I have been confronted with and thought about the orthogonality between 'legal' and 'moral' more than 'average' (I hate to use this phrase because it makes it sound like I'm arguing from authority there - I'm not) and I am highly aware of the difference. The reason I didn't respond to the post above saying a similar thing is that it's very boring to discuss personal opinions and circumstances that lead to them; and if personal opinions of certain people <i>are</i> interesting, I'm not one of those people. Rest assured though that I do not conflate the two, nor derive one from the other.<p>The matter is that morality is based on a small set of axioms - personal sovereignty, strong property rights, and the moral binding power of contracts (not in the legal sense - in the sense that if two people agree to something, they are morally bound to following through on those commitments). Intellectual property is just as much property as physical property is; without going into too much detail here, it quite naturally follows from more traditional, physical property ideas like Locke's labor theory. To simplify (so disregarding subordinate issues like ownership of ownership of base products, work-for-hire etc), when a person puts his efforts into creating something, he <i>owns</i> it, regardless if that what he creates is physical or not. It's painfully obvious and intuitive; if not (to use a very crude argument), then why does CC with attribution even exist? Most everybody instinctively recognizes this concept, and no sophistic constructs about maximum social utility or information as an oppression mechanism (<i>cough</i> crazy man Stallman <i>cough</i>) can do away with that.<p>Anyway, I'm not saying intellectual property and 'regular' property rights should be treated the same under the law; there are valid technical and conceptual reasons to separate them. That's not the issue I contend; what I contend is the pervasive cognitive dissonance in the 'geek' community (of which, to be clear, I am part) that somehow they should have the right to download whatever they want because there is at the moment no effective way for creators to enforce their will on what happens to their creations.",1305280157

Garbage collection in 5.3 helps a bit, but in general AiP exposes such issues more readily than regular mod_php setups. This doesn't mean memory leaks in your code wouldn't be an issue anyway, it just means you'll notice them a lot more quickly.<p>AiP workers die when PHP's memory_limit is exceeeded, and AiP will then restart them.",1305277696

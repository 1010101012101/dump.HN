But not just targeting them on price, targeting the features of their site that keep people there for 30 minutes every day. This means that Facebook has to spend money to ""improve"". Again, compare this to outdoor advertising where the competition is largely just a matter of bidding on space every so often.<p>I, like you, have no idea what Facebook is worth or how successful their business model will turn out to be.

4016870,comment,4016658,4016658,3,0,jriediger,,,"I think a lot of the analyses of Facebook's advertising model miss one important point. Sure, their CTRs are not even closely comparable to Google's numbers. However, when people search on Google, they're often actively looking for certain products that lead to high CTRs on these targeted ads. In Facebook's case, people want to socialize and generally don't want to be disturbed by ads.<p>Basically, Facebook currently uses an advertisement model that is not very natural to its product (and not very well targeted for a number of reasons). But Facebook just doesn't care at this point, because they still generate sufficient revenue through the sheer number of users.<p>So the real question is whether Facebook can come up with an advertising model that is truly natural to its product (e.g. actual product recommendations by friends in conversations etc.). To conclude that Facebook is doomed to fail because their advertising model is suboptimal seems to be a little premature.",1337835165

Whether its design, UI, features, or some other mix, you want pick an area and fight for it. Losing in other areas is OK but the main focus is winning in your area and winning big.<p>If your issue is getting noticed, your strategy will be slightly different. It's no longer an issue of competition but one of customers not knowing about you product or service. In this case, I suggest reaching out to blogs, forums, and experts in the field.

On one hand a lot of unauthorized content gets posted and people get frustrated because their original content is ripped/duplicated (with other people sometimes taking credit!), but on the other hand, the ease with which people can post stuff also leads to greater exposure.<p>Any extra steps to post content can mean the difference between something going viral and something remaining unseen in the dark corners of the Internet. I don't know if this is a good comparison, but this reminds me of the piracy study[1] that said piracy was beneficial for sales. These lists are a way of ""pirating""/distributing content, though it seems without any real gain to the original creator due to lack of attribution (that's where the comparison definitely breaks down). I suppose the two would be more similar if you could somehow watermark the content to somehow point it back at the creator<p>Obviously, this method is really annoying for a lot of us, but the fact that it works so well and is generating all that traffic, likens it to all that Viagra spam we get -- people keep clicking!

I think this is a huge issue that's not discussed enough.<p>Facebook has all the data but no real targeting. This stems from two core issues: 1) they don't seem to use their immense datasets as effectively as Google does and most importantly 2) they rely on the advertisers to target their ads. Advertisers, even when handed the best demographic tools in the world, seem to get it horrifically wrong. This means people are exposed to bad advertising and learn to ignore it. This also means that advertisers will complain that Facebook doesn't give them the bang for the buck that they're after. Facebook don't mind however -- they still get their revenue.<p>In the long run Facebook need to work out how to target ads. The longer they leave these horrible ads in place the more desensitized their userbase will become. They're poisoning their revenue stream by allowing any and all ads through, regardless of quality or accuracy in the target market.",1337832641

You can see it here:<p>http://aliyabhatia.posterous.com/private/tunrgdjyaI#!/slideshow<p>All of which is great except it's really better to have a resident expert on board. We'd love that to be you. Send us a portfolio or a resume or a cover letter or some combination.

6474603,comment,6469485,6470886,2,0,rdl,,,"That ship sailed with CALEA.  It&#x27;s going to be relatively straightforward for the government in secret court to argue for an expansive reading of CALEA with respect to other authorized missions, and thus require individual VPN, email, etc. providers to comply with the same &quot;lawful intercept&quot; requirements as CALEA, I fear.  It won&#x27;t be a blanket thing like CALEA is for voice PSTN, but individual orders with respect to providers of interest (due to size, or like paltalk or lavabit, clientele), not very difficult.<p>IANAL, though.",1380610769
6474602,comment,6473983,6474214,2,0,robomartin,,,"Read my prior post on this for support of my assertion.<p>As to what I have done vs. Obama.  Well, first of all, neither you or I should be the scale by which a President is measured.  A President ought to be better than most of us in areas relevant to running a country, an economy.<p>You are an educated man.  I presume you studied logic and know full well that shooting the messenger does not refute what the messenger might be claiming.  I&#x27;ll give you the benefit of the doubt and suggest you might want to run through the exercise I suggested in an early post in response to similar criticism [1].  I would be very interested in your reasoning showing how 2008 Obama was qualified to become CEO of a non-trivial enterprise, particularly when compared to seasoned and tested C-level executives.<p>I am not going to engage in a &quot;what have you done?&quot; conversation.  I&#x27;ll simply say that I have been an entrepreneur my entire life.  I have started businesses, employed people from varied disciplines and backgrounds  --including software engineers like you.  I have succeeded and failed.  I have been bankrupt.  More than once.  And I have pulled myself up and out of such circumstances through hard work, dedication and a healthy dose of risk taking.  My life, for better or worst, has given me a unique perspective.  And, while I freely admit that I am far from infallible I really don&#x27;t think I am wrong on this one.  There&#x27;s nothing in Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 history that even approaches the development of an understanding of how a non-trivial business operates, much less an entire economy of this scale.<p>A sailing analogy is apt here.  As a long time sailor I can tell you that anyone can sail under typical benign Sunday-Sailor conditions.  There are two conditions that separate the hobby sailor from those who really know what they are doing:  the extremes.  It takes a lot more work to sail a boat when there&#x27;s very little wind and you need to waste nothing in order to move.  It also takes a lot of experience and knowledge to sail a boat under heavy winds and dangerous swells.  Neither of those conditions are suitable for someone who has no experience whatsoever at the helm.  One does not give you enough feedback.  The other could kill you and your passengers if you need to learn on the job.  You want to hire an experienced skipper, particularly for the second scenario.  A Sunday-Sailor is likely to get you killed.  That&#x27;s  as close as I can get to explaining who we gave our country to in 2008 (and, arguably, in 2012).<p>Our government has been steadily and systematically destroying our country from the inside for the last fifty years.  It is hard for me to imagine a way to refute this.  Shoot the messenger if you must, but he message stands on it&#x27;s own.  Regardless of who I am.<p>Yet I am nobody.  I&#x27;m just a bunch of words you read on this screen.  Read them.  Decide for yourself.  The irony of all of this is that regardless what you or I say we will both have to live with the reality our government is creating.  I can&#x27;t possibly imagine anyone with a reasonable degree of intelligence and education thinking that this reality is one headed towards anything other than a disaster.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6474544"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6474544</a>",1380610743

Happy to hear about the suffering and what we could do better there.<p>We have actually spent a lot of time trying to reduce the pain and suffering from CI. Of course, you can&#x27;t please everybody: trying to do that gets you Jenkins. Rather, we try to make a wonderful experience for web apps running on Linux.<p>Some examples of this: scaling your CI to run more than one build at the same time is tough on Jenkins, trivial on Circle. Same with splitting long builds over multiple machines. Doing either of these on jenkins is a massive pain, and most of our converts from jenkins come over at that point in trying to scale it.<p>Another example is that many projects will just work out of the box, with no configuration: Ruby, node and python projects in particular (also Go, scala and clojure and a subset of Java projects). But when you do need to configure, we allow you configure a very large amount. How does that differ from jenkins? Well, we try to make that configuration as simple as possible, while still providing you with as much power as you need. See some detail in <a href=""https://circleci.com/docs/configuration"" rel=""nofollow"">https://circleci.com/docs/configuration</a><p>Lastly, in terms of preventing suffering, we have some really cool features around debugging, such as being able to SSH into our build VMs, and fantastic customer service, manned by engineers (my day is Monday, feel free to say hi: sayhi [at] circleci.com).",1380610054

Do this.<p>Go to Monster.com or the appropriate job board.<p>Find a job description for a CEO of a non-trivial business.  Say, a manufacturing operation with thousands of employees, international reach, a complex supply chain and a well developed channel of distribution.<p>Now go back and find Obama&#x27;s resume from 2008.<p>Objectively look at it and compare it to the resume of seasoned C-level executives who might apply for such a position. You can use LinkedIn for this purpose, find people who you think might be qualified for the job and, therefore, could be interested in applying.<p>I hope your conclusion will be that Obama was, in no way, qualified for such a job.  Not even close.  He had been on the job as Senator for two years and was a law professor before that.  There seems to be nothing whatsoever in his life experience that could even remotely paint him as qualified to take on such responsibility.<p>His resume would go in the trash bin instantly and a polite email dispatched to inform him that he is not being considered.  I could see HR going &quot;Why is a law professor applying to run a business when he knows absolutely nothing about running any kind of a business and has no relevant experience?&quot;.<p>My statement is, without a doubt, factually correct.  Perhaps it offends you. However, that does nothing towards altering it&#x27;s veracity.  In fact, it can easily expanded to declare that it would have been unlikely for him to have been qualified for C-level leadership positions at any non-trivial business.  He simply wasn&#x27;t qualified.<p>Yet, we gave him the largest economy in the world to run.  During the first two years he could have done whatever he wanted.  He had the House and the Senate.  Any half-way-decent business person would have had a laser-like focus on the economy, jobs, reducing spending and facilitating economic activity.  Not him.  He didn&#x27;t have a clue.  He focused on anything but the many elephants in the room.  That&#x27;s a matter of record (and the lack of results). And here we are.<p>Want more proof?  Remember what he said about the National Debt as a Senator?  Don&#x27;t remember?  Here, I&#x27;ll help you:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kuTG19Cu_Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kuTG19Cu_Q</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fUmFBMVWNI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fUmFBMVWNI</a><p>And now we are at $17 trillion and he wants MORE!<p>And we have no budget.<p>And every bill being passed is chock-full of earmarks and back-end deals that would sicken most.<p>On top of what I said regarding his qualifications, he also happens to be a hypocrite and a liar.  I&#x27;ll leave it up to you to go back and review video records of the things he promised and compare them to what he&#x27;s actually done.<p>When every union in the country is screaming bloody murder about Obamacare you know you have problems.<p>That said, this isn&#x27;t about Obama and Obamacare.  This is about the branches of our government having plunged us into a very dangerous position over the last, say, fifty years.  Again, party affiliation isn&#x27;t relevant here.  These people are making bad decisions on both sides of the isle.<p>Regardless of whether you agree with me or not the fact remains that our kids are going to inherit a disaster of nearly unimaginable proportions.  Perhaps you are OK with that and choose to look the other way due to party or other loyalties.  Thou shalt not speak ill of our tribe!  Or some such thing.  Well, that&#x27;s cool.  I admire your loyalty.  However, the one important detail is:  This does not change where we are headed.<p>What&#x27;s your limit for the national debt?<p>When do you say &quot;enough!&quot;?<p>We are at $17 trillion right now [1] (well, just shy).  That means each tax payer would have to pay nearly $150,000 [1] in order to pay off our debt today.  You and I are not paying it off any time soon.  And, if we continue along this path even our children will not be able to pay it off.<p>How much is enough?<p>Senator Obama said adding $4 trillion to the national debt was &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;unpatriotic&quot;, his words, not mine.  He was right.  What, then, is adding another ELEVEN TRILLION [3] by the time he leaves office?  He is on track to more than double the national debt with respect to what it was when he took office.<p>At what point are you willing to proclaim that our government is fiscally inept, irresponsible and, yes, unpatriotic?<p>Do you understand how important it is to bring things back to a more reasonable state?  Surely you do.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not researching this at least to an extent where he or she can understand the numbers and their consequences.  A couple of hours of Excel work and your jaw should be on the floor.  And you should be angry too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.usdebtclock.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usdebtclock.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kuTG19Cu_Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kuTG19Cu_Q</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.usdebtclock.org/current-rates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usdebtclock.org/current-rates.html</a>",1380609850

The answers I read to questions like this normally strike me as very tautological. Things like &quot;you need your team to be well oiled and to have very specific goals&quot;. It&#x27;s not that that&#x27;s false, it&#x27;s just that we normally judge a team&#x27;s well oiledness by how quickly it releases nice things. So I&#x27;m going to jump over that, our team is plenty well oiled and getting better all the time but let me tell you how I think we got there.<p>For us the secret was getting in repetitions. We started by building and releasing one thing we were really proud of, our process for doing it was adhoc and broke down in a million places but we slogged through. Then it came time to build the next version, this time we did some things better and a lot of things we didn&#x27;t do better. This was our 10th major release by now it feels like we&#x27;re doing a lot of things better. The most satisfying thing about it is that it&#x27;s not totally clear to any one of us where all the inefficiencies went the knowledge of how to release quickly isn&#x27;t stored in any single brain.<p>One thing I think is an absolutely crucial aspect of this process is making it discreet. During a release cycle I take our release process as absolute. I try as hard as I can not to even think about ways to fix it. Between release cycles I step back and look for ways to tweak the process and ignore 1st order feature development. I&#x27;m not sure what it is that makes a discreet process work better, it might just be that it frees up mental bandwidth, but if you find yourself getting bogged down in the process of releasing rather than actually releasing while you&#x27;re trying to develop the product to release try shutting off half the equation. It&#x27;s helped me a lot.<p>Also another way to solve this is to have separate people focus on each aspect. That can be tough at smaller companies because so much communication needs to happen between the 2 but it certainly can work.",1380607361

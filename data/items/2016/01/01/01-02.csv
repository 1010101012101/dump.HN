You won&#x27;t get a one-size fits all solution, as it totally depends on 1) the industry you&#x27;re working in, 2) the internal compliance policies you have to deal with, 3) the country you&#x27;re operating in, 4) the operating policies you have to follow in order to stay compliant with the clients professional liability insurance policy/policies.<p>>> &quot;lots change as you try to build a complete system&quot;\nI mean this is why in the enterprise, changing one line of code can take 2 weeks of conference calls (in-house legal often has to be brought in, the original stakeholder of the project has to be brought in and odds are he&#x27;s gone so whoever inherited the project has to be brought in, if you&#x27;re making a fundamental change to the system often third-party auditors from the big 4 are requested to sign-off on the logistics of the change (especially if you&#x27;re a publically traded company operating within the US).<p>RE: Purchase ordering systems - this has been standardized via multiple standards, but most of the companies I&#x27;ve consulted with have one integrated system (usually SAP, Dynamics, or one of the other handful of big-name brands), and they all speak the EDI standard[1], or if not, you&#x27;ll certainly have Connector modules. I.e., BizTalk (if you&#x27;re on a MS Dynamics stack, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll be using for workflow) has a SAP connector, SAP has a connector for Epicor, etc. With respect to security in terms of server<->server PO negotiation, read this[2] if you&#x27;re on the MS stack. SAP R/3,4 (and B1, and AIO) all take care of the issuing of the PO, validating incoming POs (i.e., the SAP FSCM module will take care of customer management to see if the credit line is available for the customer, and all that; the FI/CO stuff will take care of balancing the accounting journals); the workflows [defined within BizTalk for MS or using custom ABAP modules that were placed in during your SAP implementation], the security negotiation is usually done via AS2 (see: [2]) or through one of a few 3rd party EDI transaction entities (in the same way that there are like 4 major CC companies, like-so with those EDI value-added transactors). x.509 and ActiveDirectory are almost always the standard re: authentication[3]<p>CRM&#x27;s are historically purchased as a module that plugs into your ERP.<p><i>Lemur and Let&#x27;s Encrypt have _nothing_ to do with anything enterprise and belong nowhere near it.</i> (The fact that you even posed this question makes me really concerned) LE is great for the average Joe developer because it democratized SSL cert generation, but even if a VeriSign SSL is 100$ that&#x27;s, what? half an hour of a consultants time? My clients get that warm feeling every time they see a brand-name as a line-item on their invoice. <i>Managers are all about mitigating risk.</i> This is why you have VMware instances running 30 year old software simulating DEC Alphas, and why consultants who have skillsets in REXX and JCL can bill higher than associates in BigLaw. <i>Any project has risk attached to it, an integration/re-write project has avoidable risk. Delegate the risk factor out by getting the CIO to sign off on a restructuring program that&#x27;s done by consultants so if it fails you can blame Accenture or IBM Consulting.</i> I would never, ever take on a project like that, even at triple my rate, because it sounds like you&#x27;re already entrenched in a fractured system and in my experience those projects fail. I never take any work that I&#x27;m 100% sure I can complete because one major mess up and my reputation is shot. And this is the type of integration I do for a living.

For example, a require() call has a very (computationally) simple algorithm.<p>I certainly agree that your suggestion simplifies file-system layouts. The tradeoff is that the complexity shifts to other parts of the system.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not a fan of the v3 approach. I&#x27;d have preferred a central package cache with a structure similar to your suggestion. I&#x27;d add that each package in the cache should have all of its dependencies resolved in its own /node_modules/ dir with symlinks. Unfortunately, I still can&#x27;t see a nice way to handle peer dependencies.

All it takes is for one engineer or even a product person... Heck a technically-minded support person could listen in on the war room meetings and get enough information to post something better than &quot;we&#x27;re fixing it&quot;.<p>5 minutes of blogging every six hours would be plenty.<p>And yet, people always claim it&#x27;s impossible and there&#x27;s no time. Frankly I find it frightening... If you are coding that fast that no one on your team has five minutes to step aside, take a breather after six hours of coding and summarize what the team just spent the last six hours doing, I shudder to think what kind of panicked alarmist interventions you are making.<p>There&#x27;s no excuse for silence. There just isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a gross failure on the part of management to prioritize the responsibilities they have to your customers customers. Full stop. Sure, the engineers can&#x27;t be expected to remember to tap out to blog. But if that&#x27;s the extent of the accountability structures you can assemble during a crisis, that is a serious organizational failing, particularly for an organization the size of Linode.",1451613391

So I think that&#x27;s what people are referring to when they say that Node.js is an unproductive ecosystem.

Thank you for finding this pattern and telling about it clearly.<p>> The answer is to keep all volunteers equal.<p>(Un)Fortunately this would break.  Logically, how can you have one group of equals enforce their rules with unequal power?  Naturally, influence (roles(?)) emerge(s).  For social animals to want to stick together over the long haul, (1) an elder&#x27;s view needs to carry a good bit of weight.  This makes it possible to retain experience and membership, because these elders are our gateway to the past and they get tired and battle worn.  The young learn from those with the experience and use it to build their future.  (2)  Members need to both use influence and limit it.  Mocking leaders and their work, behind their backs and in-front of them, joking with them over the flaws in their work help them to keep their heads from filling with hot air.  When someone takes on more responsibility, people will naturally and comfortably give them uneven support if they mutually respect and believe in eachother.  This means some have more influence than others.  When this flowing power gets a kink in it and builds up in any one place, then it will flood the basin.  As long as work gets done and individuals cultivate good relationships, then a community will stick together and most everyone will feel like the community has good balance.<p>My experience with this: studied this a bit within anthropology and sociology, lived with these dynamics in and among Drupal (a self-described do-ocracy, perhaps a holocracy) community members for over ~10 years, and have a deep interest in natural processes that contribute to social order.<p>A related snippet from you guessed it with several links to springboard into related research:<p><i>Anthropologists maintain that hunter/gatherers don&#x27;t have permanent leaders; instead, the person taking the initiative at any one time depends on the task being performed.[13][14][15] In addition to social and economic equality in hunter-gatherer societies, there is often, though not always, sexual parity as well.[13] Hunter-gatherers are often grouped together based on kinship and band (or tribe) membership.[16] Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers tends to be matrilocal, at least initially.[17]</i><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer#Social_and_economic_structure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer#Social_and_eco...</a>",1451611935

Isn&#x27;t it a huge pain to whitelist scripts? Isn&#x27;t everything broken?&quot;<p>Nope. Most of the web works <i>perfectly fine</i> without loading Javascript from 35 different domains (as my local news site does). You whitelist a few webapps and you&#x27;re pretty much good to go. The difference is incredible. Your browser uses a fraction of the memory. Pages load faster than you can blink. The browser never catches up or lags. Pages scroll as you expect. Audio and video never autoplay and distract you. When I briefly used NoScript on mobile, it was a miraculous life-saver that made my battery live forever.<p>In the past couple years, however, I have noticed a new phenomenon. Remarkably - madly, in my view - there are webpages, webpages that should be <i>simple</i>, webpages by all appearances that consist of nothing more than a photo (maybe more than one), a byline, and a few hundred words of text, that <i>require Javascript to load</i>. As in, you will get a a blank page or an error message if you don&#x27;t have their scripts enabled.<p>I don&#x27;t understand it. I don&#x27;t want to understand it. I just want it to stop.<p>I understand that you need Javascript and so forth to run a webapp. I&#x27;m not even asking for your webapp to be less than 5MB. Hell, make it 50MB (I just won&#x27;t ever use it on mobile.) Making applications can be a lot of work, maybe yours is super complicated and requires tons of libraries or some crazy media loading in the background and autoplaying videos and god knows what else.<p>But please, please, <i>don&#x27;t</i> require Javascript to simply <i>load</i> an article and don&#x27;t make a simple article 5MB. Why on Earth would you do that? How many things have to go wrong for that to happen? Who is writing these frameworks and the pages that use them?",1451610566

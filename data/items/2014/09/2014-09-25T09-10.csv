That is not true. Swift is a pragmatic amalgam of features from many modern languages.<p>The issue here is that many of the ideas are not fully realized and stunted to work within the constraints for the language (such as seamless C/ObjC interop). This is what is causing generics to only be halfway there (and same with several other features). In generics, Swift aims for strictly typed, reified generics, but then leaves you only with very crude tools to create them with. Generics in Swift is an exercise in frustration.

8366313,comment,8363527,8364303,1,0,trhway,,,">is there a plausible bridge between the impossibility of this kind of collapse and complete impossibility of black holes?<p>the shown impossibility of star collapse to BH is somewhat questionable for massive stars because - as i cited wikipedia in another comment - the Hawking radiation carries away less mass/energy than cosmic background brings in - the net is positive for the collapsing star.<p>>smashing dense cold chunks, would those necessarily radiate enough energy to prevent collapse too?<p>we associate &quot;collapse/smashing&quot; with BH i think mostly because of collapsing stars. One can scale this process out to a lot of small chunks of cold matter as you suggest flying simultaneously toward common center. Imagine the sphere with radius 1000 times radius of Sun filled with material of density of water - this is already a black hole as its Schwarzschild radius is a bit larger than those 1000 radii of Sun. Now lets say we scale the sphere radius additional  10 times - the mass scales 1000 times and the Schwarzschild radius increase 1000 times too - thus all this water may be separated by a lot of space and still be a black hole. Now imagine that all this water is outside the Schwarzschild radius and spread on some imaginary sphere and simultaneously released to fly toward the center - once all these drops cross the schwarzschild radius, even without touching each other, and with each drop feeling only pretty small gravitation from the rest of the water, they nevertheless become a BH. What kind of miracles would happen in the moment these drops cross the imaginary sphere of Schwarzschild radius? Nothing. The only change here is that any light radiated by the drops close to crossing would reach far observers as a very redshifted and any light radiated at the moment of crossing and after would never be seen by the far observers. The article suggests that the loss of mass due to Hawking radiation would be fast enough to shrink the Schwarzschild radius faster than the drops can fall into. All this cold drops flying in empty cold space would supposedly cause very intense radiation close to the schwarzschild radius border? Nope. As mentioned above in the wikipedia citation Hawking radiation is pretty cold, low intense, for that size of black hole, and in particular it is much colder than CMB, ie. the losses are less than what is brought in by CMB. Though may be in the absence of CMB if the math in the article is right the losses (given the time slowing) would be enough to shrink the Schwarzschild radius fast enough. Yet not in our real Universe with CMB.",1411636866

It&#x27;s not fancy, just works.<p>Facing Swift, I had mixed feelings. It&#x27;s a beautiful language, probably as pretty as Ruby, but what really makes it unique, or extremely productive? I can&#x27;t find any.<p>Am I the only one agrees with the author that generics probably do more harm than good. I&#x27;d argue that generic gives programmers a fake feeling of control and easily leads programmers spending time on over design.",1411636203

One frequent thing that black hats do is have all the boxes they root subscribe to e.g. an IRC channel, so that they can receive further commands.  The ratware (&quot;software written with nefarious purposes in mind&quot;) often comes pre-configured with options for blasting spam, hosting content on HTTP (for SEO or exploitative purposes), doing DOSes, and executing arbitrary commands against the local system.<p>One can, of course, envision numerous ways to get data in and out without it being an IRC channel, but that is easy to implement, works across a wide variety of target environments, and plays well with the existing ratware ecosystem.",1411636188

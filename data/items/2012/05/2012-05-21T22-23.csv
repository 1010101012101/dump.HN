4005330,comment,4005224,4005224,34,0,boredguy8,,,"There are more subtle ways of gaming ruining your life, as well: slowly losing the drive to do anything more than what's necessary to pay the cable bill, rent, and the gaming subscription. Slowly the only friends you have are people you know from your guild. When the only source & output of creativity and energy are all wrapped up in <i>playing</i> a video game.<p>I've also seen people similarly consumed by pornography, alcohol, gambling, day trading, and I'm sure other things I can't think of now. Pot. I think any of those things can have their place, but please maintain connection to people who can and will say something if you start going overboard.<p>For instance, I'm in a pretty good place right now and still gave parental control to a friend for the D3 release, just in case. Six hours a week is arguably still too much, but seems reasonable to me, and they won't budge because A) I asked them not to; B) they care. That I've hit that limit is a good sign that I may not be as well off as I thought I was ;)<p>Take care of each other, and yourself.",1337641152

4005328,comment,4003986,4003986,1,0,YmMot,,,"This is a cool idea, but I'm skeptical about it being worthwhile for the majority of people. There's absolutely no new ideas here, or anything that hasn't been done before. It's just a slightly novel combination of them.<p>The ""lights on the fretboard that show you what to play"" thing has been done; and while it generally gets good reviews I don't think it's revolutionizing learning guitar or anything. Likewise plugging into an iPhone for effects, etc.<p>The hardest part of starting guitar is simply building up your hand/finger muscles and muscle memory. Having lights on the fretboard makes it nominally easier to place your fingers, but reading tabs isn't hard to begin with (this is essentially just tabs on the fretboard anyway) and learning to look at a tab (or sheet music) on paper/a screen and translate that to finger positions is an important skill to develop as a musician.<p>This will encourage beginners to look at the fretboard when they play, which is a bad habit to get into.<p>I also have concerns about this feeling and responding like a real guitar. This doesn't operate like a normal guitar, so there will probably be a lot of little areas where it differs so someone who's played this may pick up a real guitar and find that they are making all sorts of horrible squeaking and finger noise, aren't used to the action of a real guitar, etc etc.<p>If it was a choice between this and a real guitar for a beginner, I would go with the real guitar no question. If you happen to have ~300-500$ that you can just blow on cool gizmos, sure it'd be fun to play with.<p>If you've never touched a guitar before, this might get you from 0 to ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" <i>slightly</i> faster than otherwise, but I doubt by much. I think the returns will diminish over time, and this might even ultimately hurt you.<p>The main neat thing is using it as a midi controller/ to make cool sounds but there are plenty of other options in that area already.",1337641091

Even cargo missions to ISS have become routine. The 'what' isn't the exciting part of SpaceX, the 'who' excites us. Most people probably don't get that.<p>What I can't understand is the disparraging nature of a lot of the coverage. Both Slate and the Wall Street Journal had really snarky commentary this morning about the delayed launch. There were many people poking fun at them on Twitter.<p>Meanwhile, as someone who actually follows this stuff, I was amazed by their ability to shut down the rocket after ignition without damage. I'm also impressed by the fact they're able to refire the engine almost immediately. You can't do that with every rocket ever made. Not only is the Merlin engine cheaper, it's better (than some). That's something to be proud of.<p>And even if the journalist doesn't know enough about rockets to be impressed that a failure didn't lead to the thing blowing up on the launch pad, they're acting as if government launches don't get delayed repeatedly. The Space Shuttle would seemingly only actually liftoff about 50% of the time they said it would. It's hardly a major set back that they pushed it back 48 hours. Why does it seem like people want this to fail?",1337640871

He always had a good heart and would do anything he could to help you out. It was certainly a shock.<p>Monday morning he didn't show up to work. He always calls or sends an email if he won't be in but nobody could get a hold of him. I got a bit worried since I knew he was playing Diablo 3 since it came out on Tuesday and I've heard of people dying from exhaustion and what not from playing video games so much. I didn't want to think that but it had occurred to me. Especially since nobody has heard from him since late Saturday. I had called his landlord and asked about him. (The landlord, Russ and I are all good friends and we've known each other for a while) I was heading over and she was going to let me in but apparently she got too worried and went in anyway. She found him at his computer. He apparently had a heart attack. Poor gal shouldn't have had to do that. I kick myself for not going there immediately. I had gone in anyway at the request of the Fire Department to find his identification and cellphone. Not a minute goes by that I wish my memory of him had not been sullied in that manner.<p>I sincerely hope that he went quickly and didn't suffer, unable to contact anyone for help.<p>He was only 32 years old.<p>Please, if only for yourselves, take time out of your day to get some exercise. Go outside and enjoy the sun. Ride a bike. Do something active. Video games are great fun when played in moderation. This may be an extreme example but take it as advice to not go overboard. Or at least don't do it alone. He took 3 days off and played Diablo 3 pretty much the whole time. He called in and asked to take Friday off as well. We are placing the blame on ourselves at work wondering if we made him come in on Friday would he still be with us today?<p>It saddens me that we tried to get him to be healthy. Work offered to pay for a gym membership. Friends coaxed him to exercise and eat better. He took us up on our offers, if only for a short while.<p>We should have tried harder.<p>He will be missed greatly by all who knew him.",1337640216

4005241,comment,4001727,4001727,5,0,wesbrown18,,,"I read your post, David, and I found it very akin to my experiences.  In a lot of ways, I am you -- but fast-forwarded fifteen years.  I am in the prime of my career now, considered to be one of the best in my rather specialized and intersecting fields of high performance computing and automated malware analysis; I am a Chief Architect of a startup company, engineering manager of a small crackerjack development team, and I am Deaf.<p>I empathize with the feeling of being the last to know things.  Unless it is written via email, IM, or directed at me personally, I do not know it.  I have found a company structure that mitigates that particular issue, in that I am part of and leading a remote engineering team.  There are no members of the team that share offices, so all communications and 'lunchroom conversations' actually happen over IM, the phone, or in the group chat room.<p>For a long time, I was just as isolated as you are -- for many years, I was the 'hacker in the corner' that you slid food to under the door, along with tasks to do.  I was a security consultant that was given targets to hack, and write reports.  But I did very little customer interaction, by intent and design.  I am old enough that text relay over a TTY was my only option.<p>I had a US Robotics modem attached to a Sun Sparcstation in my basement, that was BAUDOT capable.  I had GNU screen running, attached to that serial port, and sent the console up to my office.  In this way, I was able to answer and make calls from anywhere that I had a SSH connection, including my early text-only RIM Blackberry.<p>Text relay is awkward and horrible in a lot of ways, and I share your pain.  I can trace the turning point in my career when Video Relay Service started being offered over the Internet, along with the early model Sorenson videophones.  Because I was able to communicate fluidly via the interpreter, using voice-carry-over, when neccessary, my coworkers started to see me as more of a concrete person.<p>Because of the doors that Video Relay opened, versus text relay, I was able to emerge from my 'hacker in the corner' persona, and advance to become an extroverted and respected Principal Consultant who managed client engagements.<p>I have a pretty cool Tandberg/Cisco E20 Videophone on my desk with built in VCO.  It has a Bluetooth connection to my hearng aids, so when I dial a number, I get the audio shunted straight to my ears.  Further, with the built in VCO, there is no call complexity in voicing for myself.  I just pick up the handset, or speak at the screen in speakerphone mode.<p>When I speak, the other hearing people hear my voice.  When the hearing people speak, the sign language interpreter translates what they say; using the contextual and spatial nature of American Sign Language, the interpreter is also able to identify which speaker it is with a body shift.   Because there is very little latency versus transcibing, the conversation is natural and fluid.<p>Two times a week, as engineering manager, I lead the conference call where the engineering team gets together and gives status updates and issues.  I also handle client and customer calls that require a personal touch from an engineer.<p>Reading your post about your frustrations dealing with the phone, I do need to point out that the easiest path is to accomodate the interviewer or other people's request for a phone number.  All the services that offer telecommunications access for the deaf are required by the FCC to provide a real and personal number that anyone can dial.<p>This is the key factor here -- rather than trying to tell them to not use a phone, give them a phone number that is linked to the access service of your choice.  This includes CapTel, which is real time transcribing of phone conversations, by an operator that uses dictation.  <a href=""http://www.captel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.captel.com/</a><p>I know that you do not identify yourself as culturally Deaf, or as a fluent signer, but American Sign Language interpretation provided by a competent video relay service agency that is selective about its staff is far more fluid and latency free than captioned telephone.  The interpreter can even indicate in expression if he or she is unsure about the subject matter -- and more importantly, the interpreter can convey the tone of voice that the other person is using at the moment.  This is what has allowed me to be an effective consultant, being able to determine emotion, even by proxy.<p>As far as love, girls, dating, and marriage, I am married to a Deaf/HoH girl myself.  I keenly empathize with the frustration that is dating when you are deaf.  Dating is supposed to be a nice experience, where you figure out if you're compatible or not.  But if you are concentrating so intently on trying to understand the other person on a date, then how can you feel the chemistry or spark that is supposed to happen?<p>My first date with my eventual wife was a moment of grace, a breath of fresh air.  It was the first date that I've ever been on, that I laughed and felt comfortable at.  Yes, we were nervous, yes, there were some dialectal and communications difference, but I enjoyed myself and so did she.  One date and then another, and I moved to be closer to her, proposed, and married her.<p>We primarily sign in our household, because it is the communications method that is the most relaxing.  When we sign, we do not concentrate, or feel frustrated.  When we emerge into the world outside, it is not as terrible a chore to put on our hearing aids and concentrate intently on hearing people -- because we have our retreat and solititude.<p>You should not choose not to marry a d/Deaf/HoH girl based on how likely it is that you will have deaf or hearing children.  The majortiy of Children-of-Deaf-Adults I have met have felt themselves enriched by the experience of being a CODA, of being truly bilingual in a widely different form of communications.  They find much to laugh about, in the form of communications.  By being CODAs, they are enriched by bilingualism rather than crippled by sign.<p>I am not advocating against Cued Speech as a primary form of communications; as a matter of fact, when I think about it, Cued Speech has some advantages over sign language when it comes to hearing people.  It does not require them to learn an acutal language; it is easier to teach eight handshapes and eight locations around the face.  It is also easier to do Cued Speech and speech rather than simultaneously doing American Sign Language and English.  Cued Speech is a change of mode rather than a change of language.<p>The sad reality however is that there will probably never be any form of telecommunications access that used Cued Speech.  I would actually use a Cued Speech VRS service if it was available, as it does not require me to merge two linguistic streams in my brain, Spoken English and American Sign Language into a conversational model.  And the alternative, CapTel, doesn't have the same sideband communications capabilities or the reduced latency that American Sign Language interpretation offers.<p>In a nutshell, my message is, there are options to ease your path through life, including Captel, and VRS.  Do not exclude love based on deafness.<p>Let me know when you're done with Hacker School, and we can discuss whether a remote job with us might be a good fit for you.  We're doing some of the coolest stuff around over here, building a special-purpose supercomputing cluster.",1337639669

He always had a good heart and would do anything he could to help you out. It was certainly a shock.<p>Monday morning he didn't show up to work. He always calls or sends an email if he won't be in but nobody could get a hold of him. I got a bit worried since I knew he was playing Diablo 3 since it came out on Tuesday and I've heard of people dying from exhaustion and what not from playing video games so much. I didn't want to think that but it had occurred to me. Especially since nobody has heard from him since late Saturday. I had called his landlord and asked about him. (The landlord, Russ and I are all good friends and we've known each other for a while) I was heading over and she was going to let me in but apparently she got too worried and went in anyway. She found him at his computer. He apparently had a heart attack. Poor gal shouldn't have had to do that. I kick myself for not going there immediately. I had gone in anyway at the request of the Fire Department to find his identification and cellphone. Not a minute goes by that I wish my memory of him had not been sullied in that manner.<p>I sincerely hope that he went quickly and didn't suffer, unable to contact anyone for help.<p>He was only 32 years old.<p>Please, if only for yourselves, take time out of your day to get some exercise. Go outside and enjoy the sun. Ride a bike. Do something active. Video games are great fun when played in moderation. This may be an extreme example but take it as advice to not go overboard. Or at least don't do it alone. He took 3 days off and played Diablo 3 pretty much the whole time. He called in and asked to take Friday off as well. We are placing the blame on ourselves at work wondering if we made him come in on Friday would he still be with us today?<p>It saddens me that we tried to get him to be healthy.

This would only work for applications where you expected the median to only vary in a limited fashion, and only after the system had been ""primed"".<p>For example, at any point in time, only store 100-1000 samples in memory, tree'd into ""greater than median"" and ""less than median"", additionally in each side of the tree store the number of samples that are in that tree but were purged do to the samples in memory requirement.

4005199,comment,4002539,4002539,1,0,larrys,,,"One of the most important thing I learned when doing advertising is to not be a pioneer (as the saying goes ""they get shot in the back"".) Particularly in small business advertising.<p>If you see your competitors (or people will similar products or services) using a particular medium it's usually a good bet to at least try. But even if you try you have to give it a test of quite a bit of time (and that depends on the product and amount of profit as well and other factors).<p>A good example of this is ""back in the day"" yellow page advertising. If you look at what the YP called ""a developed"" heading (like Plumbers/Printers/Lawyers) you will see many ads year after year that vary in size including many full page ads. So that is a sign that's a good bet for advertising if that's your business. Especially when you find out the high cost. And I built an entire business based upon starting with a small ad in a developed heading in the yellow pages. Ad went in. Calls came in. (Expensive but worth it. Picked up a major account and did it for maybe 10 years until I sold the company). To me it made sense that if year after year small businesses were spending big dollars to be in the YP that was proof that it worked (and to mention again it did work extremely well for me). Of course when your competitors who don't advertise ask you you downplay totally the value and bitch and moan to throw them off the scent.<p>I would suspect FB works the same way. (In fact that was my experience using fb for a particular product but I can't say I gave it much of a chance though but take that as another data point).<p>I also had a similar experience with ""card decks"" those mailers that go out to businesses offering products and services. Worked very well. Sent out a card in multiple decks for a product that others offered and leads came back just like that.",1337638518

4005196,comment,4004900,4004900,5,0,Jun8,,,"Eugenics in this context is a bad example, because in this case controlled breeding definitely gets results, i.e. the theory (sort of) agrees with the theory, at least in the case of animals. You should thank such manipulative practices when you are enjoying a seedless banana.<p>Of course, the practice is abhorrent! But, and I think this is important, the ethical part has nothing to do with the science part. Consider the piece from NYT that reported Robert Spitzer's apology (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/health/dr-robert-l-spitzer-noted-psychiatrist-apologizes-for-study-on-gay-cure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/health/dr-robert-l-spitzer...</a>) for defining homosexuality as a ""disease"" and trying to cure it.

We fear the repercussions of this study, including an increase in suffering, prejudice, and discrimination, concluded a group of 15 researchers at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, where Dr. Spitzer was affiliated.""<p>I think that a scientific theory can we wrong or right (or currently undecided) but it cannot be morally wrong. The way you perform the experiments to test it may be morally wrong, though. There were significant faults with Spitzer's research, these should be pointed out rather than its moral wrongness.<p>Similarly eugenics should be attacked for its unintended consequences (e.g. extinction of Cavendish bananas <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/bananas.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/bananas.asp</a>) and its nineteenth-century simplistic approach to the human genetic-psychological relationship which, as we now, is vastly complex.",1337638468

A simple germanic ""house"" is not as grand as a french ""mansion"" or ""manor"".",1337637730

Pricing the IPO lower (as others have pointed out) would bring less money to facebook.

I used my iPad to move in the page and was a big experience, most of my initial design was not tested over visual appearance but semantic accessibility.<p>If you own an iOS device do activate VoiceOver and try to surf YOUR applications (and more important, your WEB applications).

If you want to listen to even 3 shows per week you could be looking at 4.5 to 5 hours worth of material. I would love to see 5by5 maybe splice up these shows into chapters or otherwise offer some time index that allows me to skip to the parts I'm actually interested in. I would have no problem with a pre/post-roll ad for each segment. There are a number of 5by5 shows I'd like to listen to but I just don't have 10-15 hours per week for it.",1337637605

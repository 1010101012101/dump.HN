Do you think a US hospital will keep you 4 nights for same surgery? I seriously doubt it. You most probably will be released few hours after the surgery or at most after overnight stay. Is the quality of care becomes lower because an Indian hospital kept a patient for 4 days instead of 1 day by US hospital? What does it say about relationship between quality of surgery and all these metrics such as duration of hospital stay, pain medication dosage and duration?<p>I found a lot of studies which used hospital stay duration and pain medication dosage and duration while in hospital as a proxy to quality of surgery but none that showed these metrics have anything to do with quality of surgery. Also, while quality of surgery takes into consideration the pain medication dosage and duration in the hospital, it ignores the pain medication dosage and duration patient was prescribed after being released from hospital. Similarly the overall healing and recovery time required by patient after the surgery is ignored in favor of the portion of recovery time patient spent in hospital. Hopefully, you see the incentive misalignment and mis-measurements.<p>You will get what you measure, nothing more nothing less. It is up to you to decide whether a measurement is relevant or not to what you trying to measure. You should not only worry about what a statistical study show but also what the study doesn&#x27;t show.",1450137479

An amount that an individual shouldn&#x27;t have in the first place. And this particular individual doesn&#x27;t have a particularly good track record.<p>1) For example, &#x27;investing&#x27; in education may boost the private education system at the further detriment of the public one - long term this could be worse for accessibility of the poor to good education. Zuckerberg does not have a track record of wanting to help public education in a way that includes stake holders like ... parents. Controlling an education system also allows indoctrinating people in convenient ways. I&#x27;d rather the public decides which propaganda our young generation&#x27;s minds get poisoned with rather than a billionaire with uncertain motivations.<p>2) For example, bringing the 1 billion poorest on the internet may involve giving them some sort of crippled Facebook+wikipedia-only access for free. This would create a great funnel to Facebook, in the name of charity, of course as a tax-deductible charitable donation, and would effectively make it harder for these people to access the real internet that can actually help solve problems for them. Because it&#x27;s tough to compete with free. Zuckerberg may end up destroying local companies trying to provide access to the internet. Just like direct food donations can undermine the local food production industry.<p>A young mother dedicating 99% of their life to charity is unlikely to have the potential for far-reaching negative consequences. And as you described that scenario, she is less likely to have motives about accumulating power, less likely to have a negative track record of mis-using power or misrepresenting intentions.",1450137404

The definition of a human level AI is it is able to do all the activities a human can do and so it can also make human level AIs too.<p>Once you have one human level AI you can make more replacing each human in the production of the human level AI - you basically start at the end point and working backwards replacing each job performed by a human with an AI. Once you get to the final job you will have a production system that can build AIs without any human labor. The system can make as many extra AI’s as wanted without any human labor - it is detached from the human labor market.<p>Unfortunately I don’t have any links discussing this. I think not too many people dwell on human level AI’s because the expectation is with AI’s if they can get to human level they will not stay at human level.

In an ideal world, this would not come Medicare, because Medicare is the least efficient funding source for - well, pretty much anything.<p>But the fact remains that residency programs are not a profit center for hospitals, and hospitals cannot absorb an extra $9.8 billion/year just to train residents. And there&#x27;s no other funding source for these programs at most hospitals that doesn&#x27;t ultimately make its way back to the patient in some form.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that the Balanced Budget Act capped Medicare&#x27;s funding for residency programs specifically to <i>reduce</i> the number of residency slots available and avoid an &quot;oversupply&quot; of doctors.

If the problem with the described medical practice is lack of efficiency and too much time spent in travel, perhaps Uber could make a system for multiple doctors which involves less travel time so long as patients didn&#x27;t require a specific provider. Also, Uber could take advantage of the fact that its drivers&#x27; time is significantly less valuable than the doctors&#x27; time and have them pick up supplies from the pharmacy so that when they pick up the doctor, all the supplies for the next appointment are already in the car and the doctor can head straight to the next appointment.<p>As with many things, scale matters and trying to be a solo provider of an Uber-like service is unlikely to work.",1450136948

The thing that I find attractive is that they engage three different engineering disciplines, electrical, mechanical, and software. However, that same diversity can often dissuade a student who is interested but becomes intimidated by the steep learning curve.<p>The other thing about robotics is that you really need a goal, otherwise people lose interest. The HBRC started the table top challenge which was good for a variety of reasons, 1) it was approachable, 2) it needed only a table top to work, and 3) it had enough complexity (in stages) to keep people challenged. DPRG created a number of challenges as well that were similarly staged.<p>So first ascertain which of the three disciplines they are most likely to be successful at. And start there. Parallax offers a number of good kits which are easy to program and the Makershed has the Arduino based robots.<p>Second come up with a goal, an objective that you seek to accomplish. Working toward that will give you the feeling of accomplishment you need to stay interested and feel like you are going somewhere.<p>Third, decide on your budget and set your scale appropriately. For low budget robotics you can build robots using converted servos for motors that roll around on tables, but for higher budgets you might want to build &quot;Magellen&quot; robots which can navigate around outdoors.

The term implies that philanthropy can be or is a mode of capitalism, whereas in reality it&#x27;s the opposite because philanthropy deals with altruistic allocation of resources rather than profit-seeking allocation of resources. Let&#x27;s not use this term, because it&#x27;s deceptive and doesn&#x27;t make sense internally.<p>Instead, let&#x27;s do some white hat thinking (purely facts, as little spin as possible) about Zuck&#x27;s new venture. Fact: Zuck has laid down a large chunk of change for a new project, and marketed this project to the public as large scale philanthropy. Fact: Zuck will get a large amount of leeway on taxes and oversight by moving his money in this way. Fact: some billionaires before Zuck have made similar moves that actually turned into fantastic philanthropic organizations that have made tangible positive impact in the world (Gates Foundation)-- but others have used the construct as purely a means to protect their money and get good PR.<p>These are some of the facts. I do not believe that there is any way to get around or reinterpret any of them without adding opinion, which probably snuck in anyway despite my efforts. At this point, I think that the reactions of those who question Zuck&#x27;s motives are justified because we haven&#x27;t had the time to see the program in action disbursing money as it claims that it will. A promise, a wad of cash, and a lot of PR do not make an effective philanthropic organization. Effective philanthropy requires that real, living people and real institutions are altered in an objectively positive way. The proper stance is skepticism and a request for more evidence of good will.<p>EDIT: I will add that the rabid detractors of Zuck have counterparts with the rabid pro-Zuck crowd... I doubt Zuck is looking out for anyone other than himself, but there is more to life than celebrity-watching, and it seems petty no matter how you slice it.",1450136294

If you play video games and/or watch Netflix, then a greater than 10mbps might make those things easier and thus more enjoyable, afaik.<p>I presently have a 1Mbps connection, which is consumed mostly by YouTube videos.  All my other internet usage could be satiated with 1/3 of my present bandwidth.<p>If I cared to watch Netflix or played video games, then I would be unhappy unless I had a substantially better connection, perhaps >10mbps.",1450134003

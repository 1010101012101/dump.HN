Ten years ago you could surf the web with 512MB of RAM; now we&#x27;re getting to the point where 4GB isn&#x27;t considered enough. If 4GB now costs the same as 512MB then, then in the sense of &quot;dollars worth of memory required to perform function X acceptably,&quot; memory hasn&#x27;t actually gotten any cheaper.<p>If you can get performance that used to require 4GB down into 1GB, you&#x27;ve upgraded the performance of a bunch of older and low-budget devices from &quot;barely usable&quot; to &quot;fine.&quot;<p>Take the big-picture view: updates like this can actually result in a slower flow of &quot;obsolete&quot; computers and devices into the landfills. This is one of those bottlenecks where a little good engineering can have really disproportionate positive aggregate effects.<p>This sort of thinking has been one of the selling points of desktop Linux for a long time.

If I misunderstand something, I apologise in advance for my inadequacies.<p>> ...attempts to invent a caricature of those you disagree with based upon age, despite that having literally nothing to do with the discussion in question...<p>By classifying my concerns as an &#x27;attempt to invent a caricature&#x27; are you trying to claim that the issue I am trying to raise does not exist?<p>Also, you seem to be reducing my entire opinion to just the age-ist point. So I went and re-read my post. Turns out there is an additional &#x27;since&#x27; in the line that changes the entire meaning of the paragraph:<p>> The ones that believe that ~~since~~ they have been writing software since the time that programs had to be punched on to cards and fed to a machine that was usually the size of three rooms, they believe that it gives them the right to look down upon any and all attempts by those who havent done the same.<p>This is clearly my fault and I should have been more careful. Age-ism isn&#x27;t the divide I am talking about in the post and not even remotely the point I am trying to make! Therefore, I propose the following changes to the offending paragraph:<p>> Their asshole-ry (can&#x27;t think of another word) comes from a self-belief so strong that you wonder if they have been writing software since the time it was fed to computers via punch-cards. Worse, their sense of entitlement is so strong that it leads them to believe that they have the divine right to look down upon any and all attempts by those who havent done the same.<p>> Your jeering criticism was nonsense, however, manufacturing a strawman that didn&#x27;t exist.<p>What strawman did I manufacture?<p>> People expressing frustration with the discussed submission, however, were making a very cogent point.<p>When did I reject the notion that the people expressing frustration weren&#x27;t making a cogent point? My entire opinion was based around the thought that they needed to be a little more positive/constructive with their criticism.<p>It seems we have differing opinions on what counts as positive/constructive and even on what counts as criticism itself, in which case, let&#x27;s just agree to disagree?",1380642581

The good institutions & traditions that we built over decades (or in this case, millennia) becoming obsolete, dying and taking all the side benefits with them.  Many lost their primary purpose, but they had so many important auxiliary purposes that I&#x27;m worried about losing them. For millennia, libraries stored knowledge and people went there to access it. All sorts of things naturally grew around this resource. Universities and their predecessors are one example but there are also small informal institutions. A group of friends meeting in a library because it is a a safe and quite place to do homework is an institution of sorts. A couple of homeless people using it as a safe place to hang out, read books and feel part of society is another example, especially if their interaction with others there is special in some way (it is).<p>There are lots of things like this.

And you&#x27;re thinking under the assumption these employees are on a mandatory vacation. That isn&#x27;t the case. They are all furloughed. Doing side projects and fun jobs doesn&#x27;t guarantee them any compensation. In fact, to get the money from the missded days is going to require another act of Congress to authorize backpay.<p>It&#x27;s a really shitty time to be a government employee.<p>[1]<a href=""http://smallbusiness.chron.com/labor-laws-volunteering-workplace-25747.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallbusiness.chron.com/labor-laws-volunteering-workp...</a>",1380639668

6476604,comment,6474876,6475504,2,0,johnchristopher,,,"Yes. In a nutshell:<p>- It was really expensive ;<p>- the merging destroyed what used to work well within both groups but didn&#x27;t produce a better group ;<p>- the old guard is still actively resisting changes in both groups ;<p>- a lot of discrepancies between level of powers (local, regional and national) that both groups weren&#x27;t seeing in the same way (they had a different who&#x27;s who to call for help when they needed to push things around and people lost some status or credit when trying to prevent it).<p>The main problem that should have been addressed (better coordination between both groups) still remains as far as citizens are concerned.<p>There was a clash of culture since the &quot;gendarmerie&quot; was more like military and police more like armed civil servants. Lines are being blurred now but there are still weird intermediate unofficial rankings that are in place only for legacy and &quot;don&#x27;t move my cheese and hurt my feelings&quot; reasons.<p>Salaries inequalities were too obvious and &quot;adapted&quot; responsibilities didn&#x27;t match people&#x27;s experience and training.<p>The overlap between the geographical regions each group were assigned to before the merging still transpires in the new system, like a ghost.<p>There was a huge power struggle.<p>I am sure these problems will totally disappear in a generation but it didn&#x27;t go anywhere as smooth as the politicians said it would. And the results isn&#x27;t necessarily better.<p>One thing hasn&#x27;t changed though: they still send officers from one linguistic region to the other when dealing with protestations motivated by hot and sensible topics.<p>There still are two different kind of police: the local one and the federal one. The local authorities hire officers while the federal one has an endless supply of new recruits* but every officers come from the same police academies.<p>* gross exaggeration here.<p>To be honest it&#x27;s not a problem of merging two groups or having only one police faction. It was badly handled and rushed by the political world at the time (they were in a hurry to fix many problems that were hot topic at that time, people were in the street and the merging was part of the answer). But I can&#x27;t see how such huge changes in a society could be made without the political world being under huge pressure to do so. So I can&#x27;t see how those kind of changes can&#x27;t be done without being rushed.<p>Keep in mind it&#x27;s only my advice and it was a sensible topic at some point. Some opinions are really polarized about all this.",1380639625

6476602,comment,6474933,6475929,3,0,snogglethorpe,,,"> The &quot;many tabs&quot; situation where Firefox performs better than Chrome is more like 50+ or 100+ tabs than 20.<p>For me it&#x27;s <i>much</i> sooner... on my work machine with limited memory, firefox is almost always noticeably better after 3-4 tabs, or even fewer when they&#x27;re memory-hungry sites like gmail.  With only 1GB on that machine, I tend to be hyper-sensitive to memory usage, and unfortunately chrome tends to basically use up all memory on the system once I reach 8-9 tabs.  FF gets a fair bit further.<p>The upside of chrome on that machine, however, is that the process-per-tab thing makes much easier to <i>control</i> memory usage: although tabs chew up memory quickly, closing a tab gives you back all the memory it was using, whereas with FF the relationship between closing tabs and giving memory back to the system is much fuzzier....",1380639617

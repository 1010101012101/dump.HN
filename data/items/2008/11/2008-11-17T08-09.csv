Not at Honda.""<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=366709"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=366709</a><p>From the article:<p>""Honda doesn't disclose executive pay in detail, but the sum of salaries and bonuses that Fukui shares with 36 board members, $13 million, is just about enough for the boss at a big American company.""<p>also:<p>""Honda has never had an unprofitable year.

You can view their 990 returns in a variety of places online like guidestar.org.<p>A ""non-profit"" mostly can't sell shares nor link pay to profits. Many can do a lot of things that doesn't fit within the normal thinking about what a charity should do though. OCLC looks like a sad demonstration of that.. buying up competitors, screwing people on licensing, etc.",1226911119

366696,comment,365331,366686,0,0,netcan,,,"Look. I'm not particularly experienced in this. Honestly, I probably would provide whatever was asked & not make a big deal & be cooperative.<p>I'm just trying to rationalise the undertone all over this thread which I naturally sympathise with. As an applicant, you are expected to meet whatever terms are presented. This leads to a convention favouring employers that feels belittling to employees. You are to provide whatever information is asked. You are to take whatever information is given. Otherwise, it is a strike against you. Maybe one point (providing salary info) is strategically important to take a stand & take the hit. As you say, they can get away with one. But you start on the back foot.<p>I have experienced & have heard from friends & family of many many situations where the employer did not reveal the salary level until the point where they were really looking for a yes/no. In many cases, I've known people to take jobs without knowing (but having a good guess). This is probably out of their timidity & new graduates workforce returnees etc. are more prone to it then technical employees that find it easier to find jobs. But it's not uncommon & it is abusive to an extent.<p>It's not uncommon not to hear back for months or ever. It's not uncommon to be told you're being considered, & being left to stew for weeks.<p>I imagine that asking for reference equivalents (can i speak to some recent recruits?) would be seen similarly to asking to provide references at a later date: uncooperative. Asking about previous  salaries is just another point. But (whether this is true or not) will seem like it puts you at a disadvantage in negotiating where you would not be able to gain the same. (how much do your last three hires earn?)<p>Many employers try hard to maintain their names as good employers. But it seems that the marketing stops once you have put in an application.<p>Look at it this way. Most potential employees are very intentional in the questions they ask. They are not intended to evaluate the employer. They are intended to make an impression by showing you care about the right things. It doesn't seem that employers try to sell themselves at all during the interview process. That is not a pleasant situations. Reality says you deal with it(& blog in defiance). But Noone likes it.",1226910271

366690,comment,366532,366532,0,0,ggruschow,,,"Sounds like they're ""fighting"" traffic jams as much as most meteorologists ""fight"" the weather. They're making a more automated, cheaper way to compete with traffic reports on radio and TV. They even share the same way to monetize it: ads on the ""feed"". I don't even know if they'll end up providing more accurate, timely, or precise data than the current staff monitoring CCTV feeds and watching from helicopters.<p>I kept wanting to hear that they were trying to attack traffic jams via some means of automated coordination of the cars. It's a tough problem, especially because many people think of their car as a means to personal freedom, and you have to make it useful even without most cars participating.<p>Attacking traffic jams would be a big win for society and drivers though.. Reduce road rage, improve gas mileage, improve workforce productivity, lower emissions, etc. It's so big, perhaps you could even monetize it by directly rewarding drivers that do attack the problem.. either by directly paying them $ or favoring their speed through jams when requested.",1226909662

I'm disappointed that your spam made it through to HN, but am glad to see the very on-target comments it has generated.<p>Also making a snap judgment that someone under the pressure of an interview situation is ""boring"" is probably a mistake. Sounds like there is something else going on. The fact that you call developers ""coders"" is pretty damning of your attitude, imho.",1226909507

366686,comment,365331,366614,0,0,ghshephard,,,"I don't buy this - When someone who wants to use me as a reference starts interviewing - they call me and say ""I'd like to use you as a reference, is that OK?  Can you give me a call if anyone contacts you""<p>That's about it.  When I get a call, it's usually because a job offer is about to be made, and both myself and the individual I'm providing a reference for are happy to have that call go out.<p>Re: Filling out application forms - the first one is a pain as you try and figure out who your emergency contact is, what your home phone number and mailing address is, the dates/names of your last 5 years of jobs, and what the contact information for your references is.  Once that's done, it is fairly straightforward, as the information typically doesn't change for the 4-6 months you'll be looking for a job.<p>Also, If you've made it to the point at which we are interviewing you, you probably have a > 33% chance of being hired.  You've been phone screened at least twice, and your resume has been reviewed carefully a few times.  You are filling in that application letter because there is a good chance we want to hire you, and we need the information you are filling in.<p>Just to be clear - I haven't personally ever had an applicant not fill in the section on references on the application form, so it's a non-issue for me.  I bring it up only because we did have a candidate in another department indicate they wouldn't provide references unless a job offer was going to be made - not the end of the world, but it would be important that that was the only ""No, I won't cooperate"" moment in the interview process.",1226909130

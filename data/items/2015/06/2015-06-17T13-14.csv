That is utter bullshit. Yes, it says &quot;most prevalent flat maps&quot; in the subtitle but even that seems not based on anything but agenda. Mercator is often used today with online maps because people (especially journalists) just <i>love</i> Google Maps (which uses Web Mercator by default) and seem incapable of learning about alternatives or just map projections.<p>Yes, the projection can be a problem and yes, this is a fun way illustrating it but please go the extra mile and do it scientifically as your name suggests. What projection was used for this example? Is the 3D actually geodetically correct or did another oblivious artist scale and move things so they look nice?",1434549596

Measuring the quality of code is tricky and certainly modularity is a positive, but just having a short fast code path doesn&#x27;t mean the code isn&#x27;t modular.<p>I took a brief glance at the wheezy repo.  The functions and methods looked pretty modular to me.<p><pre><code>    $ sloccount $(find src -type d| grep -v tests)

    994     handlers        python=994
    451     src             python=451
    316     middleware      python=316

    Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
    python:        1761 (100.00%)
</code></pre>
Only 1761 non-test LOC, hmm... let&#x27;s find out how large the functions <i></i>really<i></i> are:<p><pre><code>     $ cat $( find scr -name &#x27;*.py&#x27; | grep -v tests ) | grep &#x27;def &#x27; | wc -l

Yeah you should write short functions, but long functions happen.)<p>Your second example is much harder to reason about if someone comes in and adds:<p><pre><code>    if ( (a && b) || c)

So then what happens with the second clause? (Or what even should happen with the second clause?)<p>On a meta note, any time I see multiple tests in an if statement, I try to pull it into local booleans that describe the intent instead. At the very least then if you add more conditions to the if statement, you have to update the names of the boolean for it to make sense, and so the code stays implicitly commented.",1434549498

9731756,comment,9729916,9730423,0,0,pascalmemories,,,"Except in the UK you have Transfer of Undertakings and Protection of Employment (TUPE[1]) to protect you from being handed a &#x27;new&#x27; contract on acquisition.  You must not have worse terms than with your previous employer.  You certainly cannot be forced to hand over IP which was not covered under the previous contract.<p>Employers bent on evil normally give you around 3 months then &#x27;restructure&#x27; the company (i.e. give you a new job title) as a mechanism to say it is a new job and not covered.  They still need to wait 90 days before they can enforce that and you have the option to reject it (but get your CV updated in the meantime because you&#x27;re leaving).<p>Employment law varies enormously from state to state, country to country etc.  People in the US used to At Will will have no concept of what it is like to be With Cause (and vice-versa).<p>However, even With Cause employers can get rid of anyone they want.  In the UK it&#x27;s classed as a &#x27;right to manage your business&#x27; and the worst downside is a small compensation payment which rarely exceeds a few thousand pounds (occasionally there are large payouts for the most egregious things, especially racist or sexist bullying).  In the US, payouts could be larger but for many businesses they just see that as part of the exit package and budget accordingly.  Always remember, in a business, no-one cares about you and these people are not your friends.<p>Having been through it multiple times, my advice is always have your CV up to date and if you don&#x27;t like the look or smell of the situation, it&#x27;s time to leave.  You will feel much better and less stressed if you feel in control of your destiny and not being played by some Evil Overlord who doesn&#x27;t give a damn about you.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUPE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUPE</a>",1434549426

It’s this traversing of abstraction and concrete implementation that I believe takes someone past the early stage and into the junior programmer world.

I do, and have worked in electronics manufacturing my whole career (15 years).  My company is based in the US (San Jose) but the two largest campuses are in Mexico & China, each of which contains >10,000 employees.<p>Yes, making electronics in the US would cost more, but you&#x27;d be surprised at what &quot;cost&quot; is most important to corporations when making those kinds of decisions.  Depending what is being built, time to market & location of profit/revenue can be more critical than labor cost.  At this point, Chinese wages in the first mover cities of Shenzhen/Guangzhou and Shanghai/Hangzhou/Kunshan have increased to the point of being noncompetitive with other regional options (Malaysia, Vietnam, Bangladesh), but because the Chinese domestic market is so huge, many companies are just relocating to cheaper places like Dalian, Fujian or Chengdu.  Having the entire supply chain in one country is hugely compelling.<p>Factory labor in the US, even in high skill, high tech manufacturing, is still typically <$15/hr, with starting pay closer to $10/hr in many places.  It doesn&#x27;t make a bit of sense to build things like mops & brooms here, nor does it make sense to build extremely low margin electronics (like many consumer goods), but the manufacturing economy in the US is actually thriving now.  It just happens that it&#x27;s lately been high margin, complex stuff, military equipment, and a few other select types of goods.<p>US corporate taxes are too high, but the EPA isn&#x27;t strong enough (in my backyard, just look at how Duke Energy got away with throwing coal ash into a local river for yeeaaaarrs).  Most electronics factories produce nearly 0 CO2 emissions anyway.  That&#x27;s mostly limited to heavy industry & raw materials refining.  State governments make stupid decisions, too, like offering short term tax breaks for companies to invest in factories there, but with no consideration for what happens when the company leaves immediately after the tax incentives disappear.  Again in my backyard (North Carolina), we lead the nation in solar farm investment in 2014 ... but it was 80% due to tax incentives and 20% due to Apple & Google building data centers here.<p>I don&#x27;t think the problem is NIMBY politics in most cases.  The problem is short sighted politicians and greedy consumers.",1434547183

Apple requires that the developer provide legal permission for this, and will refuse to distribute if there is license incompatibility or other problems regarding copyright. If a developer sub-license other peoples copyrighted work like code, images, video or content in general, it is the developer that must shoulder any and all responsibility.

They convert via coninbase and have USD in their account almost immediately.<p>Alternatively I send a wire transfer to a US bank, now I have to pay a fee (around about £25 flat fee plus a % on the exchange rate conversion from USD to GBP, or I send it in GBP and let the receiver worry about converting it to USD). The wire transfer takes 5 days to acheive what was achieved using bitcoin in a matter of minutes.<p>So they are not the same service unless coinbase wants to take on the risk of paying out immediately in USD to the recevier and the wire transfer not arriving or of a change in the exchange rate that results in a loss for them as they receive less USD than the GBP they received. Also they have to eat the £25 wire transfer fee as the bitcoin transaction has no fees.<p>So ultimately the bitcoin based exchange is faster, cheaper and more secure than the legacy banking system wire transfer.<p>Yes coinbase could profit a small amount on exchange rate fee but that comes with accepting a significant amount of risk and making the process as long winded as the current wire transfer system is. The pointof this is that it all happens pretty immediately and at little cost.<p>This is how i imagine bitcoin will ultimately succeed, we wont use it in day to day transactions (with the exception of online purchasing) but it will underpin the transfer of fiat currencies from country to country or person to person.",1434546774

Given that all modules supposedly have stable interfaces, documentation, tests, reasonable size, yada yada then one might expect that each of their dependencies takes advantage of these properties to maintain light and wonderful themselves.<p>Of course, this is a situation that&#x27;s highly incompatible with C. Let&#x27;s ditch that.<p>In ML modules are king. You probably make hundreds in any non-trivial program and the compiler will beat your ass if you muck up their interfaces. Anywhere. Packages are just sets of 3 public modules wrapped up in twine and a README file (coincidentally this is where &quot;ownership and lifecycle&quot; are managed, but, sorry, I&#x27;m going to ignore those for a moment).<p>This could be every bit as bad as I described before, but ML also realized that modules which just form a big dependency tree are actually quite annoying. The whole reason we define public APIs is so that there can be multiple satisficing inplementors, but this cannot be in 99% of module technologies today.<p>So ML has functors (not Haskell functors, certainly certainly certainly not C++ functors) which are &quot;parameterized modules that actually work&quot;. One could distribute their command line parsing module with a pluggable serialization and a pluggable help display. See MirageOS for a giant example of this kind of system working out.<p>Does it really work?<p>Probably not. It&#x27;s not in most maintainers DNA to functor-ize everything. It&#x27;s even a significant challenge to do so since you need to define sufficient external <i>and</i> internal public APIs and it&#x27;s a significant community effort to standardize these sufficiently so that there is significant chance of re-use.<p>But at least it&#x27;s a way forward. Fight the heavy module trees. Let&#x27;s use some higher order reusability.",1434546198

Given that the iPad version of ""Pages"" will be about $10 (and from what we've seen it's definitely at the high-end of the quality scale) I wouldn't expect a significant difference in price compared to existing (quality) iPhone apps.

1186781,comment,1186486,1186688,0,0,barrkel,,,"There may be an inverse correspondence between risk appetite and quality of life at the high end. Many European countries have a fairly high degree of social cohesion, resulting in a kind of contract between the state and its people: reduce the downside risks of life in return for more regulation and higher taxes. Part of reducing the downside risk is a kind of conservatism, a maintenance of the status quo, with social bargaining and efforts to reduce the impact, speed and consequentially the profitability of change.<p>But if you're younger, have less to lose, and more appetite for risk, this can look unappealing. It acts as a kind of club that you have to break into, for one thing - too many young people in Europe work on the basis of short-term contracts rather than full-time pensionable positions.<p>FWIW, speaking as an Irishman living in the UK and holder of a H-1B visa, there's a lot to dislike about the Bay Area too, some of which has informed my decision not to move there (as yet).

They could immigrate to Canada - unlike America, Canada welcomes people with open arms. Forget that rubbish about ""all the expertise is in Silicon Valley"". There is no shortage of smart, experienced people in other countries. Heck, in Vancouver they would just be a short hop away from the valley if they really must be (although why you'd want to leave Vancouver beats me... think San Francisco, except much nicer).<p>And of course, they could always do this in Holland. Seriously, why not? It's not like a business never became successful in Holland.<p>Personally as someone who is dealing with US immigration bureaucracy, I am opposed to the founder visa because on the very long list of things that need to be fixed with immigration in America and that would also benefit the US economy, this one is item #217.

For every universe with the level of organization we see, there should be an enormous number of lone Boltzmann brains floating around in unorganized environments. This refutes the observer argument above: the organization I see is vastly more than what is required to explain my consciousness, and therefore it is highly unlikely that I am the result of a stochastic fluctuation.<p>The Boltzmann brain paradox is that it is more likely that a brain randomly forms out of the chaos with false memories of its life than that the universe around us would have billions of self-aware brains.</i>",1268405034

Yes, the folks who thought Google Street View was an invasion of privacy were a little extreme but they certainly don’t represent the only people who are concerned about keeping things private.<p>The second thing this article does is to obscure the point with restrictive surveys.  Yes, teens generally don’t care about their privacy because they don’t have professional reputations to up hold or jobs to lose.  It’s when you start building a life for yourself that you realize how tragic it would be to lose your lifestyle because you said something stupid on Facebook.  So using teens as your only data point is misleading.<p>In the end this is a Google propaganda piece IMHO.  Google benefits from things being public because the more public stuff that’s out there the more ads they can sell.

3202121,comment,3202081,3202081,6,0,chx,,,"This rant is completely outdated and it shows: ""pre transaction log"" ""fixed this in 1.8"". You realize MongoDB is at 2.0 now and the transaction log was introduced in 1.8, right? Yes, MongoDB had problems but since the transaction log it's pretty good. I have used MongoDB since early 1.3 and I knew what I was doing and we never lost a bit of data. There is a tradeoff -- while MongoDB handled write load easily that a MySQL box with 2-3 times the RAM , I/O capability couldn't at all we understood the bleeding edge of using MongoDB back then. We have, for example, kept a snapshot slave which shot itself down often, took an LVM snapshot then continued replicating. Never needed those.<p>We have meticulously kept a QA server pair around and the only time when I have ran into a data loss problem was when I have hosed one of those -- but only one and even the QA department could continue (and hosing that server was me not knowing that Redhat 5 had separate e4fsprogs and e2fsprogs, only partially MongoDB fault but now it works without O_DIRECT so even this would not be a problem any more) . Never understood for example how could foursquare get where they got to -- didnt they have a QA copy similarly?",1320564893

It's not a single click. The first click is the initial submit button (""Compile Free Report""), followed by a link to download the actual report. I automatically get turned off whenever I'm required to download something in order to try out a service/product. I think it's worse than requiring an e-mail signup, because I feel like its encroaching on my computer's security on the local level. The only reason I went through with it anyways was to provide some feedback.<p>I feel like you may lose a lot of users this way because you're asking them to do YOU a favor (download an unknown file from a not-yet trusted source), without even offering a reason/incentive to them to begin with. I have no idea what's in the report, or if it will even benefit me. It sounds scammy. It would be helpful if you at least included a preview of the report prior to the download link, so that I could determine the value of the report and decide if I'm interested in downloading the rest on my own accord.<p>2) 50% of my report is blank, and 100% of it is inaccurate. I submitted my domain willworkforamac.com . My Mixpanel and Google analytics data from the past month indicates that I've been averaging a couple hundred of unique visitors a week, from various regions among almost all continents.

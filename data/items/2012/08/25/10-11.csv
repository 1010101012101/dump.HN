They have the perception as being 'the only system with the good apps' (iPad) - noticeably they don't have that any more with the iPhone. Realistically, how long can they keep it with the iPad and, once lost, what means do they have of getting it back? And what's Apple's plan to maintain its current market advantages of consistency once the mobile market moves from high-end luxury to commodity that needs a tiered product range?<p>How many new Android devices come out per year, even just from the major top-tier devices? How many from Apple? To sustain the current position, Apple have to win and be lucky <i>every time</i>. Android can afford below a 10% hit rate and it'll <i>still</i> innovate faster and grow more strongly as a platform than iOS.<p>Apple now are in much the same position as they were the first time they lost Steve Jobs. Their five year outlook is, IMHO, grim - their profits come overwhelmingly from iOS but it's under heavy attack and has no obvious strategy to grow their base without cutting off what made them a success.<p>Apple are (medium-term) on the crest of a wave.

Mainly because any single thing isn't going to be enough to get you a job, or possibly even an interview.<p>My suggestions:<p>1. Put up as much of your course work as possible on GitHub. This gives an employer the chance to look at your code, and shows you can use Git.<p>2. Take on a project to build something. Possibly your course work covers this, I don't know. I'd suggest some simple app/website/gizmo which actually does something. It doesn't have to be unique but should show you can build a larger project without creating a confusing mess.<p>3. Rinse and repeat. The above would be enough to land you a junior developer job assuming you're actually good enough at the coding. You can always learn more and more, ie security, scalability, design etc. I'd look into any of those if they interest you.

4431708,comment,4426014,4426014,2,0,JohnLBevan,,,"Given the number of people on here who appreciate a good life hack, has anyone got any ideas for other solutions?  My family's currently going through the to home or not to home question.  Arguments for standard solutions are essentially:<p>- A care home offers full time protection, but displaces the person from their familiar environment.  Some care homes also don't attend their patients but focus on making a profit; though we hope that by visiting often and looking at existing patients we can get an idea of which ones are suitable.  It costs money, but the money in this case comes from my Nan's savings, and she's not going to be spending it on anything more than basic living costs anyway.  My family don't need the money, so though in some cases inheritance is a concert (i.e. people save up through their lives to provide for their family even in death), that's not a concern for our situation.<p>-  Leaving the person in their own home seems the nicest but least practical option.  Having family members or carers visit frequently to keep an eye on the person adds in some security, but family can't be there all the time (we're talking a 90 minute drive there in good traffic; so 3 hours round trip) and carers aren't immediately recognised so can seem an intrusion to the sufferer, often leading to stressful confrontations.<p>- Having the person move in with their children gives full time protection by people who know and love them, but strips their children of freedom (their lives essentially becoming that of full time carers with the added depression of watching someone they love fade away).<p>On top of the above there are also internal family conflicts; for example my aunt is pushing for the state to fund any care solution (by not doing anything to help ourselves so the state acts as a catch statement) whilst my mum feels we should do all we can as well as taking what the state offers - but both working together (i.e. my mum & aunt have been given responsibility over my nan's care and assets on the condition they use those assets to my nan's best interest - trying to squeeze more out of the state isn't in her best interests, but may mean that my mum & aunt would lose their rights because by not using my nan's assets they're being irresponsible; the state could then take control of those assets and make all decisions without my mum or aunt's input).<p>Given all of these factors (and I'm sure you can all think of more), what other ideas can you come up with to improve the system to provide a solution which gives people security and dignity, whilst ensuring that families still maintain some freedom to experience their own lives?",1345891009

4431701,comment,4431382,4431472,2,0,netcan,,,"Most innovations are not patentable. Most notably are most business models.<p>Think of Groupon's business model. There's nothing specifically innovative about it: forced email list, 1 product per day, discounts. But, put together it formed a successful business model. Had they not thought of it and tested it in the marketplace all their copy-cat competitors probably would not exist today either.<p>At some stage someone someone invented department stores. Someone hypothesized that yuppie americans would like to eat sushi. Someone thought that doing massages in full view in malls would create a new market of people who wouldn't have gone through the book-in-advance, go behind a heavy curtain, 1 hour minimum normally associated with the trade. In Australia I would guess that this last one tripled (or more) the massage therapy market.<p>It's hard to talk about patents without slipping into the legalize definitions of important concepts like <i>'non-trivial'</i> but I think a common sense definition is <i>'wouldn't have been invented otherwise.'</i>  A lot of these innovations are genuinely  nontrivial by that definition.<p>They weren't developed in r&d labs but they are all genuinely innovative. They didn't spend huge sums on r&d but someone did the economic cousin of spending, they risked (usually personally) a lot testing them in the market. Much or most of the profits eventually went to copycats. Without the innovator most would not have existed today. They still got invented. I doubt that patenting would increase their rate of invention. I'm sure that patenting would have harmed consumers.<p>I'm not saying this as a general refutation of patents. I don't know what the correct laws are. I think though that any patent laws are always going to leave us with huge ugly deckfulls of by-catch. Mostly skate & sunfish.

From iMac, to iTunes to iPods/iPhones/iPads.<p>So the notion that Apple would launch into litigation ""just for the money"" seems misguided, at the least - if only for the fact that if they lost the suit, there could be significant ramifications for their sales (e.g. an injunction against selling any of the products in the suit for X period of time, etc.). With sales and revenues growing as much as they are, a wrongly filed lawsuit can be even more risky than rewarding.<p>For a company as wealthy (and innovative) as Apple, there are more considerations than just protecting market share and trying to extract patent rent from competitors as a revenue stream.<p>There are many other companies that come out with many features in their products that Apple doesn't sue. See Windows, Safari vs Chrome, iPod vs Zune, Adobe Premiere vs Final Cut Pro, most ""ultrabooks"" vs Macbook Air, etc.<p>The issue here is that Samsung, HTC, et al. essentially have done what many companies in China have done. They acted like a hardware manufacturing partner - then using the inside knowledge they gained of the intimate architecture of the products, they reverse engineered them and competed directly.<p>That's like you hiring a web developer to build your startup - and both of you build it to traction, and once you take all the risk and prove the market, (s)he leaves and builds a direct competitor using his insider knowledge.<p>It's the most insiduous kind of 'IP stealing' that you can get.<p>If you had that done to you, and your ex-developer (in fact, he is still managing your codebase) is making a ton of money off of your ideas and IP in your market, I am sure you would be pissed too.<p>The money is just sprinkling on top.<p>Also, I think it is hard to argue that Apple doesn't pour their hearts into what they do. That's why they are the most valuable company on the planet and will continue to be for years to come. It's because of the rate at which they innovate.<p>Not the rate at which they copy.<p>So cut them some slack, and walk a mile in their shoes.",1345889844

But you are again applying retrospecitivity (at least in my mind) - you need to remove that. Just because something is simple - doesnt mean it is not innovative. You contend that simply because something is simple that therefore it fails the test of obviousness - but that is not true and it's right that it's not true.<p>The test is asking whether the invention is an adequate distance beyond or above the state of the art. The state of the art at the time had no idea of such a simple one-click method - if it did - why wasn't it invented ? The fact it can be implemented <i>so easily</i> is irrelevant to fundamental idea that its innovative, non-obvious and unique. The best ideas are usually the ones no one see's and yes I am a front-end dev so I deal with more interaction components than anything.<p>Patents do not protect development effort - they protect novel, non-obvious and useful concept's. If they protected development effort - it would be a requirement to actually develop the idea and there is no such requirement and indeed many inventions wouldn't be possible to protect if such a requirement existed - that is, you must fully develop the invention before being granted protection.

4431661,comment,4427031,4427031,1,0,powatom,,,"TL;DR - This was originally a reply to another commenter. There seems to be a lot of people accusing Backbone of failing to provide things that it has never claimed to provide. This is a bit of a rant so apologies in advance! Obviously YMMV but I've been batting these criticisms of Backbone away left, right, and center recently.<p>To summarise: If you need a framework, then Backbone is not what you're looking for. Use something else, because in all likelihood Backbone will not give you the tools you're looking for. Backbone solves a different problem.<p>====<p>The only real 'major' problem with Backbone.js is that people for some reason think it's a framework. It is not, and as far as I'm aware it has never claimed, or attempted, to be one.<p>The real, underlying problems that Backbone attempts to solve are the following:<p>1: Unstructured, spaghetti JS code.<p>2: Complicated DOM traversal / outrageously convoluted jQuery selectors.<p>3: Total lack of templating.<p>4: Generally crap organisation of your application.<p>Customers / users are constantly requesting more dynamic pages. You know that form which adds a new item to the Foo list? Why does it have to refresh the entire page? Why can't I drag and drop stuff like I can with every other application I use on my computer?<p>Customers are realising that they CAN do cool stuff in their browser now, and you better believe you're going to get a call asking you to turn a previously read-only site into a fully dynamic web app. So you do what every other dev does and rewrite the whole thing from scratch using a proper framework and it's all nicely designed and fully specced out. Or not. What actually happens is your customer doesn't have enough money for a re-write. They want all the existing features, but they want the development phased. Your boss / colleague / dog wouldn't let you re-write the damn thing anyway because they assume that it's just a case of cut + paste from another application somebody who no longer works there wrote 10 years ago. So you do it step by step. You do it page by page / feature by feature. That page which displayed a list of items now displays new items automatically, you don't need to refresh the page! Adding a new item is a simple AJAX call back to the server. Notifications? Done!<p>And then a bug is found. Suddenly you realise you have no real way of isolating your model from the DOM. You're hiding data in hidden input fields so you can retrieve it via jQuery later and do something with it - maybe some AJAX request to the server. It takes you a day to fix a bug that should only take 5 minutes. It takes you a month to add a new feature that should only take a few days.<p>It seems like only in web development do developers have this (when you think about it) really, truly, WEIRD approach to building applications. We let the data provider build our user interface. We don't bother with models - just hide data in the DOM and get it back when a user clicks a button. Need to represent the same data in two different ways? Build a new View in your rails app and add a ton of logic to change how it looks based on the model's data. Why do we have an MVC framework server side and then forget all about it on the client-side?<p>When you think about a web application PROPERLY, the insanity becomes obvious. In what other development domain do we allow the data provider (the server) to render the user interface? Why do we discard models and proper encapsulation? Why do we weave logic into views which should really live in a model / controller? What the hell have we been doing to ourselves?<p>A lot of web app developers think they're building the following:<p><pre><code>  Server (Model / Controllers) - GIMME DEM HTMLZ -> Browser(View)\n</code></pre>\nWhat they SHOULD be thinking about building is:<p><pre><code>  Server (Data Provider / API) <-- DATA TRANSPORT --> Client (Model / View / Controller)\n</code></pre>\nThe fact that you're using HTML and JS to develop an application is merely incidental. Your server provides you with some data - it's insanity to also let it define what that data should look like when it arrives client-side.<p>Backbone.js aims to solve THESE problems. It is not an application framework. It gives you a few basic objects and hopes a light bulb flickers on above your head. Suddenly you realise that hey - you CAN isolate your models from your views. You CAN have multiple views per model. You CAN have proper event handling, just like you can in every other non-web application you've ever written. Hurrah! Need to extend your model? Easy! How about displaying the same model - once as a full page, once as a widget in a sidebar? Simple! Need to update the view when your model gets updated? Piece of cake!<p>Backbone is a solution to a lack of structure. It is not a framework. There is no convention, no 'right way' to do things. Backbone is exactly what the name suggests: a spine for your application. Everything else - your framework, your error handling system, your security mechanisms - these are all left for you to figure out yourself. You can pick a framework built on top of Backbone, or you can figure one out for yourself. Backbone doesn't magically turn your web app into a modular, extensible system - but try to build one WITHOUT Backbone or something similar and see how far you get before you realise you've got serious problems.<p><pre><code>  > Nested views and automatic view updates.\n</code></pre>\nNot Backbone's problem. It doesn't even attempt to solve this issue as far as I'm aware. Solve it yourself, or use something which does.<p><pre><code>  > How would you display a list of items in backbone? What do you do when an element is removed/added?\n</code></pre>\nHow is this Backbone's problem? How would you do it in any other programming language aside from JS? Port it to JS, and your problem's solved.<p><pre><code>  > How do you update a view when an element changes?\n</code></pre>\nIt SHOULD just be as simple as calling your render() method? If your rendering code is incapable of not fucking this up, then it's your own fault.<p>At the end of the day - Backbone is not there to hold your hand. If you can't figure the above problems out on your own, then Backbone is probably not for you. Backbone is even agnostic about how exactly you draw your views onto the page. Want to stick a shit-ton of logic in your template? Fine - but leave Backbone out of it - that's between you and your templating engine!<p>Backbone gives you a solid foundation. Everything else is just arms and legs.",1345889196

Data processing for political surveys.)<p>Quickbasic made sense back in the day where you had limited graphical and sound power. When you booted a computer and you got a basic command prompt. When you learned the basics of computers and programming by typing in programs from magazines.<p>Basic does not make sense in today's world. It is complicated unnecessarily and it doesn't have some of the advantages that more modern languages like Ruby and Python have. It doesn't have the library support that these languages have that allow you to easily do things like build web pages, simple media players, and other such things with ease.",1263121194

That's not to say that a BASIC is a <i>bad</i> thing for a kid to learn, but if you can give them an easy to use language that gives them more power and in terms that can be applied outside of this environment, you ought to.  What language would be best?  Who knows, but I think we can do better than a BASIC.<p>This is something I'm going to have to think more about; if nothing else, this interests me from a programming language design angle.  If I can create a language that's easy for kids to pick up while being useful outside of education, that'd be pretty damn neat.",1263121064

1042929,comment,1042686,1042831,0,0,simonw,,,"Completely agree that practise is key. Three tips for getting practise:<p>1. Give lightning talks. These are sessions at conferences where people are encouraged to give 5 minute talks. The audience love them because it forces speakers to get straight to the point, and if a talk sucks you only have to wait a few minutes before the next one. They are a fantastic way for new speakers to get some experience in front of a crowd.<p>2. Go to BarCamps. London has an excellent BarCamp scene (events have been hosted at Yahoo!, BT, Google, GCap, EBay, the Guardian and IBM) Nd events generally pull 150 people, each of whom is encouraged to speak. This guarantees a friendly, supportive audience since everyone else is presenting as well. You can also talk about any topic you like. I've presented at all 7 London BarCamps and it's definitely helped me with my public speaking skills.<p>3. Any talk you give, make sure you have practises it out loud at least once with enough time to fix the bits that don't work. Under your breath doesn't cut it in my experience. My rule of thumb these days is a minimum of 10 hours preparation for every 1 hour on stage, and the run throughs are a big part of that.",1263120081

1042922,comment,1042896,1042896,0,0,daeken,,,"This is just downright cool.  I look back at my childhood and one thing stands out to me, with respect to programming: I was able to sit down at the Apple ][E in my kindergarten class and start writing games with no knowledge of programming.  All I had was a ridiculously bad book on BASIC from the school library and an immediate feedback loop.  Kids these days don't seem to have that.  Programming languages have gotten considerably easier to use, but the environment and the libraries just aren't there.<p>Now, I'm not proposing that kids should be learning QBASIC, but with all of the technology we have these days, why can't a kid browse to a website and get an environment in which they can experiment and create something, with the instantaneous feedback that I appreciated when I was getting started?  I know there's been some talk of things like this in the past, but has anything come of it?  If not, what were the problems that were faced?<p>I'd love for my (not yet existent) kids to be able to open up a browser and be able to start writing code.

Why would I want to have a website?'<p>""And then in the last 5 or 6 years, blogging has taken off in a huge way and all these different services that have people sharing all this information. People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.<p>""We view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and be updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms are.<p>""A lot of companies would be trapped by the conventions and their legacies of what they've built, doing a privacy change - doing a privacy change for 350 million users is not the kind of thing that a lot of companies would do.

1042900,comment,1042122,1042166,0,0,yason,,,"Probably not but you can only judge a language when you've written lot of code in it. If you write large non-trivial programs in ― for example ― bash, you'll only have to look up bash.1 so many times after which you just absorb it. Then you'll see how things click together and you don't need the manual much after that.<p>I like bash. Especially bash v4 brought some niceties, making it even more suitable for various non-trivial tasks.<p>I generally don't ""upgrade"" to Python or some ""real"" scripting language unless I really have to: bash is surprisingly concise and expressive. I've written programs and subroutines in bash that were much smaller than their idiomatic Python counterparts and I was surprised to discover that.<p>Bash is conceptually pretty safe and suits the functional mindset because in a large program you find you want to isolate each function the Unix way: byte streams. You pass in a stream (and args) and you get a stream out (and exit status). Thus, you end up making the functions quite pure and well off if you come from a functional background. Pure functions/shell scripts are rather safe and also parallelize pretty well.<p>If part of your program does something critical it's best to move it from a set of functions into a separate shell script. This gives you the same Unix stream API but also the benefit of process-level separation of data and environment. It simply enforces the Unix byte streams as the only way to talk between the caller and the callee.<p>And usually you can do this with only a few lines of code. Shell scripting can be ― and is ― intuitive. This is because processing files and streams, I/O, and parsing and mangling command lines and strings of words is pretty implicit in bash, which usually is very close to what you want to achieve in the end so you get down to the actual work pretty quick.",1263117814

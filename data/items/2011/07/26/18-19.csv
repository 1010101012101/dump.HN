2808920,comment,2808833,2808833,1,0,kenjackson,,,"This isn't about high positions.  This is about choice of profession.  I can buy your argument for why men become CxOs (although based on people I've worked with in the past who have said they'd never report to a woman, I think sexism plays a large role in our industry), it doesn't explain why women as a whole go into poorer paying fields.<p>Psychology is the classic example.  Few women in the field in the 60s, and pay was relatively good.  By the late 90s it became dominated by women and the pay dropped signficantly.  Did women go into because the pay was low, or did the pay drop when women went into it?  You can find people who argue either side.<p>But the point is, there's never been an industry that women have gone into that has become a high paying field.<p>The best way for your son to be a financial success is to not go into whatever his sister is going into.  :-)",1311706704

That guarantees you actually hit all cache entries, while picking a ""round"" number like 1024 underutilizes the cache severely, which is unfair if you were trying to simulate random performance.<p><i>edit</i>: Actually, in this case it doesn't really matter since your values aren't expected to be in-cache anyway.",1311706669

Traditional thank you notes required way too much planning in today's fast paced environment (ie. stamps, stationary, envelops, contact info, etc.). Not to mention the environmental impact using all that paper has.<p>E-Greeting card sites are just as tedious as traditional thank you notes. The typical process requires a user to first sign up, then they have to take several steps to create a card before actually getting to do what matters most, send it. Not to mention that during creation many users are bombarded with 100's of fonts, themes, graphics, etc. (too many choices). These sites don't solve the problem very well in our opinion.<p>Many people have resorted to sending thanks via social status messages, which isn't nearly as personal, meaningful or effective. We created Thankuz as an alternative to these options and think it fills the large gap between traditional handwritten thank you notes, and less formal social status updates.<p>The Proposed Solution:<p>First and foremost, we built Thankuz for ourselves.<p>The Thankuz Web App was created to make it easier for anyone to say, ""Thank You"" to People, Places or Things for Gifts, Acts and Expressions via instant thank you notes.<p>We've recently released our MVP and would greatly appreciate some feedback from the HN community.<p>Here's an example note: http://thankuz.com/notes/io0w0rf<p>Thank You, Matt Franklin",1311706378

It's possible women may not be particularly good at these jobs, artificial boundaries certainly don't help your case.<p>2) There are other low paying industries dominated by women.

I'm surprised this actually is faster, but if it is only by 10%, then I still think the memory-less algorithm is preferable.<p>On modern-day systems main memory access is much slower than the processor, and on multi-core systems (which are the norm these days, though not all cores are always in use, of course) the memory bus can easily become a bottleneck.  Benchmarks tend to hide that fact because they are often run on a single core on an otherwise idle system, so they usually have all memory bandwidth and cache memory to themselves, which isn't really representative of real-world systems.<p>For that reason, I believe that algorithms that do not depend on fast memory access to work efficiently are preferable to those that make use of large memory caches, at least if the performance difference isn't too great.",1311706236

This is from memory, but here's how I remember that experiment working:<p>In that experiment, they showed that, for some value of <i>n</i>, rod cells consistently activated in response n photons, and did not activate in response to <i>(n-1)</i> photons. Thus, they argue, rods are sensitive to single photons.<p>In some sense, they're right, in a straw that breaks the camel's back sort of way. However, the common mis-interpretation of these results is that <i>n=1</i>; that is, in utter darkness a rod cell would fire in response to a single photon. But this is not what the experiment showed.<p>(Note that just because a rod cell activates doesn't mean that the organism would perceive light. In order for a signal to reach the optic nerve, a retinal ganglion cell needs to activate. Ganglion cells only activate in response to the activation of a significant number of photoreceptors. Only in some part of the fovea, where there are no rods, is there a 1:1 mapping of photoreceptor to ganglion cell. In most parts of the retina the ratio is closer to 1 ganglion cell per 100 photoreceptors. Furthermore, even if a ganglion cell activates and a signal reaches the optic nerve, that <i>still</i> doesn't mean that the organism will perceive light. It's likely that further levels of processing may filter out transient activations.)",1311704906

As such, you only need to query p1,p3 or p2,p4 to cover the entire keyspace.<p>In general, approximately RingSize / N partitions need to be queried. The new smart coverage code figures this out as well as deals with routing around failed nodes and other issues.<p>EDIT: Since the replicas value (N) is settable per bucket in Riak, there's some interesting extreme cases that you could envision here. For example, you could have a bucket where N = RingSize, in which case the index is replicated to every node and you only need to query a single partition to lookup values. Of course, then you lose the ability to perform multiple queries in parallel with a more partitioned/distributed index space (which would be more useful for large results sets).

If you were profile your code again, you might find a sizable change (and if not, please feel free to send the profile output to the Moose mailing list for us to review).",1311704623

Right now we're not really a part of nature anymore but we're not yet independently functioning entities either. By developing intellect and the deeper consciousness that goes with it, we stopped being a mere collection of genes. In fact, in quite a few respects our genes and our minds have opposing interests now. In order to grow and embrace the aspect that we have minds, we need to totally master the biological substrate that gave birth to us or maybe we even move completely beyond it. In practice, it's probably going to be a combination of the two.<p>When I say we're hanging in a weird half-state between nature and intellect I'm referring to this kind of existential identity crisis. A lot of people <i>do</i> believe we're first and foremost genomes walking around. A lot of people <i>do</i> believe that this discourse is irrelevant because they have religious views that already have a monopoly on the meaning of life. But at the same time, there are some people who would like to keep moving forward towards a far horizon that we can already glimpse. In fact, for some of us it is an ethical imperative.<p>In the end, it simply boils down to the value that we assign to a mind, to a consciousness, soul, whatever you want to call the complete essence of a human being.

I know you weren't serious about the 2GiB lookup table, but if a lookup table in general should be used as a baseline, the benchmark should probably use random access. Do you agree? (Special applications could use a linear access pattern, of course.)<p>(Also, you can shrink the size to 1/8 by just using 1 bit instead of one byte, but that would need some more code of course.)<p>Edit: You can simulate random access by using a stride great enough to avoid the cache.

If you make the distinction between you as a person and your genetic makeup, then there is nothing bad, since whose genes live on Earth in a thousand years is irrelevant, it could be elephants and you would be as happy.<p>If you go down to the DNA level, one might say that it's a bad thing, because DNA's objective is to survive and spread. Just like life itself. If the genetic makeup that makes you European disappears or is less prevalent than it was, then you could say that the DNA you carry did not reach its objective or was less successful in doing so than other groups. Even if the difference between your DNA and that of the group that succeeds is just 0.5%, your European DNA branch split from the other tens of thousands of years ago.<p>You could say now that whatever mutations were acquired during those years failed. Those tens of thousands of years wasted, your most recent ancestors that went through: famines, wars, disease, ice ages, etc.. might just as well have committed suicide and saved themselves the trouble (assuming you're nothing but a thing that carries DNA).<p>Sex is there to help the offspring of two organisms survive. If they replace themselves with 2 children, then that's 50% and 50%, even and fair. What the projection says though is that the DNA of Europeans won't be 50% European in Europe and 50% in immigrant's original countries. It would be much less than that in Europe with current trends and nowhere near in the immigrant's original countries. So you wouldn't be getting that fair share.",1311703254

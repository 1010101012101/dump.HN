261927,comment,261588,261626,0,0,jrockway,,,"Agreed.  Angerwhale (my blogging engine) has a feature for transcluding blog posts from other Angerwhale instances.  So, if you want to comment on something, you can post a blog entry about it and then transclude the post as a comment.  Then the comment thread from your blog becomes a sub-thread in the including blog (and so on recursively).  That way, when you comment on a comment, everything ends up in the right place.  The original post that everyone is replying to is the canonical source for all replies, regardless of whether or not they are ""comments"" or other blog posts.<p>Anyway, this is the Right Way as far as I can tell... but it appears that there are only 4 or 5 people in the world that use Angerwhale.

Watching TV is not a hobby.<p>A hobby is something to which you give sustained effort. Some people claim to be into cooking and have dinner parties, but if you do that less than twice a month I don't think that counts. I realize that many of us have been ruined by modern convenience living and the programmer lifestyle, so it is an effort to get a meal for four or more together. But cooking for other people is supposed to be normal; it's not hobby material.<p>And photography: <i>everybody</i> has a digital camera now. Get real. Unless you have gotten in a vehicle with equipment specifically for the purpose of photographing something and no other reason, you're not really a photographer.<p>I hesitate to call MMOs a hobby. They do meet the definition, but the physical experience -- sitting in front of a computer , collaborating with others in virtual spaces -- is very close to the sort of work most of us do for eight or more hours a day already. I think if you garden or do bicycle couriering, you're allowed to claim that MMOs are your hobby, but otherwise no.<p>Please understand that I'm not condemning anyone, but I think a lot of us are deluding ourselves. We don't want to admit how narrow we are, and how we really spend our leisure time. I'm willing to bet that programmed entertainments, like TV, movies, games, or pornography top the list of actual hours spent. It's sad, because at the age of 80, I don't think anyone's going to look back on their lives and say ""DAMN! If only I had gotten through all my Galactica DVDs...."" Maybe RescueTime should do something about this.<p>As for me: I used to have hobbies, but now I don't. It's a serious problem and I think it contributes to an ongoing low-level depression. I do read an enormous amount, but as stated above, this is not a hobby. It's a really bad situation. I think my hobby is dreaming up startups which, for visa and other reasons, I can't do much about.",1217432771

Take, for example, a strict refactoring of the code, in the sense that only implementation is being changed and no features are being added.  The immediate business value of that action is near zero, but the long term value is more.  What the graphs point out is that, due to manual testing and production environments rigorously stress-testing a particular, perhaps brittle, snapshot of the code, the amount of refactoring and beautification of the codebase required to provide a baseline level of long-term value equivalent to the spike is much higher.  Yes, the code will be cleaner, and easier to maintain and update for the future, and the resulting spikes from testing and production deployment will be that much higher, too.<p>Take a look at the very last graph.  I would posit that once the code is beautified and a more flexible version deployed, non-source readers would see another spike at the end, but from the original spike, it's hard to justify the valley of little incremental value.",1217430227

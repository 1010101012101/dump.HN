901104,comment,900571,900571,0,0,human_v2,,,"I'm kind of against a pharmaceutical regimen for most people. I understand that there are SOME things that people cannot fix themselves, but a lot of the cases, I don't believe drugs are necessary. Let's face it. People take pills because it's easier than eating a healthy diet to make your blood pressure go down.<p>Depression, in my opinion, is something most people can overcome. Rather than looking within and learning about themselves, most people would rather just pop a feel-good pill every morning.<p>And the drugs themselves. They're essentially a bunch of random chemicals that big pharma shoves down the throats of test subjects and looks for good things that could happen. I would rather deal with my mild depression than take pills that could make me nauseous, give headaches, make me bleed from strange places or even kill me. Most people don't weigh the costs and benefits of taking prescription drugs... because it's easier.",1256432219

I have a ton of bandwidth in with bursting and had no choppy video whatsoever. The choppy video might be a bandwidth problem caused by your ISP overloading the node with other residential customers. I know from experience that some do this, and on Saturdays it can really slow things down.<p>I did notice the audio cut out but it was coming in as static so it might have been physical mic problem onsite vs. the actual audio delivery from the server to the client.<p>By the way YCombinator--GREAT JOB with this live broadcast, I loved it, it was GREAT!<p>Launch early and iterate!",1256432173

901100,comment,900571,900873,0,0,drinian,,,"The SSRI-class antidepressants' efficacy also appears to be somewhat linked to genetic factors (despite their all being, in theory, quite similar in action). Zoloft seems to be the only thing besides benzodiapenes that will keep my panic disorder in remission; I chose this drug because a blood relative was already using it successfully to treat much more severe problems.<p>So I can't speak to its effectiveness as an antidepressant, but they can work quite well on anxiety in many cases. I am also taking fish oil supplements to see if that helps improve things further, but I can say that low-dose fish oil for a couple of months on its own wasn't enough for me. From a nootropic standpoint, it might have some benefits regardless.",1256431918

901098,comment,901021,901021,0,0,human_v2,,,"Based on intuition, I think of the universe as a giant cellular automaton. Each state of the universe is a slice of time, which lasts a Planck length of time. Each slice is static, but the loaf of time-bread is dynamic as a hole.  The brain is interesting in that it is capable of storing information from previous slices.<p>The brain, seeing at 13 fps according to TFA, relies on itself to interpolate the things that happen in between frames as well as combining the separate streams into what you perceive as vision.<p>I think the most interesting point the article made was  that your brain operates a different frequencies. While this is not shocking, it does go to show that we can explain the functionality of our brains as a complicated computer system, and our bodies as a mechanical robot that happens to be squishy.<p>Now that we view ourselves as machines, perhaps we can apply more engineering practices for bodily upgrades. Anyone else want to be a cyborg as bad as I do?",1256431816

So no, these stats are not representative of reality.<p>Assuming gemcutter.org does become the preferred source for all gem downloads, it's safe to assume that downloads of Rails (and other known popular gems) will surpass this in due time.

This makes it more like the widget in Wave.   The one in Etherpad continuously follows the horizontal movement of the mouse, and jumps to the nearest discrete change point on mouse up.<p>I like the movement in Etherpad better, though.  I might like it better if both were combined so that the real slider made continuous horizontal movements, and a shadow-pointer made discrete jumps while dragging.",1256430060

It increases wakefulness\helps focused thought but impairs memory. It's a stimulant drug, not a very good stimulant drug, but the most commonly used one with a large social presence.<p>Vastly superior safe legal stimulants imo:
Rhodilia Rosea, L-Tyrosine, Cocoa, Galantamine, Spirulina<p>Others legal ones I know a lot of people swear by:
Piracetam.

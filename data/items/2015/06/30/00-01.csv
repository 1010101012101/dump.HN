9802170,comment,9770722,9784647,0,0,twiceaday,,,"You claim Apples products are dumbed down but the first example you give is that OSX only runs on certain hardware. That&#x27;s not what &quot;dumbed down&quot; means. This goes more towards your point of their products being limited (extremely-limited is still a stretch). But if you think about it their product is Macbook + OSX. This pair is not limited, its as feature rich as any Windows laptop (even more so I&#x27;d argue because of the unix backed OS). The Windows ecosystem indeed has a larger selection of products but your claims were significantly more far reaching than this simple fact.<p>> Here&#x27;s a big one for which there are lots of examples - Apple simply does not let you customize OS X nearly as much as you can customize Windows. Apple&#x27;s dumb-it-down attitude reaches all the way to the smallest of features - for instance, go try and change the color of your mouse cursor in OS X.<p>You escalate the notion of a mouse cursor theme being difficult to change into the entire operating system being difficult to customize. An operating system does a lot of stuff, I don&#x27;t see how any of this follows.<p>> I think it&#x27;s hilarious that some people are so in love with Apple that they don&#x27;t even see the most basic examples.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you think this tiny thing is indicative of, but I guarantee to you that most people have never even thought about this because it is irrelevant to their lives.<p>> And the same arguments go for the iPhone versus others. Apple doesn&#x27;t let you customize it nearly as much as Android and of course they don&#x27;t let you run it on the hardware you want, so yeah the iPhone is dumbed-down. Enjoy your prison yard!<p>To summarize your arguments: Apple provides fewer hardware options and a lot less theming options. Seems to me like your words are a bit too harsh considering you are describing a full desktop operating system and a full mobile operating system, both of which have significantly more knobs to tweak than just themes. They also run software you know. Limiting access to fiddle with themes is hardly a prison yard. Also, not everybody has the time to fiddle with themes. Also, just because something is customizable doesn&#x27;t mean you can make it look good (customizability comes at a cost to coherency). Also, plenty of people use Apple strictly because of how their products look and feel. I think your theming metric is quite weak in general, but especially when used to back up the claims that every single thing Apple makes is &quot;dumbed down&quot; and &quot;extremely limited.&quot;",1435625776

The predominant tool for doing that is to calculate contributions from so called Feynman diagrams, each diagram is a graphical representation of some fairly complicated integral, the integrant is some rational function of the particle momenta. The nominator has to be simplified by manipulating spinor identities and in the case of for example QCD one has to work out color factors. Just a few years before people were computing 1000s of those diagrams by hand for Quantum electro dynamics, often while cross checking each others results. For non-abelian Yang-Mills Theory (t&#x27;Hooft Veltman had published their landmark paper in 1972) this is more or less infeasible beyond first order.<p>The number of diagrams that have to be evaluated quickly explodes beyond the first order and in the case of QCD already at two loops would require herculean efforts to do by hand.

String theory is a mathematical answer that solves some (all?) of the inconsistencies between quantum theory and gravity but has some implications that have no experimental evidence (eg extra dimensions).<p>Dark matter always struck me as a kludge to explain the universe fit our model. There are many theories on it but no observed or experimental effects of dark matter to date.<p>We say that there are four fundamental forces in the universe: weak nuclear, strong nuclear, electromagnetism and gravity. The first three are pretty adequately explained by quantum mechanics (AFAICT). The last of course isn&#x27;t but is described pretty darn well by relativity.<p>Thing is, what&#x27;s always struck me as odd is the other forces, I believe, can both attract and repel. There is no observation or experimental evidence of &quot;antigravity&quot;.<p>It has always made me wonder if we&#x27;re not making an error by trying to fit gravity into the Standard Model.

It can be hard work for a shy or introverted person to deal with the &#x27;social&#x27; moments. One solution is to ration your effort to be sociable...<p>For example, I don&#x27;t feel the need to try hard to be sociable at coffee breaks. Everyone is busy getting coffee, looking at the conference schedule, checking email, etc. It is very normal to not be sociable at coffee breaks, so you can fit in without problem by getting coffee and then finding a comfortable place to sit and just study whatever you want.<p>I almost always skip the &quot;party&quot; if there is one. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.<p>In my opinion, you might want to reserve your main effort for lunch. This is a time when people are resting from going to sessions but are relaxed enough to talk and may have just learned something interesting, too. The two issues here are where to sit, and what to talk about. My advice on where to sit is first of all, do NOT sit at empty table by yourself. This will feel uncomfortable, while waiting to see if anyone will sit there. I also avoid taking the last seat at an almost-full table where everybody is talking. They may be busy with their conversations. I look for a table that has a few people but is perhaps 60% empty. I don&#x27;t sit on the opposite side of the table far away from the people, nor right next to them; I pick a spot that is one or two seats away. As soon as you sit down, shake hands and introduce yourself. Other people will come and fill in the empty seats. It is normal when someone sits down near to you to immediately say hello, and introduce yourself. They will do the same.<p>Fortunately, at a conference, everybody has in common an interest in the subject. This makes it easier converse, using standard questions to begin: &quot;Have you been to this conference before?&quot; &quot;Did you travel far to get to the conference?&quot; &quot;Have you used React a lot?&quot; &quot;What did you think of the keynote speech?&quot; &quot;What does you company do?&quot; If the conversion moves to a technical discussion, you may find it easier to talk.<p>If conversation becomes difficult, you can just listen to what the others at the table are talking about.<p>Also, people are always busy at conferences and running off to take care of tasks or business, so if it is too uncomfortable is OK to finish lunch and leave; you are not trapped!<p>If there is a dinner speaker, then dinner is easy, since most of the time everyone will be listening. After the speaker, conversation can be about what the speaker said.<p>Good luck! There are many people who exactly understand this anxiety and are wishing you the best.",1435624241

Unless you meant that it is extraordinary as a result of extraordinary purchase prices. As a proportion of purchase prices, these rentals are nothing special. Rental prices will lie within a relatively narrow band near the cost of maintaining a mortgage for the simple reason that if they get much higher, people can finance more property purchases and hope to gain on price growth, and if they get much lower, a substantial proportion of investors lose the ability to leverage and so the returns won&#x27;t be attractive.<p>> If you walk through Knightsbridge in the evening, at a time when people in well-adjusted cities might be having dinner with their families and friends, or at least watching TV with their kids, you will see a wall of black, punctuated by the odd square of illumination.<p>Try walking around the wealthiest area of any city, and the patterns will be very different from &quot;normal&quot; areas: Flats will be larger, and someone at home does not necessarily mean the building will look very lit; more people have second homes, or travel a lot, or work late, and so an inhabited flat may still have people at home more rarely. You can easily find rich areas that look almost black even when most houses are occupied.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Knightsbridge is an aberration, but I do know London in general does not in fact have a lot of empty properties in proportion to its size/population.

There is a reasonable argument to be made about scale and proportion; eg, the use of overwhelming capabilities in extremely asymmetric situations. But that doesn&#x27;t negate the utility of those capabilities.<p>The uncomfortable reality is that all things exist naturally in a state of conflict (or &quot;competition&quot;, to put a nicer spin on it). Morality is perhaps the greatest of the human inventions, but being unnatural, it does not exist in a stable equilibrium, and is rather irrelevant (and sometimes damaging) from a survivalist game theoretic perspective. Like capitalism, the rise and fall of nations mirrors Darwinism on a macro scale, so with that in mind, what we&#x27;re seeing here should not be surprising -- it is the struggle for survival playing out over decades and centuries. The morality of an action, on a national scale, is a secondary concern, although it is often invoked if the effect on the nation is at least neutral or positive.<p>So that&#x27;s why the US won&#x27;t launch an outright attack against French industrial interests -- the consequences would be too damaging, not to mention the moral aspects of War Is a Bad Thing -- but has no compunction about stealing industrial secrets or snooping on politicians, where the potential gains outweigh the risks. And vice versa, for every nation that does this.<p>The &quot;rules of the game&quot; are dictated only by self-interest. Is it fair? No. Probably the only way to solve that is to collectively attain (and sustain!) enlightenment.<p>> rest of the world (the people, not necessarily the governments / those in power) considers industrial spying to be a negative activity<p>That is only true when the people/government are not the beneficiaries of the information. In reality, states (and people) will (and arguably, should) take any advantage that&#x27;s given to them. Again, the reasonable argument to be made here is one of scale and proportion, not an absolutist directive of This Should Never Be Done Because It&#x27;s Bad.<p>> &#x27;They do it too&#x27; is such a lame excuse anyway<p>Yes, &quot;they do it too&quot; is a poor justification for anything, but it&#x27;s not really the argument here. The argument is that not doing it would be more damaging to national economic interests. (I hate having to say this, but I feel like it needs to be spelled out, especially on the Internet: this is not me agreeing with anything the US is doing here, only giving a rationale.

They are a team out of Rochester University that is developing a slew of haptic devices. I got to talk to them some and they are a very good group of people that hopefully we can do some work together in the near future.<p>I was there with DCVR [1]. We&#x27;re a social meetup group for entrepreneurs and hobbyists in the Washington DC area centered around virtual reality. We decided to organize and put a booth together to help promote our individual projects, while also trying to grow our local community for our meetups. But otherwise, in regards to my projects, I was there myself.<p>Since you sound like you&#x27;re in the area, please come to our next DCVR meetup. They are a lot of fun and it&#x27;s probably one of the best ways to get involved with VR from scratch right now.<p>[0] <a href=""https://twitter.com/nullspacevr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/nullspacevr</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Virtual-Reality-DCVR/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/Virtual-Reality-DCVR/</a>",1435622819

Abstract:<p>> For about a century, researchers and experimentalists have strived to bring glasses-free 3D experiences to the big screen. Much progress has been made and light field projection systems are now commercially available. Unfortunately, available display systems usually employ dozens of devices making such setups costly, energy inefficient, and bulky. We present a compressive approach to light field synthesis with projection devices. For this purpose, we propose a novel, passive screen design that is inspired by angle-expanding Keplerian telescopes. Combined with high-speed light field projection and nonnegative light field factorization, we demonstrate that compressive light field projection is possible with a single device. We build a prototype light field projector and angle-expanding screen from scratch, evaluate the system in simulation, present a variety of results, and demonstrate that the projector can alternatively achieve super-resolved and high dynamic range 2D image display when used with a conventional screen.<p><a href=""http://web.media.mit.edu/~gordonw/CompressiveLightFieldProjector/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.media.mit.edu/~gordonw/CompressiveLightFieldProje...</a>",1435622796

For example, you might not need api versioning if you only write a SPA application, there is usually some caching on the client also and it seems to increase, the concurrency problems are starting to show up in the clients (promises and callback hell) and sometimes you want to duplicate a lot of the security things to the client to give faster feedback and a more dynamic gui.

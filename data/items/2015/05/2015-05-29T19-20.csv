We’re putting <i>studio-quality</i> masters into the hands of people.’ And he was absolutely right in that respect. Once you made a CD with ones and zeroes it was only a matter of time before that was converted into something that was easily transferable.”&quot;<p>Emphasis mine.<p>Well, the Loudness War fixed that problem right up, didn&#x27;t it?

Yes, you can still buy decent ones - if you pay for the highest-end ones, but available devices have much less capability than they could theoretically have. For instance, were producers to drop sensor market segmentation tactics (you have a phone model A with sensors 1, 2, 5 and an alternative phone B with sensors 2, 4, 6) and equip at least the mid-and-high-end phones with <i>all</i> the sensors, we could treat smartphone as a sensoric platform and develop tools for bigger userbase.<p>But smartphones ain&#x27;t that bad; the older technology, however, is. It&#x27;s hard to buy decent, durable things nowadays - clothes, shoes, tools. Everything is pretty and colorful and has some cool new features, but nothing lasts more than a season of day-to-day use, even though things made decades ago can last a lifetime.<p>I used to think that maybe military has decent hardware, only to realize they&#x27;re a money-making machine now, and vendors cheat on them even more.<p>So I guess the core observation is: as any market matures, it turns into a race to the bottom, and products quickly become as crap as possible but still good enough to make someone buy them.<p>Is there a solution? I don&#x27;t know. Custom-made things is one option, but there&#x27;s less and less businesses doing that for basic things, and I don&#x27;t see how I could get a custom-made smartphone at a reasonable (< $10k) price.",1432928547

There are literally no pro-conservative and no anti-liberal top posts from the past month[1], only libertarian, liberal and anti-conservative. The paradigm or technology platform dramatically favors a very specific demographic, and is ultimately a disservice to democracy by disproportionately favoring that demographic&#x27;s POV. If you fall into that demographic, I imagine it would be very difficult to resist the potential power play to further your own views.<p>I&#x27;ll address it here as I did in my other post...<p>1) If you feel libertarians are not &quot;conservatives&quot; it is because you are a social conservative.

Soon enough I was on it and let me tell you, it is used far more than Instagram and if not more, the same as Whatsapp. It is because you can share real moment of your normal everyday life. They mentioned how on Instagram most of the pictures they see there are uploaded celebrities/funny accounts/etc. Normal people don&#x27;t have amazing moments to share everyday. Plus, they would be embarrassed to share what they share on Snapchat in any other network (i.e. funny faces, what you cooked, the funny kid on the school bus, your boredom).<p>I believe they are in unchartered territory thus comparing it to anything else is just a shot in the dark. If you could wave a magic wand and ask for the best way to share moments of your life you would probably get a hologram of your friends to show them that instant of you life that you wanted to share. Snapchat gets closest to this. Moments come and go, not all moments should be forever saved, moments should be only for those you intend to share with, moments should be feel lively (video/images) not text, etc.<p>Also: 
Discovery feature - I give Snapchat so much credit for this. They got the younger demographic watching &#x27;TV&#x27; again. Snapchat accommodated the channel these kids are using (mobile) to connect with the big media outlets in a way that they actually consume content. That is, by short clips of < 5-10 minutes.",1432928373

Looks like DARPA is funding MIT, now that Google bought Boston Dynamics and stopped taking DoD contracts.<p>Not sure why they chose a pronk gait, except that they&#x27;re doing all straight line work.  A gallop has more turn options, but roll control is easier for the pronk.

The commercial payoff is a long way ahead.<p>Academic projects rarely have the funding and staff to get beyond the demo level.  You need some big assets, like machine shops and skilled machinists.

In particular:<p><pre><code>    6 = 2 * 3 = (1 + sqrt(-5)) * (1 - sqrt(-5))
</code></pre>
and each of 2, 3, 1 + sqrt(-5) and 1 - sqrt(-5) are irreducible in Z[sqrt(-5)] (ie they don&#x27;t have any other factors other than 1 or -1). This is in opposition to what happens in the integers, namely unique factorization of any integer (other than 0, 1, or -1) into primes.<p>The failed proof mentioned above hinged on the following assumption: if p is a prime and<p><pre><code>    r_p = cos( 2 * pi / p) + i * sin( 2 * pi / p)
</code></pre>
is a primitive p^th root of unity, then the ring of algebraic integers<p><pre><code>    Z[r_p] = {a_0 + a_1 * r_p + a_2 * (r_p)^2 + ... + a_(p-1) * (r_p)^(p-1) | a_0, a_1, ... , a_(p-1) are integers}

They could get more backers if DRM-free release (for everyone) was a simple part of the base goal. I.e. selling DRM-free as a perk only reduces the number of their backers. I only support those projects which have a clear DRM-free release stated in their goals.

To help, I wrote an essay illustrating the security levels offered at various points in spectrum of open vs closed source here:<p><a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/05/friday_squid_bl_424.html#c6051639"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/05/friday_squid_...</a><p>Here&#x27;s what it takes to assure systems at every layer (skip to &quot;the essence of security&quot; para):<p><a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/essay_on_fbi-ma.html#c1102869"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/essay_on_fbi-...</a><p>That&#x27;s what secure takes against even black hats these days. It can be simplified with a strong TCB, better hardware, and better languages + toolchains. The problem is that only a tiny few projects in FOSS are doing that and not many more in commercial. Whitelisting, stack canaries, AV, firewalls... this is all just added complexity around the root problem that hackers bypass regularly. It isn&#x27;t security except against the incompetent.<p>Getting the real thing might require throwing away a lot of code or apps. Or virtualizing it on secure architectures with crazy good interface protections. That&#x27;s why market as a whole won&#x27;t do it. Good news is there&#x27;s small players making such things: eg Turaya Desktop, GenodeOS, CheriBSD, Secure64 SourceT.

There was a documentary that came out last year called <i>I Dream of Wires</i> about analog modular synthesizers, which are going through a renaissance right now thanks to low-cost short-run manufacturing and a much wider audience for electronic music than existed during the previous modular heyday of the 1970s. So they raised lots of money on Kickstarter, and one of the rewards for backers was <i>exclusive</i> access to a 4 hour Blu-Ray copy, with tons of additional footage that would be cut out of the theatrical version, but which you would certainly want to watch if this was your particular nerd obsession. Anyway, the film got made OK, but (as is very typical) the producers vastly overestimated likely interest in the film and discovered the hard way that it was too niche of a subject to appeal to regular documentary distributors. Having gone a bit over budget and spent some personal money to get it finished, they naturally wanted to break even, so after what they thought was a decent interval, they started selling the extended 4-hour Blu-ray edition to the general public on their website.<p><i>Bad idea.</i> The people who had bought that thinking they were getting something exclusive were furious, and stalked the filmmakers across every electronic music forum where they popped their heads up, calling them fraudsters and thieves. They weren&#x27;t any worse, off, as such; they had got their Blu-Rays (although I think they had to wait a long time for them, as with many Kickstarter campaigns that fall way behind schedule), and they included all the promised content delivered to a professional standard. But they thought they had bought a limited edition, and threatened the makers with lawsuits - the result being that the DVD release got pushed way back and the extended &#x27;ahrdcore edition&#x27; has had the price jacked up to $199 (which almost nobody will ever spend) in line with the donation requirement for the original reward.",1432926901

Nevertheless, Java allocation/collection of short-lived object is much closer in cost to stack allocation than to malloc/free.",1432926122

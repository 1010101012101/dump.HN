I pushed hard to have work carved out and I self managed my schedule and deliverables.

They said I had to use their equipment and be integrated to their team.

9735791,comment,9731972,9734006,0,0,antics,,,"I am employed at MSFT. This post (currently the top post) is factually incorrect on basically every level, both on subjects that look good for the company, and on subjects that don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m stepping in to correct this because it&#x27;s better that people understand honestly where we are and aren&#x27;t doing well, then it is to have ridiculous rumors spread by people who shouldn&#x27;t talk about what they don&#x27;t understand.<p>Bing is under Qi Lu, full stop. Lu is very senior VP who reports directly to Satya Nadella. Bing is NOT split among Qi and 4 of his VP peers. It IS true that Lu has split the responsibilities of managing Bing up among SOME of his direct reports, almost all of whom are themselves VPs. But the idea that there is no real &quot;Bing org&quot; anymore is just completely and totally wrong. They all answer to Lu, and they&#x27;ve split responsibilities along sensible boundaries, so that things like UX are under one VP and infrastructure is under another VP.<p>Second, Bing does not have 20% market share &quot;plus&quot; Yahoo&#x27;s market share. Bing <i>and MSFT properties like MSN</i> have 20% market share. Yahoo has 12%. You can&#x27;t just credit Bing with Yahoo&#x27;s market share. That&#x27;s a search experience they work hard on, and the fact that Bing powers Yahoo is largely immaterial to their consumers, who come to Yahoo for the <i>Yahoo experience</i>. They could switch to Google tomorrow and the vast majority of consumers would not notice or care. Truthfully, the biggest (and arguably only real) benefit for Bing is the increased ad revenue.<p>Third, Bing IS profitable. This is well-known and reported on.<p>Fourth, it is basically completely untrue that &quot;nobody&quot; buys Bing ads. Obviously it would not be profitable if that were true. Furthermore, the supposition that you should buy ads based on market share of the search engine is <i>hilariously</i> wrong. You should purchase ads on the platform where they will be more successful. A lot of times this is Google; sometimes this is Bing. The fact that the parent got this wrong basically indicates that they are not to be trusted on this subject, at all. If the poster doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about here, it&#x27;s better to just stop talking then it is to provide information that is wrong or harmful to people listening in.",1434581480

To do this, you have to take actions that drive wider social change, not simply optimize your organization.<p>(If you optimize at the organization level, you end up taking advantage of existing social biases, which is why those subcultures are heavily dominated by the male majority.)To fix this, organizations must not optimize within the existing social biases, but attempt to shift the social biases to that their optimizations are aligned with a merit based-society.<p>In other words, if you want to hit your target, you have to account for gravity and aim up a little.",1434581345

Second, I&#x27;m not sure that &quot;epistemological methods&quot; correspond very well to the physical world, either.  (I mean, yes, in one sense it&#x27;s something humans do in their heads, so it&#x27;s part of biology, so it&#x27;s part of the physical world, but that seems like a bit more than what we usually mean by &quot;the physical world&quot;.)<p>More that that, though, we don&#x27;t think of everything as physics.

Only on access, background scrubs, via API request, etc.<p>Donut also does data integrity checks on a regular basis as an operational process, where even silent data corruption is fixed automatically without the need for any user intervention.<p>We are in early stage of our project, as of today Donut is experimental - currently runs on a single node, does sha256 sums for erasured chunks and erasure codes your data on disk.<p>Much of the operational process and distributed donut is a work in progress, we are planning to get them ready by end of this year.<p>> Which strong hashes are used for all of the above?

Not being limited to that we are also working towards building a continous integration testing framework which would be baked into the product, which would help any user perform self diagnostics of his/her setup. In-turn generating reports for quality of their setup, any unknown parameters which might show up etc.<p>Also testing is an ongoing process, so we are striving to be better everyday :-)<p>Thanks for the questions, feel free to hop on to - gitter.im/minio/minio and find us there.",1434580998

In that case, wasm will be nothing but a Coffeescript-like facade over Javascript semantics, and anyone targeting wasm is really only writing Javascript in an inefficient way, and Javascript is the only first-class language, forever.<p>If wasm is <i>already intended</i> to be crippled relative to Javascript, it really throws into question why wasm should exist at all. When the response to eventually implementing Javascript on top of browser wasm support is &quot;dream on,&quot; like because Javascript on top of wasm will suck because it leaves too much performance on the table, that raises the question of why we think building on top of wasm will be acceptable for languages other than Javascript. If building on top of wasm is unacceptable for Javascript, why isn&#x27;t it unacceptable for everyone else?<p>Maybe this also throws into question whether any discussions supposedly shaping the development of a new cross-vendor standard are really in good faith, if the reality will be that nothing new is made other than a new spelling of Javascript, and that wasm will be forever steered by Javascript and incapable of meaningfully hosting an implementation of Javascript because it has been intentionally crippled to require an implementation of Javascript.<p>Anyone who wants wasm to become a real thing has to be cautious that it is not crippled in order to prevent it from being <i>capable</i> of replacing Javascript (whether it actually does replace Javascript is another issue which can really only be asked if we assume wasm is not already sabotaged to be incapable of that).",1434580751

The biggest hurdle I had to learning to code was finding a text editor.  The next big hurdle I had was finding somewhere to host my one-page HTML site.  I ended up asking a friend who suggested Sublime Text and Amazon AWS.  At that point I&#x27;d been reading HN for two years and had heard of these things, but not understood their central utility (or the utility of similar such general services) to doing anything with code.  This is the level of beginner that I would hope zedshaw&#x27;s efforts would target, someone like me from last year.<p>I want to emphasize that while learning abstract functions, and understanding that code syntax is an abstraction for electrons moving through logic gates are fundamental concepts for an early programmer, learning those concepts was less frustrating for me than finding somewhere to write the text I had learned from codecademy.  I am a chemist by formal training, I took an extremely abstract multivariable calc course in college that taught me Big and Little O, and functionalized concepts most people learn by rote &quot;drills,&quot; and I consider learning new concepts my strongest career skill.  I don&#x27;t mean to humblebrag here, but rather to refute the only-somewhat-popular sentiment I&#x27;ve seen on HN that non-coders &quot;can&#x27;t get shit done.&quot;  No.  I am a non-coder that does shit.  In moving from chemistry to neurobiology and biophysics, there are basic skills that can&#x27;t be found in a textbook, like _this is a pipette_, and _this is a flask to grow cells_, and if you don&#x27;t know those things you won&#x27;t be able to do experiments, and you&#x27;ll fail the informal subtext of an interview.  The best resource I&#x27;ve found in (three years of reading HN anonymously) for analogous tool-teaching in code has been Michael Hartl&#x27;s book on learning Rails, so thanks again mhartl!  The first two chapters of that resource were more treacherous (but ultimately well-guided and successful) than teaching myself d3.js.

9735641,comment,9730944,9735576,0,0,eridius,,,"Several reasons:<p>1. You can&#x27;t intercept the request to Dropbox itself, because that doesn&#x27;t contain any secret data. You&#x27;d need to intercept the response, and you can&#x27;t fake the UI for that app because it would be immediately apparent to even the most cursory inspection that your app is not in fact the app that made the request (even if you perfectly mirrored their UI, you wouldn&#x27;t have any of their data so you couldn&#x27;t replicate what their app is actually showing). And anyone who looks at the app switcher would see your app there so you can&#x27;t possibly hide the fact that you launched at that time.<p>2. Even if you could be 100% convincing, you can&#x27;t actually pass the data to the real app when you&#x27;re done recording it because, by virtue of overriding their URL handler, you&#x27;ve made it <i>impossible</i> to invoke the real app&#x27;s URL handler. There&#x27;s no way on iOS to specify which app you&#x27;re trying to open a URL in. All you can do is pass the URL to the system and it will open the app it thinks is correct. Since you overrode their URL handler, if you try and call it, you&#x27;ll just be calling yourself again. And since you&#x27;ve now made their URL handler inaccessible, you&#x27;ve cut off the only possible way to pass that data to the real app (even if it has other URL handlers, they won&#x27;t accept the same data).<p>So the end result is that if you do try and take over someone else&#x27;s URL handler, it&#x27;ll be blindingly obvious the moment you actually intercept a request.<p>The only approach that even seems semi-plausible would be attempting to phish the user by presenting a login UI as if you were Dropbox and hoping they enter their username/password, but the problem with that is the entire point of calling out to a separate app is that you&#x27;re already logged-in to that app, so if the user is presented with a login form at all, they should instantly be suspicious. And of course as already mentioned you can&#x27;t hide the fact that you intercepted the request, so you&#x27;ll be caught the first time you ever do this.<p>On a related note, even if you can make a perfectly convincing UI, your launch image will still give you away as being the wrong app (since the user will see your launch image as the app is launched). Unless you make your launch image look like the app you&#x27;re trying to pretend to be, but then you can&#x27;t possibly pretend to be a legitimate app because the user has to actually install your app to begin with, which means they&#x27;ll be looking at it. If they install some random app from the app store and it has a launch image that looks like, say, Dropbox, that&#x27;s a dead giveaway that it&#x27;s shady. There&#x27;s not really any way to disguise an app like that.",1434579231

If you are often querying for logins, you may think that you should instead make the partition key = (firstName, loginTime), but that would leave your data in an almost irretrievable state since you would need to know the exact login times. It would also leave you looking at multiple partitions in every query, which isn&#x27;t as performance as a single partition.<p>A better partition key would be (firstName, dayAndHourOfLoginTime) so your partitions would be for each first name and each hour.

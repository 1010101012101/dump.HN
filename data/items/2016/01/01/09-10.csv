If you&#x27;re asking and you are dealing with financial transactions or ad networks, well, you&#x27;re asking in the wrong place and you should probably hire someone that knows how BGP anycasting works.<p>Eh, usually you just bgp anycast the DNS server.  If you anycast just your DNS server, you are pretty much in the same pickle as if you host your dns with someone else who runs a reliable dns server (and have them do the anycast)  - the pickle is that there&#x27;s a minimum ttl.<p>Now you <i>can</i> set up a redirector server and anycast that, and like 3xx redirect all your requests (or more often just the first request)  and that&#x27;s better, really, &#x27;cause that redirect can be changed quickly and on a per-request (or more often per-session) basis... but while I know a thousand companies that will sell you anycast DNS service, I don&#x27;t know anyone who will sell someone with a vps customer budget an anycast&#x27;d redirector service.",1451642398

It used to be a browser that had everything plus the kitchen sink, it was blazing fast, and really small (both in executable size and in RAM). It managed to keep that way for many years, constantly improving and packing more useful features while keeping the small footprint, I&#x27;d say until version 10 or so. Versions 11 and 12 starting removing features and introducing bloat, and then after version 12 the browser was switched to Blink and became a Chrome clone that didn&#x27;t have even a quarter of the features of the previous versions.<p>I think probably one (not the only) reason for this was the &quot;reconciling all the new standards and external mishmashes&quot; you mention, but how does that make the weight less gratuitous? It only means that the blame is not exclusively on Opera but also on other companies, committees, etc., but it doesn&#x27;t make the phenomenon any less ludicrous and sad.",1451642270

A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a liberal-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C., found that more than a third of recent computer science graduates aren’t working in their chosen major; of that group, almost a third say the reason is that there are no jobs available.<p>> And yet, alongside such dire projections, you’ll also find reports suggesting just the opposite—that there are more STEM workers than suitable jobs. One study found, for example, that wages for U.S. workers in computer and math fields have largely stagnated since 2000.<p><a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/10/12/silicon-valley-diversity-tech-hiring-computer-science-graduates-african-american-hispanic/14684211/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/10/12/silicon-valley...</a><p>> SAN FRANCISCO – Top universities turn out black and Hispanic computer science and computer engineering graduates at twice the rate that leading technology companies hire them, a USA TODAY analysis shows.<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myt...</a><p>> A compelling body of research is now available, from many leading academic researchers and from respected research organizations such as the National Bureau of Economic Research, the RAND Corporation, and the Urban Institute. No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelors degrees or higher, although some are forecasting high growth in occupations that require post-high school training but not a bachelors degree.<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/civil-engineers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/civil-en...</a>\n> $82,050 per year<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electric...</a>\n> $93,260 per year<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/c...</a>\n> $77,550 per year<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/chemical-engineers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/chemical...</a>\n> $96,940 per year<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedical-engineers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedic...</a>\n> $86,950 per year<p>All you&#x27;ve really shown is CS has matured to the point where a good software engineer is on par with other engineering fields in terms of business value and their salary is starting to reflect that.

If I would play against someone strong on openings but a weak player otherwise make an irrational opening move totally upsetting their apple-carts. If they were strong players they&#x27;d take advantage but if they were only strong on book knowledge you&#x27;d take them to the cleaners. Knowing your opponent in chess can be as important as knowing the game.",1451639163

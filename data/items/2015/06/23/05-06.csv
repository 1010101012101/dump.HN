Non professional college programs are explicitly not vocational training. If they were, they wouldn&#x27;t require spending nearly half your time on general education requirements (assuming we&#x27;re talking about the US here). I doubt art history, physics, or psychology has proven much direct use to you in your career.<p>>In fact, some of the academic stuff like compilers and automata have been useless in real life. That&#x27;s a failing of academia from my point of view.<p>Finite state machines and pushdown automata are an incredibly common pattern, and I can&#x27;t see how you can work as a professional software developer without running into that pattern time and again. Have you never used regular expressions?<p>Automata (usually taught along with theory of computation) teaches you all kinds of useful real world knowledge, like why you can&#x27;t parse HTML with regular expressions, and why you can&#x27;t write a program to tell if another program will eventually halt.",1435039176

Gox Co. exchange, where Silk Road bitcoins were stored, and its owner’s bank accounts two days after he had taken his own money out of it, according to the criminal complaint.<p>this couple of bad FBI apples obviously can&#x27;t cast any doubt onto the integrity of the rest of the FBI Silk Road team (consisting mainly of pure-breed white knights in shiny Lexuses) nor onto the integrity of the whole investigation and conviction....... The trial was 3 ring circus beyond reasonable doubt. F&cking clowns. It isn&#x27;t the issue whether DPR was this guy or not, or whether he really hired a killer. The issue is that my taxes are extorted from me in order to, supposedly, finance justice process, and what i&#x27;ve got for my money was a show so lame that it wasn&#x27;t worth even a rotten tomato to throw at it.<p>In the light of the so far surfaced crimes by the FBI agents the epic heroic story <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-2/</a> looks like a new story:<p>&quot;DPR believed that Nob was a Puerto Rican cartel middleman named Eladio Guzman, but he was in fact DEA agent Carl Force. Force had spent more than a year developing his undercover identity on Silk Road in an effort to get close to DPR. They’d become confidants, spending nights chatting at such length that DPR trusted Nob when he needed enforcement muscle.<p>It was Nob whom DPR hired to kill his employee, Curtis Green. Force then coerced Green into faking his own death as a ruse. Force was surprised to see DPR’s moral collapse up close, but then again, he’d seen this kind of thing before, during his younger DEA years in undercover. He too had experienced the temptations that came with a double identity. In fact, his secret life as a hard-partying operator had nearly destroyed his regular life. He’d left all that behind and recommitted himself to Christ. The Silk Road case was his first undercover role since those days, and it was a big one. Because of his tenure online as Nob, Force was able to carry out the supposed “hit” on Green, setting DPR up for a murder conspiracy indictment while at the same time cementing their relationship. Nob and DPR had become comrades-in-arms.&quot;<p>I mean, obviously, this heroic Force whose court testimonies and affidavits sent the guy for life couldn&#x27;t be the same Force who stole the money. I mean we&#x27;re talking about commitment to Christ after all... Did i mention clowns?<p>And this one is the icing - <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahjeong/2015/03/31/force-and-bridges/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahjeong/2015/03/31/force-and-...</a>:<p>&quot;A state’s witness took the fall for an agent’s theft, thus becoming the target for a murder-for-hire—a murder that was then faked by the same agent. The Silk Road case was compromised again and again as Force and Bridges allegedly took every opportunity to embezzle and steal money. With so much bitcoin on their hands, the two had to coax various bitcoin and payments companies to help convert their ill-gotten gains to dollars. When companies resisted, investigations were launched, subpoenas were issued, and civil forfeitures were sought in retaliation.&quot;",1435039091

9762842,comment,9762062,9762794,0,0,userbinator,,,"True, it&#x27;s not <i>always</i> possible because there are certain constrained cases where the value in a fixed destination register immediately needs to go to a fixed source one, but from my experience a lot of cases have intervening operations that don&#x27;t need a fixed source/dest, and yet the compiler didn&#x27;t arrange things so that the results of preceding operations naturally went to the right place as the instruction came up, but instead had to generate a MOV. I suppose it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a certain amount of &quot;working backwards&quot; (alternatively, &quot;looking ahead&quot;) that&#x27;s required, and traditional code generation techniques don&#x27;t consider this case. A good human programmer would think &quot;I&#x27;ll need to divide, so I should compute the dividend in eax&quot; or &quot;there&#x27;s a shift coming up, so the computation leading up to the shift amount should use ecx&quot;.<p>Calling conventions are similar (e.g. eax needs to be the return value), so you see things like this:<p><pre><code>    mov ecx, [ebp+16]\n    add ecx, edx\n    mov eax, ecx  ; superfluous move\n    ret\n</code></pre>\nwhen this could&#x27;ve been done instead:<p><pre><code>    mov eax, [ebp+16]\n    add eax, edx\n    ret</code></pre>",1435038962

Find every ELF binary in /usr/bin<p>2. Use objdump to disassemble the text sections<p>3. Grep for what the commands probably are (not 100% accurate, since some constant data (e.g., switch tables) gets inlined into the text section, and some nop sequences get mangled)<p>4. Build a histogram of the instructions, and then print the results<p>I don&#x27;t bother to try to handle the different sizes of types (particularly for nop, which can be written in several different ways to align the next instruction on the right boundary). The result is this list:<p><pre><code>  117336056 Total\n  43795946 mov\n  9899354 callq\n  7128602 lea\n  5258131 test\n  4928828 cmp\n  4463038 jmpq\n  3879175 pop\n  3628965 jne\n  3519259 add\n  3227188 xor\n  2824699 push\n  2361085 nopl\n  2016346 sub\n  1678131 and\n  1551014 movq\n  1311683 jmp\n  1311476 retq\n  1255216 nopw\n  1239479 movzbl\n  1234815 movl\n  946434 movb\n  663852 shr\n  614367 shl\n  581608 cmpb\n  523398 movslq\n  427116 pushq\n  384794 cmpq\n  376695 jbe\n  348158 movsd\n  341248 testb\n  340718 sar\n  338542 xchg\n  311171 data16\n  302296 jle\n  266539 movzwl\n  252872 cmpl\n  210762 jae\n  169823 lock\n  152724 addq\n  151186 sete\n  147340 cmove\n  146501 imul\n  146386 setne\n  145233 movabs\n  142801 repz\n  123489 cmovne\n  123439 addl\n  105156 pxor\n  81745 cmpw\n\n</code></pre>\nSince this is Debian Linux, nearly every binary is compiled with gcc. The push and pop instructions are therefore relatively rare (since they tend not to be used to set up call instructions, just mov&#x27;s to the right position on rbp/rsp). jmpq and pushq are way overrepresented thanks to the PLT relocations (2 jmpq, 1 pushq per PLT entry).<p>mov&#x27;s are very common because, well, they mean several different things in x86-64: set a register to a given constant value, copy from one register to another, load from memory into a register, store from a register into memory, store a constant into memory... Note, too, that several x86 instructions require particular operands to be in particular registers (e.g., rdx/rax for div, not to mention function calling conventions).<p>If you&#x27;re curious, the rarest instructions I found were the AES and CRC32 instructions.",1435037905

Then think about writing plugins for git, for colorful prompts, for autocomplete, for common development tasks etc. Since rc language is easier and cleaner than bash - writing plugins and extensions for it should be easier. Of course, many blog posts must be written showing how superior it can be comparing to bash in some cases and how easier it is to learn. Once the resulting rc gets into every linux distro and mac and there will be known repositories like ohmyzsh - people may start switching from bash to rc, not from bash to zsh.<p>2) For embedded systems - from my experience sh scripting is normally done not for the desktop, but for tiny embedded systems, where busybox is a definite winner - maybe an alternative can be made by using rc shell and Plan 9 set of utilities? So we get a single static binary (again, rewrite rc in Go?) and a small set of tools, that might even work on windows. I think it could be smaller, like toybox, but with a usable shell interpreter.<p>Since most implementations of rc are now unmaintained (correct if I&#x27;m wrong) - probably it would be better to rerite it in some modern language (Go, Rust, maybe C++), cover with tests and start promoting it. If so - I would be happy to join the development (I started it once, ended up with just yacc-generated AST parser, but I though it might become a huge project that nobody is interested in, so I suspended the development).",1435037215

E.g. using if (x mod 15 == 0) in fizzbuzz.  The problem with this kind of cleverness is that it&#x27;s hard to understand the code, and it breaks whenever the conditions it relies on stop holding.<p>The second kind of more subtle.  It is where you organize code to properly express the nature of the problem, but this organization is itself conceptually complex.  A typical example is using C++ templates where they make logical sense, but they make the code that much harder to read.<p>The second kind is where balance is needed most.  If you use too little cleverness (or maybe too much humility), you end up with spaghetti code, or code where all the organization is done via convention instead of enforced by the compiler.

They are quite unique because they are capable of actions that look like violations of the second law - e.g. you can quite easily reverse a program that simulates gas diffusion, and simulate putting that gas back in a jar - that is, you can define an incredibly delicate system, and reset it for nothing, like being able to use a kitchen for anything and then clean it instantly, for free.

Coupling signals across time is, I believe, what programming is about.

But only useful distinction is between signals that arise from outside the system, and those which arise inside (that is, <i>programming</i> and <i>input</i> are the same; but input arising from <i>results of a function call</i> are profoundly different). It&#x27;s useful because only the latter can recurse, which is both a source of error, but also the only possible way &quot;intelligence&quot; (or any really complicated behavior) could possibly express. The only other thing that matters is the shape of the system state - which constrains, in some ways, the kinds of states the system can achieve (or, because it&#x27;s a universal machine, it constrains the general patterns of state traversal in some hand-wavy sense).<p>I built something that demonstrates these ideas, if anyone&#x27;s interested.",1435036697

I agree that ""entitlement"" can create unhappiness with that output.<p>Getting away from PG's essay, there could be options other than to accept that output - we could change the input, and not necessarily selling out our 'doing love' for 'market love'.<p>The 'doing love' could be a set (not a single thing).

I've known great developers (a few of which have written code <i>every</i> Python developer uses every day) who've made their employment decisions based on how they'll be treated, who they'll be working with, and with what tools they'll be working (and even what they'll be working on....Open Source development has a strong allure for many developers, beyond mere money).  Aeron chairs have a reputation for being a ""boom era boondoggle"", but if you don't provide a good chair, you won't keep a good developer sitting for long.  Great recent hardware to work on is a given.  Big monitors, a given.  Whatever software and hardware they need to be comfortable: trackball or fancy mouse, weird keyboard, monitor stand, etc.  Likewise for snacks and their favorite beverages.<p>As a startup, I'm running cheap.  But, when it comes time to hire folks, I'm stocking the damned fridge with the best stuff money can buy, buying great chairs and huge monitors, and anything else I can to make working for me and with me the best work experience of their lives.  Even if it costs $5000-$7500 right off the bat to equip a developer, that's chump change compared to the opportunity cost of hiring a new one to replace him if he leaves.  And it's a small percentage of their total compensation package.

But we don't understand normal peoples problems, because they are not our problems. Our best shot is at the common stuff(communication is the most common) In this case we are trapped. We can search for ordinary peoples problems and solve them with software, but those are not our problems and we don't understand them. How are we to know if we are not solving it wrongly? Or if we are solving a completely different problem in a really messed up way? So here is my best shot at it. Get a boring job, get married, have kids and get stupid. Have problems and then get smart again, get divorced and start working to solve the problem.

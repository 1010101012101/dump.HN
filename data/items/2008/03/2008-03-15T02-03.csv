Self-discipline isn't exactly the same as ability to concentrate, but as a simple indicator for young children its interesting to study.",1205548781
137340,comment,136364,137251,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I never said anything about resetting variables, and in fact, I emphatically mentioned copying the stack by way of clarification.  I'm surprised you would misinterpret me to be saying anything about resetting variables.  I'll try to refrain from using ""state"" in the future, when speaking to someone that could be from a functional programming background, since it seems to be so easy to misinterpret as ""variables"".  I wasn't aware anyone used the term ""state"" to mean ""variables"", but I come from a C-derived lineage, and may have missed that memo.<p>I'll also try to refrain from commenting in language weenie threads.  It's not my forte.",1205548776

I knew plenty of similar people, some of whom were diagnosed with things like ADHD.<p>I'm not saying all children are good at concentration. I doubt most of the kids who stand still well are very good at concentration. It's just not what is being tested for and not what schools really care about.",1205547963

137331,comment,137006,137263,0,0,kalid,,,"Yeah, there's lots of different interpretations for the average. The predictive one works well (expected value), another one is where the ""balancing point"" would be if you had  physical weights at those coordinates.<p>If you had 1kg weights at distances 2 3 and 10 (sum of 15), you should put the fulcrum of a lever at 5 to keep the set balanced. (Torque on right: 10 - 5 = 5. Torque on left: 5 - 2 = 3, and 5 - 3 = 2, for a total of 5).<p>Different sized masses? You literally take the weighted average :).",1205547872
137330,comment,137244,137244,0,0,ephextom,,,"I've had a bit of insight into this, through some exposure to a program that attempts to treat ADHD, Aspergers and Dyslexia.  The program is based on the premise that these conditions are caused by an underdeveloped cerebellum, and provides a program of exercises that are specifically designed to develop this part of the brain.<p>One of the tests they do in diagnosis and progress assessment is a basic ""standing still"" test, performed on a platform with computer-monitored sensors, and several of the exercises involve simply standing as still as possible for a few minutes.<p>They find that over the 12-24 months the candidate participates in the program, as their ability to stand still increases, the extent to which they suffer from these conditions diminishes.<p>As I'm sure many here would attest, people with ADHD, AS and Dyslexia often have above-average IQ scores, but struggle with school performance or endeavors that require similar strengths, like conventional office jobs.",1205547674

137327,comment,137244,137325,0,0,greendestiny,,,"It depends on whether they failed to stand still because they simply didn't want to follow orders or because they couldn't. Not really enough information to judge on in this article, but I believe that its because they couldn't based on what I know of kids. Your romantic notion of these individualistic children who'd rather be concentrating on something else just doesnt gel with my experience with kids. In general they're eager to please, especially in a one off situations.",1205547391

137323,comment,137244,137317,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I found the fact that something predicts school success better than IQ very interesting considering about all IQ predicts well is school success. For me it really confirmed the idea that what IQ measures isn't as fundamental a representation of cognitive ability as I grew up believing. I realise psychologists have moved onto a notion of 'g' but they still assume its highly correlated with IQ.<p>I strongly disagree with your assessment of the rest of the article, it seems like you're trying hard to fit it in to a particular world view. Concentration is not obedience, its vastly more important, and I don't think the lack of concentration shown was simply as a result of the childrens new aversion to obedience (if such a thing exists).",1205546685

(I suspect that my coworkers would've done so too, except that many of them also mumble to themselves while programming.)",1205546631

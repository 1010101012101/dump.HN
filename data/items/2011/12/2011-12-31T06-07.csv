It's meant to eliminate pointless arguments about what is or isn't germane to the site, much like how you're asked not to comment about being downvoted. But flags are invisible, and the number of people flagging is dwarfed by the number of people upvoting threads about Ron Paul's newsletters, so that the only way for it to leave the front page of the site (precipitously, if you didn't notice) is admin intervention.<p>Commenting on this post in the first place was stupid, since the story already got buried.

3410369,comment,3410133,3410190,0,0,nicholasreed,,,"I agree completely. My first thought after reading this article was that while 99% of users may not view the source of a page, the 1% (web devs) that actually create additional pages find View Source, Firebug, etc. extremely useful. When I'm helping any new web developer out one of my first steps is to have them use and understand Firebug. Preaching to the choir here, but it cannot be understated how important access to and readability of source code was to me when I first began.<p>Compiling and delivering in an unreadable format is possibly the worst solution to this problem. Who ends up benefiting from this? The end user who saves a minuscule amount of time loading the page? Is hampering innovation and progress really worth that amount of time?<p>Below, the author makes a point that viewing the actual source is unreadable anyways. Very true, but tools like Firebug and Chrome Developer Tools help combat that problem to an extent by nicely formatting HTML, CSS, JS, etc. And while many large sites (Gmail, etc.) have compact and utterly horrendous source, I would argue that novice developers are not looking there first for help, instead they look at less complex sites that are not minified (because they don't need to increase page loading speed).",1325314273

Viewable source can’t be anywhere near the biggest reason for web applications’ popularity. On Occam’s Razor, I’d bet anything it’s just because the web is a ubiquitous, semistandard platform that’s all interconnected (relatively) seamlessly.<p>The “publicly viewable example code” isn’t helpful at all as-is. Discoverability already sucks. Just sending the source through a pretty-printer would be solving the problem backward, but if you’re going to do that, then there’s still no real reason the source itself has to be transmitted. If we had a single, standard, compiled format, then we’d solve the transmission and parsing problems, and the format could be presented on <i>many</i> different media, of which “decompilation” to HTML would be just one.<p>I’m not saying it wouldn’t be a lot of work to get it right, but in my opinion the benefits would outweigh the costs. That’s why I wrote the article.

Yes, there's a lot of work and headache that's involved with dealing with massive retail systems, and they have about as much legacy stuff as you'd imagine a 150-year-old company with a history of giant acquisitions, but thankfully most of us never have to think about that stuff except at the edge of some giant diagram.<p>We have a whole bunch of floors in downtown SF that's just for dotcom--mostly engineers, some QA, some product/management, etc. We're reasonably up to date with new technologies--although we're a Java shop, some stuff gets done in Scala, there's an active Hadoop project, and lots of big, interesting problems in scalability, UX, big data, analytics, SEO, etc.<p>Example: I work on the internal-facing web product setup apps, primarily on product image stuff. Every product has to get photographed (including getting the physical sample from the manufacturer to the right studios, on the right model, etc), color corrected (we sell items in 60+ colors) mapped to products (is this the primary image? a swatch? a back view? which UPCs does it represent? what happens if the color sells out?). This all happens at scale: 130k physical samples trafficked, 150k products, 250k images.<p>Too bad this is on a weekend before new year's, otherwise I'd get all my favorite dev leaders in here to pitch you. We're growing (even in a down economy, we're posting significant growth year after year) and hiring like crazy (a current search shows 25 open FTE requisitions in SF, and our contract partners even more).<p>The work environment is a little BigCorp-ish, but it's relaxed (it's SF, after all), and they take work/life balance seriously, so if you're a hacker with a family you're definitely welcome here. I work with a lot of really smart people who get things done.

First off, I assume you meant to derive SharedBFactory from SharedAFactory?  Otherwise, it works fine.<p>If not, the only problem here is that C++ won't let you have a virtual function override that only differs by return type.  And since it can't tell that shared_ptr<A> and shared_ptr<B> are related by value_type, it complains (this is the larger point that I granted you earlier).  But the type theatrics are hiding a bigger problem....<p>In this example, you can either fix the type error by making makeOne() return a boost::shared_ptr<A> in all factories (in which case, you <i>really do</i> want a polymorphic interface), or you can make a new function that returns a different pointer type (in which case, you don't).  The type system here is doing you a favor, and telling you that your design is bogus -- you shouldn't be creating a polymorphic factory interface that returns different types (because that isn't actually polymorphic, is it?)<p>This isn't totally academic:  I find that in nearly all type-error situations like this one, the real problem can be traced back to sloppy coding.<p><i>""locking the memory bus to do atomic operations on a shared_ptr totally blows when you're expected to turn a request around in a few microseconds.""</i><p>There's always a cost to reference counting, and therefore, it's not always appropriate.  That said, the only time you should be triggering atomic operations are on pointer copies and allocations.  If you're doing allocations per request, kiss your microsecond response time goodbye -- the reference count overhead is the least of your worries.

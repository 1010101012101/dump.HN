Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software” to show we do not mean it is gratis.",1430326794

9459647,comment,9459383,9459383,0,0,rmxt,,,"&quot;No thru traffic&quot; signs have been a part of life for a long time, long before Waze came around, and that&#x27;s the simplest answer to the issue for these residents. [1] Yes, as other posters have pointed out, this is an instance of technology butting up against entrenched interests and behaviors: the shortcuts formerly only known by a few, are now available to anybody with a smartphone; rich residents get mad at the increased traffic, and political action happens quicker when rich people are involved. [2,3]<p>Whether or not this is an example of the rich getting their way more quickly than the average person, I think that the point about residential areas seeing increased through traffic is an important one. No one, whether rich or poor, wants to live on a heavily trafficked street. (I believe that it is possible to create environments that contain both successful transportation infrastructure and livable streets for <i>all</i> people.) The answer, however, isn&#x27;t to shut these roads off to thru traffic (an exercise in futility), but rather to create better routes for people to get to work. Whether these routes are better mass transit options, better new roads, or improvements to existing roads, they will all, unfortunately, be uphill battles against NIMBYers. Hopefully LA, and the US in general, can eventually come around from the car-dominated perception of the urban environment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=236446"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=236446</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Council_District_2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Council_Distr...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley#Property_values"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley#Property_v...</a>",1430326259

There are dreamers, and there are doers... and clearly, you are a DOER. BRING IT... I&#x27;m getting motivated just thinking about how hard you&#x27;ve already worked in the lab to GET TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW!<p>I&#x27;ll try to hit most of your key points:<p>1. <i>&quot;[...] at the age of 33.&quot;</i><p>I would encourage you to forget about age. It&#x27;s just a number. In reality, the clock is ticking for all of us, so I think it&#x27;s more important to focus on <i>right now.</i> Work to live in the moment. Some started early, some started late. I&#x27;m older than you, and I just published my first game for iOS in January, in Swift, which was an entirely new language when I started with Xcode 6 Beta 1. So, again, it&#x27;s just a number. You are bringing the thunder RIGHT NOW, and that&#x27;s what matters. I can&#x27;t stress this enough. Sure, wouldn&#x27;t it be grand if you had started on a Commodore 64 when you were 12? Well, that&#x27;s not the case, so you do what it takes, you do the work [1], you build that wall of knowledge brick by brick, and you make it happen for yourself.<p>2. <i>&quot;I now spend my days feeling overwhelmed and struggling [...]&quot;</i><p>To be honest, you&#x27;re not alone. When you are learning something new, this is the nature of the learning curve. You just have to keep building that wall, one brick at a time. Do the work. It&#x27;s the only way to move forward, the only way to hone your craft. You have to keep driving through.<p>3. <i>&quot;I annoy everyone else (who are all about 10 years younger than me) with my constant questions.&quot;</i><p>There is nothing wrong with asking questions. However, you have to know how to ask the right questions and work within the schedules of your colleagues. That is to say, the right questions are, for example, questions about the project, the architecture of the system, etc. For these, work to carve out time with the colleague(s) that can answer these questions, so that you aren&#x27;t hitting them up in a way that breaks everyone&#x27;s flow. The &quot;wrong&quot; questions, if you will, could be, &quot;How do I do X in language Y?&quot; Those types of questions are best answered by you doing your due-diligence and off-hours study.<p>4. <i>&quot;I find myself filled with regret that I didn&#x27;t start this career earlier [...]&quot;</i><p>See point 1 above. We&#x27;ve all played this game. We all have regrets. I wish I would have had kids earlier than I did, for example. But, guess what? I can&#x27;t change the past... I can only drive forward and GAIN GROUND. So, you&#x27;ll never win the &quot;Regret Game.&quot; You can&#x27;t win against yourself. Dr. Seuss said it best in, &quot;Oh, The Places You&#x27;ll Go!&quot; (Please read it if you haven&#x27;t; it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.) Here&#x27;s the quote: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid that sometimes you&#x27;ll play lonely games too. Games you can&#x27;t win &#x27;cause you&#x27;ll play against you.&quot; You are striving to evolve and striving to do the best that you can, and any decision that you make will ipso facto be made with the most up to date and diligent decision-making faculties that you can muster at the time. Therefore, you were right for what you believed to be right, in the moment that you made the decision, and that is all that will ever matter; strive to let go of the anchor of regret.<p>5. <i>&quot;I&#x27;d seriously consider quitting if I had anywhere else to go.&quot;</i><p>I would encourage you to keep grinding, keep learning. You have to embrace the grind. I know it&#x27;s rough. I&#x27;ve been there; I think we&#x27;ve all been there at some point, to be perfectly honest. But, in some sense, if you do leave, you may find yourself at exactly the same place, in the sense that... yes, you may be in a new job, with new people, new surroundings and perhaps new geography, but you will still be the same technically, that is, struggling to get your grounding and learning the craft. So, it may <i>feel</i> like changing will help, but I would encourage you to carefully evaluate that decision before taking any action.<p>I wish you all the best.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7076143"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7076143</a>",1430325913

For instance, there&#x27;s little value in having CanCompareForEquality, CanCompareForInequality, HasLessThan, HasGreaterThan, HasLessThanOrEqual, and HasGreaterThanOrEqual be separate concepts; they should be grouped into, say, HasTotalOrdering, EqualityComparable, and HasPartialOrdering.  The current STL gets this wrong, it wants a concept of HasPartialOrdering but it actually requires HasLessThan (and fakes equality comparison by assuming if a is not less than b and b is not less than a, then a and b must be equal).

Heuristic decisions are in the XA standard since its first version (1991). YMMV, but they are very often used (to say the least) in 2PC production systems. See for example how Mark Little describes them: <a href=""http://planet.jboss.org/post/2pc_or_3pc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://planet.jboss.org/post/2pc_or_3pc</a>. Not really presented as an optional thing.
It shows traditional databases are not that &#x27;CP at all cost&#x27; when it comes to managing failure.<p>> Your conclusion is correct [...] the resulting algorithm is not C or A
Yeah... I see 2PC as not partition-tolerant as a partition breaks acid-atomicity. Once partition intolerance is accepted, CA fits well: 2PC is consistent & available until there is a partition. Saying &#x27;2PC is not consistent and not available but is partition tolerant&#x27; is not false technically but it&#x27;s a much less accurate description.<p>> Third [...] datacenters full of commodity servers [...]
> redundant NICs and cables, located next to each other 
> [...] It isn&#x27;t hard to believe that you could build a system, like that,
> in which you could add algorithms that were CA<p>I just totally agree with you here. CAP as a categorization tool is used for all types of distributed systems, but there is a huge difference between an application built on commodity hardware running in a multi-dc config and a 2 nodes system running on redundant hardware in a single rack.
Typically, 2PC is historically used on very specific applications: few nodes, a limited number of operations between the nodes, expensive redundant hardware all over the place, limited scaling out needs (if any). Not your typical big data system.",1430323769

9459230,comment,9451652,9451908,0,0,soylentcola,,,"Jumping on your comment since it seems most relevant, but the topic of propaganda is one that has mostly gone unmentioned.<p>Over the past few days, there has been a massive uptick in the use of social media to spread propaganda and incite further unrest.  The most striking examples I&#x27;ve seen are the (seemingly) organized campaign on Twitter called #baltimorelootcrew.  This tag is allegedly being used by looters to post images of people they assaulted and of items they stole.  If you look at the accounts of the posters, their tweet histories often go back a few days with some really nasty racist stereotypes that would have probably fallen under Poe&#x27;s Law if not for the fact that earlier Twitter history is loaded with nothing but &quot;gamergate&quot; and other social-justice-trolling stuff.  So far it would seem that quite a few of these troll accounts are trying to fan the fire of racial tension.<p>Then there is the /r/baltimore subreddit.  Non-residents from racist and troll subs have piled in and begun posting false &quot;eyewitness&quot; accounts under fake names as well as downvote brigading anyone who is trying to set the record straight (from right there on the ground).  While the world is watching the baltimore subreddit, the most upvoted info is often completely fabricated to piss people off.<p>And then yesterday, there was the reddit live blog which was viewed by at least 10k people at any given time.  A few folks who claimed to be transcribing the police scanner logs were in actuality posting false reports of incidents all over the city (which were not actually happening).  At one point I messaged the account that was running it and somehow got replies from multiple accounts.  When I mentioned that a lot of the info being posted was erroneous, the main poster replied &quot;it&#x27;s only fake until it&#x27;s real&quot;.<p>This was also where they kept spamming the alleged flyers advertising more planned riots later in the day.  As far as I can tell, these flyers did not originate in the community but from online trolls.<p>People all over town and around the nation are following Twitter, Reddit, and other social sites but so much of the information is either malicious or part of the dangerous rumor mill that makes claims without verification and only serves to agitate people in a tense situation.",1430323322

The other kids all search the projects for him, but evening is coming on and it's getting harder to see.<p>At one point, Weird Harold is walking from streetlamp to streetlamp, peering into the pool of light under each pool. Rudy walks up and asks Harold what he's doing.

But all the time kids watch porno and go out and get the neighbor's kid pregnant (or get pregnant themselves). So parents have a highly irrational fear of doing anything to increase the already high sex drive that kids have. Especially in ages without birth control, controlling procreation until there was a good chance at child survival was a critical part of maintaining the species. Even with birth control, STDs travel through younger populations at a much, much higher rate than older ones, usually due to passions overcoming practicality.<p>Boobs beat bombs.",1267189913

1153048,comment,1153006,1153006,0,0,tankman,,,"1. Good idea.<p>2. Will recruiters be involved?<p>- Recruiters are always going to try to be involved in events like this. I guarantee that recruiters will try to attend by either posing as candidates in order to meet real candidates or by actually paying the $300 fee to attend as a hiring company. Maybe that's a good thing for hirelite's bottom line but is it a good thing for the event overall? This event seems like a good opportunity to cut recruiters out of the process but there doesn't seem to be any plan here to deal with this unavoidable contingency.<p>3. It says candidates who want to attend have to pass a programming test to qualify for free admittance.<p>- Wouldn't the programming test need to be tailored to the job each candidate is applying for - in which case it wouldn't make sense to give a test until during or after the event?<p>4. Is St Patrick's Day in NYC good or bad timing for a job interview?<p>5. In real speed dating, the 1-minute date is often strictly enforced. It says the interview will last 5 minutes. Is that a strict 5 minutes?",1267189644

1153045,comment,1152918,1152918,0,0,patio11,,,"Java was my first ""real"" programming language.  I went to a Java school.  I did primarily Java programming at my first job.  I've done almost exclusively Java programming at my current job.  I made a business selling downloadable Java software half just to show people it could be done.<p>I say this so that when I tell you DO NOT USE JAVA you won't think me biased.  Its strengths are more apparent in Big Freaking Enterprise applications with teams of dozens or hundreds of people working on them.  Its deficiencies are even more glaring when there are only two of you -- chiefly, the productivity lag you'll suffer to do even the smallest things.<p>You'll have a bit of a ramp-up period learning Rails, Django, or your favorite modern MVC framework of choice.  Trust me: it is worth it.  It will probably even make your cofounder a better Java programmer in the bargain.",1267189537

985851,comment,985789,985789,0,0,tsestrich,,,"For those curious, the response from my department head (who I worked with to set up the independent study):<p>""
This is a complicated question.<p>Effectively, the University owns everything (all IP) that we do while we are here, faculty, staff, and students alike.  However, they have very limited capability to
effectively copyright, patent, and market everything that is created.  If you were to go through the process of doing this through the University, they would return a portion of any income that they acquire.  In return, they cover the legal, patent, and marketing costs to get the product to market, or to find some company that would want to market it.  Given the number of things that are created in a university, the process of selecting which items to pursue is long and involved.<p>My suggestion is that you proceed on your own.  If you are hugely successful, then you would deal with the university at that time.
""<p>So it seems like most people here are right on. If I can't easily get any more information, I'll probably just go for it. I was just trying to see where I stand so I don't get myself in a ridiculous situation later where I say ""Why didn't I think of this earlier?"".",1260370709

985839,comment,985527,985527,0,0,MarkPNeyer,,,"Maybe i'm out of my league by criticizing this incredibly intelligent man's arguments, but here goes.<p>First, Dijkstra argues, ""There is no such thing as 'making money': some people succeed in transferring money out of the pockets of others into their own.""  The implication of his argument is that economic activity is zero sum - you can't create value, you can only take it from someone else. This is patently false - there is far more wealth in the world now than there was 100 years ago. If it is impossible to 'make money,' then where did this extra wealth come from? When I buy a computer from Dell, it's a win-win situation. Dell gets money from me, and i get a powerful tool which I could use to develop software, which I could then sell to others for more than the cost of the computer. The software that I write is wealth that I have created - the world is better off with the software in it than without the software.<p>Dijkstra then expresses his animus against banks, saying they become rich by trying to speculate at someone else's expense. This may be true of investment banks, but what about a bank that makes loans to new businesses? Exactly whose expense are the banks profiting from? The business gets ahead because it needs capital to get off the ground, and the banks get ahead because they earn interest on money that would otherwise be sitting idle.<p>I agree with his main argument, that 'software engineering' is a rather meaningless term, but I disagree with his hateful attitude towards the industrial world.",1260370198

IIRC, this was fairly lenient in my favour, although this was for an undergraduate degree. I gather that the situation was different for PhD programmes. You have probably signed something like that too when you signed up, in among the endless paperwork. Dig it up and read it. Chances are you're safe as long as you don't use their equipment and facilities.<p>If there's any remaining doubt I'd probably try to solve the problem in advance by drafting a plain-English document which declares that the university has no rights to the works and get the advisor, the departmental head, and a relevant person who oversees research across the entire university to sign it. In fact, you probably have a dedicated person who oversees such matters at the university, so it may be best to take the draft to them directly and see if they have an equivalent standardised contract that they'll be more willing to sign than your draft.",1260370034

I read an article recently which had a great analogy, comparing Chinas lending to the US (so that the US can continue to buy Chinese exports) to Lucent Technologies in the nineties, lending money to dot com startups so they could keep buying Lucent hardware - economic growth continues steadily, but eventually when these loans are to be cashed in, the economy will crumble. Of course, China has an exit that Lucent did not, as mentioned here (and the article mentioned it too) - China has the option of war!<p>It seems to me that the Chinese economy is a giant bubble; one which I'd rather not see burst, but bubbles tend to do that...

Not true at all.  If the superposition in the QM formalism merely represents our ignorance about the system's state, rather than an objective reality, then QC loses the massive parallelism which is supposed to make it so much more efficient than classical computation.",1260367493

At that scale you can use anything and it simply doesn't matter either way.<p>Since you seem to have mild reading comprehension issues I will spell that out for you: Neither will a profitable business break a sweat over paying 500 more or less on hosting. Nor do many of the benefits of EC2 come into play at such a small scale.<p><i>So either throw out some stats and numbers or stop bullshitting people. There are enough people blindly drinking the cloud hosting koolaid without the fake facts.</i><p>I don't like your tone.

If you are immune to basic math then that's your problem, no need to get personal.<p><i>Its cheaper to have your own engineer and manage xx servers on colo then it is to have amazon.</i><p>I conclude that you simply have no idea what you're talking about, much less about the figures involved.

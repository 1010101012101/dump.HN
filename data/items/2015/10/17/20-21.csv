Supposedly it&#x27;s become better in recent years.<p>Here&#x27;s an (out of date) overview of the hotkeys:[1] Some of the hotkeys change in each new release.  In typical open source fashion, the &quot;solution&quot; to that mess was to make the several hundred hotkeys remappable: &quot;Important note: the ever changing nature of Blender&#x27;s development means features can be arbitrarily updated so shortcut keys may be mapped to different functions or be in different locations version to version - this is especially true of Blender 2.50 up to and included the latest versions.&quot;<p>If you like EMACS, you might like Blender.<p>From a developer perspective, the Blender game engine is interesting.

I wasn&#x27;t making a statement about the order of parameters themselves, but how all parameters are typed.<p>> In the case of elem, both orders are reasonable, but often times only one makes sense and then it is easy to remember.<p>In some languages where callbacks taking positional arguments are idiomatic (like Javascript), untyped functions can cause a lot of problems by making it really hard to discern/remember what gets passed in where. In Haskell, there&#x27;s often very little onus on the developer to <i>remember</i> anything at all; the type system will make sure they got the order right.<p>Obvious exceptions are non-associative functions of the type<p><pre><code>  a -> a -> a\n</code></pre>\nThen, one might have to check to see what goes in first and what goes in second.",1445115486

And there were real-world mechanisms for dealing with these.<p>For a new businessman or professional setting out in the world, pre-Internet, &quot;establishing your name&quot; was a requirement. These days the concept&#x27;s often referred to as &quot;creating a personal brand&quot;, but the reality was pretty straightforward: how does an unknown quantity become a known quantity?<p>A common method was the professional or social introduction. This is still practiced, where a third-party _matchmaker_ will introduce two parties. The matchmaker usually knows both, and can vouch for the newcomer and smooth the path for introductions with the established party. Essentially, the matchmaker stakes _their_ reputation by speaking for another.<p>Lawrence Lessig describes a similar concept in his book <i>Code and Other Laws of Cypberspace</i>, in a passage describing a physical messaging system, the Yale Wall. This was a board onto which messages could be posted, with the proviso that that they be signed. Unsigned messages would be posted from time to time, effectively presenting an anonymous viewpoint. Removal wasn&#x27;t instantaneous or automatic, but rather, at some point <i>prior</i> to garbage collection, another individual could review the piece, and, if they felt it warranted posting, sign for it. They weren&#x27;t registering themselves as <i>author</i>, but as <i>vouching for the merits of the viewpoint</i> -- not necessarily agreement.<p>A messaging system in which a new peer might be able to indicate that, hey, peers X, Y, and Z, with established reputations can vouch for me, and for which those peers could confirm their endorsement, might address the &quot;how to build reputation&quot; issues of new mailservers.<p>I&#x27;ve also found that even large mail systems will frequently have <i>some</i> procedure for getting at least provisionally vetted, effectively a workfactor cost to coming online.

10405882,comment,10403820,10405470,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"The problem is &quot;the law&quot; is murky on web scraping. For example, did you know that even if your users are only extracting non-copyrighted (even non-copyrightable) data from a page, a judge once ruled that the act of storing the entire page in RAM constituted copyright infringement, since it contained some copyrighted elements that were immediately disposed of after extraction (like the company&#x27;s logo)? This was <i>Ticketmaster v. RMG Technologies</i>, and it was used against Power Ventures in Facebook&#x27;s case against them.<p>Contrast with <i>Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.</i>, where it was ruled that it was legal to copy data from a phonebook and republish, since it was non-copyrightable factual data.<p>There are several other ridiculous early rulings that were made while the internet was still coming of age, and I think before many judges really understood the way it worked. Recent cases have been bucking these precedents, but you can still get the book thrown at you based on those rulings.<p>Read about 3Taps and please understand that you <i>will</i> be sued, as they were, unless you fold the moment you get a C&D, which would make your site fairly useless.<p>Google and all other search engines <i>are</i> illegal in the US in most cases. They just don&#x27;t get in trouble for most of their activity because people usually <i>want</i> to be on Google. If you end up collecting data in a way that someone doesn&#x27;t like, things won&#x27;t go so well for you. See <i>Facebook Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.</i>. That guy got raked over the coals; I&#x27;m sure Facebook was trying to make an example of him.<p>Data portability is a threat to the business model of many web incumbents, and that means they want scraping, a critical tool for ensuring that portability, to remain in a nebulous grey area; this allows them to use it for their own purposes (which they often do) and also to try to block people who are using data found on their platform in a way they don&#x27;t like. This basically results in the bigger company getting their way, because only other multi-billion dollar companies really have the resources to fight against the army of $1k/hr lawyers that public companies hire to try to enforce their opinions on upstarts.<p>What we <i>really</i> need is serious internet law reform that favors a fair and open platform. Unfortunately, whenever we hear about &quot;internet law reform&quot;, it&#x27;s skewed to the interests of the megacorps who want more tools to shut down innovators that may threaten their business models, not toward creating an open and fair environment for innovation.<p>Consider, for instance, how ridiculous it would be if every time you opened a book one of the title pages contained a &quot;Terms of Reading&quot; that bound you not to use the information in the book, even the non-copyrightable information, in any way that the book&#x27;s publisher didn&#x27;t like, required you to only read the book using the publisher&#x27;s approved reading methods (perhaps only Oakleys and Ray-bans are publisher-approved eyeglasses, only Herman-Miller publisher-approved seating, and only GE bulbs publisher-approved lighting), required you to agree that you&#x27;d never sue the publisher in court but always use private arbitrators that the publisher can easily, even implicitly, buy off, and so forth.<p>Consider the viability of the argument that you committed copyright infringement by looking at the pages of the book when the author didn&#x27;t want you to, because the reflection of the content on your eyes constituted an illegal copy.<p>These things would get laughed out of court, but the digital equivalent is frequently upheld when it comes to online activity.<p>I think eventually things will stabilize and scraping non-copyrighted data will unambiguously not be a crime, but unfortunately, I think it may still be a few more decades until that happens. I really hope your company is able and willing to help us set the right precedents by committing the tens of millions it will take to win each piece of that stability, since you&#x27;re set up so perfectly to be the target of several scraping-related lawsuits.<p>Recent rulings, like <i>QVC v. Resultly</i> and <i>Nguyen v. Barnes and Noble Inc.</i> have been much more positive than former ones, even if they&#x27;re not altogether ideal, indicating that some magistrates are starting to think of the internet in sensible terms. The rest has to be done through the legislature. Please help make the web safe for data.<p>IANAL",1445113065

10405866,comment,10401344,10403222,0,0,kragen,,,"Potassium iodide is not iodine; it is a compound of iodine, with the same relation to iodine that table salt (sodium chloride) has to chlorine gas, which is a chemical weapon.  In fact, both potassium iodide and sodium chloride are alkali halides, compounds of the halogens iodine and chlorine, respectively.  Iodine is extremely reactive and consequently toxic, not only to people, but even more so to bacteria, which is why it is useful in disinfecting water.  Tincture of iodine typically contains both potassium iodide and elemental iodine, but it&#x27;s the elemental iodine that does the work.<p>Iodine, on contact with electron donors, will rapidly reduce them and ionize to the same nontoxic iodide found in potassium iodide, rendering it nearly harmless.  However, oxidizing your body cells causes chemical burns by killing them; oxidizing bacteria and fungi kills their cells too.  Pure iodine will blister your skin on contact.<p>Essentially your optimism arises from confusing two related, but very different, substances.  Don&#x27;t feel bad; I&#x27;ve made similar errors any number of times.  One out of every ten thousand times that you think you&#x27;ve found an easy way to hack around a difficult and important problem, it&#x27;s a breakthrough.  The other 9,999 times, you&#x27;re overlooking a fundamental reason your idea won&#x27;t work.<p>It&#x27;s deeply unfortunate that HN is not the kind of place that people will correct your mistakes, as I&#x27;ve done above, instead of silently downvoting you.<p>If you are using CNS stimulants (amphetamines, methylphenidate, modafinil, cocaine, maybe even caffeine) you might want to cut down your dosage.  The hyperfocus they facilitate can be counterproductive when it causes you to overlook your errors and get overexcited over a possible breakthrough.  This can blossom into full-blown amphetamine psychosis, which is not an experience I recommend, especially for the people around you.<p>A useful tool in discovering errors like this is investigating consequences that would ensue should your reasoning turn out to be true.  For example:<p>* Potassium iodide is a chemical that people have been dosed with many times, including soldiers under controlled conditions.  If it cured everything from jock itch to acute bacterial meningitis, probably someone would have noticed.<p>* Bottles of iodine are labeled &quot;for external use only&quot;.  If it were nontoxic, it would not be labeled in this way.<p>* Many potassium iodide vendors and customers are enthusiastic promoters of colloidal silver, which actually is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is fairly nontoxic to human bodies.  (By itself, it&#x27;s not effective enough to disinfect water with, but in combination with the more toxic copper, ionized silver has been used to disinfect water.)  If KI were effective for disinfection, they would be promoting it as such.<p>* Our bodies use iodide in certain thyroid hormones, so there are enzymes devoted to moving iodide ions around, keeping them from reacting with the wrong things, etc.  This is different from e.g. lead, mercury, or tellurium, which have no known biological function and cause toxicity by acting as poor substitutes for other atoms.  If iodide were nontoxic and effective at stopping fungal infections, we would have evolved to concentrate it in our bodies and direct it to areas suffering from inflammation.  But we didn&#x27;t.",1445112809

Our backend is essentially a cloud mail user agent (MUA), but can have similar issues to a MTA or mailbox provider.<p>It turns out that creating a successful product in the email space requires you to build relationships and partnerships with the existing vendors/providers. It takes a lot of work, and is part of what you pay for when using Mailgun/Mandrill/etc.<p>These &quot;greylists&quot; and systems that drop mail from unknown IPs have been pretty carefully designed and tuned to combat the insane amount of spam out there. They work remarkably well, and for most of today&#x27;s email users, spam is no longer an issue. (The current state of email abuse innovation is promotions/marketing/etc. which is a more subtle challenge.)<p>At the end of this article, the author writes, &quot;This isn&#x27;t how the internet is supposed to work.&quot; Ironically this system of obscure reputation-based email is a <i>direct result of how the email system was actually designed to work</i>, with a total lack of permissions or feedback loop. Many SMTP servers used to not even require a password.<p>Stuff like DKIM/SPF and DMARC is a step in the right direction. But the RFCs upon which our email system is based were written decades ago, and in many cases have fundamental flaws, like SMTP leaking metadata no matter what. I could go on and on about issues with email, and why I care about getting them fixed, but let&#x27;s just say it was designed in a different era of Internet with different constraints and opportunities.<p>So how do you build a new email service and not get blocked? Well, you spend a few weeks or months emailing, calling, Skyping, and meeting with folks in the current space. You work your way up through marketing support and random protocol discussion lists until you are talking with the folks who can influence which IPs are blocked/unblocked. Then you convince them you are (1) building a legit venture, (2) are worthy of their trust, and (3) don&#x27;t directly compete with them. Then you&#x27;ll get a small number of clean IPs and you <i>must not screw up!</i><p>There are a few hacks, like sometimes a single partner/vendor will sell you a block of clean IPs and help manage the spam reputation. But usually it&#x27;s just a lot of sweat and annoying phone calls. It takes way, way longer than setting up SPF/DKIM. The challenge is more relationships than technical.<p>Once you have a new email sending provider, the burden shifts to <i>you</i> for doing abuse/spam prevention. And you find yourself implementing many of the strategies and systems you cursed when getting started. But that&#x27;s the circle of rfc2822 life I guess.<p>Oh, and never use EC2 IPs for sending mail. Most of them have been burned by spammers.",1445112767

They are both discussing the meaning of the word &quot;type&quot;.<p><a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2661154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2661154</a><p>There was a good blog post by Stephen Kell that I can&#x27;t find now (<a href=""https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~srk31/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~srk31/blog/</a>)<p>&quot;The concept of &quot;type&quot; has been used without a consistent, precise definition in discussions about programming languages for 60 years. In this essay I explore various concepts lurking behind distinct uses of this word, highlighting two traditions in which the word came into use largely independently: engineering traditions on the one hand, and those of symbolic logic on the other. These traditions are founded on differing attitudes to the nature and purpose of abstraction, but their distinct uses of &quot;type&quot; have never been explicitly unified. One result is that discourse across these traditions often finds itself at cross purposes, such as overapplying one sense of &quot;type&quot; where another is appropriate, and occasionally proceeding to draw wrong conclusions. I illustrate this with examples from well-known and justly well-regarded literature, and argue that ongoing developments in both the theory and practice of programming make now a good time to resolve these problems.&quot;",1445112288

I know we all like to say ""why should these guys decide?"", but if we want to be able to use libraries from different assemblers we need some standards/drafts.<p>And it's not really a ""committee"". Anyone can join the discussion. If the ""committee"" fails to understand your point, you are free to follow your own standards. If lots of people are unsatisfied, someone will fork it.<p>Just remember to communicate <i>before</i> you write lots of code/libraries/tools that only work with your own standard.",1333882716

3813574,comment,3813302,3813320,10,0,Natsu,,,"It's a toy CPU that's perfect for learning.  It's about to be part of Notch's new game (he created Minecraft).  So it's a great combination of fun + educational.  Honestly, I'm surprised no one has made one of these CPUs in Minecraft yet.  I can guarantee that it's possible.<p>In other words, this has a lot of people excited about a game that doesn't even exist yet.  Oh, and given the popularity of Notch's games and the buzz for this one, I'm sure that a few people will manage to turn a tidy profit based on their fun.  There are more than a few highly popular Minecraft websites, YouTube channels, etc.  So there are a lot of things that appeal to hackers.  It's a great toy system to play with, it's going to be an important part of an interesting game, etc.<p>Note that some people have already learned about electronics by building redstone circuits in Minecraft.  It abstracts away everything but the logic, so it's a fun way to play with logic gates and whatnot to build something interesting.  For example, I have a giant circuit hooked to a redstone clock to periodically flood the spawning pads of the gigantic mob grinder that covers my base camp and increase the number of items I get.  It's enormous, but not particularly exceptional by Minecraft standards.  It does help me produce a lot of TNT, though.  I put a record player in the item collection room to pass the time.",1333882542

This is why I now teach Javascript differently, I have written down a minimalist JS approach.

6792945,comment,6790392,6792084,3,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The problem is that whether or not we have shared mutable state on a logical level is not for us to choose. It&#x27;s ultimately a property of the task at hand. Pushing shared state onto the database doesn&#x27;t make it go away. Workarounds like MapReduce or monads only help us defer the moment of truth. If shared mutable state is what users ultimately expect to see, these approaches are merely simulations of shared mutable state that exploit a time gap in users&#x27; perception.<p>That gap is very brittle. Nightly batch windows become too short. Users expect real time updates leading to major redesigns of entire systems, like Google dropping MapReduce for their search index.<p>But I think your point about state being the major difference between OO and FP is absolutely true. In OO systems, statefulness is the default everywhere. Nothing is formally known about state in OO system and that is a bad thing. We need state to be explicit and formally specified.",1385365158

Peeing ones pants would have been preferable, it&#x27;s astounding how far we&#x27;ve come.<p>As for Windows vs. OS/2 it&#x27;s at best complicated. It&#x27;s a bit like a micro-cosm of the PC vs mainframe debate. The raison d&#x27;etre of Windows 95 was backward compatability with a low memory footprint.<p>That may seem like a small thing, or at best not a thing to make so many enormous compromises over, but back then it was everything. The problem with doing multi-tasking &quot;right&quot; was that it imposed a ~4mb RAM requirement per 16-bit application being run at the same time. That is nothing today but back then 4mb was the minimum requirement for installing Windows 95, and it represented a cost of around $100 in 1995. Owning a computer powerful enough to run even a handful of 16-bit apps while running OS/2 or NT was simply above the economic means of a lot of people. And by the time technology caught up and RAM became cheap enough to make proper multi-tasking cost effective there was too much Windows 9x network effect for competitors to make much headway.",1385363873

6792906,comment,6790392,6790392,2,0,naiquevin,,,"I can somewhat relate to the conversations in the article. While I admit that I don&#x27;t think I used OOP correctly, since I started using more functions instead of classes (in Python, my primary language), I observed that it has been more convenient to reuse and refactor existing code.<p>Another observation is that it&#x27;s far easier to read someone else&#x27;s code if there is no mutation. For eg. I have enrolled for the proglang course[1] on coursera and only yesterday I completed this weeks homework which involves enhancing an already written game of Tetris in Ruby. Major part of the assignment was about reading and understanding the provided code that uses OOP and makes heavy use of mutation. It was quite difficult to understand what one method does without having a picture of the current state of the object, specially with side effecting methods that call other side effecting methods. A few times I had to add print statements here and there to actually understand which one is being when and how many times. While I could score full marks in the end, I am still not confident about completely understanding the code and have a feeling that if I ever need to work with it again, the amount of time it will take to load up everything again into my mind&#x27;s memory will be equal to what it took for the first time.<p>Of course, one could only make a true comparison by studying an implementation of Tetris written in FP style. But from my experience with reading and writing code in Erlang (for production) and Racket, Clojure (as hobby) I find it relatively easier to study functional code written by others.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang</a>",1385363810

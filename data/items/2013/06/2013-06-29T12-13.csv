Some things are too big to end at the sensibilities of any person on this planet. Since I know for a fact that the people at the top are deluded and could really use some saving from themselves -- without knowing any of them, simply because power and wealth as ends in and of themselves are black holes, and only the mediocre pursue them -- there is simply nothing left to tip toe around, just a lot to discuss.<p>And the initial condescension reminded me of this quote, the bit about privilege:<p><i>I&#x27;ve heard quite a lot of people that talk about post-privacy, and they talk about it in terms of feeling like, you know, it&#x27;s too late, we&#x27;re done for, there&#x27;s just no possibility for privacy left anymore and we just have to get used to it. And this is a pretty fascinating thing, because it seems to me that you never hear a feminist say that we&#x27;re post-consent because there is rape. And why is that? The reason is that it&#x27;s bullshit.<p>We can&#x27;t have a post-privacy world until we&#x27;re post-privilege. So when we cave in our autonomy, then we can sort of say, &quot;well, okay, we don&#x27;t need privacy anymore, in fact we don&#x27;t have privacy anymore, and I&#x27;m okay with that.&quot; Realistically though people are not comfortable with that. Because, if you only look at it from a position of privilege, like, say, white man on a stage, then yeah, maybe post-privacy works out okay for those people. But if you have ever not been, or if you are currently not, a white man with a passport from one of the five good nations in the world, it might not really work out well for you, and in fact it might be designed specifically such that it will continue to not work out well for you, because the structures themselves produce these inequalities.<p>So when you hear someone talk about post-privacy, I think it&#x27;s really important to engage them about their own privilege in the system and what it is they are actually arguing for.</i><p>-- Jacob Appelbaum ( <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3h46EbqhPo&t=7m46s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3h46EbqhPo&t=7m46s</a> )<p>Maybe outrage isn&#x27;t helpful, as a constant emotional state that is, but let&#x27;s say &quot;if you&#x27;re not discussing this seriously, you&#x27;re not paying attention&quot;, neither to today nor to history.",1372510623

If you host something which is illegal say in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (not that hard to do), and make it available over neocities also to Saudi Arabia, then is it illegal or not? Well, in practice for sure KSA will just block whole domain, and probably you don&#x27;t care. I think whole youtube is still blocked in Turkey because of single bad video. Where are physically your servers?<p>Also I&#x27;m afraid according to many countries you would be legally responsible to the content what you help to publish. So any single page with questionable content may end up badly for you.<p>Geocities worked because these nasty legal problems did not come up yet, Internet was a marginal non-serious thing, and even if bad content was published then no-one noticed or reacted to it. Now a web is the mainstream media, and you may find out that technical hosting of some bytes is really smallest problem in the global publishing business. In order to follow all laws of all the countries where you operate (i.e. from where your site is accessible) you need to monitor the content, react to notifications etc.",1372509049

I could see Nvidia going beyond mobile with it though. Consider this playbook for Nvidia:<p>1)Build an ARM 64bit chip with the latest GPU tech (not the generations behind stuff they've been using on mobile), and unified addressing with the memory controller on die.<p>2)Stick a bunch of fast ram, some fast flash for storage and a gigabit chip to build a blade server.<p>3)Start selling these to people that today have GPGPU type loads. This should easily be cheaper and more power efficient than the equivalent Intel solution.<p>4)As 64bit ARM becomes more performance competitive with x86 (is that happening?) and people get used to developing for ARM, move to take over more traditional CPU workloads.<p>It would make sense for them as they've already tried to enter the x86 market with their motherboard/chipset business before and been mildly successful. Back then they were just trying to build a better x86 and got squeezed by Intel, here they'd be using the classic Innovator Dilemma strategy of coming from a lesser product (ARM) to dominate the market.<p>One of the most interesting points in Ars previous articles about AMD was that before they decided to buy ATI they were actually considering Nvidia but the sticking point was that Nvidia's CEO wanted to be CEO of the joint company. It makes you wonder what could have come out of AMD+Nvidia with Jen-Hsun Huang at the helm.",1367321524

Running a support service is extremely expensive. For most services, there's usually an option where if you open your wallet wider, you get better service (often at another company), but the general public don't like that option.<p><i>This type of incompetence seems to be fairly widespread these days</i><p>Not just these days. I worked for the telco 9 years ago, and we had a main product and a rebadged rural-friendly product. We could access the main product webpage to help talk people through how to log in (very useful), but the side product was banned for us. I emailed management: please unlock our own product page, it will help us help the customer and shorten our queue times. Management's response? ""That's an IT decision"". So I emailed IT the same thing. IT's response? ""That's a management decision"". Come on guys, I'm taking calls 100% of the time and I have the political power of a newt.<p>At this same job I would work 15 minutes unpaid overtime just to finish off the paperwork for the day and leave good notes that I didn't have time for. The other calltakers thought I was deranged for working when not paid. After the above story, it's not hard to see why. Management really didn't care, and that filtered down. It's not like my colleagues were motivated achievers in the first place, but there was also no high bar set at any point, no leading by example. Next time you're angry that no notes were left in your account, realise that more likely it's a management issue. Curiously as a counterpoint, in my next job it was expected that 30% of a field technician's time was put aside for paperwork. Didn't quite work out that way, but that was the nominal benchmark (as opposed to 0% at the call centre).<p>Clusterfucks in billing were the usual error on our side.

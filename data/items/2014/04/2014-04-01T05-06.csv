Too many people forget this fact.<p>I&#x27;m glad at least one person can see that most patents are not just a matter of being mere algorithms; they&#x27;re specific processes which have some kind of useful result. Arithmetic coding by itself is a mere algorithm, but its use to compress data in an optimal way is patentable because it provides a useful useful result.

7506363,comment,7498573,7504355,1,0,setrofim_,,,">In particular, defense ought to be expanded to &quot;the legitimate use of physical force or threat of force in proportionate response to the initial use of physical force or threat of force against your person or property.&quot;<p>Why? You&#x27;re arbitrarily narrowing down the definition of &quot;defense&quot; to suit your argument. Are you saying that anything short of physical violence or threat of physical violence is not a real threat that can be legitimately defended against (either through physical means or otherwise)? An if we&#x27;re going down this route, an attacker may well choose physical violence to get me to divulge my knowledge just as they might use it to deprive me of a physical possession.<p>>The only reason why you&#x27;re depriving me of some tangible benefit is because it&#x27;s scarce. If you take some resource from me that isn&#x27;t scarce, then no benefit is lost because I can immediately conjure up another resource of identical value. Therefore, there is no conflict.<p>True, but again, you&#x27;re thinking of scarcity in purely physical terms. Say I run a food stand, and due to my grandma&#x27;s secret sauce recipe, I have no shortage of customers. You, my competitor, acquire that recipe from me (you may have stolen a written copy, blackmailed me, or even simply beaten it out of me in a dark alley). You now start adding the same sauce to your product and take away some of my customers. Your knowledge of the recipe, has not diminished my knowledge of it, however it <i>has</i> diminished my competitive advantage (the scarce &quot;resource&quot; in this case) and so that knowledge no longer has the same value.<p>>Defining property in terms of tangible benefits is simply untenable because there is no bound to it. For example, I could claim that the person who lives next to me lowers the value of my house because they never cut their lawn. I could therefore claim that they are creating conflict because they are removing some tangible benefit that I have.<p>Yes, true, and certain councils and home owners associations do exactly that. It is a gradient. But that&#x27;s the point -- the place where you choose to draw the &quot;property&quot; line on this gradient is necessarily arbitrary. You&#x27;re claiming that your arbitrary point (physical exclusivity) is actually <i>the</i> right point, and any other point is &quot;untenable&quot;. My argument is that this is not the case, and today, in a world of increasing automation of physical labor and freer, near-instantaneous communication, where an increasing portion of the population (in the West, at least) are engaging in what could be classified as &quot;intellectual pursuits&quot;, physical boundaries are becoming increasingly inadequate.<p>>The paper does address them, you just didn&#x27;t read those parts.<p>You&#x27;re right, I&#x27;ve lost interest words the end of the paper, and didn&#x27;t read it all the way through. My apologies. I have now.<p>>Trademarks are discussed starting on page 43 and it&#x27;s quite clear that no validity is given to the concept of intellectual property rights.<p>Not in the case of trademarks. For trade secrets, the author, after wrangling with the legal notion of contract, does begrudgingly admit that trade secrets are a valid form of intellectual property (or at least, that they may form a valid grounds for legal recourse...).<p>The author&#x27;s argument against trademarks is absurd. After establishing the concept of a trademark in the first paragraph, they dismiss it out of hand and with no justification or argument to back it up at the beginning of the second. The author then proceeds to construct and knock down the strawman of consumer rights (which is not what trademarks are about). Finally, they use their (entirely unsupported) conclusion about the notion of trademark ownership to dismiss the idea of trademark dilution.<p>>This isn&#x27;t arbitrary at all because it&#x27;s consistently applying the illegitimacy of owning ideas.<p>Except the author never justifies it. Instead, they assume illegitimacy of owning ideas, and then proceed to use that assumption to demonstrate how the (a priori) illegitimate laws are, in fact, illegitimate.

They went for the lowest end of the market, where at a typical price point on 99d, clients don&#x27;t require a lot of hand-holding. Instead, the illusion of value is delivered to clients by the fact that many designers compete to create something for you. They have captured the cheap-and-fast market well.<p>From the point of creating value, however, I am really not a big fan of 99d. I do know some people who had some level of success there, but I know a lot more who spent money only to get back some very crappy results.<p>The mechanics of a cheap marketplace simply don&#x27;t allow for value. Designers have no incentive to spend time working for you, because the odds of them getting paid are really low. They are, in fact, incentivized to produce the bare minimum at the fastest speed possible.<p>At the end of the day, you may feel like 20 people worked for you and one was the winner, but in reality, you only got the minimum attention and effort.<p>I wrote a little more on this topic before, in case you&#x27;re interested: <a href=""https://medium.com/startup-shenanigans/66896bbf21da"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/startup-shenanigans/66896bbf21da</a>",1396330269

7506285,comment,7503829,7505892,12,0,abalone,,,"No way is that an obvious answer. The average consumer is massively more at risk of fraud & theft from their hosted bitcoin wallet than via their charge account.<p>All cards offer protection against theft and fraud including a means of disputing and getting refunds (chargebacks). Definitely not the case for bitcoin wallets.<p>Here&#x27;s why. Cards may have weaker authentication but they have an intermediary party involved in governing the transaction. Bitcoin has no intermediary party, which places a heavier burden on authentication, and no recourse in case anything goes wrong.<p>So, the only way for bitcoin to increase protection against fraud is to ratchet up the level of security around authentication. Two factor, cold storage, all that. All things that are significant <i>inconveniences</i> for consumers. You can point to them and say &quot;it&#x27;s safer than card numbers&quot; but that&#x27;s missing the other tier of protection. Overall it&#x27;s less safe, because if fraud does happen there&#x27;s no recourse, and the more you inconvenience the consumer the less likely they are to secure things properly not to mention use the thing in the first place.<p>For everyday commerce, the two-tier level of protection that cards offer is much more amenable: a &quot;decent&quot; level of security at the time of the transaction that&#x27;s still very convenient for the consumer, and the safety net of chargebacks.<p>By the way, you mentioned the lack of chargebacks as a security benefit.. but you&#x27;re confusing <i>merchant</i> benefits (they don&#x27;t like chargebacks) and consumer benefits (<i>definitely</i> benefit from the ability to dispute fraudulent charges and defective goods).",1396329320

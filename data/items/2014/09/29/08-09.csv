8382123,comment,8372329,8374045,2,0,pyxll,,,"PyXLL embeds python, and so runs python in-process (that is, in the same process as Excel, without spawning a child process).<p>PyXLL fully supports UDFs (user defined functions) in a fast, efficient way. Calling a pyxll function (UDF written in python) calls into the in-process python interpreter and so there is no cost of starting up a new python process or calling into an out of process COM server.<p>Excel and Python types are converted to and from each other in optimized C code, depending on the argument and return types specified for the function (UDF). The type conversion is user extensible and so can handle automatically converting Excel ranges to and from pandas DataFrames (just one example).<p>The full Excel API is accessible from pyxll using the well known and established win32com package.<p>PyXLL works with Python 2 and 3, 32 bit and 64 bit (all versions from python 2.3 and 3.4).<p>PyXLL supports newer features of recent Excel releases like multi-threading and asynchronous functions, while maintaining compatibility with older versions.<p>PyXLL can expose python functions as Excel macros and menus as well as UDFs.<p>If you want to script Excel from a process outside of excel (eg IPython notebook) you can use win32com very easily without the need for any other package. But, if you want to have a python interpreter running inside Excel to be able to write performant UDFs as an alternative to writing VBA or C addins as far as I&#x27;m aware PyXLL is still the only package capable of doing that[1].<p>PyXLL has commercial support and is partnered with a major python training and consultancy company, Enthought[2].<p>[1]DataNitro claims to be able to do with, but according to their docs you are limited to only being able to run one Excel instance at a time, which for most real world users is too limiting in my experience.<p>[2]<a href=""https://www.enthought.com/products/pyxll/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.enthought.com/products/pyxll/</a>",1411981138

8382120,comment,8381480,8382095,1,0,jorangreef,,,"I think in practice it will work well, given that bufferbloat is often the cause of congestion on a home network. TCP itself is usually quadratically impaired when it comes to reacting and backing off in the face of increasing latency caused by buffers (uploading a large file through Dropbox or Google Drive will most likely cause ping times on other machines on the same network to degrade from milliseconds to seconds).<p>When it comes to bufferbloat, a single TCP flow can dominate all others and be highly unfair because TCP&#x27;s congestion algorithms are so slow to react (they often only react to packet loss and not latency).<p>LEDBAT and delay-based congestion algorithms were designed to handle bufferbloat well, and PCC is essentially a superset of these, taking into account loss rate and throughput in addition to just delay.",1411981026

8382097,comment,8381493,8381746,44,0,teddyh,,,"> <i>If Facebook scans my chat logs,</i> […] <i>their TOS permits them to scan my chat logs.</i><p>Your language betrays your cognitive dissonance.  It it not <i>your</i> chat log.  It was <i>never</i> your chat log.  You typed characters into Facebook’s chat log, and the chat log is <i>Facebook’s</i>.  There is no “permitting” needed.  When you use Facebook (or Google, or whatever), you live in a glass house, an aquarium, with overseers who do not consider you a person with integrity, but more as a kind of pet to be inspected and analyzed at will.  Facebook distracts you with “privacy settings”, but those apply to other pets in the aquarium, not its overseers.  It might be discomforting to think of yourself as a pet in an aquarium, but you have chosen this yourself, by using Facebook.<p>The question if Facebook is permitted to scan your chat logs is therefore <i>meaningless</i>; there is no such concept. Facebook “scans” <i>all its chat logs, all the time</i>.  (That’s why they <i>have</i> their chat logs.)  The “privacy settings” have nothing to do with actual privacy from Facebook — like Monopoly money, it has no validity outside the tiny world of its own.  Like “deleting” things, it appears to you to delete things, but does not <i>actually</i> delete them as far as Facebook is concerned — it is all logged and saved, forever.  I could go on, but I’d better not.<p>(The same goes for Google and all the other cloud and social services.)",1411980201

In most cases you just have a browser with independent streams or a bittorrent client with quite a few somewhat short-lived connections to a wide range of locations and also just a plain single transfer from a remote server to upgrade your Debian system.<p>These are all not quite multi-TCP and there was no real mention of fairness of PCC against a single TCP stream, even of the CUBIC form, not to mention just plain old NewReno.<p>I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really unfair as I didn&#x27;t test it myself, but they hint that there is a wide gap between PCC and NewReno or even CUBIC. The algorithm as I understand it also seems to imply that PCC will dominate a NewReno stream with ease, especially when PCC is an established connection and the NewReno is only starting up as the PCC will feel a small bump of losses, probably not do much about it (i.e. not reduce rate by much) and the NewReno generated packet losses will fly under the radar of PCC.

With Sphinx, you perform the search using the search API and get back some ids, then just query those ids using your standard ORM constructs for getting the (small) set of whatever object/rows you are loading.  Since you are loading small and fixed amounts of data by the primary keys, the performance shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.<p>If you are looking for caching and other more complex features, I&#x27;d recommend elasticsearch (and I do <i>highly</i> recommend it).

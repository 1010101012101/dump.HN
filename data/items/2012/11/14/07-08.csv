4782456,comment,4781894,4782320,1,0,mks,,,"OOP is great when your main focus are data structures. Many enterprise applications are basically just transforming data from one system to another. Being able to come to an unknown code and figure out what is the format of input and output just by reading couple of classes is a godsend. Even in this case use OOP features sparingly (beware of deep hierarchies, contrived polymorphism etc).<p>On the other hand when your problem is more about algorithms and evaluation of data you might choose more functional approach.<p>Hybrid (object+functional) approach is getting even to the enterprise world - SOA suggests to have dumb (possibly immutable) data objects for business objects (just like struct in C) and service objects that perform operations on these data objects (not unlike functional programming). Similar pattern is with dependency injection frameworks that rely heavily on singletons (Spring) - many beans become just containers for stateless functions.<p>OOP is not silver bullet (nothing is for that matter), but it is a very useful tool.",1352879846

Statistically you will just keep losing money because the house always wins - they have the edge - unless you play a game like poker with a bunch of suckers - where the casino still takes a nice chunk of your change.<p>Selling options is like being a casino without the ability to know what the statistics of the underlying distributions or their payoffs are. Nor do you have the ability to kick a guy out if he wins too big and too often. It's a casino without the control. And a casino without control - is a casino that goes bankrupt.",1352879542

You're thinking it of the perspective of the factory owner, not the overall society.<p>In fact, the potential of social unrest in the future increases: all those people, brought over from their villages and left unemployed in the big city, with wages for unskilled labor going down (due to even less demand after the automation of most jobs), and no future, will not end well.<p>><i>In my country we've had miners striking, demanding pretty large increases. My default answer has been to automate the lot and put robots underground, but on the other hand...</i><p>But on the other hand, we have (as a society) exploited the work of those workers at the time that the job could not be automated (which is still the case today mostly), while paying them less that it's worth it.<p>""You'll work for a pittance, and if you argue about it, we will force you to using the police instead of negotiating better wages.""<p>And that in an extremely harsh job, where a huge percentage of miners dies of cancer.",1352877848

4782384,comment,4779844,4781903,4,0,gfodor,,,"Nobody is arguing about the long side of options being ""oh god run for the hills nuclear weapons dangerous"", they are arguing that about the short side (or certain complicated strategies that are long-short.) The long side is just a suckers bet, but it's a relatively low risk one. You buy a $1000 call -- most of the time you lose the $1000. Sometimes you break even. Rarely you make a little money. Once in a blue moon you 2 or 3x your money. (These are the instances you remember and hence you keep buying calls.) In the long run, you lose money (academic studies have shown this.)<p>Where you can really get screwed is going (naked) short. Lets say you shorted a ""modest"" $1000 worth of out-of-the-money GOOG options today with a 8% spread from strike. The $600 Dec 22nd puts right now cost $2.80, so you'd sell 4 contracts for $1120. 8% is plenty of cushion, right? As long as GOOG's price doesn't go down more than 8% before expiration, you'd have $1120 in your pocket. That's a huge drop and highly unlikely. An easy $1120, right? It worked last month and the month before, so why not this time?<p>But oops, lets say just like last time GOOG's earnings leak early because someone fat fingered an email or something, and the stock took an instant 12% haircut. That extra 4% below your strike price just cost you approximately $24 per share. You had 4 contracts, so your options were against 400 shares. You just lost $24 * 400 shares = $9600 in order to make an ""easy"" $1,120.<p>Now, consider the fact that many people are going to be looking to make more than $1,000 a month when trading options. More like $5,000-$10,000. Guess what -- if the market systematically crashes by 10% over a few days because Ben Bernanke sneezed during a speech you could be in the hole for hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on what positions you've taken.<p>Also, if you were to buy closer to-the-expiration options (say, ones expiring next week as opposed to next month), the per-contract costs go down by approx a factor of 10, so you have to sell 10x more contracts in order to get the same gain. But guess what, if your luck is particularly bad and something goes horribly wrong, you can multiply your losses above by a factor of 10. (Yes, Virginia, with options it is possible, nay, easy to have a 10,000% loss in a few minutes on a bad day.)<p>That's how you can get fucked. You keep selling short puts on positions you can't really cover comfortably, and rake in the dough. And then on one sunny otherwise uneventful autumn afternoon something weird happens, and Vegas, er, I mean, Wall Street, takes it all back, and much more.",1352877698

If Flash requires some greater JS performance, or some API gap to be filled, Shumway is the most direct way to find out. It's well within Mozilla Research's ambit, and not backward-looking, to explore this space.<p>Finally, if we can deploy Shumway as a previewer and reduce actual Flashplayer plugin instantiations greatly, with as good or better user experience in terms of jank, CPU utilization, battery life, etc. -- and with some black-video-frame-of-death saves on my iPad, should Shumway be supported there -- that helps in the coming years as Flash lingers on in the ""desktop web"".<p>But make no mistake: the growth curve for mobile devices and the lack of Flash there will kill Flash. All those restaurant sites that sunk their discretionary web content development budgets in Flash years ago? They are re-investing rapidly to work on iOS devices. I don't see Flash rallying on desktop, or even via Air on Android.<p>Add this all up and I believe Shumway can avoid the forever-a-toy status. Flash is proprietary tech, in spite of SWF being opened up in recent years. Its single main implementation code is its spec. This hurts when the single implementation is evolving rapidly, but as that implementation slows down and (outside of Air and games, let's say) declines, the 90%-coverage ""toys"" become real tools, with the right integration.<p>This could have applied to Gnash or swfdec in the past, but at significantly higher cost, not only in direct engineering costs and opportunity costs to web-perf/API-uplift, but also in securing yet more piles of native VM code.<p>/be",1352876593

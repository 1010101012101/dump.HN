But I doubt very much it would look like physics, or have the benefits of physics that Hillis thinks are important.<p>Its much more likely to look like biology, eg nature's computers. Most models in physics are not inherently based on the idea of information and computation, in fact the functions that they are based on are merely primitive recursive, making them unsuitable for for descriptions of fully generally recursive computational processes.<p>Of course, biology is also noted for its lack of higher theory, and so when I make the above claim, the meaning is that when such a theory exists it will address both of these issues.",1210967462

""Every time you download a song, a baby seal is forced to listen to Smells Like Teen Spirit for five hours"", and so on..<p>What it all means is that every single person in Finland who buys a CD-R is considered a criminal in advance, and pays a little tax for it.<p>So if we're already paying for being dirty criminals, why shouldn't we download things too?<p>Well, I've ended up rambling quite a bit about random thoughts, but the idea is to offer a different point of view.<p>The point is that piracy can be both right and wrong.

192118,comment,191907,192065,0,0,jcl,,,"It struck me as quite clever (perhaps too clever, which seems to be a common thread in these recent Thinking Machines articles...).<p>His point, if I'm reading it correctly, is that we treat wires as an ideal and instantaneous transfer medium.  In reality, however, wires take up physical space, so there are physical limits to the number and length of wires you can actually have.  The more wires you use, the longer they need to be to route around each other, hence more time needed to transfer the data, breaking the abstraction.<p>Analogously, a memory location ideally represents something you can dump data into at one time, then extract it instantaneously at a later time.  In reality, however, processors need to address memory via the bus. With a single bus, processors will have to queue their requests -- resulting in longer ""time wires"" and a slower computer.  The alternative is to have multiple memories/buses (more ""time wires""), but since the buses are constrained by physical limits, the number of ""time wires"" you can have is constrained just like the number of real wires.  So our abstraction of memory is broken -- the amount of time it takes to access a memory location depends on how many locations we need.<p>You can see a similar result in today's machines, in the behavior of cache locality: if your algorithm tries to access too much data (many ""time wires""), it overflows the cache and you're forced to wait (use longer ""time wires"").  Algorithms designed to exploit cache effects are sometimes an order of magnitude faster, illustrating the leakiness of our memory abstraction.",1210964631

I changed the focus of the question without backing up my claim by presenting an argument.  So I got second guessed, a logical development.<p>This presents me with a dilemma.  I could present philosophical arguments about why it's wrong or I could just ""wave my hands"" and say it's outside the scope of this thread.<p>People may not like it (and I may lose this ""debate""), but I choose to do the latter.<p>I could cop out and claim that Hacker News is a community for fellow hackers and business people to learn and share together, so a philosophical discussion of right and wrong borders on the religious and doesn't belong here.<p>Or I could say no one would win such a debate, so why bother just getting people upset?<p>I think I'll take the third option, which probably puts me in the worst light, but...<p>If I have to debate right and wrong with you, let's just say that I'd rather not debate at all and move on to doing business with someone who thinks a little more like me.",1210964451

afunnyfunnyman,20,"My Name is Kevin Segel, I grew up on Martha's Vineyard (year around not just the summer) and I graduated from Bentley University in May 2011 with a Major in Information Design and Corporate Communication with a major GPA of 3.7. I also received a minor in Computer Information Systems and have a good understanding of finance, marketing, management, and entrepreneurship.<p>I truly love the field of UX/UI design. I like to describe my work as ""I think so the user doesn't have to"". I am well read in usability research and socio-economics to determine behavior. My current favorite usability task is UX strategy or creating incentive systems to encourage or discourage a type of behavior while not changing the context of the experience.<p>I believe that usability is all about continual improvement. Nothing is ever finished or perfect, projects grow, change and evolve. My goal is to apply that ideology to my profession and to continue to grow, change, and evolve my skill set and expertise.",1314122805,1452896391

Somehow I made my dream come true, as I worked in the TV field for almost 11 years and was the Head of Programming of a Movie Channel.

This can be done in many ways: creating a new application, suggesting an action plan or architecture, optimizing current set-up / architecture / applications, etc.<p>At the moment my technology focus is on PHP, Symfony, AWS, MongoDB, MySQL, APIs, NodeJS and Docker. I also care a lot about security (InfoSec), performance, quality, best practices & continuous learning. You can contact me for projects at http://ifdattic.com<p>I&#x27;m a big believer in Open-Source and the sharing of knowledge. I&#x27;m a contributor to the Symfony framework, Behat, phpspec & several other open-source projects. (see my GitHub: https://github.com/ifdattic)<p>Personally I have strong values which I believe make me a better version of myself. I strongly believe in daily incremental personal improvement - make sure you&#x27;re a better person day by day - never stop learning!<p>Some of those values are:<p>* transparency and sincerity (don&#x27;t lie, don&#x27;t hide things, don&#x27;t be afraid of the truth);\n* learning / self-improvement (you learn most outside of your comfort zone);\n* well-being (“Mens sana in corpore sano” - you produce the best work with a healthy mind and body);\n* servitude (helping others provides more happiness than helping yourself);\n* gratitude (to appreciate what you have);\n* empathy (learn to understand others, and that everyone is having as rich a human experience as you. This helps in doing good and feeling good. I feel travel is important in cultivating my empathy);\n* minimalism / frugality (focus on what is important in life).<p>You can read more about my personal experiences and thoughts on values on my blog: http://ifdattic.com/categories/personal",1424287774,1453166528

4154349,comment,4152539,4153200,4,0,symcthrowaway,,,"So, I also worked on this team (and am good friends with mjard). At some point there was a big decision made to heavily bias the engine against ""unknown"" executables. I said it was a bad idea then, and I still think it is now. The only way it can ""know"" about an executable is via its source, or its signature, or if it is on other users machines. This creates the obvious huge problem for ""the little guy"" distributing software. They actually think this is no big deal, and when it steps on toes, the distributor can just use their dispute system and eventually they will fix it. And if you don't like it, you can just get your software signed. I was of the opinion that this was bad behavior and unreasonable. They really liked what it did for review scores (surprise, we detect everything!). I lost.<p>Create a harmless helloworld.exe and put it on a random website. Download and run it. If things haven't changed since I left, it will get flagged as malware.<p>What I can say is that this has nothing to do with trying to crush the little guy or malice. With some exceptions, there is a general attitude there of not caring, or caring about the wrong things. Hanlon's Razor a little bit.",1340575112

They had their own personal fortunes to play around with (much like Curt Shilling, except they also had backgrounds in shipping very successful software) while they figured things out.<p>However, while Steam is certainly a very big deal now I think it is silly not to mention Half-Life as a very important part of Valve's early success.  Half-Life was very successful and the fact that it, its sequels and the Source engine begat so many related franchises like Counter-Strike is a big part of the reason Steam was able to leverage a huge built-in audience and succeed in its early days while so many would-be-competitors failed.",1340575084

I think that their business exemplifies some of the best of how to conduct an online business (leverage technology massively, but also rely on community goodwill to conduct many business operations, including removing of bad/fraudulent listings).  While I'm not a particular critic of CL's page format  -- they've held to the KISS principle in the extreme -- it's become increasingly clear that for many types of listings, there are some very evident improvements which could be made.<p>My feeling is that CL are squandering an opportunity in their dealings with Padmapper.  The Padmapper interface, for apartment and real-estate listings, is vastly superior to CL's existing listing format.  While there is a business risk to CL in allowing another party to utilize its comprehensive listings (for which CL would reasonably be able to assert compilation copyrights, answering some here), I really believe it would be to CL's benefit to find <i>a reasonable business relationship</i> under which it could utilized Padmapper's interface.  Whether that's a data exchange agreement, a purchase or leasing of the technology, or simply a reinvention of it, I don't particularly care (I also owe Padmapper nothing in particular).<p>And if that's not the case, then, well, CL show a case of a market which, if a feasible business case can be made, is ripe for disruption.",1340574271

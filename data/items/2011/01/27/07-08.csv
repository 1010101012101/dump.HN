2147052,comment,2145453,2145559,0,0,wallflower,,,"Interesting question(s) to ask if you want to cut to the meat of someone's core. The first is ""What is your story?"" and when they naturally stare at you like ""Huh?"" - you answer your own question (prime the pump). Tell them who you are and where you want to go. Reveal some insecurity but confidence. And then you pause and wait confidently for the other person to start talking, with a bit of who they are. Done with honesty, you can cut the smalltalk bullcrap and start talking about what matters in life.<p>The other question: ""When were you last lucky?""<p>Remember success comes from connecting and helping people. Not from not listening",1296115061

I love working next to live music and if I don't' I can ignore it with headphones.  My father, on the other hand, can't handle the distraction and is driven nuts by that sort of shit.<p>b) I try to change it up.  It's easy to do in the localities I frequent.  I'm sure it's harder for other people.  I feel like I could do it anywhere I could get a 3g connection.<p>c) I like to frequent places that are very student and musician friendly, and am lucky to live in places with local businesses which embrace that sort of thing.  In general these people are pretty tolerant of heavy laptop/internet usage.<p>Living in a big student town can cause problems for seating in coffee shops.  Finals week or mid-quarter midterm dates are times when it's particularly impossible to find a place to get some work done.  This has led to some contention with patrons who want space to just read the paper or talk with a friend.

I'll be interested to see how well you're able to retain your better tutors.  Tutoring clientele grows firstly by word of mouth, and if you're a good tutor, you'll inevitably get referrals.  Yet from where I'm sitting there's not a great way to funnel these referrals through TutorSpree (we had a decent way of managing it in our SAT prep world).  There's also nothing preventing a tutor from leaving TutorSpree after, say, a few first lessons with an initial cadre of clients.  So all those $5 rings of the register are lost.<p>This, I think, is a distinguishing feature from Airbnb, as Airbnb efficiently connects a seller with a pool of distant buyers.  The service itself gets primary credit for the connections rather than the individual venue or venue owners due to the nature of individual travel.  Tutoring is a little different.  A tutor produces one happy client, and that client serves as a connector (rather than Tutorspree) to a new pool of students.<p>Nevertheless, the level of support and the quality of the systems you provide to your tutors will play a role in overall retention (client acquisition and payment processing are certainly a start).",1296113763

I pinged one of them on Twitter and I'll pass this article around within Google.<p>Here's my personal opinion: I think the idea of paid inclusion had a deep influence on Google--we really didn't like the idea of paying to be in Google's index, because it meant that Google's incentives would be misaligned (not indexing pages would lead to revenue). I think that some people might have had the same worries about paid user/customer support (messing things up such that people had to call us would lead to revenue). That might sound crazy, but back in 2000 I saw quite a few companies that almost seemed to make deliberately bad software so that they could overcharge on support contracts. [Of course, there's the notion that Google tries to be scalable as well.] In my personal opinion, if anyone had the notion ""we don't want to be paid for support, because that means our incentives are misaligned"" in the early days, that notion is outdated and should be re-examined.

Because then it would be good news instead of bad news!<p>Statistics for U.S. suicides in 2001:\n- Males: 17.6 suicides per 100,000 population.\n- Females: 4.1\n- Overall: 10.8\n(The rate is much higher for males than females, since females have more unsuccessful attempts; men use guns more often, women use pills.)\nSource: <a href=""http://www.suicide.org/suicide-statistics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.suicide.org/suicide-statistics.html</a><p>And from the following reference, we can get the per-capita rate for various branches of the military:<p><a href=""http://ptsdcombat.blogspot.com/2010/04/latest-military-combat-veteran-suicide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ptsdcombat.blogspot.com/2010/04/latest-military-comba...</a><p>Quote: << Eleven active-duty airmen had committed suicide through March 19, which projects to an annual rate of 13.7 suicides per 100,000 airmen. The numbers were already trending upward: The 2008 and 2009 rates were 12.4 and 12.5, after averaging fewer than 10 from 1998 through 2007. By comparison, the Army and Marine Corps had rates last year of 23 and 24. The Navy has not released its 2009 rate, but Air Force Times calculated it at 14.5 using data released by the service. The civilian suicide rate was 10.9 in 2006, the last year for which data are available. ... >><p>But we should really compare against the suicide rate for men, since soldiers are predominantly men. So we have:<p>- General population of men: 17.6 / 100,000\n- Air Force: 13.7 / 100,000\n- Army-Marines: 23-24 / 100,000\n- Navy: 14.5 / 100,000<p>So, other than the Army/Marines, the military suicide rate is LOWER than that of the general male population, and for Army/Marines, the suicide rate is only 36% higher than the general population. This may be attributable to the fact that guys in the Army almost certainly kill themselves with guns, so we'd expect their success rate to be higher than that of the general population.",1296111666

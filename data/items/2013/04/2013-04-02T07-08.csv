This means that if giant butt feathers are destructive towards actual survival, then all the female peacocks sexually selecting for this otherwise useless trait are disadvantaging their offspring and every peacock in on this giant butt feather thing will be disadvantaged.<p>For example, let's introduce a new predator that's also attracted to giant butt feathers. It doesn't matter how sexually attractive those giant butt feathers are, the offspring of giant butt feather peacocks will be at a survival disadvantage and will be selected out of the gene pool. The ones remaining are the female peacocks who don't like giant butt feathers, and their offspring (since they're more likely to not produce giant butt feathers).",1364889542

In a typical stack, we code the server-side model in, say, Ruby on Rails, and duplicate the same model in client-side model in JavaScript so it can detect things like minimum password lengths without sending data back to the server. The holy grail is to have both server-side and client-side in JavaScript and also sharing the models as well, with that we reduce amount of things we have to code.",1364889388

Because it's a meritocracy.<p>No, the meritorious survive because you can't cheat the universe.<p>I'm saying you can't make the world meritocratic because it already is and it's not changeable. You can only align yourself with how the world works so you don't get screwed.<p>For example, let's say I'm an employer and I decide to hire the least competent candidate for a new job. I, as the employer, cannot escape the consequences of this action and most likely I will pay for it in some form like the company failing or me losing my job. The world is still meritocratic despite my inane decision making. This forces me out of the equation and eventually my successor will have to do a better job hiring or else face the same fate of irrelevance as I. Eventually, all that's left is an employer who does pick candidates based on <i>merit</i>. But if this is true, the employer didn't really create a meritocracy, but merely aligned itself with the equilibrium state of the universe.<p>This is just a way of looking at what <i>meritocracy</i> means, and it frames it as a purely practical construct necessary for survival.",1364888913

So I wrote about improving the inputs by examining the prior systems.<p>What I completely missed, and what you alluded to by mentioning people in prison, with bad parents, and so on, is that the present generation of families also have inputs -- the systems that they went through (education, military, commerce, etc.) and their own parents. The issues we have today are partly the results of mistakes made by parents living a hundred, five hundred, even a thousand years ago.<p>It's a depressing thought when expressed that way, but on the bright side, if we do as well as we can given our limited inputs today, we at least give the next generation of parents, teachers and employers a chance to do better than we could possibly have done.",1364888762

5478132,comment,5473128,5474027,2,0,Houshalter,,,"Deflation generally benefits almost everyone. Things get cheaper and cheaper over time, while the amount of money you make stays the same. Technology is a beautiful example of this. Almost every year technology gets cheaper and cheaper, and better and better for the same amount of money spent. And of course this is great for everyone and I don't think many would dispute that.<p>Imagine a world where that wasn't true. Imagine you had to spend more and more every year just to get the same quality of phone or computer or TV. Now ideally, and depending on what's causing the inflation, your income would increase at exactly the same amount and so it wouldn't make a difference. The same quality TV would cost the same percent of your wage in 1960 as it would in 2013.<p>But with deflation it's the opposite. Your income will (on average) remain the same, since the amount of money in the economy hasn't changed and it's being divided over the same number of people. But prices will go down due to the economy growing, increasing efficiency, technological improvements, and all that good stuff.<p>You may see a slight flaw in my argument. Presumably the same amount of stuff is being produced in both economies, regardless how the currency is changing in value over time, and presumably there are the same amount of people to receive all the stuff being produced. So how can people in the deflationary economy be richer, on average, than people in the inflationary one?<p>Well <i>on average</i>, they aren't. Inflation as you are talking about it is caused by the money supply increasing. Usually due to the government printing more. Whoever gets the money first is suddenly richer, because prices haven't increased in response to inflation yet. The amount of money they have relative to everyone else has increased. Therefore everyone else has become poorer relative to them.<p>Only on average does everything stay the same, but it's a zero sum game where for one person to benefit, someone else has to lose. The amount of goods in the economy hasn't changed. But the person with more money (obtained through printing money) gets a bigger piece of the pie and therefore everyone else gets less.<p>Inflation is just a really confusing, inefficient, and indirect form of wealth redistribution. Whoever gets the printed money obviously gets to benefit from it, and everyone else is therefore poorer, including your entrepreneurs and investors and consumers and everyone else.<p>The only way this isn't true is if the money is distributed perfectly equally so the percentage everyone has is exactly the same as before. However this is not the case in the real world at all.",1364888327

In both cases, the long run damage to the human race or individual societies is unknown.<p>Perhaps the only solution is the minimum one.

5478091,comment,5477937,5478042,3,0,Udo,,,"Like most ethics questions, I'd consider this area a matter of degrees. We probably have an easier time saying that ensuring your child's health and integrity <i>is</i> an ethical endeavor.  Maximizing your child's stats on the other hand is probably questionable, not only because this has been associated with evil in the past, but also because we're not really all that good at judging consequences.<p>With this, somewhat tenuous, idea of the upper end of the ethical spectrum in mind, it's easier to see that intentionally hurting your child is bad. Again, at the most extreme end, the bottom is made up of people who commit a willful physical act to rob their child of health and happiness. This is quite common post birth, but now it's also increasingly feasible to do in the womb. I'd say removing a child's hearing is in the same league as, say, removing a child's genitals (which is also common in large parts of the world). It's a malevolent act designed to rob your child of some aspect of its humanity, and the motives are also similar (""I want my child to be the same as me!"", ""I think it's better that way"").<p>Slightly towards the gray area of the spectrum, but still by far on the negative side, are in my opinion people who willingly and intentionally pass on catastrophic genes to their children. It's really not all that different, except I'd compare it more to shooting a person with a weapon at a distance, where the former examples are more like pulling a knife and butchering someone with your own hands (in some cases literally).<p>Now, your second question is the most interesting in my opinion. Is creating a child ethical at all because its suffering and eventual premature death seems predestined anyway? I'd argue that life - even at our current, very limited tech level - <i>is</i> indeed worth living and all things considered a positive thing. As badly designed as we are by nature, we're still a comparatively nice and diverse organism with amazing capabilities. And for a child born today, I hope that senescence will become a solvable problem within its lifetime.",1364887381

Consider that this is a field of knowledge that is exponentially evolving every year, and you will need years before you are comfortable with it. Learning code or computer science is a long term decision, and you should go for it if you really see yourself doing it as a hobby. If you are not up for it, better learn web design or something that relies less on programming;<p>- Following my previous point, start by learning the basics of computer science. You will not understand the abstract concepts, or know what you are doing before you have the theory basis behind it  You will get unmotivated faster. How fun is it to play a guitar without knowing music theory? There are dozens of ways to learn CS, and I personally find the CS50x class from EdX the best source to start;<p>- If you don't like math, well.. start liking it! Part of the enjoyment of programming is the satisfaction you get from solving problems. Read books about algorithms and/or take the online classes in Coursera or Udacity. Also make Project Euler as a daily visit, and try to solve several challenges per week;<p>- Again, start small, and go small every step. Make a structured plan of what you want to learn, such as ""Monday I study Python, Tuesday for Algorithms, Wednesday for CS.."". Take advantage of dozens of courses available in Coursera, Udacidy and EdX.<p>- Part of learning anything is making yourself motivated along the way. You should study at least 10h per week (I work full-time and I never study less than that) and make your successes visible, such as placing a post-it with every online course you completed in a wall;<p>Btw, I studied Economics for 5 years and I am 24.

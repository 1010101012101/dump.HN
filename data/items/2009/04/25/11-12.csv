578838,story,,,6,12,csomar,"Ask HN : Best location for new freelancer",,"I decided to try freelancing while studying on university. I plan to work as a developer and study programming in the same time to develop my knowledge. That's a decision.<p>I live in Tunisia, where I can't get a Paypal account, a credit card and also there's no much opportunities for freelancers here. In university, I'm more (much more) competent that profesor them selfs. Another problem, you can't work here without degree, employers don't look on what you have in hand, but on the papers you get.<p>So I decided to change location and study in another country. The problem, I can't select one. I don't know which one is best.\nSome people says the USA, but others says that it's expensive. Another problem is to get VISA.<p>I'm looking for idea and suggestions, if you have such experience in travelling, I'm looking for a place<p>* Not very cheap, not expensive, a total spending of $1,000 a month is good for me.<p>* I can easily get Paypal, credit card. Also there's a good internet connection<p>* Good and serious universities, also more IT opportunities.<p>* Mental Capital people (cyber mind), that I can meet and do mutual projects.<p>Does any one have an idea, please?<p>If you have an article, report, or anything useful in the internet, please point to it.",1240660174

578834,comment,578339,578339,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I personally love that people associate the end of the Mayan <i>short</i> calender (most people claim it as their predictive end of the world, when in reality their long calender ended millions of years in the future) with the end of the world. The Mayans associated the end of the short calender as a party, because a new b'ak'tun was to them like the new millennium was to us.<p>We're about to hit the 13th b'ak'tun, which some people claim is the end of the calender. However, it's generally regarded the count is supposed to go up to 19 b'ak'tun (they counted 0). Incidentally the end of the 20 b'ak'tun will be in the year 4,376.<p>What all the end of the world nuts are too ignorant to see when they obsess over these things, is that despite the end of their calender being thousands of years in the future, they'd already fixed the problem. There's four larger integers in their calender: piktun, kalabtun, k'inchiltun, and alautun. If the b'ak'tun is in fact a cycle of 20 then each of these are also a cycle of 20. This puts the end of the world about 400 million years away, which is probably very close to when the Earth will actually be uninhabitable as in about 1 billion years the sun will have gotten so hot that the oceans will have evaporated.<p>I give no credence to this guys argument, first he has no clue how the Mayan calender works, just like all doomsayers, they only see what they want. The fact that the earth hasn't ended in the 23 previous solar cycles that we've recorded, seems to lend credence that the 24th won't end it either. Just because it's the end of the Mayan short calender doesn't make it in the least bit more special.<p>My prediction, this is another load of bunk, just like the predictions that the world would end in 1999, 2000 and pretty much every year.",1240659662

578828,comment,578339,578730,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Of course, it's not all environmental.<p>I live in Kansas. There's a long-running feud going (several years now) over permits to build several coal-fired power plants in the western part of the state; the legislature keeps passing bills ordering the permits to be granted, and the governor keeps vetoing them (thus far the legislature's been unable to get enough votes to override her).<p>While various folks here love to complain that it's just some sort of environmental agenda being pushed by our (liberal) governor, there's a powerful economic reason to say no to these plants: although they'll be built in Kansas, although they'll use resources from Kansas, although they'll dump pollution into the air and water of Kansas, not one single watt of power from them will go to homes or businesses in Kansas (the plants, if they're built, will be built by out-of-state power companies to produce electricity which will be used elsewhere, mostly in Colorado).<p>Which raises a valid question: if Kansas is going to bear the cost of having these plants, why shouldn't Kansas get any of the benefits? They won't generate nearly enough jobs to cover the impact they'll have on the state in other ways, so I don't see how any sound economic argument can be made in their favor.<p>From what reading I've been able to do on the subject of power-plant construction, it seems Kansas isn't alone in facing this sort of situation. Though it may feel like a variation on NIMBY, I think it's entirely reasonable for one state to ask why it should bear costs while another reaps benefits, and to refuse to enter such an obviously one-sided deal.",1240658384

We use email for two things nowadays: interpersonal communication and event notifications. The fact that they both end up in our inboxes is more by accident than by design, and a really good email client should probably separate the two to some degree.",1240658365

That alone would be an incentive to upgrade to W7.<p>Classic on OS X worked the same way, too: a Classic app could take down the entire Classic environment, but OS X would safely charge on apace. This was definitely something that helped drive people to upgrade.",1240658227

578820,comment,578755,578815,0,0,bonaldi,,,"Conversations. You know, that threading-done-right they have that people love -- with a few holdouts -- but that no other email client has yet done correctly (and, no, an indented list of message titles isn't nearly the same thing, nor is IMAP THREAD's ""same subject? Must be the same thread!"").<p>There's a fair amount of deduction goes into Gmail's conversation ordering -- it's quite hard to fool -- and an API that allowed you to treat conversations as the primary unit instead of messages would be great.<p>This article is right that the inbox needs to get smarter, and GMail is the closest to it yet. But while they're furiously adding frills around the outside, they've made very little changes of the sort suggested. Even easy things are missing: eg, why can't I click on a ""from"" header and automatically see all messages sent from that person?<p>In fact, it's mostly small changes like this that could bring GMail much closer to what the author is looking for. Sure, being able to pull in Facebook interactions isn't going to happen, but a desktop client could certainly do that. Which brings us back to hoping for a GMail API.",1240657275

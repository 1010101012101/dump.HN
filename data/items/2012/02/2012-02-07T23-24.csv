3564296,comment,3563706,3563954,5,0,mvanveen,,,"> Flickr is a sinking ship. Great. Why? Why do we have any reason to believe Snapjoy is going to outlast Flickr?<p><pre><code>  s/Flickr/del\.icio\.us/g
  s/SnapJoy/pinboard/g
</code></pre>
For the regex-impaired, swap Flickr with delicious and Snapjoy with pinboard.<p>When I found out that del.icio.us was falling apart, the discovery of pinboard was a remarkable discovery!  The founder posted a link to a migration tool that allowed me painlessly keep thousands of my old bookmarks.  Just by itself that was reason enough for me to support them.<p>I can't speak to the long term viability of pinboard or SnapJoy, but that's true of a lot of web services, frankly.  A few years ago you would've seemed crazy for calling Flickr a ""sinking ship.""",1328659168

This family of editors contains a command infrastructure meant to avoid the waste of paper on a teletype terminal (ed's original display device).<p>And how do I know this? I used ed, and an early version of vi, years ago during my NASA engineering days in the 1970s, while designing part of the Space Shuttle. All those separate vi modes -- insert, delete, move the cursor, and others -- originated in ed, at a time when it was a priority to assist the operator while typing blind, before wasting another 11 inches of paper just to see how it all turned out. The first version of vi was screen oriented, but it carried over the original separate modes, and kept them separate.<p>When I wrote the first version of Apple Writer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer</a>) in 1979, people had a hard time adjusting to an editor that allowed you to insert, delete and move the cursor without changing modes. It seemed a rather simple idea to me, but at the time, among vi users, it was met with shock and disbelief.<p>And here we are, over 30 years later, and people are still learning vi/Vim, as though it represents cutting edge technology.<p>I think we should hold a wake for vi/Vim, and maybe we should invite Fortran to the party.",1328657785

For the past 2 years, I joined a startup that looked to get into the retail mobile scene.  Over the past two years, I've worked extremely hard for this company and helped develop several technologies for them.  For my hard work, they award me a percentage of the company for every year I'm with them and cover some expenses.<p>Lately, I feel very disconnected from the company.  The work isn't is as fun or exciting as it was before.  My last project, felt unstructured and a lot of miscommunication occurred and deadlines slipped.

I think this assessment was fair and they agreed that in order to help me grow, we should structure to my week and have weekly reviews regarding my objectives.<p>I want to ask HN, how do you deal with such growing pains?  Sometimes I feel the founders say one thing but then do another. Instead of helping me grow, I feel they're just to busy, and I look to my colleagues for help.

But I haven't seen anyone respond in the negative as to why they DON'T contribute so I'll take a stab.<p>I've asked a few developers this question and the reasons for not contributing tended to fall into 3 camps:<p>1. Not enough time.  These folks come home from a long day coding at work and want to spend their free time with family/friends.<p>2. Not enough interest.  They're not opposed to the idea of contributing, but 'just never got around to it'.<p>3. Not sure where to start.  This was particularly true among younger developers.  They'd be interested in joining a project to improve their skills and work w/ others, but they weren't sure how to get started.  What should they work on?  Where is the project headed? If they just start hacking on stuff, will the lead contributor find it useful?<p>I don't think there's much you can do to change the first reason for not contributing (no time).  But I think if Open source projects had better communication tools, possibly the second, and definitely the third reasons could be addressed.<p>I'm working on a pre-launch startup to make it easier for open source teams to better collaborate and communicate with each other.  We want to create a space where developers can have face-to-face meetings, code reviews, and pair with new programmers to get them up to speed.<p>You can see the prototype at www.codemeet.com.

I prepared four. One of them was to develop a system like this one and to test it on first year students.<p>My hypothesis was that, like natural language, artificial languages require a command of grammar (syntax) and vocabulary (reserved words, library methods) to create ""fluency"".<p>I proposed to test that hypothesis by dividing a first year class into two groups, one using a spaced-repetition tool and one learning on their own. Learning performance would be tested in two ways: looking at the scores of the two groups, and applying various size metrics (SLOCs, gzipped size, Halstead's etc) to their submitted code. The latter because presumably, a student who knew the standard library well wouldn't reinvent too many wheels.<p>I didn't pursue the project because it wouldn't have been feasible to do in a single year. There were also potential problems with contamination between groups, non-compliance of the tool-using group and of course it would need to go to the ethics board and the academic board. One professor suggested that it would make a workable Masters project.<p>edit: I'd be happy to forward the proposal to anyone who wanted a squiz.<p>edit 2: Or not.

It also uses a spaced retention algorithm, and I've become accustomed to simply keeping it open at all times. Whenever I learn something new, I add it to the relevant Anki deck. This is the best way I've discovered to fight the erosion of my knowledge in the face of the growing proliferation of frameworks/languages.",1328655824

At 29 y/o I command an hourly wage that puts me in something like the top .05% of humanity, I have a gf I love, etc.<p>And, I am an introvert.  I am <i>also</i> a tiny bit shy with folks I don't know.<p>I think my ability to navigate a loud, look-at-me world comes chiefly from self awareness and really just NGAF.<p>Put in a high-schoolesque way; the key to being a succesful introvert is by coming across as mysterious rather than boring.  There can be an inherent urge to justify ones actions when confronted with things like 'why are you so quiet.. or you havent said much over there..'.<p>The difference between blubbering and trying to defend yourself with excuses and calmly showing your palms, or saying 'im just listening' is the difference between someone who knows who they are and someone who doesn't.<p>I think really though the title of this submission/article is generally implying something that isn't so true: that it is particularly difficult to succeed as an introvert.  The advice for an introvert is really the same as an extrovert: do what you are good at and what you like to do; and don't spend so much time and effort on things you don't like.",1328655813

I did both design and development, and worked pretty hard to refine the touch and swipe gestures so it feels very close to the actual iPhone home screen interface. It's meant to be installed on an iPhone in order to fool someone to think they're using an actual iPhone, but when you try to open an app, depending on which one you select, you'll get exploding app icons, loss of gravity, cute kittens, or a scary zombie.<p>I'd love some feedback, and I'd actually love for you to try it on a friend or family member and let me know their reaction.<p>Thanks much!",1328655756

Unless I'm mistaken, Warren Buffet makes money from the ownership he holds, <i>not</i> as a salary, so the assumption people make (""of course he pays more"", ""what, he doesn't?!"") is because they assume he's an employee and equal in everything but the amount, which isn't the case. He makes his money (a variable amount) from ownership, not work. If you prefaced the statement with an explanation of how he pays capital gains and not income tax because of the different <i>types</i> of money nobody would be confused / surprised.",1328655709

Personally, I can't take the bloat and feature-creep that has turned Flickr into a giant hassle. Just getting your photos into Flickr has been a hurdle from day one, with no official app for iPhoto.<p>That's not to say there aren't Snapjoy features I want to see: the ability to create/share collections that span multiple dates/moments is at the top of the list.<p>But as soon as I started using Snapjoy I knew it had massive potential. I especially love the default timeline view, it puts just enough structure around your photos for discoverability, etc.<p>EDIT: I would love to be able to pay annually and save, though. $15 month is a lot of coin for a non-business app.",1328655658

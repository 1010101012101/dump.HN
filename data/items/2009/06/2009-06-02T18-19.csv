I'm mostly a C and Perl person, and once a library is available I've never noticed cases where something was much simpler to write in one than the other.  That library might take more time to write in C than Perl, but once it's written I find it just about (less than a factor of 2?) as easy to write the application logic in C as in Perl.

There's no reason that it can't be handling other requests while waiting for a DB response or a pipe""<p>If your request-handling logic is responsible for concurrent requests, your application (and the platform it runs on) is poorly designed. This belongs to a thread/process dispatch mechanism in the platform, not inside your app. When one thread waits for the database, I am sure the processors can be busy with other requests.<p>""Scaling Rails is a nightmare.""<p>No. It's not. There is little reason for it to be. While I am no Rails expert (I use Django and was a Plone guy not that long ago), the scalability issues most people have happen because of RDBMS concurrency much more than any problem with Rails itself. Like I said before, that time spent waiting for the database to respond is time spent in the database working. It is incredibly rare to have a front-end having heavier usage than the database that feeds it.<p>If you want your applications to scale, design it around the database limitations. Use C, C++ (I would prefer ObjC), Java or Assembly if you want, but faster request processing won't get you past database scalability issues.<p>Using C* or Java will only push back your release date.",1243968744

Your asserted arguments for dynamic languages are well-trodden ground:<p>Assertion:  <i>""Some scripting languages are as fast as compiled languages.""</i><p>No, not really.  I challenge you to prove that statement with a non-trivial benchmark.<p>Assertion:  <i>""most of the time, web apps are waiting for something external to respond""</i><p>This doesn't survive a few seconds of thoughtful analysis.  If a web app is spending most of it's time blocking for I/O, it's poorly designed.  There's no reason that it can't be handling other requests while waiting for a DB response or a pipe.  And once you've allowed for that possibility, you're back to a situation where you can handle more requests with faster software.<p>Empirically, this is obviously true:  languages like Ruby and Python don't hold a candle to Java when it comes to web application speed.  We choose them because of developer convenience, nothing more.  Which brings us to...<p>Assertion:  <i>""C programming is terrifically slow for development. <insert snarky comment about Rails applications with a million users here>""</i><p>Ignoring the fact that there are <i>other</i> compiled languages than C (that are probably better choices for web development), I can tell you from experience that by the time your Rails app reaches a million registered users, 80% of your week is going to be spent either working around the myriad scalability flaws in Rails and the dog-slow nature of Ruby, or installing hardware to accommodate the load.  Scaling Rails is a nightmare.<p>Now, it may be true that you can develop that Rails app a bit faster than you could a webapp in a compiled language, but it's a <i>wild</i> exaggeration to suggest that the difference is more than a few weeks of skilled developer time.  It's a fallacy to imply that all compiled-code projects end up in death-march hell.  Truth be told, the real reason that web apps can be written so quickly is because they're <i>easy</i>, and they tolerate a lot of development error.

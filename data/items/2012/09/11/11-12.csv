Obviously if we could prove them guilty we wouldn't need Gitmo, we'd try them in criminal court.  We didn't because we had nothing on them.<p>Also, your ""went <i>back</i> to killing"" is an assumption.  How do you know they were killing before?

As a general rule, if I can see the entire lifetime of a variable in my field of view, I'll go for short/terse variable names (loop control, temp values, etc). Or if the method name is descriptive, and the code in the method is fairly short, I won't need to repeat myself in the variable names. Good sense is key.<p>Also, the names used in the article show a very poor aesthetic sense. Names like that are screaming out as needing a refactor. Having a condition in your method name is a code smell. Your methods (read: api) should be abstracted as discreet actions, and the code that calls it should perform control flow.",1347364753

In fact, very few businesses across any industry ever reach this milestone.

Would you mind share some tips?<p>In my experience (father of a <2 year old):<p>* work when the kids are sleep or in daycare\n* don't work all the other time (I usually check email, server status and such minor tasks)<p>My daughter gets 11-12h at night and a couple of hours of nap. So, I always try to adapt around her schedule:<p><pre><code>    9,30h - 13h day care\n    14h - 16h nap\n    21h - 8,30h sleep\n</code></pre>\nI started working at 21h at first. This started messing with the mother schedule and staying up late is not always the best solution. Although it's the most quite time.<p>So i ended up waking up as soon as possible everyday, coffee up and start working for a couple hours before they woke up. Then I'll take her to daycare (which takes 12min*2 walking) to get a mental break, came back home and working till 12h30 when I go back to pick her up.<p>Then I usually take a nap with her. Then park time, then bath and dinner, then I'll check if everything's ok (altough I keep checking with the smartphone every now and then). I cannot get any job done when she's playing/""idling"" around the house.<p>And that is the only tip I could share right now (TLDR): start working really early in the morning before anyone wakes up.",1347364352

Is a gain of 10x over a year a 1 out of 1000 event, which would make it likely for a couple Nasdaq stocks a year?  What about 100x returns over a larger number of years?  I'd guess that it's happened at least a few times, but don't know.<p>My instinct would be that it's a fat tail, but not as fat as the VC market.  Rather than hoping for 10x over 10 years (26% year-over-year) with carefully chosen startups, with a broad market index you'd probably lucky to hit 3x (12% compounded).<p>But what would the long term expected returns be for a broad portfolio of mining companies, pre-trial pharmaceuticals, and internet IPO's?

I spend most of my days writing Python code with either Django or Pyramid and also have problems with it from time to time. Though I consider Python my ""favorite"" language it's far from perfect!

4504799,comment,4503927,4504464,4,0,takluyver,,,"> In the UK, there are magazines on every shelf in every newsagent pushing Linux and in every PC related stored they are pretty much giving Ubuntu away (yes they even had a box at the checkout in PC World with free CDs - completely untouched). You can buy PC's with it preinstalled and buy PCs with no operating system so you can install it.<p>Is this the same UK I live in? The newsagents I see might have one Linux magazine lurking behind the iPad magazines. And you really have to go looking for computers that come with Linux preinstalled or no OS. Dell stopped offering them online, and I haven't seen a Linux PC in a retail store since the brief wave of Linux netbooks. I found a small business that sold me a computer with my choice of distro on, but they didn't really promote the option at all.<p>> If you forcibly removed the bundling, you are going to get nowhere i.e. people saying ""Can I just have it with Windows on it""<p>""Sure, that will be 20 extra"" (a complete guess at the OEM Windows price)<p>Obviously preinstalled Linux systems aren't going to topple Windows overnight - there's a lot of network effects and familiarity there. But at the same time, it would definitely benefit Linux adoption if consumers regularly saw an option to use Ubuntu, say, with known-good hardware and without having to install it themselves. Not many would take it at first, but a few people would go home and look it up.<p>> Everyone knows what Linux is or has heard of it.<p>Many people have heard of it, certainly, but they often have some vague idea that it's a command-line interface for ultra nerdy experts. That's why Android and Ubuntu both avoid using the word 'Linux' in their public branding.",1347362469

It's unpleasant and verbose, but the early Java community had real language designers, and even some heavyweights, behind it (including Odersky, designer of Scala) and believe me, they've made more good decisions than bad ones. (Language design is hard, yo.) They got Unicode right in a time where expert language designers had their heads in the sand on that one (UTF-16 is annoying, but it's a hell of a lot better than byte arrays and strings living in the same type.) However, Java was inevitably hijacked by the ""commodity programmer"" culture where businessmen make decisions based on risk-limiting amid mediocrity rather than clearing barriers and allowing excellence (as well as a few non-starters, cf. Paul Graham's notion of ""Black Swan Farming"") to shine. It's not a fun language to use, and the community that has grown up around it since its inception has shown bad taste (J2EE, Maven, Eclipse). But for a period of about a decade, Java was the best (if not only) choice for a variety of problems.<p>Also, Java managed to succeed in the enterprise by feasting on Cobol's corpse, but it built up a Detroit: a good-enough but unattractive infrastructure that thrives when people have solid economic reasons to care about it, then is abandoned rapidly when the context changes.<p>Groovy, Scala, and Clojure came out of an interesting insight: there's some stuff in the JVM ecosystem that's too valuable to abandon just because the Java language is (albeit slowly) dying. It'll be interesting to see how these languages evolve in the next 15 years. Clojure is (IMO) the best Lisp, and Scala is exciting as well... but there's a lot of cultural legacy to deal with (there's plenty of bad Scala code being written by recently-promoted Java programmers; most of them will improve massively as they get a hang of the language, I hope.)

Or when some exec gets mad at people who clock in at 10 (""2 hours late!!"") without realizing they fought some server or deadline until 3am.",1347361234

I'm doing a PhD because I like scientific research and can't stand the thought of being a process engineer.  If I'm going to spend 8 hours a day working on something for the rest of my life, it better be something I enjoy!  While it is possible to do R&D with a bachelor's degree, your chances of being able to do exactly the kind of research you want goes up significantly with a PhD, plus you've already had the experience of doing it for 4 years.<p>Also, I'm not sure where this ""not much money"" concept comes from anyway.

Naively, it seems you can't sync traffic in both directions of a 2-way street at the same time -- e.g. eastbound and westbound.<p>Two things I've thought of that would work for both directions:<p>1) if it's a square grid, you could pick some streets that are optimized westbound, and some eastbound, for example.  And then carefully arrange those so the north-south streets also mesh with it.<p>2) if you can space the lights the right distance apart, you could create a ""standing wave"" where it <i>is</i> actually optimized both ways.  But you'd have to space them farther apart and more regularly than in real cities.  For example, you could set lights apart by 1 minute travel time at 30mph, if the signal cycle is 1 minute.<p>I'm curious what other solutions are to this, and how they do it in a place like LA in practice!",1361404558

- Everything on craigslist is anonymous which makes it difficult to trust the person that you're buying from. plus by removing anonymity it makes it easier to fight spam. (and a lot of other issues regarding user experience, etc.) For example, I believe a real time messaging system would really improve the way people use it and make it more like a real marketplace.<p>- I also think there are some innovation still left in the auctions. it might be a good idea to have a central auction system and build apps based on it for different kinds of categories, so you have different and adapted UI for different categories. Also, it might be possible to make it free for buyers and sellers (without taking any cut from them like eBay) and use some ads that don't clutter the website.<p>I realize that it's probably impossible to compete with these 2 companies given the network effects and competing with them isn't justified by some extra features.<p>So I'm wondering if you have any suggestions to give me ?

It was an adult-oriented <i>standalone</i> console that worked well as a media center and it was also really well designed. It was true to the spirit of old Sony electronics - a self-sufficient device with a polished interface that matched its function. Sure it had a hook up to the Internet and PSN, but it was secondary. But then they started ""improving"" things. First, you got promo ads in the corner of the home screen. Never asked for a permission, no way to turn them off, even by disabling the network connection. So <i>my</i> device was little bit less mine. Then they started pushing ""selected apps""- Netflix-Shmetflix and what not. Again, without asking, just because it was good for me, and, again, the device became even less mine. At the same time they increased the font size and replaced that beautiful Navier-Stokes visualization of a loading indicator with some generic spinner clock thingy. Sprinkled some other crap over the UI.<p>Just now imagine your old Sony cassette deck deciding to show you ads for new Justin Bieber album and offering to share shit on Facebook.

5254247,comment,5253176,5254038,5,0,wfn,,,"Depends on your definition of 'name' and your system/formalization of the act of reference and/or semantics.<p>In this case, 'name' seems to mean 'proper name', and there are systems explaining proper names as symbols used to <i>refer</i>, but not to carry semantic charge (whatever that would entail). For example in my native tongue many town names are named after rivers large and small that do - or - only used to flow next to / past those towns. Yet we don't suddenly change the proper name: the <i>reference</i> still works, but we do not need to cognize the semantic contents (originally associated with the name, if that was the case anyway; if you know where Baroomghtown is, I can use the term to refer to it and my reference will succeed as it were).<p>That was a mouthful. My (insignificant) point: perhaps they would only need cognitive machinery for referring to (in some simple(?) sense) / distinguishing between themselves. That is: (1) usage of proper names does not (necessarily) imply ability to speak a language (perhaps that's all I meant; talk about nitpicking..); (2) there's quite a lot of research showing that animals form concepts left and right (could dig something up, but googling under those keywords would yield enough). Consider this interesting report:<p><pre><code>  Under Pepperbergs patient tutelage, Alex [a parrot] learned how to use his vocal tract to imitate almost one hundred English words, including the sounds for all of these foods, although he calls an apple a banerry.

  Apples taste a little bit like bananas to him, and they look a little bit like cherries, so Alex made up that word for them, Pepperberg said.

The Model S' specificity probably hinders it in this case, since people would naturally build in some buffer in the cases where they have to read an imprecise readout. Since the range readout is so precise, the expanding range is definitely a kink that needs to be worked out.<p>Edit: My gasoline car will sometimes show my tank as almost empty when I first turn it on, but over the next 10 minutes, will slowly but magically reveal much more gas in the tank. I don't think it's unacceptable to have any kinks whatsoever in a car... they're pretty common actually.

There are many many industries and activities that need to be individually regulated. Let's take a few examples of very specific, arcane laws that are important for everyday people who might not even know about them.<p>1.
Suppose you buy a home, and in the bathroom, there is an exhaust fan. You use that fan for years, and one day discover that it has been venting into your attic, and that your attic is thus absolutely full of toxic mold that will cost a small fortune to remove. And if you don't remove it, you're endangering your health and possibly making your house unsellable.<p>As it turns out, most jurisdictions in the US require, by way of the building code, that bathroom exhaust fans be vented directly outside. Had that law been in place in your jurisdiction, perhaps you wouldn't have a mold problem today.<p>2.
Now imagine the FTC doesn't exist, or perhaps that its regulations are vastly simplified. You have a pension plan. You don't pay much attention to how your pension fund is invested. One day, you see on the news that your pension fund has dropped in value by 50%. It turns out the plan was heavily invested in a certain company that looked good in its prospectus but was actually in very bad shape.<p>If today's FTC existed, with its complex and obscure regulations on how a company must report its financial state, perhaps your pension fund managers would have been able to make a better decision.<p>3.
Now suppose you rent an apartment. Your landlord turns the heat way down for no apparent reason, and it's 50 degrees in your unit all the time.<p>In many jurisdictions, there are laws requiring landlords to provide a minimum level of heating. With such a law in place, you could force the landlord to turn the heat back up.<p>=========<p>Each of these examples hinges on a law that most people will probably never think about. Yet you may indeed benefit from them many times in your life, without ever knowing it.<p>It could also be argued that such laws are not guaranteed to prevent the negative outcomes imagined above. This is true. No law will be obeyed 100% of the time. But that doesn't make them useless. Laws can and do influence behavior--when they come with an adequate enforcement mechanism, that is.",1361404050

5254225,comment,5251797,5253359,4,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"I generally agree with you about the necessity of complexity, but the ""law"" of the internet is actually a counterexample: Nobody enforces it. If you want to start with something that vaguely resembles HTML and make a bunch of changes and call it XML and start using it, nobody comes to your door with a warrant for your arrest and locks you in a cell, or even sues you for breach of contract. It's quintessentially private ordering, where everybody does it the same (to the extent that they do) <i>voluntarily</i> because in those cases compatibility with others is more advantageous than diverging from the standard.<p>And it is probably worth looking through the laws for instances where consensus-based processes like that could, perhaps not eliminate, but move some of the complexity from the regulatory system where it serves as a trap for the unwary into voluntary standards that work because it's in everyone's interest to follow them.<p>At the same time, you can still have a set of guidelines and issue warnings (but not penalties) for violations so that people will have notice that if the evil the guidelines are intended to prevent occurs as a result of their violation they'll be responsible for it. Sort of like a compiler warning. But if no evil results because you're doing something sensible but merely unanticipated, or because you've taken some alternative precautions with similar effectiveness, then no penalty would attach as long as no evil occurs.<p>This approach probably works best where the consequences of a violation don't involve risk of physical harm. Allowing a certain amount of risk of economic harm that the perpetrator is required to compensate for or be punished for causing in the event it occurs is much more palatable than the same when the risk is physical injury, because economic harm can be perfectly compensated for or insured against in ways that physical injury obviously can't.",1361404006

Most of the run of the mill ones could be tracked down pretty quickly, but there were still plenty of painful ones. What made them easier to track down was a more advanced tracking/logging system for the simulation state history. The simulation was littered with tons of sync logging code that tracked the execution flow and values of things as they were calculated/updated. When the state went out of sync, all the machines would dump their last couple updates worth of logging (often several gigs) and you could diff them to see where things diverged. If you were making a synced simulation game, a nicely done version of this type of thing would be pretty useful to have, especially if you made a good diff tool to go with it.<p>It's not completely obvious what technology you could make that would make it easier to avoid sync bugs in the first place. You could make a good network command-passing and simulation timing library, but in my experience the majority of problems did not come from bugs with the networking itself.  Most of the sync bugs were from things like uninitialized variables, memory overwrites, using user input or other local machine state directly in the simulation without going through a multiplayer command, using a non-synced random number generator in the sim, DirectX changing the FPU rounding mode on you, etc. (Using a ""safer"" language would help with stuff like uninitialized variables/memory overwrites of course, but at an inevitable performance cost. Static code analysis tools are pretty good at finding these type of problems now too.)",1361403647

He then dismisses this, as if the idea were absurd.
I also see a lot of Singularatarian types with nearly religious fervor with comments like: ""If others perceive you to be inattentive because you check your phone, that's old-world thinking.""
Now, upthread, joe_the_user makes a rather important point that the changes which we're discussing here impact younger generations the most, it's not the old farts who are used to the next big thing, but the children who have no natural resistance to the addictive stimuli.
  Back to the television. While Silverbax88, one of the self-admitted ""old farts"" was not drawn in by the evil TV monster, it strikes me as a child of the nineties as completely disingenuous to assert that a sea-change did not take place in terms of consumption of television, and specifically on how the increased consumption of TV time correlated with a dramatic drop-off in social interaction.<p>I refer specifically to my generational cohort, and how I observed our outside time diminishing as we got older. I remember many afternoons in 1998-99 playing Duke Nukem 3d for hours and being prompted by parents with phrases like, ""Don't you want to go out and play with your friends?"" something I thought especially silly the few times I would go out and no one would be outside as they were all... playing video games and watching TV.<p>This is hacker news, not anecdote TV, so let's see if I can dig up some actual statistics:<p>According to Vandewater, Bickham, and Lee [1] :<p>Results indicated that time spent watching television both with and without parents or siblings was negatively related to time spent with parents or siblings, respectively, in other activities. Television viewing also was negatively related to time spent doing homework for 7- to 12-year-olds and negatively related to creative play, especially among very young children (younger than 5 years). There was no relationship between time spent watching television and time spent reading (or being read to) or to time spent in active play.<p>So we're left in an interesting situation. On one hand we have a lot of people who are concerned over the explosion of potentially isolating technologies, and on the other we have people who seem to blindly assert that everything will be dandy, because, you know it always has been before.
Who do we consider conservative here?<p>To bring this to sort of a close: I feel the same sort of fundamental discomfort as does artursapek with the concept of replacing socialization, something which I've only recently began to really embrace as a nerd, with an electronically mediated digital analogue.
While researching my TV statistic, I saw a lot more papers about the PC-accessed Internet, which I think to be a better metaphor for Google Glass than TV ever was. A lot of these papers such as [2] come to conclusions like:

And the parents of the generation before that were probably appalled at all the drugs and concerts. Etc.<p>And it wasn't just the parents. I'm sure there were conservative kids who were appalled at their peers as well. That isn't exactly a new phenomenon. I was picked on as a kid for being an early adopter of internet chat. Even today, I've had friends in their early-mid 20s criticize online dating and cell phones. And tomorrow people will pick on their friends for wearable devices.

5254092,comment,5252054,5253287,2,0,noname123,,,"Hi Gnosis,<p>Thanks for your detailed response with details. I'll address about being a nice person, CBT and Maslow's hierarchy of needs.<p>a) On Being Nice<p>My experience of dealing with ""nice begets nice"" have been situations where, a) both parties are equitable in some context and have something to gain from one another (emotional need met in relationships, being on the same sports or business team etc) or b) where someone who's in a higher position of power and doesn't find the less empowered person threatening. This may sound very clinical but often-times, people confuse themselves unconsciously about their capacity to be a altruistic person vs. <i>their need to feel altruistic</i>. Common example include some people's need to feel like a good person in romantic or social context but in the end lead on the more needy lover/friend, some people's need to feel like a ""creative"" person but find themselves resorting to ""capitalist sins"" about their career/promotion in critical times.<p>For me personally, it's more honest and accurate for myself to say that I enjoy the feeling of giving and being loved and it's important to my well-being; but that feeling is subordinate to my self-interest. I feel this is true love rather than confusing my ultimately selfishness, misrepresenting and leading myself and someone else on.<p>b) CBT<p>IMO, most therapy tries to change the way you think or feel about your problems but not how to go about fixing the problems themselves. I don't want to dive into the exact mechanics of CBT/NLP/Psychotherapy/SSRI, but I find them to be more evasive and ultimately ineffective ways to confront emotional issues.<p>I want to be a professional basketball player in the NBA. Correcting negative emotional triggers throughout the day as to why I'm not 6' 5'' is ultimately not going to be effective. I have to apply domain-specific knowledge in basketball for undersized guards such as floaters and dribble-attack moves to compensate for my shortness. Or if I'm past a specific age, it's pretty unrealistic and I should divert my attention/resources to more realistic goals. The same binary logic applies to relationships, career's and yuppie ambitions. Psychology is too vague to solve my domain specific problems such as how to talk to girls, whether to work for a RoR or Python shop or how to start a vegan bakery-shop that would impress my friends. I don't want to suppress my negative thoughts or ""sublime"" them into more positive one's, they are there to force me to either do correct my shortcomings or admit that I suck. And I'd rather concede to my realistic conditions and progress realistically than to delude myself with the magic bullet of positive thinking that will never come.<p>c) Maslow's Pyramid of Needs<p>I believe that self-actualization and self-transcendence is too abstract for me. Helping to start a school or free clinic in Africa to me is a vanity like owning a yacht because I wouldn't do it unless I have more free time or money. I don't see any of my artistic/creative activities like creative writing, composing music etc. as ""higher-lifting"" as much as playing World of Warcraft or programming. They are fun things that I like to do to get into the flow of one particular thing and to assign a higher purpose and say I'm a ""maker/tinkerer"" or ""chronicler of human condition"" is ludicrous and egoistic. In my humble opinion, Einstein, Shakespeare or Tom Brady whoever don't do necessarily write or think differently than I do. They just do it in orders of magnitude better which doesn't put them in a different ""creative class"" of ""free-thinkers"" which somehow one day I hope to associate with, it just means that I suck and will most likely suck for the rest of my life. My problem isn't ""finding myself,"" I did that exercise in kindergarten But it's how to make my life better now.",1361402739

What are you talking, specifics please? Is Java a framework with features comparable to Rails?</i><p>I admit this was sloppy wording, however your article is called 'Rails, You Have Turned into Java.' :) I was comparing Rails 4 (removes lots of features/bloat), with Java Frameworks which do not have a reputation for slimming down... Of course I'm sure there are some minimal Java web frameworks out there too (sorry not familiar with many). Your article is somewhat provocative and not representative of the experience of many with Rails so I wouldn't be surprised if you encounter a defensive reaction to this sort of sentiment. That's to be expected, as was the reaction of those using Java frameworks to DHH's blowhard rhetoric when he started out with Rails.<p><i>Why is the laundry list of technologies absurd, these are the technologies that I run a business on.</i><p>They're absurd as a criticism of Rails because many of them are completely external to Rails, not required to run a website/app, and some of them are not the right choices IMHO. Rails does not require any of these components to run websites even at scale. Sure some of them might be useful, but none are essential or intrinsic to Rails.<p>Forgive me but I think the choice of RefineryCMS was a mistake, and if you back out of that mistake, you'd find Rails a lot more forgiving, a lot lighter, and a lot more suited to what you want to do if you're writing a large webapp with lots of components (or several interacting webapps). Problems with engines, subapps, conflicting routes etc are all based on this, and simply don't occur in most Rails apps. I've used it as a CMS for some clients and regret having done so in retrospect - it's not terrible standalone (also not great) but I can see how integrating it with an app would be a nightmare. You don't need to use meta-frameworks built on Rails to build an app, in fact I'd say it's a mistake, use a few discrete gems like devise, and just build what you want.",1361401987

You waste all of the spindles because the operation rate (requests coming into the channel) vs the amount of data ops needed to satisfy the request, basically leave your disks waiting around the next request to come in from the network. (btw that allows you to make a nearly perfect emission rate scheduler for disk arms but that is another story).<p>What this means is that petabyte pods are going to be nearly useless, although with an external index they can be dense.",1361401552

It seems YC is interested in pushing early seed stage companies to raise a big next round and become a ""large, venture-backed company"" (from our interview rejection earlier this spring).<p>This ""2013 startup"" is something different: focus on customers and revenue instead of just raw users, and go from there. At least that's my interpretation of the concept.",1361401551

It takes a lot of effort to go outside of your comfort zone, but once you do, you gain a huge advantage over more talented people. Because now you feel able to do things they think are out of reach or simply dont think of them at all. It is really being outside a bubble while the other people is inside.<p>Ive been feeling this way for this last year since I begun my project.

The two worst things about the internet are that it's simply more difficult to empathize with other people, and that there are fewer / zero consequences for rudeness.<p>One thing caught my attention:<p>> I have never known my Dad. My mom left him when I was four. They were both drug users and to escape the drug usage my mom left him. I have only blurry memories of him. None of my memories of him are positive.<p>Having had similar experiences, from my perspective this is the root cause of your troubles.

CMU for example is extremely flexible, even with patents.<p>But I'd also recommend looking at the terms of the contract that gave you funding.<p>Government funded projects usually include government purpose rights. It depends on the contract how bad the rights are for a company.<p>In most cases, government funding means that in a pinch, they can take all your tech and give it to another company to mass produce. The reason would probably be some wartime situation where you needed to produce a million X to fight. I think this happened to B52s in WWII.<p>Other recommendations about tech transfer are spot on.<p>You should also take this as an opportunity to network with potential investors. Go to your school's entrepreneurship center (if they have one), and talk to people there about your plans.<p>I know for CMU, you can meet lots of Angels that way. Lots of the associated companies have probably gone through the same process.",1207248921

Can you, please, extend it? What's the main difference between them?<p>Because you say that the primary abstraction of a ""list"" programming language is a tree, which I think not. Since a tree is a directed graph without cycles, you wouldn't have loops. So, at least is a directed graph. But then, which property has the ""hash"" language graph that the ""list"" language graph has not? It's an undirected graph?

The recent renewal of interest in programming languages, as well as publicity by writers like pg, Yegge, Raganwald, etc, have led more people to become interested in Lisp, but it's on an informal, person-by-person basis.  Some of these people (like me) have chosen to stick with it and new Lisp communities have formed by gradual accretion.  But this process has started later and been more distributed than other languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl).<p>In researching things and trying to figure out Lisp setup problems, I've noticed that there are fewer technical ""How do I ..."" questions now than a couple years ago but more usage questions.   The technical problems <i>are</i> being solved and now more stuff ""just works"" - not completely but much more than in the recent past.  I've noticed this for CLisp, SBCL, ASDF, and other tools.  There's more documentation, more tutorials, etc.  Now there are a couple young web frameworks (UCW, Weblocks), generally accepted libraries for common tasks, etc.  Lisp is growing in popularity and is maybe 1-2 years away from being ""tasteable"" - ie you can try it out without a big hassle and a research project.  I think that will be an inflection point, after which growth will come much faster.",1207245803

This won&#x27;t eliminate risk for inexperienced investors, but investment is never without risk, and there&#x27;s nothing that can be done about that.<p>Thing is, I don&#x27;t see equity crowdfunding as a replacement for VC funding because much of the value that comes from established investors comes from their insight, experience and contacts. If ecf becomes popular enough, VC&#x27;s will still be able to invest in and advise great companies, but hopefully a majority of the returns will be more distributed.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that the risk is significantly higher in startups/private ventures, and that a vast majority of the money invested will be lost, but hopefully ecf will allow a large enough number of people to invest a small enough amount in each company (a la kickstarter) that the losses aren&#x27;t catastrophic, but enough aggregate capital is able to be accumulated for companies to do what they need to do.",1446267433

10481845,comment,10480383,10481513,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Have you looked into Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace peer to peer lending platforms?<p>1. Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace have grown up in a period of historically low defaults. We will see how successful investors, retail and institutional, really are at assessing and managing risk when the current cycle ends and defaults rise. As Warren Buffett said, &quot;Only when the tide goes out do you discover who&#x27;s been swimming naked.&quot;<p>2. Marketplace lending activity is increasingly institutional[1]. Without institutional money seeking yield, you would not see nearly as much dollar volume in this market.<p>3. While I would not be surprised to find that some institutional investors aren&#x27;t very diligent, you should also recognize that the notes they are purchasing typically make up just a portion of their investments. Unless you have a 360-view of a fund, it&#x27;s not entirely fair to pass judgment on how well the fund manager is managing risk.<p>4. Assessing the risk of Lending Club and Prosper notes, which are debt obligations associated with consumer loans, is a very different exercise than assessing the risk of an equity investment in a company, especially when that company has little or no operating history.<p>5. The last time I checked, the notes on Lending Club and Prosper were actually obligations of Lending Club and Prosper and are not secured by the actual loans. In other words, if Lending Club or Prosper run into financial difficulty and can&#x27;t meet their obligations, investors can lose even if a borrower is still making payments on his or her loan. I would venture a guess that many of the supposedly diligent retail investors you refer to don&#x27;t actually know this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://qz.com/536573/one-thing-putin-and-kim-jong-un-both-get-right-changing-time-zones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qz.com/536573/one-thing-putin-and-kim-jong-un-both-ge...</a>",1446266819

Every seems to assume that it will always be a single investor investing in a single company. What I think will quickly evolve is syndicates of small investors that pool their money and their intelligence, and will invest in multiple companies. Basically they will do what wealthy investors do to manage their risk. \nWe in the tech industry who also have an interest in finance and investing will play a constructive role by sharing our insights about the viability of these companies.

It&#x27;s just that startups are required to make certain SEC disclosures prior to taking investment from the general public, so that the public can have information about what it&#x27;s actually investing in. There are exemptions for startups that <i>only</i> seek money from institutional and wealthy investors, on the theory that such investors can hire their own attorneys and accountants to do an SEC-like job. So, the theory goes, they don&#x27;t need the SEC vetting the transparency of the offering, because they will pay for a similar vetting process themselves.<p>This changes the rules so retail investors can invest <i>blindly</i> in stocks, i.e. without being first informed about the nature of the investment opportunity through the SEC disclosures. It seems pretty reasonable to me that if someone wants to raise money, they should be required to disclose, to the potential investor, enough information about the financial position of the company and the nature of the investment for the investor to make an informed decision. If you want it leveled between institutional and retail investors, I&#x27;d prefer leveling in the direction of more transparency for both classes of investors, rather than less. If the issue is just that the SEC process is too bureaucratic, then propose a reform to streamline it, rather than bypassing disclosures entirely.<p>One thing that makes it particularly needed is that a possible alternative, dealing with misleading fundraising through after-the-fact lawsuits, is mostly ineffective, since successful suits end up as judgments against bankrupt companies, who won&#x27;t pay them. If a company gets a bunch of investors while not being entirely truthful with them about its financial position/revenues/etc., suing them after it collapses doesn&#x27;t help you at that point. That&#x27;s the situation we had before the SEC was created, and was the motivation for the 1933 Securities Act requiring companies to register an offering and make certain disclosures, prior to selling securities to the public.",1446265517

We have several examples here:  <a href=""http://spacemath.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spacemath.github.io</a>.  These are all for educational purposes.<p>The advantage for students is that they can view the modules directly in a browser (desktop, Chromebook, iPad, etc.), and interact with the modules immediately.   No need to download spreadsheet documents that require compatible spreadsheet software.<p>However, we also see Blabr as a candidate in other science/engineering areas.  For example, these blabs are for phase locked loop design:<p>* <a href=""http://blabr.io/?01bec2bf0256d05f5b2d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blabr.io/?01bec2bf0256d05f5b2d</a>. \n* <a href=""http://blabr.io/?0d6aa64641772d438350"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blabr.io/?0d6aa64641772d438350</a><p>We think that these are viable alternatives to using Excel.

Before that the regular appeals courts heard patent appeals. The idea was that subject matter experts and scientist-judges would be better able to adjudicate complicated patent appeals.<p>What we got from the CAFC was the explosion of software patents, regular messes of abusive patent rules, an overwhelming bias against small companies accused of infringement by monster corps with patent portfolios, legalization of patents based on abstract ideas, and regular rebukes by the Supreme Court that has to try to rein them in with regular 9-0 decisions that the CAFC then finds ways to ignore.<p>The problem is that anyone who could get appointed to such a court is probably personally invested in the power of the patent system. His history is probably in mega corps with thousands of patents to block innovative disruptors. Such a judge&#x27;s future prestige and professional respect is determined by how much he supports omnipotent and unlimited patents with little review of validity.<p>So these judges are inevitably judging their own careers in every case. They are as biased and corrupt as you might expect anyone to be when asked to judge the limits of his own power and influence.<p>No. Cases should not be tried by juries of subject matter experts. That just leads to more corruption. We do need better rules that make it harder to abuse the system, but we&#x27;re better off with ordinary judges and juries making the decisions, even though they sometimes screw it up through ignorance.

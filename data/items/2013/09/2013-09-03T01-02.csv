Mozilla has the most geographically diverse set of interns of any Silicon Valley company I know. In addition to regular recruiting at North American Universities, Mozilla also recruits from the open source Mozilla community, and that means people come from everywhere. I was recruited on-campus but two of my roommates whom I lived with were recruited directly from the community and were from Argentina and India.<p>2. At least on my project (I worked in the Labs group), I got total freedom to scope out a project I wanted to work on, convince my managers about why it could be great, then go ahead and build it. This is a remarkable amount of flexibility for an internship.<p>3. You got to keep the laptop. Because Mozilla&#x27;s open source, we just used the default OS X with no custom stuff. Since the value would go down after the summer, they let us keep it as a perk!<p>4. Once every two years, they fly out everyone in the company and a lot of people in the community to a single place to meet up (Summit).

6318249,comment,6315829,6316608,2,0,btilly,,,"<i>> If you assume that the observer is described by quantum mechanics, then the Everett Interpretation is logically required to be true. If you want to argue for anything else, then you need to explain why you, the observer, are not described by our best scientific theory. That&#x27;s a pretty good reason to take the theory seriously.</i><p><i>Arthur Conan Doyle notwithstanding, in science the truth is not arrived at by eliminating the alternatives. Science requires positive evidence -- absence of contrary evidence doesn&#x27;t support a given outlook. Were this not true, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster would win acceptance through lack of contrary evidence.</i><p>How much science do you actually know?  Because this sounds like philosophical twaddle that sounds good but makes no sense.  If you seek positive proof of everything, then you can never generalize from experience at all.  Every day is logically a new day, every object a new object and you have to rethink all of your assumptions at every step.<p>Science does not do this.  Instead it tries to produce precise and general theories, tries to test them to destruction, and as they fail to be destroyed, assume them more and more broadly (while testing what we can in every detail that we can).<p><i>> ... the Everett Interpretation is logically required to be true.</i><p><i>In science, nothing ever becomes true, but some things become false. Philosopher David Hume summarized this outlook by saying, &quot;No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion.&quot;</i><p>Sorry, but you fail at basic logic.  It is absolutely valid in science to ask, &quot;What is the consequence if this theory applied to that system.&quot;<p>The consequence in quantum mechanics of a simple quantum mechanical experiment interacting with a complex quantum mechanical system is that the complex quantum mechanical system should be thrown into a superposition of quantum mechanical states that cannot meaningfully interact thanks to well-understood thermodynamic principles.<p>Whether this is an accurate description of the world is another question.  However we&#x27;ve had several hundred years of spectacular success from assuming that the world is described by our best scientific theories, and then testing them as best we can - even though it means accepting things we cannot test at the moment.  If we extend that principle to the present moment, we&#x27;re forced to the Everett Interpretation.  And if that turns out to be incorrect in some fundamental level, it is a basic fact that, to the extent that quantum mechanics does describe that system, the Everett Interpretation is true for it.<p><i>On that basis, and assuming we&#x27;re still discussing physics, nothing is &quot;logically required to be true.&quot; That&#x27;s not science, it&#x27;s philosophy.</i><p>You just failed at basic logic.  I made a statement of the form, &quot;If A, then B.&quot;  This is a statement of math, not science, and as such can be true or false.  (It is, in fact, true.)<p>The question of physics is whether the statement that quantum mechanics applies to both observer and observed is true.  Nobody knows the answer to that.  However the path that science has taken for centuries says that we should make that assumption as long as quantum mechanics remains our best theory, and we come up with no evidence against it applying to observers, and then find every way that we can to test it.",1378172714

Eventually, the variance will become intolerable enough (sans regularization) that basic income will appear to be the only solution; even the smartest people will see a personal need for something like it. There will be a lot of struggling and fighting over implementation (e.g. do college graduates get more? how about families? should society incentivize or penalize reproduction?) but everyone will agree that it&#x27;s necessary. That&#x27;s probably about 30-50 years from now.<p>Okay, so what&#x27;s the #1 threat to software developers&#x27; job security? Not robots. We have robots that write code (compilers) and our jobs are still challenging. Instead, it&#x27;s upper-level complacency in society. An elite that would rather hold position and keep relative rank than grow society and gain absolute prosperity (but at a lesser rate than others, losing rank). Historically, this is the norm for elites. Many people, especially in positions of power (because power selects such people) would rather reign in hell than serve in heaven. If they can conspire toward self-protection and social mediocrity, they will. The good news is that, in a large and heterogeneous society, it&#x27;s actually very hard to hold any conspiracy together for very long. This is why conspiracy theories overstate the power of such organizations; conspiracies (lower-case &#x27;c&#x27;) exist all over the place (e.g. Davos assholes) but none have the power to run the world unilaterally. It&#x27;s too chaotic and large. Societies and nations have set themselves back centuries when their elites conspired toward mediocrity, but I don&#x27;t think the world elite is capable of doing so-- especially not now.<p>If the global business elite figures out a way to conspire toward mediocrity, the people like us are fucked, because excellence will cease to matter and being good at what one does will just get one the reputation of a troublemaker. However, the likelihood that anyone could pull this together in a world with unprecedented distribution of technical literacy is incredibly low.<p>As long as there are people looking to do things in this world, and the world continues to advance technologically, there will be a high level of demand for people who are technically competent.

So whether you get the slightly reduced json payload size and use the users cpu to generate html or just get cached html from the server you still end up with the same thing, and arguably, similar response times.<p>I find the answer is not one or the other it&#x27;s both.  If a certain page requires interactivity then embrace Javascript and do the interactivity with Angular or Ember.  You end up writing less Javascript.  If you do it as decorating html using jQuery then you  will end up with more javascript.  Most pages in web apps don&#x27;t require this much interactivity on every page though.  There may be a few pages here and there.  Most of it is just document viewing. In that case just send down cached html.  Sure Bustle.com is fast, but so is Basecamp, both take entirely different approaches to display pages.<p>When I first got into Knockout a few years ago, I was a kid in a candy store.  I wanted to do everything with Javascript and Knockout.  Soon I grew up and realized you just don&#x27;t need all that crap to display an f&#x27;in table.  It&#x27;s just a table for God&#x27;s sake.  We have been displaying tables since the dawn of web browser.  In fact you will pay client CPU cost trying to display a table in Angular when you could just send it over in HTML.<p>Now if that table requires heavy editing(not filtering, or sorting, that stuff is easy as decoration), then sure bring in Angular.<p>On the other hand if I need drag and drop, validation, on complex forms, I&#x27;ll definitely bring in Angular.<p>Choose the right tool.",1378171625

Do some foreign-born founders struggle with their accents? Yes. Is a strong accent a barrier to communication? Quite likely, yes. Is it worth it for a founder to do what it takes to communicate her message exactly, and nothing else? Absolutely.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t the goal be to either: 1) become excellent communicators, or to 2) find excellent communicators, and get them on &quot;our&quot; team?<p>Now we can focus on, with our characteristic laser-like ability, and talk about why accents may hold somebody back, as a community, and how we can help people succeed anyway.<p>Some ideas:
- Schools to help founders communicate better?
- An additional service within accelerator programs to help founders with strong accents become effective anyway? (Maybe YC could just take this and run with it)<p>Solve that problem and move on to the next one. Isn&#x27;t that The Rule?<p>Let me take the opportunity to focus on what, imho,  started this whole controversy. While I consider pg&#x27;s position to be valid, he should probably have explained it better, through his usual channel of the essay form, before talking about it in the media, where his words were much more likely to be taken out of context. He didn&#x27;t, they were, and we&#x27;re left picking up the media-transformed pieces of what would have been an otherwise instructive take on what might hold some foreign-born startup founders back. pg seems to have forgotten why he writes essays (explore ideas as fully as possible, while leaving room for improvement), and now he has to pay for that mistake with a (possibly -- I have no way of knowing if he&#x27;d prepared an article about this) quickly written piece of damage control, published in the middle of a frenzy of accusations and hurt feelings. The &quot;Founders&#x27; Accents&quot; essay is weaker than it would have been if he&#x27;d written it before he did the inc.com interview, as the interviewer would have had a more self-contained source to reference, counter-arguments and all.[0]<p>I must conclude, therefore, that his comment may have done more harm, in the short-term, than good. It remains to be seen whether we can turn this around for the good of all.<p>We should remember, though, that we&#x27;re in this together, and pg is not the only one who has a responsibility to make sure the people that matter don&#x27;t miss out on opportunities because of something that can be fixed. Which is not to say that its trivial. Fifteen years is a long time.<p>[0] For one, I don&#x27;t think the discussion surrounding it would have devolved into accusations of racism, though that probably says more about my view of people than about pg&#x27;s detractors in this case.",1378171186

A housekeeper can be replaced by modifying the nature of the house - a fridge that keeps itself stocked and roombas that actually do a proper job, for example.<p>My point is that the qualitative difference between a creative and non-creative job is mitigated to some extent by all the &#x27;non-creative&#x27; stuff we have to do every day. So even knowledge workers are not immune to &#x27;dumb&#x27; automation. An example of this would be remote work and off-shoring, which has opened up software development projects to global competition.<p>However, the argument still stands - knowledge workers aren&#x27;t unionized manual labour and if robots are going to replace everything, someone has to program the robots. And, there&#x27;s easily going to be more &#x27;robots&#x27; tomorrow than today for some time to come. So what could end the &#x27;world automation&#x27; gravy train we are on right now?<p>IMHO, the average knowledge worker has a much clearer and more present danger that the chance they might be making themselves redundant - and one that would affect pretty much everyone, not just knowledge workers.

While I definitely applaud osx86 builds, I don&#x27;t really find this build comparable to a Mac Pro of any recent generation. I think a much better comparison build would have been to upgrade an older Mac Pro 3.1 or 4.1 (EFI64 being the key) to 12 core with maximum ram and video card upgrades. I think right now the 4.1 is the sweet spot (considering memory prices). But even if someone maxed out the build, I don&#x27;t think it would come close to the new 2013 Mac Pro. Another thing to think about here, especially for developers, is the software aspect of hacked/upgraded osx builds. When Apple releases a new OS version, or a new Xcode version, it might not work or it might be buggy / unstable. This is what happened with my old Mac Pro 1.1 and OSX 10.8 (flashed to 2.1 and upgraded 8 core 3.0ghz w/ 32gb). I was able to get up to 10.7 but 10.8 is messed up and the new 10.9 look like a no go.

At the time the modern &#x27;link rel=&quot;icon&quot;&#x27; approach was definitely not in common use so it&#x27;s no wonder nobody at MS chose it, and people probably would have complained loudly about MS introducing &#x27;some proprietary icon HTML&#x27;.<p>Another reason ICO is good as a favicon format is that it makes it impossible for site authors to accidentally use a 500KB image file as their icon (which you could trivially do with png, gif, jpg, etc.) - ICO is intentionally a file format for small images, tailor-made for what icons were like in that era. So by relying on ICO they ensured that the favicon.ico on each site would be small, cheap to download, easy to cache, and easy to author.",1378170252

I suspect that the single and only reason it isn&#x27;t dim gray is the appeal-to-sympathy &quot;you downvote the truth!&quot; noise that manipulates the weak-willed.<p>Just to be clear, Google has always had closed source, proprietary Google bits (gmail, maps, etc. Originally they even built these as a big binary blob in the platform image, and it was &quot;fixing fragmentation&quot; when they moved them to separate apps), and the open source Android bits. Everything you heard about Android 4.3 is in the open source bits (&quot;years old core of basic functions&quot; -- what obnoxious, noisy prattle).",1378170217

6318122,comment,6318121,6318121,1,0,strikeanerve,,,"Content
If you want to describe a feeling of comfort and satisfaction, by all means say you are content, but using the word as a noun to describe written and other works of authorship adopts an attitude you might rather avoid. It regards these works as a commodity whose purpose is to fill a box and make money. In effect, it disparages the works themselves.<p>Those who use this term are often the publishers that push for increased copyright power in the name of the authors (creators, as they say) of the works. The term content reveals their real attitude towards these works and their authors. (See Courtney Love&#x27;s open letter to Steve Case and search for content provider in that page. Alas, Ms. Love is unaware that the term intellectual property is also biased and confusing.)<p>However, as long as other people use the term content provider, political dissidents can well call themselves malcontent providers.<p>The term content management takes the prize for vacuity. Content means some sort of information, and management in this context means doing something with it. So a content management system is a system for doing something to some sort of information. Nearly all programs fit that description.<p>In most cases, that term really refers to a system for updating pages on a web site. For that, we recommend the term web site revision system (WRS).",1378170177

Seniors are 500-1000. Usually the customer actually gets a quote for 1 senior : 2 junior, i.e. say 450 a day.<p>* Most people here work normal hours most of the time, although some people and projects do work a more. The project I&#x27;ve been on the past 6 months has a lot of crunch time, so I feel like &#x27;people here work long hours&#x27;, but actually &#x27;my team work long hours&#x27;. And yes, not paying overtime on a project that needs it is a bit yuck.<p>Regarding pay, the sense I get is that outside finance, new programmers get 25-30k depending on quality, and after about 5 years, get 30-40k. These are actually very comfortable salaries, depending on where you live. Pay at this place is strangely poor, given that I think the people I work with are actually quite good.<p>I posted that because I read on HN, or around the net, a lot of people saying things like &#x27;6 figure salaries&#x27;, or &#x27;I quite my job as a finance quant because programming pays better&#x27;. Not round here it don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m fine with that. I&#x27;m glad I get to spend my days playing a beautifully convoluted puzzle game, or imagining things and then making them happen.

8837371,comment,8836271,8836271,0,0,bbcbasic,,,"I am assuming you want to invest with minimal additional effort. E.g. more like buying shares than flying over to the states to enrol in YC.<p>In that case you could pick up some books on investing in shares. This has good liquidity and although risky it is unlikely you will lose 100%. If you have a portfolio of shares in different sectors, you should be at low risk of losing lots.<p>If you fancy learning but still a passive investment, then maybe stamps, antiques, collectibles. You will get additional enjoyment out of it in the meantime.<p>Some parts of the UK I imagine you could use 5k for a house down-payment and rent it out. I have been expat for 4 years so I have no idea.<p>If you want to be more involved you could start some kind of business, using 50-100 pounds and your own effort to get it going, then &#x27;invest&#x27; more money once you have a proven method. For example once you can spend 100 on advertising to make 200 gross profit, then you can scale that up using the 5000, then keep reinvesting to grow it. Easier said than done!<p>Or you could renovate something. Lots of people have broken things they would give away or sell cheaply - you repair and sell on for a profit. But you will need some capital and that is how you can invest your 5000.",1420433913

Who said Paleo is scientific? A diet along those lines, for me, reduces mood swings, hunger, and the combination (hangriness), while being tasty and improving the list of numbers they measure at the doctor&#x27;s office. We do all have to live with our n=1, after all. Eat what&#x27;s truly tasty and makes your life good!<p>Somewhere there is a flame war about what the Paleolithic humans ate, and whether that was what we are nicknaming &quot;paleo&quot; now. We shouldn&#x27;t take the names too seriously, though, or we&#x27;ll be confused about what the South Beach diet is (big macs?), the Beyonce diet (...?), etc. Low-fat and low-cholesterol diets have accurately descriptive names. Not catchy. Also once seemingly backed by science, which was incomplete enough to be wrong or influenced heavily by agricultural lobbyists.<p>An discussion about whether &quot;reducing inflammation&quot; as discussed on the internet is scientific would be interesting.

The complexity of the USB protocol enables certain kinds of attacks that aren&#x27;t possible through a floppy interface.<p>2.

8837358,comment,8836085,8836085,0,0,Jtsummers,,,"> After that, beyond basic bar soap, you’re on your own. You have to order supplies through the commissary system, a sort of monopoly drugstore run by the Keefe Group out of Missouri. This is where you purchase everything from hygiene supplies and chips to a Styrofoam cup. You place orders once a week, and the following week a delivery guy shows up with a cart piled high with plastic bags of stuff. If nobody on the outside puts money on your “books” (inmate account), you can order a second indigent kit. But as soon as someone sends you money, Keefe deducts that cost. And with a 20-cent pack of ramen costing $1.18, just like most monopolies throughout history, goods are sold at an inflated rate.<p>This is one of the parts of prisons I find particularly distressing. I&#x27;m trying to find (but can&#x27;t recall the name of the company) an article, perhaps posted here a few months ago, about a company that handles inmate &quot;bank accounts&quot;. The percentage they took was absurd. Between what the financial company took and the prisons, $100 sent to a prisoner might end up only being $50 by the time they could spend it. Paired with the high prices in the commissary they can barely afford &quot;essentials&quot;.<p>EDIT:\nJPay.

It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but most things worked perfectly. Performance was excellent. System stability was high, too.<p>The problem with Lion is that it started dicking around with previously <i>stable user expectations</i> -- a perfect example being the skeu Address Book that had inferior usability.<p>Mountain Lion improved things a bit.<p>Mavericks improved things further, and represents another high point in OS X history.<p>Yosemite once again dicks around with previously <i>stable user expectations</i> -- a perfect example being the new aesthetic which looks crisp in retina but looks fussy and unfinished in low resolution.

8837353,comment,8836734,8836980,0,0,jsz0,,,"> Guess you havn&#x27;t had a hanging Safari or Chrome tab take down the entire OS.<p>According to the contents of my ~/Library/Application Support/CrashReporter logs my last Safari crash was August 3rd 2014 which IIRC would have been a 10.10 DP release. I don&#x27;t doubt you are having this problem but it&#x27;s hard for me to relate considering my freshest CrashReporter log for any app is VLC from November 3rd 2014. In my experience using 10.10 on 3 different Macs (Mac Pro 4,1, MacMini late 2012, rMBP early 2013) the worst issue I&#x27;ve encountered is somehow when using multiple displays and setting SilverLight video to fullscreen my Dock occasionally gets set to auto-hide. Pretty sure that&#x27;s some ugly hack being done by the SilverLight plugin since it has never happened with Flash or HTML5 full screen video.<p>My gut feeling is these different experiences might be due to migrating data between OSX releases. I had migrated/upgraded from 10.4 to 10.8 and finally did a fresh install / setup for Mavericks which was then upgraded/migrated to 10.10 DPs. Looking at an older backup from November I see some files ~/Library/Application Support/ renamed as <i>.incompatible.</i> so I wonder if perhaps the 10.10 DPs were doing something unique to dump old app data? It just seems odd to me that some of us are having little to no issues while others are reporting these major issues. It could of course also be machine specific (driver) causes but at least for the last 2-3 generations of machines there isn&#x27;t really enough variation in hardware to justify that theory.",1420433588

8837338,comment,8836734,8837242,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"tldr: anecdata supporting &quot;Windows is still worse&quot;<p>I switched to the Windows ecosystem from the mac ecosystem in 2012 because two things happened: I kept hearing that windows had gotten better, and I finally grew up enough to admit that none of the windows complaints I made as a mac fanboy were actually based on experience. Windows did nothing but disappoint and embarrass for a year and a half before I finally gave up and moved back to mac. I&#x27;ve got a list of &quot;small&quot; complaints the length of my arm and a large list of big complaints that were &quot;my fault&quot; in the weak sense that with foreknowledge I could have avoided them. I won&#x27;t post those. Here are the big complaints that happened after I adopted a &quot;don&#x27;t do anything my mother wouldn&#x27;t do&quot; policy in an attempt to improve stability:<p>* An update broke the dynamic linker or something: every time I would try to launch a .exe I would get a segfault in ntdll. Needless to say, rollback didn&#x27;t fix the problem, all checksums appeared fine, and I had to reinstall.<p>* During the Win 7 generation, the shut-down process broke. All process would appear to exit, but the computer would then spin up its fans and never actually shut off. Every time I restarted the computer would want to spend the better part of a day on fsck. Naturally I habitually canceled it; day-long reboot times aren&#x27;t acceptable. Eventually this led to blue-screens on reboot. Reinstall!<p>* After months of normal functionality, Windows 8 decided to forget my serial number. Upon entering the number again, it refused to re-activate. After 5 hours on the phone running remote diagnostics, they had me reinstall the OS.<p>* Most recently, sound and/or keyboard would stop working on wake from sleep. I installed fresh drivers from the laptop vendor (they mentioned a similar problem in the release notes) and it didn&#x27;t work. I uninstalled those and installed fresh drivers from the sound card manufacturer; those didn&#x27;t work either. What kind of a laptop is a laptop without sleep?<p>* The battery life got down to 20 minutes on a year old laptop. That was the last straw.<p>I&#x27;ve been told that this isn&#x27;t normal, but I&#x27;ve caught the same people who told me that I simply purchased from the wrong manufacturer living with huge wake-from-sleep bugs  so I don&#x27;t know what to think. I&#x27;m sure that there exists hardware on which Windows is as stable or more stable than Mac OS is on my mac, but I don&#x27;t know how to reliably find it.",1420433292

It&#x27;s easy : execute finally&#x27;s (&quot;defers&quot;), execute retry policy (go, incidentally, makes generic retry policies very fucking hard due to lack of generics. It is impossible to write a method &quot;TryThreeTimes(method, timeout, params)&quot; in Go.<p>2) It is extremely disappointing that after all the effort that Go forces on you for error handling there are still a dozen classes of errors (of the kind you find often) that can kill your program, even with error handling perfectly up to the Golang author&#x27;s standards.<p>3) These errors happen often enough that it&#x27;s not reasonable to kill the program if they happen, so you absolutely need to recover in daemons and the like. So any reasonably large Go program has to consider exception handling, recovery, and alternate method returns.<p>4) You also have the C++ problem : libraries should never, ever raise an exception (&quot;panic&quot;). But of course, they do (ok granted, the Go standard library is reasonably good about this, but the same cannot be said for github stuff)<p>5) Nobody actually does the error handling. You never see anything other than &quot;return err&quot; or &quot;exit program with log message&quot; in error branches anyway)<p>> I really think (and it looks like we strongly disagree on this point) it&#x27;s one of Go&#x27;s virtues to really distinguish between what&#x27;s part of the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve<p>Yeah we disagree here. I feel Go&#x27;s error handling standard prevents me from focusing on the problem independently of what might go wrong, and this limits my abstract thinking. What makes this even more frustrating is that this is exactly the same problem C had.<p>> This is clearly not the way I work but that&#x27;s a serious fault from developers if they do.<p>With the guarantee of quality developers, I&#x27;d develop nearly anything in C++. There is no problem in C++ if you have a really good team and there&#x27;s just no beating the C++ language in too many departments (portability, abstraction, compiler quality, tooling, power, control of complexity in huge programs ...).<p>But the great failing of C++ is simple : it doesn&#x27;t support junior programmers, or otherwise somewhat incompetent teams very well at all.<p>The question here is : does Go ? I don&#x27;t know, but to me it&#x27;s not looking good. I would argue that the damage that can be done by slightly incompetent programmers in Go far exceeds the damage that can be done in most other languages (ok, granted, maybe it&#x27;s better than C++, but definitely worse than Java).",1420432965

If you turn it very slowly you can do so without breaking any noodles, but it takes a long time to get to a new orientation.<p>My assertion is that OS X (and Windows for that matter) are trying to serve two masters, one is the &#x27;appliance user&#x27; who never puts anything on their device except for what came out of the App store, and the &#x27;computer user&#x27; who uses their machine as a tool to develop software for themselves, or appliance users. While not a mainstream idea, I think a Macbook with IOS would be a better &quot;answer&quot; for application users than a Macbook with OSX, and a Macbook with OSX and none of the appliancey features might be a better Macbook for developers. Developers would no doubt run IOS in a VM on their Macbook which would both provide them a test platform when delivering new code, and a place to use their own appliancy type apps, away from the core development world. Windows could do that as well, splitting into an &#x27;end user&#x27; and a &#x27;developer&#x27; mode.<p>That said, it is really frustrating all around.",1420432884

I also have a brother who has withdrawn from the world completely and I would consider that he is highly crippled from depression.<p>My realisation that this problem is linked to inflammation occured a few years ago. My depression was at it&#x27;s worst and I was barely functioning. I am still not who I was but I&#x27;m doing ok.<p>While I was at my worst, I considered that perhaps my diet contributed to my poor health.<p>Through careful testing I discovered that foods with gluten or casein protein caused me to feel awful. After removing these foods 100% from my diet, there was an improvement but certainly not a full recovery.<p>I&#x27;ve always had bad seasonal allergies but I had never considered that my whole body was inflamed. Strangely, by chance, I found that fexofenadine (an antihistamine) would lift my depression temporarily after taking it for a week. If I continued taking it, then slowly the depression came back. My best explanation is that the signaling process of inflammation dampens the ability for my brain to think clearly. Since discovering this, I found other things that helped:<p>I quit caffeine 100% as it seemed to also have a negative effect for me (when for years it lifted my depression, now it&#x27;s clear I am best to do without).<p>I no longer drink alcohol.<p>I&#x27;ve worked hard to remove sugar and processed foods.<p>I&#x27;ve found that daily running will help lift my depression greatly.<p>Another helpful item I found was licorice tea which I use sparingly. This had powerful anti-inflammatory properties which I have found useful.<p>For years I had very bad sleep habits. I&#x27;ve corrected these and always sleep to a schedule now. Even so, I still rarely wake up feeling rested.<p>I feel much better than I used to and can get by but still do not feel quite right.

Mapping that onto market segments lets you further narrow this down to just work on the things that are important to the people who buy your product, when most visitors to your site are random click-through traffic that will never buy anything, and feeds back useful information to your product design process.<p>The degree of focus that this permits is how startups and small companies can find and target their market quickly, where a large company could just market to everybody and see who responds. It&#x27;s hard to tell how much of the tech startup boom has been driven by this, but after working for and with a few of them, third party analytics is critical because you usually don&#x27;t have the time or money to find your market without it.

A beautiful example is<p>> The silicon sultans are some of the few businesspeople who can compete with the robber barons in terms of ownership. Today most firms are widely held by large numbers of shareholders: the largest individual shareholder in Exxon, is Rex Tillerson, the company’s chief executive. He owns 0.05% of the stock. Together Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Eric Schmidt control two-thirds of the voting stock in Google. Mark Zuckerberg owns 20% of Facebook shares but almost all of its “class B” shares, which have ten times the voting power of ordinary shares.<p>So it makes a point about ownership, then compares Exxon&#x27;s CEO&#x27;s low _ownership_ with Facebook and Google founders&#x27; high _voting rights_. Not the same thing. For comparison, Schmidt has 2% of Google at the moment. And let&#x27;s not forget Standard Oil started in 1870. How much stock shall we expect Google&#x27;s CEO in 120 years to have?<p>> Today Google and Apple between them provide 90% of smartphone operating systems<p>These are two large companies competing heavily, investing billions of dollars for something that they give away free (Google esp, though apple makes its money on hardware so I would claim it doesnt charge for the OS).<p>To say that this is an &quot;unparalleled concentration of power&quot; is ridiculous.

If you&#x27;re using separate preamps and amps, then yes, turning down the volume on the preamp isn&#x27;t going to matter. With almost all headphone setups, you are doing all volume control on the amp though, and none on the dac - it&#x27;s pretty rare for there to be a dedicated preamp in the chain when dealing with computer -> headphones.<p>>Turning down the volume will do nothing<p>Again, specifically referring to the Schiit gear here, with the volume control details being specifically from them.

Again, there is no reason not to install shut-off relays.<p>Plenty of the best gear out there will include power up sequence instructions - Amps being last on, first off, is something that has been pretty standard for decades.

I certainly looked through the Gradle codebase when its version 2.0 came out and there was hardly a line of Groovy code in there, only Java. It, too, only uses Groovy for user scripting. If I&#x27;m right about the Grails codebase, static-typed Groovy isn&#x27;t actually used to build any systems of note. Perhaps Cedric Champeau, who wrote the static-typed Groovy codebase, will use it to build the Groovy for Android he&#x27;s presently working on. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether he uses it or uses Java because it&#x27;ll show whether he has enough faith in what he built to actually use it to build something with it. Until static-typed Groovy is used to build something, Groovy will remain a dynamically-typed scripting language for testing, Gradle builds, webpages, etc.",1420430406

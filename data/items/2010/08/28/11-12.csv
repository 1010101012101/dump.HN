Are you really advocating that? (And if so, which part?)<p>I agree with you about the echo chamber.  But it's virtually impossible to live inside an echo chamber when you follow people who share mostly information that is not widely held. By definition, that means those people aren't merely echoing the crowd, and this will take you away from people with me-too tweets about iPhone antenna issues (or whatever the news of the hour is).",1282996376

Eventually Apple decided to make Webkit open source (Webcore was already open source since KHTML was).<p>On the other hand you are very much correct on multitouch, and I would also mention Lala, and their ads company.

I started hanging around in IRC where the core developers chatted about decisions and problems.<p>4. I read the source code and when I wasn't sure why some code was like it was, I asked in the channel. Either someone of the team explained why it's that way, or committed my minor suggestion.<p>5. That way I learned more and more about the language and the project. My suggestions became better. I <i>loved</i> to see my suggestions being picked up and used in the wild.<p>6. Eventually I got commit rights (though that wasn't important to me)<p>My advice is to just go for it. Join the IRC room, talk with the people. Help with bugs or documentation.

You mostly only find out about stuff you already have an interest in and rarely stray from your comfort zone. Even coming to HN already limits your horizon to certain types of narratives and _also_ guarantees a limited response to those narratives because certain ways of responding to events are down-modded.<p>Added to the above effect is the pervasive misplaced hero worship and tech fanboyism that is formed based purely on peer pressure and not on merit.<p>IMHO , IANAL , posted in good faith , blah blah blah :)",1282993807

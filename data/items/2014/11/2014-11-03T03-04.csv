Cost reduction could also be a part of it. Every other laptop on the market now looks like a Macbook clone.<p>What they&#x27;re forgetting is that many of the people who buy Thinkpads actually <i>like</i> the old-school, &quot;serious business&quot; look-and-feel that originated with IBM. They could continue making a model that is almost exactly identical to the X60/X61 (an &quot;X62&quot;?) but with a faster CPU, more RAM, and higher-res display, and I&#x27;d bet they&#x27;d still have many customers.",1414987169

Recently I decided to relearn Ocaml with the Real World Ocaml[1] book and, in retrospect, one of my favorite things about the book is their recommendations on tooling[2]. The improved REPL and the vim plugin they recommend are the sort of thing that make learning the language and its libraries much more pleasant but are also the sort of thing I wouldn&#x27;t think of installing on my own if all you told me to install was the compiler (which kind of explains why I never went very far in my previous attempt at learning the language).<p>[1] <a href=""http://realworldocaml.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://realworldocaml.org/</a>

It losses it&#x27;s correlation with the things that we actually want out of an economy. Plus, those in power (rightfully) use the power to get more power of the sort they already have. According the history books I read as a kid, this is what caused capitalism in the first place (english barons with more money than power using that money to make more money) and the (serial) French revolutions (aristocrats with more power than money using that power to gain more power).<p>I note these bits in particular:<p>&quot;After a financial and banking crisis, the first order of business is to clean up the banks, and to do it quickly and radically. Institutions that are not viable need to be shut down while the others should be provided with capital.&quot;<p>&quot;Their central thesis was that the key to [Western] success was not climate or religion, but the development of social institutions that included as many citizens as possible...&quot;<p>I&#x27;m also reminded of a good article on what Iceland did after the collapse - I&#x27;m having trouble finding the article, but part of it was that, instead of taking on the debt from their collapsed banks, they issued arrest warrants so Interpol could chase down the executives. (The initial government was going to acquiesce and take on the debt, and that&#x27;s when the &quot;revolution&quot; happened.)<p>Finally, someone gave me a really good quote a couple months ago: &quot;Death is the way for an older organism to gift it&#x27;s energy to a younger one.&quot; I then note that part of the financial problem is that failing institutions are not actually allowed to die - thus keeping that energy stagnating in the aptly-named &quot;zombie&quot; corporations.",1414985447

At least this fact got amended into the paragraph.<p>The bigger picture is that the eastern part of Germany got deindustrialized twice. The first time post-WW2 from both sides. In part by the US-forces who had seized the western parts, like Thuringia, but had to hand them over to the Soviets in time, so they seized anything they could easily move out to the western zones; <i>We take the brain</i>[1].<p>On the other hand the Soviets, who were way more strict in getting their reparations than their western counterparts, took apart a lot of factories and railways and shipped them eastwards. 
Every bigger company that could, moved their HQ and center of operations to the western zones — where they stay until today — on their own as well. With them went up to 3000 mostly well educated people per day, in total more than 3 million (of 17M total) in the 16 years before the wall was built in &#x27;61. The motivation of building the wall was therefore economic in nature, since the GDR couldn&#x27;t survive this ongoing brain drain with the mythical <i>Wirtschaftwunder</i> going on next door.<p>30 years later in the early 1990s after the fall of the Wall and the reunification the <i>Treuhand</i>, a state owned-holding, who&#x27;s sole purpose it was to sell-off the former GDR state owned businesses to potential investors, kind of more or less knowingly finished off the rest of what was left of the industry.
Since not a few of the western investors were solely interested in buying up potential rival enterprises, so they could dismantle them shortly after. This left the east in a highly disadvantageous position with the west of Germany, since there were practically zero industry clusters left and since then state subsidies had could only do so much in creating the organic growth that was needed.[2 includes some good maps]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pentaconsix.com/01gerhis.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pentaconsix.com/01gerhis.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dw.de/mapping-differences-in-two-german-economies/a-17734799"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dw.de/mapping-differences-in-two-german-economies...</a>",1414983890

Now, I want to run a bunch of virtual machines on my server, with a virtual network or two between them ... and already, I have to use ugly hacks to get by instead of just assigning addresses using the standard way of doing things with IPv6. In the best case, I just have to ask for more address space, but even that is completely pointless overhead that only works as an incentive to use fragile network constructs instead of just assigning addresses where they are needed.<p>People seem to have internalized that addresses are scarce and therefore precious and therefore have to be conserved at all cost - they don&#x27;t even notice that that was the problem of IPv4 (or at least the most important problem of IPv4) that IPv6 was supposed to solve, and which it indeed does solve very well, and that their efforts at conserving IPv6 address space cause more harm than they help.<p>Lots of hosters around here are RIPE members who have their standard /32 allocation (which they could extend to /29 without any further documentation required), so if they chose to assign /56 networks to customers, they would have space for about 16 million customers before they would need to request more address space from RIPE, and for 128 million before they need to justify any further need. But apparently they consider it better use of that address space to just leave it mostly unused and make it difficult for their customers to use IPv6, not even noticing that there is a reason why RIPE assigned them a /32 ...",1414983840

In each such human niche, their traditional microbes can probably survive in that niche.  Also, those same microbes will have been surviving for so long that second order optimizations (like ethnic genetic adaptation to the potentially harmful parts of their traditional microbiome package) have likely occurred.  In the face of such &#x27;bio-traditions&#x27;, and their presumptively functional state, we should tread carefully, and study everything before we muck about too much.&quot;<p>This seems to me like an excellent argument for why people who grew up on family farms, or in jungles, or other vaguely historical places should not muck about too much with their microbiomes.  Heck, even third generation New Yorkers are probably solid.<p>However, it seems to miss the point that urbanization, immigration, antibiotic use, and radically weird diets (to name a few factors) are happening all over the modern world.<p>Given the modern situation, having already been disrupted by biologically unprecedented events for centuries, it seems plausible that at least some of us are like sailors at sea, with the metaphorical equivalent of scurvy-before-its-etiology-was-determined.<p>Just as, <i>if you have scurvy</i>, it doesn&#x27;t cost much to try eating citrus and see if it helps, it seems that for people who are already unhappy with their gut health, it probably doesn&#x27;t cost much to experiment here.<p>If you can already see that your digestion/mood/hunger is funky by comparing it do to friends and family, and you can read the research on that suggests these processes can be affected by microbiomes, it seems plausible to me that checking out uBiome or General Biotics or one of the &quot;dating websites for poop&quot; (or whatever, I&#x27;m sure there are more of these things floating around) it doesn&#x27;t seem <i>that</i> crazy to me.  A bit crazy, yes.  But way less crazy than the same experimentation would be for someone who is eating and living in the same manner as their mother&#x27;s mother, and has no more tummy troubles than any of their grandparents.<p>I&#x27;ve published a little in this area, and I didn&#x27;t know about the conquistador story, so the article was appreciated, but I&#x27;m also personally a fan of experimentation that is early, fast, and cheap and I didn&#x27;t see any of the experimental cost benefit analysis that could have been there, and could have made the article better.",1414983677

5594782,comment,5594638,5594638,1,0,mattacular,,,"I think most people understand what the business-side of a business does and what purpose it exists for and why those things are important.<p>What most people don't understand is why the business-side, and especially at the executive level, deserves to be paid so much higher (sometimes exponentially more) than the technical side where the product/brand value is usually being directly or indirectly created? Especially in a tech-oriented business, which more and more U.S. businesses are now-a-days. An article explaining how these effects come into fruition (whether it is that business-people tend to be equipped with better negotiation skills, are better at selling their own skillsets in an interview setting, etc.) might be better received.<p>edit: though this will quickly lead to a discussion on the merits of (late) capitalism as a whole because these problems extend well past the tech world. It's just that now that our economy is decidedly service-based, technical products (or products that at least depend on technology and therefore technologists) are beginning to dominate the landscape but the unbalanced pay for workers/programmers vs. managers/upper-echelon is more pronounced than ever.",1366721999

Within the next year we'll see very significant tests of core components of the system and flight profile (for the first stage at least).<p>The very next Falcon 9 flight (out of Vandenberg) will use the performance overhead provided by the v1.1 upgrade to do a controlled reentry of the 1st stage and then after it has reached terminal velocity it will slow down to a hover out over some remote part of the ocean, then splash down. This is a good and cheap test of a huge part of the flight profile. Meanwhile, the Grasshopper 2 will be more of a full-up Falcon 9 (v1.1) first stage, with 9 engines and will include retractable landing gear. Instead of testing controlled hovering and precision landing it'll go up to supersonic speeds and potentially up to 90km altitude. Essentially testing the return to launch site flight profile in a more realistic setting with more realistic hardware.<p>And then if that proves fruitful they will essentially just stick that hardware into the Falcon 9 stack and do a full up orbital launch with a flyback 1st stage. Possibly within the next few years even. If that works it'll be rather amazing, since much of the cost of a launch is in the manufacture of those 9 engines on that first stage. Even if a reusable stage costs 3x as much as a regular stage and halves the payload capacity if they can get just 6 flights out of each one it'll break even, and if the numbers are more favorable they'll drop the floor out of the orbital launch market and then own it, to the tune of tens of billions of dollars a year in revenue (a feat they are already on their way to doing with their current lineup of rockets).

They often don't work for good reason - but unless you're a C++ expert you don't know that reason.<p>For example suppose that I have a class that has reference members.  Those are fields specified with & - they are kind of like a pointer except that you can't change them, and you use . instead of ->.  Because you can't change them, operator= is not generated for you.  I didn't notice this until I tried to use one in an std::map< ... > and everything blew up.<p>However luckily confusing backtrace message plus google usually leads to a useful stack overflow answer, else I'd find this process much more painful.<p>My one remaining frustration is that I hate how the STL did iterators.  In the STL, if you have a data_type< foo > template, you iterate over it with a data_type< foo >::iterator.  So you get a std::vector< foo >::iterator, a std::set< foo >::iterator, a std::dequeue< foo >::iterator, etc.<p>This is great for the compiler, but as a programmer it is backwards.  I don't care what kind of data structure this came from, I care what kind of data type I get out.  I'd like to see those three examples produce an iterator< foo >.  And then you can dream up things like the ability to take an iterator< foo > and a method on foo that will return a bar, to get an iterator< bar >.  I am used to having map/grep/etc, and it would be nice to be able to translate list-oriented thinking into C++ with less verbose boilerplate.",1366719711

For me it's just part of my vernacular, and to varying levels that's true of all my colleagues and most of my friends. I don't stop to plan when swearing would best fit or use it tactically, it just comes out in sentences. When I'm hungry there's a good chance I'm actually ""fucking starving"", and if I'm referencing someone who can be a bit annoying there's a good chance he's ""a bit of a cunt"".<p>However I do have an automatic filter to tone down or remove swearing based on who I'm talking to. Around a new person, especially work-related, I'll cut it out completely until I have the feeling they're comfortable with it. In particular around clients, there are some who I know well enough to swear at my normal levels around, others I know well but still keep swearing away. I guess sometimes I think about this stuff but for the most part it's just my subconscious knowing when not to swear. Interestingly I very rarely swear when talking to my parents, despite the fact that my mum reels through ""fuck bugger damn shit"" when something goes wrong (so not regularly but maybe once every few days) and my dad swears... a lot.<p>When someone swears a lot it just removes the strength of that swearing. When I call someone a cunt or someone calls me a cunt we judge their meaning not on the word but the tone of voice, most of the time it's not at all offensive - but obviously I wouldn't just hop onto HN and type ""you're a cunt"" to somebody as contextually it's completely different.",1366719114

Different people have different standards so you need to get to know them.

But if you man a phone, or are out in public, swearing is a total no no. But, I suppose even then, there are loads of exceptions. In the work place I see it as a personal 1-2-1 negotiation over time. Or to put it another way, we individually learn when, where and who to swear in front of.<p>To be honest though, I wonder if you are at more risk by offering opinion in the work place.

To at least one sig fig this is correct.  Also it takes about 3 times the chemical gasoline energy to generate electricity because IC engines are not terribly efficient.  We'll call it 10 KW gas equivalent to drive on the interstate at a constant-ish high speed.<p>Now what fraction of the time of a road trip do you spend pumping gas vs driving?  Well it can't take more than 4 minutes to fill a 10 or so gallon gas tank, and on cross country trips I can get a good 8 hours or so outta one tank, so to one sig fig I spend WAY less than 1/100th the time pumping gas vs driving.<p>So multiply 10 KW by 100 times the flow rate (conservation of energy and all that)<p>Another way to look at it, is think of the flow rate, lets say 5 gallons per minute.

Sure there could be reasons not to try and poach someone, but in general I don't think you are responsible for the person/company left behind. ",1191300857

61948,comment,61901,61901,0,0,icey,,,"If you're starting a company, and you can't explain it in that amount of space, you either need to try harder or you really need to consider refining your ideas. <p>The reason the elevator pitch is such a highly stressed aspect of start-up marketing is because investors have notoriously low attention spans from listening to pitches all day, every day. <p>A solid pitch that is concise at least lets them decide if they have any interest at all before going into the deeper details. <p>The Human Genome project can be explained in less than 120 words. I have a gut-feeling that that you aren't talking about decoding DNA. ",1191299623

61937,comment,61922,61929,0,0,pius,,,"Haha, I'm curious who this is about since I know the OP.  <p>Anyway, I think it's a poorly executed attempt at being unethical.  If you had a friendship with the person who tried to poach, that person should have realized that he was going to dagger your relationship by trying to steal your partner without even pitching an idea.  <p>Given that your partner is very tight with you (and apparently barely knows the poacher), obviously the incident was going to get back to you . . . one would have expected that the poacher would have tried to partner with you guys or, at the very least, have made a damn compelling argument for why your partner would ditch you.<p>If you're gonna be shady, you've gotta be strategic about it at least.  LOL",1191298046
61935,comment,61922,61930,0,0,dfranke,,,"What are you saying is stupid?  Wanting him, or thinking they could get him?  If you all went to undergrad together, then it's possible they know more about his talent than either of you realize.  I certainly have classmates who didn't know me very well, who, while I wouldn't take them as the other half of a two-man team, I would take them as a third or fourth man give that I already had one committed partner.  And while their chances at success may have been slim, it's not like the attempt required much of an investment.",1191297927

61933,comment,61901,61909,0,0,nextmovetwo,,,"Indeed.  This was one of the problems that we faced early in our application for this session.  From what I've gathered as far as the YC app, they want to know that your company would do, not a complete run down of the process.  My advice would be to get to the point as quick as possible and use whatever else space (<= 150 words) for additional, essential details.  Good luck!",1191297712

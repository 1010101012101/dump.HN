Seems to me you can buy whole ""system on a chip"" chips today, chips that have all the functionality you need for creating a PDA (usb, bluetooth, wlan, whatever). If you know some electronics, you are probably better of soldering such a chip onto a small mainboard, rather than using the bulky bug thing. I mean those chips are probably the size of a stamp - why use a brick instead? And they do have small connectors, too.<p>Sorry, just playing devil's advocate - I sure wish them luck with Bug, I just don't really get it. 10 years ago maybe, but today?",1196616243

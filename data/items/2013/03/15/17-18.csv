Also if you read Microsoft's paper Table2, 7 hidden layer networks, which clearly qualifies as deep, work just fine with Back-propagation. Just a bigfat-MLP, no preprocessing! but 17.4 Word Error Rate (WER) vs 17.0 WER for DBN pre-training.<p>>they're not much like the old ANNs. DBNs are generative probabilistic graphical models using Bayesian inference.<p>MLPs (DNNs) can also be interpreted probabilistically. Just a directed model where inference is attained by marginalization of the hidden binary nodes in a layer-wise manner and by using a naive mean field approximation. All that to say the classic ""forward-pass"" ;).<p>Also could you indicate me a source confirming that Siri (Nuance) also switched to DNNs?. I am interested in that.<p>>Conceptually, going deeper (LOL) allows the networks to learn higher level concepts.<p>That is the really interesting part!. Now, I have not seen a proof for that. Wondering at individual neurons modeling individual features of e.g. a face or so is also a trend of the 90s and does not count as proof. I said this because it is what I usually hear.<p>Until now the justifications I saw for multiple layers of perceptrons being suitable for modeling arbitrary high level abstractions are reduced to<p>1) MLPs are universal approximators. This in my opinion is a superficial argument. GMMs also allow modeling ""any"" distribution and Taylor series any linear function, but in reality there are physical limitations to this argument. Maybe is true if you had a billion layer net, but will you get there?. If you had that computing power maybe a more realistic modeling of the brain might work better<p>2) They resemble how brain architecture works and similar arguments.

5381956,comment,5381720,5381720,1,0,tokenadult,,,"This is good advice, and the first comments don't do this helpful article justice. I have just been reading about reference checks in standard reference books about hiring (as part of updating my differing FAQ about hiring procedures before I post it to my personal website), so I can vouch for the correctness and helpfulness of what is said in the submitted article. The procedures mentioned are legal, and you are a chump if you don't use them.<p>Recycling some electrons, here is an adaptation of a comment I made on Hacker News about a year ago:<p>There is an art to checking references. Even if a company has a policy of giving bare minimum information, find out a TELEPHONE NUMBER of someone in that company who knows your candidate and start a conversation. I was given a specific script of questions to ask back in the 1990s when I was a community volunteer for my local public school district, doing reference checks on superintendent candidates. A consultant advised the school district (and through the district, me) on how to do this. If you talk to someone directly by voice, and have a good list of specific questions to ask about the candidate, you will be AMAZED at what people say, policy or no policy. Company policies don't keep people from sharing stories with curious listeners. The key is to learn what questions are legal to ask and reveal the most interesting stories about the person you are thinking of hiring. There are consultants who can advise you about checking references, and, as people who have had actual hiring authority for important jobs will say, checking references is a lot less expensive than making a wrong hiring decision. Once you've learned the questions, you know what to ask.<p>I've just asked my consultant Google, and he suggests several sets of useful questions to ask when checking references:<p><a href=""http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hiring-advice/job-screening-techniques/reference-checking-questions.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hi...</a><p><a href=""http://www.drgnyc.com/list_serve/Jan24_2005.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drgnyc.com/list_serve/Jan24_2005.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.acadweb.wwu.edu/hr/Employment/InfoForHiringOfficials/HiringPersonnel/Exempt/TelephoneReferenceChecks.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acadweb.wwu.edu/hr/Employment/InfoForHiringOffici...</a><p><a href=""http://www.best-job-interview.com/reference-check-questions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.best-job-interview.com/reference-check-questions....</a><p><a href=""http://www.k-state.edu/hr/employment/referencecheck.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.k-state.edu/hr/employment/referencecheck.htm</a><p><a href=""http://pbsbo.ucsc.edu/personnel_payroll/staff/recruit/ref_check.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pbsbo.ucsc.edu/personnel_payroll/staff/recruit/ref_ch...</a><p><a href=""http://www.bridgespan.org/Publications-and-Tools/Hiring-Nonprofit-Leaders/HiringTools/Reference-Check-More-Than-Formality.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bridgespan.org/Publications-and-Tools/Hiring-Nonp...</a><p><a href=""http://jobsearch.about.com/od/referencesrecommendations/a/refercheck.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobsearch.about.com/od/referencesrecommendations/a/re...</a><p>AFTER EDIT: My comment on the initial response to this comment of mine is that I am on record<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5227923"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5227923</a><p>as saying here on HN that if you want to hire a good worker, you should give the job applicant a work-sample test. Research tells us that, and wishful thinking can't make that untrue.<p>But if you are relying on anything said implicitly by someone's references to decide whom to hire, you had better check the references. People lie on their reference lists. They do that a lot in industries where the custom is not to check references. (We have read some stories about that here on HN over the years.) If your work-sample procedure for hiring is airtight enough, checking references may not add much to your hiring procedure, but it is legally safer to check references (to avoid employer legal exposure for negligent hiring) than to not check references. You prove you are a gentleman and a good sport by letting the honest people be discovered as honest when you check their references. Engaging in wishful thinking on this issue protects you neither legally nor practically.",1363370149

You're paying extra for each convenience and giving up some control, and this is an ongoing cost. For some people this is a great fit and they really don't want to know about this stuff, are building a demo, or working on a smaller site where you don't want to have to babysit the server and are willing to pay a little extra for that.<p>For others who are on a tight budget, or have an ops person or willing devs who would prefer to control the server setup, heroku is not such a good idea. I think people overestimate how hard it is to get a typical stack up and running and keep it up - for a small server or vps (i.e. most startups) it's probably only a few hours a month work plus a few hours learning setup, if that. The second one you set up can be up in minutes, and it gives you greater control in the long term, plus obviously it's cheaper. If the amount you pay heroku is less than a few hours of your time, then why not use heroku? However if you grow and are spending a lot of money with them, you've probably outgrown them IMHO.

You can't expect everyone to suddenly forget how\n  to use an API (with or without native syntax) just because it's for concurrency...\n  or do you?\n</code></pre>\nTaking perl as an example, they probably know how perl does file i/o. Yet if we're switching to a concurrent system, the entire practice they have of doing file i/o needs to be re-grokked. Your proposal, that learning an API is all it takes to master a form of concurrency, is a fucking joke sir. Concurrency is greater than proceduralism, it shapes the systems of code whereas writing code and hitting apis is a lower order operation: shaping code.<p><pre><code>  As for Coro, it doesn't matter how many people use it, you can write the exact same\n  things you would write in Go and it will work in the exact same way. It's not\n  cargo-culting, it's writing CSP, which you still have to actually write CSP in Go\n  if that's what you want, and it's perfectly possible not to.\n</code></pre>\nAnd how many CPAN modules can I download which I won't have to hand wrap in Coro? How many modules will expose coro based concurrency patterns?<p>I don't know about you, but most of my work is not writing code: it's using code. You miss this essential fact again and again.<p>What is possible is entirely not at all my interest here. I am interested in the practice of writing code. My sole contention against you is that the availability of libraries is irrelevant, an my basis for this point is that I agree with:<p><pre><code>  The runtime distinction isn't very important either,  [[snip]]\n</code></pre>\nThank you for repeating what I said last time in a dumbed down way. I continue to agree we have Turing complete runtimes: we can do anything. Yes, the runtime distinction is largely unimportant (although performance, natch). Adoption is. Availability of code is. Having other practitioners is important.<p><pre><code>  in fact when I hear ""runtime"" I ask ""why not library?""\n</code></pre>\nIndeed, you've done it three times now!<p>And every time you've gotten a response that agrees with your conjecture that it might be possible!<p>So why are you still making this same uncontested assertion!<p>So maybe you need to find something else to do, other than to re-describe how possible libraries make it to be Go-like or otherwise concurrent, because- with some niggling performance issues- there's been naught but agreement, and you've avoided clashing every time with my fundamental point that Go has a practicing community with some many thousands of libraries written for it, and the libraries you are talking about don't, and using your libraries will create a schizm between you and the other practioners of the parent language and the modules written for it, and Go users have no impedance when working with one another w/r/t their concurrent systems.<p><pre><code>  Some things are impossible in libraries but CSP is not among them, so I'm still\n  asking ""why not a library?"" \n</code></pre>\nFFS I ended my last post with a Turing equivalency argument that could not have been more explicit about agreeing with you. It's not about what is possible, unless you are a god and live forever and don't mind doing it all yourself. If that's in fact the case, fuck you, I'll see your ass at the fucking fields of Ragnarok. Now get off my lawn or start saying something you haven't that might be useful.<p><pre><code>  The scheduler, probably the most interesting part, can always be implemented as a\n  library.\n</code></pre>\nYes, Turing completeness. Good and acceptable performant? Meh, maybe, often actually, sure. I really could care less: I think you are so very far off in the weeds trying to discuss this, as what can be done is the most irrelevant topic when dealing with Turing machines, aka programming languages.<p><pre><code>  Can you say anything particular to Go's runtime that makes it so special? I can't\n  think of a single thing. The scheduler itself is about as boring as it gets. Not\n  that there's anything wrong with thatit's not a difficult subject after all.\n</code></pre>\nYou are a masterful troll sir. The runtime itself is not novel. The important thing I highlighted from the beginning about Go is that its standard library is written for a distinct communications oriented set of concurrency primitivies, and thus all uses of the language flow from this reference library's standard, and that creates an interesting practicing community of people all using the same communications oriented concurrency constructs. Thanks for making me spell out the value again, I hope I'm clearer this time.<p><pre><code>  As for the popularity contest goes, we might as well be talking about an iteration protocol. There are many different ones but you'd rarely notice it. The most commonly used ones are relatively less-than-great. You can always use a for-loop like you can always write a coroutine or time slicer in the worst case scenario. It works, and very well.\n\n  ???\n</code></pre>\nThe other thing is CSP. Up to now, I wasn't worried about the concurrency model in particular, but now you're saying we can't use actors, agents, etc.it must be CSP. That's BS. CSP is nice when you have to build it yourself, but it's not all there is and it's no easier to reason about than other good options. In fact I would mostly only chose it when I had to build it myself or support for something else wasn't available, which is understandably common. Really though, this sounds like a deceitful way to rule out Erlang and friends.<p><pre><code>  Please cite where I went hardline and demanded CSP as the only acceptable communications/concurrency primitive I'll amend that such that your argument here is thoroughly unnecessary- I certainly don't see myself as opposing what you are saying, but you didn't actually tell me what the clash was that arose this contention- all you said was ""The other thing is CSP. Up to now,""- and that doesn't actually inform me about what changed your mind, & made you think I was hardlining for any specific thing; so, I'm not sure how to clarify and reinforce my agreement with you, and my willingness to embrace any practioner's use of good solid helpful concurrency construct, be it of the communications variety (which I do myself enjoy, as concurrency in my artisan's mind is modeled as non-locality) or otherwise.</code></pre>",1363369148

5381799,comment,5380083,5380083,1,0,pcote,,,"Interesting skydiving analogy.  The overall advice maps pretty closely to general guidelines for going into the literal sport.<p>1.  Cut personal costs to a minimum.<p>Skydiving is an expensive sport.  You can and will spend thousands just to get the lowest level USPA license.  Plan to make cuts so you can plan to jump regularly.  Being too cheap or having an irregular jump schedule is not good for you, especially when starting out.<p>2.  Do not take funding.<p>In a few cases, a drop zone might let you clean bathrooms and pack parachutes in exchange for student jumps.  However, taking out loans isn't worth it in the long run.<p>3.  Connect with mentors and peers and listen to them.<p>Skydivers are full of opinions some of which are well-intentioned.  However, the wise student will listen to their skydiving instructor and take advice from non-instructors ( or ""peers"" in general) with a very big grain of salt.  This includes advice from the Internet.<p>4.  Don't tie yourself to one idea.<p>It's smart to have a plan but you have to make sure you have a plan B or C both in freefall and while flying a parachute.  The situation on any given skydive can turn on a dime and you have to be ready to react without panicking.<p>5.  Don't make plans or set deadlines.<p>The tag line for that is a bit deceiving with respect to what the advice here actually says.  You DO want to plan your skydive.  The bit about ""not looking back"" once you commit I can buy.  Once you're out of the plane, it's obviously too late to change your mind and go back in.",1363368889

I don't think that's a trivial thing to pick up. I think it's important to develop some of these skills but I wouldn't describe it as easy.<p>I think the key argument for Heroku is that it enables you to delay (sometimes indefinitely) learning the skills required to deploy a production application and managing it. In some cases, such as security, it can be a real bear to keep up with the latest developments in addition to managing the application itself.<p>Ultimately, I view Heroku as similar to an ORM.

That is to say, which derivative of the underlying performance indicator.  Whilst they are still growing, the rate of growth has slowed, this is at a time everyone is jumping up and down to sell more to the BRICs, most importantly China.  A Vietnamese friend of mine has a really bloody good Andriod device, I forget the brand name, good specs, good construction (argably more robust than iPhone 4 lets put glass with glass) and it cost penuts, about $100 including sales taxes.<p>So this is why I'd say, it depends on the idea of a high end device.  There are plenty  of bloody good phones at 4"" and below, but many suffer from cameras that are poor, not expandable memory etc.<p>In fact I'd dare as far to say as someone who doesn't want a good camera, can't go wrong with the Nokia 620 at 140, sim free, no contract in the UK.<p>However Nokia should be aware <i>bottom pickers get sticky fingers</i> as they say.<p>What I do think has changed, from a UK mobile phone buyers perspective is market differentiation.  In 2008 there was huge competition in the 100-200 range, but not much above.  Each firm had a 'flagship' but little effort really went it to it, they didn't expect to sell many.  the iPhone 1, which I stand by saying was a turd with a web-browser (buggy, short battery, no games, and ultimately no GPS - as a Londoner cardinal sin) came in at 1200 tco minimum.  This was a massive game changer.  If you had the cash, or didn't because it was on credit via a contract, there was nothing else near it.  It's not just a choice between a Lambo and Ford, its a Lambo or a bicycle.<p>Within about 2 years the others jumped to arrange themselves, and here 5 years on samsung has shown you can have a diverse range, something that can max out each persons budget, but still sell something to the person that only has 100.<p>Apple isn't doing that fast enough, the iPad mini is a good example of them adapting to the competition, but sitting in with a one offering, at one price point, which doesn't have: The Best Camera or The Best Games or The Best Web Browser or The Best Design, isn't going to work.  Sure some people are bought in, trapped on the ecosystem, but people fear that they are loosing product share to competitors.  This year will be a tell.  I think its unlikely Apple will be 450 come year end, much more likely 600, if they crack this mid end or 350 if they don't. imho.",1363368090

5381651,comment,5378462,5379701,3,0,guizzy,,,"You and I are very similar. I wouldn't say that I've got ADD, but I did fall into depression while in college, and have the same difficulty with managing any kind of long-term work or commitment. It also affects my personal finances; unless I set up automatic transfers to saving accounts, I am unable to keep anything for more than week or so.<p>So I ditched college at 20, was lucky enough to get a good job despite that and work from there, but as I slowly get closer to 30, I find that the world has less tolerance for my problem. I'm moving up in my professional life, and as I do I find that juggling with long term projects is starting to become more and more important to my work.<p>But anyway, you wanted help or advice.<p>One of the ways I am coping with it, is trying to make sure I can capture motivation when it happens. I guess my issue is not that I have NO motivation, but more that I am unable to summon it myself. But it happens to pop up at times, so I found that I can get things done if I remove obstacles that would stop me from using it.<p>For instance: I am trying to learn how to draw these days. It's a skill I always wanted to have and I decided to fix that. But most of the times, I don't feel like doing it. Just because I have free time doesn't mean I'm able to force myself to draw. So I always carry a sketchpad and pencils; whenever the motivation to draw crops up, I can catch it and make use of it.<p>Another example: I'm taking classes on Coursera. Sometimes I feel like listening to the lectures and doing the class work, sometimes I don't, and I can't really force myself to do it when I don't want to. However, since Coursera works well on my cell phone, I am capable of listening to the lectures anywhere at anytime.<p>Never underestimate the small stuff like doing the dishes. In my case, two things I would like to do is put some money aside and lose some weight. As ridiculous as it sounds, making sure I deal appropriately with the dishes is crucial to attaining these goals. Why? One of the biggest reasons I can't save money and that I am getting fatter is because I am always eating takeout or delivery. It is both expensive, and unhealthy. I would really like to cook more; I love cooking. But as I said before, you need to remove any obstacles beforehand if you want to be able to capture the motivation when it happens. Having to do the dishes before cooking is such an obstacle. Having to go to the grocery store is an obstacle to cooking. So something as small as a dishes problem, is stopping me from dealing with my cooking problem, which is stopping me from dealing with my money and health problems.<p>I try to have many hobbies going at once; the more things I have that I could be doing, the more likely that there'll be at least one of those things I'll be wanting to do in my free time.<p>I also try to keep the work divided in smaller chunks and set small, tiny goals for myself. For instance, like yours probably is, my room is a stupid mess. Worse than a messy teenager's. I would never be able to tackle clearing ALL of it; it's waaaaay beyond any motivation I can muster. But at some point I wanted to use my desk. So when the motivation came up for it, I cleaned up the clutter on desk. Same thing with the laundry; one load at a time. My room is still a stupid mess, but at least there's a few parts of it I'm keeping clean.<p>That's another tip: keep things clean, clear and done as you go. Never rely on future you, that dude will disappoint you. Most people are able to leave things get a little messy, then clean up for an hour or so and are done with it. You are not. You need make a habit of doing things immediately, on the spot. For instance; do the dishes immediately after eating: all of them, always, even if you have guests. If you let them pile up, no matter how small the pile, that will be one pile you will never really want to deal with until it becomes a problem.<p>Anyway, good luck. I'm rooting for you.",1363367707

It creates a good shared base of stuff on which to build.<p>But when it comes to services, totally free can <i>sometimes</i> be bad. That's because there's no such thing as a service that's free to run, so the money has to come from somewhere. Either the service is being monetized through some backdoor method -- usually something involving privacy intrusion or data mining -- or it's what economists call ""dumping.""<p>Dumping is when you flood a market with free or below-cost goods to kill competitors, and then jack up the price or even kill the market when the competitors are gone. The best example in software is Internet Explorer, which (prematurely) killed the market for browsers and led to the horrible age of total IE dominance of the web.<p>Google Reader may well have been -- whether intentionally or not -- dumping. If it was intentional, it might be an effort to kill RSS entirely. The big players -- Google, Facebook, etc. (are there more?) -- all have a vested interest in killing independent less centralized ways of aggregating knowledge in order to steer all traffic to them.<p>I still use a Mac reader called NewsFire.

From the article:<p>""The most novel thing here is ""retrieves the database"". In Datomic, you have the concept of the ""value of the database"" - the database as a whole, as a data structure. The Peer Library is responsible for pulling as much of that data structure into memory as necessary to satisfy your queries.<p>In this way, your queries run largely in your application rather than in a central database server, allowing for easy read scalability. It gives more power to your application rather than keeping all the power in a central server, where you have to worry about bottlenecks.<p>Finally, Datomic does not implement its own storage solution but instead relies on storage as a service, allowing you to choose which storage backend you use.

What happened was that after a short period of time I had +1000 unread posts. At this point I stopped using RSS for a while because it was just too much noise. A few months back I discovered RSS again for myself but this time I did not subscribe to every site I found interesting. There are a lot of news sites which I visit often and they also have a feed in most cases. I do not subscribe to them because I visit them anyway and they are most of the time high volume feeds. Instead I only subscribe to sites (almost always interesting blogs from fellow developers) who write a new post maybe three times a year or so and I only subscribe to blogs from developers/people who only post if they have something very important to say. This made RSS useful to me again because I would never every remember to visit all those sites twice a year If I see a unread item in my RSS reader I know that I have to read this post soon because it will blow my mind again.<p>Who of you is doing it in a similar way?",1363367126

The author is absolutely, positively, without a doubt correct in his stance on this. Being called in such a way and having very little and/or weak security protocols as described is not only a security breach waiting to happen but it really is, as the author points out, training people to get phished.<p>But there's a bigger picture here. And that's the picture of Vanguard as a company having years of experience in talking to, working with, dealing with, and learning about their customers. Just like the manager says in the post, they need to balance security with service (no they're not mutually exclusive but they're not one and the same either).<p>In the end I think this okay. It's not technically correct but it seems like its the right thing to do. Now the reason for this call is never described (which gives some credence to the theories here that this actually never happened along with a lack of other details) but assuming here for the sake of argument that the call was just to talk about something that isn't of super high significance (let's say it was a sales call to upsell something) then a couple of security questions should suffice. If it's to talk about a 10 million dollar bank transfer to some off-shore account then maybe we should be in an uproar here.<p>Another point to consider is who is responsible for security? Obviously the company that hold your data should be reponsible for the safety of that data and should have measures in place to prevent fraudulent access to it. But then there's also the responsibility of the customer who needs to take care of their account credentials and make sure that if someone accesses one of their private accounts somewhere that there isn't a domino effect. I don't think it's Vanguard's responsibility to make sure that all of their customers use different, long, and random passwords on their Gmail and Facebook and what have you so that one day someone can access one of those and get into their Vanguard account. I mean, that's certainly a nice-to-have but customers have a responsibility to secure their data just the same as companies do. We want to be educating regular folks about security all the time but the moment it comes time for them to apply what we're teaching them we turn around and act like they're off the hook for being ignorant of security best practices. It's a double standard if you ask me.<p>I know we all like some good old fashioned manufactured outrage but before we get the pitchforks out let's look at the big picture, and not <i>just</i> one aspect of the issue here.",1363367104

But if the government is hell bent enough in taking your money (usually happens when you debt is taxes debt) it can try that.<p>Brazil has two types of heirs, mandatory, and others. You cannot give more than 50% of your inheritance to others in your will, the point of that law is to now allow someone to give money to a distant cousin instead of wife, kids or parents. The issue is that this law summed with the debt inheritance, means that distant cousins are potential (But not mandatory) heirs of your debt, and evil enough government lawyers can make it happen...<p>My guess is that this was setup because Brazillians had the habit to go in debt sprees when they knew they would die (for example, guy know he has cancer, then he buys a yatch and enjoys himself until he dies, this law is to prevent that, but the side effects are terrible).",1363367091

I managed to finish my PhD by 26, but the reason is because I was comfortable with turning it in imperfect (and expected to do so from 24 on, after initial grad student optimism was burned out of me). I've had friends who spent years on a thesis past when it was done by any sane definition of the word just because they wanted it to be perfect.

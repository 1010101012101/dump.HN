2949058,comment,2943906,2944129,1,0,nirvana,,,"I'm sorry, I was making a different point.  I didn't mean to imply that deterrent force is immoral... just that the amount is something that needs to be arbitrated, rather than decided solely by the victim of the crime.  That is to say, if you stole a car and used it for a week, you'd owe equivalent to the rental of the car, and whatever else is necessary to make he owner whole -- thus that includes compensation for any consequential results (like, maybe he lost money because he'd been hired to do a job and couldn't' do that job during the week because you had his car.)   There's also, from the perspective I was describing, a compensation that covers hassle, inconvenience, and the fact that your actions were morally wrong. So, yes, there should be a deterrence and yes, it is owed to the victim, but it should be adjudicated.  Its possible that violating the privacy of the thief is crime that is greater than the actual theft of the laptop in the first place (if you were to reduce both to monetary damages.)",1314863748

It seems that they breach everything - it;s a terrible deal for consumers.<p>So why are AT&T and their investment bankers pushing so hard for this deal? There is certainly an agency cost - the execs at AT&T want to do a deal and run a bigger company, and their lawyers and bankers want the deal to go ahead so they van get paid. However T-Mobile has to spend money on lawyers and bankers as well, and so some of that breakup fee will be used to pay them, as well as T-Mobile itself.<p>AT&T were banking on a compliant DOJ, and to be fair over the last decade there was very little push-back from any of the  regulators.

The new site will be good for one or two years, then it will hit mainstream and lolcats will ensue.

Most of the posts portray the same quality as HN (many a times even more than HN IMHO, maybe there is a section common between the two sites). The problem is, HN is never not serious. That does not seem right to me. I must be able to joke about my work. We also don't have to be judgmental about other people's work.

Of course you are not going to find smart people on every damn reddit. After all reddit is a general purpose site and thus many people are not what you would consider ""smart"". Damn, there are people who come to reddit ""just to have a good time"". Fools they are. Internet is all about having intelligent discussions dammit ;)<p><i>I do not think they are comparable at all.

2948992,comment,2948873,2948873,81,0,waterhouse,,,"On a faintly related note, I once was calculating partitions, using a relatively inefficient method (memoization: if f(n,k) is the number of distinct ways to express n as the unordered sum of integers no greater than k, then f(n,k) = f(n-k,k) + f(n,k-1)).  My computer started to feel the strain in the thousands (this algorithm is O(n^2) in space and time).  I then googled for the partition of, say, 1034, which is:<p><pre><code>  91363785902248291467082481888195
</code></pre>
I figured that chances are that no website will have that integer on there by accident.  Lo and behold, I found, among other results, a text file containing the partitions up to 10,000, presumably done with a more efficient algorithm (likely Euler's ridiculous pentagonal-number recurrence formula, which, memoized, is roughly O(n^1.5) in time and O(n) in space): <a href=""http://oeis.org/A000041/b000041.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oeis.org/A000041/b000041.txt</a>",1314861899

Both are capable of thousands of requests per second, but Nginx arguably does it better with its event-based architecture (opposed to Apache being process based). The config syntax is also refreshingly simple, so converting .htaccess rules couldn't be easier.<p>We were recently paying a small fortune for hosting one of our websites. It was bumping up against memory limits even after a serious code rework and aggressive caching. Instead of upgrading we decided to test a new config using Nginx.<p>Now we run three sites, one fairly popular, on a 512Mb Linode with Nginx, APC, FPM, Varnish and a CDN, and it can take an amazing amount of load. Varnish needs memory, but without Varnish we could run this setup on a box a fraction of the size.<p>This plan costs $19/month! I still can't believe we're paying so little.<p>Instead of focussing just on the server though, and like the TumbleDry article somewhat suggests, HTTP cache is probably the best place to start in terms of performance. Varnish, CDNs, etc all rely on intelligent HTTP caching. And if you do it right, you don't need to worry (too often) about cache invalidation.<p>What I'm really looking forward to is making use of ESI in Symfony2 and Varnish. That will mean setting different cache headers for portions of pages, which will further reduce the need to manually invalidate cache.<p>For now though, I'm loving Nginx + FPM + APC.",1314861454

The latest batch of discussion sites and tools (reddit, news.yc, digg, /., etc.) are simply the latest and best models of a continuously growing and improving application space.<p>I think the only way for a ""community"" to exist long term in this space is to either continue advancing the state of it's filtering tools in order to handle the increased load, or not, and let it naturally degrade back into a smaller community and just exist at the level that it is capable of filtering (though this is not as simple as a community capable of holding X users will always have X users -- momentum and network effects are definitely important here).",1314861448

I&#x27;ve heard the term the Sharing economy before but I didn&#x27;t know these companies were trying to reappropriate the word. It takes quite a bit of cognitive dissonance to be convinced that what you&#x27;re doing is sharing even when you&#x27;re taking people&#x27;s money.<p>Back when I was a teenager, I dreamt up that the women&#x27;s rights movement was ultimately a ploy by the capitalist class to dilute the value of labor in the market. Technology has done the same with our time by making us surrender the concept of off time. Now this sharing economy wants to take away our space and stuff.

For example, they might not like that the domain has &quot;Tumblr&quot; in it but lacks the perceived aesthetic flair of Tumblr.  That juxtaposition might cross some (non-legal) threshold for them.<p>I&#x27;m just speculating, obviously.  My point is more that inside a company of any size, but especially one that&#x27;s large enough, there are a whole set of concerns being balanced.  If it&#x27;s too hard to balance they&#x27;re likely to choose the path of least resistance.<p>Who knows?  I&#x27;ve done some work with software that integrated with Tumblr and my sense is that as an organization Tumblr really values control over all else.<p>Other companies have different personalities.  Facebook is cold, calculating, and absolutely rational.  They&#x27;ll promote the shit out of you if it&#x27;s advantageous and leave you hanging the second it&#x27;s not.  Google is passive-aggressive.  Twitter is afraid of being intermediated.<p>But, yeah, if I were to describe the quality of Tumblr&#x27;s personality it would be Mini-Me to Apple&#x27;s Dr. Evil.  What would Apple do if someone had a website called &quot;isappledown.com?&quot;  That&#x27;s what Tumblr would do.<p>You&#x27;ve gotta know the temperament of the animal you&#x27;ve decided you want to ride.",1377945234

Some can&#x27;t. For instance, workers on your local railway can for up wages because the railway can&#x27;t move, and local people need it. Software can be written anywhere, so if US wages are high, it will be written elsewhere.<p>And you do see this. US wages, and Japanese wages, are higher than in Europe for developers. Here in the UK, a lot of engineering is essentially R&D outsourced from the US to a place with cheaper STEM workers.<p>At the same time, I feel wages can be at current levels because developers don&#x27;t realize how much they are worth. A big part of this is because it&#x27;s hard to link revenues, even at a software company, to an individual developers achievement. If profit is a pie(chart) carved up between different workers and the share holders, then the worker who has best visibility how the money gets there, and how they contributed, will do best.

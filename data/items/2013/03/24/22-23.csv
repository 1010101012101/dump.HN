The biggest problem I've found to making this at home is getting graphite oxide. They are expensive on the net (google it, not linking any store because I don't know any trustworthy), or hard to make (the usual method requires strong oxiders like sulfuric acid) [2]. There is a bottom-up approach to making them, that uses glucose [3], but I have no idea how hard it is, I need help from someone more knowledgeable in Chemistry before I try it.

5434196,comment,5432713,5434110,4,0,gnosis,,,"I definitely had trouble sitting for long periods in the lotus or half-lotus position.  Due to a year's worth of stretching, I'm easily able to get in to these positions, but my knees and back start to hurt after a while -- and this makes it difficult to concentrate on just the breath.<p>So, I've been experimenting with meditating while lying down.  This is far more comfortable, but then I have to really fight falling asleep.  Sometimes I've succeeded, other times I have fallen asleep.  Eating a big meal right before doing any kind of meditation is not recommended if you want to stay awake!<p>Another tip is to make sure your cell phone is off and you have a ""do not disturb"" sign on your door.  There's nothing more frustrating than finally achieving a deep meditative state and then being interrupted by some triviality.<p>In the last few days I've tried sitting in full lotus again, and have noticed that it's starting to get less painful -- though one of my legs does has gone totally numb after a while.  I've been able to do about one hour of meditation in full lotus so far.  The two and three hour meditations have all been while I was lying down.<p>I don't think I have any definative answers for you on how to work your way up to meditating for this long.  I'm just a beginner myself.  I think playing chess all my life has helped with my ability to conentrate.  On the other hand, in my ordinary life I'm very prone to becoming bored and do a lot of task-switching (especially on the computer, where I spend way too much time), which has hurt my ability to concentrate.<p>I did find the technique of focusing just on my breath to be very useful.  As described in ""Mindfulness in Plain English"", I try to focus on the feeling of my breath as it enters and leaves the tip of my nose.  If other thoughts or feelings come up, I don't fight them, but try to return my attention to the feeling of my breath entering and leaving the tip of my nose.<p>I've found that this type of concentration is easier on some days than others.  On some days I have a lot of thoughts racing through my mind.  If I've seen an exciting movie, for instance, I might have a lot of images from that movie flashing through my mind, or I may be thinking of events that happened in that movie while I'm trying to meditate.  That's frustrating, and those days tend to be less productive.  On other days, however, I might not have a lot on my mind.  Those are the days when I can focus on my breath for a long time.",1364165878

I do most of my commuting by bus, and mostly drive my car nights and weekends, when the bus doesn't run as often, or my few trips out of town - most months I only fill up once. That said, I wouldn't get rid of my car: I live in one of about 15 cities in Canada large enough to have a decent bus system [1, >300,000 people], and when I make the 15 hour drive a quarter of the way across the country to visit my family, I need the car to get around, because they live 10 kilometres from the nearest town large enough to have a supermarket. Public transit is awesome, but most of my country simply doesn't have the population density to support it (the distances and travel times are similar in the US, though there are more cities, so I understand the car culture)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo05a-eng.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/d...</a>",1364165793

All you have to do is to be amazing  at what you do.  You made the mistake once, you paid you dues, so life goes on.  I agree with the parent post -- you should build a great online presence to bury the past, to prove that you are a new person.<p>I once worked with a friend I made online.  He's a great designer.  I refered him to another good friend for some work, and this other friend found out the designer had been on the news for a felony a few years back ( long story short, he pretty much used his design/photoshop skills and got into trouble with the laws).  His case got cleared afterward, but searching for his name on Google still returns the articles from the past.<p>My other friend didn't work with the guy because of this, but in the end, my designer friend is still happy because he got his life in order.  He's a great guy and he didn't let his past impact him too much.  He even helped me when I needed some money to survive, he was there to send me some work for the badly needed few hundred bucks.<p>Good luck.  Life is too short to worry too much about the past.  Learn new skills, make new friends, become an awesome developer to create more values for society.  Look at rappers like JayZ or 50Cents for inspirations.  They were put in jails, shots multiple times, and yet they are hugely successful entrepreneurs now.<p>If you're good, people can't ignore you for long.

Thomas Merton, Thomas Keating, Catholic tradition of mysticism, etc.  Key book:  ""Open mind, open heart"" by Keating.

Alone every morning, with a group twice per month.<p>What effects or benefits have you experienced?<p>- Better (but still not great) at keeping my mouth shut and listening to others<p>- Used to engage in a range of behaviors such as procrastination to keep a whole catalog of anxiety-producing thoughts tamped down and below the conscious mental radar screen.  By now, the anxiety-producing thoughts have by and large come to the surface and evaporated, rendering those avoidance behaviors unnecessary.<p>- Bouts of depression, while just as intense and severe when the come, now last a day or two as opposed to many weeks.<p>- Artistic and aesthetic sensibilities are more acute.<p>- Willingness to accept the humdrum rhythms of life with more equanimity.<p>- Left defense industry and now write software for a medical device company.<p>- Grew out of a romantic fantasy about what ""enlightenment"" might mean, and am now content with the the ""meat and potatoes"" of living life in the present moment.

That's the distinction that Daniel Ingram made between <i>concentration</i> exercises and <i>insight</i> meditation. In the latter, you start by gaining access concentration to your object (breathing, or whatever), and then <i>deliberately</i> seek out one of the Three Fundemental Characteristics: things come and go (impermanence), they don't satisfy (suffering), and it isn't you (no self).<p>So for example, once you reach access concentration on breathing, you can see hone in on the specific physical sensations and try to find any part of it that is actually ""permanent"". You're looking for the transience of not only the inhale and the exhale, but also the transience of what appears to be solid neural signals are actually high-frequency sensations. Go deeper, and you start observing how these sensations trigger other, in kind of a cascade effect -- exactly what was mentioned in <i>Chuang-Tzu</i> on the wind blowing through the openings of the world.<p>I point this out because it's not that the teachings lead you to the practice, but rather, the teachings come <i>from</i> the practice. You are essentially ""reverse engineering"" the teaching with your personal practice. When I look around, I see how teachings from around the world derive from the insights realized (experienced) in practice. And since the practice is ""experience reality, <i>all</i> of reality"", then of course there is a commonality.<p>Heh, having said that, some teachings are easier to absorb than others, depending on where you think you are and who you think you are. I guess I want to leave open the possibility, to not to have strong attachment to the specific teachings themselves when you practice.",1364165095

At some point, the elected representatives in Congress have to make a law to regulate the interstate commerce. In Filburn's case, a majority of the democratically-elected officials in Congress decided that price stabilization of crops was important enough to restrict growing ""private stashes"" that weren't going to be sold. If supporters of Filburn didn't agree with that, then they would have to elect new representatives to do overturn the law. (Which by the way, will probably finally happen sometime in the next decade.) But there is zero support in Congress for restricting FOSS, even when it competes with commercial software.

Meditation is a practice that helps us override these stress responses, and for many people meditation is a better tool than attempting to override those stress responses with thoughts.

However, I would strongly disagree with you that such an attraction to exoticism is a reason for completely disregarding meditation.<p>After all, many things that are common in Western societies (some of which you might actually value quite highly) are considered exotic in non-Western societies, and might be valued for their exoticism.  Usually, these are material goods such as cars, houses, clothes, food -- but not always -- Western music is also quite a hot cultural commodity.  Do you avoid listening to Western music because it might be considered exotic in some other culture?<p>Something else to take in to consideration is that meditation is highly valued in many non-Western cultures.  Even in non-Western cultures, meditation is rarely considered ""worthless"" to the same extent as common fruits and berries would be in South Africa.  Common, maybe.  Worthless?  It would really depend on the person, but many in non-Western cultures value meditation quite highly (more so than most Westerners would value it, I'd wager).<p>Finally, I think that many strongly negative views of practices that are strongly valued in other cultures usually are rooted in xenophobia and deep ignorance.  Some people don't know and don't want to know about such practices simply because they seem strange or different.  I find that really sad.",1364162908

5433970,comment,5433276,5433276,4,0,zerovox,,,"Just thought I would give my impressions of how this <i>might</i> go down if you interviewed for the large start-up I work for. (I'm speaking from my own experience, not on behalf of the company in any way.)<p>1.Why? You're resume will be glanced at, not much more. We just care about how much experience you've had, so we can aim the right kind of questions at you. (You like Haskell? Try this) As long as you don't claim to be a master in ten languages after 2 years real world experience, it really wont matter. Just list your alma mater, your previous companies, and what you like working on or with, and you'll do fine.<p>2. I'd recommend against it, you'll come off as creepy if you mention or slip up any of the details. And whilst you're at it, avoid looking up common interview questions for the company, everyone uses different ones and it's extremely obvious if you already know the optimal solution.  And if you do get asked a question you know the answer, or someone else from the company has already asked you, tell the interviewer and they'll ask you something else. It's worth it, anything sneaky or underhand comes off extremely badly and is usually enough to get you rejected.<p>3. I've rejected many candidates from internal referrals, and usually people are pretty honest with their referrals, they'll say if they don't know enough about you. It's not in anyone's interest to hire someone who isn't a 100% fit, so if you ask me for a referral, I'll only fight for you if I know you're good for the job and my colleagues will do likewise. There's a difference between asking for a referral and being asked to apply. If you really want an 'in', find the companies GitHub and start sending pull requests, if your code is good, you take the reviewers advice and get your patches merged, someone will get in contact.<p>4. Finally, one I agree with! You'll be asked a range of algorithm based questions, coding based questions and more, so get comfortable with these kinds of questions.<p>5. Again, I agree. But it's usually obvious if you're feigning passion, so be passionate and let it show. Push for the optimal solutions, if you don't get there, ask what the best solution was. When they ask if you have any questions, ask what they do, what their role is and what you could end up doing. Figure out if it is for you, and if so, say so!<p>6. Maybe this applies to other companies, but we wont ask 'trap' questions. They aren't useful to us, they're too easy to avoid. However, avoiding a question is never a good idea. Also, questions like ""What was the result the last time you and a coworker disagreed on a technical issue?"" aren't trap questions, they are real life situations. These things happen, and as long as you can demonstrate that you are reasonable and mature, you'll do fine. Even if you say, ""I tested both hypothesis, and he was correct, so we went with his way, I apologized and learnt from the situation"", that okay! We're engineers interviewing you, we realise people can be wrong, showing an ability to learn is great.<p>7. I agree! Don't lie. That should go without saying.<p>8. Again, that should go without saying.<p>9. Again, as with the algorithms one above, if you don't know what a linked list is, you're applying to the wrong job.<p>10. This probably the only non-trivial point of the article. Building things is a great add a bit to your CV. I can't speak for my colleagues, but of I have a candidate that has build something I can take a look at, I'll spare 5 minutes before the interview to take a look, especially if it sounds interesting or complex. From me, expect a question about how you got round a certain problem or how you built it. It gives you a great chance to show your enthusiasm and show that you want to build and ship code.<p>These are just <i>my</i> impressions, not definitive by any means, I'd be interested to other experiences interviewing(or indeed being interviewed).",1364162875

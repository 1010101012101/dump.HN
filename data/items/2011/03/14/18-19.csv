2323872,comment,2322696,2323468,0,0,chrisrhoden,,,"The anti-hipster culture is hilarious.<p>It is impossible for me to read this without pointing out that after a very well-reasoned and largely accurate argument against the completely irrational spite, you close with a (admittedly small) taste of the very disgust you just denounced. ""I <i>luckily</i> rarely come across 'hipsters'.""<p>It's pervasive, even in the group itself. Hipster doesn't actually mean anything specific to anyone, it simply means, ""a member of the counterculture which I find offensive at the moment."" And, shocker, the people who you would consider, ""hipsters,"" are just as guilty of this.<p>The problem with this, from my perspective, is that it's also a catch-all for people who are difficult to categorize. Even before the word was co-opted to be a generally negative term, it was nebulous at best, referring generally to young people who are interested in culture or art or food or music or, really, anything.<p>As a result of this, people get lumped into this group based on these very general terms, and then assumptions are made about their character by regurgitating every complaint anyone has slapped the word ""hipster"" after, as though it's representative of everyone who wears sweaters. No, not everyone who has a moustache is an elitist. Not everyone who smoked pot in college loves Bob Marley, do they?<p>I encourage people to stop using this word at all. It's just stupid, meaningless, and devoid of positive connotations for most of the world.",1300129125

I suggest that the problem GroupOn solves--selling the capacity--is not the hard problem for this scenario, the hard problem is getting away with pricing discrimination.<p>Maybe, but it depends on the product or service too.

Making it for everyone is hard as we all have competing interests. The thing about having immediate content available from my past makes it easier for me to contribute without having to come up with something to make the app immediately useful for me. The first engagement is the most important and will help the user decide if the app is worth it or not. That's why I always use gravatar yet allow the users to add/edit their photo in my apps. It's a personalized welcome, like they do at nice hotels.<p>Don't worry about the UI too much. A good one requires a professional to focus on that alone for awhile to get it right. A good one costs money. That can all come in time.<p>Google analytics are fine, there are some other packages out there that you can slip on, but when I do usability tests, I measure exactly how many clicks each button/action receives and valuate their purpose to the app based on those metrics, so yes, some internal metrics will be very valuable to you in order to dole out resources to the app, and if you're so inclined, give some light metrics to the user to show them how many times their particular project was visited. It's a cheap trick (like karma) but people are people and they enjoy validation.<p>Also, if you think of it, listing the number of active projects in your app on the homepage is another easy come-on and helps conversion, just like McDonald's has been doing for decades now.",1300128384

The existence of massive loss of life nearby does not diminish its importance.<p>* The earthquake+tsunami event is unlikely to get worse and there little people are able to do to prevent it anyway.<p>* Conflicting information keeps coming out about possible worst case scenarios (and their relative likelihoods) with the nuclear reactors.<p>* Some of these scenarios are, in fact, much worse than even the current unimaginably bad scenario. Just because things are bad doesn't mean they couldn't get worse.<p>* This has definite implications this for US and global energy policy. In my view, it's probably best to hold off that debate until these incidents are concluded and informs our hindsight, but the discussion is inevitable.<p>* The nuclear incidents are affecting rescue and cleanup. Rescue is hard enough without a 20km evacuation going on at the same time. For example there are reports that the US Navy had some ships which needed to relocate due to detected radiation.<p>* Tokyo, one of the largest cities in the world, faces a power shortage.

Yes, if you have some pure, functional code, and then you decide you want to have a feature that uses state, fixing things up can be a bit tedious. I think there's an interesting space here for refactoring tools that help take out the tedium. I will also note that this restriction is a good thing sometimes: you know how you add a global here and a global there and suddenly  you have an unmaintainable blob of global state?

If you're trying to make a living, you have to attempt to sell yourself at whatever level you're at, then work to keep improving. It's the customer's responsibility to do due diligence and discover potentially critical gaps in expertise, not the provider's to trumpet his/her own weaknesses. This is just the nature of a marketplace.<p>The hacker who postures a bit in order to get a job he isn't truly suited for, but works hard to get up to speed and does his best, will be much better off in the long run than a hacker who declines the project, even if it leads to problems for the buyer later on.

Even then a reference counting system is often better.<p>Answer excerpted:<p><i>As for the garbage collector. Use it as is first. If later you find performance issues use lua_gc to fine tune its behavior.</i><p><i>Some examples:</i><p><i>Disable the garbage collector during those times when the slow down would be a problem.</i><p><i>Leave the garbage collector disabled and only step it when game logic says you've got some head room on your FPS count. You could pre-tune the step size, or discover the optimal step size at runtime.</i><p><i>Disable the collector and perform full collection at stopping points, ie a load screen or cut scene or at turn change in a hot seat game.</i><p><i>You might also consider an alternative scripting language. Squirrel tries very hard to be a second generation Lua. It tries to keep all of Lua's good features, while ditching any of its design mistakes. One of the big differences between the two is squirrel uses reference counting instead of garbage collection. It turns out that reference counting can be a bit slower than garbage collection but it is very deterministic(AKA realtime).</i>",1300126132

6077855,comment,6077025,6077025,5,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"This kind of collective hand wringing always gives me a chuckle.  I&#x27;m from Vancouver and moved down to the valley in 1998.  My rationale:<p><pre><code>  - Vancouver has a high cost of living without commensurate salaries (and often no equity).\n  - Because of the wealth of technology companies, it&#x27;s easy to find a job here.\n  - The weather (at least in the valley) is far better than sitting in the rain (Vancouver), or snow (rest of the country).\n  - Quasi-reasonable immigration policy (TN-1 visas are easy to get, although have weird drawbacks)\n  - A common language, and a fairly similar culture.\n  - Proximity to home (it&#x27;s only a 2 1/4 hour flight back to Vancouver with no time change -- can someone start flying out of SJC instead of only SFO?).\n</code></pre>\nThe start-up culture really fuels the tech industry here.  Since moving in &#x27;98, I&#x27;ve been through two IPOs where both companies ended up having billion+ dollar valuations.  I think the reason why it&#x27;s so successful is because of reasons I (and others) have already mentioned, but also because of:<p><pre><code>  - decent universities\n  - former military/government technology jobs\n  - easy access to capital\n</code></pre>\nand probably most importantly, past success.  The Bay Area has this unique ecosystem where companies have been bootstrapped from nothing except an idea, and that gives other people confidence to try their own hand at a startup.  This feedback loop is what keeps the valley humming.<p>After having been so successful being an employee at two startups that did well, I started my own company a couple of weeks ago.  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing the amount of support you get here, and the network of people who you can tap to ask questions and help out in your venture.<p>Vancouver and Toronto both have parts of the equation, but they don&#x27;t have the whole package.  And neither of them have the kind of past success which breeds future success.",1374382706

(but which is  basically a rehashed version of oriental exoticism made slightly more palatable for the highly educated, western upper middle classes he&#x27;s pandering to.)<p>My simple question to Gladwell is this: If Korean culture explains the bad safety record of Korean air, what explains the excellent safety record of the japanese airlines. All Nippon (No fatal accidents in more than 40 years) and JAL (last fatal crash in 1985 and even that due to mechanical failure) ?\n Does that record prove that Japanese culture is not only completely different from Korean culture (in-as-much as respect for elders and superiors is concerned) but it would also imply that Japanese culture is somehow better for air-safety than that of all the other national airlines of the world who&#x27;ve had a far worse safety record than those two airlines.<p>I&#x27;d be really interested in hearing how Gladwell&#x27;s cockamamie, quasi-racist theories explain the above.

6077829,comment,6077025,6077744,5,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>&quot;then why doesn&#x27;t the sector expand to take advantage of the low wages?&quot;</i><p>It is. See: the huge presence of multinationals in Canada like IBM, SAP, even gaming giants like EA and Ubisoft. The Canadian tech industry is by no means shrinking, it&#x27;s just growing in a way that doesn&#x27;t fit Silicon Valley&#x27;s &quot;high pay, high benefits&quot; mold. Canada has not seen the massive software engineering wage explosion that the US has.<p>Which naturally leads to your next question:<p>> <i>&quot;Contrarily, if the sector is small because high wages attract workers to the states, why can&#x27;t Canadian companies pay as much as the American companies?&quot;</i><p>This is a big and complicated question. The short answer is: because it somehow got this way and now we can&#x27;t change it.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that the US tech industry isn&#x27;t all shuttles and gourmet meals either - the bulk of the industry is paid a fraction of Silicon Valley salaries, with none of the cushy benefits. The tech industry is divided into the low/mid-end and the high-end, and the two sides could not be more different.<p>There is an active war for talent in the high-end that keeps driving up salaries and benefits, while low/mid-end software engineering remains relatively stagnant. It&#x27;s largely a group of companies working on computationally hard problems that&#x27;s driving this war - folks like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. These companies are uninterested in low/mid-end talent, confining the insane salaries to only a small segment of the total industry.<p>This segment of the industry also largely does not exist in Canada. Canada&#x27;s tech scene has, for many complex and perhaps unexplainable reasons, developed into one that is largely enterprisey. The tech jobs are largely at not-tech companies (where you&#x27;re a cost center, not a profit center), and where they <i>are</i> at tech companies, they are at satellite offices of American or European companies.<p>This doesn&#x27;t create a market where there is high demand for top-level talent. Complicating this somewhat is the fact that the talent war in the US has bled across the border, thanks to relatively easy immigration laws for Canadian citizens - the bleeding of talent to the south prevents the establishing of companies locally that would feed on a top-level talent pool.<p>So this really circles back to OP&#x27;s original complaint. The reason why wages aren&#x27;t rising in Canada is because companies that <i>demand</i> high talent do not exist in Canada. There are no major companies working on truly hard problems that would demand campuses full of top-level engineers, and thus no drivers for salary growth.<p>The companies that <i>do</i> exist cannot raise salaries wildly for a few reasons. Firstly, because they are not having trouble finding talent <i>at the level they want</i> at their existing salaries. Secondly, because their business model may <i>rely</i> on being cheaper than the US. Thirdly, there is a lack of institutional employers who employ high-end engineers which would kickstart a talent war.",1374382165

I know that it isn&#x27;t really anything new, but I thought that I did a solid job of articulating things that people think, but don&#x27;t necessarily know how to say.  I know that personally, I always sort of thought them in an abstract sense, but after writing this essay I became more aware of what it is I was actually thinking.  So for that reason, I thought people might like it enough to give it significant upvotes.<p>Anyway, I understand what you&#x27;re saying about this being insulting, and about self-awareness, but I respectfully disagree.  While I may have came across as an asshole, I am actually a benevolent person.  I care about the world and the happiness of society.  There are a lot of things I think I can do in my lifetime to drastically improve the world.  One of them, is making people more rational.<p>I think that self-awareness, among other things, would be a consequence of rationality.  By thinking rationally, by definition - <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/</a>, you&#x27;re making the right choices.  Encouraging self-awareness would have its benefits, but I think that encouraging rationality would have those same benefits, as well as many many others.<p>Regarding the insulting nature of calling people stupid, I think it&#x27;s necessary.  I feel hesitant to do so, but I really really think it needs to be done.  In our culture, people are so reluctant to disagree with one another and offer constructive criticism.  It is ridiculous.  People are always encouraging irrational thought by saying &quot;you can think whatever you want to&quot;.  It&#x27;s ok to disagree.  Me calling people stupid is my way of proclaiming mass disagreement.  Granted, I could do so in a less insulting way.  Still, I think that the costs of me insulting people are outweighed by the benefits of 1) the fact that it gets peoples attention, and 2) it more clearly conveys my point than me saying that &quot;people make epistemically and instrumentally irrational decisions both frequently, and about important things&quot;.<p>Note: I think this conversation would be more productive and clear by me giving an example of people being stupid, so you could picture that in your mind instead of the abstract concept of people being stupid.  People don&#x27;t put thought into what they&#x27;re going to do with their lives.  They just choose from the handful of options that are common for the neighborhood in which they grew up.

They are playing a game based around skimming profits out of everyday business activities where there is any surface area that investors and speculators might be playing.

The problem is the drag in supply by the warehouse game increases costs overall.<p>There are people playing games with different commodities and your interests are in protecting the game instead of making efficient markets.

Nintendo and Sony excelled in part because Japan was a perfect playground for testing personal technologies.  Walmart had 300 million customers, 90% of which live in extremely developed locations, which allowed for retail stores to spread quickly and profitably across the states.<p>Further, having a history of less than 50 years means that less sustained activity has likely been driven from within Canada as opposed to from overseas.  Given the choice of where to locate, a tycoon from Toronto had the choice of working out of London.",1374380015

All devices running linux will have /dev/console tied to UART.<p>2. For others, typically a printf routine would write to UART.<p>The problem the article talks about occurs when the OEM &quot;forgets&quot; to turn off the UART (either in software or just by breaking the pins during manufacturing).",1374379709

You literally have to rip out anything that uses char * in the code base and replace it with a unicode supported alternative, which is both more complex, and <i>breaks python 2 backwards compatibility</i>.<p>Pypy is very clever in how they handle this through rpython, which is why they can kind of support both; but randomly dropping cpython 2.x code into the project is completely not forward looking.<p>I&#x27;d be happy with: &quot;We never intend to support python 3, sorry&quot;.<p>If that&#x27;s the path you want to walk for all the complicated reasons you choose it, fair enough.",1424851191

A concrete example: Should the touchmove event trigger the mousemove event? I believe it does in IE and Firefox, while it does not in Chrome and Safari. It isn&#x27;t specified anywhere, and can make it incredibly complex to implement something that works with both mouse and touch input. And it is exactly the type of thing that Pointer Events sets out to fix.<p>This is also exactly the same story as with the <meta name=&quot;viewport&quot;> tag. Apple did something, and the others made not-fully compatible copies. No exaggeration: Right now the only(!) thing that works consistently cross platform is setting width=device-width.

9105768,comment,9105604,9105709,0,0,smosher_,,,"> When the vast majority of mobile revenue is generated by iPhone users, that means if it doesn&#x27;t work on iOS, it doesn&#x27;t work at all - 80% marketshare be damned.<p>How does this matter to Google or the W3C exactly? I don&#x27;t buy this reasoning.<p>The CPU analogy doesn&#x27;t work either, since everyone depends on a number of different processors, with Intel approaching 100% representation among individuals—this doesn&#x27;t hold for iOS in the mobile market, where people typically depend on one phone.<p>That said, iOS might have stronger representation among the people who depend on mobile browsing than the market share numbers suggest (but that needs measuring.) My guess is that even as low as 20% of mobile is sufficiently significant to Google (whose employees all seem to have MBPs) and two major vendors is likewise to the standards committee.<p>> I&#x27;d imagine the best thing to do is commented on the article. Create a Polyfill, and if PointerEvents are better than the rest, developers will naturally use them. Eventually given the huge amount of developers on the polyfill Apple may be inclined to make it native.<p>Very yes.

The idea that some people will &quot;fit in&quot; and others won&#x27;t and that this can be determined during an interview is naive at best.<p>First, regarding the cultural fit: I think it&#x27;s important that you share a similar mindset with the people who already work there. You&#x27;ll get along better, and it is more productive. For example, if one person is much more assertive than another, and tends to get their way, we may miss out on the contributions of another. (A lot of very different examples here)<p>The second part: You&#x27;re right, they can&#x27;t give you a full personality quiz, but they&#x27;re doing their best (oral communication and body language tell a lot more than having you fill in a quiz). They want to look for someone who fits in, so they bring you in and see if you do. What other way is there?<p>> ... best actors ...<p>I think if you intend to be an actor for the sake of a job, you&#x27;re going to have a miserable time. Sure, I suppose this is the case if you value money more than satisfaction at you workplace. Which is where you&#x27;ll make friends and spend a lot of your life, so I think you shouldn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s subjective, so I concede this point.<p>> ... not fitting ...<p>This relates to the previous part in terms of priorities between just &quot;getting the job&quot; and &quot;being happy with your job&quot;. As for the idea of not fitting in, I think it&#x27;s too much of an exaggeration to think that people won&#x27;t tolerate a few things here and there--but if you&#x27;re entire view was different or fake to begin with, well maybe you didn&#x27;t belong after all... you wouldn&#x27;t be happy there anyway, so it&#x27;s for the best.",1424850597

Apple supported the defacto standard for handling touch input (<a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/</a>) before any other browser vendor, and Google followed them very quickly. The w3c decision to abandon touch events and pursue pointer events was only after Apple submitted to the w3c patent advisory group that they held patents on the standard (with no indication of requiring royalty -- and no indication of going after other browser vendors supporting touch events such as Google).<p>Furthermore, what is a pointer event going to do on an Apple or Google platform? Apple devices only support touch and mice as of this writing -- why do they need pointer events, which adds things such as stylus support with tilt? What would be the purpose of implementing that?

This is an intermediate skill because writing code is so hard that the speed at which you can type is irrelevant and can&#x27;t put much of a dent in the time it takes to write code, no matter how good you are. However, by the time you are an intermediate programmer you will probably spend a lot of time writing natural language to your colleagues and others. This is a fun test of your commitment; it takes dedicated time that is not much fun to learn something like that. Legend has it that when Michael Tiemann[2] was at MCC people would stand outside his door to listen to the hum generated by his keystrokes which were so rapid as to be indistinguishable.</i><p>I know that this piece wasn&#x27;t written that long ago (2003)...but thinking back on those days of programming, I believe that so much has changed in information availability and operating systems that while fast touch-typing is still just an intermediate benefit, being able to memorize shortcuts and execute them by touch is of <i>enormous</i> benefit.<p>What I mean is that while Google was good in 2003, now I can type in an error message and basically be assured that the relevant Stack Overflow question will come up. Or maybe not, so I pop up a couple of Google searches, tabbing between windows as I type in my query. As those load up, I Alt-tab to my terminal window to re-run the problematic command, or at least examine it for typos. By then, at least one of my Google queries will have finished, so I Alt-Tab to my browser, click one of the search results, then Alt-Tab to the other Google query, click on one of <i>its</i> results. By this point, the Google search results that I skimmed over, or perhaps from the OneBox/Direct Answer, has given me an idea to what my problem was. So while waiting for the actual pages linked from Google to load up, I alt-tab back into Terminal to see if any of those hints apply. If not, Alt-Tab to the browser, etc. etc.<p>Today I was teaching a student how to work with Twitter data from the command-line...and because Bash is not ideal for doing math or for parsing multi-line data...it took me a few tries of tabbing into a Bash reference manual, and many taps of the Up/History key, and Ctrl-A/Ctrl-E to navigate the prompt line, to come up with the command to calculate someone&#x27;s rate of Tweets (after hitting the API with a command-line program)...to the student, it must have looked like a constant stream of actual coding to get to the answer, when in fact, it was just a flurry of stupid mistakes and fixes in a span of a few seconds.<p>In the past, when a book was still often the best reference, or a very long webpage explanation...being able to quickly navigate the operating system may have not been such a big deal, as you were better served by just stopping your coding work to just read. Now (just as with all aspects of life and society), there seems to be a greater need to quickly navigate and filter information. I guess it&#x27;s a sort of multi-tasking...which may not always be ideal, but it is much <i>less</i> ideal if you&#x27;re multi-tasking and using your mouse to get around.",1424849704

Focus on getting your standard out and then call on Apple for failing to support it when the rest of the market supports it.</i><p>Unfortunately most standards don&#x27;t work this way. When standard bodies were left to their own devices, we got XHTML. Most standards seem to work like SPDY - one or two companies (Google, FB) use their market position to rollout a huge change to large number of clients and then make that the standard while everyone else cries about binary headers. In the PointerEvents case, the company with market position is Apple.<p>I&#x27;d imagine the best thing to do is commented on the article. Create a Polyfill, and if PointerEvents are better than the rest, developers will naturally use them.

What HBase calls a &quot;column&quot; is really more like part of a composite key, and nobody gets upset by a composite key that has millions of distinct values.<p>In an RDBMS, a table with millions of columns would be unmanageable for a bunch of reasons:<p>- If only a few columns were set in any given row, you&#x27;d waste a ton of space storing all the NULL values.<p>- Modifying one column in a row would probably require reading and re-writing the entire row.<p>- There&#x27;s no good way to retrieve a large-ish subset of columns that you&#x27;re interested in; you&#x27;d have to either specify them all by name in your query, or fetch the entire row.<p>None of those downsides apply to the Bigtable data model (which includes HBase, Cassandra and a few other similar projects). Null columns are free (since they don&#x27;t exist on disk in the first place), writes are cheap no matter the row size, and you can filter by columns in interesting ways.<p>You&#x27;re not wrong about the potential for messiness, though. The biggest drawback (IMO) of the Bigtable model is that the database server doesn&#x27;t know anything about the structure of your data. If you&#x27;re used to having a SQL prompt where you can examine and manipulate data in interesting ways, HBase&#x27;s &quot;shell&quot; is a huge step backward.

I know it is not the same analogy as the Pointer Event/Touch Event but still, it is possible.<p>> Too many times, we’ve seen browser vendors with the best intentions fall victim to Apple’s reluctance to work with standards bodies and WebKit’s dominance on mobile devices. We cannot let this continue to happen.<p>I totally agree but Apple&#x27;s not required to work with any standard bodies. Focus on getting your standard out and then call on Apple for failing to support it when the rest of the market supports it.

Also, since this isn&#x27;t under Docker Inc.&#x27;s umbrella people would be right to be cautious depending on it lest it die, whether that&#x27;s fair or not.<p>I don&#x27;t use CoreOS but I get it: it offers orchestration whistles that solve some people&#x27;s problems.

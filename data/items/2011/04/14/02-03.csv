It forces me to focus more on the content of individual posts, it's made me more careful with my own allocation of points, and--I know this this fuzzy and subjective--I think it's improved the quality of discourse. Which ultimately is the only metric that really matters here.<p>Maybe that's just a temporary thing; people change their behavior when they know they're being observed. But I'd urge you to keep it for a little while longer.<p>I like the idea of a more coarse-grained system, perhaps one that uses font weight or shades of grey to emphasize and de-emphasize certain areas of the conversation, weighted perhaps towards the dialog around a particular comment rather than the comment itself. Perhaps over time that would come to suffer from the same problems as the last system. But hiding the algorithm allows you to readjust it before people have the chance to reverse-engineer and game it. Numerical point systems are useful sometimes, but they tend to activate humans' incentive structures in some really negative ways.",1302749997

2445377,comment,2444619,2444619,8,0,latch,,,"When people talk of the demise of a company with billions in cash (and more billions coming in every year), they are generally talking about the demise of its <i>influence</i>.<p>The question isn't whether Microsoft will vanish next year (or even in a decade), because it won't. The question is <i>will Microsoft be a leader or a follower? An innovator or a copy-cat?</i><p>It isn't inconsistent to say that Microsoft will continue to sell a lot of copies of Windows and Office and remain very relevant in the enterprise, while at the same time saying that Microsoft, on its present course, is doomed (for lack of a better word). Because, the Microsoft that we know from the 80s and 90s just isn't the same Microsoft in a lot of ways that matter to geeks and investors.  Much like GM isn't the same car company it was a couple decades ago.<p>Things can always change. It's probably easier to claim the #1 spot or fall from the #1 spot, than to <i>reclaim</i> it, but it isn't impossible.<p>As for XBox's success, I remain highly skeptical of that division. First, they haven't recouped the billions it took to enter the market. Most importantly though, you are only as good as your current console. There's little loyalty in the video game console market. Had the PS3 been better priced and launched sooner, the red-ring would have been a far bigger disaster. It's cut throat...which is great, but you simply can't say Xbox 720 will succeed because Xbox 360 [barely] came in 2nd place in a 3 person race.",1302749969

2445361,comment,2444508,2444508,11,0,davidsiems,,,"I've actually done a fair amount of thinking (and even a little implementation) on this topic so I'll share my thoughts.<p>I've come to the conclusion that my ideal 'game programming' language would actually be 3 different languages that are tightly coupled. It would consist of the following:<p>- A low level language, similar to c/c++/d<p>- A scripting language that is tightly coupled with the low level language.<p>- A scripting preprocessor that's run as a preprocessor for the low level language (effectively replacing templates and the C preprocessor)<p>Low Level Language:<p>Games need to be fast, that's why they're written in C or C++. At the end of the day, when you're trying to squeeze those extra cycles out of your console, you need to be able to have precise control over how your data structures are arranged in memory, how things get copied around, what data is preloaded into the cache, etc.<p>It's okay for this language to be garbage collected, but the programmer needs to have full control over the garbage collector, ideally the garbage collector is of a variety that doesn't require stop-the-world collection. You'd probably also want manual memory management to be an option.<p>Scripting Language:<p>In game development, having a low-cost for iteration is also extremely important. If it takes your game designers 20 minutes to tweak something simple, the end product is likely not going to be very good. This is where scripting languages come in, you load all your resources (textures, models, etc) and then you iterate on the game logic without having to load everything from scratch. Loading can actually eat a very large portion of your development time if you don't have hot-reload or your game logic doesn't exist in script.<p>By tightly integrated I mean make the two languages intimately aware of each other's details. They each need to know how the other is storing data, it needs to be _simple_ (as in just a keyword simple) to call into and out of one from the other. This way the way they communicate can be fast, and a lot of the process can be automated by the compiler so you don't have to do it by hand.<p>A cool thing here would be having the ability to compile the scripting language to assembly or the low level language when it's time to lock things down for ship.<p>Scripting Preprocessor:<p>Embedding scripting languages into lower level languages can be a bit of a pain. In C++, you have a code generator do it, you use templates, or you do it by hand.<p>Templates are way too complicated for what they accomplish (code gen), the preprocessor is usually used in the same way (code gen). If you're not using these two methods to generate code you've probably written a code generator in an external scripting language that's parsing your C/C++ (yuck) and spitting out C/C++.<p>What we need is a preprocessor that is actually a scripting language in its own right. The scripting preprocessor gets run before the low level compiler, and just spits out code in the low level language. You have to jump through hoops to 'loop' or 'if' with templates, it's about time we gave ourselves a fully featured language to do our meta-programming in.",1302749685

After looking for a long time, I could only come up with one -- Zoho Challenge.  After working with that for about a year, its been nothing but headaches, broken functionality and customer service problems.  Fast forward to present.  I need a project to help me learn Rails (better late than never?).  So, I decided to build something I know I would use -- a better online test service.  I'm trying to build out the functionality I want to see in a form that others could use.<p>What it is (or will be):  A better version of Zoho Challenge, initially more oriented towards developers.  Or, perhaps a good description would be Wufoo for tests/quizzes/exams.  Basically, a service built to create, host, and integrate online tests easily into whatever you're doing so that you don't have to code something up yourself.<p>Link:  http://testist.com<p>Its a weekend project in which I was learning along the way, so its a little bare-bones.  Other than that, any thoughts?  Would you use it if it were more fully featured?  Etc..?

So next to the links there were a score for that link -- this way - while we could vote the post author either way, if multiple posts contain links in an answer to a question, the community can vote on the links themselves -- which will aid in people who are seeking the answer.<p>Additionally, if we have a contextual label selection for posts, then the community can select the label that applies from a list - and the readers would see which applies.<p>This removes the numerical karmic judgement from the post, but allows for insightful, helpful, informative, opinion or other classifiers to be used.<p>Would something along these lines work better for us?",1302747358

You don't ""learn"" to have teeth, do you?, Pinker asks.<p>How can this be, when we see so obviously that kids raised by Greek speakers learn Greek while those raised by English speakers learn English?<p>It's because, acc. to Chomsky and his followers (""Modern Linguists""), Greek and English are really the same language, and kids don't LEARN this language, called ""Universal Grammar,"" they GROW it. What they DO learn is the values of some ""parameters"" that cause different instantiations of UG to appear superficially different, like Greek and English.<p>This quickly required the definition of ""language"" to exclude every aspect of language except syntax, because everything else so obviously was learned and wasn't universal, and even with syntax, they ended up having to exclude the syntax actually used by real speakers really speaking. That syntax become known as ""performance"" as distinct from ""competence"", which was the universal language people really knew deep down inside but which got corrupted in real use by various noise-inducing factors.<p>So ""real language"" became syntax only, and then, only carefully constructed written examples of proper, uncorrupted ""competence"" syntax. And with those, all native speakers could use their innate rules plus parameter settings to unanimously agree on which word sequences were valid and which were invalid. You had a rule-based syntax with universal rules, right?<p>Except that, with each passing year, researchers outside the linguistics departments found more and more examples where native speakers disagreed over validity, and validity decisions that weren't discrete (clearly valid or clearly invalid) but were often shades of gray. (Inside linguistics departments, conformity to Chomskyism orthodoxy was usually enforced, as academia tends to do, so ""linguistics research"" has supported Chomsky for decades, while cognitive science hasn't.)<p>There were so many differences among native speakers of a single language, not to mention the ever-growing catalog of diversity between languages and the way that languages gradually diverge instead of in clearly discrete jumps, and so many shades of gray in judgments among natives that the notion of parameters got more and more ridiculous, even with the notion of ""language"" pared down to almost nothing.<p>Sure, you could claim that all books are the same universal book, too, as long as each character is a parameter. If so, then all languages are the same language under the surface, too, plus or minus some parameter settings.<p>Chomsky's ridiculous language ideas would have been thrown out long ago if he hadn't been such a leftist ""intellectual icon"" in the leftist temples of academia and media. Instead, his theory just changed dramatically from version to version but remained unquestionably true throughout. Every few years he would significantly revamp his ""program."" In 2002 he seemed to abandon everything about syntax, too, except for recursion. What's unique about human language, as opposed to the general principles found in all human (and some animal) cognition, is just the innate, universal ability to handle recursion in syntax. (That paper apparently infuriated Pinker by cutting his ""Language Instinct"" position down to just a syntactical recursion instinct.)<p>What a bunch of nonsense. And this paper is just one more nail in the coffin of ""modern linguistics"".",1302746995

Whereas I have one-liners that took me literally 5 seconds to come up with and ended up at 100+.<p>If I were to make an automated system for judging quality of message board content, it'd be a function of text readability (grammar/punctuation, avoidance of overly-long ""text wall"" paragraphs), size, and user feedback. A 500-word post with 7 upvotes is probably more awesome and more deserving of prominence than a 10-word one-liner with 125 upvotes.",1302746519

I HATE to hear this hog wash.<p>I have met many people from Caltech and MIT and the way you are saying it, it is like they are the distinguished elite... and yes maybe a select few are but don't generalize... they are really ditzy and honestly stupid people there. Structure, fear and the title of those prestige schools will keep you from doing something silly and failing out.<p>Last time I checked... Once you get in (from high school SAT / A-Levels / AP / CAPE) you are in for the full four years. So it is not the students. Scratch that.<p>So then what are you really saying the professors there will give me a better education than I will give to myself ? Ever heard of student cram sessions ? Students who study before class only to argue or sleep during ? I highly doubt a professor from another school will not provide a similar level of education other wise you are insulting them. So it is not the professors. Scratch that.<p>So is it their courses ?\nMIT has OCW, CalTech and Harvard I think have lectures on YouTube and elsewhere for the public viewing. So it is not the courses. Scratch that.<p>Stop giving credit where it doesn't exist.<p>And you missed what smanek is saying. This is someone who has either learnt material that would be covered in first year uni (which happens if you do AP or A-Level) or who is learning on his own. No one said that one will not learn jack shit when on the work force .. that is just stupid.<p></rant:driveby><p>Signed\nPissed off Canadian on behalf of \n-UFT\n-McGill\n-UofA",1302746426

10001386,comment,9996485,9999434,0,0,jd3,,,"Hello! I&#x27;ve been customizing my OS X installs since 10.5 with various programs (ThemePark, (S)artFiletool, and most recently Alex Zielenski&#x27;s ThemeEngine[0]). I&#x27;m a fan of the `platinum&#x27; theme from Mac OS 9, so I&#x27;ve been creating a system-wide OS-9 theme in my spare time this past ~year. I have .car files available for Yosemite and El-Capitain (the version I&#x27;m currently using). The Yosemite files are (mostly) true to the old OS 9 aesthetic, but I thought I&#x27;d change up the look of the traffic lights on el-capitain and release it at some point [1]. I have the source files for each different design I&#x27;ve done, along with the Assets.car (the replacement for the deprecated [and absent in 10.11] SArtFile.bin), SystemAppearance.car (change highlight colors in menubar and right-click menus/make window masks sharp instead of rounded [yes it also affects the GraphiteAppearance.car window masks]), and the GraphiteAppearance.car (used for the platinum traffic lights) files. At some point I will finish both of these and release them, but for now (I just finished my summer job working for one of my professors/I&#x27;m on vacation at the moment) the Yosemite theme remains slightly incomplete, and I&#x27;ve got some more testing to do on El-Capitain. Also gotta port that Yosemite-System-fontpatcher project to work with the new San Francisco (let&#x27;s not get that confused with susan kare&#x27;s 1984 `SanFrancisco&#x27;! [2]) typeface so I can finally get Charcoal/Chicago as my system font again like it was in Yosemite...<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/alexzielenski/ThemeEngine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alexzielenski/ThemeEngine</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/fpZemvX.gifv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/fpZemvX.gifv</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Q1tZknV.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/Q1tZknV.png</a>",1438657103

10001382,comment,9999121,9999121,0,0,caseysoftware,,,"I worked on the digital archiving project at the Library of Congress. In that case, it was mostly wire spool recordings, wax cylinders, and LPs, but many of the same principles apply:<p>-  This media can be fragile. Less so with VHS or Betamax, but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind.<p>-  It&#x27;s not usually just a single copy and drop it into an archive. Most of the time, they&#x27;ll want a super high quality, uncompressed master for long term preservation. This is with the hope that they never have to go back to the physical media.<p>-  Once they have that copy, they create lower quality versions for day to day display, usage, study, etc.<p>-  When you consider the &quot;work&quot; (in the artistic/archival sense, not the effort sense), it&#x27;s not just the video. Quite often they&#x27;ll want image scans of the media itself, container, etc. This is because the video itself may have been suffered damage due to physical damage.<p>-  Next, you need to document the whole process down to the brand and settings of every single device. If it&#x27;s known (or discovered later), that a particular piece of equipment distorts media (plays faster/slower, changes color palettes, etc), you need to know that and <i>potentially</i> correct for it at a later time.<p>-  And finally, don&#x27;t forget the metadata! A collection isn&#x27;t useful if someone doesn&#x27;t capture the who, what, and when. This is often the most painful part because the settings above are often set once and forgotten. This requires manually transcribing information written on the media, watching it, or a variety of other methods. Most libraries farm this out to interns. My new company - Clarify.io - hopes to help with this aspect.<p>If you&#x27;re interested more in the mechanics, please feel free to let me know.",1438656980

The problem is, people aren&#x27;t buying, whether all-electric or plug-in hybrid.<p>General Motors is struggling to sell 10,000 Chevy Volts this year, and Nissan has sold just over 8,000 Leafs. For context, about 13 million cars are expected to be sold in the U.S. in 2011...<p>The bad news is that the technology is currently at a point where they have to make trade-offs,&quot; Giffi says. &quot;So they want that same vehicle — they want it to look and feel the same. They also want it to perform the same.&quot;<p>Nobody is expecting those capabilities anytime soon.&quot;</i>[0]<p><i>Nobody</i> likes them, and for good reason.  Teslas are cool new-ish technology and the best of the lot, and yet the range is still too low, the charge time is too high, the infrastructure will take quite a while to develop, and they&#x27;re too expensive.  They are the playthings of the Silicon Valley rich, but not practical for the everyday person, whose main purpose for driving a car is cheap and reliable transportation.  Teslas and other electric cars are uncompetitive because they are too expensive for what you get, and the only way they become &quot;competitive&quot; is by artificially driving up the price of gasoline-powered cars and fossil fuels.  They get a subsidy because they are ostensibly &quot;saving the environment&quot;.  As I pointed out earlier, the mining of the materials to make these cars (especially batteries) is an extremely dirty and energy-intensive process, mostly done in China by diesel-powered machines.  Also, the cars are plugged into an electric grid which is run mostly on ancient fossil fuel plants[1] (as is most of CA&#x27;s infrastructure), as hydro and nuclear have become basically verboten or phased out of existence.  If being carbon neutral is the goal, driving your 20-year-old Accord <i>into the ground</i> would result in a fraction of the energy expenditure and emissions of having a brand-new car built.[2]  Or, actually, a horse and buggy would be the most carbon-neutral solution.<p>Californians may marginally start taking less fuel intensive options in terms of transportation, but most people want to live in suburbs where they have a some room to breathe in their backyard, the schools are better, and a car is necessary---higher prices will effectively force them to spend more on fuel (at the expense of other things).  The people in Marin County driving their Teslas and Priuses don&#x27;t really care, but the lower-middle and middle-class gets clobbered by high energy costs (and has been leaving the state in droves, for that reason and others).  And it isn&#x27;t necessarily because transportation is more expensive; energy costs affect the cost of heating and cooling your home, the price of farming and delivering your produce, the cost of your clothing and smartphone, etc.!  These sorts of regulations have led to the mass exodus of companies and jobs in manufacturing and heavy industry (which used to be the way many middle-class Californians made a living) to other states and other countries.  Let&#x27;s not forget that the least wealthy people are usually the least mobile as well.<p>Fossil fuels allow us to have an incredible standard of living.  What if food, fuel, clothing, and transportation costs doubled or tripled overnight?  This would certainly make the average person&#x27;s standard of living a lot worse.  And this is exactly what these foolish policies have accomplished and will continue to accomplish.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/11/21/142464818/can-electric-cars-help-automakers-reach-55-mpg\" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2011/11/21/142464818/can-electric-cars-he...</a>\n[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_California"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_Cali...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/17/car-scrap-energy-efficiency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/17/car-scrap...</a>",1438655401

There is a widespread public view across American society that a key structural change in the U.S. economy since the 1920s is the rise of middle-class wealth, in particular because of the development of pensions and the rise in home ownership rates. But our results show that while the share of wealth of the bottom 90 percent of families did gradually increase from 15 percent in the 1920s to a peak of 36 percent in the mid-1980, it then dramatically declined. By 2012, the bottom 90 percent collectively owns only 23 percent of total U.S. wealth, about as much as in 1940  (see Figure 2.)[0]<p>> The structure of the control network of transnational corporations affects global market competition and financial stability. So far, only small national samples were studied and there was no appropriate methodology to assess control globally. We present the first investigation of the architecture of the international ownership network, along with the computation of the control held by each global player. We find that transnational corporations form a giant bow-tie structure and that a large portion of control flows to a small tightly-knit core of financial institutions. This core can be seen as an economic “super-entity” that raises new important issues both for researchers and policy makers.[1]<p>[0] <a href=""http://equitablegrowth.org/research/exploding-wealth-inequality-united-states/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://equitablegrowth.org/research/exploding-wealth-inequal...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdf</a>",1438655293

But this is not a store.”<p>So now you’re giving them money, but you still aren’t a customer!<p>Because people are now using this as astro-turf marketing campaigns for products that are already funded by other investors, or as market research, or as a line item on their pitch deck to raise money from investors.<p>In this egregious case, the company seems to have had no intention of really entering into a “deal” with the backers of its kickstarter campaign, it was entering into a deal with its other investors, in accordance with a business plan its backers have never seen. Thus, they struggled to build DRM into the product, although DRM had nothing to do with the product they promised their backers, and everything to do with their other business dealings and plans. And now their backers are discarded like a one-night stand, but hey, here’s your own money back.<p>Frankly, this stinks.<p>If you go on Kickstarter and say you’re going to build product Y, that’s what you should do. If your business plan requires raising Kickstarter backing and then going after investors, you should say so up front and not pretend you are off to start work as soon as the project is funded.<p>And as for the investors, shame on you. If you invest in a company that has entered into an agreement with backers to build product Y, you should actually make them do that, or not invest in the first place.<p>Whatever pivot the go on to do, everyone has been forewarned that simply giving them money and receiving promises in return means very little to them, their attitude seems to be, “well, if we change our minds, we just give you your money back and do whatever we like.”<p>That is not a principled way to run a business.

In short, he largely claims to know what&#x27;s better for people than the market (i.e., themselves) while lamenting his loss of power and importance through moral rationalizations and judgment.<p>Facebook, Reddit and Twitter are vast improvements over a world where bloggers would seriously claim, &quot;I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted.&quot; Social media merely democratized and disseminated that power to the masses. No amount of rationalizations or FUD over a &quot;television-internet&quot; will reverse that positive trend. The elitist condescension that his links, comments or conversations are implicitly superior to the likes, shares or up-votes of the populace is more than a little sad, and I think he&#x27;s missing the point; social media thrives because it gives people more of what they want, and who is anyone to decide that but themselves?<p>That said, he makes a good few points with invalid conclusions, mostly regarding centralization. The loss of ownership over our own content has severe implications for the internet, most specifically in our ability to control its dissemination and protect it from loss and privacy. Protection from loss is easy with the rise of web-exposed storage APIs like Dropbox, and eventually I think we&#x27;ll see more and more cloud-storage-backed SaSS platforms, starting first in the enterprise and trickling down into the consumer market.<p>Regarding our ability to control our own data and the corresponding loss of privacy, it will take a lot longer, which is a real problem because the government treats the &quot;privacy&quot; of SaSS as a public square; You are entitled to none. We&#x27;ll probably need a technological or cultural innovation here. Culturally, people would need to revert, which is unlikely. Technologically, something like a content-owner controlled database would need to be developed, and upon maturity, laws passed to require its use. Such a database would enable the revoking of permissions to cause all reference entries to be removed, and disallow the denormalization of any personal data. That seems unlikely to happen anytime soon, so we&#x27;re consequently headed for some major cultural conflicts.<p>Lastly, the author scapegoats and disparages our focus on newness and popularity. First, humanity&#x27;s focus on newly discovered information has existed for some time: gossip, newspapers, magazines, tv, movie theaters, et. al. Every edition has only ever contained the newest information or opinions along with the occasional reprint. Second, popularity is but one vector for relevance, as were hyperlinks. Yes, a poorly implemented Stream that interprets likes as votes creates a false-feedback-loop, but it&#x27;s a widely known flaw, and exists primarily only in the nearly obsolete Facebook.<p>Once you clear away all the rationalizations he uses to justify why things were better when he was in power, you realize, it&#x27;s mostly just whining intermixed with a decent social commentary on and summary of the evolution of internet media.",1438654148

Perhaps some family member or a computing legend?<p>It was because I saw someone playing videogames in the computer at my mom&#x27;s job. He was a man, but in no way he was a role model. He could&#x27;ve been an alien and I still would only be fascinated about the computer. I didn&#x27;t care for the guy at all.<p>>Women also need women role models and those usually just don&#x27;t randomly appear - there is a certain critical mass that might have to be created with other methods, perhaps with encouragement from the so called &quot;allies&quot; the article mentions, although that might not be the best way to put it.<p>I fail to see why should I care.<p>>Young women have to look at it as a viable career option to work in computing, and for that to happen they need someone to pave the way.<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions. This is what you say. What you really want is special treatment for women in computing e.g. quotas, grants and internships.<p>I do not care for any of that. The way I see those things do more harm than good.",1438653864

The trick, if running on Debian, is:<p>1) use system python -- if you can. Now with python3.4 and 2.7 in stable, that&#x27;s the easy bit.<p>2) If you can&#x27;t do 1), use backports and/or manually backport[1]<p>3) If you need python-packages that depend on c-libraries, use &quot;apt-get build-dep python-foo&quot;.<p>4) use a virtualenv, or several virtualenvs, eg:<p><pre><code>  virtualenv -p python2.7 myvenv\n  ./myvenv/bin/pip list -o #list outdated packages,\n   # typically that&#x27;ll mean you first need to:\n  ./myvenv/bin/pip install -U pip #possibly also setuptools\n</code></pre>\nThen install the packages you need with pip -- see 3) for tip on stuff like pyqt that needs some (fairly hairy) packages.<p>This works for most everything -- except perhaps for pygame, which is exceptionally gnarly.<p>[1] Manually backport, the easy way:<p><pre><code>  sudo -s\n  echo &quot;deb-src http://httpredir.debian.org/debian\\n   sid main contrib non-free&quot; \\n   >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sid-src.list\n  apt-get update\n  cd /tmp\n  apt-get build-dep python3\n  exit # No need to build as root\n  apt-get source python3 # this assumes sid has a version\n   # that&#x27;ll work for you\n  cd python3*\n  dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us\n  cd ..\n  sudo dpkg -i python...deb\n</code></pre>\nNote, this may or may not work with major packages like python -- but it often goes a long way. If you can&#x27;t get enough build-deps satisfied, things are more complicated -- and you&#x27;re <i>probably</i> better off running testing/unstable in a chroot, possible with help of the schroot package -- rather than fighting with conflicting packages.",1438653737

If we are selecting a &quot;random point in a square&quot;, everybody&#x27;s intuition agrees that this means selecting the x coordinate and the y coordinate from a flat distribution.<p>In a similar manner, a chord can by described by a point and a direction.<p>– The first (1/2) method selects a point from a flat distribution along x-axis, and defines that the direction is always vertical. (Edit: this is how I interpreted the animated gif, but Wikipedia says that actually from a flat distribution along a random radius, and then the direction is perpendicular to the radius.)<p>– The second (1/3) method selects a point from a flat distribution on the perimeter, and then actually selects another point also from the same distribution, to define the direction by connecting these points.<p>– The third (1/4) method selects a point from a flat distribution on the circle area, and the defines that the direction is always perpendicular to the radius.<p>The whole point of the paradox is to demonstrate that there is no single universally agreed upon way to define a flat distribution for the set of all chords. And when we start to try to define one, by breaking the definition of a cord into components, and sampling these components from a flat distribution (or just selecting one direction, because symmetry says they are all equal), we get different results depending on how we broke the concept of cord into components.",1438653704
10001222,comment,9997918,10000583,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"There are at least two major classes of people using Python.<p>On the one hand, there are people who write, distribute and deploy Unix-y-type software -- system utilities, web applications, service daemons, etc. These users write for users who are like themselves, or who are sysadmins of Unix-y systems. Their concern is with automatable, repeatable, command-line-friendly packaging, distribution and deployment. They benefit from wheels because it saves them a potentially-time-consuming build step during installation, and will generally prefer wheels or tarballs as a distribution format.<p>On the other hand, there are people who use Python as a scientific computing and number-crunching stack. Many of them do not write and distribute their own applications; they distribute the results of their code. Many of them run on desktop-type machines using Windows. What they primarily want is a single .exe they can download and run which will provide Python plus all the numeric/scientific libraries in one install, plus (increasingly) IPython Notebook as a way to share their work.<p>There is no single standard which works well for both of these groups.",1438653681
10001221,comment,9994246,9998517,0,0,eropple,,,"It&#x27;s interesting that you say all that--because none of that rings true to me. Quite literally none of it. Even the idea of understanding types is foreign to me, because I only think of types as collections of messages that objects respond to and use them only as shorthand for exactly that; like, my yardocs are full of [#to_sym] as a &quot;type&quot; instead. Things like `extend` are trivial to me, and I can explain both their semantic behavior and their implementation in three sentences. I find Ruby fairly consistent and its libraries no more difficult than .NET--and seeing as how because of plenty of bad decisions you can&#x27;t really trust IntelliSense in the first place (like, say, arrays implementing IList<T> but throwing an exception for Add()), I find myself Googling no less for the documentation in .NET. And <i>much, much less</i> than in Scala, though I am very comfortable in that, too.<p>I&#x27;m curious, though. When you say &quot;Ruby&quot;, how much of that was outside of Rails? I don&#x27;t intend that as an ad-hominem, but rather in the exploration of a theory that I&#x27;ve had for a while. I am wondering if the approach one takes to learning the language and the ecosystem influences how much &quot;magic&quot; there is to Ruby. What you describe sounds familiar from friends and colleagues who learned <i>Rails</i>, and Ruby incidental to it. I only vaguely know Rails at all, I don&#x27;t use Ruby for web applications beyond a Sinatra server as a dumb API.<p>(And, as I said, RubyMine has a stop-the-world, click-around debugger, much like Visual Studio. I&#x27;ve only used it once or twice, because the REPL is comfortable to me, but it does exist.)",1438653661

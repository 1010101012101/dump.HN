    --------|------|------|-----
     pearls |      |      |  
    --------|------|------|-----

    --------|------|------|-----
            |      |      | 100
</code></pre>
We know that 40% of the eggs are blue, so we fill in 40 at the bottom row in the blue column. We now also know that 60% are red. Similarly, 20% of eggs are empty & red, so we fill in 20 there. Now we can calculate that 60% - 20% = 40% are pearls & red:<p><pre><code>            | blue |  red |
    --------|------|------|-----
     pearls |      |  40  |  
    --------|------|------|-----
     empty  |      |  20  |
    --------|------|------|-----
            |  40  |  60  | 100
</code></pre>
Now comes the final bit of data: 5/13 of the eggs containing pearls are painted blue:<p><pre><code>            | blue |  red |
    --------|------|------|-----
     pearls |  X   |  40  | 40+X
    --------|------|------|-----
     empty  |      |  20  | 
    --------|------|------|-----
            |  40  |  60  | 100
</code></pre>
With X = 5/13*(40+X), or X = 100/3.<p><pre><code>            | blue  |  red |
    --------|-------|------|-----
     pearls | 100/3 |  40  | 220/3
    --------|-------|------|-----
     empty  |  20/3 |  20  | 80/3
    --------|-------|------|-----
            |  40   |  60  | 100
</code></pre>
Now we can answer the question: what is the probability that an egg painted blue contains a pearl? For every 40 blue eggs, 100/3 contain pearls. So the answer is 100/3/40 = 5/6.",1298928369

An engineering school starts with terminology, overviews (survey classes), and specialization options. Learning to think takes both an institution willing to teach it and a student willing to learn it.<p>However, it seems that a number of people, possibly more than half, under-estimate the value of learning how to motivate yourself to finish things in the presence of losing interest in doing so. Lots of people ""get"" the joke that the last 10% of a project takes 90% of the effort but they don't get the fact that folks who never learned how to motivate themselves through the finish (of which having a college degree is a reasonable signal) will 'drop out' at the 90% point at best, and become dead weight at worst.<p>Combine that with the unemployment statistics of folks with versus those without college degrees and statistically it seems you want to be in the 'with' group.<p>The bottom line is that college is the first place you get to show the world your work ethic and your 'mettle.' That's because for many its the first place where not-going is considered a legitimate option.<p>You can be very successful without finishing college, see Bill Gates or Steve Jobs as examples, just like you can get into the National Football League or Major League Baseball by going to open tryouts.

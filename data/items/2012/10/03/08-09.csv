It's not well known, and its fairly new so I don't blame ya.<p>Here's how it works: (1) make changes to styles as you do (2) you can click through to the Sources pane and live-edit styles there, just like a text editor.  (3) Right click and save to disk. choose where to save the file (4) Make some more changes (5) Just hit ctrl-s (or cmd-s) to immediately save back to disk in the same location.<p>I just made a screencast to show this in action: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy5obNItQiQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy5obNItQiQ</a>",1349254760
4606512,comment,4606025,4606439,5,0,mrb,,,"Crypto weaknesses are always possible. But generally speaking, widely-deployed algorithm like SHA256, ECDSA, etc (which Bitcoin relies on) don't become suddenly broken one morning. Research progresses slowly (eg. weaknesses found in round-reduced versions of these algorithms), giving ample time to the community to plan for an upgrade when it becomes clear that one of the algorithms will become broken soon.<p>Bitcoin is also very conservatively designed. For example an address is computed with a RIPEMD160 hash of a SHA256 hash, so one would have to break both algorithms with preimage attacks to be able to generate address collisions allowing an attacker to steal coins from an arbitrary address. Because of this conservative design, it gives it a ""safety cushion"" to have time to anticipate cryptographic changes if they are needed.",1349254751

This is why we test shit :-)<p>(Also - unrelated to this - is that the ""login"" bit is often not where the biggest win for third-part auth is. It's in reducing friction in registration. I've seen high single digit percentage improvements in abandonment of registration for some B2C sites due to getting profile info from twitter/linkedin/etc. cutting the time it takes to setup accounts fully. Lifetime value also increased since profile info was generally better from those sources which was an important part of users getting value out of the system, and so the business getting value out of those users).<p>[edit: also - they seem to be looking at total numbers, rather than doing any kind of cohort analysis on the folk using twitter/facebook/whatever... which may well lead to different conclusions]",1349254517

4606491,comment,4604555,4604991,5,0,Daniel_b,,,"I completely disagree with your views about Drupal development. We've recently migrated bmj.com (a big site with gets 1.6 million visitors and 6.8 million page views a month) from old Java Servlet based platform to Drupal. We've used continuous development process where up to 4 developers were working on the same code base in dev, staging/testing and prod environments. It is now a standard Drupal development practice to export all configuration data to the source code. BMJ.com is not a simple site, it has an article page with quite complex data structure with up to 60 meta data elements (author details, publication date, vol/issue number, section, series, category, taxonomy, relations to other articles, open access flag, etc...) being rendered at the relevant blocks.

In this position you are the market but you are also the IPO underwriter for each stock. You should pick a certain level of stock, it can all be equal, say 1,000,000 shares for every company and use a limited supply strategy to sell stock in all 50k companies over a certain period of time, say 30 days. This would seed your market.<p>The in-demand stocks will rise quickly with the limited supply strategy and lesser demanded stocks will drop to be penny stocks. It'll probably be 80/20 where 80% are worth pennies.<p>Once you have offloaded your entire inventory now you just allow others to trade between themselves and you are done. The market will correct your approximations in short order.<p>If you are looking for a pricing engine to handle the limited supply strategy, send me an email.

This is a very important problem for a very small amount of people, but it makes great headlines.  Do you think the US government is genuinely interested in resolving this properly from an engineering perspective?<p>2. that 100% ""drive by wire"" systems should not be allowed...there should be a big red ""holy shit"" kill switch on the dash of modern cars that kills power to everything except steering and brakes<p>So, imho, its a very serious problem, that affects very few people (in the big scheme of things), and there is a very simple solution, for going forward technology at least, if not existing models.  But do you guys get the feeling that this is what the conversation is actually about?  Something seems a bit odd to me.<p>But then I'm one of those conspiracy theorists that think when you're running 15% budget deficits and have real (as measured using historical methods) unemployment of 20%, and many bond issues are taken down 50% by the federal reserve (literally printing money to buy your own debt), that you will start to observe unusual things happening in the marketplace.  The adherents of Occam's Razor would imply that that I am simply crazy, becasue the simplest answer is <i></i>always<i></i> the correct answer.  So I guess thats it.",1267865909

1171333,comment,1169467,1169467,0,0,sailormoon,,,"I love a good freedom of speech rant as much as anyone else, but I think the reaction here is completely overblown. The idea is not, of course, to remove posters from inside walls of people's homes. It is to remove advertising on the outside of those homes, and presumably the only reason the police would go inside is to effect the removal of that advertising upon the owner's refusal or absence.<p>Advertising on houses and buildings is not a matter of free speech; it is a matter of neighbourhood amenity and dominated by local by-laws. I am not allowed to put huge advertising posters on my balcony right now, of course. To do so would enrich me while depriving my neighbours, be an eyesore, push down property values, etc. I can't play super loud music at 3am, either, which doesn't really seem like a breach of my right to free speech either.<p>My guess is that the planning committee in London thinks that during the Olympics certain people might consider the fines they get for illegal advertising insufficient to deter the act, so they're temporarily allowing the cops to tear them down, and if that requires property access, fine. Probably accompanied by a temporary regulation adjusting the aforementioned advertising controls.<p>Free speech? Give me a break. Either you consider all anti-eyesore visual appearance regulations to be ""against free speech"", or you are probably able to concede that a temporary upgrade of enforcement is pretty reasonable considering the stakes.",1267865313

It doesn't have tail call optimization. It has mutable array operations, but immutable string operations (got it backwards.) There are no macros, hygienic or otherwise.<p>The only thing it has in common with Scheme are first-class functions. If you want anything else, you must implement it yourself out of the Turing Tarpit, and it will perform badly, because optimizing JavaScript is difficult due to its mistaken specification.<p>By any of these metrics, Python, Ruby, Perl, and C# all have more in common with Scheme than JavaScript.

I used to own a V-8 Ford pickup; if you happened to hit the brakes and the gas at the same time the power of the engine would completely overwhelm the brakes and the truck would (start to or continue to) move.

Coming from a state where many people own pickup trucks, I was taught that the engine will overpower the brakes, every time.

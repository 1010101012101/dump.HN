14903,comment,14860,14860,0,0,waleedka,,,"I'm assuming that by ""having your own blog"" you mean a link blog on which you submit links to stories you find interesting in your area of interest (as opposed to writing your own posts) and others can read it just like they read reddit or digg. In that case, I'd say that a social news site is better because it won't stop when you're on vacation or not feeling like posting. However, for a very small domain for which there is not a big enough community, a link blog is the next best thing. ",1177033370

Very much an older school type of place though.  Three-tier, web servicess, Oracle, the whole nine yards.\n",1177033334

At least it will always feel easier and safer. <p>VC's almost unanimously claim that they like what they do because they get to be involved in helping entrepreneurs succeed. I don't doubt that to be true. They could be more helpful with a bit of effort put into providing true, honest feedback to entrepreneurs. ",1177031643

I think hope is harder to rely on, but it's better in the end. Fear tends to become negative in many ways. <p>I think all entrepreneurs exist with both motivations constantly in flux. ",1177031351

How well does the long sales letter format translate to the app store?",1298995143

Call and ask for Bill.  Mention what you wrote above.  He will take good care of you.<p>You may want to try one or two residential rental investments and see if you prefer residential or commercial.  It really does depend on your strengths and having a trustworthy network of people (handymen, estimators, inspectors, plumbers, electricians, etc).<p>Rent out your commercial unit ASAP.  Get some revenue, at least to offset the taxes.  Collect first month's, last month's, and a security deposit equal to the month's rent for your commercial property.<p>When a commercial tenant breaks the lease, you may be responsible for removing any materials and heavy equipment the previous tenant has left.  This takes time and money and you cannot rent the space again until it is taken care of.<p>You may want to reconsider a personal office and use a home office instead.  There may be better tax benefits to that situation, while generating additional rental revenue for your newly vacant office. Build a new detached home-office/garage.<p>You also have enough money to buy enough solar panels to never have an electrical bill (provided your house is not too large).  There are many tax incentives for this, too.  Not paying for electricity seems like part of a good strategy to beat inflation.  This may also work for your commercial properties.<p>Congrats on your success.",1298995138

Magic Johnson is a <i>huge</i> investor in these for this reason (and has a line of theaters)<p>Generally speaking, diversification is very very important.<p>Even though bonds, stocks, or other items might be doing poorly at the moment, diversification protects against a precipitous loss. So get some of each sort of security, some real estate, some counter cyclical stock (aka invest in companies that do fine in down markets). Make sure you get very comfy with your insurance agents as well: Liability and Errors and Omission insurance are very important now, as you're a target. Make sure you're properly covered on all your properties and that you use limited liability mechanisms with all your business ventures. Be very careful you understand what actions as a board member/fiduciary officer are not covered by the policies.<p>Additionally, keep more than you'd think is useful in a cash/near cash account. Opportunities arise quickly. The ability to write a 200k check this afternoon can make you many times your 5m sometimes.<p>A very serious aside:<p>At the same time, be <i>very</i> careful of deals with ??? in the plan, especially with people related to illegal drugs.

So I just answered about pricing on a comment below, but here's the gist of it:<p>We charge per day to give you the flexibility of the cloud. Cloud9 is not an IDE alone, it's your tooling + test environment in the Cloud. So it's hosted, hosting costs money and we charge you for it. The idea is that if you are doing a commercial project with a good hourly rate, then paying 50 cents a day for the platform isn't a lot if it saves you significant time. If you're working on an open source project, Cloud9 is free.<p>The value is that you don't have to configure your systems, you dont have to keep them up to date and you'll be developing on a system that is identical to your deployment target. We're adding good deployment support soon to many different cloud hosters. This way deployment should be really a click of a button. Then there is the value of collaboration. Being able to work together with others from within Cloud9, editing and running code.<p>We are adding Ruby support soon, including step through debugging and gem support. We have webdav support and we'll soon support mounting your drive on your local machine for external applications to access your files.<p>For now, try Cloud9 for your open source projects and see how you like it.

One of the advantages of cloud services is that you have flexibility, so with the pay per day we offer the flexibility to only pay for the use of the platform when you need it. Our thought is that if you're doing a project that makes you a couple of hundred dollars a day, 50 cents for the editor is not much if it saves you a lot of time.<p>With that said, we still have some way to go before all the time savers we have planned are in Cloud9.

2275743,comment,2275657,2275657,0,0,kunley,,,"Excellent article.<p>My take is that what kills Lisp is a common allergy towards anything related to so-called release management. The Lisp technology helps with it - it encourages staying within an image and putting all new stuff there. The problem is, it can and often does create an attitude ""it works in my image and I don't care, you should know how to put it together by yourself or maybe you're not skilled enough"". Well, it partly true. But the proponents of such elitist view tend to forget that today's software is so interdependent and relying on moving parts each of different quality, that actually we don't have the luxury of having ""works for me"" attitude. Even a genius can bang his head against stupid obstactes. It's not intelligent (and counter-hackish) to repeat the same mistakes again, or allow others to do that.<p>We as a civilisation invented cool things like semantic versioning, encapsulation, TDD & BDD. Please, Lispers, do follow this movement. Some people like creator od Quicklisp do a tremendous work in the area of release management, but are they a majority?<p>Sharing is part of creating. Making something shareable counts as well. Not being able to share makes people bitter, because we're social animals after all..",1298993608

2275711,comment,2275354,2275354,0,0,mdasen,,,"Not to sound cheap, but the first thing I note is the pricing.  It's a little confusing.  Does 33 cents per day mean that I'm only charged on days that I use it?  So, if I use it Monday - Friday, I'll typically pay 7 Euros per month rather than 10 Euros?  Or is it merely saying that it's only 33 cents per day?  I'm also unsure what you mean by a workspace.  In the UI photos, there's the concept of a ""project"", but I'm unsure if I would need multiple workspaces.<p>Then there's the cost itself.  If 33 cents per day translates into $166.73 per year (after the conversion to USD), that seems a little expensive.  The reason I say that isn't to say that software must be gratis, but that RubyMine's commercial license is only $149 and includes all upgrades for a year and you can upgrade your subscription after that point for just $99 per year.  Personal licenses cost even less.<p>I'm not saying you don't have a great product - it looks absolutely gorgeous.  I'm merely asking what the value is here.  Is it that I don't have to install my IDE on multiple computers I might use?  Is it that it will support multiple languages at the one low price (while JetBrains has different products for different languages)?  Is it planned that it will support, say, running and debugging my Rails project without me having to configure environments on different machines?<p>I'm seriously asking because I do work on multiple machines (of different OSs), but I need to be able to run and debug (in my case Rails) projects and things like Eclipse, TextMate and a terminal, or even gedit with its terminal plugin will allow me to browse my file hierarchy, get an edit space with syntax highlighting, and run my application.  Plus, while it can be annoying to set up another box, that doesn't happen very often and it means that things like relying on gems works.<p>It looks wonderful and I hope you keep improving it!",1298993181

I am having a hard time finding good RE brokers who can find other properties for me (they all send me the same MLS listings, no private deals) and my investment broker is only able to provide me with 4-5% return, my own portfolio of 300k is doing better then his and I am new at this. So I am wondering, what practical advice anyone can give me so I can safely invest this money to beat inflation and live off of this for the rest of my life. Should I invest more of it into stocks? Should I buy a strip mall? or a strip club? :P I need practical advice investing, most stocks I have looked into for blue chip companies yield around 3%? and I would not want to put all of my money into stocks to make $150k a year off of $5m, with 1% being inflation and being taxed on that.

Although using the likes of elance or even mechanical turk, it is much easier to find cheaper labour for certain tasks.<p>* Hardware is a lot cheaper/faster.  Strangely - due to the bloated & broken nature of things like Boost, compile times have stayed strangely constant! More importantly, the likes of VPS significantly improve the cash flow. A server to host your first website is now $10 a month with no contract. Ten years ago - you'd be locked into long contracts or buying a machine. You want twenty servers to stress test something, or test software on 8 different Linux versions, fire up some EC2 instances. There simple wasn't the equivalent back then.<p>* The development time to build most systems has got a lot less. The availability of libraries, cloud-services, APIs & virtual machines has drastically reduced the time taken to build certain types of systems.  E.g. with something like Tropo you can quickly build fairly advanced telephony services. With AWS, you have access to huge computing resources should you need it. Web frameworks have significantly reduced the time to do CRUD-like tasks.<p>* The quality of FOSS is far higher now than it was then. Particularly the libraries and development tools.  The quality of community sites (e.g. StackOverflow) also helps a lot in terms of access to development knowledge.<p>* Most markets are more mature now in terms of what is a minimum viable product. E.g. to build a web business now - it prob needs to be more polished then ten years ago.<p>* The Internet market place is a lot bigger. E.g. there are a lot more Internet users, app-buyers. Ten years ago - a business like AirBnB wold probably have not had enough users gain critical mass.<p>* The ease of reaching customers is easier.  Things like Apple's App store (or even Facebook) makes it pretty easy to reach buyers, receive customer payments etc. Similarly the likes of twitter and viral/social marketing to all certain types of product to get a lot of cheap exposure.<p>* The ability to develop web based applications as opposed to desktop applications does significantly reduce development costs.  Not that developing for IE6 isn't a pain, but it's a damn site easier than having to develop and support lots of different desktop operating systems and legacy versions.",1298991794

That being said we currently don't have the scale to leverage our data consumption to decrease costs through peering etc. For now $1/Gb places us one of the cheaper providers for bandwith in Australia.

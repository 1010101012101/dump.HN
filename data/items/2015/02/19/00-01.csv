9071868,comment,9070110,9070110,0,0,jasonjei,,,"Definitely HN newsworthy, especially since YC has backed coffee startups.<p>I personally think Philz is going to give third-wave coffee a run for their money. Definitely as approachable as Starbucks and easily replicable. The problem with third-wave is that the total applicable clientele for a company like Blue Bottle is far and few between. Even after saturating every corner of SF, NYC, LA, Chicago, it&#x27;s going to be hard for BB to come up with hundreds of millions of revenue and retain quality (Blue Bottle raised $100M in cash). Blue Bottle has a &quot;luxury good&quot; perception.<p>Philz is unpretentious, reliable, and love in a 600-calorie cup of coffee, cream, and sugar. It&#x27;s a formula that so far has proven to work in America. Third-wave coffee is excellent, but isn&#x27;t as accessible as Starbucks. Philz, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t attempt to sell the virtues of high-brow single-origin coffee. They, however, make a really good cup of coffee, and reliably do at each location.  I definitely believe it is repeatable even at scale because many Philz drinks rely on mint leaves, cream, and sugar--flavors that are the &quot;MSG&quot; of coffee.<p>User experience is inclusive and welcoming--although some locations are more fun than others (visit the 24th if you haven&#x27;t and it will become abundantly clear why there are Philz phanatics). I love coffee shops like Four Barrel, the Mill, Saint Frank&#x27;s--but those shops exude refinement and appear a little out of reach, even if priced similarly to Starbucks. I would hypothesize you could put a Philz in the Midwest and it would do well.<p>As of right now, every coffee shop compared to Starbucks pales in comparison.  Starbucks boasts $70B in market cap.  If anyone has a good shot of picking a fight with Starbucks, it just might be Philz.",1424307178

This could be fairly easy to build, but seemed that it would lean way too much towards non-music, providing too much of a simple translation, instead of a metaphor. We wanted a system that would allow us to say: “If you’re a good pianist, then you’ll be a good gamer”. ... Simply put, we had to find a way to translate what a good pianist would play into what a good gamer would play.</i><p>This talk then continues much later:<p><i>To tackle this situation, we decided to adopt a clear and strict separation of concerns, in which our firmware would be conceptual center of command:</i><p>* <i>the single role of the piano is to play notes (key hits)</i> * <i>the single role of the console is to play controls (button hits)</i> * <i>the role of the pianette, our firmware, is to receive notes from the piano, somehow turn them into controls, and send these controls to the console</i><p><i>That became the basis for a refactor of the whole firmware.</i><p>A one-to-one mapping from piano keys to controller buttons would be interesting, but not... satisfying.

9071815,comment,9070496,9071697,0,0,pavlov,,,"It&#x27;s true that OS X uses OpenGL for GUI compositing, but that&#x27;s only the lowest level. Above, there&#x27;s a very important piece of the GUI stack called Core Animation which provides layer compositing.<p>Core Animation is used by both the native GUI as well as the browser DOM. When you use layer-backed compositing on a web page (e.g. CSS 3D transforms), WebKit implements it with a Core Animation layer. So DOM-based rendering enjoys the same benefits of GPU-accelerated compositing as native apps -- although obviously with rather different semantics since HTML+CSS doesn&#x27;t map directly to Core Animation.<p>If you implement your own GUI framework on top of WebGL or Canvas, you&#x27;re not getting Core Animation compositing for free, so you need to replicate that functionality in your custom framework. (This applies equally to native apps: a WebGL app is equivalent to a Cocoa app that renders everything into a single OpenGL view, and a HTML Canvas app is equivalent to using a single CoreGraphics view.)<p>I don&#x27;t think the WebGL/Canvas route makes sense for most apps other than games and highly visual 3D apps. You&#x27;ll just spend a huge amount of time building your own implementations of all high-level functionality that is already provided by the OS and/or the browser: layer compositing, text layout, view autosizing, and so on.

Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance (i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits).

I had internships but I imagine people would be fine with previous work as well.<p>I don&#x27;t have the slightest idea about whether being an indie developer would make you a lot of money, but my guess would be no. Having a full time job gives you a lot of stability, and as far as I can tell most indie developers do not make much money, in fact I think most barely manage to scrape a living.<p>Interesting and difficult projects are much more interesting on a resume than a degree, unless it&#x27;s from a top college, in which case it really depends on the school and project.<p>However, I&quot;ll tell you that I actually did go to college, I just didn&#x27;t finish, and if I could I would totally go back. Financially it makes complete sense to not go to college if you don&#x27;t have to in order to find a job, but the thing is, the things you&#x27;ll learn and do in college is likely going to be much more interesting than the work you&#x27;ll do in industry.<p>If you are in a position where you already know most of the things that are taught, I would STILL recommend you go to college. In fact, you&#x27;re in an even better position to take advantage of college because that means you should be able to take graduate courses instead or do research.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s just my experience!

9071739,comment,9069846,9069846,0,0,otakucode,,,"I think it is very, very difficult to comprehend some things.  Like the absence of something which has been ubiquitous in your life.  The intellectual idea isn&#x27;t hard to grasp, and you can even deduce other consequences from the idea, but gaining a visceral (for lack of a better word.. maybe intuitive?) understanding is far more difficult.  I came to this belief when I was a teenager and had just gotten into watching foreign films.  I watched a film called Hour of the Wolf by Ingmar Bergman.  I was watching Bergman films because I expected (from pop culture references) them to be crazy, abstract, unpredictable, and impossible to grasp.  They&#x27;re really nothing like that, of course, but I mention it so you&#x27;ll understand my mindset.<p>Instead of being treated to lingering shots of cigarettes, portraits of tired old women, and eggs breaking on chickens, I was actually treated with some insight.  It was entirely unexpected, and I imagine that it was not even intentional on the part of Bergman (though if it was, bravo to him!), but I had a very profound realization of what life must have been like before the introduction of electric lights.  The main character can&#x27;t sleep, and huddles around the light of a candle - a positively claustrophobic little area.  Now, I had been in circumstances of dark before.  I was a Boy Scout and had been away from ubiquitous lighting before.  But it was always with the knowledge that I could reach for a flashlight or lantern.  I never had to consider that without those things, if I were afraid of what might lie in the dark, I would be forced to simply endure it and wait for dawn - hours away!<p>I am sure that I only tasted an inkling of what the subjective experience of people in that situation is.  But that experience sticks with me decades later.  It helped me realize that simply &#x27;knowing&#x27; something intellectually can still starve one of the full picture.  It helped me realize how profoundly different a life can be with only small changes to environment.  It also was one of the big things (along with the humor in The Seventh Seal which doubled me over and which I did not expect) that drove me to become an avid fan of film.  The supra-lingual things that a skillfully made film can communicate never cease to amaze me.",1424304716

I wonder how sensitive this technique could be for arrhythmia detection, since many arrhythmias are inherently irregular. The potential for measuring cardiac output is already awesome, though, as it&#x27;s useful for diagnosis of heart disease.",1424304268

You just said either yes or no, and they&#x27;ve figured out the apparently right amount for the general populace (which is a little sweet for me but not as sweet as you&#x27;d expect from a donut shop).<p>They figured that replacing the station with all the add-ins was a faster and better experience for customer and employee. Can&#x27;t disagree, since I went to Dunkin for the convenience. I don&#x27;t know how big the market is for coffee with personal attention (the taste snobs seem to just make their own), but perhaps Philz is laying down the tracks for all sorts of motherly-service-as-a-product to bank the SF zeitgeist.<p>Hey, whatever happened to that grilled cheese startup?",1424304033
9071699,comment,9069634,9071195,0,0,whoopdedo,,,"> On iOS there&#x27;s more of a tendency to sprinkle buttons anywhere on the screen<p>Has it always been this way? iOS has been around longer than Windows Phone and more people have created apps for it. I believe there is a tendency to &quot;interface drift&quot; where when a new design pattern is introduced many developers will race to imitate it. (Consider how Material Design is popping up everywhere, even in places unrelated to Android.) But at some point an app will break from the norm. Either because the UI doesn&#x27;t fit what they want, or it&#x27;s a new idea that&#x27;s an improvement over the standard, or just for the sake of being different. That opens a floodgate as developers no longer consider the base UI to be a rule and more of a loose suggestion. (i.e. After years of everyone using the 3D controls of Windows 95, WinAmp introduced skinning and after that all apps had to be skinnable.) Eventually users complain about the confusing mess of interfaces, so the OS reigns everyone in by rebuild the system UI with the best of the new ideas since the previous version. Developers applaud the new universal design and flock to emulate it in their apps. Thus the cycle repeats.<p>So is Windows Phone more uniform in its interface because it&#x27;s designed to be that way? Or is it just not old enough to have drifted away from the standard UI?",1424304001

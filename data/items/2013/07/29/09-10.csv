6120121,comment,6116514,6118095,3,0,artagnon,,,"You&#x27;re not going to notice any lags if you use Emacs to work on toy projects. Try a non-trivial operation on a repository of respectable size, like linux.git: if you don&#x27;t classify those operations as being &quot;completely unusable&quot;, you&#x27;re living in the dark ages.<p>Incorrect. Several proprietary IDEs use real parsers. Which is precisely why they&#x27;re able to provide all sorts of magic functionality like &quot;refactor&quot;.  And no, regular expressions don&#x27;t &quot;work well&quot; by a stretch: even the common modes like shell-script-mode, perl-mode (cperl-mode is slightly better), python-mode are riddled with bugs. If you look at the relatively new js2-mode, you&#x27;ll notice that the parser is an Elisp port of the Rhino parser. Also, Semantic Bovinator from the CEDET project was recently merged into emacs, although it doesn&#x27;t have major users yet.  Precisely because regular expressions aren&#x27;t &quot;good enough&quot;.<p>The reason everything is implemented in Emacs Lisp is because there is no alternative: Elisp doesn&#x27;t have an FFI to speak of. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t see the problem with using existing parsers; unless your &quot;point&quot; is to take everyone back to the dark ages.<p>No matter how you look at it, there are more alternatives to Vim/Emacs than there were 30 years ago. A lot of people are happy with TextMate, Coda, Visual Studio, Eclipse. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s something special about the year 2013, but what I meant is: Emacs will become extinct, and that is inevitable. And yes, I&#x27;m <i>hoping</i> for some kind of programmable editor to take its place soon.",1375091964

6120101,comment,6119673,6119673,9,0,tenfingers,,,"I&#x27;d like to point out that the price difference is most likely to do with the marked conditions of the health care in general, and has nothing to do with the quality of the operation itself.<p>There is a big problem with health care in most countries that I&#x27;ve been living into for extended periods of time (France, Italy and to a lesser extent Germany).<p>Anything sorrounding &quot;medical&quot; and/or &quot;health care&quot; has a 10x-100x price blowup, for absolutely no reason. I&#x27;m not even speaking about surgery, I can start by phisiotherapy consumables, such as elastic bands. Elastic bands are used in phisical rehab. They are dirt cheap, usually, if you buy them inside a child play store. But behold, if you buy the <i>same</i> stuff from &quot;Thera Band&quot;, which is officially sold to hospitals and clinics, a couple of meters of the stuff will cost you 20-30 times more. I worked as an assistant in a phisical rehab clinic for several years, and this kind of bullshit is <i>amazing</i>, because it goes for <i>everything</i> (air balls, plastic rods for balancing excercises, and so on). The price inflation goes even higher with actual machines.<p>There is a machine which is called &quot;Rehab 3xxxx&quot; (produced by a clinic around here which I helped develop, so I won&#x27;t disclose the details), which is just a linear actuator which moves <i>back and forth</i>. Literally, nothing more. There is an embedded controller which allows to tune the extension limits, and a couple of ABS plastic accessories that hold to the knee, wrist, etc.<p>The idea is just to move the articulation, and/or rotate it, over and over. You would think that there is something &quot;fancy&quot; about it, to name a few details which I <i>wished</i> this machine had:<p>* force feedback to stop the motion (right now the machine will just twist your arm as configured, no matter the force)\n* speed regulation (who needs it? just one speed is good enough)\n* some sort of patient-id so that you don&#x27;t need to reconfigure it each time<p>But not really. Like I said, this is just a dumb linear actuator, with incredibly cheap ABS plastic accessories and a fancy name. Price? 30k euros in the basic kit.<p>The funny part: for anything medical, you have to demonstrate that this machine is effective somehow. So we had a trial in an hospital, wrote an article about the effectiveness (or lack thereof) and did some paperwork. The idea is that you just have to demonstrate that it doesn&#x27;t <i>hurt</i>. Of course, a physiotherapist will be twice as effective, but it&#x27;s more expensive on an hourly basis, so that&#x27;s why clinics love to buy the machine and just let patients sit on it.<p>I&#x27;m literally disgusted, but I can see everything around &quot;medical&quot; equipment having the same issues. All the economy surrounding hospitals, doctors and equipment is essentially broken, because there&#x27;s essentially no competition, assured money (by the state in this case) and a lot of corruption going on within the clinics and medical companies (unfortunately).<p>edit: english.",1375091443

6120089,comment,6119834,6119834,4,0,dspillett,,,"Unfortunately it is very common. The approach a lot of companies are taking to telephone agents not knowing user&#x27;s passwords is to ask for only three letters of them - the agent on the phone needs to type these in to have them verified - and this is not possible if the password is stored after processing with a salted hash.<p><i>The reason this is done is that it reduces reply attacks which is a significant concern for over-the-phone authentication. Using the three-characters-from-your-password method someone listening in to your call won&#x27;t be able to call back and authenticate as you unless they have listened in to enough calls to piece together the whole password.</i><p>The usual method is to store the passwords in a strong but symmetric encoding which is no more secure than plain text if an attacker can get both the stored passwords and the key(s). the risk can be mitigated (though not completely removed) by making sure the keys are never stored anywhere near where the passwords are stored, but at some point in the process the key and the encoded password must meet for at least a brief moment.<p><i>Essentially this becomes a problem of weighing one risk against another: is the potential loss of security if the account data store is compromised justifiable when considered against the likelihood of successful replay attacks if you must hand over the whole password each time?</i><p>One suggestion I&#x27;ve seen is to store (salted and hashed) each combination of three characters without any external indication of which combination each hash represents (so for abcdefghi you would store encodings of 01a02b03c, 01a02b04d, and so on, meaning 720 stored hashes for that ten character password). That way you can check any combination by checking that the resulting hash value exists in the set. This is probably not a good solution though: if an attacker gets hold of the hashes then if they also know the salt they only need 46,656 attempts to derive the content of each hash (assuming a mix of numbers and single case letters is required) so 33.6 million checks would guarantee revealing a 10 character password instead of 3.6 thousand million million - reducing the processing requited by a factor of 100 million. I say &quot;probably not a good solution&quot; as I&#x27;ve done no analysis of this complexity compared to the relative non-safety of passwords stored in a reversible encoding - though I assume the fact I&#x27;ve not seen any such analysis from a trusted source either indicates that it isn&#x27;t a solution relevant experts feel should be taken seriously.",1375091081

What filters through to the American public is a seriously distorted version of the evidence available, emphasizing alleged Khmer Rouge atrocities and downplaying or ignoring the crucial U.S. role, direct and indirect, in the torment that Cambodia has suffered. Evidence that focuses on the American role, like the Hildebrand and Porter volume, is ignored, not on the basis of truthfulness or scholarship but because the message is unpalatable.&quot;<p>And on the veracity of reports about horrific slaughter made by Cambodian refugees: &quot;Refugees are frightened and defenseless, at the mercy of alien forces. They naturally tend to report what they believe their interlocuters wish to hear. While these reports must be considered seriously, care and caution are necessary. Specifically, refugees questioned by Westerners or Thais have a vested interest in reporting atrocities on the part of Cambodian revolutionaries, an obvious fact that no serious reporter will fail to take into account.&quot;<p>Did Chomsky show poor judgement by discounting such refugee reports?

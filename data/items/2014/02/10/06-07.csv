So although your statement is technically true (it would reach 50% after 5 years) these are not necessarily &quot;failures&quot;, just closures, and many businesses last 20 years or more. I started 1 business in 1992; have had 3 others that I closed after 6 months, 2 years, and 6 years respectively. 2 were unprofitable, 2 were highly profitable. How does that skew the figures?<p>Entrepreneurship has never been a young person&#x27;s game until recently. Older people have more cash and fewer liabilities - children have left home and mortgages are paid off - so have more financial flexibility.<p>Investing 12K from savings is no big deal when you are older and actually have saving to invest.

And this is just what i know about and can remember.<p>However we have also increased bus service in general, built a new rapid transit line from DT to the airport (canada line), are now extending the skytrain to the tri cities and hopefully soon after down the broadway corridor to UBC.<p>DT Vancouver isn&#x27;t building more roads, but theres not exactly room for any new ones.

7209555,comment,7206637,7208957,3,0,scoofy,,,"> A bus is a bus.<p>No, just no.<p>> because I might miss the last one.<p>We are talking about cities. There should not be a last bus. They should run 24 hours/day.<p>> now I have to get taxi to grocery shop on the weekends<p>In a real city, you can usually walk or at the very least, cycle to your grocery store. If you can&#x27;t then you do not actually live in an urban environment.<p>> public transportation is often used by those that cannot drive, that unfortunately includes crazy people.<p>Right, again i&#x27;m talking about creating a system of urbanism in major cities. I&#x27;m not talking about Houston or San Diego. I&#x27;m talking about cities like Amsterdam, Edinburgh, or Stockholm. If taking a bus is slower than taking your car at rush hour, you&#x27;d have to be crazy to take the bus. If you build a good BRT system that is faster than using a car, people will use it. Not just crazy people.<p>>Why would they ever vote for that? Why would a small quiet suburb of some major city just decide to vote to punish themselves for driving?<p>We are talking about cities like Philly, and people that live in cities like Philly, we are not talking about some exurb that uses subsidized parking in major cities to facilitate their commute.<p>Why would they vote for that? Easy, because it pits competing interests together so that there is no major bloc that forces a candidate to change. Let&#x27;s say you add a sin tax. Those that can afford it would benefit, because there would be less traffic on the road, and those who don&#x27;t own cars would benefit because it would improve the public transit infrastructure. The slowly increasing it while slowly increasing the public infrastructure would never force a major bloc into political action. Something that definitely would happen if you dramatically reduce the quality of living for 1/6 to 1/4 of a city&#x27;s population by trying to dramatically ramp up some type of subway system and digging up people&#x27;s front lawn for 18 months, so that they can have access to a subway in 6 years.",1392015408

7209550,comment,7205759,7209326,2,0,mikeash,,,"Thanks for the info. I was familiar with most of that, but didn&#x27;t think the difference would be so big. How much of a &quot;safety factor&quot; are we talking about between the ability to handle normal audio and the ability to handle this sort of catastrophic case? In other words, how much would you have to turn down the maximum volume limit? Is it a factor of 2, or 10, or 100...?<p>If it&#x27;s a factor of 2, for example, just take the 3dB volume loss and move on.<p>I don&#x27;t see why detecting the situation is so hard, though. Build a simplistic model of the amount of energy dumped into the speaker and the amount dissipated, run the audio through that model, and then limit the volume when the amount still in the speaker gets too high. This would let through small amounts and limit large amounts, just like you&#x27;d want. For a really simplistic model, run the signal through a high pass filter, integrate the output, then apply a running average to that. When the running average surpasses a value that indicates the speaker is reaching its limit, cut the volume. I take it that this doesn&#x27;t work?",1392015327
7209549,comment,7207348,7207348,2,0,ergoproxy,,,"Chris Hedges took the red pill, and Agent Smith told him, &quot;I&#x27;d like to share a revelation that I&#x27;ve had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I&#x27;ve realized that you are not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment. But you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague.&quot;<p><i>The Matrix</i> would have been a better allegory to use than <i>Moby Dick</i>, particularly for HNers. <i>Moby Dick</i> might appeal to Harvard-educated, Arabic-speaking, Vermont liberals like Hedges, but most of us haven&#x27;t read it and don&#x27;t want to.<p>It&#x27;s not that I disagree with any of Hedges&#x27; major points, it&#x27;s just that I find his presentation erudite, pretentious and snobbish.<p>Economist Kenneth Boulding summed this up more concisely: &quot;Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.&quot;<p>And if Capitalism is a &quot;plague,&quot; what is the cure? Hedges talks about Marxist revolution, but stops short of calling for one, instead falling back on quotations from Shakespeare, and Kant, and Dante, and Black Elk, and Nazim Hikmet.<p>So, what is the cure?<p>1. War and revolutions aren&#x27;t the answer: If they decimate the population, temporarily reducing resource consumption, decreasing the supply of labor so that wages might finally start rising again after 30 years of stagnation, then what? After all the misery and suffering that war brings, we&#x27;ve bought ourselves a few decades with a slightly more equitable wealth distribution, and put ecological disaster in check for a while, but it&#x27;s only temporary, and our populations will soon grow themselves back into the same problems all over again.<p>2. Technology? Increased efficiency will only spur increased consumption. It&#x27;s called Jevons paradox. Technology will only speed things up.<p>3. Accelerationism... Help the capitalists steal all the wealth and push us over the edge of ecological disaster. Evolution will make sure something else succeeds us.<p>4. Enlightenment: In the <i>Gospel of Thomas</i>, Saying 56, Jesus said, &quot;Whoever has become acquainted with the world has found a corpse, and the world is not worthy of the one who has found the corpse.&quot;<p>The world is already dead, and there&#x27;s nothing Chris Hedges can do about it! Whenever something we love dies, we experience mourning. The stages of mourning are--<p>Denial - Most of the people in the world are stuck in this stage.<p>Anger - This is where we find revolutionary groups like the Tea Party and OWS.<p>Bargaining - I think this is where Hedges finds himself. He really thinks there&#x27;s a way to resurrect the planet--Art, Poetry, Novels--but he doesn&#x27;t seem sure.<p>Depression - Lot&#x27;s of people struggling at this stage. About 800,000 to a million people commit suicide per year.<p>Acceptance - Doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re ever going to be happy again. It just means you&#x27;re awake to reality.",1392015273

And also to why selection sort might actually be really, really slow.<p>I also think that coding and computer science are so tightly connected that in practice you can&#x27;t do one without the other even if you wanted to. I also think there&#x27;s no easy path to coding: you need to start from the lowest level and build from there. Or start a bit above the lowest level but go for a dive down later, and only then continue upward.",1392014370

That would destroy Europe, affecting a hell of a lot of politics. None of the people who think like this live in the cities. Well either they live in the very expensive neighbourhoods, the &quot;reserved&quot; neighbourhoods (e.g. the EU commission &quot;reserves&quot; certain houses/apartments only for it&#x27;s employees), or the countryside (which is more like suburbs than like countryside).<p>On the other hand, there are also people who actually live there. They wouldn&#x27;t mind the population dropping and the violence, exclusion and crime matters a whole lot more if you can&#x27;t escape it. Walking around the north station in Brussels with an iPad, for example, is impossible. Walking around alone if you&#x27;re female, just don&#x27;t risk it.<p>And of course, the racism charge is used against anyone who isn&#x27;t happy. Note that racism, by itself, is a crime in Western Europe (this started out as a law against holocaust denial and now includes a hell of a lot more[1]). It&#x27;s considered part of criminal law, which means that if you&#x27;re suspected of racism you can be charged without any damages. This tends to happen to people who get in the way of the status-quo politics. In reality 35-45% of the population is extremely against immigration (including nearly all non-recent immigrants), but they&#x27;re kept out of the political process through charges of racism or accusations of being nazis.<p>[1] Except of course, where convenient.

Even if the child winds up providing 50% of the value of an average person, it can still be a net gain.<p>Economic reasoning is just one (minor) aspect to this situation though. There is very real value in simply helping a fellow human survive.<p>> as a premature baby with massive expensive health problems, wouldn&#x27;t we expect the opposite?<p>The stats you cite are for extreme cases on the edge of viability and the odds still slightly favor normal or near-normal development.<p>This particular baby was born with a 66% chance of living and deserves more than a quick dismissal.<p>> If babies could be born months premature with no negative effects, why aren&#x27;t they being born that way already so they can start growing up quicker?<p>That&#x27;s horrible reasoning.

We&#x27;re working on approximating this optimal machine with artificial machines and continue to rapidly make progress.

It was not &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Google enforces policies in a consistent manner and, in the unlikely event you are caught up in a heuristic, you will be able to talk to someone and resolve the issue in a timely fashion.&quot;</i><p>I think this is changing and Google is wising up. In fact, the screenshot of Google&#x27;s support documentation that I provide in the article isn&#x27;t the same page I saw when I was suspended. The page I saw just said:<p>&quot;If you have received an Advertising Policy violation we will no longer accept advertising from you&quot;.<p>I think that this is a function of 2 things:<p>1) Clicks are more expensive, and losing individual advertisers affects Google more now than it used to. You can see the strategy clearly: shut down fake SEO link building, drive people onto AdWords, increase CPC, improve support.<p>2) They&#x27;re targeting a lot of non-tech-savvy type small businesses now who are far more likely to &quot;bluster their way through&quot; than to sit down and carefully analyse Google&#x27;s terms of service, so they are being far more lenient.<p>The funny thing is, that since Google is becoming more lenient in reinstating suspended accounts now, a bunch of companies have sprung up saying &quot;WE&#x27;LL HELP YOU GET BACK ON GOOGLE!!1&quot; but that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s so much easier to do than it used to be anyway :)",1392013156

What happens in the second swap? Well, the second position contains 1 with probability 1/n, and 2 with probability (n-1)/n. With probability 1/n, this position that is highly biased towards 2 (for n > 2) will get swapped with the first position. So 2 is more likely to be found in the first position.<p>Of course, it gets messy to carry this out for the n swaps and I still haven&#x27;t really answered your question yet. To do that let&#x27;s make the following assumption: after the ith swap, the distribution of numbers at position i is uniform. (I think you can prove this inductively but I haven&#x27;t tried working it out - I was studying for a midterm before I got nerd-sniped.)<p>Before the ith swap, position i is biased towards number i. By our assumption, position i-1 is uniform. By making position i uniform we are essentially &quot;smoothing out&quot; the bias at position i to the other positions. Hence, as in the example I started with, it is more likely after swap i that position i-1 will contain number i, at the expense of the other numbers. This then reduces the likelihood of finding number k in positions 1, 2, etc. as opposed to position k-1: 2 is more likely in 1, 3 is more likely in 2, and so on.",1392013067

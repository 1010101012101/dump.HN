There are two sets of people I know: Folks of the kind that you mentioned who are incredibly good programmers but who have other interests outside life. In fact one of the smartest coworkers I knew spent half his time at work and the other half time in a band and he was extremely productive. Another group are the people who have a personality which doesn't exude visible signals for passion: They probably never hang out at meetup groups or conferences, but they quietly hack away in their own time without tweeting about it or whatever. From a macro perspective they are ""passionate"" for sure but are susceptible to false negatives especially in the highly noisy interview setup.",1340211599

Stop drinking warm coke.<p>Fine, then don't claim something like ""All cokes in all contexts at all temperatures are better than all pepsis in all contexts at all temperatures.""<p>This is equivalent to what the study does with static vs. dynamic. Your argument, if you actually had a point, would be something along the lines of, ""wait I'm talking about this boutique hand-crafted cola (Haskell) I get at Whole Foods, not that old Coke (Java), that's 20 years out of date!""<p>You're trying to retro-actively reduce the scope of a study you didn't write. The conclusions clearly use generic language that brings <i>all</i> static typed languages into a comparison with <i>all</i> dynamic languages. The false equivalence is <i>not mine</i>!

But you don't need either.<p>><i>""aren't irrelevant simply because they don't add unique functionality.""</i><p>I never said they were irrelevant.  I <i>own</i> one.<p>The article tries to blame Android's failings in the tablet space on their lack of ability to get it together.  I believe, based on personal experience, the real problem is that tablets themselves just aren't that great.  Sure, the iPad is incredibly successful.  However, let's not underestimate Apple's rabid fans, incredible marketing or that fact that they were the first to build a fantastically futuristic device.  But it's not really providing me with anything I don't already have.  That's usually what I base my consumption on.<p>Someone else in the thread said something along these lines:  people are buying ""iPads"", because they are cool and there is some status tied to them.

The UEFI spec doesn't explicitly disallow making Secure Boot a toggle-able option, so some OEMs (like Dell: <a href=""http://www.osnews.com/story/25293/Dell_HP_Respond_to_Secure_Boot_Issue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osnews.com/story/25293/Dell_HP_Respond_to_Secure_...</a>) are planning to ship with it on but let you turn it off in the BIOS options if you want to. So someone technically knowledgeable could switch it off in your laptops before you hand them out to students.<p>Still two big ""ifs"" there, though:<p>1) You can turn it off <i>if</i> the OEM gives you the option to, and OEMs are under no obligation to do so; and<p>2) All of the above is only true for x86 machines; for ARM-based systems, Microsoft is <i>requiring</i> that no option be provided for the user to disable Secure Boot (see <a href=""http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2012/01/is-microsoft-blocking-linux-booting-on-arm-based-hardware/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2012/01/is-...</a>).<p>So the upshot is that <i>if</i> your hardware comes from a cooperative OEM, and <i>if</i> it runs on x86, the impact on you will be minimal -- just flipping a switch. But ARM systems and systems from uncooperative OEMs will be locked, so you won't be able to assume that any laptop that comes in over the transom will be useful to you anymore. (ARM laptops are uncommon today, but after Windows RT launches they may become more common.)<p>EDIT: Looks like since the last time I looked at this issue MS made it mandatory for OEMs to allow users to be able to turn off Secure Boot on x86, see comments below.

Once a programming language or framework is established, it can be difficult to get a job without direct experience.  There's a short, narrow window of opportunity when a technology first appears where nobody has much experience and people can learn on the job, and that's the magic moment to gain experience.  Queue the stampede.  For instance, when EJB hit, a lot of Java devs thought that if they didn't gain experience with this new technology quickly, they'd be shut out.  And I did start to see job postings that specifically required EJB experience, not just general java experience.<p>I get the feeling that the industry has moved away somewhat from this type of skills matching, but hacker news can give you a distorted view on how things work.  Lack of experience with a specific technology is less likely to hurt you here than with a consulting/body shop attempting to put square pegs in square holes.  But even this article recommends that you gain deep experience in a technology and avoid becoming a ""jack of all trades"" (while at the same time advising against being a fanboy for a specific technology).  This isn't necessarily inconsistent - there is a meaningful difference between being a fanboy to the exclusion of all else and being an expert with depth in a particular technology, but it can be a tight line to walk.",1340210525

He was super excited and thought it could revolutionize the way research funding works.<p>It won't. I'm sorry, but it just won't. There are several reasons why a kickstarter for academic/scientific research is doomed:<p>1) People underestimate the amount of money required to fund research. Starting this Fall, I'll be receiving a grant from the NSF for one year of funding. That funding pays me approx. $1800/mo, plus covers my health insurance ($800/mo), tuition ($5k/semester), and travel ($7000/yr). The university also provides me with facilities and access to faculty and thus have overhead that need to be covered. This grant is shared among 3 PhD students and totals over $180,000.<p>2) Progress does not happen in leaps and bounds, it happens in inches. Kickstarter projects go from conception or prototype to finished product. Research does not work that way. You go from previous algorithm to slightly updated algorithm. It's a marathon, not a sprint to production.<p>3) You get nothing. Kickstarter projects give you a cool gadget or game or piece of art or whatever. When you fund a Kickstarter project, you get to see a video of some prototype or sketches that look like they'll be awesome. By the end of it, it's finished and you have this cool new thing that you can enjoy. You will not get any cool new thing from researchers, because they don't even know what it is they're trying to make yet. At best they will produce a conference or journal paper, maybe with a neat little demo of low production quality, and then they're on to the next problem. Scientists are not interested in building production-ready toys, they are searching purely for knowledge. So you as the funder get nothing tangible.<p>4) Most science is boring to the average person. Researchers live on the edge of human knowledge. They are tackling problems for which there is no known answer. Odds are, if you're in a sexy area like neuroscience, robotics, etc., then the problems you want to solve have been looked at for decades by people much smarter than you. Thus, you are not going to make some gigantic breakthrough that leads to strong AI-- you're hopefully going to develop a new learning algorithm that performs 3% better than the state of the art on a handful of benchmark datasets. Exciting, right?<p>Overall, it'd be great if we had democratized funding that worked. Unfortunately, due to the costly, slow, intangible, esoteric nature of scientific research, it's unlikely that will happen. Most academics have a hard enough time convincing experts, who have dedicated their lives to the area, that their work is worth funding. I just don't see how it could possibly work.",1340210201

It also has control over 110kg of material - putting its weight in the 2000kg range (minus the track).<p>There are safety systems available, but none that are commercialized that will allow humans and robots like this to exist in incredibly close proximity with any expectation of safety.  Some of the recent research we completed at Carnegie Mellon points to a future where this is possible: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Xc4yq-rz0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Xc4yq-rz0</a><p>But we're not there yet.",1340210089

Let's look at the key statement in the conclusion of the study:<p>""Based on these results, the conclusion can be reached that while unit testing can detect some type errors, in practice it is an inadequate replacement for static type checking.""<p>As I've already pointed out, this seems to me an ambitious and over-reaching conclusion, given the scope of the study.<p>But, equally important, it is simply an <i>example</i> of something that was already provable. It should be axiomatic that <i>in principle</i> automatically-generated validation like that provided by static typing should <i>in theory</i> be able to catch type errors not caught manually in a dynamic context, either for reasons of human oversight or human error.<p>In other words, it seems to me that all that has been done here, is to provide a few concrete examples of what was already true and uncontroversial: auto-generated coverage of specific types of validations <i>can be</i> more comprehensive than <i>some</i> human beings will be in <i>some environments and contexts</i>. It has not shown that the perceived benefits of dynamic typing with good unit tests are outweighed by this fact, nor that, statistically-speaking, errors of this type are common enough to warrant a preference of static typing over dynamic typing with unit tests in all contexts.",1340209652

Learning a language opens many doors, and I don't really see German being end-of-lifed any time soon.<p>Perhaps every university doesn't need a research oceanography unit, but it sure would be nice if they provided at least a teaching unit or two on those.

Read what you quoted, it says nothing even remotely resembling ""this benefit applies to all languages with static typing"".  It is testing static typing, not a specific language.  It uses the best static typing system to do so.  You are entirely inventing the notion that this must then apply to java.<p>> If the study was meant to comprehend such a broad category as 'static type systems,' and from the explicit language of the study, it clearly was, then absolutely Java must necessarily be included<p>No it mustn't.  Comparing the best of dynamic vs the best of static is a useful test.  Just as nobody is complaining they didn't use a worse language than python, it makes no sense to complain they didn't use a worse language than haskell.  You don't draw conclusions about the potential of X by examining the worst example of X possible.",1340208188

Then why did you offer it as an example of how static typing doesn't help.<p>Of course you can make sure you never actually run the bad query with dynamic typing.  I assumed it was obvious when talking about static typing that the difference would be compile time vs run time.  With a statically typed language, when you make the error, you get told about it by the compiler.  With a dynamically typed language, you find out about the error later, when that code actually runs.",1340208005

As long as your willing to follow the regulations (which exist to prevent mis-selling, market abuse, insider trading, and other such things) getting SEC approval isn't that hard.<p>The other alternative is to partner with a regulated firm and use their approval, this it the route Zopa has taken.

(You yourself said you enjoy discovering new kinds of humor, and kinds of humor implies underlying patterns.) I believe that it is possible to discover these underlying patterns, and then make a determination as to whether a statement falls into one of these patterns or not. This can be done independently of whether or not a person exists who can see that the statement falls into one of these patterns.</i><p>Okay, then. That makes sense. I don't know if from that you would be able to quantify humor like you mentioned before, but yes: there is rhyme and reason to it.<p><i>Anything that violates our expectancy is interesting in an objective sense. And things that violate expectancy do generally hold our attention. But not always. The reason being that insightful writing is even more compelling than writing that is merely interesting, so it tends to steal our attention away.</i><p>I still don't agree with that - I think that there's more to ""insight and interest"" than just declaring objective tags to things. I have easily learned more from reading fiction than I have from reading nonfiction. But I see where you're coming from.<p>Now I have to go and upvote this whole discussion.

378038,comment,377487,378010,0,0,bretthoerner,,,"> ""Solaris is better than Linux.""<p>That's a very blunt statement of fact.<p>Yes, DTrace is great.  ZFS has a lot of greatness if you overlook the bugs production systems have had (see: Joyent) to fix still (systems down for a week while they hand-fixed the FS - Yeah, fun stuff).  Zones are cool, but has its drawbacks (and advantages) when compared to something like Xen.<p>> ""A lot of it is even installed by default; it just isn't in the default PATH.""<p>Uh, you know that when people talk about ""Linux"" they really mean ""common GNU/Linux distributions such as Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/RHEL"", right?  You realize they mean more than gmake and gfind and gcc, right?  Sorry, Solaris has absolutely nothing like the apt repositories available on Ubuntu (I know they're working on this, but that is still the not-so-stable-or-bug-free OpenSolaris, and it still isn't anywhere close, and we're talking about today, right?).  Can I pull down svn, git, mercurial, bzr in a simple command?  How about lighttpd, nginx, haproxy?  What about a recent vim and emacs?  Recent memcached, python/perl/ruby client for it?  Those are all basic and well known, that isn't even the hard stuff.  What about something a little more specific?  PostGIS, GDAL, Proj?  I can grab all of those on Ubuntu in a few seconds.<p>And of those you can compile from source yourself on Solaris, you'll find many a quirk because the project maintainers tend to run either a flavor of Linux or FreeBSD.<p>Yeah, Solaris is ""better than Linux on servers"", and my time isn't worth anything.",1227732423

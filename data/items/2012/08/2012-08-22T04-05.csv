4416098,comment,4415799,4416048,17,0,jandrewrogers,,,"C++ is increasingly used for high-performance and massively parallel systems. While I used to work on systems primarily written in Java (large-scale analytics and databases) everything new is being done in C++, especially any kind of high-end compute environments. C++ has a few very real advantages on modern architectures and when tackling modern problems. With C++11, it is also a pretty decent programming language in terms of expressiveness.<p>C++ has two big advantages over alternatives like Java: very low and deterministic processing latency (important for real-time) and very efficient memory model (important for throughput). These are really both about memory, and C++ gives you detailed control in a way few other languages do. As to why this is important, memory performance has been scaling more slowly than many other aspects of computing architecture such that it is <i>the</i> bottleneck for a growing number of applications. C++ allows you to be very efficient with the memory architecture without much effort. If your application is fundamentally bound by memory performance, competent C++ can get you 2-10x returns on performance in real systems relative to languages like Java. (For some other tight-loop, CPU-bound codes, not so much.)<p>I'm pretty bull-ish on C++11. It is not so much that I am a fan of the language but that I am a fan of what it can do in terms of performance for databases and large-scale systems. Most of the high-scale and high-performance development going forward seems to be targeted at C++ these days. That was not always the case but the requirements of modern applications are somewhat forcing that choice.",1345611139

However it's not a scalable business. If I got 100x more sales next month, I would need more people and the number of people needed would most likely be a linear function of the number of sales I got. Also, it's not a completely reliable business model in the long run.<p>Compare that with that of Wix.com, which is a DIY website builder software. I would bet that they know that for every X free users, they'll generate $y in add-on sales. If they got 100x more users/customers, they would need more people and resources but likely it would be an logarithmic function.<p>Now if you had a ""startup"" like Wix without a clear focus on figuring out how to generate revenue, that's just foolish. That wouldn't be a startup. That would be wishful thinking.<p>Basically what I'm saying is that it wouldn't be fair to say that my business that consistently generates $x/month is better than a ""startup"" that might generate 1/10 of the revenue each month <i>IF</i> they are deliberately trying and succeeding at figuring out an effective, scalable & reliable business model because in year Z, they could be 10x my revenues.",1345610725

Saying Knights Corner was available on November 2011 is also deceptive; Intel demo'd it at SC11, but you can't buy one yet.<p>Second, he helpfully glosses over that Cilk++'s elemental functions are identical to how CUDA and ISPC work; write a specially decorated single-threaded function, use a specially decorated function call, and end up with parallel work. I think it's exceedingly likely that the industry will standardize on this as the data-parallel methodology of choice within the next ten years. That timeframe will depend on how quickly GPUs and CPUs converge in terms of functionality (with vastly different performance characteristics). Task-parallel stuff will be done with something else.<p>The really difficult question will be how to get performance portability. C++ (or Fortran) code that runs well on Haswell will probably run like crap on KNC and vice-versa due to differences in the number of threads you need in flight, cache sizes, vast latency differences, etc. (Look at OpenCL running on two GPUs or especially CPU vs GPU as an example today.)

4416065,comment,4411536,4412886,0,0,sintaks,,,"Former S3 employee here. I was on my way out of the company just after the storage engineering work was completed, before they had finalized the API design and pricing structure, so my POV may be slightly out of date, but I will say this: they're out to replace tape. No more custom build-outs with temperature-controlled rooms of tapes and robots and costly tech support.<p>If you're not an Iron Mountain customer, this product probably isn't for you. It wasn't built to back up your family photos and music collection.<p>Regarding other questions about transfer rates - using something like AWS Import/Export will have a limited impact. While the link between your device and the service will be much fatter, the reason Glacier is so cheap is because of the custom hardware. They've optimized for low-power, low-speed, which will lead to increased cost savings due to both energy savings and increased drive life. I'm not sure how much detail I can go into, but I will say that they've contracted a major hardware manufacturer to create custom low-RPM (and therefore low-power) hard drives that can programmatically be spun down. These custom HDs are put in custom racks with custom logic boards all designed to be very low-power. The upper limit of how much I/O they can perform is surprisingly low - only so many drives can be spun up to full speed on a given rack. I'm not sure how they stripe their data, so the perceived throughput may be higher based on parallel retrievals across racks, but if they're using the same erasure coding strategy that S3 uses, and writing those fragments sequentially, it doesn't matter - you'll still have to wait for the last usable fragment to be read.<p>I think this will be a definite game-changer for enterprise customers. Hopefully the rest of us will benefit indirectly - as large S3 customers move archival data to Glacier, S3 costs could go down.",1345610423

Many programs were in BASIC so a lot of peeking and poking about in the code and memory to see what you could do with the computer and programs.  Lot of reading and hand-written/mind work between times with hands-on access to school computers.<p>Once I got my own computer VIC-20, i got lots of mags and books (especially the programmers reference guide) more time to experiment and try out hand-converted assembly routines in my programs.<p>Commodore 64, man the pirated disks were everywhere... also was the beginning of copy protected disks - and then to push back the protected software copier and cracked programs...  lots more books and magazines to learn (the magazines were getting more technical then like the Transactor magazine, a true Commodore programming mag... ahhh), as well as copied text files from BBSs becoming more prevalent (see textfiles.com for a sample of independent information people exchanged)<p>Once I got my modem I called around a lot, got some files but the discussion forums were also an attraction, though the audience was limited to usually folks within the general area of the BBS. Soon I became a sysop and worked on my board as well as called others. Lots of hacking on the boards to personalize them, add modifications, do new functions like inter-BBS message networks, etc.<p>BBSs came in different varieties, besides operating system/computer (mine were on the Commodore 64) there were boards with lots of on-bbs games, some with pirated software, others did message boards (mine was more a message board), some tried to do porn and stuff for profit, never got into that so don't know much of that aspect.  Hackers at that era besides cracking started doing demos and intros for cracked games, its surprising how much of a show you can put on with a few K of ram on a 1 mghz computer.<p>Internet creeped into neighborhoods and BBS callership dried up - except for the more dedicated sysops and their boards (mine lasted till around 2004, mainly due to Hard disk failure without a backup. :-/<p>I think it was better in a way for development as absence or less accessibility makes the heart grow fonder and gave us time to plan things out between whatever computer opportunity you were deprived of.  Also a lot of the technologies we use now were in their infancy in the day, so some of us old geezer grock why computers/software do this or that because we saw it when it originally came on the scene.<p>Today you have such more higher level languages, and supercomputers compared to the old times, the complex is pretty much a cakewalk to the general programming public now.  So much accessibility and inter-connetedness too.<p>Back then it was mainly a nerds only club, your mom wouldn't even get into the same room with the computer.  Now the general public is here, which means you got lots of noobs and wannabes all over the place.<p>Now also has a lot more distractions, not just games and facebook, but also the avalanche of hardware/ programming/ etc. technologies that are being pushed out at us every day.

When I think back to the 1960s and 1970s in the US, the first difference that strikes me is that we were resource-bound.<p>* Hardware was expensive, so back in the age of minicoputers _you_ went to the computer. And perhaps first to the card punch room to make changes to your deck. (Painful memories.)<p>* Connectivity was both expensive and slow. Anyone remember acoustic couplers? Don Lancaster's revolutionary TV typewriter? Their financial heart attack when the first BBS phone bill came in?<p>* Information was obvious scarcer, but it could be found if you networked in meatspace.

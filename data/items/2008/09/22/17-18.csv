Using unit testing, has its place, especially when working with parts that have clear input/output ranges, or in large systems, where your piece of code has to be integrated somewhere else, so you want to make sure it works before committing it.<p>BUT, programming according to Tests, is not a good idea.  Tests are not the END RESULT, not the ultimate user of your code!!!  Instead of tests being for what they are: testing your input/output,  they are being used to design systems.  So, you are designing your programs according to tests, and not their ultimate functionality.<p>Here is another thing that I think:  Weaker programmers prefer TDD.

We live in an apartment on the lower level of our house and AirBnB the upstairs, which more than covers the mortgage. By contracting part-time at higher rates, I have more free time to devote to spending time with my son, which I think lowers other kinds of more meaningful, less quantifiable risk.

This reply may be a bit rambling as a result.<p>If the FPGA on the bus is doing concurrent GC, we&#x27;d need a way to mark pointers and integers reliably. It means breaking all C code that does pointer manipulation, and breaking custom tagged pointer implementations. Niche languages and applications wouldn&#x27;t have the buy in, and justifiably so, to set global policy on memory. On a developer machine you could experiment, but on a consumer device you would need to use whatever the OS and the bulk of applications have decided on.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s not a bad thing though? The OS would need to provide implementations of malloc and free, and other primitives, that are tied to the hardware. But I suppose that&#x27;s not unreasonable.<p>Except when it comes to virtualization. The FPGA isn&#x27;t fixed function, but on the timescales that modern VMMs provide slices of CPU time to virtual machines, reprogramming an FPGA is an eternity. So we would gain in potential performance but lose in flexibility, substantially.<p>The biggest problem would be legacy C code. Code that treats &quot;void*&quot; and &quot;long&quot; as interchangeable values. And that includes a lot of hand-written JITs, where coercing values between pointers and word-sized integers is prevalent.<p>Rambling aside on potential upsides and downsides: The world would probably be a better place if pointers and integers were separated and strongly typed down to the hardware level. It would be a pain, but if the null pointer is a billion dollar mistake, placing all bets on the Princeton architecture may yet be a trillion dollar mistake this century.",1441076167

But where I think this is harmful is for rationalists who don&#x27;t want to acknowledge that some things may be true but ultimately unprovable or unexplainable because of the limited human perspective.  That&#x27;s what I think is interesting about philosophy and metaphysicsâ€”the ability to play around and ask what-if about things which probably <i>are</i> unknowable.

Interestingly he mentions moving to a generational collector first, before moving to concurrent. It seems the Go developers have decided to go the other way, i.e. make the collector concurrent, but not generational. One of the reasons given for going generational first is implementing a write-barrier, but from the blog post it sounds like that is implemented for this concurrent collector anyway, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/GvA0DaCI2BU/SmEelQsFybkJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/GvA0DaCI2BU/SmEel...</a>",1441076152

10150454,comment,10146639,10149854,0,0,robotkilla,,,"The problem for me was this - I was spending more time working in an office than with my daughter or on anything I actually wanted to achieve. For 10 years I worked for various companies as a full time employee. The last company I worked for broke me - I was there for 4 years, pulled a few all-nighters, got in at 8am, left at 6pm, worked through holidays, worked some weekends - the whole &quot;good employee&quot; gambit.<p>Meanwhile, the more money I made, the more I / my ex-wife spent. By the time I quit that job (and jobs in general) I had almost nothing to show for myself outside of knowledge and experience (which is very valuable in its own right of course).\nI had very little in savings - and yes this was due to my own money management problems and not with being an employee (my daughter&#x27;s old school was almost $20k per year, rent was the same), but that&#x27;s irrelevant when life is staring you in the face.<p>Also, I had been bouncing between jobs and job titles for nearly a decade - this was prior to anyone really using the term &quot;fullstack&quot; to describe what I was doing (I can&#x27;t even count the number of conversations I had where I was told to choose either frontend or backend work), and I was constantly struggling with management who wanted to pigeonhole me and push me towards a specific career path... that of me becoming a manager.\nMore of my time was wasted on office politics, water cooler talk and socializing at bars with my coworkers than I care to admit as well.<p>I came to realize that I hated the lifestyle associated with being a fulltime tech employee. I hated the free meals in the kitchen, random mid-afternoon beer breaks, and all the other &quot;perks&quot; that I now view as carrots on a stick.<p>As a contractor I can easily make $12k+ per month if I find the right client (I&#x27;ve done this multiple times). In the last 9 months I made $90k (reduced my prices in order to get clients easier)... but that&#x27;s only if I&#x27;m working 8 hours a day with steady contracts which almost never happens (like I mentioned, I don&#x27;t bother looking for steady contracts)... and these types of contracts are typically for very demanding clients so they&#x27;re very stressful.<p>I value variety more than stability, and frankly I don&#x27;t want to die with the realization that I only helped upper management and owners pursue their dreams while mine died a quiet death.<p>I too want my daughter to have the best opportunity and life possible, but I&#x27;m not sure how working for $110k per year for 10 hours a day in an office with people I hate is going to give her better opportunities than what I&#x27;m doing now. She&#x27;s still getting an education, she has all the tech she could possibly want (minus a cellphone), and she&#x27;s a smart kid. I would prefer to get her out of the public education system, but it actually seems to be working better for her than her private school did.<p>side note: i only went to college for 2 years and it was to get a graphic design degree. i taught myself how to program when i was 8 years old on qbasic - video games was always the motivating factor, I fell into webdev by mistake and then got good at it.",1441076109

The intellectual heavyweight on this topic from a philosophical standpoint is the late Michel Foucault, who wrote a book called <i>Discipline and Punish</i> studying the origin of the prison. It&#x27;s not an easy read (I strongly suspect Foucault just banged out his first draft on a typewriter and then browbeat his publisher into printing it without any revisions) but an extremely thought-provoking one.<p>Basically his thesis is that in earlier times, most work was agricultural and lawbreaking was treated as tantamount to attacking the king of a country, so terrible retributions and tortures would be visited on the body of offenders in a way that was meant to mirror the (metaphorical) injury to the body of the monarch (which was the embodiment of society, law and so on). although such punishments were gruesome (and often had the unintended effect of creating sympathy or notoriety for criminals) they were not actually administered that often and there was actually a lot of wiggle room between what the law said and how it was enforced, which had the purpose of acting as a political safety valve while still making it easy to crack down on real threats (truly awful crimes, or waves of crime by rebellious mobs etc.).<p>At the dawn of the industrial age, the factors of economic production shifted away from land and towards other forms of capital, and manufacturing shifted away from skilled craftsmen in self-policing guilds towards factories and so on. The division of labor and specialization made organization essential, and first the workplace, then also schools, hospitals, and eventually prisons were reconstituted in the image of military camps, since standardization and deindividuation had long proved their worth in military conflict.<p>Foucault argues that organizing, quantizing, and generally systematizing the punishment of crimes led to an increasingly impersonal approach based on surveillance and the manufacture of compliant behavior as a social product (note, for example, the oddly anthropomorphic architecture of Pentonville prison, which was heavily influenced by Benthamite concepts of continuous surveillance: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice#/media/File:Pentonvilleiso19.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice#/media/Fil...</a>). Insofar as this disciplinary approach became the norm across society as the middle class displaced the peasantry as the primary political force, so too it made society more and more neurotic and whole industries sprang up to manage and indeed optimize these neuroses. Further, establishment of prisons as a mainstream social technology practically guaranteed the dissemination of criminal knowledge between inmates, providing society with a way to extract value from criminal enterprises at the same time that expanding the scope of criminalization proved an effective tool for restraining whole sections of the population by channeling criminal energies into fairly predictable and manageable channels.<p>tl;dr by default, we&#x27;re actually cogs in a big economic machine that molds our entire perception of reality. Various science fiction films like <i>The Matrix</i> make a similar argument in allegorical terms.",1441075826

Its embedded nature means that any &quot;client&quot; of a shared DB is free to deadlock the whole thing (if the client dies) or corrupt the database&#x27;s structure (if the client has a memory bug).<p>By the time you have a working robust multi-client system, you have completely reinvented half of what an RDBMS provides, since you will have pushed most functionality into a central server to avoid the lack of robustness its embedded nature brings, to simplify coordination of recovery when it (inevitably) crashes, and to centralize the rest of the infrastructure you have to build around it.<p>Its tools are crap: it can&#x27;t tell you how big a database is without traversing every single entry, they hold locks while writing to the terminal (meaning you can&#x27;t pipe them into a pager without freezing the whole DB), and if one of them crashes (due to e.g. a dropped SSH connection) they&#x27;ll bring down the whole DB due to stale locks.<p>Everything is underdocumented, especially the knobs you have to tweak to make it not run out of memory.  Its more &quot;advanced&quot; features are unusuably buggy.  Partition traversal (by cursor) is completely broken, and if you try to use partitions and key compression at once, things crash.  MVCC inexplicably keeps thousands of transactions open, causing out-of-memory issues.<p>Its C++ interface is a joke.  Somehow they managed to take an &quot;object-oriented&quot; C library, and jam it into C++ in a way that completely tosses all the benefits of C++&#x27;s object-orientedness.  RAII is <i>not</i> a concept the developers were familiar with: objects are created by factory functions and are variably and inconsistently freed by either their &quot;parent&quot; object, their own methods, and their destructors.  Do the wrong thing, and you trample memory, likely corrupting the database.  This is surprisingly easy due to the lack of documentation.<p>And my sympathy to anyone who tries to run SQLite on this bad boyâ€¦ combined with SQLite&#x27;s shoddy track record interpreting any query more complicated than a key-value lookup, it would be a wonder if you&#x27;re able to get any data in and out intact.<p>Sorry for the rant.

As long as we continue to worship grades over learning, scores over intellectual bravery and testable facts over the application of knowledge, kids will never believe us when we tell them that learning is valuable in and of itself.&quot;<p>And whose fault is that ?<p>Maybe the fact that there are too few jobs.<p>Maybe the fact that wealth inequality is so skewed that only a handful of people are generating all the demand in the labor market.<p>When I survey the state of science in 2015 - there is literally no shortage of avenues to explore. If the demand side of the free market worked well, then their would by now be a pill to cure cancer and would only cost 1 dollar.<p>That is so much innovation locked up in the minds of kids born today. But we spent more and more time teaching them more and more useless stuff since the job market is unable to generate enough demand pushing people to have better CVs, etc.<p>A high school kid today can start innovating and doing all sorts of cool things for very little capital. There is not even much need for schooling. Most of the greatest minds of the past did not even have a formal education - what they did have was a lot of free time.<p>Boredom and Laziness is the source of human ingenuity, not mindless exercises with no real purpose.",1441073491

I can publish a website out of this as Drive is actually retiring that functionality.<p>Also, unlike many Drive apps, where I have to share my information with a third party provider, or &quot;trust&quot; the app, Sandstorm doesn&#x27;t let my apps betray me. Privacy is inherent in the design.<p>But the key thing, is if I don&#x27;t like my host, I CAN LEAVE. I am at the point that I loathe storing my data with Google. I love Gmail, and I wish I could take it with me and put it on a server run by a company I trust. But I can&#x27;t do that. With Sandstorm, I can. I can run the app I want on the host I want. I have control of my app, my experience, and my data.<p>Google ruins my experience on a weekly basis.

It&#x27;s the reason their failure is virtually guaranteed relative to the privileged kids. The underprivileged kid is one student, competing against the privileged kid, who is essentially a multi-person team of cheaters with a bankroll.<p>Secondly because, the answers the authors gave to the question pretty clearly demonstrate that they&#x27;re only thinking of this subject from their perspective. And it sounds like their perspective is that of the parents to the privileged kids.<p>This could&#x27;ve been an article about parental involvement in academics and the impact it has on fairness and meritocracy and social mobility. Instead it&#x27;s some rich ladies talking about how their kids would&#x27;ve been even more privileged if they did a little less of their homework for them.",1441072940

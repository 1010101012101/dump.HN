In the age of Wikipedia and Google Scholar you can learn anything you try to. The only limit is your courage. <<<<p>I down voted you not because of the swiss cheese holes in your ideas but this sentence. Sorry but given that some of your ideas assume a lot of basic research and the devil is in the details such a remark didn't jive with me. Your ideas have been clearly based on extrapolation and well that doesn't always equate to actually implementing the system. If someone achieves the harder items on this list then I would be pleasantly surprised, but until then those items are just science fiction. I've talked about the ones that have caught my eye below.<p>>>> - camera drones to provide a ""real-time Google Earth"" <<<<p>You're forgetting the costs associated with maintaining a large fleet of drones, every drone takes up energy to not only stay aloft but to beam down pictures using whatever radio gear is being used at the end, drone by drone those costs will add up and the total cost of keeping an entire fleet in the air will be prohibitive. Of course one way around would be to use balloons, but then you have to make sure that drift in either scenario is as little as possible and you can correct for it. There are day-to-day variations in weather patterns and building something that can stay aloft and provide a steady picture within storms is quite challenging indeed. If you solve all of the issues then you run into the issue associated with manipulating all of that video and stitching it seamlessly to specific geographic locations. Remember your balloon etc. might be swaying so there won't be an exact match between what the video camera is recording within a certain set of pixels and what you think that area is. You'll have to geotag sets of pixels to figure out that this is the live stream of street X and so on, that's really really hard to do and imagine you have a city of these things and you're trying to do that in real-time. The sheer number crunching involved will be huge and again impractical. Then you have the optics themselves, you'll have to put up a very special camera indeed to cover a maximum possible area per drone while maintaining a usable level of resolution. Perhaps you will decide to use multiple cameras or something, but either way creating something like that within weight, costs constraints is simply difficult.<p>Then there's that other tiny thing, all of this needs to produce enough value to pay for itself... Given all of the costs that have been sunk in what economic use could such a thing find that couldn't be done in much more cheaper and pragmatic ways?<p>>>> - camera satellites for same purpose (see DARPA SEE-ME challenge) <<<<p>I don't know enough to comment on the practicality of this, but I do know enough to whistle at the amount of cost this will require. Either you will have to launch a satellite into geostationary orbit or launch a lot of satellites into overlapping orbits so that each area gets covered all the time... Then again there's the problem of achieving resolution in the video and having something large enough that could actually store all of the content and then beam it back to earth in real time. All of this sounds prohibitively expensive and doable only with military funding.<p>>>> - cheap laser scanners for self-driving cars and robots <<<<p>Agreed. Personally I think that sooner or later people will start forgoing laser scanning and use something cheaper such as an array of webcams to do hyper-stereopsis and then interpolate that with other data to get a good enough idea of the world.<p>>>> - genetically engineered supercrops for the developing world that provide protein, fiber, and every vitamin <<<<p>That's a nice goal and the world needs it, but aside from the difficulty of creating the crop there are tons of pesky real world issues that need to be overcome including the fact that few countries would allow such a crop to grow at all it would be probably banned until further ""testing"" which would again inflate the cost dramatically. There are lots of real world schleps over here, which can be overcome but will necessitate significant backing.<p>I think that solving the problem of multi-storey stacked farms might be a better bet. (but it will be really challenging as well)<p>>>> - ""brain backup"" using high-res MRI + in-depth biographical interview + DNA sample <<<<p>Given how little we know about intelligence and the way the brain truly functions and that this is still in the basic research stage, I would be shocked if anyone could create a ""brain backup"" from just these 3 datasets. There are several non-trivial challenges that need to be resolved before doing anything like this. How do we know that what we relate as consciousness isn't implicitly a certain configuration of synapses in a very specific manner that is influenced by environmental factors as well? Clearly DNA alone does not explain everything, you have several epigenetic factors within the womb that makes the person who s/he is. Just the timing of a few series of hormones at specific intervals can radically alter the end result. Then outside the womb you have day to day factors which take this really complex system and push it into oh so many directions. Each factor leaving a mark. How can you capture that with just an MRI, an interview and a DNA sample? Within the next 5 to 150 years we might develop some hypothetical technique that allows us to do this, but clearly until then this is unpractical.<p>>>> - seasteading <<<<p>Energy. Aside from the resource issues related to creating a seastead there are tons of issues stemming from energy, currently the plan is to just boat in diesel, but to create a truly independent and self sustaining system there needs to be a way to capture and efficiently store energy on the seastead itself. That is much harder than it looks and it will take some time to make that possible. This will get done sooner or later, but this tiny detail will bog down a lot of progress due to the usual mix of costs, quality, and last minute issues.<p>---<p>Most people's view of the future is off because of the tiny details and the things that they tend to overlook. We all tend to do that and forget the real world is a harsh master capable of bringing down the wrath of economics as well. Some of these things ought to be implemented, but whether or not they actually are at the end of the day is another matter.<p>I don't mean to deflate you or anything, but the truth is that you need to be cognisant of the challenges and do a reality check if you ever want to implement something like this at all. A lot of these systems are possible technologically, but actually doing them is another thing. I hope that you go on to achieve this list. It would be amazing.<p>Good luck.",1344065779

The <i>economy</i> gave us this 'business voucher', and consumer web startups are the only thing the voucher is good for.",1344064290

The problem is quite shocking to me, because it's their flagship product that's totally unrepairable, so the solution will probably be to just give those affected a new device. The only reusable parts may be logic board and disk. From an environmental standpoint, and of course knowing that this is just factored into the rather high price, this makes me angry.",1344064210

Since children cannot link to any node other than their own children, there are no cycles.  Since each children cannot refer to their parent, the graph is directed.  (Technically, all acyclic graphs must be directed, as a bidirectional link would result in a two-node cycle.  But if you don't count those...)<p>A list would either be a zero or more equal-rank siblings, or a tree where each node had exactly one child.  Since that's not how most people take notes, technically they are using a directed acyclic graph rather than a list.<p>In conclusion, words differ in meaning depending on context :)",1344064058

Better machine tools, high-speed digital communications and onboard computers, better material science, the ability to run computer simulations of different flight profiles or to model the operation of a rocket engine, etc. However, in another sense the Falcon 9/Dragon represent very primitive designs. Indeed, 1950s or 1960s designs even. A simple cylindrical 2 stage LOX/Kerosene booster in combination with a simple frustrum shaped manned capsule. These designs have heritage going all the way back to project Mercury.",1344063991

Naturally, with no management structure, anyone was free to take up an office, but hardly anyone wanted to.<p>The receptionist who was giving the tour, indicated that Valve had constructed more offices than people actually wanted to use, so they were considering tearing many of them down. Most employees preferred working in more open areas in the midst of the rest of their ""cabal"".<p>As far as other perks go, Valve employees already have a nice selection of free snacks, drinks, in-office massage sessions, etc... I'm sure there are ways to incentivize Valve employees to do less appealing work, and I wouldn't be surprised at all to hear that they already do this on an ad hoc basis, but they would have to go a little bit beyond your traditional office perks.",1344063659

9234834,comment,9229932,9234563,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"> Can they be points but only rational points?<p>They can be, but then the total area of your pixels would be zero.  Which is fine, since this isn&#x27;t a real monitor we&#x27;re talking about, this is a math monitor.  But:<p>One property of our computer monitor that we&#x27;d want is that when displaying white, it should have uniform brightness -- the amount of light emitted from a rectangle R should be proportional to area(R).  The total amount of light emitted from the monitor should be nonzero, too.  Let&#x27;s say the area of the whole monitor is 1 and so is the luminosity.<p>Your pixels are what&#x27;s emitting light -- they&#x27;re point-sources?  Suppose p is one of your pixels (or its location).  Then let&#x27;s consider a sequence smaller and smaller squares around p, with side lengths 1/20, 1/21, 1/22, 1/23, ...  The luminosity of each of these squares of sidelength 1/n must be the square&#x27;s area, 1/n^2, because the brightness is uniform.  So the pixel p must have zero luminosity, because if it had nonzero luminosity, then some very small rectangle around it would be emitting more light than it should be, and the monitor would not have uniform brightness.<p>From this argument it seems that each pixel&#x27;s luminosity is zero.  And then you can enumerate the pixels, since they form a countable set: p_1, p_2, p_3, ....  The luminosity of the whole screen is a countable sum, which is sum[i = 1 to infinity](luminosity(p_i)) = sum[i = 1 to infinity](0) = 0.<p>So I don&#x27;t think the idea of dividing a math-monitor into countably many pixels, each with zero area, works.  It&#x27;s OK that the total area of the pixels is zero, but you have to accept non-uniform luminosity or say that the pixels aren&#x27;t point sources, they &quot;bleed&quot;.  However, if you have uncountably many pixels, then it&#x27;s okay if each &quot;pixel&quot; (whatever) has zero luminosity.  You only get nonzero luminosity when talking about sets of pixels with nonzero area -- their luminosity on the uniformly bright screen is proportional to the set&#x27;s area.  That&#x27;s perfectly compatible with intuition -- the same way it&#x27;s intuitive that the area of a unit square is 1, even though it&#x27;s an uncountable union of sets having one point each, each of whose area is zero.",1426801904

What I meant by &quot;rents are not always bad&quot; is that &quot;rent&quot; is a positive (i.e., value-free) concept, not a normative (moral) one. &quot;Rent&quot; in economics merely implies that the profits are in excess of a competitive-equilibrium outcome/allocation. In this case, the competitive outcome is perverse -- nobody innovates because, without IP, you pay for the cost of R&D but &quot;copycats&quot; can steal the idea without paying. (It&#x27;s a prisoners&#x27; dilemma.) So profits from a patent <i>are</i> rent, insofar as they come from the protection per se. As I acknowledge, I think those rents are economically useful -- as an economist, I don&#x27;t have anything interesting to say as to whether they are <i>morally</i> acceptable, as you discuss in your post. For example, it&#x27;s a fair argument to say that &quot;ideas should be free,&quot; and that the purpose of IP is not to enrich/honor/etc the innovator but merely to give him the incentive to contribute the idea to the social good. Or you might argue the opposite of that. I don&#x27;t really have an opinion. Hopefully this clarifies the way economists use the word &quot;rent.&quot;",1426801078

I can easily believe that my entire IP block was cut for being a hosting provider.<p>I now pay some company to deliver my personal mail, which is just dumb, and clearly isn&#x27;t caused by them being better about spam (as I sent no spam): it is caused by a militarized anti-spam-crazed group of people who have managed to build a system that essentially requires an oligopoly for email to function. A lot of these people don&#x27;t even consider it a problem to use &quot;report as spam&quot; as a ways to punish companies for things that aren&#x27;t even sending spam (which is something I only bring up as it demonstrates the &quot;militant&quot; comment).<p>The reality is that an open internet where people can talk to each other without going through third parties requires a world in which you, heaven forbid, receive some spam. It is actually a similar construction as the one for why we should have network neutrality: large internet carriers in the world of email should, if you really believe in open access, not be allowed to say &quot;these people can&#x27;t send mail because they are too small and not paying someone&quot;. We all need to accept at least a little spam to guarantee everyone can send mail.<p>If this means that you have to get better at dealing with spam, as some of the heavy-handed techniques people have put in place for dealing with spam are no longer possible, well: so be it; and if that means you need to turn off the notifications for new email on your phone to keep from getting angry when you receive some spam (which tends to come up as a reason to hate spam), I hope people realize that they caused their own reason to be upset, and that getting notifications for anything is probably unhealthy, at least for you, anyway.<p>Sadly, the large companies who have slowly come to &quot;own email&quot; have no incentive to break this cycle, whether in action or in words, as the current state of affairs is what is giving them their power: whether they build solutions that can solve spam in a way that is both fair and federated, or they just try to educate users about how to better deal with spam and decrease the stress in their lives (including telling people to stop letting email interrupt them), it will just harm them. This doesn&#x27;t sound like something the private sector can solve.",1426800855

When you are coming from the point of hey, look at how good these look and we could really learn something here.  It is a different approach then saying, damn you guys really suck at your job.  Sometimes a defensive person will still react badly even with this approach, but usually when they think you are helping it is not nearly as bad.  And it may take more than 1 time to get the point across.<p>If your competitors aren&#x27;t that good, then compare yourself to other companies that are really successful and show why it might be good to follow trend setters.  Also, do this to make sure you aren&#x27;t the one off base, sometimes we all get there.<p>The end game is to get the team to see the light (e.g. potential), not prove you are right or they are wrong.

The problem is maintaining deliverability for anything more than very casual usage of mail into a very complicated ecosystem. At any point in time a random switch can flip on some heuristic somewhere and suddenly a large mail provider will reject you, or you&#x27;re on a blacklist that provides no explanation or ability to remove your mails, and that isn&#x27;t isolated: it will spread throughout the ecosystem, and leave a stain that can linger for a long time.<p>I&#x27;ve run a few-thousand person newsletter mail list for more than ten years, and fairly recently switched to SES because it&#x27;s simply not possible to guarantee deliverability even at that modest scale running it yourself from your own servers. If you&#x27;re not hooked into the ecosystem then you have to fight ongoing battles that only a professional in the mail deliverability business has time and connections to understand and effectively win.<p>Even then, you have to be very careful: don&#x27;t mention sums of money (e.g. censor all discussion of research funding), don&#x27;t trigger dumb spamassassin rules (e.g. sentences with lots of long words in a scientific paper), don&#x27;t talk about known trigger words (e.g. no scientific articles on the role of growth hormone in mouse aging) and so forth.<p>It is crazy.

The type error messages are cryptic compared to what it could say. Worse, if you then take it and serialized it to JSON or something then you won&#x27;t even get a compile error, so it may not be for a while that you even realize there&#x27;s and error and that can be hard to trace down depending on your code.<p>I really am failing to see why you&#x27;re defending this. It&#x27;s like trying to defend programming without a debugger because you have printf. Why not make things clearer, always? Why can&#x27;t error messages be easier to understand and more human friendly? Shouldn&#x27;t that be the goal?",1426799165

They make money by sitting on something no one else is allowed to have. They don&#x27;t have to do anything more than sit back and collect checks. Sure, they bought the land originally, but there&#x27;s no more investment to be made after that. They can invest in a nicer building or grounds, or compete on services such as &quot;free&quot; utilities or quicker repairs, but those are above and beyond the &quot;rent-seeking&quot; part of his revenue. He could just rent an empty lot, like a trailer park or campground.<p>This is analogous to, for example, telephone lines. They cost a lot to initially build out, but once they&#x27;re there, the phone company only has to charge people for access. They provide a service back at the switching station, but most of what they&#x27;re getting money for is owning lines that already exist. It&#x27;s harder to separate rent from their other revenue, but it&#x27;s there.<p>It generalizes to all revenue that is of the &quot;sit back and collect checks&quot; variety. Cellular carriers sitting on a chunk of spectrum they can sell access to. They can just rent it out to MVNOs if they don&#x27;t want to provide those services themselves.  Film studios sitting on a catalog of work they can sell, license, etc. So yes, IP revenues are definitely rents.",1426799105

If, as other commenters are saying, no we can&#x27;t trust libraries, but yes we have to anyways, then a library may be good enough for non-safety critical applications and get all the adoption and work. Then you come along with your safety critical application for which this library isn&#x27;t trustworthy enough (by assumption). What are you to do here?<p>I&#x27;d love to see a bigger ecosystem of safety critical code floating around. Libraries in it would be less full-featured and optimized than their less trustworthy counterparts with wider adoption, but it&#x27;s a niche I really hope to see develop as code takes over the world.",1426798961

Nothing about immutable objects means that you are going to write thread safe code.  Pretty much period.<p>Worse, nothing about functional programming is necessarily about immutability.  It is a convenience on small and easy problems, but is far from required.  Consider how your computer adds two numbers.  Lots of things change state under highly timed situations to give you that answer.  It is not some magic table lookup that works with immutable facts.<p>I may just be bitter by a system right now that is using immutable objects everywhere.  I realize this is a straw man, but with heavy reliance on deep (3+ levels) of immutable relationships, it is not uncommon to find crap that is the equivalent of this:<p><pre><code>    String foo = &quot;hello&quot;;
    Character bar = foo.charAt(0);

    ...
    //We need to make sure bar is capitalized everywhere
    baz = bar.toUpperCase();
    //Now to find everywhere this matters and let the caller know.

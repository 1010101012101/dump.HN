I do make aerodynamically correct fixed-wing and lifting-body type paper airplanes, however, and I have had a LOT of fun playing with aerodynamics in this hobby.<p>One thing to keep in mind regaring stall is that it's 100% dependent on angle of attack, not speed (something Popular Mechanics gets entirely wrong).   What happens basically is that at a high angle of attack the air layer doesn't track the wing surface properly and so you are deprived of standard lift.  With certain aircraft designs (SR-71 for example) this is very hard to make happen (but the SR71 can stall it's engines before the wings stall due to AoA).<p>If you are faced with a stall, I would expect the first thing to do is to pitch down to reduce angle of attack then accellerate and pitch up to get out of it.  T-tail designs are generally disfavored because the elevators can get blanked by the wings in a deep stall, but with the A330 this isn't an issue as it doesn't have this tail design.<p>I find it puzzling that a professional pilot would pitch <i>up</i> in response to a stall warning.  Popular Mechanics is right to flag that is as difficult to understand.",1323334660

You not only have to deal with elastic screen size, you also can't tweak to pixel-perfection nearly so easily as you can with iOS. If this were all that was wrong, Android would be better. However, due to fragmentation, any app with nontrivial data parsing/caching/display requirements that wants to be both widely usable as well as robust and stable needs to (in <i>my</i> experience):<p>1) Use the compatibility library for lazy-loading and easy reloading of data via CursorLoaders and SimpleCursorAdapter. This means mostly abandoning ArrayAdapter (it can easily cause eternal garbage collection if your dataset is slightly too object-heavy), assuming your data is mostly expressed in rows in the SQLite database.<p>2) Use Content Providers, as this is the only simple way to make the CursorLoaders work. Lots of boilerplate and semantics to accidentally get wrong, and URI overhead that you really don't give a damn about.<p>3) Either use a service or something resembling one that's initialized in Application#onCreate() to make API calls that store into the database (having them run inside an activity can cause nasty bugs if you're not careful as AsyncTasks are unceremoniously killed when rotation causes the activity to be killed and recreated)<p>I'd have to say as a developer of both iOS and Android, iOS is way, way more flexible, and gives you better APIs, and frees your mind to work on <i>interesting</i> problems. Android has too many development dead-ends that are easy to waste time on, and an irritatingly slow build process, if you want to ensure your build doesn't have any bad information from dirty caches that failed to clean. I can't say how many times I switched git branches only to find images and color resources still stuck on old values, even when I was exporting to deploy the apk.<p>tl;dr: Even if Android is worth developing for, it's still a time suck because a lot of little things cause problems. Nowhere is it made more clear that simplicity requires complexity than in the comparison between iOS and Android, because Android shoves all of that complexity in your face with not a whole lot in terms of guidance to guide the way. Meanwhile, Apple's documentation is world-class.<p>EDIT: not to mention different devices appearing differently because of stupid default themes, the lack of a stable image loader service that doesn't cause memory and application response issues at volume, crashing inexplicably because some bitmap refused to decode, random devices with non-compliant h.264 decoders failing on perfectly valid videos - randomly during successful playback, too! - vocal commenters/raters using extremely old devices complaining about the lack of support, occasionally nondeterministic state preservation when paging out views/activities, and a fuckton of other shit that's annoying as hell.",1323333592

Perhaps Apple provides better data than Google upon which to make estimates. Perhaps the timing of the data leads to more accurate estimates for Apple. You can't simply say that because one estimate was wrong that everything else shouldn't be trusted. (Well you can say it, but there's no logical basis that underpins the argument) Perhaps they estimated the downloads based on sales, who knows. A week before Google released their data the estimate was useful, now it isn't because we have better data, that's simply how life goes.<p>In the business of selling apps I'd much rather I went to market underestimating the size of the market than overestimating it. To me, one more download is one more client to support with no revenue upon which to service it. I guess if I developed for the Marketplace I could have 40% more freeloaders than anticipated.

3328229,story,,,8,11,m43,"Ask HN: What framework to learn? Unusual situation",,"I am a student in New York. My (well off) uncle has offered me $10,000 USD to build a fully functional web application for an idea of his, with a deadline in mid-January. He is doing this as an incentive for me to learn how to program - I have experience with Wordpress and the like, but nothing substantial.<p>I have spent the last few days heavily researching which framework is suitable for this project, and now I find myself in choice limbo. It seems that whichever framework I choose to learn from scratch can do everything I need, once I invest enough time in it - so now it is a question of which is the easiest to pick up and implement. I am aware that this question has been beaten into the ground innumerable times, however, the urgency of this project and my current lack of knowledge is holding me back from making a decision based on what I've read online.  I appreciate any input on your experience with beginner programmers.<p>The web application is a CRUD app that requires subdomains separate from each other, each with several hundred authenticated users (that either register or are imported), frequent batch/individual editing of a table of those users with some specific functions, and a decent amount of email sending.<p>It seems like this could be easily accomplished with Rails, Django, Symfony, or CakePHP. Which of these (or other) frameworks and respective languages offer the best environment for someone to learn from scratch? What books or online resources would you suggest?<p>I am only allowed to ask for advice, unfortunately I cannot pay for assistance with this project.",1323331701

Only, I don't store many bytes: I just store lots of objects... enough that I have in the past estimated that I owned >1% of all objects on S3.<p>(<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2154792"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2154792</a> <- here I describe how I had been making a billion PUTs per month when Amazon comes out and claims they only have <300 billion objects stored in S3.)<p>However, in the last few days? I've binged, and this week I'm purging. I've been doing as many as 10 million (and never less than 4 million) deletes per hour for /days/.<p>Why? One of the things I use S3 for (storing SHSH data, a giant man-in-the-middle attack against Apple's dysfunctional iPhone software protection systems) was simply wasting space. :(<p>(Specifically, I realized that I had, due to some debugging code I never really realized was for debugging only and thereby never got around to deleting, had been storing every single request in and out to the service throughout its history in XML form, in addition to the tightly encoded binary.)<p>The thing to realize here: DELETE requests are free. PUT/LIST requests are $0.01/1k, GET/HEAD are $0.01/10k, but DELETE requests are not billed by Amazon at all; even the bandwidth for them ""won't count"" if they are made from EC2 (which I'm doing).<p>However, one can only imagine that deleting a billion objects in a few days with a billion separate tiny requests to Amazon is causing someone, somewhere, a bad week (and possibly even a ton of meetings). :(<p>(Which, honestly, I feel sorry about, but my business isn't even that profitable, so I've been having to figure out ways to cut costs, and this useless data is apparently costing me nearly $1k a month.)<p>Well, with all of this in mind, and now after almost a week of ""the onslaught"" (and even myself wondering multiple times what this many requests must be doing to their stats), Amazon conveniently announces a new API feature that lets me decrease the number of separate requests I'm making to their servers by a thousand times over...<p>...really, I cannot help but wonder ;P.",1323331506

If you just play it straight through the standard zelda part (that is, just go dungeon to dungeon), its easy to miss how it was unique. However, when interacting with people, the ability to rewind time made some really interesting and totally different (from other zelda games) puzzles. The thing to focus on wasn't the form changes, or the ""slow down time"" ability but the ""rewind to the beginning of the game and start over, but with knowledge of what you did last time"". That game was unique in zelda games because one of the currencies the game used was player knowledge about what events happen when in the 3-day time frame of the game.<p>Zelda is a series that is established on certain traditions - you go from dungeon to dungeon, and in each one get a new piece of gear that lets you explore the world more. Looking just at that part of the game, every zelda game looks the same. But I think as a series it's generally good at varying a little bit from the formula.",1323331399

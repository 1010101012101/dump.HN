90538,comment,90521,90521,0,0,breily,,,"That seems like a huge price to pay for digg - especially since I assume the way to make money off social news sites is with ads, and the type of community digg attracts is the type that blocks/ignores ads.  Maybe I'm way overestimating how many people use that, or maybe that's why they haven't been bought yet?",1197943014

For a practical book on AI itself, Norvig's Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming ...""</i><p>It is ironic that the man who wrote the book uses different methods (maths) to extract meaning from data at google ~ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=90298"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=90298</a><p>Something smells about AI. <p>It has been well funded, attracted the best minds (Minsky, McCarthy, Newell) at places like MIT, Stanford and resulted in lots of useful languages & tools. [0] From Cyc to Powerset companies have tried to use these techniques trying to assign human like intelligence to machines yet have failed. <p>Why?<p>Bruce Stirling reckons it has to do a lot with the language. [1] Assigning intelligence to what is essentially a 21'st century equivalent of knitting mills or steam engines of yesteryear.  Maybe thats why Google has taken the approach it has. Instead of creating intelligent software to find the meaning, take an insight into users who have pre-assigned intelligence to documents.  And use well known sorting, linking techniques and software engineering along with not-so-well applied math techniques. Thus make google appear to make sense of what we search for.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence</a><p>[1] <i></i>ITConversations<i></i>, <i>'Bruce Stirling, The Internet of Things, 58m, 26.4 mb, 2006MAR06'</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail717.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail717.html</a>",1197942918

2057484,comment,2050797,2056703,0,0,babeKnuth,,,"hi berntb. i upvoted your reply for the analysis.<p>a def'n of propaganda is ""information, ideas, or rumors deliberately spread widely to help or harm a person, group, movement, institution, nation, etc."" (dictionary.com). is this what you're claiming chomsky is doing? if so, what is the info he is spreading and whom is he trying to harm? i believe such a claim is VERY strong, and would fall under the area of mudslinging. it's a popular fox news tactic too.<p>A) he does NOT criticize israel more than other places (he says something similar many times elsewhere in the 3 vids). he is saying that as an american citizen, the places where the usa has an influence is where he feels he is most obligated to act. thus, if the situation in sudan is not a byproduct of usa policy, he feels the moral obligation is not as strong as in places where the usa has directly affected a region (middle east, south america, vietnam, etc.).<p>are you assuming that chomsky has said nothing about sudan?<p>i'm unsure what your critique here is. chomsky is on the record about making comments on (quick, abridged list): serbia/yugoslavia, venezuala, mexico, vietnam, iraq, afghanistan, russia, germany, iraq, iran, syria, israel, palestine, lebanon, cuba, canada, usa, china, phillipines, korea, japan, south africa, haiti, honduras, east timor, tibet, india, pakistan, libya, turkey, indonesia, brazil, egypt, jordan, georgia, colombia, cambodia, australia, etc.<p>and yes, chomsky has made commentary regarding sudan. further, it is consistent with what i mentioned above: he has public comments about the american bombing of a pharmaceutical company in sudan.\nsee here at 0:00 <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grqPwqwoOcA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grqPwqwoOcA</a>\nlots more info here: <a href=""http://www2.math.uic.edu/~takata/WorldTradeCenter/WTC_Articles/bombing_Sudan_1998.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.math.uic.edu/~takata/WorldTradeCenter/WTC_Articl...</a><p>another factor: chomsky is american. thus is it ""propaganda"" if the majority of his writings concern america? isn't this acceptable? the same concern with the fact that he's jewish and has personal ties to israel. thus why is it considered ""problematic"" if the majority of his words and thoughts concern the 2 things he is a part of? (he even mentions this at 2:00).<p>further, your ""all other left wingers"" and ""demonization of israel"" is extreme hyperbole. i'm going to ignore that comment. i find all right wingers to participate in extreme hyperbole where the demonization of anyone that disagrees with them as more or less standard.<p>B) by ""existential threat"", are you referring to ""israel's right to exist is questioned""?<p>i'll also ignore the ""sadat and plo"" unicorns-are-real statement, since as you say, no one knows whether it's true or not.<p>i'm unsure what the rest of your points are referring to. and i don't see how they support your ""chomsky writes propaganda"" thesis. it's a very weak thesis (i'm being generous). propaganda involves the spreading of misinformation (""lies"" if you will). the only point you've brought up is that ""chomsky focuses too much on israel"" (he doesn't) and ""ignores sudan"" (again, wrong). i fail to see the connection to propaganda.",1293879518

2057471,comment,2057415,2057415,0,0,EGreg,,,"I disagree with the article's sentiment. I'm glad the web is focusing on Javascript. Here's why: the web is a nice, text-based environment that is safe to execute on your computer. Each web resource may contain active scripts but they are pretty innocuous.<p>Native applications are binary and can do all sorts of nasty things. Sure, this sandbox is supposed to be safe, but what if it's not? When an application is delivered over the web, one should really make sure that it wasn't somehow changed or sabotaged. Right now this is impossible. At the very least, this proposal would have to be implemented so we can trust what is being downloaded: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2024164"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2024164</a><p>Here is what I suggest: native libraries should expose their objects to javascript, which should do the majority of the work. Kind of like PhoneGap does on the phones. These native libraries (like OpenGL, say), should be served from cdns over httpc:// and the user agent can verify that they are safe after downloading them.",1293878012

2057463,comment,2056204,2057299,0,0,strlen,,,"> I found that working in small companies blocked me from developing large amounts of useful skills (scaling, i18n, performance tuning, latency optimization, security, etc.)<p>I think it really depends on what sort of company you work for. Small companies are highly variable, but there are many where the product is expected to scale from the start (because scalability is a functional feature of the product), have internalization from the start (because of the market it's aimed for), be secure and offer a latency SLA from the start etc. There are frequently open source projects that contain great deal of legacy code that have to be revived and modernized.<p>My previous could be described that way despite having been started by a few hackers. Of course they weren't in consumer web area: the product is an email/web security system: obviously it has to be secure, it can't be slow, it should deal with messages in different languages and it has to scale to email volumes of government organizations, universities and f1000 companies. Since we were in the email sphere, most of us or code base had been in C++ and Perl, which (by the virtue of the languages' age) had a great deal of legacy code out in the open that was nonetheless very useful.<p>It may be the case that these are after thoughts in small consumer Internet companies, but there are plenty of companies which employ similar skillset (especially if the application has a web UI and is deployed ""in the cloud"") who have to deal with these issues form the start.<p>I now work for a private consumer Internet company at this time where all of these issues also matter tremendously, but we are medium size at this point. Interestingly enough I've learned a lot more of ""how to scale"" here than I have at Yahoo: at first it was surprising, but realized it was almost tautological -- scale is about the first derivative, not the absolute site; going from 20,000 machines to 25,000 machines (not real numbers, just an example) is simpler than going from 1000 to 2000 machines. I can't just say ""let's use this wonderful partitioned database and this wonderful data replication bus"", I have to build those tools first :-)<p>A formula that works for me is: take an offer where you have the opportunity to learn the most. All else is fluff (they can talk about how great it is that they're small company, but they can still be structured in the same way that a big company is). It's also a good idea to work at large, small and medium companies in different industries to see what suits you better rather than make a decision based on what someone on the Internet (including some bozo calling himself after a libc function) wrote.",1293877348

Implementing it yourself, as long as you follow the NaCl ""spec"" (a term I use very loosely here) is pretty simple, although it isn't without pitfalls; you should use the existing implementation unless there's a good reason to do otherwise, though.<p>Personally, I'm a huge fan of the everything-managed approach (hell, I started a pure-managed OS project for a reason), but I don't think that's a reason to avoid NaCl.",1293877031

There have only been a few attacks against it, and those were largely during the ""come own us"" phase.  I'm sure there will be further attacks against it, but that is the <i>last</i> issue in play here.  Cross-platform and existing standards compatibility are by far the more important ones, not to mention the benefits of code you can optimize as you see fit (Javascript, Flash, and other high-level languages).<p>Worrying about sandbox escapes from NaCl is silly when you consider the insane attack surface that existing browsers expose to the JS engine.",1293876343

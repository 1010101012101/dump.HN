5379943,comment,5379801,5379801,32,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"I had bought some songs on Sony's old ""Connect"" (iTunes clone) music store which uses DRM. It shut down and basically said the only way to keep enjoying all the music I bought was to burn all the tracks onto CD and then rip the CD back into MP3 format. (This degrades quality btw)<p>Rhapsody, another DRM music service had a weird glitch where the few songs I purchased became ""disconnected"" from my account and no longer played. They were just music files sitting there doing nothing.<p>MSN Music did the same. Google Video went down as well.<p>I bought ""2012"" on Amazon's video on demand store via Unboxed (which is terrible btw). My family night was ruined. The DRM was so invasive to prevent stream stealing that the movie got glitched midway, would pause and never unpause, would not skip forward, and disappeared from my account after upgrading the amazon player. After 2 repurchases and 2 refunds, I just pirated it. The pirated version played great, but the family already got bored and went off to do their own things.<p>Pirates pirate to avoid money -> customers pay because it's easier -> companies use DRM to punish pirates -> customers end up getting hurt in the cross-fire -> DRM makes pirating the better option for both pirates and customers(former).<p>DRM isn't a stupid idea, it's a stupid execution of a reasonable idea. Steam's DRM is reasonable. The damage to the name however, is already done. Now I avoid DRM like the plague.",1363345162

If that is the case, I recommend finishing this semester the best that you can, and then take a one or two year break from school.<p>Apply your creativity to a project that incorporates some of your education so far. Don't set a deadline, don't tell anyone about it, and don't concern yourself with whether the project can be monetized. Come up with a project that starts out small but can be built onto and improved. A project that can be used later in a larger project is ideal. Don't spend a lot of time researching before you get started; simply start on it. Don't obsess over details; remind yourself that you are working on a prototype, and that afterwards you will be building another one. Take regular breaks from the project and go back over past course materials for ideas in ways to improve your next design. Most importantly, the whole process should be FUN.<p>The one or two years spent should allow you time to fortify your education and change your subconscious attitude towards engineering.

However, given that I am new to the language, I may just not be yet able to express things as well as I could.<p>It depends very much on what you want to write.  If you want to write something related with File I/O or Network I/O in a reliable fashion, chances are that you cannot see it more beautifully implemented than in Go.  No big surprise, the language designers are known for being involved in a lot of Unix stuff.<p>On the other hand, if you want to implement a linear algebra package that has support for a lot of structures, you will see less beautiful code.  The same is somehow true for a number of algorithms that act on collections.  There are no templates, so you either Copy&Paste or you work with interface{} worst case, meaning such code is cluttered with type assertions.<p>But besides that, I think most Go code can be made beautiful.

It's what I did and found it great because it totally avoided all maths - the idea was that you came up with the ideas, you built the prototypes, solving engineering problems by doing and learning intuitively what works and what breaks rather than by maths. In fact the engineers often work for designers, so it's a question of where you'd like to be in the food chain.",1363342941

That is beside the point, which is that webapps are inherently transient - unless you have access to the ability to configure and run your own server to host the application, the ability to use it can be revoked at any time, either through malice, negligence, or the regular operation of business. There are numerous examples of all three categories. This is, in fact, worse than proprietary software. At least with proprietary software (DRM/authentication notwithstanding), you have an executable, and it works on the machine you have right now. VM software like VMWare allows you to preserve a particular software configuration indefinitely if you wish, and access that software as long as you like.",1363342686

This article pretty much directly inspired Douglas Engelbart and Ted Nelson, who in turn went on to work on the first hypertext systems (Engelbart on NLS [1] and Nelson on Project Xanadu [2]). Although today's web doesn't quite live up to the standards set for Project Xanadu (it involves microtransactions, link rot [3] prevention, the ability to trace back what links to any given page, transparent creation of compilation documents and other such things) those projects are part of history that led to us being able to have this discussion right now using a HTML-based medium.<p>Looking back at <i>As We May Think</i> and the systems it directly inspired today may be a way to help us make the internet better. It's not hard to imagine how with a few tweaks Xanadu-like micropayments + trasclusion [4] could a least partially replace banner advertising and help revitalize web journalism by making it not dependant on ad revenue.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_%28computer_system%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_%28computer_system%29</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion</a>",1363342460

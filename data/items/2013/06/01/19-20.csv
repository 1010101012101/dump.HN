It's a poor label because it often leads to this confusion.<p>400nm to 700nm is 'visible light', a factor of 1.75x, infrared is 700nm to 1mm, a factor of 1428x.<p>Only a small portion of this is significant for thermal infrared applications, which at room temperatures are about 8um-15um.<p>Near infrared, up to about 1500nm, acts pretty much like light we can't see, and can be detected well on the same CCD/CMOS sensors (which need filters to block it out).",1370116694

Sure you can find cheaper housing outside of the city, but now you've got a long commute to deal with.  Recent college grads are willing to deal with it because they don't know any better, because they think working in the valley is cool, and because they have the flexibility of being young and single.<p>The problem is that recent grads don't have the experience most of you are looking for. The people with the experience are quite often married and have two careers to think about when making a move. If you're asking me to risk the move on my own, that's one thing. If you're asking me to beg my wife to halt all progress in her career, that's another. And now you're telling me that you're not willing to pay me enough to live relatively close to work and still have the same cash flow? No thanks!<p>Edit:<p>As an aside, a lot of startups try to justify the drop in cash flow with equity. Please... stop doing this. I don't mean to say that you shouldn't offer equity, you absolutely should. However I'm already telling you that I'm risk averse. Or, put differently, I'm telling you that I need compensation that's stable and easy to value. Your equity is nice, and I definitely want it, but it's the opposite of what I'm asking you for.",1370116622

In less than two decades since the Altair 8800, we were programming on NeXTSTEP / OpenStep, Mac OS, and Window 95.  There is no current IDE for the web or web standard that can do what we did in 1995 much less 2013.  That's why developers are using iOS / Android native apps.  Open doesn't matter if I cannot ship what I want and get the user experience I want.  It is actually easier to hit all the mobile platforms than do a web app of equivalent functionality.  Add to that all the capabilities native apps have over web apps (hey look, sensors) and you get the desire.

If it's so sensitive I'm guessing that you can build a super-fast camera, which is something engineers are always looking for.

Mainly selling sets for retail and missing parts replacement.<p>""Q: Can I buy the set if my kid wants to keep it?<p>A: Yes. if your child loves the set and want to keep it, you can easily purchase it in your My Account page. You will be charged the retail price of the set and will get the next set in your queue.""[1]<p>One of the sets available is ""Green Grocer"" set number: 10185-1. If you head over to Brickpicker the current used value is $544.75. The U.S. retail price was $149.99, if Pleygo charges the <i>retail</i> price these sets yield a huge profit.<p>A friend that buys/sells used Lego bought a Green Grocer for $150 from a family and it was sold on ebay for ~$500, so the price on Brickpicker is relatively accurate.<p>---<p>""Q: What happens if my kid loses a piece?\nA: No worries - we understand that pieces can get lost during play. Our plans include a guarantee so that you will not be charged if normal loss occurs.""[1]<p>I don't know what constitutes ""a normal loss"" but this could be very costly for Pleygo.<p>There are certain parts that are set specific and cannot be ordered from Lego (many licensed products Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc). You can buy these pieces on the used market but are very expensive.<p>The biggest loss would be MiniFigures (the Lego people); there is a huge market for figures and their accessories. Especially for those that come with large sets as there is no other method to acquire them.<p>The only way to remedy (other than not shipping figures) would be to charge market price for replacement. I think it would be difficult for the company to justify to regular customers that the ""Lego guy"" they lost would cost $20-$40 to replace. Though for a collector, even paying $10 with free shipping would be great.<p>I think the <i>idea</i> is great but have a feeling over time will be overrun with collectors looking to replace pieces and buy discontinued sets for original retail.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pleygo.com/questions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pleygo.com/questions/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.brickpicker.com/bpms/set.cfm?set=10185-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brickpicker.com/bpms/set.cfm?set=10185-1</a>",1370116448

5805627,comment,5804798,5804798,23,0,j45,,,"Being able to touch 200K and not work full time:<p>When I was 20, I decided I was going to get 20 years of tech/business experience in 10 years.  I'm under 35 today.<p>By age 30, I hoped to have the experience and talent of at least a 40 year old, but have my 30's to chase what I wanted.<p>I must ask though: I'm not sure what you're wanting to get from asking those questions.  They're metrics but how you get to them, and why is more of the ""how could I apply some skills to my life"", measuring the metrics doesn't get you the results, let alone getting the result in a way that you would be happy with.<p>I'll share a bit of my story and if you like, feel free to ask, or contact me offline.<p>When I was 20, I had this habit of not thinking why I'd want to solve a problem, or a challenge, and just do it.<p>I decided on my 20 in 10 after the dot com crash as a  hedge for a life in tech.  Get ahead and stay ahead.<p>How I tied in my passion: I did my best to remember that no matter how reasonably talented I may have been with technology, I felt I wanted to learn about solving problems, and there's only one way to learn to swim, and it isn't by reading, watching, or talking about it.<p>I feel a deep kinship with focusing on solving problems by seeing them as puzzles.  I don't care if the problem is small or big, they're all worthwhile and can make a big difference in someone's life to solve if you truly care about solving problems.<p>Today, I'm a full stack guy. While I've struggled to find a title the past 10 year that fits, I'm liking ""full-stack"", combined with one of system/software architect/integrator.<p>If you're trying to make something do something with hardware or software, I can figure out a proof of concept.<p>There was no map, or plan to get where I am, or where I'm headed, except solving problems, and puzzles.  It's a wonderful compass, and your relationship with challenges and puzzles improves every time.<p>About 'highly paid because it's crappy work':<p>The work doesn't get any easier.  You get better. At everything. Including your own attitude.  If you don't it's easy to say it's boring or unfulfilling.  Even greater challenges will await you in whatever you think is perfect, so you'll have to learn the same skills of pushing through to find learn and do what you need. As a byproduct sometimes you end up being that person who took 5 years to learn to recognize what you need to do in an hour.<p>Everything is crappy when it's either growing out of control, or it's a startup about to fail, or a unholy codebase.  You will be guaranteed crap. There is no smooth sailing, ever.  The sooner that kind of kool-aid goes out of circulation, the better. Your ability to deal with realities to make and leave it better is an important skill to always work on.<p>My journey so far has taken me through .NET and J2EE at the same time, and many other languages and frameworks. I am doing a lot of web and mobile stuff now, but I get to back it up with experience in hardware, networking, sys admin work, complex datacenter hosting of critical apps. Full cycle ERP (ie., SAP) installations. Custom middleware to speak between any combination of legal, workflow, shipping, accounting, logistics, retail, and beyond.  The common pattern: writing web software to replace desktop software when it seemed unnatural, kind of how mobile-only apps get that feeling today.<p>Was it boring? Maybe if I wanted to complain that it was really hard. If it seemed like it at first, but then it became one big puzzle that no 20-something had any business doing.  Now, I want to keep doing things that I have no business doing.<p>At a certain point, you can not abstract away the fact that it will take lots of work no matter how good and amazing the tools are.  One thing gets easier, something new will pop up.<p>My expertise is being able to be thrown down any well and coming out time and time again.  It attracts more wells. My  specialty is pulling together a full-stack to solve what others can't seem to figure out.\nOver time you do get known as someone who can solve things and you get hired for figuring things out -- not any particular language or technology you know.<p>The only skill I paid attention to learning was learning to take good care of my customers in their terms, not my lofty explanations trivializing them and their feelings.  The first business model I was taught by a consultant who eventually handed most of his customers to me for web/app/IT development was this:  Start with 10 customers who can pay you $1000/month, who are on the upswing, and  grow with them by delivering more value than you're paid (help them grow and they spend more with you forever).<p>Sometimes, one or two customers made up way too much of my income and you learn to adjust it if it's important to you.",1370115948

5805530,comment,5804016,5804016,1,0,gojomo,,,"The EPI study keeps misleading people. Key points to remember:<p>(1) The EPI is a unionized-labor think tank with strong anti-immigration views. Its research – its selection of figures and spin – will always be in service of that goal.<p>(2) This latest EPI report, like a similar one before it, uses industry-wide and degree-wide averages with no adjustment for cohorts of experience/age. It is thus possible for the 'average' to go down if there is an in-rush of new younger workers (or equivalently, less-experienced career-changers at starting salaries).<p>As a simple contrived example, assume an 'industry' starting with two workers, a entry-level worker at $50K a year, a senior worker at $100K a year. The average is $75K.<p>A year passes. Business is booming and there's a shortage of well-qualified workers. The senior worker gets a raise to $125K. The now-junior worker gets a raise to $62.5K. The company would like to hire more senior stars, but they're all already doing well in other industries (or other countries and deterred from working domestically by immigration barriers). Still, the sector is growing so they hire two new promising entry-level workers at $50K each, one recent graduate and one career-switcher, who were both making just $40K last year in non-STEM work. Maybe one of them will be a domain-specific star, with salary to match, once trained-up in a year or so.<p>Every single person in this scenario got a 25% year-over-year raise... but the 'industry average' compensation dropped from $75K  to $71.9K, split over a larger and earlier-in-career base.<p>If you live in the simpleminded, interchangeable-STEM-laborer world of the EPI analysis, this is a crisis. There are plenty of ""STEM workers"" because every ""STEM worker"" is just like every other ""STEM worker"" and the new entrants haven't magically started making the old $75K average simply by putting on a STEM-worker-jumpsuit. But really, everyone's doing better, the industry <i>is</i> talent-constrained and responding with <i>both</i> salary increases and legally-allowed hiring, and would be able to expand more if other truly 'senior' industry-skilled people were available.<p>(3) The EPI report uses wordcrafting like ""[f]or every two students that U.S. colleges graduate with STEM degrees, only one is hired into a STEM job"" to create the impression many STEM graduates are left without a desired job. But there's plenty of evidence (including in their own report) that STEM-graduate unemployment remains low, and lots of workers happily go into non-STEM jobs with STEM degrees, or into STEM jobs with non-STEM degrees. (In particular, many STEM graduates prefer the pay and challenges of other fields – law, finance, consulting, even many sales and small-business roles – and may have taken their STEM degree simply out of intellectual interest, not as strict occupational training.)<p>So the healthy churn of matching of people with jobs where they, individually, thrive gets spun by EPI as implying we have more STEM graduates as we need. They seem to think of a STEM degree as if it were chiefly a 'union card' giving you the right to work in some rationed job role... and if not everyone with these cards takes those jobs, too many cards were issued. Cut back on the STEM worker supply, from schools and immigration, pronto!<p>That's the kind of fixed-pie, world-oblivious analysis that did wonders for the big-three US auto industry... don't let the EPI port that thinking into the high-tech world.<p>We need as many smart, trained workers - from schools <i>and</i> career-changers, foreign <i>and</i> domestic – as we can get.",1370114592

It got us noticed and got us some funding, so now the chips are down and we have to prove we can do it again!<p>Our biggest need in the short term is a UX designer with strong graphic design skills to help us shape the look and feel of CodeRunner:2. You will have an amazing amount of influence over the visual style and user experience. We really need someone who can take a project from vision to reality in a short amount of time, and who has a proven track record of working closely with a team in a highly collaborative environment. In the early stages we will need someone who can be on site most of the time. This role will start as a contract with the potential to work into a full-time position. You can find the original job posting here:<p><a href=""http://www.rocketchicken.com/2013/05/23/mobile-game-ui-designer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rocketchicken.com/2013/05/23/mobile-game-ui-desig...</a><p>In the more medium term, we need to find a server engineer who has a lot of experience with web services and scalable database systems. Ideally you'll be well-versed in both SQL and NoSQL solutions and can help us assess our requirements to identify the best solution. This game is going to rely heavily on a pretty sophisticated server back-end, so you'll be right in the middle of building what we think is going to be the coolest mobile game ever. ;) This is a full-time position:<p><a href=""http://www.rocketchicken.com/2013/04/02/experienced-server-engineer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rocketchicken.com/2013/04/02/experienced-server-e...</a><p>And if you're not interested in these positions, but want to see what CodeRunner is all about, check out the web site here:<p><a href=""http://www.coderunnergame.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coderunnergame.com</a><p>Thanks!<p>Ryan",1370114139

However, I believe we have a finite window of opportunity to make a number of critical scientific and social advancements in order to continue our species' progress in the next few centuries and beyond. This window is defined primarily by the availability of materials and energy which are necessary to support technological development at our current scientific frontiers. Increasing population, especially in the developed world, consumes resources faster and thus shortens the span before many critical materials become scarce. Better extraction and synthesis will likely become available in the future, but first we need to get there.<p>I am not arguing that we shouldn't have children at all, but responsibly limiting our population seems like a critical supporting factor in any qualitative advancement we want to make as a species.

""Kind of tired"", ""don't trust them"", ""mostly fantasy"" - these seem like oddly agressive phrases to me which probably reflect personal anguish rather than a desire to see the facts.<p>If we take the $300K+ figure as an outlier, what I see are pretty much peaks at around where I get LinkedIn spam telling me I can make $x.  [Edit: to clarify, by ""peak"", I am referring to peaks if you were to plot the responses in a histogram, not a dollar amount.]  I'm going to guess which peak someone is likely to fall in varies with factors like years of experience, when you entered the workforce, how often you changed jobs, luck or whatever.  Then I see a significant amount making more and a significant amount making less.  I don't think that's all that unbelievable.  I don't think it makes sense to overemphasize that the poll is informal and not scientific - the poll still tells you <i>something</i>, even if not really that much, so why dismiss the messenger?<p>This reminds me of when I lived in Seattle, worked for MSFT and used to read ""Mini Microsoft"" threads around bonus/promo time.  People would post level/base/bonus and how they were evaluated.  That too was unscientific, but the company was pretty standardized around titles and how well you could do at bonus time, so it didn't take much to figure out that most of the data was probably accurate - and seeing that, even if it was totally unscientific, served as a reminder of how the place worked and where you fit into it.  But then you got a lot of commenters who I think were bitter, jealous, or in denial that it was possible that the guy down the hall was doing better than them.  So in a reactionary fashion, they start attacking the other posters, calling them liars, non-employees, whatever.",1370113438

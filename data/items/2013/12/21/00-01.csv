Sorry about that, everyone else.<p>Why can&#x27;t you try to get something nice for the &quot;going rate&quot;? And how does money not enable you to make just about any place nice? Use any remaing lack of niceness to fuel your lobbying for affordable housing being built. Not that I want to pick on <i>you</i>, but:<p><i>Of course it&#x27;s extremely easy to say, the heck with it. I&#x27;m just going to adapt myself to the structures of power and authority and do the best I can within them. Sure, you can do that. But that&#x27;s not acting like a decent person. You can walk down the street and be hungry. You see a kid eating an ice cream cone and you notice there&#x27;s no cop around and you can take the ice cream cone from him because you&#x27;re bigger and walk away. You can do that. Probably there are people who do. We call them &quot;pathological.&quot; On the other hand, if they do it within existing social structures we call them &quot;normal.&quot; But it&#x27;s just as pathological. It&#x27;s just the pathology of the general society.</i><p>-- Noam Chomsky<p>Just because people are poor, i.e. defenseless, doesn&#x27;t mean others should be able to have their home automatically. You might as well say &quot;when I ride on a bus that is very full with mostly strong people, I have to pull an old lady from her seat, so I can sit somewhere nice&quot;.

That&#x27;s why you probably are pretty sure that you were born by your mother. If you want to know the same thing about our sun, you look at any number of the 100 billion or so stars in our galaxy which are in all kinds of different stages of their lives to correlate how stars commonly tend to come about - and your best guess is, again, that the sun probably happened similarly to other stars with similar observable properties.<p>BTW, I think this is a good demonstration of your misunderstanding of how science determines probable causation: Have you ever been to a magic show? Your model of causality would mean that you would not be fooled by any of the tricks (if you could observe actual causation, you would notice the lack of causation between the misdirection and the effect). The fact that you (probably) are fooled is evidence that you do actually use the principles described by dragonwriter, you just aren&#x27;t quite aware of it.<p>Or in short: If you are interested in this, you really should read a bit about the philosophy of science. People have spent a great deal of effort on figuring out this stuff and all the fallacies that you haven&#x27;t quite thought through yet.",1387587453

A lot of things he said were not well though out. Here are some examples.<p>- He claimed that tail recursion could be seen as the essence of functional programming. How so?<p>- He complained that tail recursion has problems with debugging. Well, tail recursion throws away stack information, so it should not be a surprise. You don&#x27;t get better debug information in while loops either. And you can use a &#x27;debug&#x27; flag to get the compiler to retain the debug information (at the cost of slower execution).<p>- His remarks about Hindley-Milner being bad are bizarre. Exactly what is his argument?<p>- His claims about pattern-matching are equally poor. Yes, pattern matching does some dynamic checks, and in some sense\nare similar to reflection. But the types constrain what you can do, removing large classes of error possibilities. Moreover, typing of patterns can give you compile-time exhaustiveness checks. Pattern matching has various other advantages, such as locally scoped names for subcomponents of the thing you are matching against, and compile-time optimisation of matching strategies.<p>- He also repeatedly made fun of Milner&#x27;s &quot;well-typed programs do not go wrong&quot;, implying that Milner&#x27;s statement is obviously non-sense. Had he studied Milner&#x27;s ￼&quot;A Theory of Type Polymorphism in Programming&quot; where the statement originated, Bracha would have learned that Milner uses a particular understanding of going wrong which does <i>not</i> mean complete absence of any errors whatsoever. Milner uses a peculiar meaning, and in Milner&#x27;s sense, well-typed programs do indeed not go wrong.<p>- He also criticises patterns for not being first-class citizens. Of course first-class patterns are nice, and some languages have them, but there are performance implications of having them.<p>- His critique of monads was focussed on something superficial, how they are named in Haskell. But the interesting question is: are monads a good abstraction to provide in a programming language? Most languages provide special cases: C has the state monad, Java has the state and exception monad etc. There are good reasons for that.<p>- And yes, normal programmers could have invented monads.

6945028,comment,6943469,6944991,2,0,api,,,"&quot;where is the &quot;true activism&quot;?&quot;<p>I think that&#x27;s a complex question.<p>The simple reason: I think most of the people with real grievances are too busy trying to make ends meet. Meanwhile people with financially underwritten agendas and/or trustafarian types who don&#x27;t have to work have plenty of time to dominate the conversation.<p>But there are deeper issues too. At one time those so-called &quot;trustafarian&quot; types <i>did</i> campaign for workers&#x27; rights, higher wages, etc. Now they mostly campaign for trendy eco issues and other ideological issues that have little relationship to reality and no relationship to the plight of the poor. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s intentionally constructed or a product of some sort of breakdown in social communication, but that seems to be the way it is.<p>The cynic in me says this: in reality these people hate the poor. The poor are dirty, uneducated, and worst of all often harbor conservative/religious social values. Moreover empowering the poor and raising their standard of living is in conflict with environmental goals of reducing resource consumption. Who wants to use more energy and land and what-not just to take care of a bunch of rednecks and brown people? That&#x27;s why activism today is basically a LARP where overprivileged mostly-white children of baby boomers try to re-live their parents&#x27; glory days and where trustafarians with dreads try to show off their street cred to get laid with cute hippie chicks. That&#x27;s why they pick trendy issues that don&#x27;t help or in a few cases might actually hurt the poor (e.g. limiting new construction).<p>I think there&#x27;s a bit of truth in the cynical view unfortunately.<p>What&#x27;s the solution? For starters, I really think people should ignore &quot;activists&quot; that have no skin in the game. Ask yourself if they really know what they&#x27;re talking about. Are they actually affected by the issue? If not, they may well be thrusting themselves into an issue for reasons that have more to do with fashion statements and scenesterism than genuine concern or well-informed efforts to improve anything.<p>Take GMO foods for example, an issue I&#x27;ve repeatedly used as an example of a trendy LARP-protestor hobby horse. I <i>do</i> take protestors of GMO foods seriously when they&#x27;re farmers that have been wrongfully sued for patent infringement by biotech companies, and I group that under the whole problem of patent law abuse and patent trolling that also affects the software industry. So there are people who protest GMO foods that ought to be taken seriously. But the yuppie larvae who are convinced they&#x27;re going to kill us all because some quack web site says so? Fuck them. They&#x27;re just clogging our informational arteries with irrelevant fear-mongering bullshit and detracting from the <i>real</i> issue at hand.<p>So let&#x27;s say we do that. Ignore the LARPers, but listen to the victims of IP law abuse. That leads us somewhere the LARPers never do, namely somewhere productive and empowering, since it means that those farmers can and should make common cause with those who campaign against software patents. Now we have something that has real political meaning, a real coalition to actually get something meaningful done that can help real people.",1387584672

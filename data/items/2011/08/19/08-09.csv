2902729,story,,,6,2,angerman,"Ask HN: Hourly rate for freelancer (in Germany)?",,"Hi there! I'm trying to gauge in what range the hourly\nrate in euro should be for freelance jobs.<p>I've recently graduated and hold something like a\nmasters-equivalent (German Diplom) degree in\nmathematics with a minor in computer science \nfrom a renowned university. I've been tinkering \nwith various programming languages since my childhood\nbut decided to study math because that looked more\nlike a challenge to learn new things I wouldn't\notherwise learn.<p>Background: The company that I worked for as a\nstudent does not want to hire employees and would\nlike me to work for them as a freelancer.\nThis obviously puts the burdon of security,\ninsurance, etc. on me.\nOn the other hand it gives me more freedom, which\nI would really enjoy; and it would open the door to\nother clients.<p>The tasks would primarily include mobile application\ndevelopment, currently only iOS, some PHP, making\nestimates for projects and what ever comes up and\nneed solving (it's a software agency in it's infancy).\nPresumably I could also get project and personnel\nresponsibility in the not so distant future.<p>I've been repeatedly told that I am very valuable to\nthe company, and I would judge at least my iOS\nexpertise way above theirs. Yet I think they try to\nget me at a ridiculously low hourly rate.<p>Which is why I'd love to get some pointers in which\nrange I should expect/set the hourly range. I won't\ndisclose the current offer they made, as the negotiations\nas still ongoing, but it's about at least 10eur away\nfrom what I'd expect.<p>Any input would be very much appreciated. Thanks!",1313744388

Unfortunately, incompetent is typically used in a far more derogatory manner by most. Thus, I fear most people reading your post will take as a synonym for stupid.<p>But even with that clarified, I'll still disagree. The first 3-6 months of starting a business often involves a lot of busy work. This is not coding or otherwise requiring of immense thought, but it does take time. A great many business owners have said that it requires long hours to get a business up and running.<p>Of course, that does not apply to regular employees. Nor should it remain constant after you've started. Even so, heads of companies often do spend longer hours working than most. That's not to say their lives are unbalanced.

If the entire week is very busy, it's the weekend when I'll send the long, thoughtful pieces of e-mail. When people come in Monday morning, they'll see that I've been quite busy they'll have a lot of e-mail.*<p>Working long hours is not <i>always</i> a sign of incompetence or lack of process. It still depends on the situation, and what you do in those hours. I do agree with a weaker statement, <i>it shouldn't be that the majority of your employees always have to work long hours</i>.",1313743827

The Xbox 360, GameCube, Wii, and Playstation 3 are pretty much all based on those same designs (although the PS3's CPU has crazy after-market modifications which really didn't work out so well).<p>The same can be said about phones and portable video game systems. It's all ARM CPUs with Imagine GPUs. Android, iOS, Windows Phone 7, Blackberry, webOS, Nintendo GBA/DS/3DS, Sony Vita all use the exact same chips from the same design firms.<p>The big hardware differentiator is what cost/performance balance you want to strike. Newer architectures with newer manufacturing processes cost more plain and simple. And there is a spectrum of other off the shelf components to round out the package.<p>There can be some play in getting more out of a design with engineering tricks or getting better components at the same cost with economies of scale. Or you can corner the market by buying out the entire manufacturing capacity of the best components to deny your competitors (or vice versa). But it's pretty much you get what you pay for.<p>Nintendo builds hardware two to three generations behind to save a lot on costs. Not because it doesn't know how to get something faster and better. The upcoming Wii U is basically an older PowerPC CPU with an older ATI GPU. If Nintendo wanted, it could create a crazy powerful console with a $1000 CPU and dual $600 GPUs that nobody would buy. All it needed to do was tell IBM and ATI what it wanted. It wasn't a matter of engineering that steered them away, but a matter of economics. Which if you remember right worked great in the short term for the Wii. But as everyone already knew wasn't a long term play. Hence the earlier-than-everyone-else release of the Wii U.",1313740997

Its suboptimal speed and the fact that it's really easy to write Java code that can be used from Jython means that you'll probably use it more as a scripting language\n* The relation between IronPython and .NET is probably very similar\n* For CPython, people have always wrapped their favorite C library and started using it - with SWIG in the old times and nowadays with Cython, which is a compiler for a subset of Python extended with types. In fact, quite a lot of useful Python libraries use Cython (whether as a glue language or as an implementation language), and it's probably in production use at a lot of places.<p>One of the problems of PyPy is that, while targeting Python-the-language, it also gives up CPython compatibility by using their own PyPy VM (in the sense of, GC'd execution environment with a JIT that's not really compatible with other C/C++ code or even CPython). Because they're targeting their own execution environment, they cannot profit from either the plethora of C/C++ libraries that exist or even the very decent library support that exists on the JVM.<p>The PyPy people have recognized this and started to take care of the affair with a JNI-type version of CPython's ctypes library. The problem is that very few library wrappers (or even non-Python CPython extensions) are based on ctypes, so that it's not useful as a replacement for CPython for most of the people (especially those that need the speed improvements).<p>The reluctance of PyPy developers to start thinking about a solution for all the existing CPython extensions has severely limited the appeal for using PyPy in production use - having 10x gains for new code is not all that appealing once you realize that you need to rewrite the other couple thousand lines of (C++ or Cython) code and hope that you can optimize the PyPy code as well as you optimized the C++ or Cython code.<p>Having said that, I'm really excited by the idea of a Cython variant that can be used to wrap C/C++ code (or use Cython code) in PyPy's execution environment. (This is the GSoC project that was referred to earlier) Or even if I could use Cython to compile my C/C++ Python extensions for the JVM or .NET.",1313740991

It is really hate of assertiveness, and since people try to avoid what they hate, they'll become less assertive and less likely to be successful like Mark.  Then, instead of most being like Mark, like we should be, we'll continue to get solitary Marks, and the hate will increase - thus we have a vicious cycle.<p>This problem is endemic in academia, and most other social settings I can think of where most people feel impotent, such as high school and socialist countries.<p>That being said, I am solidly on the side of the herd.

So, the programmer will look dumb to others.  The same applies to his use of the word lazy.

People who are 1 person companies living job to job, hoping they get paid on time.  We need to know what the impact of his policies will be on the individually owned Chrysler Dealership in Iowa. The bodego in Manhattan. The mobile phone software startup out of Carnegie Mellon. The event planner in Dallas. The barbershop in LA. The restaurant in Boston.""<p>No fair adding the word ""tech"" to the original article, then criticizing it for the word ""tech"". :)<p>A ""small business representative"" is exactly what the article calls for. And the article isn't calling for this person to know about their industry, but to know about <i>small business</i>; the pressures of mandated paperwork on a one-person operation, tax pressures, basically all those things that come up when you're too small to have or afford an HR department and dedicated finance staff. The US Federal government, being the single largest entity on the planet AFAIK, has a bad habit of forgetting that paperwork isn't free; the cognitive costs alone when it isn't your <i>job</i> to fill out the paperwork correctly (with steep fines for errors in some cases) can be significant, even before we discount time. (For example, consider your taxes; even moderately complicated individual taxes won't take that much of your calendar year, but the cognitive costs can be daunting. And that's what an <i>individual</i> is expected to pay...)",1226201709

Cuban is not arguing you stick a lone group of tech entrepreneurs in Obama's advisory board.

In general any company that works online right now would benefit more from the order of magnitude increases in productivity that great programmers bring. The jobs he describes are all managerial (the stats guy less so), and as such require communication - which means that at best, they're going to bring incremental improvements. Obviously those get magnified by the staff that reports to them.

The temperature-driven mobility of the hydrogen contained in the hydride controls the nuclear activity. If the core temperature increases over the set point, the hydrogen is driven out of the core, the moderation drops, and the power production decreases. If the temperature drops, the hydrogen returns and the process is reversed. Thus the design is inherently fail-safe and will require minimal human oversight. The compact nature and inherent safety open the possibility for low-cost mass production and operation of the reactors.</i><p>I'm sure a Google search or Wikipedia search would net you more.",1226200960

So, the enlisted both don't have to risk their lives, and they don't have to worry about red tape.

358020,comment,357075,357801,0,0,yters,,,"To save you a read, the gist is that the leaders of ego driven companies do not have an interest in making sure the company succeeds when they leave.  In fact, it is the opposite, since a spectacular failure shows they were indeed geniuses in being able to hold it all together.  Likewise for giving others the important decisions they need to learn to be leaders.<p>But this problem is much larger than just the business world.  In my other readings and observations, I've noticed a similar trend.  According to Rashid's ""Taliban,"" the Taliban succeeded despite themselves.  Their culture is so caught up in ego that they are pretty much incapacitated without a strong leader to hold it all together, consequently they are constantly splitting and fighting with each other.  We also saw this in the leadership vacuum left by deposing Saddam, and is partially why it has taken so much work to get an Iraqi army going.<p>In general, I see this in most non western cultures, at least that I know of, so I suspect it is a common aspect of human nature: principle based leadership outperforms ego based leadership.  This is reinforced by another book I read, ""Why the Rest Hate the West.""  The enlightenment marked a very important shift in social structure: from societies based on relationships to principle based societies, such as law, strict national boundaries, a common language and currencies - the American constitution being the epitome of this approach.<p>However, I qualified this as being more general to western culture, since the Greeks, and then the Romans, took a similar view of law and culture.  For example, see Sophocles' ""Orestes"" or Virgil's ""Aenaed.""  I guess the Enlightenment more marks a truly rigorous and global application of this idea.  If you want a more contemporary example, just look at what kind of culture perpetuates the ghettos vs the culture that perpetuates the more successful segments of America.  At any rate, I'm pretty convinced that cultures based on principle vs personality are much more successful.<p>So, all that is to give credence to the idea that ego driven companies are an evolutionary dead end, and give myself a link that I can refer to for future discussions.",1226200125

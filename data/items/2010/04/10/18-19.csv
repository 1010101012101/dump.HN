IBM competes directly in this market with what used to be AS/400 and System/390 (not sure I know what they're called now, afaik iSeries and zSeries).<p>This isn't really about technology, it's about convincing these enterprises that it's better for them to scale vertically on a single machine than to scale horizontally on commodity hardware. From a technical point of view this has long been proven false, but for certain companies it may be true from a business point of view: if technology is a cost center (i.e., it's called ""IT"" not ""R&D"") and you don't have the talent needed to operate a cluster of commodity hardware (e.g, there are either no operations engineers who can program in your geographic area or they simply won't want to work for you) leasing/buying big iron (especially if it comes pre-configured and with a support contract) starts to sound attractive.<p>Even if SPARC is superior hardware, the customer simply wouldn't care. It would be more profitable for IBM to cut SPARC off and continue only with POWER. The professional services involved in this is the lucrative part for the vendor.<p>People who <i>do</i> care about technology, have in-house talent and do HPC (scientific computing, machine learning/data mining, Internet companies with scalability problems) are best served by x86_64 (in almost all cases excluding some types of computation), ia64 as well as IBM's own Power-based 1U/2U servers (what used to be the RS6000 series).",1270925416

Except, the SDK is two major versions old, v.7 instead of v.9.<p>So for many platforms, you're SOL for hardware acceleration. Do I have it completely wrong?",1270922857

I love math and would be considered by most to be a decent student, but just looking at those problems gives me a headache, and never have I encountered a circumstance in which carrying out those types of calculations by hand was remotely necessary.<p>I will note that the memorization quote is particularly true with more abstract topics where definitions are crucial to understanding ideas and writing proofs.",1270922611

It took some time to see some logic to the ISP POV, which I think the article doesn't do justice.<p>Forget for a moment any notion of fairness or the traditional arrangement of customer > ISP > Internet as a whole. Take a look at the arrangement in terms of value transfer (give) and extraction (take).<p>The consumer-oriented ISPs give network connectivity (and maybe some other ancillary services such as an email account, anti-virus, NNTP, etc.) and take money from customers.<p>Google gives content (search may be more important to users, but content such as video is the focus in this case) and takes eyeballs on ads.<p>There is no formal connection between Google and the ISPs. There are two important informal connections: 1. Without Google (or other similar entities), the product of the consumer oriented ISP would be much less valuable to the customer. 2. Without the ISPs, Google has no way of giving its content or taking its eyeballs on ads.<p>At present, the ISPs perceive an asymmetry in revenue between [them and the consumer] and [Google and the consumer]. They are interested in connecting the dots from Google to the ISP in a more formal way. The only question is who has more to lose by pursuing their point.<p>Google can't take value from the customer without the ISPs. The ISPs' will offer less value to the customer without Google. Will an ISP without Google provide enough value to the customer to justify operating that way?<p>The relationship between each entity is not totally unfettered. The regulatory environment must also be considered. If the ISPs annoy the customers too much, there may be regulatory change (such as Network Neutrality, etc.). This in of itself may be good or bad for the ISPs and their complaints and threats regarding Google may be a diversion for the purpose of increasing their government supported monopoly power.",1270922540

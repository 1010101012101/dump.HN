In the UK we don&#x27;t need to refrigerate our eggs at the point of production (or spray them with chemicals) because our chickens and eggs are much healthier due to superior and more sanitory production methods than those prevalent in the USA. And so eggs are almost always sold at room temperature and usually refrigerated at home. And, as others have noted, the UK is not synonymous with Europe.",1405328307

All the others have relatively small FIFO buffers and require the CPU to do all the I/O work. So you could attach an ethernet interface to one of the SPI buses, or bit bang a few GPIOs but surely the CPU load is going to be painful?<p>Edit: Oh wait, there&#x27;s a main SPI bus that can do DMA as well.

8030096,comment,8029695,8029987,5,0,userbinator,,,"> A platform with less legacy crap than x86 is wonderful for learning about OS development. I don&#x27;t know how the Pi fares for this, with Broadcom&#x27;s chip and all, but if I had the free time to hack an OS in my spare time, not dealing with all the thirty year-old cruft nor shedding a gazillion EUR on a PowerPC system would be ideal.<p>Actually I&#x27;d say the x86/PC is probably one of the best-documented and most stable platforms out there to learn on at the moment, precisely because it has been around for so long. Largely due to Broadcom policy the Pi is notoriously closed and proprietary at the hardware level, and unless there is somehow a massive amount of reverse-engineering like what happened with early home computers (which were better documented so the process started more easily), or a datasheet leak, the situation is unlikely to change. Any of the other open ARM devboards in the same price range would also be good candidates for OS development, but not the Pi.",1405328105

Personally I think a profound focus on scoring well on test is shortsighted. while I do think it is important to learn basic math and languages skills I think it is equally important to learn to think and learn to learn. For some reason children are treated like they are similar to one and other while later in live you are able to choose different types of schools with different interest and different ways of learning.

I definitely appreciate this chance to talk with you.)<p>------------------<p>ARE they something that can&#x27;t be thought of and selected separately, though?<p>I personally don&#x27;t like that kind of thinking. It&#x27;s similar to adding DRM to programs so that it stops pirates- just replace &quot;DRM&quot; with &quot;branding uniformity&quot; and &quot;pirates&quot; with &quot;competitors&quot;.<p>Instead, if someone was truly interested in being an obnoxious competitor, they would &quot;crack&quot; the &quot;DRM&quot; by forcibly separate the branding. Read this in a TV advertisement voice: &quot;Rock with Cydia Substrate, ALL of the Cydia extensions, but none of the slow!&quot; &quot;Replaces the installer, keep the plugins!&quot; Sounds a bit familiar, hm? The end result is still the same, just like with piracy.<p>If anything, this may be worse. It pollutes your own brand, and if issues comes up, you can be blamed even more for stuff that wasn&#x27;t your fault.<p>By keeping the code modification clear, you definitely would be able to better advertise to the Android side of things, and perhaps have other benefits with the current jailbreak community. You are in the unique position of being the only core jailbreak dev where all of the code that they ship doesn&#x27;t need to be completely replaced every jailbreak. Unfortunately for other jailbreak devs, due to this, people have established an &quot;everything is replaceable&quot; mentality.  People can clamor to kick devs out of the scene, like I0n1c. Cydia is not completely immune: if people think it is just a store and a frontend for APT, then people will think that almost any competent programmer can replace you- this is bad! By giving Substrate the individual brand that it deserves, and advertising the difficulty in building such a live code modification platform, it becomes that much more important in consumer&#x27;s eyes.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t care about the average jailbreak community member (seeing some tweets with death threats over not releasing something fast enough... make such a perspective all too understandable), the thing is that the next person to come along to compete will originate from this jailbreak community. Marketing a stronger brand to emphasize the irreplaceability of Substrate may only gather more respect and benefit you in the long run.",1405327189

The technology that makes up trucks, warehouses and servers may be commoditized, but the ability to own and operate hundreds of millions of dollars worth of them, with enough profit to keep growing the fleet every year - that&#x27;s a very real barrier to entry because customers like getting their purchases the next day or even the same day, and doing that consistently for many customers requires that kind of a fleet.<p>On top of that, you need a way to reach customers online.

Perhaps blackra1n or older, in the iOS 1/2 days, when people installed Cydia side by side with RipDev&#x27;s Installer. My memory is pretty hazy on that. At any rate, this distinction is mostly a historical footnote at this point.<p>----------------------------<p>Anyways, I understand that from a practical perspective, it is impossible to separate Cydia-the-installer-and-store and Cydia-the-code-modification-platform. The former pays the bills, while the latter is the focus of most development effort and center of the jailbreak ecosystem, but not profitable without killing said ecosystem. As such, it probably would be foolish to ask to distinctly separate the app and platform code-wise, as people would aim to compete in the somewhat profitable storefront side- Rock is a good example, as mentioned. Again, I understand how you said <quote>It isn&#x27;t about &quot;these things are overly coupled&quot;, it is &quot;these things are effectively coupled but don&#x27;t look to be&quot;.</quote><p>However, if I may: I would suggest you do a branding clarification to clarify, if not separate, the Installer and the Code Modification side of things. For people who aren&#x27;t as familiar with the scene, it would probably help people understand what you do for the jailbreak community better.<p>As it is, the naming scheme for the entire ecosystem is pretty confusing. For non-jailbreak-devs, &quot;Cydia&quot; is seen as a platform containing just the APT-frontend installer app and the store; the code modification/extension side of things is less obvious, eclipsed by the installer. This is possibly part of the reason why some people are interested in competitors for Cydia: if it is only seen as a glorified app store storefront and installer, almost anyone can write a replacement, which may be the cause for discontent.<p>This also has the benefit of clarifying what you&#x27;re trying to do for Android: the brand &quot;Cydia&quot; is very iOS-centered at this point, and perhaps distinguishing Substrate/etc as something else, more neutral, would be a good idea.",1405325389

Neither your &quot;skipping&quot; technique, nor (partially) using an on-screen-keyboard will help against that.<p>Using a second factor for authentication provides some extra security, but a well-configured trojan might intercept your logout request, display a fake logout confirmation and store your session data for their botmaster to peruse.<p>If you need to regularly use untrusted machines (and have access to usb ports or a cd drive), you could bring a hardened browser with you. That should defeat most &quot;Man-in-the-Browser&quot; tricks. Or, even better, a live CD or USB drive. At this point, you should still assume your keyboard and screen to be compromised, but the OS should be safe enough to cautiously use.",1405325277

8029970,comment,8029882,8029882,1,0,BozeWolf,,,"I knew this already, but when I heard this I was amazed about the eggs being washed in the US. I heard this at a factory which creates egg-sorting-machines (If you want to see awesome egg handling machines: check this [1].)<p>For the US they created a special module to wash the eggs. In the Netherlands (where I live) this is unheard off. Even at moba they where like WTF :)<p>Another fun fact is: our eggs are stored outside the fridge in the stores, but in many house holds the eggs are stored in the refrigerator. Most refrigerators have those plastic containers for eggs. Same goes for cheese. Cheese shops store the cheese outside the refrigerator, a lot of households put it in the refrigerator again.<p>What also strikes me, is the fact that in big parts of europe, having so many chickens on a m2 is not allowed anymore. Instead of laying houses we have free-range systems. It&#x27;s quite funny technology (like washing eggs) has to solve a problem which didn&#x27;t exist if we respected nature just a bit more.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=moba+egg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=moba+egg</a>",1405325125

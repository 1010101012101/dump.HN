This is the core of the book being reviewed, and I saw my values in it. I live in a small apartment, and could have more space if I wanted, but my sense is that I would then have more stuff. And while I want technology to serve as extension of me, I know I don't need more stuff.<p>On the second read, I latched on to the evolutionary angle. I thought about how much I like Jared Diamond writings, and how cool it would be to have a better understanding of the evolutionary mechanics underlying consumerist tendencies. I thought of Mad Men, and the historical arc of marketing and consumption.<p>On the third read, I saw it not as a book about consumption, marketing or evolution.

But one also has to consider:  Is the mere fact that one considers things to this depth a symptom of the curse of the foreigner in Rome?  Would I be less frustrated if I started caring less about what others think?  Is it possible to go through life happy as a foreigner in Rome?

My friends and I spend a lot of time in clubs and parties (some of them own clubs so it's nothing new to them), so when we go out we tend to spend more time in the lounge areas than at the bar or dancefloor.

Many of them are similar to Sinatra for Ruby (if you are familiar with that framework) and basically allow you to create very simple web applications in a single file if that is what you desire. While these are not inherently MVC, they can be used as the underlying foundation for your very own MVC framework.<p>As for MVC, the other big ones for Python (other than Django) are Pylons and TurboGears. Of course there are some other very heavy weight ones as well, such as Zope and Plone, but my knowledge of these is very limited, so I'll leave them for someone else to comment on.<p>Finally, you can could always use the WSGI spec directly and just slap together all the other ""best of bread"" pieces to make your own simple framework. It's actually pretty easy to do so, and the best tutorial I've found on doing just that is on Joe Gregorio's website (<a href=""http://bitworking.org/news/Why_so_many_Python_web_frameworks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitworking.org/news/Why_so_many_Python_web_frameworks</a>).

I don't think this is easy to fix. I've sort of ""solved"" the problem by living in the Bay Area. There are a lot of hypernerds, and a lot of wild and creative people who love to party, and a significant number of people who are in the intersection.<p>You'll never completely escape the problem, though. One of the blessings and curses of the modern world is that you can develop interests that make you very different from your geographic peers.<p>The one thing that you really MUST do is stay away from people or activities you have contempt for.

Reading a book is usually harder, more immersive and, if the author is good, usually feels like a dialog.<p>What books exactly probably depends on yourself.

Richard Dawkins's older books, Marvin Minsky, Hernando de Soto, Jared Diamond, they all deserve to be read in full.<p>I also caught up with some professional books I somehow missed, like The Mythical Man-month or Peopleware, and I found a fascination for cognitive psychology with The Wisdom of Crowds and Predictably Irrational.<p>Yup.

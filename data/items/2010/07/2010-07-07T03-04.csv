There is a Taoist story of an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years. One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit.<p>""Such bad luck,"" they said sympathetically.<p>""We'll see,"" the farmer replied.<p>The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses.<p>""How wonderful,"" the neighbors exclaimed.<p>""We'll see,"" replied the old man.<p>The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune.<p>""We'll see,"" answered the farmer.<p>The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son's leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out.<p>""We'll see"" said the farmer.",1278472378

A common example of this is when you spend 18 hours trying a dozen solutions to a very hard problem, with none of them working. At the end of it all you tend to feel like a failure because nothing worked, but in reality you went through the very necessary process of narrowing your solution space and learning about the problem.<p>I guess in general our emotion mechanisms misfire a lot.",1278472251

Maybe you're fearful enough of that possibility that you'll never post on the forums again. And maybe the forums are so important to you that you'll quit WoW without them. Those are perfectly legitimate ways to act, and I'm not arguing otherwise. As you said, it's your choice.<p>What I am saying is that it's not an <i>invasion of your privacy</i> for Blizzard's forums to be based on RealID; they are not ""bad guys"" for doing so. In addition, many people feel it's next to impossible to have reasonable discussions in the forums as they are right now, where otherwise-reasonable people create anonymous accounts for the sole purposes of trolling and spamming.",1278472109

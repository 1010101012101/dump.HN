Yes, but not without significant work. And then, unless they are as committed to making their product awesome as the webhook.com team is, they&#x27;ll always be looking over their shoulder. E.g as webhook.com internationalizes, etc.<p>Is it likely someone would try that in the English-speaking market? I just doubt it.

There&#x27;s plenty of examples where at least a core product is open source under very liberal open source licenses, but a company behind it sells support, services, extensions etc around the open source core product. I think that at least companies are more interested in buying your services around the product (guaranteed support response times, customization, training, ...). However I mostly know infrastructure tools which follow this philosophy (e.g. Vagrant, Chef, puppet, various database products etc...).",1422539876

This is exactly the kind of thing that people used to (rightfully) castigate Microsoft for & it&#x27;s predictable but depressing to see Google treading the same path. (I know &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; was just a slogan, but there was a time when Google stood for the principle of winning simply by being better than everyone else & it&#x27;s saddening to see them resort to these kind of underhanded tactics to force their products into the marketplace.)<p>These kind of tactics do work in the short term of course, but ultimately they have a corrosive effect on your long term success because users cease to trust that you&#x27;ll treat them fairly.

Unlike many, I do understand the sensitivity of meta data and social graphs, and I deeply care about it.<p>It is obvious to me that transparency has all the benefits over privacy. It&#x27;s a simpler way to think about and understand the world, it&#x27;s easier to implement and maintain, and it&#x27;s much more efficient.<p>Transparency is the way it should be. Privacy is just a band-aid, a patch, a set of arbitrary workarounds that in no way fights the underlying problems, if any there are. If anything, privacy only contributes to the increasing reliance on privacy that&#x27;s expected of us. By keeping information secret, you encourage others to think it should be, and some people eventually are lead to believe that some things should inherently be secretive, without understanding why that is.<p>Do you really want to live in a world where you must constantly worry about your every steps, your every words, your every interactions? Do you believe it is sustainable to build systems that are 100 times more complex and inefficient as they should be just because you want to remain anonymous? Do you embrace the fact that people who are better manipulators/liers will always have an edge in a society that encourages privacy, since they can control what they decide to show the world? Do you realize that a system that&#x27;s based on the assumption that secrets are kept secrets is much more fragile than one that&#x27;s not, as secrets are becoming increasingly more difficult to keep? Do you not realize how much value and opportunities we miss now that people were tricked into believing that privacy is necessary? Bitcoin, Google Glass, geo-tracking anything, health record analysis, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t want to hide anymore. I don&#x27;t want to compete with liers, or be tricked by them. I don&#x27;t want to password-protect all the things. I don&#x27;t want to browse behind 7 proxies. I don&#x27;t want to be explicit about everything that could be implicitly inferred through tracking. I don&#x27;t want to keep secrets anymore.<p>Fortunately, I soon won&#x27;t have to. Transparency will thrive, and privacy will die. My only worry is, how far and deep will people like you go into making society rely on and expect privacy. The deeper you go, the more brutal the transition will be the day the choice is no longer yours.",1422539670

Even then I don&#x27;t see how it doesn&#x27;t fit in the OSI definition...<p>The AGPL is an open source license: you give people access to your source code and they&#x27;re free to modify it and redistribute it as long as the code stays under the same license.<p>The main (only?) difference with GPL is that providing a service based on AGPL code is considered the same as redistributing the software so you can&#x27;t make proprietary changes to the code and say &quot;but I&#x27;m not redistributing the code, I&#x27;m only running it on my own hardware so I don&#x27;t have to make the source code available&quot; as you can with GPL code.

SC&#x27;s use of Mu doesn&#x27;t detract from this either---both Mu and GHC implement Haskell-the-language (to a large degree) and the core benefits they speak of are exactly those within Haskell-the-language.<p>Now, SC needed some extra advantages: portable code seems to be a big one as well as dramatic cross-compatibility. These are compiler features more than Haskell-the-language features and so they wrote Mu.<p>I think the point about Erlang is awesome. I think Haskell could learn <i>a lot</i> from Erlang... and frankly also improve upon its safety and readability tremendously using types. That&#x27;s a personal bet.<p>I don&#x27;t think Dialyzer is even a slightly acceptable replacement for the language advantages of Haskell, however.

Attorneys spend most of their time on the facts of the case.<p>In law school, most lawyers are taught to present each argument in a standard format called IRAC: Issue, Rule, Analysis, Conclusion. The issue is like the question presented on the front page here: &quot;can courts pierce the corporate veil where a corporation has misappropriated funds?&quot; ROSS spits out the relevant rule, and any information it can find on how to interpret that rule in specific situations. However, this is only the beginning of a lawyer&#x27;s job. The largest part is taking that rule and actually applying it to the facts of the specific case. ROSS doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to do this, yet. Finally, and least importantly, the lawyer comes up with a conclusion (or a series of probability-weighted conclusions). ROSS doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to do this either. In law school and in court, it&#x27;s not enough to cite the rule of law. It&#x27;s much more important to apply the reasoning of the rule to every specific fact in the specific case.<p>It would be very interesting to see this intelligence applied not just to legal research, as here, but to e-discovery, which is the other time intensive task given to associates and contract attorneys.  That would, I think, be the next step into turning this into a general purpose attorney that _would_ be able to handle the analysis and perhaps conclusory stage of a legal issue.<p>If anyone who worked on ROSS is here, where did you purchase your corpus from? West or lexis? How are you doing shepardizing and pruning of bad law?",1422539206

8965998,comment,8964451,8965268,0,0,JackC,,,"There have been some important efforts to make the law more accessible in the last, say, 50 years. E.g.:<p>* Jury instruction have been rewritten using the minimum number of terms that jurors won&#x27;t already know.<p>* Legal decisions are written to be more readable to contemporary laypeople. (At least they seem that way to me -- it&#x27;s a little hard to tell given the change in writing styles generally.)<p>* Uniform legal codes have refactored the law to make it more consistent state-to-state, and to remove complexity when for example two causes of action could be reduced to one.<p>* Property law (which probably moves more slowly than others) has moved away from centuries-old &quot;magic phrases&quot; that could break inexpertly-written deeds.<p>But all of this is basically syntax. It makes the system easier to learn, but doesn&#x27;t reduce the fundamental complexity of the model.<p>And you <i>can&#x27;t</i> reduce that complexity much, if you want a system that is &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;just&quot; at scale. &quot;Fair&quot; meaning that it treats like cases alike, and different cases differently. &quot;Just&quot; meaning that it mostly comes to what most people consider the right outcome in individual cases.<p>The scale here is hundreds of millions of people over hundreds of years, any two (or more) of whom can interact in a way they want the law to settle. Treating all of those cases &quot;fairly&quot; means at least one of: already having a rule that roughly guides the outcome for a given dispute (statutes and regulations), or taking into account the decisions other people came to in similar cases in the past (caselaw). Treating the cases &quot;justly&quot; means those rules and analogies have to be fine-grained -- if one of the parties points out a special circumstance in their case, and most people would feel that it should change the outcome, then it needs to be taken into account for the system to be just.<p>So law is complex because the potential interactions between hundreds of millions of unique individuals are complex.<p>You might want to reduce complexity by reducing the reach of the law, but I don&#x27;t think you can reduce it that far and still have a recognizable society. For example, many libertarians would prefer a system with greatly reduced criminal law and commercial regulation -- but where the government still enforces contract and property law in a way that is predictable and fair. The system for fairly, justly, reliably, predictably enforcing the contracts entered by hundreds of millions of people over hundreds of years is going to be complex -- the same kind of complexity we have now.<p>Obviously the situation could be better or worse -- the stuff I listed at the top are small examples of how it&#x27;s gotten better. Making the system (say) half as complex would be great. But it wouldn&#x27;t fundamentally change the problem space, or make tools like Watson unhelpful for solving it.",1422538778

Due to the inverse square law, it&#x27;s incredibly inefficient, laughably so. It would be like trying to use smoke signals to communicate across oceans. A beam of light would be more efficient. But the beam would be instant and you could never &quot;listen in&quot; unless you were physically at the location of the target.</i><p>A &quot;beam of light&quot; is governed by the inverse-square law every bit as much as\nradio signals are, both being propagating electromagnetic waves. It might be\n&quot;laughably inefficient&quot; (compared to what, though?), but it seems to be what\nwe&#x27;re stuck with. &quot;Perhaps advanced civilisations use magic to communicate&quot;,\nis what you&#x27;re basically suggesting. Well, maybe they do. Ultimately, we can\nonly search for ETIs with the physics we actually know.<p>So, you&#x27;re right to say that Fermi&#x27;s &quot;paradox&quot; (always a bit of a misnomer)\ndoesn&#x27;t <i>prove</i> the nonexistence of ETIs, but you can&#x27;t wave away\nfundamental physics because it gives an uncomfortable answer, either.<p>I also wanted to note in passing that it&#x27;s a bit funny to obsess about\nefficiency and then throw out a statement like &quot;maybe they communicate with\ngravitational waves&quot;. The state of the art gravitational wave detectors are\ntargeted at finding signals generated by the merging of pairs of\nsupermassive black holes at cosmological distances, and possibly neutron\nstar or black hole mergers at galactic ones. If a civilisation is capable of\nsmashing black holes together to send signals out a few megaparsecs, I would\nsubmit that efficiency is the very last of their considerations. Gravity is\nmuch, <i>much</i> weaker than electromagnetism.<p>Indeed, there are a lot of reasons to think that radiofrequency\ncommunication would be preferred. The galaxy is largely transparent to\nradiation at the hydrogen hyperfine transition at 21cm, a very useful way to\ncut through the crap and dust of the interstellar medium. By contrast, at\noptical frequencies the extinction from our environs to the galactic centre\nis about thirty-five magnitudes, roughly a loss of 10^14 in signal power.\nRadio receivers are relatively inexpensive and cheap to make and operate.\nThe Arecibo dish itself could communicate with a similar setup thousands of\nparsecs away. Probably more now, after the receiver upgrades from a few\nyears back.<p>But you&#x27;re right that we shouldn&#x27;t focus on radio communication with ETIs to\nthe exclusion of everything else. Some folks have been discussing &quot;optical\nSETI&quot;, looking for laser/maser signals whilst piggybacking on other\nobservations. The SETI folks aren&#x27;t stupid. But they&#x27;re not well-funded,\neither, and they do what they can.<p><i>They&#x27;re not like radio waves where you can listen in. That&#x27;s actually the\nvery reason why they&#x27;re so inefficient, they&#x27;re broadcast omnidirectional\nand that takes a lot of power - wasted power.</i><p>Radio dishes are not in any sense omnidirectional. They have a beam pattern\nwhich dictates the sensitivity of the instrument as a function of distance\noff-axis.

Our experience has been the following:<p>+ An open-source version that folks can download, install, and trial is a great way to get your software in as many hands as possible. However, that&#x27;s also more work for you: if folks download your software and it doesn&#x27;t install / has bugs they can&#x27;t troubleshoot, you&#x27;re providing a very bad experience, and that will reflect badly on your commercial offering.<p>+ Research your market first. In our case, it&#x27;s increasingly difficult / unpopular today to provide developer / IT tools that aren&#x27;t open-source. In other words, being open-source is becoming a requirement.<p>+ Open-source offers reassurance to enterprise customers who might not have considered your product otherwise (you&#x27;re small, and they don&#x27;t want to tie their success to your survival, but if your product is open-source, this concern is more limited). There again though, it depends on who&#x27;re selling to.<p>+ Our product hasn&#x27;t been forked / used by a competitor. This wasn&#x27;t really ever a concern. Note that we&#x27;re following a model where we do open-source releases on a 3/6 month basis (we don&#x27;t develop in the open); that&#x27;s a reason, too.<p>+ We <i>did lose</i> several prospects to our own open-source software, but we also <i>acquired</i> several customers who transitioned from the OSS edition to the commercial edition. the only incentive at this time to choose the commercial edition instead of the open-source one is &quot;support and more frequent updates&quot; (which is good, but not always enough to get prospects to sign you a check). Before you decide to open-source your product, think very hard about how you&#x27;ll differentiate your open-source and commercial editions (options include delaying updates, differentiating on features, support...).<p>+ Most of our revenue is now coming from the commercial single-tenant edition, whereas it used to be the SaaS edition. This happened after we pivoted to the enterprise, and made it much easier to deploy your own Scalr installation (it used to be a pretty daunting task).<p>+ We&#x27;re not getting that many contributions (probably largely because of the model I mentioned above), and because so far we haven&#x27;t had the energy to encourage them. In other words: just putting your product out on GitHub doesn&#x27;t mean some folks from the internet will suddenly start working on it for free. That just doesn&#x27;t happen. We did get a few very-well-thought-out bug reports, though!<p>Ultimately, I&#x27;d conclude with saying that open-sourcing your product is a solid way to get more attention. However, it&#x27;s also more work: you&#x27;re creating a competitor (your own product) that you must somehow beat in deals, all the while making sure that that competitor is solid enough that it doesn&#x27;t turn people off your product.<p>Hope this helps!<p>You can reach me at thomas@scalr.com if you have questions you think I could answer!<p>----<p>One last thing that isn&#x27;t stricly-speaking sales related is people. We have an open-source culture here at Scalr, and there are employees (including myself) for whom that matters a lot.",1422538397

This meant they could charge Lux VAT instead of the customer country&#x27;s VAT rate.<p>This obviously gave them an unfair advantage not only over local businesses but also non-EU businesses that used the VoES system.<p>In effect these new rules change little for non EU businesses. The VoES system is being retired in favour of the new MOSS system which is effectively the same sort of thing, only now, ALL businesses including those in the EU, have to charge local VAT when selling digital services to the EU.<p>For e big companies like Amazon, this closes a loophole. For those who were correctly charging VAT under the VoES system, nothing much changes. For those non-EU companies who were chose not to comply with the 2002 rules, well I&#x27;d imagine they will continue to not bother. And those who were ignorant of them (many I&#x27;m sure) might now be a bit more aware.<p>But of course the businesses it affects the most are small EU businesses who now have to charge different rates of VAT or use MOSS when they didn&#x27;t before.",1422537666

If you do, please let us know what you liked/disliked, what worked and what blew up.  There&#x27;s no guided installer, but it&#x27;s not too hard to get running in most cases.

For example, if you have a time tracking software, a good portion of your clients are probably not strong technology companies. In this case, open-sourcing it, while continuing to develop it, could create an excellent open-source project that is maintained through paying subscribers.<p>A few examples:<p>OpenStack[0], is a huge open source[1] cloud operating system. Rackspace runs on them. They&#x27;ve fostered a huge community, all through original backing by Nasa and Rackspace[2]. Essentially, OpenStack is now used by Rackspace to fund their for-profit business, while OpenStack is being actively developed by thousands of people.<p>Sidekiq[3] is an background job processor, that sells a pro[4] version on top of the open source library. This pro version provides additional user functionality at a cost, allowing funding for future development of the open source library.<p>Essentially, both these platforms use open source to sustain for-profit businesses, and both had a long term plan for <i>why</i> they wanted to open source a big part of their business. While I think a lot of planning needs to go into open sourcing it, it&#x27;s definitely sustainable and doable.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.openstack.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.openstack.org/</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Getting_The_Code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Getting_The_Code</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack#History</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://sidekiq.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sidekiq.org/</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://sidekiq.org/pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sidekiq.org/pro/</a>",1422537103

So, JACK2, for example, won&#x27;t be able to place its dbus service file in a location that the dbus service natively knows about.<p>In many cases situations like this can be fixed by setting environment variables, but in some cases more patching is required to make this work properly.<p>EDIT: I don&#x27;t consider this a serious disadvantage, though.  It is not unusual for packagers to patch software in other distributions.  (I dare you to check out spec files for popular RPMs.)  It&#x27;s just something a package maintainer has to think about under some circumstances.<p>I should also note that I&#x27;m surprised at how little patching is required for most software (besides the common shebang patching).",1422537084

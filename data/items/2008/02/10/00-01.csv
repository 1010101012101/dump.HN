I don't see how this keeps OCaml ""from being a first choice for server-side development"" while making it an acceptable language for client-side development, though.<p>There are a several hackish polymorphic print implementations, but the best solution so far seems to be the ""deriving"" camlp4 extension (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/deriving/wiki/Introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/deriving/wiki/Introduction</a>). This looks pretty good:<p><pre><code>     type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | Branch of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree\n	 deriving (Show)\n     \n     type point = { x : float; y : float }\n	 deriving (Show)\n     \n     let points = Branch (Leaf {x=0.0;\n				y=0.0;},\n			  {x=2.0; y=2.0},\n			  Branch (Leaf {x=1.0; y=1.0},\n				  {x=1.0; y=0.0},\n				  Leaf {x=0.0; y=1.0}))\n    		      \n    Show.show<point tree> points\n    =>\n    ""Branch\n       (Leaf {x =0.; y =0.}, {x =2.; y =2.},\n	Branch\n	  (Leaf {x =1.; y =1.}, {x =1.; y =0.}, Leaf {x =0.; y =1.}))""</code></pre>",1202604113

112834,comment,111841,112478,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... Since 'cat > foo.py' erases foo.py, you are obviously lying about that error message. ...""</i><p>True this syntax erases the file. But all I did was cut+paste the example from the original source & added the source code encoding on posting.  I knew the example code missed the encoding and I  checked the example text for extra unicode characters (another possible source of errors) as I saved to the file & checked with cat. So I tried the example on the CLI before I posted and overlooked the redirection.  It's not worth lying, way too many sharp people to pick you up. Just a simple display mistake.<p>Btw, the inference I'm lying. Does that also apply to the original author as well?<p><i>""... Some time later ...""</i><p>Doing a bit of digging. It appears the <i>'cat > foo.py'</i> works like this ...<p><i>""... Redirection of output causes the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for writing on file descriptor n , or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified. If the file does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size. ...""</i> [0]<p>So my theory is you have tried this with a full file & it has erased itself.  Thanks for the pick-up though. It is a fine distinction and something I've not come across before. We are both right but at different times.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wlug.org.nz/bash%281%29Part5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wlug.org.nz/bash%281%29Part5</a>",1202602522

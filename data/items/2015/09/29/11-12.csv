What I want, is roughly: start with the route, smooth it so that the original route still wiggles on the final map (eg <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93...</a>, then interpolate with splines)<p>Simply using straight line distance to the curve won&#x27;t work, places can be the same distance from multiple points on the route (unless you divide space up as in the article).<p>So what I thought of instead was, treat the smoothed line as a charged wire, and map POIs as opposite charges. Electric field lines do not intersect, and if a POI &#x27;charge&#x27; is allowed to fall towards the &#x27;wire&#x27;, the distance it travels and the place it lands give me coordinates. These calculations are relatively straightforward (see eg <a href=""http://lampx.tugraz.at/~hadley/physikm/apps/linecharge.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lampx.tugraz.at/~hadley/physikm/apps/linecharge.php</a>), and I never need to figure out a closed form for the transformation, which I guess would be horrendous.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;d call this coordinate system; it bears some similarity with isobaric coordinate systems in meteorology though.<p>Edited to add: these things are called &#x27;strip maps&#x27; in the literature btw, there&#x27;s a survey of examples here: <a href=""http://www.geovista.psu.edu/publications/MacEachren/MacEachren_ALinearView_86.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geovista.psu.edu/publications/MacEachren/MacEachr...</a>",1443527059

And they execute on difficult projects more effective.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way: 10X engineers ship 10X better products. Some places still use the daft metrics you mentioned (LOC, bugs squashed, etc.), sure. I&#x27;d assume that a gig such as Twitter would know that a 10x engineer is identified by, essentially, gut feel and can&#x27;t be quantified. There seems to be two definitions of the meme and I&#x27;d assume that most people around here would refer to the more realistic one (10X better products).<p>More facts of the 10X meme: not every engineer is necessarily 10X on every project you might assign them and, as you mentioned, a 1X hire could end up being a 10X engineer some day.<p>Back to the article. An EE team isn&#x27;t the only way to approach this. We&#x27;ve got at least two where I work:<p>With enough 10Xs around sometimes you just need to let them fly: give them a little freedom to fix shit, take their fixes seriously and trust them. There&#x27;s a good chance that if something annoys an engineer enough, they will take their own initiative and fix the shit (sometimes in their own time). This is the approach that my team lead takes - he&#x27;ll give us the time once we can prove the value of our changes.<p>Another team lead I chat to a lot logs tech debt the very instant that it is created and allocates time every release to remove tech debt. His tech debt backlog is rapidly approaching zero. The advantage here is that his junior engineers learn the cost of tech debt and learn how to make the correct decisions to fix it as they are involved with removing it. An EE team with 10X elites provides no knowledge sharing.<p>An EE team might not work everywhere (especially for us: our product could be seen as a collection of products), the most important take-away from that article is that tech debt can be solved with a little responsibility and by granting your employees enough autonomy to figure out how to solve it.",1443526628

10295524,story,,,1,0,estitesc,"Teespring (YC W13) Is Hiring Senior Full Stack Engineer",,"What does our team do?\nEverything from a compelling experience for buyers, to a feature-rich platform for sellers, to a backend manufacturing pipeline to fulfil orders. At Teespring, “full stack” means anything from warehouse management systems to our 3rd party API to the number crunching analytics behind our campaign dashboards. It’s up to you to pick the challenge which excites you the most!<p>What is the job?\nWe take code quality and engineering efficiency seriously. Engineers pair about 50% of the time, and we have a robust but lightweight code review process to disseminate knowledge. Nothing goes to production without automated testing. We do 2-week sprints, with engineers&#x27; input a key part of the planning process. Your expert input will also be considered when planning new feature work: both in terms of implementation decisions, and product experience.<p>Who is the ideal candidate?\nA passionate programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are a definite boon, since many features have some user interface component. Deep, professional experience with Rails will be especially useful. A person with strong opinions, weakly-held.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now:\nYour team-mates will look to you for technical advice, guidance, and mentorship. You will have architected and led the creation of a significant piece of the team’s technology. Our collaborative environment and generous training budget will have substantially enriched your technical abilities.

A big push towards CD and SOA at the moment.<p>What do we offer?\nHappiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive: working with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams. Medical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, and pet. Unlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays. Generous stock options. Free (delicious) catered lunch and dinner daily. Fully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar.

10295509,comment,10293793,10293793,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Been thinking about this subject for a long time, for very personal reasons.<p>Capital punishment exists so that people don&#x27;t go get guns and kill lunatics that have done them harm. For some crimes, only being told &quot;We&#x27;re going to kill him&quot; holds the social fabric together.<p>It&#x27;s not justice, it&#x27;s not fair, and it&#x27;s a terrible way to run things. One could make the pragmatic argument that if you&#x27;re going to have a death penalty, then hanging them outside the courthouse the day after the trial is the way to do it. Otherwise you&#x27;re just making a mockery of trying to be fair -- which this was never about in the first place.<p>When you see somebody kill his family and then say &quot;I deserve the death penalty&quot;, when you see families torn apart by evil who demand that the criminal must die, when you see people who are never going to be anything but killers being set free to kill again? Even though you might be against the death penalty, it&#x27;s pretty obvious why it exists.<p>So I&#x27;ve given up fighting against the death penalty. These things move in cycles. Another 50 years we won&#x27;t have one and people will be clamoring for one again. Instead, I&#x27;m extremely pissed about what pg mentions in closing: prosecutors playing hardball with plea bargains.<p>Whatever you want the laws to be, I&#x27;ve seen enough prosecutorial misconduct over the last decade to last several lifetimes. The vast majority of the time they&#x27;re doing a great job. But 1-10% of the time the public is getting screwed. The incentives are all wrong and oversight in nonexistent. I&#x27;ve seen them cover for bad cop decisions, screw over aaronsw, refuse to take DNA evidence that would release innocent people from jail -- the list goes on an on. Something is really rotten and needs to be fixed.<p>Even if you believe in the death penalty, you have to admit that the criminal justice system is so broken that it&#x27;s way beyond a reasonable doubt that we&#x27;re executing people we shouldn&#x27;t. The system needs fixing. Not only will this save lives, it will result in many people either not going to prison or serving much less time than they currently are.",1443524538

After he is done flipping, he will look at the flips that immediately followed an outcome of heads, and compute the relative frequency of heads on those flips. Because the coin is fair, Jack of course expects this empirical probability of heads to be equal to the true probability of flipping a heads: 0.5. Shockingly, Jack is wrong.&quot;<p>But actually Jack is right. Here are all the possibilities. A &quot;streak&quot; means a head was followed by a head, and a &quot;break&quot; means it was followed by a tail.<p><pre><code>          Streaks Breaks\n  TTHT    0       1\n  TTHH    1       0\n  THTT    0       1\n  THTH    0       1\n  THHT    1       1\n  THHH    2       0\n  HTTT    0       1\n  HTTH    0       1\n  HTHT    0       2\n  HTHH    1       1\n  HHTT    1       1\n  HHTH    1       1\n  HHHT    2       1\n  HHHH    3       0\n  total   12      12\n</code></pre>\nThe paper&#x27;s argument later is more complex than the first paragraph implies, putting the sequences in groups with fixed numbers of heads. I don&#x27;t see the point of that but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help.<p>They get into some math, but just counting the cases doesn&#x27;t seem to support their argument at all. If anyone can explain their argument in a simple way, I&#x27;m interested.<p>If they&#x27;re really confident in this, they should go to Vegas, find a high-rolling gambler, and start betting on coin flips. After each heads, offer 55/45 odds that the next coin flip will be heads. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be hard to find takers.",1443524497

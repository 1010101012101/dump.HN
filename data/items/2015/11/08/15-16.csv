If people aren&#x27;t employed, how exactly do they buy enough things to keep capitalism working?

At some point, you&#x27;re going to see at least some &#x27;smart&#x27; robots say &#x27;hang on, why are we working for nothing for these people?&#x27;, at which point they get another worker rebellion on their hands.

10528811,comment,10527428,10528679,0,0,mbrock,,,"Nice to hear.<p>I had similar moments of epiphany while taking a course on abstract algebra and writing down some theorems in the form of Agda definitions.<p>As you may know, Agda is a Haskell-inspired language that has an even more powerful type system that makes it possible to define arbitrarily strong types, so that for instance you can define the type of a function that sorts a list—and then know confidently that any implementation of that type does indeed sort a list.<p>Anyway, when learning Agda, one comes across the notion that programs and proofs are in some sense the same thing. In other words that the code for a function can be read as a proof that the type of that function is inhabited. This seemed to me kind of bizarre and magical at first...<p>The more I thought about it, the more it made real sense, and not only that, it helped me understand proofs in a much more intuitive way. Before, if you had asked me what a proof is, I might have said &quot;it&#x27;s a very strict way to argue that a statement really is true.&quot; I didn&#x27;t know that such proofs can be given formal structure... I couldn&#x27;t really explain how to relate it to programming or functions...<p>But now that I&#x27;ve to some degree internalized the notion, if you ask me what a proof is, I might say it&#x27;s an unambiguous description of how to transform an input into an output.<p>If you call the input P and the output Q, then P is a premise and Q is a conclusion, and the proof is the &quot;arrow&quot; P -> Q that through some well-defined sequence of &quot;truth-preserving transformations&quot; gives you knowledge of Q assuming nothing but P (and some fundamental axioms).<p>And in the world of programming, P is an input argument and Q is a resulting value, while the &quot;arrow&quot; P -> Q is a well-defined sequence of correct transformation that produces a Q-value given only a P-value (and some fundamental primitive functions).<p>So in this sense you can say that the implementation of a function is actually a kind of logical argument.<p>If you want to make use of this insightful connection (the &quot;Curry-Howard equivalence&quot;), however, your programming language needs to be pretty strict. If your P -> Q argument suddenly throws a null pointer exception, it&#x27;s not much of an argument—it means your claim of being able to produce a Q given P is false.<p>This connection really helped me to understand both proofs and programs in a deeper way.",1446998352

My only point was what anyone&#x27;s reaction should be when their personal impression is &quot;bad pedagogy&quot;, in any area of software.  It means that something is missing.<p>The idea that I&#x27;m &quot;obviously referring to Haskell&quot; and attacking me for it is beneath a response.<p>By the way this thread is an <i>excellent</i> example of why if I did have clear arguments for limitations baked into technology xyz, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t share them: leaving learners in the difficult position of being presented difficul material/approaches, without a context, by those who understand it but keep mum about any limitations or difficulties.<p>(An example would be the syntax for standard library container operations in C++ (stl things), like with vectors.  Nobody is going to explain that this syntax is so much uglier than higher-level vector/array syntax due to history, because the minute they did it would become obvious that there should be a CoffeeScript-like intermediate syntax parser that turns easy syntax into C++.  Instead, it&#x27;s presented without any such context, and nobody fixed the fact that this is harder to learn, harder to parse or debug, and more error-prone, than higher-level interpreted languages.  It&#x27;s just silently accepted without reference to this being a historical design   trade-off.<p>I&#x27;m not objecting to it, but if something <i>seems</i> to be described circuitously or not being taught very well, then you&#x27;re probably not being told the whole story.<p>There is a good and specific rason why.)",1446998327

I always thought it&#x27;s a concept from the weakest parts of marxism. But besides that, it&#x27;s an increasingly ethereal concept.<p>In Marx&#x27; day, you could think of &quot;means of production&quot; as land, factories & tools mostly. At least, thinking of it in these few concrete terms related very closely to most of the economic activity around you. In a communist society, workers own the factory and farmers own the land, fairly concrete. Marx then suggests (as I said, I always though it was very weak) that a proletariate state would just own all means of production and workers in general would own it. So, he breaks from the simple and concrete concept pretty quickly. Still, at least you can picture what you&#x27;re thinking of.<p>But in today&#x27;s world, what is Google&#x27;s &quot;means of production?&quot; What&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s? HSBC&#x27;s? Disney&#x27;s? Uber&#x27;s? Uber is more fiction-made-matter than a bunch of &quot;capital.&quot;<p>I find it surprising. I mean Marxism/Communism/Socialism has other concepts that I think are more relevant and less contrived that I&#x27;m surprised we don&#x27;t hear more about. The idea of historical progression seems appropriate given the rate of change we see today. The Marxist revolutionary concept that when the majority don&#x27;t have a stake in the status quo, revolutions happen... that seems relevant given the trends in inequality.  Global solidarity.<p>At least &quot;labour power&quot; isn&#x27;t making its back way into general political vernacular.",1446998179

Let&#x27;s go with $1700 for the calcs, to keep it conservative.<p><a href=""http://ece.berkeley.edu/facstaff"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ece.berkeley.edu/facstaff</a><p>so, ($3,400 * 12) / .15 = $272,000 a year.<p>There may be cheaper options, but seriously, fifteen percent sounds very low even for two income well paid families.  And of course, at such an ultra wealthy income bracket, tax breaks have phased out far lower in the income scale.<p>Another way to look at it is $3,400 * 12 = $40,800.  Let&#x27;s assume a 20% tax bracket (assuming one spouse makes a good income and intends to keep working), so it costs you $51,000 to go to work vs staying home.  Even if you don&#x27;t strictly lose money by working, that second income has to go way up before it&#x27;s really worth it.<p>There is one other factor, of course, which is career continuity.  It may make sense to work essentially for 20% of your pay if it means that in 5-6 years, when the kiddos are older, you can rejoin the workforce at a higher income level, rather than trying to break in after an extended absence.  Also, my numbers are a worst case scenario, where you have two small children in daycare at the same time, though of course spacing it out comes with a different set of problems.<p>Add in the sky high cost of housing, and you can see how hard it is to raise a family in the bay area now.  The best bet is actually to have one <i>very</i> high earning spouse (medical or nursing specialist, higher echelons of law or finance, some upper tech or managerial positions).  $200k+ a year is a very different picture if it is all earned by a single spouse.  Alternatively, for two very high earners (again in that 200k+ range), the percentage spent on childcare and basic housing starts to diminish to acceptable ranges.<p>This is also why, ahem, I don&#x27;t take claims of a labor shortage in SF seriously at &quot;six figure&quot; salaries if the salaries are barely above 100k.",1446997820

Makes the article&#x27;s argument seem even less thought out as the author didn&#x27;t even do some basic calculations.<p>But this slightly different system I&#x27;m describing isn&#x27;t the same as what we currently have. What I&#x27;m thinking is UBI (or whatever it might be called in this system) vs. wages. Pick one. This would automatically make the minimum wage > $30k, probably at least around $40-50k and wouldn&#x27;t require paying every adult in the US, including ones who already have jobs. The key difference is that people would have a choice of going to this new Semi-UBI system anytime they wanted, no questions asked, with guaranteed income. I think that&#x27;s one differentiator. Another differentiator would be removing the countless barriers that exist in today&#x27;s systems. The many idiotic rules around welfare and Medicaid for example are so complicated and require so much time and paperwork, it&#x27;s ridiculous.

If you think about it, capitalism along with the industrial age are only possible because of and have been subsidized by fossil fuels. By subsidized, I mean that this increase in productivity is a simple conversion of energy from fossil fuels to products and services many of which we don&#x27;t really need. The industrial age is basically the usage of cheap and readily available fossil fuels. But that also has had a great cost to our environment and this is an implicit cost that has been ignored.<p>Furthermore, in this modern age most advances that we&#x27;ve made tend to be zero sum. For example the advances that we&#x27;ve made in health-care tend to be nullified by modern cronic diseases, like diabetes, obesity, heart diseases, allergies or cancer. And why do these happen? We live in really crowded and polluted cities of course. And many scientists have been warning us for example about the &quot;western diet&quot;, a diet consisting of mostly corn, soy, animals raised from corn and mono-cultures raised with pesticides and transported thousands of miles before reaching consumers, which is basically what you get when industrializing our food chain. And we may have access to education or information, yet we are burdened by debt, we are none the wiser and we are probably not happier. The only real advances we&#x27;ve made as a species has been in the form of individuals rights, which have been eroded lately in the name of security.<p>So personally I&#x27;m having a hard time lately seeing what&#x27;s great about it.<p>> <i>Capitalists may not feel comfortable with workers owning the means of production, but they will have to make some concessions to society (example: single payer healthcare, free education, basic income, something else?) in order to maintain a healthy stability.</i><p>Capitalism only works if the means of production is not concentrated in few hands. Once that happens, then the whole system goes crumbling down because who is going to pay for those products and services? The people that are on a basic income and that are also paid by those with the means for production? No, that&#x27;s not going to happen because it doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>More realistic would be to say that we&#x27;ll end up with a handful of masters that have billions of slaves.

Defining functions and functional composition laws is done (and is a perfectly natural thing to do), at the beginning of any undergrad math class. The definition of functions and composition laws was done more than a full century before category theory.<p>Category theory was invented for a deeper reason - to have a rigorous definition of a natural transformation, to enable a precise language to translate back and forth between algebra and topology.<p>Note that this is not a comment about the usefulness of category theory in theory of programming languages, it is about the uselessness of the linked article in talking about it.<p>As another commenter pointed out, in practice Haskell functions as values don&#x27;t even form a category.

It&#x27;s made me think about my current path and somethings I have done/learned that has incrementally pushed me towards functional programming over a long window of time.<p>I have played with Scheme, along with a half-completed SICP read through. I have also played with Haskell, along with partial read throughs of LYAH and real-world Haskell. Those experiences, although incomplete, have been important to me as a programmer. I don&#x27;t think those actually &#x27;sold&#x27; me on FP though.<p>I took a detour for some time and decided to become a better programmer using OO methodologies. I used TDD, I memorised SOLID and all that. Read up on design patterns and then used them practically. All well and good. From my toying with Scheme, Haskell and associated literature, I wasn&#x27;t entirely satisfied. The code I produced was always a bit, I&#x27;m not sure, but not entirely satisfiying. It looked and worked better than what I get given to review when considering freelancers for an extra pair of hands - part of that is because of PHP I think. I carried on this way for a while in any case.<p>In my own self-learning, I&#x27;d started looking at language design and compilers. I read some books and decided I didn&#x27;t have enough mathematical skills to consume the texts. I turned to learning discrete mathematics. That was a big eye opener. As I was reading about formal logic, set theory, proofs, etc, my mind kept turning to the problem of applying this in my work. Haskell and FP came to mind too. I believe doing this helped it finally click that a functional approach can be taken successfully in most of the work I do.<p>Whilst I was doing this, I had a fairly simple project that, if designed correctly, could make my life easier in future projects. I took an OO approach, designed the UML, started writing tests, etc. I decided that it was over-engineered or at least it was a lot of work for what I was trying to do. I decided to take an FP approach. I had the project completed with far less code that I was happier with. In the same language. That was almost like an &#x27;epiphany moment&#x27;. I started getting seriously interested about functional programming then. I am now starting to see the flaws and bloat in the approaches I was taking before.<p>I recently read Out of the Tar Pit again. I had read it before but I didn&#x27;t really get it. This time it excites me and made my brain whir with ideas. Especially on how I can make these approaches compatible with the constraints of my day job.<p>I actually now digest as much as I can about FP. Haskell, as an important player, frequently comes up. After laying the ground work, monads make a lot more sense. Haskell as a language excites me.<p>In my opinion, and I am self-taught when it comes to computers so it may not be 100% applicable, here is what I did to start my transition from imperative to declarative:<p>a) experiment with functional programming. Not actually get it and be ok with that. Carry on down the path.<p>b) Read HN and note articles posted about FP<p>c) Continue learning about imperative programming and consume the advice from OO thought leaders. Apply it to your work.<p>d) Learn a bit about maths and what it actually is, especially realising it&#x27;s not just rote computation and application of algorithms from school.<p>e) Take a functional approach instead of an OO approach within the language you are working with. I did this in PHP. Not only will it show you how FP compares, it will also show you why Haskell/OCaml/etc by way of the deficiencies for FP in your chosen languages. In PHP, the type system (arrays as your Everyman...) and inconsistent type hints, explicit closing over of variables in outer scopes and piss-poor support for modules is one. Biggest is the only way to pass a function in the function namespace is to use a a fully-qualifies string (so function name along with namespace - you get undefined constant otherwise). With Java, it might be that you cannot have stand alone functions, which would suck.<p>This helped a lot for me but I&#x27;m sure spending a long time learning about software down to the hardware in my spare time contributed a lot to this too.",1446995800

Take, for instance, the &quot;slippery slope&quot; fallacy. Which is not necessarily a fallacy, because &quot;doing A will lead to B&quot; is valid if both A and B stem from the same principle C. If affirming A implies affirming its principle C, and if B is related to principle C in the same manner as A, then yes, &quot;doing A will lead to B&quot; is valid reasoning.<p>This is certain value in studying philosophy generally, and formal logic specifically. But it is not a fundamental subject in the same way that most HS subjects are, and it will be of no avail to students who have not already reached a high level of reasoning.<p>The mistake Paul and other technocrats make when calling for &quot;critical thinking&quot; is that they treat it as an actual subject matter. But there is not textbook for &quot;critical thinking,&quot; with which a teacher can instruct a class. It is an intellectual virtue, like curiosity, or honesty. It is not taught directly, but indirectly, through other subjects. THROUGH the constraints and methods of science, one learns to think critically about evidence and causation. THROUGH reading and analyzing literature, one learns to detect intentions, both explicit and implicit, in the voices it encounters. THROUGH algebra and calculus, one learns to think about abstract objects and their relationships.<p>There is no &quot;shortcut&quot; to critical thinking, just like there is no shortcut to teaching children to be responsible or caring or hardworking. It is a skill that has to be practiced in the various arenas of life.",1446995362

4399266,comment,4399108,4399162,26,0,rauljara,,,"I'm someone else who refrains from commenting in order to protect my average karma.<p>The thing is, that it isn't as irrational as you are making it out to be.  Posts from users with higher average karma are sorted higher.  Presumably you are posting because you want your post to be read.  Either you want it to influence people or you want your question answered, or whatever.  If you didn't want it to be read, you wouldn't have posted it.<p>I'm pretty sure this has a 'rich get richer' effect.  On a page full of a lot of comments, most people will only read the first few.  Being at the top leads to more up-votes, leading to more posts at the top, and so on recursively.<p>I am totally guilty of gaming this system.  I normally only post in threads where I think that I'll get up-votes, and I only post things that I think are worth posting.  The latter effect is good.  There are too many people on HN and it's a good thing to encourage us to maintain a high signal to noise ratio.  But the former, the fear of posting in unpopular threads, or on comments near the bottom of the page, is awful.",1345244354

4399259,comment,4399108,4399108,4,0,Terretta,,,"I shudder at the ramifications of some of these suggestions.  Users do what you pay them to do.  For example, paying people to up vote/down vote from New would result in just that -- not in people clicking the links and thoughtfully evaluating the content.  And denoting high karma users more visibly would result in more karma boost activities.  The end result of that is National Enquirer style headlines.<p>There is a change that would probably help: allowing a difference in signaling between agree/disagree and signal/noise.  The definition of up/down voting is closer to ham/spam than agree/disagree, but people tend to use the arrows for agreement instead.  It's hard to behave otherwise, by up voting a well argued comment you think is wrong, for example.  It would be easier to highlight quality if multiple axes were available.",1345244271

4399210,comment,4396591,4399093,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Perhaps when I get a chance to build my own data center for Blekko I'll be able to actually run the experiment [1]. Then I'll have a better answer. But would like to share a bit my reasoning.<p>You are correct that my concept 'threw away' the heat generated by compressing the air. However, since any energy stored at all was collected from a previously unharnessed source (the wind blowing past the data center) it might be more accurate to say that it would not collect all that it 'could'. But here is a very important distinction, the heat from air compression is 'low grade' heat, which is to say the delta between it and ambient is small enough that harvesting it in meaningful amounts is quite difficult. You also need to consider that this thing is operating next to a data center which is running an evaporative cooler 24/7 to pull excess heat from inside the box and dump it into the air outside the box. Basically spending energy to move the heat outside.<p>So from this side of the screen, to accept you point that not capturing the heat generated from compression was 'throwing it away' I would need to have some credible way of utilizing the captured heat.<p>Looking at it from the overall energy exchange picture, you've got the kinetic energy of the wind, with is 1/2mv^2 where m is the mass of the wind moving pass the windmill. Some percentage of that you convert to mechanical energy which runs the air pumps and some of that becomes heat in the bearings and linkages. The mechanical energy then compresses the air which by the ideal gas law goes up in temperature proportional to the change in volume. Just sitting there, the tanks holding the air cool off, losing this heat to the surrounding atmosphere. We could insulate the tanks to keep it inside (and pressures up) but it turns out that we'd like to harvest heat energy out of the data center later so we let this heat leave by convection. The tanks then go down in pressure thanks to that same ideal gas law.<p>So when we use this air, we decompress it inside our data center. This allows heat in the data center to be absorbed by the expanding air, which saves us the energy we would have been using to run the evaporative coolers to pull it out and increases this energy available in the air as it increases that static pressure differential between ambient and the decompressed air. So we 'get it back' as it were, in a positive way. Running it through the engines allows us to then harness the pressure differential, and if it comes out of the engines still 'colder' than the data center air we can inject it right into the regular atmosphere of the data center to offset warm air that is already there.<p>[1] Facebook also has a data center up there in the region and if someone there wants to pick up the ball and run with it that would be pretty cool to. You could write it up for the open compute stuff. Of course you still have to figure out how to get an MDI engine. If Tata ever shipped I considered buying cars, throwing away the body and just pulling out the engines. That would work but requires Tata to actually have a product you can buy.",1345243605

It's typical for startups to offer options with a 1 year ""cliff"" to keep employees from walking away with equity if they don't stick around.<p>Say an early hire is offered 4% equity with no cliff. That means that .083% will vest each month, and that early employee could walk away with  more than tenth of a point of equity after 2 months, likely before they contribute enough value to the company to justify such equity.<p>Startup employees should view equity as a bonus anyway, and make sure they're earning a market rate unless they're earning really significant equity, because best case scenario the equity will be significantly diluted before an exit, and more likely, the company won't make it to exit, and the stock options will therefore be worthless.<p>That being said, if the rumor in the article is true, its still a massive dick move, and it probably also cost the company a substantial amount of money in severance pay.<p>EDIT: It looks like it's Illegal in california (where OnLive is located) to claw back stock options by firing employees without cause [1].

4399131,comment,4397282,4398776,9,0,kbolino,,,"Actually, no you wouldn't.  You'd be able to answer why Alexandra Gelber, Assistant Deputy Chief of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, <i>thinks</i> violence/violent imagery is different than sexual abuse/sexual imagery.  The only citations are to law (both statutory and case law) but in a memo arguing for the justification of the law, citing the law is begging the question.  She does make reference to a number of specific cases, but one could just as easily pick out examples of violent acts being committed by people exposed to violent imagery.  In order to refute the analogy, you must show why the two situations are different; Ms. Gelber makes an effort to connect sexual images of children with sexual abuse of children but fails to <i>show</i> (rather than state) how that differs from the case with violence.<p>Consider the passage you quoted.<p>""no one who watches Saw believes that the images of violence are actually happening""<p>Actually, you do believe it, at least for the duration of the film; the concept is known as ""suspension of disbelief"".  Rationally, you know better, but your mind takes a temporary lapse of its senses for the sake of enjoyment.  That doesn't change the fact that the violence is realistic enough to pass for the real thing.<p>""where in child pornography images, real children are actually being abused.""<p>What about animated images or self-taken images?  There is plenty of content produced that involves no actual depiction of children, nonetheless the abuse of children.  Yet the law seems to state and the courts seem to think, for the most part, possession of images not depicting abuse constitutes the same offense as possession of the genuine article.<p>""Furthermore, what is the point of any pornography if not to stoke the fires of sexual desire""<p>I could just as easily say: what is the point of any pornography if not to <i>satisfy</i> sexual desire?  Since I too am providing no citations for my claim, one cannot objectively state which of our two statements holds more water.<p>I appreciate the contribution to the discussion, but ultimately what we have (as is often the case in such matters, to be fair) is a dispute between opinions, lacking any hard evidence for either position.  Remember that the position is about child pornography/pedophilia in general, so you can't just cite specific offenders; exceptional cases do not a trend make.  Statistics are needed here, but obviously they're going to be hard to come by.<p>Also, even if we take Ms. Gelber's argument at face value, it essentially boils down to: images of child pornography are very highly correlated with acts of child abuse.  If that is true, then I would certainly say it, coupled with the necessary accusations, justifies a police investigation and the issuance of a warrant.  However, I do not believe that makes a compelling argument for the act in and of itself to be illegal.  Sexual abuse of minors is the crime; possession of its depiction is, at best, a minor offense (invasion of a child's privacy).",1345242426

Like it or not.  I'm sure many SEO people use it to get around Google's restrictions.  These are not necessarily uses that infringe anyone's IP.  Twitter is UGC.  And Google caches the entire web, indiscriminantly.<p>Tor, like the 'net itself, is controversial.  It can be used for bad things.  It can also be used for good things.  It could be used to break criminal laws, or to enable copyright infringment.  It could be used to violate TOS that may or may not be enforceable in civil court.  Or it could be used just to evade idiosyncratic censorship by some webmaster that has no legal basis whatsoever.  (This comment itself is being posted through Tor.)  It is, however, any way you look at it, useful.<p>There may be an ""intended purpose"" for Tor.  But as with almost all software, that means little.  Users decide how they will use it.  And that is unpredictable.<p>Did the folks at MIT, when they developed Tor, say to themselves, ""You know, this will be used to commit crime""?  Probably.  But they also probably envisioned some other uses that were of undisputed benefit to society.<p>As someone else said, MIT is still behind Tor.  Grep the source for the Tor client for IP numbers.  You will find that some belong to MIT.  My understanding is that Tor is controlled by a small group (maybe only one person) because like anything else that uses a network, there has to be a bootstrap, a ""root"" that hands out the initial addresses.  And anyone that uses the Tor trusts that root.  Somewhere there is/are a few people with a great responsibility on their hands: they make Tor possible, for better, or worse.<p>More people need to use Tor for non-criminal purposes.  Using Tor as a workaround for censorship, whether it is on HN, or in some oppressed country is to be expected. If you are the censor, and you don't like it, ban Tor.  It is not difficult.
HN does not ban Tor.<p>One of the great myths on the 'net is that an IP address equates to a machine or a customer account.  False.  It represents an interface, which is itself an ephemeral concept.  Interfaces can be created, cloned or destroyed at the blink of an eye.<p>This may all be frightening or it may be exciting, it all depends on how you look at it.  It shouldn't matter whether you are a good samaritan or a criminal.  It is just technology.  Abstract tools.  A hammer can be used to build something or it can be used to destroy something.

Are you providing a tool or are you explaining how documentation should be written? Upon reading more closely, it looks like you are doing both, but since the site as a whole isn't visually organized to demonstrate that, it's a little confusing. Do you actually want to do both? If so, I would recommend creating a visual organizational structure that makes that more clear. If you mostly care about the tool, I would suggest removing the documentation guidelines from the homepage entirely and putting them somewhere else.<p>- For a documentation site, I think you could really use some more thorough documentation. I understand you are in the early stages of this project, but right now, the question I have (following the line of thinking on your homepage) is ""I understand how to install and make an index page, but how do I <i>really</i> use this tool to document a project?""<p>- In fact, I don't really even know what kind of documentation this tool is designed for. Documenting programming projects? From the example questions you give in the documentation guidelines section, I suppose that's correct. I think you should better flesh out exactly why your project is the one to go with for documenting my next project. You start to get into this in the second paragraph, but really, by the end of the introduction, all I have is that your project will help me understand how to start writing good documentation and it decouples design and content.

As the Google bubble ended starting around 2008 the excitement transferred to some of the leading UGC platforms that had grown into mass market distribution channels in their own right. Facebook mania in 2008 was followed by a similar wave of enthusiasm for the App Store around 2009.<p>All of these mini-funding bubbles focused on specific distribution vectors: Google, Facebook, the App Store. Central to them was a hypothesis in the potential for fast and easy <i>exponential growth</i> for companies, because this was how people justified supra-market valuations.<p>If the ""social bubble"" is deflating now, it's not because Facebook stock is falling so much as because it is increasingly difficult to achieve exponential distribution in these channels and nothing else has come along yet to replace them. And this is what Chris Dixon is saying as I understand him -- if people want to demonstrate that their service is genuinely viral the threshold is much higher since VCs are skeptics.<p>But advising someone who wants to go down the VC route to focus on revenues is still a bad idea, because you can't justify a supra-market valuation without the prospect of exponential growth. If someone is bootstrapping by all means collect money, but be aware that 10k a month is still only 1.5 million total valuation at ten times revenue, which doesn't give a lot of leeway for raising a ton of money by relying on fundamentals.",1345241318

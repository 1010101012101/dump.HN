10055022,comment,10048399,10052014,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"Fossil fuels are seed capital, yes. Modern civilisation has quite the burn rate.<p>I like to consider the technological stack height for various energy systems. For nuclear, as you note, it&#x27;s quite high. One thing this creates is systemic risk of sheer system failure and inability to reboot. One of the consequences of the Fukushima disaster and following shutdown of much of Japan&#x27;s nuclear power sector was that the entire nation faced a shortfall of electrical capacity. Not helped, incidentally, by its dual incompatible power grids, one operating at 60hz, the other at 50hz, limiting inter-tie capabilities.<p>While fossil fuels have a <i>fairly</i> low tech stack requirement, it&#x27;s not zero. For a long time, plant-based sources of equivalents: olive oil and fuelwood, principally, were preferable. They could be obtained locally, processed readily, and renewed themselves.<p>For <i>local</i> use, all you need is a coal face or oil seep. Gas, without industrial means to capture, transport, and contain it is quite problematic, though the Chinese actually did just this, nearly 2,000 years ago, using bamboo pipes and hide bladders[1]. I hate to ask what the fire incidence was....<p>Oil didn&#x27;t take off until an <i>existing</i> coal-based industry provided iron, and later, steel, for drilling, storage, pipes, railroads, and ships. This industry developed incrementally from roughly 1860 to 1900, though even _quite_ early in the process, oil equipment took on much of its modern appearance.<p>The other thing oil wanted for was a practical application: the internal combustion engine, which required: roads, tires, rubber, steel, electricity....<p>Another challenge is that fossil fuels hugely distort prices. We price fossil fuels at <i>extraction</i> effort, but the <i>long-term</i> cost is the <i>replacement</i> cost. Since replacing fossil fuels with <i>more</i> fossil fuels isn&#x27;t viable (we don&#x27;t have 100-500 million years to wait), that generally means existing biomass. Humans appropriate roughly 40% of that <i>now</i>, and it produces at net efficiencies of 1-3% of incident sunlight converted to fuel (algae <i>might</i> boost that to 10%), which has highly specific land, nutrient, (generally fresh) water, and climate requirements.<p>Nuclear seems to offer a possible out, but for <i>any</i> fission-based process is also* a nonrenewable option. Estimates of fuel abundance range from 80 years to a few thousand, <i>at present rates of consumption.</i> Relying on uranium for <i>all</i> present human energy needs would exhaust reserves in 6 years. Breeders offer a 100x improvement in fuel utilisation, but that pushes us from 6 years to 600 (without growth), or 80 to 8,000 at present rates -- a goodly interval, but only slightly longer than our current history. Suggestions of recovery of uranium from seawater might extend lifetimes further, but with another expansion of the the tech stack requirement. And there&#x27;s the near-term immediacy of the problem to boot.<p>I&#x27;m leaning to the side that says that <i>reducing</i> our overall throughput (smaller population, decrreased per-capita affluence, possibly both) is going to have to be part of the solution. That&#x27;s going to be unpopular. Possibly thermodynamically improbable without massive systemic changes, possibly catastrophic.<p>━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━<p>Notes:<p>1. <a href=""http://www.computersmiths.com/chineseinvention/natgas.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computersmiths.com/chineseinvention/natgas.htm</a>",1439480581

They&#x27;re trying to turn the US&#x27;s disenfranchised fringes (who are quite numerous and increasingly disgruntled now a days) inward to attack the state, but right now the propaganda is quite clumsy. See: RT, sputniknews.com, and the others you mentioned.<p>Most of the modern Russian internet propaganda is easy to find, and rarely goes deeper than a bathtub. What is interesting is that they are clearly targeting the left and right leaning populations within the US quite differently. The right is targeted with clumsy racial incitement whereas the left is targeted with clumsy &quot;environmentalist&quot; incitement. There is a ton of overlap, but I bet you can hammer out these separate phyla of propaganda targets quite easily.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to tell how effective these propaganda campaigns are in riling up the target groups because they&#x27;re mainly pushed by shills. Are the crowds of Putin apologists on Reddit actually Westerners who have come to believe (via propaganda) that Putin really is innocuous, or are they the same three people trying to fabricate a consensus?

I&#x27;m being a little unfair here since my sample size is only the people I know who are informed (very few), but even the rabble who can&#x27;t think for themselves aren&#x27;t singing praises to Putin-- probably because the US propaganda saturation has been much higher for many more years, conferring resistance to certain types of outsider propaganda.<p>I really like thinking about this stuff.",1439480363

It is only binding on the trial court in this particular case.<p>Their decisions on <i>patents</i> set precedent, but for copyright they are supposed to follow the precedent of the numbered circuit that the trial court is in, which would be the 9th in this case. Future copyright cases in the 9th will still be appealed to the 9th Circuit, not the Federal Circuit, unless they are also a patent case.<p>I think there needs to be a change to the way appeals work in cases like this. In federal trial courts, there is a thing called supplemental jurisdiction which allows a court to hear claims that they would normally not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear if they are part of a case with other claims that they do have jurisdiction to hear.<p>For example, suppose a business deal goes bad, and ends up spawning a lawsuit involving federal copyright claims and state contract claims. Copyright claims must be heard in federal court. Federal courts normally would not have jurisdiction to hear state contract cases, but because of supplemental jurisdiction the federal court will hear the state contract claims too. If the case was just a state contract case, it could not be brought in federal court.<p>The idea behind supplemental jurisdiction is that in case like my hypothetical business deal gone bad it really is one case that just happened to generate issues that fell under different jurisdictions. If tried separately there would be much overlap in witnesses, documents, and other evidence. It would be an inefficient use of judicial resources and unduly burdensome on the parties and the witnesses.<p>At the appellate level, the court is examining the trial court&#x27;s application of the law, not the trial court&#x27;s determination of the facts. The appeals court works off the transcript and documents from the trial court, and the only people that have to appear physically are the lawyers arguing for the parties.<p>I think it would make a more sense to let appeals from multi-issue cases to go to multiple appeals courts, each appeals court only getting those issues for which it sets precedent. So in a case like Oracle vs. Google, tried in the 9th Circuit, copyright issue appeals should go to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and patent issue appeals should go to the Federal Circuit. In cases like my hypothetical copyright and state contract case, if tried in the 9th Circuit, appeals on copyright issues should go to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and state contract issues should go to a state appellate court.",1439479570

The classic line is that you get circa what your marginal productivity is, but that&#x27;s under some rather stringent assumptions. Also it sidesteps how exactly you calculate marginal productivity. There&#x27;s very little talk about the dynamics of wage settings, ie how do you actually reach a number?<p>From what I can see, as a guy who&#x27;s been in a few businesses, the salary amount starts off with just a simple assumption: we&#x27;ll pay roughly whatever everyone else is paying for a certain job. You then go and find a bunch of likely-sounding candidates and bring them in to interview. (OT: This is a complete mess, because you&#x27;re not as good at this as you think, even taking into account lordnacho&#x27;s law.) You will fall in love with one or two of these people, probably not more. You&#x27;ll then throw out a lowball number on the game theoretical rationale that they&#x27;ll either ask for more or be happy with it. If there are special circumstances like the guy being a recent grad, we can say a bunch of stuff like &quot;you&#x27;re learning a lot from us, you need us more than we need you&quot; (yeah, it&#x27;s a shitty thing to say) and count on other bosses thinking similarly. The candidate can then take it or leave it, or if they have another offer, use that to get a bit more. But it&#x27;s really a silly dance around a fairly static anchor, silly because people can get pissed off over small amounts of money. I&#x27;ve worked with more than one guy who thought he was a great negotiator because he managed to talk some guy down by a few grand, even though a $700M hedge fund makes that amount in about three hours.<p>Now why would wages ever change, if this is roughly what happens? I never came across a situation where there wasn&#x27;t a huge queue of people wanting whatever jobs we put up. In fact, there was no real rationale for setting any particular salary, other than &quot;that&#x27;s the market&quot;. My thinking is that salaries really only go up when companies find zero suitable people for a given job, or when they get a particularly large number of offerees coming back to them saying they took some other job.<p>And what would create a situation where there were very few candidates for a job?<p>1) Collective action. Apart from the London Tube, this seems to be out of fashion. It also seems to be hard to organise something like software devs, given they live in very different cost areas scattered around the world.<p>2) Growth. When things are booming, companies get desperate. They can see the demand, customers are telling them they want product, but they can&#x27;t get the staff they need to build the product. But since they can see the demand, offering a bit more to grab those staff is a bit easier on the executive mind.",1439479323

Or some lenses generate a &quot;vacuum&quot; effect as they focus in and out.<p>Sensors often incorporate an ultrasonic motor which vibrates it and throws dust off.  Or some sensors are mounted on shake tables to reduce blur from operator motion - you can do a similar thing there too.  At the end of the day you just have to be careful though.<p>Like I said, totally possible optically, and yes, very simple to process.  The downsides are that when you split the beams each sensor only gets half the light intensity, which means you need to get more light into the optical system in the first place, and you need 2 sensors, which are by far the single most expensive component in the whole camera.<p>You can actually do something similar with Magic Lantern, a hacked-up open-source firmware for Canon cameras.  They scan alternate rows of the sensor at different sensitivities, and use the low-sensitivity row as the most-significant-bits of dynamic range for the high-sensitivity image.  You lose a bunch of vertical resolution, but hey, you don&#x27;t need 2 sensors.",1439478809

I can&#x27;t imagine how short the blog was.<p>Interesting that the author spends most his words explaining the <i>rent</i> concept, then abruptly ends with speculation that the rise of temp workers, agency workers, part-time workers, basically everyone who is not an FTE, it to blame for labor not capturing the financial benefit of increased productivity.<p>The only solution to this problem is going to be through the tax system. If you hire me to shovel dirt all day long, and one day an inventor sells you a more productive shovel which you give to me, I don&#x27;t really <i>deserve</i> more pay because I&#x27;m shoveling dirt better.<p>But commerce and tax laws are the purview of the democracy, how much money the business owners need to pay back to society for the benefits they receive, and also so society doesn&#x27;t burn their homes and factories down and kill them, is a matter public policy.",1439478341
10054735,comment,10054082,10054082,0,0,roymurdock,,,"Robert Solow, the author of this article, is one of the most well-respected economists of his generation. He derived the &quot;Solow Growth Model&quot; which underpins a good deal of modern macroeconomics. [1]<p>Here, he states that it is customary to think of the value of a firm in terms of (1) returns to labor and (2) returns to capital. He argues that there is a third factor, (3) position in the market, that provides a rent to the owners and shareholders of the company. Just as a title/deed provides the owner with a geographical rent opportunity, regulation creates an opportunity for a company to extract an abstract sort of monopolistic rent within a market. Estimates of this component of rent lie between 10-30% of GDP, and it changes as a function of regulation.<p>He argues that the division of this rent &quot;has been shifting against the labor side for several decades&quot; starting under the Reagan administration, due to (1) the decline of unions and collective bargaining (right to work laws, &quot;hardening of business attitudes&quot;) and (2) the &quot;casualization&quot; of labor, i.e. the increase in part-time/contract-based labor that many companies are able to force onto a workforce that would, in many instances, favor full time employment. These casual workers &quot;have little or no effective claim to the rent component of any firm&#x27;s added value.&quot;<p>In summary, the aggregate workforce is losing bargaining power whereas the aggregate business owners (investors) are gaining bargaining power within the economy, allowing the investors and owners to carve out a larger share of rent profits.<p>While Solow does point out that international competition and &quot;the biased nature of new technology&quot; both play a role in this phenomenon, he strives to emphasize the importance of internal social change in the division of economic rent.<p>Personally, I think that he is dancing around a much more controversial thesis: inequality is a direct result of poor government regulation and oversight (starting with Reagan) which is due to a deterioration of the separation of powers between the public and the private sectors as corporate owners and investors have been able to buy influence in Congress and further support/entrench regulation that favors their own interests. Unions/collections of workers no longer have the power to combat corporate interests at the political/legal level and are being dismantled/shafted which leads to many individual laborers being shafted as well, which is the cause of the nonexistent wage growth.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/Solow-Growth-Model.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/Solow-Growth-Model.pdf</a>",1439478332

We all interact with other people and organisations, and data gets shared as part of those interactions, and often there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with that; some degree of communication is both desirable and inevitable. That doesn&#x27;t mean we should just give up and condone covert collection, arbitrary sharing, and unrestricted use of personal data by whichever disproportionately powerful organisations can get hold of it.<p>For example, Facebook can&#x27;t effectively follow me around the web. I have installed simple browser plug-ins that mean it is not technically possible using the usual techniques like phone-home Like buttons. The sites I visit would have to actively and covertly send data about my visit to Facebook behind the scenes, and most sites aren&#x27;t going to do that.<p>For the record, I <i>do</i> also have a problem with the likes of Google being able to operate a mail service that is actively scanning things I wrote or even blocking messages I&#x27;ve sent to colleagues, which they can do if a recipient of my message uses their service. In effect, they have co-opted someone else to provide data I might have sent that person in confidence, just as mobile apps scan my name and number from a friend&#x27;s address book often without even their knowledge never mind mine. (Of course that kind of action is probably already against the law in my country, but that doesn&#x27;t matter very much unless the relevant authorities have the resources to enforce that law effectively.)<p>I believe almost everything is better when essential infrastructure is neutral and serves a specific purpose. Organisations like Google don&#x27;t so much blur that line as totally erase it, and because I have no way to know that I am participating in their system in the first place, in practice I can&#x27;t even choose not to send that e-mail to that recipient.

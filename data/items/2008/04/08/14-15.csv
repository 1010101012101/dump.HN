Algebra II-level courses to incoming freshmen -- nevermind requiring high school students to take calculus to graduate.<p>> This course, and all of the math up to it, should be required to graduate high school.<p>My guess is that all we would be accomplishing is reducing the high school graduation rate. The only way it would be worthwhile to require calculus to graduate from high school is if we created a two-track high school system and started sending non-college-track kids to vocational school.<p>In any case, I would say that if we were going to revise the high school math curriculum, we should add a year of probability and statistics, not more calculus, especially (god forbid) differential equations. Possibly by shifting ""Algebra I"" into junior high school coursework, or by making Geometry an elective. I strongly suspect that the fundamentals of probability would be a lot more useful to most people than Euclidean geometry.<p>Having high school kids take DiffEqs would do more to make kids hate math than anything I can imagine.",1207664899

157862,comment,156464,156698,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Context is definitely important; the pause function is a nice touch. I don't deny that there are things you can read with RSVP. You probably can see that there are things that aren't suitable for RSVP too. It depends on the content and very importantly, the goal. But I will contest the usefulness of RSVP as a primary approach to reading in daily life; the case for peripheral vision above and below your current focus is strong enough. Your center of gaze is where meaning is most efficiently processed, but peripheral cues do enhance understanding. I would further reason that the spatial arrangement of text is also useful in aiding recall (different topic).<p>Also, the brain, or a little more accurately, your visual memory buffer, does indeed ""cache"" images, which does get deciphered in time, but as the text is flashed to your eyes at a constant rate, it doesn't make a difference. If I flash a stimulus at your eyes for 65ms, you may not consciously detect something, but it will register in your brain and you will process it, after the stimulus is gone. This is the visual buffer in action, but the processing is latent and does not occur at the same speed it takes to send the signal from the optical nerves to the visual cortex. If I flash many short pulses back-to-back, I won't bet on retaining most of the stuff.<p>The one-line RSVP has a fundamental speed limit before your forebrain cannot consciously register (hence willfully reflect upon) the material. While you can pause the reader, it requires intervention by your hands, which could be an unnecessary delay, because your eyes are far quicker and more fine-tuned for this task.<p>Anyhow, I'm sure zapreader has its uses. It does force you to read in a less lazy way, and is also useful (very definitely so) for training, but for those serious about reading very ""fast,"" RSVP can only do so much.",1207664350

Some minorities excel, and you can either allow it or make everyone worse off by banning it. For example, someone who cares about racial equality might demand that blacks be prevented from competing in national sports, or standup comedy, or political oratory, because they tend to excel in these areas. This would deprive us of lots of great entertainers and speakers, and it would create a more equal situation. But obviously the black people don't benefit (they lose the jobs they want and otherwise would have); the white audiences don't benefit (they get worse stuff to watch and hear); and even the whites and other minorities who get the positions reserved for them suffer -- they're out of their depth, and the painful difference between their talent and their ranking makes them even less successful than they otherwise would be.<p>This might have some sort of application to affirmative action schemes, or the efforts to sculpt a course so it somehow doesn't discriminate among the groups that are better or worse at it.

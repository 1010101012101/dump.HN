Plus the most efficient functional datastctures rely on lazy evaluation, adding a layer of complexity to reasoning about their behavior. In fact, in his 10-years PFDS retrospective Okasaki noted exactly that:<p>> In 1993, I ran across an interesting paper by Tyng-Ruey Chuang and Benjamin Goldberg, showing how to implement efficient purely functional queues and double-ended queues. Their result was quite nice, but rather complicated, so I started looking for a simpler approach. Eventually, I came up a much simpler approach based on lazy evaluation, leading to my first paper in this area. (When I say simpler here, I mean simpler to implementthe new structure was actually harder to analyze than Chuang and Goldberg's.)<p>or<p>> , I went into a frenzy, playing with different variations, and a few hours later I came up with an approach again based on lazy evaluation. I was sure that this approach worked, but I had no idea how to prove it. (Again, this was a case where the implementation was simple, but the analysis was a bear.) [...] The whole way home I thought about nothing but how to analyze my data structure. I knew it had something to do with amortization, but the usual techniques of amortization weren't working.",1363118285

Pablo Pomposiello, biotechnologist ----<p>short answer: I was denied tenure at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 2008. It wasn't fun, it wasn't a surprise and it wasn't the end of anything really, other than my employment at UMass. All my graduate students were able to get their degrees. It was a big hit to my ego, and a big reality check: I was not made for a life-long academic career. At that time, and after feeling like dirt for a while, I started consulting for the biotech industry and loved it. In 2009, I moved to Spain and took a job at a start-up, which in turn went belly up. Now I run my own synthetic biology company in Madrid and enjoy a different take on experimental science. I miss teaching, though.<p>The somewhat longer answer: it felt like being the victim of a mafia hit by members of your own ""family"": the same people that yesterday invited you to their kids birthday parties and pinned awards on your lapel are today pulling the trigger. I was treated with exaggerated courtesy, and I could tell some people were truly afraid I could go psycho and do something terrible. It felt unreal, after 15 years of a successful academic career to end like that. It also revealed a lot about the character of my colleagues: some avoiding me as if I had a contagious disease, others offering warm, friendly hands. Some even tried to show me the dark aspects of tenure, which to me sounded like a wealthy person's complaints about wealth.<p>By the way, it is worth saying that the University did everything right, at the Departmental, College and University levels. There was no monkey business in my case. In the previous years, the Dept and the School really helped to lighten my load and facilitate research and grant writing. When the moment came, the Department Chair came to my office almost in tears to explain to me his negative vote, and I knew that without his support, it was a lost cause. I had a long time to prep for the final decision. The Dean took me for lunch when the dust settled, to offer his support.<p>Personally, it helped to push me into a mid-life crisis that had been looming for a while. I was depressed and withdrawn, everyday tasks became titanic work, and I could see the worry in my student's eyes, for me and for their careers. I started therapy, which helped. I tried antidepressants, which didn't. I was advised to take legal action, which I didn't. I guess deep inside me, and despite 16 years of preparation, I knew that it was not my scene. But I was too deep into it to face this reality, and the conflict really took a toll on me.<p>Little by little, and helped by my great Department colleagues and a few close friends, I started shaking the blues off and tried to find comfort and enthusiasm in other aspects of my life. I faced the ultimate question: would I have given tenure to myself, objectively? The answer was clearly no. When I made peace with that reality, I started planning a future. I realized that I was lucky: no kids, relatively young (41) and with a good track record. I got married and I moved to Spain, a country I've always loved.<p>It took me a while to understand that anyone who makes it to a tenure-track position in an American research university has self-started so many projects and amassed such a network that starting anything new is actually quite easy. Good luck to all tenure-trackers out there! And cheers to the tenure survivor, one way or another.",1363118238

A data structure that allows your algorithm to scale gracefully to more cores is actually more performant than a data structure that's faster for a single thread, but is extremely hard to scale in concurrent settings. Clojure sacrifices single-thread performance for multithreaded scaling, and it's the right tradeoff given current hardware trends (for example, consider the design of Clojure's reducers, and how it focuses on multi-core scaling).<p>My main concern with immutable data structures (and most data structures designed to work in concurrent settings, actually), is their heavy reliance on garbage collection, and on old-gen garbage collection in particular.

Are you really going to tell me you have never looked at code written with a package you haven't learned and initially found it to be unintelligible? If not, then I would guess that you are simply well-suited to Haskell. Again, I'm not saying Haskell is bad, but that it does have attributes that make it daunting to many people.

Even compared to a relatively esoteric language like Clojure, Haskell's hump is pretty big.<p>I believe the canonical example of a weird math-based library that makes beginners cry is Control.Arrow. Reading arrow-based code without having fully grasped both the idea of arrows and the API itself (do you think <&&&> could use a few more ampersands?) is an exercise in frustration. Even the humble monoid  simple as it may be  is hard for many people to grasp, because they're such a frustratingly generic idea with horribly unhelpful terminology attached to them.<p>Want more?

The cost of producing Stephen's book to the standards he expected was probably far too high for O'Reilly to have been able to make any profit on it at all without literally doubling the price.

Tense muscles, sweating, breathing changes; the person becomes aware of these and instead of ascribing them to fear they think these are the start of a heart attack.  This causes even more fear and anxiety.  Their heart is now hammering.  They are ""hyper aware"" of their heart beat and breathing and sweating.  They may well feel pain.  This is not ""in their head"". It is real actual pain.  It is the same pain that you would feel if someone punched you in the arm.  They call an ambulance.

Very often we get the question, ""Why should I bother chasing a big publisher if I can self-publish?""<p>Then, people often turn around and call self-publishing companies ""scams"" because everything can be done by hand by the author for free or for cheap.<p>How to reconcile these views, and those of this article?<p>The answer is, companies provide value to a certain type of customer.<p>If you're the type of person who is comfortable doing all of the marketing yourself, submitting to all the right places in all the right formats, hand-designing your book's layout, going so far as to demand a certain thickness of paper, well--traditional publishing is not for you.  You're very correct to claim that you will get a raw deal from traditional publishing, in your case.<p>However, 95% of authors know <i>zero</i> about that kind of stuff.  They have <i>no idea</i> how to market their writing.  They don't know epub from mobi.  They don't know that they can submit to B&N as well as the Amazon store.  They don't know how to format their ebooks.  They don't know how to handle cover art, how to find an artist, how to find a good editor.  Do you think submitting your book to the Kindle marketplace and the B&N marketplace and the Apple marketplace is simple?  Maybe it is--but most authors <i>just can't handle it</i>.  They'd rather be writing.<p>The same can be said about self-publishing outfits.  Many authors call them scams because they charge money for things you could do yourself or cheaper.  Well, that's fine, if you know what to do and how to do it, and you have the time and patience.  But many authors don't.  That's why self-pub outfits aren't necessarily scams, because they provide genuine value to a lot of people.  The important part is being aware that self-publishing mean you're going to be doing much of the legwork of marketing your book yourself, without the cachet of being able to say that someone is publishing you.<p>My point here is--don't expect to be happy with a business arrangement if you're not the business's target customer.  The author of this post by all means should have self-published.  Does that mean O'Reilly, or any other publisher, traditional or self-pub, is a horrible scam and not worth it?  Hardly.  They're very much worth it for the right kind of author.  It's up to you to know what kind of author you are and if the profit tradeoff is worth it.  For the entrepreneurial-minded HN crowd, self-publishing would be the way to go.<p>Edit: I should add that it is also on O'Reilly to realize that he's not their target customer.  It looks like they obviously didn't figure that out despite his seemingly long and demanding contract.",1363116656

I've actively worked for the past two years on core.logic which has quite a few fancy abstractions (custom types, protocols, macros) that all interact quite nicely together. Now, I'm not a Haskell expert, but I do feel that some of the things I've built would be could be challenging in the Haskell context. I might very well be wrong about that.<p>That said, I'm actively learning Haskell as there are some aspects of Haskell I find quite attractive and in particular a few papers that are relevant to my Clojure work that require an understanding of Haskell. My sense is that even should I eventually become proficient at Haskell, my appreciation for Clojure's approach to software engineering would be little diminished and likely vice versa.",1363116584

I was able to program the logic viewing the entire CSV file as a single lazy sequence to transform.<p>After profiling I ended up using Java arrays instead of Clojure vectors as the primary data format for records in the system: given the fact that this app was IO-bound, this resulted in about 20% improvement for that particular use case.<p>However, because Clojure is capable of treating arrays as sequences polymorphically, the change required very few modifications to my code and I was able to maintain a functional style.",1363115286

5364129,comment,5362514,5362757,3,0,nagrom,,,"Funnily enough, in most countries where 'soccer' is popular, it is called by some local direct translation of the word football: football (UK, France), futbol (Latin America, Spain), and Fuball (Germany). And this makes sense, because in 'soccer', the ball is mostly played with the foot. American Football, on the other hand, has the ball mostly played with the hand and only the USA refers to the game as 'soccer', which is an anachronism stemming from the English turn-of-the-century phrase ""Association Football"" - now long defunct in its homeland. And that shows how often Americans speak English that originated in England but is no longer used there, having been supplanted by continentalisms over the course of decades and centuries - see <a href=""http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/adventure-of-english/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/adventure-of-english/</a><p>Of course, you're stuck as to what to call American Football, because handball is now a completely different sport that is popular in central europe, but never really cracked the anglosphere.<p>Completely off-topic, I know, but interesting nonetheless. There's probably some analogy that can be drawn here between common names for things and the various display ports that are used and fail to be standardised upon, but I am too tired to find it :-)",1363114855

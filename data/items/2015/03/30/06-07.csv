Being a heterosexual white male doing business this right comes to my mind first, because the right not to be discriminated mostly benefits me only secondarily. Nevertheless you have to acknowledge when other people&#x27;s rights trump yours. I think it is undebatable that this should be the case here, even if you are concerned with religious beliefs, which I am not.<p>I also think, that religion should get no special treatment by law. In Germany we have § 166 StGB, which is highly in conflict with freedom of expression, because it says, that you can be put in prison for up to 3 years if you hurt somebody&#x27;s religious feelings publicly. Courts mostly ignore the law anyway by valuing freedom of press/art/etc. above it.<p>On the other hand if you join any big German party, you have to confirm, that you are not a member of Scientology (what I totally support), arguing, that it is not a religion, but a sect trying to get traction here. So religious laws do not apply for everything you call your religion anyway, making them senseless in a way, because the small ones do need protection more than the big ones, but are effectively less protected.<p>I can rarely think of a religious rights law, that is not covered by a civil liberty law or should not exists anyway.<p>If I could mix the perfect religious legislation i would choose the French approach, Laïcité [0], and add the German right for children to get religious education in school to prevent extremism by giving up the interpretation to other groups.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9</a>",1427697356

Even if you settle with 1/3rd of this and take in to account that average page size for HTML <i>alone</i> is 200KB, it would be evident that you need 10s of millions of dollars to pay towards hardware. Remember fetching pages costs, storing them, processing them etc costs lots of money and building even semi-scalable index which have in-memory, SSD based layers is super expensive. And we haven&#x27;t even started the major cost factor i.e. human employees.<p>Today&#x27;s search engines are not just indexes of web pages. They give direct answers for &quot;when did Lincoln died&quot;, they show detailed street and satellite maps with StreetViews in search results, they act as business directory, they act as people finder, they have elaborate image search (again super expensive to do), they recognize objects in images, they have freshest news search for thousands of sources, they can do video search, they have scans of 100s of thousands of books, they catalog millions of products and so on. Even getting some of this high quality data such as satellite maps, books, business listings, product catalogues etc would cost ~100 million dollars in licensing deals.<p>Even if you decided to get world&#x27;s most productive programmers you will need at least 300 people in my most minimal estimation and more than 2-4 years before you can build anything that has non-negligible chance of competing. That&#x27;s about $75M of cost per year right there at the ultra-minimal end. Of course, this is assuming you already had bigger breakthrough than that of PageRank and that you can beat state of the art machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Hopefully you can now see, for all intent and purposes, search business is closed to attack via startups. I can imagine Facebook and Apple would sooner or later get in to this business but it would be uphill battle for them primarily because of lack of talent that search engine business requires and more importantly lack of data that only Google has for billions of queries and users doing them. You can build AirBnB with smart college hires but building search engines needs truly the cream of the crop who are perfect rare blend of Computer Scientists and part time mathematicians while also being an exceptionally productive applied programmers. Google has been working for years to sweep away pretty much all talent in this area and it would take most competitors significant effort to build this kind of army.<p>PS: DuckDuckGo is not a &quot;real&quot; search engine. It has a very little of its own index and for most queries they just rearrange results fetched mostly from Bing while inserting links from their own little index. If Bing shuts them out for leaching off of them, they would be toast.",1427695322

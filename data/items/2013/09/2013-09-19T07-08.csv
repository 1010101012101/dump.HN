So what you do when somebody applies a technique on you, which you don&#x27;t know yet, in a situation in which you are caught, which you don&#x27;t yet realize it fully (this perhaps comes later, or never)?

While that strategy makes complete sense in 90% of cases for market innovation, in the mobile phone industry--which, it turns out, was going through <i>revolution</i>--Nokia should have done the opposite. People often forget that Nokia still controls more than 70% of the worldwide phone market, and controlled vastly more of it in the mid-2000&#x27;s. In 2007, they had no idea that 90% of industry profits would come from the 30% of the market that they were not focusing on.<p>You can&#x27;t really fault them for that, because strategically it makes perfect sense. They regarded the competition seriously but had a flawed approach/response.<p>That being said, they had a bunch of half-assed hedges against their fatal strategy, like high-ish end platforms such as Maemo, Symbian&#x27;s advanced versions, etc.., but in fast moving markets with extraordinarily complicated infrastructure/platforms, this approach does not work.

I should point out almost all of my dealings with Israeli's have been positive.<p>However there were consistent appointments of Israeli managers and resources, where there were far more experienced and capable resources outside of Israel. Indians were exploited quite badly and rarely considered for any position above team leader.

The company official language was English, but that did not stop many internal job postings /requiring/ Hebrew (e.g. Central American on-site project, Spanish not required, English and Hebrew a must.)<p>This was not my observation alone, but a general consensus.

Jim Crow and legal racial segregation has been replaced by mass incarceration as a system of social control (More African Americans are under correctional control today... than were enslaved in 1850). Alexander reviews American racial history from the colonies to the Clinton administration, delineating its transformation into the war on drugs. She offers an acute analysis of the effect of this mass incarceration upon former inmates who will be discriminated against, legally, for the rest of their lives, denied employment, housing, education, and public benefits. Most provocatively, she reveals how both the move toward colorblindness and affirmative action may blur our vision of injustice: most Americans know and don't know the truth about mass incarceration—but her carefully researched, deeply engaging, and thoroughly readable book should change that.""",1292578846

Now obviously to do this you need to significantly up the budget for any and all science so that people make a wage which:<p>a) they can live comfortably on 
b) point to so that their clan/community doesn't constantly tell them - ""what a waste of your life, make sure your kids don't do that.""<p>That would have immense trickle down effects and huge repercussions for our development. Civilizational transitions/evolutions have more to do with the introduction of technology (fire, agriculture, the stirrup, medicine, writing, the press) than any other agent (I'm guessing mother nature comes close).<p>So how is this stuff being discussed when ""innovation"" is supposedly meant to save the economy? How do you guys plan to handle this?

I mean, no shit Sherlock! Still, the problem with polygon -> rectangle still exist, you still need to have contraints.<p>> And ""polymorphism"" by itself isn't an end unless it makes your program better.<p>The same holds true for EVERY language feature: it's only useful if it makes your program better --so it's a tautology irrelevant here.<p>> Let me ask you this: is it your opinion that because a square is mathematically a rectangle that you should automatically express this with an inheritance relationship, even if it makes the program worse?<p>No, it's my opinion that if you express mathematical truths right, programs generally get BETTER. The right way is not always inheritance ―it's not even a basic feature of OO programming according to Alan Kay―, but in this case the example fits, and the ""problem"" spot you mention is contrived and easily solved.<p>And if you don't like theory, here's practice and history for you: a) almost EVERY successful game and drawing program written in a OO language, or C with some hacks (that makes 99% of 'em), uses such a shape hierarchy.<p>> It's absolutely ""world modeling."" You're trying to take some ontological fact about some object (in this case, a mathematical object) and express that in a software design.<p>Math (and logic) != world.<p>And a ""mathematic object"" is not an object, it's the expression of some axioms and constraints. The more faithfully you capture those in your code, the better off you are.",1292576517

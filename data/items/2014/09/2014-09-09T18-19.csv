Yes, in my opinion taking my phone out of my pocket and putting it back in again is one of those irritations you don&#x27;t notice until it goes away and then you wondered how you lived for so long doing that dumb behavior. Setting your phone on the dinner table, constantly looking at it when you are trying to walk around town ... the watch could be subtly revolutionary for those thousands of glances a day.<p>2) always <i>touching</i> the user. I am extremely excited, or at least intrigued, by what is possible with persistent two-way haptic communication. Without having used the dev kit, and without feeling the actuators, I don&#x27;t know how nuanced the communication can be. But there could be a whole new world here.<p>Just a thought from the &quot;maybe they aren&#x27;t idiots at Apple&quot; perspective.",1410288961

Do the best you can in the place you are now, and it will lead to possibilities that you didn&#x27;t know existed or were possible.

Not sure how many people need a watch to tell them that their phone is ringing.<p>Good job, Apple.  While I&#x27;m sure there will be some adherents who will buy whatever you will produce, the Android watch makers will already be on their next iteration AND will have seen your specs to boot.

8292012,comment,8291662,8291900,2,0,k-mcgrady,,,">> &quot;watches are primarily fashion items, and every single person has an often quite different preference from the next person. I have a very specific style of watch I like to wear, and there&#x27;s zero chance Apple or Samsung is just going to happen to make that style.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s important to remember than most people under around 30 years old do not wear a wrist watch. So they probably don&#x27;t have a specific strap or face style they like. They want something cool something that makes it easier to take selfies or send stuff to Facebook.<p>I think that we will look back on this like the first iPhone. Very cool but missing lots of obvious features. If they can sell enough of them they can afford to push the research to make them smaller, faster, and better and in a few years we&#x27;ll have the equivalent of the iPhone 4 which is when I think the iPhone finally nailed it. But to get there you have to start somewhere. I think this is the right place to start. It&#x27;s good enough, it&#x27;s better than what&#x27;s out there, and lots of people will buy it.",1410288917

It won&#x27;t happen overnight, and you have to be understanding with yourself when you&#x27;re tired, but a 40 hour a week job doesn&#x27;t limit what you can do.<p>I find this to be very true.  When I started out in the professional world, I rarely wanted to work at all on my own professional development after work.  After a year or so, I became much more comfortable with my responsibilities at work and was a much more competent employee.<p>I found that frustration at work fueled my motivation to rise above the &#x27;average&#x27; developer and truly master the technology stack that I currently work in.  I started identifying activities that were eating up my time and my productivity (too much web browsing, too many games, etc).  I started working on SMALL projects with realistic scope.  Completing these small projects motivated me even more and the momentum helped me continue the trend.<p>Now coding outside of work is fun again, and even though I&#x27;m not changing the world, I know it made a noticeable impact to my skills as a developer.<p>OP, I think a lot of us have been in a similar boat.  Making the transition into the real world can be an anxious or even scary time.  Don&#x27;t worry, keep your head up and don&#x27;t try to focus on all of the unknowns at a once.<p>Look at your current employment as an opportunity for personal growth.  If you are confident about your technical abilities, hone your interpersonal relations instead.  Use the time wisely and try to reflect on your progress as objectively as possible.

I was referencing 2004, only six months or so after iRO officially came out of beta. To say it improved since then is an understatement. Based on what I last knew about the scripting capabilities of the Gravity server implementation (circa 2008), I can safely say that eAthena eventually came to provide an easier model for rudimentary content creation and management than the official software.<p>Never mind security. Trying to wrap your head around the code behind why opening a dialog via item X and performing client action Y on the keyboard would bypass <i>what should have been a server-side security check for a very important game mechanic</i> was a lesson in all sorts of SE principles. Unnecessary coupling and spooky action at a distance, for starters. Repeat this a hundred times and mix in a handful of SQL injection points, plus some fundamental disagreements in how and when the game&#x27;s content assumed characters would appear on a new map, versus how and when the official servers actually worked.<p>I am curious if and how eAthena eventually deviated from some of the idiosyncratic behavior of the official game servers.<p>From what I&#x27;ve heard in the years since I stopped playing, though, is that Gravity took the profits from their microtransaction e-store and managed to actually plow that money into improvements for the GM team&#x27;s ability to meaningfully manage their servers and community.

It shows in the distinct lack of documentation on why a given benchmark matters.<p>As for Phoronix&#x27;s ZFS benchmarks, the test hardware used drives that misreported themselves as having 512-byte sectors, which handicapped ZFS performance. Phoronix rejected all suggestions that it correct for this as end-users had been doing. Phoronix refused to meet half way by posting two results (one with proper configuration and one without), and also refused the suggestion that it to mention the existence of that problem in its test hardware. I eventually wrote code to identify drives known to misreport their sector sizes so that ZFS will automatically use the correct settings on them. That lead to the Phoronix August 2013 benchmarks showing a remarkable improvement in ZFS performance in FIO. It was so great that it sparked a discussion among the btrfs developers:<p><a href=""http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/27546"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/2754...</a><p>Later that month, I publicly criticized Phoronix for posting misleading benchmarks:<p><a href=""http://phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?83731-ZFSOnLinux-0-6-2-released"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?83731-ZFSOnLinux-0...</a><p>Phoronix has not posted ZFS benchmarks since that time.",1410288627

Your life is so far from set in stone at age 21 that you won&#x27;t believe how different 21 is from even age 25, just a few years down the road. The grass will always seem a bit greener elsewhere, but that&#x27;s human nature, especially when you&#x27;ve just graduated college. When I graduated, I had a top notch degree (like it matters), but I didn&#x27;t even have a good job that paid the bills easily. It was what I thought I really wanted to work in, what I thought I should be doing, so I took a huge pay cut to be a low-level researcher. I was so jealous of my friends who graduated and took a &quot;boring job&quot; that paid triple what mine did, who got benefits and bonuses, and did exactly what @anigbrowl said - they banked money for a few years and it set them up for so much success. They fostered their own interests on the side, paid off any debt or loans they had, got cars or houses, and saved up their money. Without fail, all of those friends found jobs they enjoyed far more (some of them through connections at that boring job they didn&#x27;t like in the first place), jobs that let them have a greater impact on the world, and jobs that were more in line with their interests as they evolved through their 20s. And again without fail, none of them accurately predicted the direction their lives and passions would go from the time they were 21 until now.<p>I did the same thing, but without the added benefit of making any money like you&#x27;re doing now. I had such a strong notion of what I wanted to do, and as I spent more time messing around with ideas in my spare time and learning more about what I wanted for myself, those notions changed so radically that I went from stem cell research to IDEs in a matter of years. The thing that helped me the most were the people around me. I was able to talk out all my thoughts and worries and anxieties. I was able to share in other people&#x27;s interests and passions to see if maybe those were mine too. It made me feel like I wasn&#x27;t alone, like things weren&#x27;t hopeless, and like I had the potential to be extraordinary if I wanted to be. Ultimately the things that have truly begun to define my life came from utterly unexpected places, and almost entirely from the cast of friends and family around me.<p>Hang in there, the path gets clearer.",1410288082

Otherwise, I do not see anything actionable here. Your criticism so far contains zero verifiable claims.<p>As for XFS, it is a single block device filesystem that relies on external shims to scale to multiple disks. ZFS can outscale it when various shims are put into place to allow multiple disks to be used. One user on freenode had difficulty getting good sequential performance from XFS + LVM + MD RAID 5 on 4 disks. He reported that he could not get better than 44MB/sec writes while ZFS managed 210MB/sec. I had a similar problem in 2011 with ext4 + LVM + MD RAID 6 on 6 disks. In that case, I could only manage 20MB/sec. It is why I am a contributor to the ZFSOnLinux project today. To make these anecdotes constructive, it would be nice if we had documentation on how to configure XFS + LVM + MD RAID 5/6 in a way that sequential performance does not suffer. In my case, my performance issue involved KVM/Xen guests. I never confirmed whether that user ran his tests on bare metal, but I suspect that he did.<p>XFS&#x27; inability to scale past a single block device is not its only issue. Until a disk format change occurs that will add checksums, it has none to protect itself against corruption. When it gains them, it will not be able to do anything about that corruption when it detects it (aside from keeping the kernel from panicing) and it does nothing to protect your data.<p>That said, ZFS has always focused on obtaining strong performance. This is why it has innovations like ZIL, ARC and L2ARC. The only instances where ZFS purposefully sacrifices performance is when getting a few extra percentage points means jeopardizing data integrity. There would have been no sense in developing ZFS as a replacement for existing filesystems if it did not keep data safe.",1410287060

Apparently Japan has a small stockpile of weapon-grade plutonium, and a huge stockpile of less refined plutonium. So they could build a small number of bombs quickly (the 6 month estimate), but building more would require either designing the weapon around less refined plutonium (which increases the risk that it would not work) or building a refinement plant (several years). They would also need some way to deliver the weapons---the most difficult option is ballistic missiles, which gives the 10-year estimate, while cruise missiles on submarines would be faster.<p><a href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/85865"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/85865</a>  (see footnote 35 on page 11)<p><a href=""http://thediplomat.com/2012/10/japan-joining-the-nuclear-weapons-club-it-could/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thediplomat.com/2012/10/japan-joining-the-nuclear-wea...</a><p><a href=""http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v026/26.1kamiya.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v026/26.1k...</a>",1410287012

It seems like moving to PEGs or ANTLR would be less drastic -- i.e. to generated top-down.<p>That may be a historical thing though, because top-down parser generators seem to have come a lot later (was there anything before ANTLR&#x27;s predecessors?)<p>I find top down parsers a lot more intuitive and this article seems to say it&#x27;s not just me (despite the fact that his project is bottom-up?).  I think there is some confusion about top down parsers and arithmetic expressions, e.g. left recursion.  But it seems much easier to mix top down parsers with other techniques like operator precedence parsing.  You can always insert arbitrary code for one of the rule/production functions.<p>I don&#x27;t believe you can mix LALR with anything else.<p>PEGs are really just a formalization of recursive descent, which I think makes them a very practical choice.  I implemented a PEG parsing interpreter awhile ago.  What I discovered though is that it&#x27;s a lot more natural to have a separate traditional lex phase, and use the PEG abstraction (ordered choice with negations) for parsing only.<p>It seems extremely natural because:<p><pre><code>  - it uses the same top down algorithm as hand-written parsers\n  - easy to reason about in terms of correctness\n  - easy to reason about in terms of performance\n  - easy to mix with other paradigms\n  - I think it&#x27;s easier to reason about how to insert good error messages too, though I have to investigate this more.\n</code></pre>\nSo I think there is a missing design choice.  PEGs are kind of coupling  lexing and parsing, while you could use a PEG-like algorithm for a top down generated parser only.  I believe that is a very practical choice for a lot of systems that use hand coded recursive descent.<p>PEGs are relatively new (2004) so it&#x27;s not that surprising that the entire design space hasn&#x27;t been explored yet.",1410286681

While most backbones have been all-IP for a long time, the copper/cellular last mile is still mostly circuit-switched, even more so internationally.<p>[1] I&#x27;d be very surprised if VoLTE traffic, including media, was sent over the public Internet at the same QoS as the rest of your data. Voice-over-LTE is a nice technical achievement -- IIRC reliability was very difficult to ensure, especially during 3G/2G handoff -- but to consumers, VoLTE means nothing.",1410286569

I imagine that the CoreOS developers managed to avoid issues like ENOSPC by virtue of not writing to their rootfs very much. I did not have that luxury since I compiled a Gentoo GNU userland on top of it during the course of development. I encountered numerous ENOSPC errors on btrfs when developing the ZFS port to CoreOS and even hit ENOSPC errors when trying to correct the btrfs ENOSPC errors with `btrfs balance /`. I would not consider btrfs ready for production use, but your mileage will vary.",1410285908

8291635,comment,8290681,8291563,4,0,chubot,,,"You&#x27;re drawing the wrong conclusion from that evidence.  Parser generators aren&#x27;t an &quot;academic exercise&quot;; they are a practical and useful tool for designing languages.  You want a compact notation to describe the syntax of a new language, from which code can be generated.<p>Once the design has settled, however, then there are engineering advantages to using a hand-written parser.  That is why you see GCC moving to a hand-written parser.  Lua followed the same evolution -- using Yacc at first, and now a hand-written parser.  This is discussed in one of the Lua history papers.<p>To see evidence of this, look at how many crappy proprietary DSLs exist at various companies (I&#x27;ve worked at EA and Google and can name examples from each).  Many of them use ad hoc parsers and would have been better off starting with a parser generator.",1410285782

ZFS is so good at detecting corruption (CKSUM errors) that when it happens it is hard to tell what caused it: faulty RAM corrupting data before being written to disk or after being read from disk, or data corrupted on disk? ECC simply helps reduce a good chunk of corruption errors caused by faulty RAM. That said, in my experience there are a few tell-tale signs that RAM is the issue: when you see CKSUM errors poping up infrequently, and not being attributed to consistently the same drive(s).",1410285744

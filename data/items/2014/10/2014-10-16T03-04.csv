[1 citing 2] The right wing think-tank AEI reported a smaller disparity of about 9% a few years earlier. [3] For what it&#x27;s worth, these rates are fairly variable over the years.<p>So &quot;huge numbers&quot; seems like quite a stretch.<p>Moreover, I used the broader term &quot;policies&quot; rather than &quot;rates&quot; for a reason.

What about taking care of our sick?  Funding projects that are too risky for our current quarter to quarter ROI business culture?  Keeping people from starving?  Taking care of the disabled?  Education?  I could go on and on.  Even our &#x27;Imperial military&#x27; does a lot of humanitarian good across the world and responds to disasters like no other organization on Earth.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it is all sunshine and lollipops.  Obviously there are things that I&#x27;d rather our government not do, but, when it comes to living in a Democratic Republic, sometimes you have to accept the will of the majority even if you don&#x27;t agree with it.  And sometimes there is enough room for bad actors to do things that range from unethical to appalling.  It is a process of constant reform.  It always will be.<p>But calling for a dismantling, to toss away the collected, hard earned, wisdom of the last 250 years codified into laws and hundreds of years of Common Law before that because parts are lousy?  Honestly, that just seems like a lazy approach.  Not to mention an approach that lacks imagination when it comes to really mentally modelling what such a system would look like without resorting to near utopian wishful thinking.<p>I mean, really, laws, like sysadmins, are doing their job well when you hardly notice they are there.  The stuff you are noticing is horrible, but it is just the surface oil slick on a much calmer and more important sea.",1413431682

He immediately called the police and the parents were arrested.<p>People on HN pretend like every drug user is a high functioning recreational user.

Metrics like revenue and subscriber numbers don&#x27;t mean much if they can&#x27;t reliably make a profit off of them. Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I do think that Netflix (or something like it) represents the future of content delivery and that there is incredible room for growth. Unfortunately, the potential upside is already priced into the shares. They may have a first mover advantage, but they do have competition (Hulu, Amazon, et cetera).

It gets subtyping & co-/contra-variance right -- for generic types only, not arrays, and requires explicit annotations (&quot;extends&quot;, &quot;super&quot;). It can express higher-order functions. Its primary formal weakness compared with, say, Haskell98 or SML, is the lack of higher-kinded types (ignoring for the moment the issue of Haskell-style typeclasses or ML-style modules & functors), which is a pretty big weakness but not a game-killer (see: Rust, Elm).<p>But pragmatically, it&#x27;s a pain in the ass to work with. (Possibly this has improved since I worked with it. I hope it has!) It has a weird &quot;everything must be an object&quot; view of the world; it requires a file for every type I wish to define (barring nested classes, and anonymous classes - the latter of which is a notable but late improvement). Expressing HOFs is possible, but very unpleasant (AIUI it&#x27;s gotten better lately). And just to top it all off, it doesn&#x27;t have type inference, which just makes everything a chore.<p>The way I see it, Java is playing catch-up with the innovations introduced by more forward-thinking languages. It seems doomed to being forever a middle-of-the-road language.

Yes, I know about structs, but often that&#x27;s not applicable.  And if the type name is some long thing, then you have to really look carefully to notice they are all the same type.

These companies all benefited from the stable business climate that the US government largely provides(stable judicial system, Delaware Companies, a stable financial system, State University systems that provide research grants that made Google possible in first place etc.) So why should these Corporations that benefitted from that not pay their fare share of taxes? I hate pay taxes too but I pay them and I understand that they pay for services I benefit from. You sound both naive and uninformed. Its a farce that American companies that make billions pay almost no tax on those profits while us little people shoulder the burden. Did you actually read the article?",1413428577

Most of the millenia of human history have been repeatitive and slow moving. Most people in history lived in exactly the same material conditions, and general culture, as their parents and grandparents.<p>This is something quantifiable, in productivity, in number of inventions, in being able to do extremely important things for the first time in human history (electricity and artificial light, urbanization, nuclear power, flying, space exploration, tele-communications, computing, medicine and biology, etc). All those things are totally unlike the 16th or the 9th century, and they have been picking up pace since the industrial revolution.<p>And the 70&#x27;s to today (50 years) is not that much in the course of human history. Not even the whole 20th century is. So it&#x27;s not like those were district periods that &quot;got it wrong&quot;, all those decades belong to the same historical period, and were indeed &quot;special times&quot;.",1412535554

Right now, miners get 25BTC for completing a successful block. Satoshi expected that at the time this became halved, fees to the miners would take over.

The inevitable outcome assuming continued success of the bitcoin protocol is that as more people want it and supply cannot change it becomes a lot like gold, in that it is traded as a resource backing currency. You could still use it for transactions, but a money that is long run appreciating in value is not very conductive of exchange. Something like dogecoin, peercoin, or any cryptocurrency implemented that algorithmically adjusts generation rates to maintain consistent monetary velocity would be much better suited as a day to day exchange commodity.<p>Also, one of the most prominent uses of bitcoin is in international exchange, in which case yeah, it acts as an intermediary between local fiats, but there is substantial pressure to just use the bitcoin outright rather than constantly converting it back.",1412535367

8413040,comment,8412425,8412425,1,0,gracenotes,,,"Nice article. I got too far into it before realizing I was essentially tricked into reading an academic paper :) There seems to be a tradeoff between clear presentation of an idea and the formalization required to usefully build off of it/publish it. Abstractions which do both (e.g. Turing machines) get more reuse, I think.<p>The sublogarithmic result is constructive, though, and my understanding of it is like this: We can split up a decision problem (take in a string, give a yes/no answer) over many workers by splitting up the input string into sqrt(n) chunks of size sqrt(n) each and using a shared working space. The first worker handles the first chunk with a blank working space, the second worker handles the second chunk with finished working space from the first one, etc. until the last worker handles the last chunk, with the second-to-last&#x27;s working space, and gives a yes/no answer. This can be parallelized into a single MapReduce round by instead having every worker process their chunk using every possible configuration of the shared working tape. This sounds like a lot of work, but if shared working area is sublogarithmic in size, calculating such a table fits within polynomial time and sqrt(n) space. This means that one final &quot;reduce&quot; step can take the working space from the first input chunk, pass it through the second input chunk in constant time, and so on until it can make a decision.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any practical sublogarithmic space problems off the top of my head but evidently there are some good ones in graph theory. If you tried to implement the above in practice, you could imagine that the final reduce step could be intelligent about combining the processing stages so workers don&#x27;t need to calculate <i>every</i> single configuration.<p>What is unclear to me is whether all Turing machine deciding languages in sublogarithmic space can be chunked in this way. The usual definition of an input read head is that you can go left or right whenever you want, but having access to the entire input means that the workers can&#x27;t be cleanly chunked. You could say the input is one-way like a DFA/PDA, but is there a result that these are equivalent with sublogarithmic scratch space?",1412534801

8413027,comment,8412679,8412679,1,0,angrycoder8,,,"Ok here is my 2 cents.  The reason I feel Bitcoin has lost so much over the last couple of months is because in some ways its a victim of its own success.  The more merchants that come online and support BitCoin payments the faster its going to drop in value.  The reason is simple, supply & demand and bitcoin payment/exchange gateways.  When merchants say they are accepting Bitcoin as payment they aren&#x27;t really, they are simply using Bitcoin as a conduit to process the payment from you the customer with Bitcoin.  When a merchant uses a Bitcoin payment gateway,  upon receiving Bitcoin payment, the gateway immediately turns it into a fiat currency by hitting the buy side of an exchange.  They are putting more bitcoins back into circulation, in other words increasing the SUPPLY of Bitcoin.  Its Economics 101 increase the Supply of any commodity, and the price goes down.\nOn the other side of the equation, the investors who are buying and holding Bitcoin, with the expectation of it going higher, are seeing it plunge, so what they are doing is buying more goods and services instead of holding, a way to get &#x27;out&#x27; of their position if you will, and that further drives the price down, its a vicious cycle.\nWhen will the price of Bitcoin start going back up?  Who knows, for me I feel the indicator will be similar to observe the relative strengths of the fiat currencies, in times of peace or economic uncertainty ( not now ) they tend to show weakness, and traditionally speculators will find safe haven in gold, I think some may try to weather the storm in Bitcoin as well.  Unfortunately that is not the case at the moment, both US and Canadian economies seem to be doing well, partially because of the &#x27;war&#x27; the US is currently waging.  So for me I think I&#x27;m going to sit on the sidelines and wait.",1412534580

This concept of some unseen physical manifestation of the model arises because of the terms a theoretician chose to identify elements of his mathematical model. They&#x27;re essentially undefined terms, given meaning by their context in the larger physical system.<p>A lot of people get lost in the undefined terms, thinking that because we use a familiar word for the term, that the item in the model which the term identifies somehow actually exists. Actually there&#x27;s no proof that the quantum froth exists as physical object, any more than that light is somehow both a wave and a particle. Rather, wave/particle &quot;duality&quot; is a consequence of different mathematical models which happen to generate results which are consistent with observation.<p>The &quot;duality&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually exist, and the way light behaves is so incredibly nuanced that people dedicate their lives to modeling and testing it. Waveness and Particleness are models which produce mathematics consistent with the natural world.<p>In the cases where more than one mathematical model fits the same set of observations, scientific controversies arise. A Physical theory is accepted when the mathematical model produces results which are consistent with observation, and sufficient experimental work has been done to rule out other mathematical models with overlapping explanatory power.<p>My thermodynamics professor opened all of his classes by saying &quot;Everything I am about to tell you is a carefully constructed series of lies.&quot;",1412533513

If you do this, you are an asshole, too.<p>I experienced this sort of condescension all through medical school, and my experience is not unique. There is nothing more embarrassing, deflating, and discouraging than being made to feel like an idiot in front of your peers because you could not recall a piece of information, or because a question of yours was deemed too basic and simple for an expert to waste their time answering. That is how you stunt curiosity and instill destructive self-doubt. My most beloved teachers are those who exercised patience and did not treat any question as beneath them. I didn&#x27;t take advantage of it. In fact, I was more motivated to learn and to return to discuss new ideas and concepts.<p>This reflects on a wider social view in which coming across as ignorant or not knowing the answer to a question is perceived as a sign of weakness. If you don&#x27;t know something, you don&#x27;t admit it and instead bullshit your way to perceived expertise.<p>My point is, people who do this are a net negative to your growth and society at large. It&#x27;s taken me a while to grow comfortable with not knowing <i>a lot</i>, and to accept that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. When I encounter people like this, I view them as nothing more than assholes who are not worth interacting with, and move on to finding the answer I need. What saddens me is that there are many who are stopped dead on their path to learning.<p>/rant",1412532345

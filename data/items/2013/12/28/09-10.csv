I made the post because all the big players, even together, don&#x27;t have most of the great (foreign) films I&#x27;ve seen. This makes it so that my only option is to hope and wait until they do (though the problem is I&#x27;ve already seen them, so the new problem is that I&#x27;d want &#x27;related films&#x27; for the ones I&#x27;ve already seen).

These texts contain profound meditations on every point on the spectrum of human concern: existence, reality, God, love, duty, marriage, war, sex, death, violence, laughter, beauty, perception, nature, anatomy, urbanity, ritual, desire, food, purpose, meaning, and language, among hundreds of others. Moreover, Sanskrit texts are the repository of non-modern modes of thought, and they present distinct conceptions of the world that are often at odds with the understanding we have today. By learning how people used to think, we better understand both ourselves and the world we have inherited.<p>&quot;By learning this language, you open the door to more than three thousand years of intellectual history, both in India and beyond.&quot;",1388223920

One thing I&#x27;ve been thinking about recently is that it could be interesting if there was some GUI system that would follow the Unix principle of having many small, task specific applications that could be easily composed together. It happens to me a lot that there are 3 applications each of which does something better than the other 2 but in the end of the day none of them is ideal. If I could pick the best of the 3 and put it together myself, that would be great.<p>Later, I realized that Mac OS&#x27; Automator/Applescript might have been an attempt to do something like this but it feels somewhat half-assed.

But constructible numbers still don&#x27;t have decidable equality, since the halting problem reduces to constructible equality: is the number whose 2^-ith place is 1 if and only if the Turing machine M halts on the ith step equal to 0? You can approximate it arbitrarily well by running M for more and more steps, but proving that it&#x27;s 0 would require proving that M never halts.

If I&#x27;m not mistaken that example also disproves your stated conjecture... [that between any two points in the set, there is a third one] ;)<p>Fair enough.  Consider, then, the intersection of the Cantor set with the irrational numbers (you can think of this as the &quot;open Cantor set&quot;).  It is, obviously, a subset of the Cantor set, and really does have the property described.<p>Since I&#x27;m feeling embarrassed about that last time, a proof follows:<p>-----<p>The Cantor set consists of all real numbers in the interval [0,1] which have a &quot;decimal&quot; expansion in trinary which does not contain the digit 1.  That is to say, they can be expressed in terms of powers of (1/3) such that the coefficient of each power of 1/3 is either 0 or 2.  (1/3 would usually be represented in trinary as 0.1, but is in the Cantor set because of its representation as 0.02222222...)<p>Let <i>a,b</i> be two irrational numbers in the Cantor set, <i>a</i> less than <i>b</i>.  There is some decimal place at which they diverge, and since <i>a</i> is smaller, it has a 0 at that point, while <i>b</i> has a 2.  Since <i>a</i> is irrational, it also has a 0 at some <i>later</i> point in its expansion (if every digit after that were 2, then <i>a</i>&#x27;s expansion would be repeating and <i>a</i> would be rational).  The number constructed by substituting a 2 for a 0 at that index is greater than <i>a</i>, less than <i>b</i>, and in the Cantor set.<p>Graphical representation of the proof:<p><pre><code>    a = 0.......0......\n    b = 0.......2......\n</code></pre>\nthen<p><pre><code>    a = 0.......0....0.....\n    c = 0.......0....2.....\n    b = 0.......2..........</code></pre>",1388221742

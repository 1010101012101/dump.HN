He is one of the maintainers of the popular ReactiveUI functional reactive programming MVVM framework.<p>When programming Geoff tends to write in a asynchronous, functional reactive manner using the Reactive Extensions and Xamarin but has been known to ship JavaScript (node.js) and Python. With Xamarin, applications are written entirely in C# or F#, sharing the same core library code on iOS, Android & Windows Phone. Anything you can do in Objective-C, Swift or Java, you can do in .NET with Xamarin to create beautiful native apps.<p>He regularly does presentations on Xamarin technologies and has over 20 years industry experience as a T-shaped individual with deep technology, business and entrepreneurship experience. You will never see death by powerpoint on his watch - minimal, to the point, tied together with effective storytelling. He is comfortable switching between technical and non-technical styles of communication as needed to a variety of audiences.<p>As part of constant and never ending learning, Geoff is actively engaged in contributing to the Xamarin and Microsoft .NET open-source community. Open-source for him is a way of life, when hes not authoring code you will find him building communities, passing down knowledge and mentoring first timers.<p>He lives in Sydney, Australia.<p>If youve got a position in mind or a interesting project you want to get off the ground send an email to ghuntley@ghuntley.com with your requirements for a confidential discussion.",1241157377,1452104476

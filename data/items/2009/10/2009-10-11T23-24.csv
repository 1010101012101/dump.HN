 because in the event of failure, your downtime probably runs much less than an hour.  Downtime due to a hardware problem on a rented or coloed server is likely to be much more than that.  Maybe that tradeoff is acceptable to keep the costs down, but it is a tradeoff.

This is likely true at the high-end. But the vast majority of college students are not at the high-end. At the mean, universities have to mop-up after a dysfunctional K-12 establishment based on self-esteem and social-promotion. Remedial reading, writing, and mathematics are common at second- and third-tier universities. The scope of ""special needs"" has been broadened to include customers who are incapable of producing college-level coursework.<p>To ensure that students who elect to pursue a rigorous education are not penalized relative to those who do not so choose, grades at those institutions have been inflated to meaningless extent.<p>The educational industrial complex is geared toward growth. Effectively serving that market requires lower baseline standards and less meaningful quality metrics within the serviced population. Certainly the market is consuming more educational product than in the early 60s, but whether this produces a better educated populace is less obvious--unless ""better educated"" is defined to mean ""consumed more educational product.""<p>~<p>""in the early 60s there was a massive gender gap in college attendance""
As an aside, today's gender gap is the opposite: colleges attract fewer males than females. If you consider graduation and 4-year graduation rates, the gap is greater and growing faster. I don't know that this marketing failure says anything about the quality of education though.",1255304667

875536,comment,874902,875448,0,0,btilly,,,"Really!  Getting lots of other people to take on debt results in many other people making immediate profits to the short term benefit of all.<p>Consider.  We get Sally to take out a large mortgage on her home.  The person issuing the mortgage takes the mortgage, sells it to an investment bank, and makes an immediate profit.  At the investment bank they take those loans (small investments with considerable risk), bundle them into a deal, and slice and dice off several (rated) safe tranches that they sell for a profit.  The purchasers of said debt get to take money that wasn't making interest and put it into something that makes money, resulting in an immediate profit on the books.<p>All of those companies along the way record profits, and pay generous bonuses to the people who did those things.  Those bonuses are a profit to the individual that is kept whether or not the organization runs into future problems.  Which creates perverse incentives.  There were many individuals who realized that they were doing something unsustainable.  But if you don't do it, you'd lose your cushy job, while if you do it you make nice bonuses.  From their point of view the possible eventual failure of Lehman etc were externalities and they were motivated by their current bonuses.<p>Furthermore back in the neighborhood, Sally didn't sit on her money.  Instead she spent it.  The various businesses she spent money at get to record profits on those sales, which in turn goes to hiring people, paying healthcare premiums, etc.<p>None of that would happen if Sally didn't take out that mortgage.<p>In short what has happened is that the taking on the debt results in causing money to circulate.  As money circulates, multiple people record profits.  This is well understand, and is why standard macro-economic theory says that money is effectively created when debt is taken on.  And, on the whole, this is a good thing.<p>The problem, of course, is that just as money gets created by the taking on of debts, money gets destroyed when debts are abandoned.  And when people take on debts they can't afford, they do get abandoned.  Which is the current problem we are dealing with right now.",1255304199

875505,comment,874902,875168,0,0,mkn,,,"<i>As for government in education, it corrupts education completely. <snip> [Government-run education] sinks to a very low level, teachers are handcuffed by bureaucrats and public opinion in their teaching methods, honest perspectives on history, ethics, and civics become impossible to learn, bad teachers don't get fired, good teachers with non-traditional backgrounds don't get hired... like, government doing a lot of stuff is a relatively new idea, and it's a nice idea, but it usually doesn't work so well in practice.</i><p>What an incredibly simplistic analysis! 'Analysis' is too strong of a word; this is mere polemic. It is clearly <i>not</i> the case that government completely corrupts education. It is further untrue that any of the consequences described can be attributed entirely to the fact that government runs public education.<p>The parent merely asserts that government 'corrupts' education and then lists a bunch of alleged educational maladies. Many of these maladies are clearly due to the fact that schools are institutions and that they serve pluralistic communities. The point about bureaucracy is especially vacuous. Can we even imagine a school or school district, public or private, without imagining an attendant bureaucracy? Another poster mentioned Marx; is it lost on the parent that Marx talks about, iirc, alienation due to private bureaucracies as well as government ones?<p>The real causes of problems in education will not turn out to be so simple as 'government.' The real problems will turn out to hinge partly on the peculiar aspects of government bureaucracies vs. private bureaucracies for sure, but will also stem from economic issues like poverty and hunger, social and socio-economic issues like the amount of time parents spend away from home working, and cultural issues like the value placed on education and civic responsibility by contemporary culture, and many other possibly irremediable causes.<p>Finally, the form of the original 'argument' offered is this: There is an overly simple problem, it has an overly simple cause, and the solution is simply to remove that cause. The truth is that both the causes and effects of real-world situations are both more complex and more intractable than that. That any adult should fall for such a blatant oversimplification is perhaps a clearer indicator of the trouble with current corporatist culture than the addled mind of Michael Moore could ever conceive.",1255303057
875504,comment,875418,875418,0,0,marcamillion,,,"Hey Zack,
     Firstly let me say that I love the idea. I can see it being very valuable. I am working on an idea myself, and I can definitely see us using this service once we are ready - who knows when that will be. I am sure you know how that process goes.<p>Secondly, I must also commend you for charging from the get-go. The price point seems good, what I was looking for though was a 'pricing page' that tells me what I am getting for my $20/mo and other plan options. I would also like to see other options, say only 3 or 5 keywords with a more limited account for $10/mo. Couple that with a 15-day free trial (7-days I think is too short) and you reduce the risk significantly for the customer. Imagine I am able to add a few new clients in the first 15 days...that's significant value-add.<p>Thirdly, I am sure you guys have thought about this already but I can see other things like 'recommended keywords' based on 'successful keywords' that the user has chosen. Those can be derived by finding a 'high correlation' between those keywords and other successful keywords chosen by other users for example.<p>Fourth, I am not too perturbed by your site design. You can always do a re-design, I would focus more on adding features to the $20 account, because it seems a little feature light at the moment.<p>That's all I can think of right now. Good job. I would love if when I am ready to use it (maybe a few months from now) I could get the 7-day free trial...or who knows maybe by then you have implemented a 15-day free trial on all accounts :)<p>One last thing...did you find the cofounder you were looking for and did you go it alone on this project? Would love a similar post to your hiphopgoblin post :)",1255303012

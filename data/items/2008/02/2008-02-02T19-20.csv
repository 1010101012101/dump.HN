True, most of them never click through, and most of the ones who do never stick, but if you even get 50 customers out of it that's pretty sweet given that it takes zero time on your part. I wouldn't recommend putting a lot of effort into getting Crunched or Dugg, but it's certainly a good thing when it happens.<p>You'd also be amazed how many people contact you after a TechCrunch. Dell salesmen, other people in your niche, and all sorts of assorted nutjobs wanting to partner with you or sell you something you don't need. I don't know of anyone who got anything useful that way, but I'm sure it's happened.<p>I'm told there was a day when being featured there meant something, and instead of crazies contacting you it was investors, but those are long gone. Still, it's certainly not bad.",1201979569

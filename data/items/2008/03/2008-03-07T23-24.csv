Of course, I have no idea how severely the credit problems will impact high tech - I could guess, but so could any other astute reader of the newspaper.<p>Personally, I think that if fears like this are enough to send you packing to a bigcorp, then you should probably be working for a bigcorp.  This doesn't mean you're uncreative or overly fearful, bu the way.  I've worked for bigcorps, and they actually aren't terrible (though I did work for Sun Micro, which is (or at least was) very laid back for a bigcorp).  But I have so much more impact on the small startup-ish company I work for now.<p>If you want to live in the edgier world of startups and small companies, well then you're going to have to stare down some fears.  These fears aren't meaningless.",1204934394

One of their #1 knocks on me at the time was that I wasn't married.<p>Marriage showed stability, it showed you were multi-dimensional, that you had a built in support group, and that you weren't too much of a risk taker.<p>When you relate that back to the situation at hand, I think you want people who have something to lose, but at the same time have an understanding that there are other important things in life that need to be appreciated and respected.<p>Workaholics tend not to have this, and because of that they often make one-dimensional decisions, get burnt out, and over exert themselves in the wrong direction.",1204933920

I once worked for a company that didn't have a supply room (with markers, pens, etc) because they were afraid too much of it went to waste. So if you needed a marker you needed to make a request, get it approved and then someone would get you a marker.<p>Having your $150/hr consultant have to run around and figure out what they need to do to get a marker does NOT save you money. Often times there is a trade off between money you spend to buy things and time your employees otherwise need to spend to compensate. EMPLOYEES ARE NOT CHEAP.<p>Outsource the parts that are not core to your business, and buy the things you can afford to buy so you can focus your time (and the time of your employees) on actually creating value for your users (and company).",1204932551

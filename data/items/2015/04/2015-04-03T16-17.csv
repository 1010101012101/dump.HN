9316973,comment,9315734,9315734,0,0,interactually,,,"Just a few more bits of creepiness that have happened since I wrote this article a couple years ago:<p>- My wife signed up for LinkedIn years ago with her work email but never added any connections. She got an email to her personal email address from LinkedIn saying &quot;David Veldt is inviting you to join LinkedIn!&quot; I have no permissions that I could find set to allow such a thing.<p>- Just in the past week, two people have requested to connect with me that I haven&#x27;t seen in over 10 years and live a couple states away from. Our only &quot;connection&quot; is that we&#x27;re Facebook friends. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m in their contacts list. I find it highly unlikely that they&#x27;ve searched or viewed my profile because we have absolutely nothing in common.<p>- The thing lately that pisses me off the most is how much they&#x27;re trying to get me to mindlessly give them access to my contact list. On the app, sometimes a screen pops up when I open it to &quot;Find more connections&quot; but turns out they want authorization for my address book. Same thing on the notifications; they show a notification in the connections icon which usually indicates someone wants to connect, but instead its just a generic &quot;hey, we can find you more of these!&quot; type of notification. Reminds me of the cartoons where the salesman keeps popping up from laundry hampers and behind trees.<p>Might be time for a follow-up article.",1428080348

I started my career at your age as well, mostly building websites for friends and family.<p>As mentioned in previous comments, there are US laws that stand in the way of companies actually hiring you, and nobody wants to break the law.<p>It might be a good idea for you and your parents to look up what exactly the US laws are that apply to your situation. Some online research might answer that question or you can send a quick note to your family attorney.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a family attorney I&#x27;d be happy to put you in touch with my attorney, he started coding at your age too and I&#x27;m sure he could point you in the right direction.<p>That will tell you exactly who can and can not hire you and take that hurdle of research out of the negotiation process with potential employers.<p>After you know the legal details I would start looking in your direct surroundings for opportunities ( friends, family, classmates, classmates&#x27; parents, etc ) or with smaller companies that are more flexible to make changes accommodating a minor ( e.g. getting rid of the beer fridge temporarily ).<p>For example, I run a small engineering studio in Los Angeles, it would be easy for me to get rid of all of our beer compared to a big corporation that might have to make more extensive changes to their offices and have a request like this pass through many layers of corporate bureaucracy.<p>Good luck!",1428080340
9316971,comment,9316191,9316191,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Whenever I think back on this era in computing history, I think it&#x27;s almost miraculous that I get to work on a UNIX(ish) system (Linux). The incredible hubris of so many of the companies involved in UNIX back then, and the greedy grasping over scraps, rather than focusing on growing the market and interoperability, is astonishing. Sure, they eventually recognized the massive failure and founded some things with &quot;Open&quot; in the name, to at least present the illusion of &quot;getting it&quot;. But, the reality is that it took actual Open Source to save UNIX from being yet another also-ran system. And, it almost seems like an accident of history that we have Linux (I mean, what if Linus hadn&#x27;t posted what he did when he did about his little &quot;toy&quot; OS, and what if several others hadn&#x27;t started sending patches?).<p>I also occasionally wonder what has been lost to similar accidents of history. I know there are folks out there who considered UNIX inferior to VMS, for example. What if VMS had been subject to the same licensing quirk that UNIX was and was able to be produced by many vendors and eventually and Open Source version? Would we be using &quot;Livax&quot; today?",1428080324

For example, the vast majority of ng-repeat related concepts is completely non-portable (think `ng-repeat-start`, `track by`, `(x, y) in foo`, `$index`, etc). You learn that `ng-repeat=&quot;x in foo | filter: bar&quot;` is equivalent to a for loop that displays only some items, but you can&#x27;t really apply that knowledge anywhere outside of Angular.<p>You can&#x27;t reuse your basic knowledge of for loops and if statements coming into Angular, and you can&#x27;t use your knowledge about the pipe syntax anywhere else when you leave Angular.<p>In contrast, a framework that employs `.map` and `.filter` might teach you a bit about FP, and this is something you can use in Angular, Ember, React, and even vanilla js.",1428080237

The reason the explicit floating point formula doesn&#x27;t get used is because you need as many bits of floating point as you expect to get bits of answer.

We&#x27;re the main contributors to Cloud Foundry, which is a PaaS that can be deployed to private and public clouds.<p>PaaSes are more than &quot;deploy and wire the app&quot;; there&#x27;s actually an eye-blistering amount of complexity below the hood.<p>If you&#x27;re prepared to ignore legacy, sure, all that complexity goes away. But so does a lot of accumulated capital in the form of existing software.<p>That being said, I think unikernels are a very promising line of attack on service isolation that warrant further effort. I spent some time last week poking around the Cloud Foundry codebase looking for places to inject changes.<p>My first impression[0] was that Diego would need some additions. That&#x27;s still true, but I think that the logic changes are going to be less about the Diego Executor (which mostly knows how to drive Garden-managed containers) and more about introducing a new Stager backend[1]<p>I also now think that there&#x27;d need to be a Xen backend for Garden. So long as you implement the generic Garden API[2], Diego can use that to create and manage what it thinks of as containers.<p>During my free time last week I deliberately went looking for &quot;architecture-busters&quot;, use cases and application platforms that strain or break how the Cloud Foundry architecture works.<p>Unikernels are one of the best examples I came up with. They severely stretch the architecture at staging time. But they also show the strengths of the Diego/CF architecture, which is in fact totally agnostic of containerisation strategies. That&#x27;s why Diego allows CF to run buildpacks and mount Docker containers currently. It&#x27;s why .NET applications are close behind and why unikernels are actually a legitimate possibility.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9264241"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9264241</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stager/tree/master/backend"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stager/tree/master...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden"" rel=""nofollow"">http://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden</a>",1428079823

Its possible to run XP on a lot of modern hardware because companies like nvidia continue to make drivers for XP. That is not possible with any linux distribution from that time frame.<p>The opposite also exists, I have a baytrail tablet I picked up over Christmas. It runs win8.1 just fine, and will sort of boot the latest bleeding edge ubuntu, but the wifi still doesn&#x27;t work (as of a couple weeks ago), nor does the SD controller, and a few other things are suboptimal.<p>There are also whole product lines that still don&#x27;t work in linux (see the USB3 displaylink based products) even years after their initial release.<p>Plus, linux tends to put users in a sticky situation. For example at work I have a fairly recent intel based platform, that doesn&#x27;t work 100% in the older (still supported) SLES environment we use by default. That is because the drivers need to be backported by SUSE and they aren&#x27;t exactly on the ball about it (same thing for the LTS releases of ubuntu).<p>I&#x27;m a pretty strong believer that linux needs to decouple the drivers from the core kernel. I don&#x27;t necessarily want to upgrade my whole OS platform just because I got a new piece of hardware. This is especially true on stable platforms.

I personally think that immutability is an important component of building modern distributed systems (things that are in production should be as immutable as possible; we&#x27;ve even experimented with reverting machines to initial state on a rolling basis, for example). If you have stateless services, it makes sense to constantly bring up boxes that are at the initial state as memory leaks or other errors compound over time.<p>At Terminal we do this by having RAM-perfect snapshots (think VMWare style snapshots, but without a hypervisor) and rolling new instances from an initial state. The snapshotting works by taking the RAM-state, CPU cache and Disk state at a given moment and committing it to Disk for later restoration. Once you have the primitive of being able to treat machine state like a file system, you get a lot of properties that you  might not otherwise have access to (like being able to bring up machines with state in the time it takes to read the RAM from disk).<p>I am overall quite bullish on Unikernels, but I do think there&#x27;s quite a bit of distance to cover between where we are now and where companies will feel comfortable trusting their infrastructure to MirageOS.<p>I am particularly interested in running MirageOS without a hypervisor, but I understand why that&#x27;s not yet possible (please do correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). If MirageOS is running in a container somewhere, I&#x27;d like to see it.<p>[0]<a href=""http://devops.com/blogs/docker-leaving-immutable-infrastructure-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devops.com/blogs/docker-leaving-immutable-infrastruct...</a>",1428079364

That said, it is fast becoming a standard measure, and any savvy display advertiser will be using it.  At the end of the day, the ones most at risk are brand advertisers who aren&#x27;t running direct response campaigns.  They may have ad recall studies and Marketing Mix Modeling setups that give them some visibility, but there will always be some inventory wasted at the scale those advertisers are dealing with.<p>For direct response advertisers, things are getting better. While it may be harder to target some segments, and that % may be growing, the tools advertisers have available to them simply did not exist even a few years ago.<p>Take for example Google Analytics attribution and multi-channel reports.  They have made a basic cross-channel attribution toolset available. To everyone. For free. Think about where the industry was even five years ago and let the impact of that sink in.<p>Facebook&#x27;s acquisition of Atlas, Google&#x27;s acquisition of Adometry, and other recent acquisitions in the bid management/dedicated attribution platform space are all pointing in one direction: better visibility into the contribution of your individual efforts.<p>I manage digital advertising for a living and have done so both client-side and at a top agency in the space.  When it comes to the space, and in my not-so-humble opinion, the #1 thing clients wanted (and that I want doubly so now that I&#x27;m client-side) is better attribution.<p>When you are sitting on the types of data FB and Google are, you have many pieces of that puzzle, particularly the cross-channel and cross-device pieces.  You also have the statistician brainpower and engineering talent to create the modeling tools that can give this visibility to advertisers.  Why they haven&#x27;t pushed harder on making that data visible is anyone&#x27;s guess (I do wonder about how any negative revelations might impact their business), but the acquisitions seem like a big step in the right direction.<p>That said, digital media needs to go beyond static attribution models like: linear decay, time decay, U-shaped, first touch, last touch, etc.  Instead, it needs to move more to the dynamic models, where data is assessed at the individual conversion path level.  When you look at attribution at the channel or even campaign level, you are missing a ton of the story since the impact of say, a generic video ad vs. a laser-targeted retargeting ad can be night and day.  Sure you might want to see channel data in aggregate, but you can&#x27;t effectively optimize much at that level.<p>The advertising bubble savvy individuals in this industry are aware of those is video advertising.  There&#x27;s been a big hype train, CPMs are frothy, and everyone is switching to some sort of auto-play/auto-play-next-video format.  Personally, I&#x27;m not convinced the value is really there at many of these CPMs, but I test and let the data decide.<p>The best thing companies like Google and Facebook can do to safeguard against any growing mistrust of online advertising efficacy is to keep improving their attribution tools, particularly for display and view-through performance.<p>Knowing what I do about the data available to me and its strengths/weaknesses I sometimes wish I was back in the days of last-touch models.  There&#x27;s few things as painful for me as knowing that better data exists to optimize against, but not having all the tools I need to get it because they are prohibitively expensive still for many budgets.",1428078777

When I started there were framework like YUI, Ext.js, SproutCore which were... well... complicated and locking you up.<p>After that I found Backbone.js and it just clicked. Most of the code produced for it is pretty portable, as there not much of framework given to begin with. So it was very easy to start hacking with.<p>Small size of Backbone.js comes at its own costs, like lack of memory-management. But with small apps memory management should not be a problem, and by the time it become a problem, you probably will understand issues at hands well enough, as well as will be aware of Marionette.js.<p>Backbone.js/Marionette.js (and similar size frameworks like Mithril.js) still requires quite a lot of boilerplate code, that what react.js and higher level frameworks try to solve, each in their own way. So by that time you either find one to fit how your brain works, or find your own combination of lower level components which essentially will form your own framework, which you will understand very well by that time.<p>That is my vision. Why I tried to warn about angular - while most of the terminology/architecture choices you learn from most client-side frameworks are very transferable to others, angular&#x27;s - does not. Therefore knowing angular is important if you day job is UI engineer, since it is very popular choice, especially in corporate environment lately, I would not recommend it as very first and, especially, the only one, framework to learn.

And so were startups and large companies to be honest. Unfortunately most of the large companies I have worked for have rules about hiring or even having people younger than 18 on premise for work purposes due to insurance and liability reasons. Many of the start ups would not hire anyone under 21. They state it is for the insurance and liability reasons but in actuality it is due to the fact that many have a &quot;beer fridge&quot; or go out drinking quite a bit and do not want the liability of an under aged employees.<p>With that said, there is hope. First off, many companies are lax in their HR departments and you might just slip through if you have the right connections. This means hustling as has been suggested: getting emails for employees, showing them your ambition and character and drive, and getting a foot in the door. This may turn into a frustrating endeavor as you might be rejected a few times, but it could work with perseverance.<p>Second, what makes you think you need an internship at all? You have skills, start something yourself. Maybe you want to freelance for a while, this could make for a lucrative summer experience and you will learn amazing skills that will stick with you the rest of your life.

I agree with the OP that Angular, in particular, has a great deal of vocabulary to learn and a lot of things that are only applicable in the Angular world. This is one of the main reasons that I, and many other folks, have not spent much time with it.<p>> <i>The third point, in particular, is fundamentally what a framework does... it does some &quot;magic&quot; in the background to prevent you from HAVING to understand what&#x27;s going on in the background.</i><p>Just because you don&#x27;t take the time to understand what&#x27;s going on the background, doesn&#x27;t mean the framework is &quot;preventing&quot; you from you having to understand what&#x27;s going on in the background. Au contraire, we hear stories over and over about how the &quot;magic&quot; introduced by a framework caused issues that actually <i>required</i> knowledge of what&#x27;s going on in the background. This isn&#x27;t the fault of the framework, or the goal of the framework, it&#x27;s a fundamental part of software development.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, you&#x27;re contradicting yourself by saying that &quot;literally every framework ever created&quot; applies to the OP&#x27;s points, yet concede in your own point that &quot;This does not necessarily translate from one framework to another, but can.&quot;<p>Frameworks get in your way only as much as you let them. The underlying technologies are still there.<p>> <i>In the same way that learning Rails is not learning Ruby</i><p>Learning Rails is a perfectly fine way to be introduced to Ruby. You&#x27;re learning syntax, constructs, philosophies, and you can break out of Rails and do things with Ruby at any time. I mean, what do you think you&#x27;re writing Rails code in?<p>When learning to counter an argument, its best if you don&#x27;t reiterate all of the points they made in some other way.

Angular 2, which is in the development right now, totally different.</i><p>Your point:<p>>  <i>Angular 2, an in-development long-term replacement for Angular 1 uses a very different approach to development, and will not translate well from 1.x to 2.x</i><p>OP:<p>> <i>Much of the code abstracts away the DOM and some Javscript nuances, so don&#x27;t expect learning a front-end framework to be the same as learning JS</i><p>Your point:<p>> <i>Knowledge you learn from using Angular is unlikely to be applicable to any other client-side framework, as original creators invented many new terminology as well as their approach to many things is unique</i><p>OP:<p>> <i>A lot of &quot;magic&quot; will prevent you from understanding what is really going on behind scene.</i><p>Your point:<p>> <i>Much of the code abstracts away the DOM and some Javscript nuances, so don&#x27;t expect learning a front-end framework to be the same as learning JS</i><p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear some valid counterpoints to the OP, since I tend to agree with them, but these don&#x27;t appear to be them.",1428078006

Tesla gained from that — fact. &quot;Reasonable&quot; is very ambiguous word, and it is a shame that some judge can decide what is reasonable and what isn&#x27;t, but I would say that an investor (and it doesn&#x27;t mater if it&#x27;s a human, a company or a machine) who makes money by <i>investing</i> on daily basis can be called reasonable as a matter of fact. And the likelihood of it altering the price turned to be substantial indeed, as we can judge by what happened. I think that &quot;jokes&quot; like that can and should be viewed as fraud, and it should be punished. After all it&#x27;s not like serious shit doesn&#x27;t happen on 1st of April.",1428077802

    this.loading = true;
    this.errorMsg = null;
    this.data = null;
    this.condition1 = null;
    this.condition2 = null;
    this.something = null;
  }

  onSuccess(data) {
    this.loading = false;
    this.errorMsg = null;
    this.data = data;
    this.condition1 = data.blah === &#x27;Hello&#x27;;
    this.condition2 = data.blah2 === &#x27;World&#x27;;
    this.something = data.something;
  }

  onFailure(errorMsg) {
    this.loading = false;
    this.errorMsg = errorMsg;
    this.data = null;
    this.condition1 = null;
    this.condition2 = null;
    this.something = null;
  }
</code></pre>
If for some reason I was feeling crazy and I wanted the store to handle a second Ajax call, the store code becomes much more cumbersome so I avoid this.<p>Even with some of the slicker Flux implementations, I still have tons more boilerplate than a traditional MVC app which for the simple UIs makes the code more difficult to reason about. For example, I find that in my store, I frequently forget to &quot;reset&quot; some property thus making the state &quot;invalid&quot;. I&#x27;ve come up with this type of pattern, but it just feels... odd:<p><pre><code>  resetInitialState() {
    this.loading = false;
    this.errorMsg = null;
    this.data = null;
    this.condition1 = null;
    this.condition2 = null;
    this.something = null;

  onFailure(errorMsg) {
    this.resetInitialState();

That being said, I will try to explain the process that one VERY large company (>10k employees) used.<p>Even though I was effectively hired by a senior executive (former colleague), I still had to become an approved contractor in their procurement system. They used a 3rd party (<a href=""http://www.pontoonsolutions.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pontoonsolutions.com</a>).  So, I was instructed to make a proposal via that system -- to be clear, though, I had already negotiated everything before this even came up -- but it was a requirement to get the work.<p>However, once I was in, I had visibility to other work that was being put out for bid.  I personally was fully booked up with work from my network in this company to take advantage of it though.  My sense is that it would not be a good idea to bid blindly for these projects -- most of them were commodity IT work, not necessarily interesting projects.  I found out about those from my internal networking.<p>So, I guess I would suggest looking at Pontoon -- seeing if there&#x27;s a way into companies through 3rd parties like this.<p>I would also suggest just looking at giant company career sites and seeing if they have any contractor positions listed.  Once you are in, you can find other projects.  The easy networking you can do is with the company&#x27;s recruiters (they probably call you) -- find out how they hire contractors.",1428077566

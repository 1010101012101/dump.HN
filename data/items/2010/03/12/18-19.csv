Oh, wait...</i><p>Well, that's just a stupid implementation. You evidently should only be cleared once for any NHS facility and anyway, screening a paediatrician is not that useful because (a) they don't  typically have uncontrolled access to children and (b) if you are a paedophile, putting yourself through med school just to have access to children is really beyond unlikely.<p>I think the fact that there is a media hysteria is blinding people to the actual issue - that's just like saying ""PETA is nuts, let's all have battery-farmed chicken"". Many people correctly assume that paedophilia is rare (it is). Also, not many people have unsupervised access to children (in fact only childcare workers, educators and priests typically do). So people put two and two together and say ""a childcarer who is a paedophile is a very rare event"".  But that assumes that the chance of being a paedophile and the chance of having access to children are statistically independent events. They are not - as this well publicised case shows:<p><a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8284192.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8284192.stm</a><p>Moreover, the ""leverage"" of the event is quite high. This is the same problem with plane crashes; they are rare, but when they happen, 300 people die.<p>You would be amazed how many professions in the UK require background checks. Did you know you need a background check to work at the Meteorological Office?<p>And many, many people on HN are working the US on immigrant visas. Frankly if you have been able to get a job without a background check or a drug test or a work permit, you're pretty lucky.<p><i>How much do you spend on rare event insurance? You read HN so it's a fair bet you earn living from computing, so you'll have particular insurance against losing or damaging your hands, yes?</i><p>Well losing my hands is just a sub-class of {unable to work for any reason} so no, I don't have specific insurance against that (though for example, more than one famous violinist or pianist does - because their lifetime earning loss is much greater). But when I was pregnant I got screened for cystic fibrosis. That's pretty damn rare. You'd be amazed if you thought about it, how many rare events you insure against. For example, the chance of your house burning down is actually very small. Yet most homeowners have fire insurance.",1268420250

1187467,comment,1186958,1186958,0,0,jwecker,,,"Not only is this a violation of Fitt's law- it's practically the canonical example of how to violate it.  That is, when an application is maximized the exact upper corners of the screen become incredibly valuable because a user can get there without aiming but just by flicking the mouse in the general direction.  Flick it to the upper left and click for all window controls, flick it to the upper right and click to close.<p>I remember when Microsoft made it so that you had to go to the corner but then pull it back several pixels, thus destroying forcing you to aim the mouse cursor.  It may sound like a silly little thing, but I thought at the time that it was a good metaphor for how they could get something to _look_ similar (to, say, a mac) and yet still get it completely wrong.  When I switched to linux around the same time I thought it was so refreshing that the UIs of the time (minus some skins people had made) didn't violate this example of Fitt's law, and also that if anyone were dumb enough to change that in the future, we could all just fix it.<p>I usually disregard comments about linux desktops copying window's mistakes, but this is just very irritating to me, mostly because it's elective- it's like you actually have to _try_ to get it wrong.",1268420082

Just that users don't have to manage files.</i><p>I have had the following conversation multiple times in my career:<p><pre><code>   ""I can not find the file I worked on yesterday.  It \n      was right here before.""    \n   ""What did you name it?""   \n   ""I don't know.""  \n   ""You don't know what you named the file?  Okay, then \n      where did you put it?""\n   ""I didn't put it anywhere, I saved it where all my \n      files are saved.""\n   ""Okay, then what program did you use to create it?""\n   ""I don't remember.""\n</code></pre>\nBased on my experience, <i>just</i> needing to remember which application the file is for and the name of a file isn't enough.<p>And then this ""feature"" would negate the majority of the reason to use computers: the ability to share files, both between users and between programs.  If you need to use Excel to even <i>find</i> the spreadsheet you want to insert into your Word document, with the divergent interfaces that multiple programs would have for this ability, it would get even more confusing.  Rather than a single ""attach a file"" functionality in an email program, you need to provide email functionality to each program.  Now admittedly, Android does offer something like that, many applications have a ""share"" function that lets you select how you want to share something with users, but you can still browse for files when attaching, but the base is still files that can be individually manipulated without the original program.",1268417737

However, that doesn't mean they have the same question, because that question has a variable in it: ""I"".  The laptop <i>I</i> buy as a computing professional will differ greatly from the laptop someone else might buy.<p>I think you want to direct all people with that question to the same page, but then make it easy to distinguish themselves and their criteria with simple statements.  For instance, under ""Which laptop should I buy?"", you could then have distinguishing statements like ""I use my laptop more/less than 8 hours a day."" or ""I care more about weight/screen size."".  Make a game out of it, and simplify the ranking process as much as possible.  For instance, put the question at the top (""What laptop should I buy?""), put two ""person"" icons on either side of the page each with a speech bubble saying ""I use my laptop more than 8 hours a day."" and ""I use my laptop less than 8 hours a day."".  Then, users can drag laptops under the left or right user icon depending on which statement fits the laptop better.<p>You don't necessarily even need opposing statements on the same axis; if you let users categorize laptops between any two arbitrary statements, you then have the information that user U believes laptop L better fits statement S1 than statement S2.  Put enough of those together and you can derive some useful information.<p>Then, when a user wants to <i>ask</i> the question ""which laptop should I get?"", they can rank some statements they agree with, and get a laptop that fits those statements.",1268417229

It's also very low on the priority list of most hiring managers within the recruitment industry. The number 1 priority is finding people with solid recruitment experience, priority number 2 is finding people who can bring existing client relationships with them, priority number 3 is finding people who are incredibly driven and want to make a lot of money. Technical capability struggles to break the top ten in terms of priority.<p><i>It feels like the recruitment industry in general is very cut throat and has high turnover.</i><p>100% accurate. I've never worked in a career where I've felt as insecure as I do in recruitment. Despite making my company a <i>lot</i> of money this year I am constantly looking over my shoulder as the age old adage is that you are only as good as your last deal. My technical competency counts for very little when it comes to my bosses perspective on how valuable I am to the business despite the fact that my technical competence is what sets me ahead of most other recruiters.",1321348368

Nokia is a monster amongst phone makers and they weren't able to make their own OS, even when their own survival depended on it. These companies using Android depend on base Android to remain open-source, they made an investment in Android <i>because</i> it was supposed to be an open standard, which is why Google must also play nice, otherwise they risk forks. And in case you haven't noticed, Amazon just forked Android, so it's not unheard of.<p>You see, forks from small players cannot survive because they'll lack the advantages of the main branch (especially the Marketplace). On the other hand, Google must play nice because a fork coming from an alliance between several of these players can kill the main branch.<p><pre><code>    Imagine if many cheap Chinese manufacturers release \n    decent phones with it, that cost 3x cheaper than \n    the rest\n</code></pre>\nConsidering that most phone manufacturers are assembling their phones in China, what would prevent them from also releasing cheap phones?<p>Also, most people don't want cheap. Most people want reliable and affordable, which is why iPhones and Galaxy S2 are selling quite well, even though there are cheaper alternatives on the market, even from trusted brands. Consumers don't want the cheapest products, instead they want the best value/price ratio (as long as they can afford it). Making an analogy with cars, there's always going to be a big market for Audi, BMW and Mercedes. Some people even prefer to buy second-hand cars from these brands, instead of a cheaper but out-of-the-factory alternative. That says a lot.",1321348011

4480237,comment,4480009,4480009,18,0,rm999,,,"I have an academic and professional background in traditional AI, and I've programmed an AI for a 3D video game I made in college. My traditional AI background is mostly in applying a wide variety of mainstream machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, SVMs, and regression, to real world problems like fraud and image detection. I was somewhat frustrated when building the game AI because the best solution came down to building a large state machine with hard-coded logic. The AI was dead-simple, but it worked well and wasn't too far from state of the art in video game AIs at the time, and I suspect today.<p>I agree with the general point of this article; in fact, I think it understates the case. When people want AI in video games they want the AI to be truly smart. The fact is, we haven't cracked ""intelligence"" yet. Most of 'AI' research has veered into machine learning, which is basically applied statistics. While this algorithms can solve many constrained problems quite well (this field powers much of google search) it's tough to frame complex problems like a 3D FPS AI, into a simple statistical framework. Even biologically-inspired AIs like neural networks are designed to solve highly constrained problems. In short, I don't think it's possible to even design a non-bruteforce AI, regardless of computational power, with what we currently know.",1346864399

Startup School is by far the best startup conference in the Bay Area, and I say that as a 20-something startup founder that mostly still finds increased social connection with 20-something startup founders more compared to wizened 30-something serial entrepreneurs, media people, employees, and successful failures. It's a good thing Startup School is going to get a lot bigger this year because it's unfortunate that so many people always were rejected.<p>It's actually very difficult to find a venue of this size in the Bay Area, though particularly in San Francisco.

This is and always has been the deciding factor.<p>When Amazon was ""just"" an online ""catalog"", it could take advantage of cases like <i>Quill Corp,</i> which held that a catalog with no physical presence in a state <i>and which sold few goods into that state</i> did not have sufficient nexus to establish the state's jurisdiction to tax.<p>However, Amazon is the single largest retailer by volume in nearly every state in America, topped only by Walmart.  It sells a substantial volume of goods into <i>every single state</i>.  Legal commentators, including numerous former SCOTUS law clerks, have noted that if Amazon were to challenge state sales taxation today, <i>it would lose</i> because the justification set forth in <i>Quill</i> does not apply.

4480192,comment,4479475,4479554,3,0,Lewisham,,,"<i>Nokia's new phones look fantastic. But their last ones looked fantastic, too.</i><p>I think this totally sums up Nokia (and Microsoft's) predicament. They're doing all the right things, and they still can't seem to catch a break.<p>Google's tactic of putting Android in the hands of companies who were being heavily burned by iPhone gave them ubiquity, and in America at least, the AT&T deal probably did more harm than good for Apple by forcing Verizon to push Android hard.<p>Now we have this two horse system: one that has all the apps  and the cachet, one that has the rest of the handsets (and, with Jelly Bean, is really a strong offering against iOS) and there just isn't any room left for Nokia or WP8. I think Nokia is going to have to step into the Windows RT ring this holiday.<p>Microsoft thinks it knows how to play this game from its Xbox days: buy out developers until you get enough mass to make consumers stick. But the game is different when you have carriers screwing things up for you (no Nokia on Verizon this year, carriers blocking OTA patches) and a platform that is driven by app numbers rather than by hits in the same way the games industry is. It doesn't help that web startups are hitching their horse to iOS and then begrudgingly offer Android later (I'm looking at you Mint and Simple). Windows Phone just isn't in their roadmap anywhere.<p>My guess is the fate of Windows Phone and Nokia is probably tied to the success of Windows 8. If Windows 8 takes off, Windows Phone will get a halo effect and sales of that will follow. But even then, I think consumers are going to be weirded out by the fact that the stuff they have on their Windows 8 tablet <i>doesn't</i> appear on their Windows Phone 8 handset.",1346863749

I recently purchased a new speciality car last year (2012 Jeep SRT8) and I must of said at least 10 times during the process that I wish there was a way to circumvent the dealer. Dealing with car dealers is one of the most fundamentally broken experiences I have ever witnessed.<p>Ready to drop $65k on a new vehicle I walk into a dealer and the first thing that happens is the sales man walks me to a desk, pulls out a piece of paper and starts asking questions and writing ""whats your name?, how much do you want to spend per month?, what is credit like?, we can offer you really great financing."" I had to interrupt him to explain that I just wanted to have a normal conversation first to even see if he could get the car. Turns out they couldn't.<p>After many other slimy conversations with car dealers (and being hassled in the parking lot before I even walked in the door) I finally found a dealer that was willing to special order the car I wanted at the price I wanted. I waited 4 months for the car and 2 weeks before it was ready to arrive a the dealer they called to tell me they didn't want to sell it to me for that price anymore and they were going to sell it for $10,000 over MSRP. Long story short, I had to threaten legal action just to be able to buy the car that I had put a deposit on and waited for 4 months for.<p>This is not the first terrible experience I have had with buying cars. The ""car sales man"" attitude is fundamentally wrong. About 80% of the sales people that I talked to at dealerships did not even know about the car I wanted to buy, mentioned the wrong engine or did not even know it existed.<p>I'm waiting for the day that I can just click ""buy now"" online and purchase a car with Zappos-like customer support at one fair, up front, low price without all the bullshit in between.",1346863628

4480147,comment,4478786,4478786,1,0,leoh,,,"Interesting. This reminds me of a bug from a couple years ago. Apple used to leave a big unencrypted swap file on disk, so you would open up single user mode and search for string related to login and there would usually be a cache of logins and passwords in the clear. Apple fixed this bug by removing the swap file, among other things. But it turns out that there are ways to enable a dev representing virtual memory with some kernel hacking, that does something similar as the swap.<p>This vulnerability is fairly similar in that it involves scouring memory, is somewhat more sophisticated since it requires some decryption, but is less powerful since it relies on memory being intact, whereas the most common, illicit way to gain root access is by single user mode, which usually obliterates much memory. But it would be interesting to test--to preserve memory it would be best to set boot flags for single user and then restart as opposed to rebooting (presumably this would cut power to memory for a shorter period of time, thereby better preserving its contents).",1346863255

Now we know population is logistic [1], which looks like an exponential on the left side of the curve but flattens out on the right; you can see a very clear divergence from the exponential if you look at real data [2].  Human population growth passed its peak (annual growth of 1.1% down from 2.2% in the 60s; numerical growth of 75 mil down from 88 mil in the 80s [3]) and is on the way to leveling out at around 9 billion, or about 20% more than today's population [4].  Things that go along with population -- like waste production -- are, obviously, also not exponential.<p>Worrying about the consequences of exponential growth curves is like worrying that a potted plant is going to consume your entire house by the end of the month because it went from seed to sprout in just a few days.  The only reason the ""exponential"" myth persists is <i>scaremongering</i> and <i>willful ignorance</i>.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Po...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#In_ecology:_modeling_population_growth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#In_ecology:_m...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.growth-dynamics.com/articles/Kurzweil_files/image004.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.growth-dynamics.com/articles/Kurzweil_files/image...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth#Human_population_growth_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth#Human_populat...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growt...</a>",1346862527

This consists of all the bits of bureaucracy you need to keep your car on the road  weight tax, vehicle inspection and compulsory insurance (car tax and more comprehensive insurance coverage are separate). If you buy a new car, you have three years until you need to jump through the hoops and start forking over cash. After that, you have to do it every two years, and it can easily cost you over 100,000 yen each time.<p>The end result of this is that people tend to sell their cars when the shaken runs out. Dealers will usually arrange shaken so that potential buyers have two years to go  a big selling point in the secondhand market. The upshot of all this is that used cars will usually be available when they are 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 years old.

Not sure I'll explain it as well as I'd like but it goes something like this:<p>iPhone ""1"" is mind blowingly awesome. A fantastically complete device. Subsequent updates to the hardware and OS make meaningful but incremental improvements. So an original iPhone 1 is 80% of what a 5 will be.<p>Android early phones are fascinating but generally pretty average - especially compared to an iPhone. Yet/Therefore every new hw and OS update provides substantial improvements over what's come before.<p>Therefore two things happen. Android phones close the absolute gap to iPhone helping for competitive wins. Secondly, Android new/upgrade phones excite the heck out of existing Android owners because they (along with the OS) are a real improvement.<p>I see iPhone 5 sales driven by people who held off getting an iPhone for the last two months because of the news. I don't see that other afterburner of sales though - 4 and 4S users who see a real driver to upgrade.",1346861313

Salary is only one term in the overall equation.<p>Consider, for example, a company that buys you lunch. Here in NY, lunch costs about $10 if you buy it yourself. If you're in the 25% tax bracket, that's worth $3,300+ in salary.<p>Do they provide daycare? Transportation costs? Paying for conferences? 401k matching?<p>Your friends that feel underpaid did a poor job of negotiating their total compensation. Next time they should sit down and do something along the following lines:<p>- list out every possible benefit a company might offer<p>- group the ones they personally care about (don't have kids? Then the daycare benefit is worthless)<p>- for the ones they care about, think about how much each one is worth in $ to them.<p>- think about what the minimum they would accept for that benefit, how much would make them happy, and how much would make the ecstatic.<p>- for the ones they don't care about, thik about how much it costs the company to pay for each<p>When it comes time to negotiate your compensation, always think in sets. Always word things in terms of how moving any one piece requires movement on a different piece. Give up the things in the ""don't care"" set for the equivalent value of something in the ""want"" set.<p>If they want to give you less money, you say you could agree to that, if they give you X number of vacation days. Or if they say they have free daycare, you say that you appreciate that, but since you don't have kids you would rather have ""work at home Fridays"" and a slightly larger 401k match.<p>Consider the total You are much more likely to get a larger total if you don't focus only on the money.<p>[edit: bad math]<p><pre><code>  (salary equivalent) = (daily cost * 5 days/wk * 50 wks/yr)

                                   ( 1 - tax rate )

  25% tax bracket 
  $ 5 lunch = (5 * 5 * 50)/(75%) = $1,667 salary
  $10 lunch = $3,333

Specifically:<p>1) there are few programs in the entire US which have nuclear engineering degrees (MIT has one, I believe fewer than 10 others do too), a topic requiring a sufficiently broad range of skills that its almost like a fusion [sic] of solid state physics (for robust materials), electrohydrodynamics (to understand anything relating to fusion and plasma), numerical computing (analytic solutions to realistic PDEs is a funny idea sometimes), as well complete case analysis of all possible risk and failure modes via probabilistic model building (there is in fact dedicated software used to handle the complexity of these models). In short, do we have the educational capacity to train the people needed?<p>2) at least with how current nuclear regulation is structured (which would presumably have to change), technically any new reactor designs that get approved are  ""exemptions"" to a general ban, so theres actually a lot of time spent finaggling approval via a somewhat insidery process.<p>3) I want fusion thats commercially viable! :). The idea of having energy become functionally free and what would then be possible boggles my mind, and I don't think anyone can fully comprehend the myriad subtle ways in which the world would immediately change.

When you're working a dead-end job, being paid less than everyone at other companies, in an environment where even your chair is falling apart, doing the same thing you did last year and the year before, money becomes a very big issue.  It's why they pay people big bucks at banks to do COM/ATL programming.  No one wants to do it and everyone recognizes it.

The difference here is that it's a little easier for different codecs to coexist, even with varying licenses. The problem is that publishing shouldn't be limited to big players that can afford expensive and restrictive licensing agreements. There has to be a solution for the everyman, nonprofit, and nonprofessional. An unencumbered, nonrestrictive and free codec has to be an option, and Theora is one possiblility, if it can be easily supported in a product without worrying about licensing issues.",1265206055

Such licenses were not required for website owners or other GIF users who had used licensed software to generate GIFs.</i><p>Edit:<p>I am completely opposed to web standards including proprietary codecs. HTML5 should have Theora (or some other open gratis and libre codec) as the standard which all browsers wishing to be HTML5 compliant must be able to handle - this does not stop anyone from using h264 if they wish to. What it does is ensure that the web remains as free and open to use as possible.<p>If the working groups had plumped for Theora then optimisations and hardware would follow in pretty short shrift. It ain't going to happen and the reasons are commercial - this makes me sad for the future of the web, I see this is a big turning point. Kinda like if the developers of HTML4 had said ""we know about the LZW patent but we're going to write in GIF as the standard requirement"".<p>(Incidentally I gather that no image formats were written into the standards before?!).<p>So do you link to h264 videos from your intranet - want to buy a license for $10k? No? Switch to Theora as the best free alternative. OK, now none of the browsers support your video format natively. Congratulations you've been screwed again by MegaCorp.",1265206041

162908,comment,162680,162849,0,0,jacobolus,,,"The question is, what is an “obvious troll”, and when has it achieved its ends?  I would argue that the purpose of “trolling” is to derail an otherwise fruitful discussion or forum, causing it to devolve into pointless flaming.  Given that this discussion a) stayed respectful, and b) was generally insightful, I'd say that at best, this was a completely ineffective “troll”.",1208152083

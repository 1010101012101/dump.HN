Theater plays were staged publicly until at least 5th century B.C.<p>><i>And when they wanted to listen to music, they played it from sheets. Instead of just tuning into the radio. That's quality of consumption for you.</i><p>Indeed it is. Was this meant ironically?<p>><i>I.e. people will always complain about earlier times being better, even and especially so in those earlier times themselves.</i><p>And people might always have had a point. Depending on what they were complaining about. That we have used to be living in a time when this doesn't exist anymore, doesn't mean that their initial complain was bogus.<p>Matter of fact, it takes a lot of search for find people complaining about ""earlier times being better"" in earlier times. There are quotes complaining of decline, from Hesiodus to Plato to latin writers etc, but fewer and far between. And there was times like the enlightenment era or the modernist period where optimism and looking into the future was the prevalent emotion.<p>Nowadays, every 12 year old on YouTube laments that he wasn't born 30-40 years ago.",1361933987

5290243,comment,5289532,5289943,37,0,Daiz,,,"Okay then, you asked for it, so here you go.<p>>The important thing regarding our technologies, and the main point you have missed in your analysis, is that they are used for automatic image optimization to the lowest bitrate or file size possible, and not for encoding an image or video to a specific bitrate or file size.<p>This is <i>exactly</i> what the CRF mode in x264 is for. Now, in another comment you're claiming the following:<p>>The decision Beamr Video makes are ""smarter"" than x264's CRF mode, since they are based on a perceptual quality measure we have developed.<p>Let's see how well that measures up to reality then, shall we? For this comparison, I used the same four clips as earlier, and ran each of them against the following command line:<p><pre><code>  x264 --crf 18.5\n</code></pre>\nThat's it. Completely default settings, with the exception of setting the CRF to 18.5 for everything. This shall be our vanilla x264 equivalent of your <i>""technology that can adaptively reduce the bitrate of any clip to the minimum amount possible, while ensuring that quality of the output clip is perceptually identical to the quality of the input clip"".</i> Since we're using the same value for everything, it involves as much choosing on the user end as your service would. Now then, let's see how your ""smarter than CRF"" technology <i>actually</i> fares against x264's CRF. Here are the results:<p>* Clip 1 - <a href=""http://check2pic.ru/compare/26755/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://check2pic.ru/compare/26755/</a> (CRF 18.5 encode is ~11.7% smaller)<p>* Clip 2 - <a href=""http://check2pic.ru/compare/26756/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://check2pic.ru/compare/26756/</a> (CRF 18.5 encode is ~4.4% smaller)<p>* Clip 3 - <a href=""http://check2pic.ru/compare/26757/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://check2pic.ru/compare/26757/</a> (CRF 18.5 encode is ~17% smaller)<p>* Clip 4 - <a href=""http://check2pic.ru/compare/26758/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://check2pic.ru/compare/26758/</a> (CRF 18.5 encode is ~19.5% smaller)<p>( The full videos are available here: <a href=""http://blisswater.info/video/beamr/set3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blisswater.info/video/beamr/set3/</a> )<p>As we can see from the comparisons, x264, at defaults setting and CRF 18.5, can produce practically identical visual results (as in you wouldn't notice any quality difference in action), <i>while producing smaller bitrates all over the board</i>. Looks like your supposedly ""smarter than CRF"" technology for choosing bitrates isn't so smart after all, eh?<p>In short, even if you have developed some sort of quality-based bitrate-choosing technology of your own, in practice it still seems to lose consistently to x264's CRF mode (and since x264 actually allows you to control the CRF value, it's much more versatile than your ""no quality settings at all, we know best"" offering). As such, given the substantial claims about the capabilities of your technology, the Snake Oil verdict shall remain.",1361933950

5290239,comment,5287474,5289844,4,0,veidr,,,"In short: I hope you are right, because since 2006, Macs have been <i>far and away</i> the best general-purpose PCs ('trucks' in your parlance) on the market, and migrating off of the Mac and/or jailbreaking and bootlegging the OS and then running it on my own unsupported hardware, will be a major pain in the ass. Either options sucks.<p>But yep, Apple <i>could</i> do every single thing you say. Without breaking a sweat.<p>As for why? I think Apple would prefer that OS X <i>not</i> run on commodity PCs. They already take halfassed measures to control running OS X in a VM, and to prevent booting OS X on non-Apple hardware. If they could do that more reliably, they woudln't care about their slightly higher internal costs, and they <i>definitely</i> don't care about making life miserable for their developers (as I've witnessed being one for the past 12 years). But it's just a hard problem for them and a hard sell to existing users used to PCs being wide-open. But with every single iOS user they add, that sell gets one user easier.<p>I'd bet that within five years, the percentage of users running unapproved software [EDIT: somehow deleted 2nd half of this sentence:] on <i>new</i> Mac hardware will be about the same as it is on iOS today. It won't probably be <i>impossible</i>, just hard enough to not be feasible for most normal/busy people.<p>OK, that wasn't short, but in summary: The fact that Mac OS X has been the best power user OS for the last several years wasn't by design, it was just an accident of history and where they got their OS from. Apple doesn't give a fuck about power users, and Apple doesn't give a fuck about trucks. That market is just way too small for Apple to care about -- which is sad for those of us currently in that market.<p>Because if/when Apple finally abandons Intel and power users (timing that makes sense to me) it will be <i>years</i> before Ubuttnu or any other plausible player is anywere near as good as Mac OS X 10.7. 10.8 still has too many bugs and stability issues, but it will get there. Probably 10.9, too. But after that? I don't think anybody knows, but I am very skeptical.<p>(I think Microsoft will move in this direction, too, so those Surface RT users are probably right to worry.)",1361933882

I ended up having to pull out a number of things related to Mo' Creatures, a third party mod not included in FTB.<p>Compounding this, Mystcraft got an update in the modpack at exactly the time I was uploading, so versions were mismatched between my local save files and the server's modpack version. I ended up needing to use an NBT editor to remove all kinds of references to dimensions that for whatever reason didn't play nice.<p>Having the server output logs available and having the ability to edit individual files in the save would have simplified this step.<p>3) I had gotten used to having Rei's Minimap display entity radar, but the modpack's SMP version doesn't support setting the MOTD the way it needs to be set to enable that.

(Many mail hosts do not re-send from the same IP, meaning messages essentially get stuck forever.)  Doing spam checks at DATA time and rejecting obviously bad emails outright seemed much more effective and less dangerous.  I never managed to get Spamassassin to do this, but auto-rejecting languages you don't read also cuts down on spam a lot.<p>(I missed out on a consulting opportunity because the client's host of choice seemed to be a known spammer and my mail server's filtering was too aggressive about trusting blacklists.  I chose to silently-reject those types of messages, so nobody got a bounce.  Fortunately, someone was nice enough to ask me about it out-of-band so at least I was able to turn off greylisting and blacklisting before losing much more mail.)<p>I never found an imapd that scaled to having a lot of messages in a folder, so I ran a cron-job to move mail offline after 2 weeks (for mailing lists) and 1 year (for INBOX).  Similarly, I never found a good client to use; Gnus had a very cryptic configuration that I could never believe worked, and mutt was not Emacs-y enough.  Reading my email mostly consisted of waiting for Gnus and deleting spam.  (I never figured out a good way to get Gnus to move messages marked as spam somewhere so that I could run a cron job to automatically train Spamassassin on the known-bad emails.<p>For search, I used HyperEstraier: <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/hyperestraier/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hyperestraier/</a><p>You set it up to run the ingestion program as a cron job every 10 minutes, and then you get a CGI that will show you matching emails for your query.  Of course, you can't actually click the links and go anywhere unless you set up some sort of web-based email viewer.  I never found anything I liked so I lived without webmail.  (There are lots of options.  All difficult to configure and probably riddled with security holes.)<p>Once your server is up and running, you need a secondary MX and a backup plan for your email.  (I used Dyn.com's secondary MX hosting service.  A lot of spam comes in through the secondary MX, so you can't just implicitly trust it.  This involves more configuration.)<p>Finally, spam filtering uses a lot of CPU and RAM, so you have to pay for a rather expensive virtual machine.  Linode's $40/month plan seemed mostly adequate.<p>I don't really like composing email in the web browser, but I've gotten used to it and $5/month for Gmail and $0/month of my time screwing around with spam filters seemed like a good tradeoff.",1361932337

5290101,comment,5289472,5289993,10,0,Bockit,,,"You've pretty much hit the nail on the head with the collection of mods comment. Some add major new features and tons of content, others are add-ons to the bigger mods adding a couple of new items that fit in another mod's theme. My understanding is that it started off as a collection of mods that the curators managed to make work together.<p>In its current state, it's a launcher for clients, essentially a package manager for minecraft mods, with several public packages available (Mindcrack, ftb) and also the ability to add private packages, or make your own by editing the existing ones.<p>What makes the mods special I guess is a combination of the sheer amount of content they add (energy systems, different realms with different monsters and bosses, more armour, ores, different biomes, beekeeping aka pokemon) and the way they all work together either by design or by glue mods.<p>Rather than reading up what all 30 mods do, I'd look at the following mods and see if any interest you. Please note, a lot of these mods add new types of resources to the new game, e.g., copper, silver, tin, lead, uranium, rubies.<p>Buildcraft + forrestry + thermal expansion: Buildcraft is one of what I consider the base mods, which adds the idea of energy called Minecraft Joules (MJ) which is used to power their machine blocks. Also adds pipes to transport items, liquids and energy. You can use these mods to do things like automatic tree farms, beekeeping, quarries (autmoatically mines out an area) lava pump.<p>Railcraft: Adds a couple of things that interact well with buildcraft, steam boilers, more buildcraft engines (engines generate MJ), liquid tanks (for storage) and tons of different rail stuff than in vanilla minecraft, e.g., launcher tracks, high speed rails, locomotives.<p>IndustrialCraft 2 and optionally Gregtech: Adds its own energy system, EU, which is used to power its own machine blocks. These machine blocks are all about item processing, e.g., getting ores and turning it into 2x or 3x as many ingots as you would have normally received in vanilla minecraft. Gregtech sort of extends this processing technology tree, adds some new items but also 'balances' all of the mods in the pack, editing their configurations so that they don't enable, in Greg's mind, an unfair amount of resources to be generated for a given period of time. Whether or not you agree with such a viewpoint is one of the distinguishing factors between the modpacks.<p>ComputerCraft: LUA programmable computers and 'turtles' (think logo) that can interact with the environment. MiscPeripherals is another mod that adds more methods for computers and turtles to interact with the minecraft environment and other mods.<p>Mystcraft: Adds the ability to generate new worlds, with funky settings like, multiple suns, always-night, dense ores, only plains biomes, purple sunset, and many more. Lets you teleport between realms.<p>Twilight Forest: A new realm, like the end or the nether, which is a more fantasy/magically oriented realm than normal minecraft, with entirely new creatures, monsters and bosses. I believe the idea behind it is if you're looking for a more magical setting than normal minecraft you could play entirely in this realm.<p>Extrabees: Really a small mod but has so much playtime involved. Forrestry adds beekeeping to the game, and extra bees adds a hundred or so more bees to the original 10-20 forrestry bees, with bees further down the evolutionary chain producing more advanced materials, e.g., diamonds. It also adds some machines to aid in the beekeeping process.<p>There are more mods worth talking about, but I should get back to work :) I'd watch some lets play videos on youtube to get more of a feel for what's going on. Just jumping into the game can be kind of overwhelming.",1361931513

I don't know the techincal details of this specific servo but it seemed to be a faily typical small servo. The servo arm is connected by twine through a series of braces to the fingertip. When this servo is actuated it pulls back on each finger opening the hand. All of this is hotglued to a work glove that can be worn.<p>For the demo at the hackathon we used a ping sensor to control the servo position. The closer the wearer moved their hand to the ping sensor, the more the hand was opened.

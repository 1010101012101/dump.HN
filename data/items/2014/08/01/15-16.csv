If I were to lose the new job, how hard will it be to find another one, and how similar/appealing will the new job be?

It&#x27;s easier to do more with a tiny team if you can batch work on a single site. Getting a good reputation in terms of quality and delivery was obviously very important there - you do not want to race to the bottom on prices.<p>Around 2008, shortly after the financial crisis, many business got into problems, often also because customers were insolvent.

Just like the PHP people who preemptively defend PHP in threads before it has been criticized.<p>The PHP people have an excuse though: they&#x27;re punch drunk from being constantly attacked. Attacking Russia is attacking from the herd, and very easy to do. The last thing anyone who cares about truth should be doing is discouraging dissent from the herd.<p>I have to say that the tradition of accusing people of setting up false equivalences by daring to even compare any aspect of <i>America the Incomparable</i> to places like Iran, Russia, or China is a reprehensible one, too. The confidence in the tautological superiority of every aspect of the US to every aspect of every other country is why clearly broken things about the US can remain broken for decades (like health care, etc.)<p>It also exposes a sensitivity (thus a recognition) of the critique. In all forms of analysis that I&#x27;m aware of, the way you examine things that are broken or eccentric is to compare them to things that work correctly or in a straightforward manner through noting the differences. If you do that between the American and Russian media, you will quickly realize that you&#x27;re working with two horribly broken systems, and it&#x27;s about as worthwhile as comparing a kick in the nuts to a punch in the face.",1406908656

This is more of a knee jerk reaction to the cost, and a negotiating tactic.<p>It&#x27;s a tool for purchasing so not sure how it could translate to profit, but interesting idea.<p>The value proposition breaks down differently for different stakeholders.<p>For low level employees that currently email and work on the spreadsheets all the time, it would make their lives a lot easier.  Although it does run the risk of eliminating their job.<p>For mid level managers that typically make the decisions based on all this data, it would make their decisions easier and better informed.  They are likely to be able to save a lot of money.  Perhaps as high as 4 or 5 percent of the budget off a 10-200 million dollar spend.  The possible downside is that it will be less at their discretion who to choose for the vendor.  Cost is not the only consideration, but it will easily quantify the difference in choosing one vendor over another. Currently I think the vendors schmooze the decision maker and that influences their decision.  This tool will make that hard because they don&#x27;t have control over how the &quot;numbers&quot; are presented to the higher ups.<p>For high level managers, they are interested in the savings.  Although this system would make it easier to replace the mid level guy because all the info isn&#x27;t buried in their email and spreadsheets on their desktop.<p>One other issue is that the ultimate decision maker will come from the high level guys because the cost is so high.",1406908582

Walmart&#x27;s mobile apps are highly rated and the services we write to support them are the base of that success.\nWe started from a small company acquisition with a single product. Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.<p>Our team has a unique environment. We&#x27;re still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we pair program when it best suits the task. We use pull requests & code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product and project management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.\nWhat we&#x27;re all about<p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 140 million people every week. It&#x27;s a tough balance but we&#x27;ve found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.<p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:<p><pre><code>  - high performance distributed systems\n  - robust & well-factored codebases\n  - simple & fast deployments\n  - automating the hell out of operations\n  - thorough system test coverage\n  - managing our own development process and work backlog\n  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)\n  - contibuting back to the clojure & open source community\n  - having an engaging team culture and environment\n</code></pre>\nWhat we do:<p><pre><code>  - write all our production systems & tools in Clojure\n  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems\n  - spin up RESTful web services for consuming & ingesting large volumes of data\n</code></pre>\nWe are just a part of:<p><pre><code>  - Walmart is the world&#x27;s largest retailer and one of the world&#x27;s top online \n    retailers.

The product is still young so you&#x27;ll get a chance to have real impact on how the end result looks and feels to our users.\nBesides strong Linux skills, familiarity with Docker will help a lot. Much of our codebase (on cloud and device) is in node.js so JavaScript skill is a plus.<p>The Process<p>-----------<p>Send us your CV (a pointer to source code online is a great plus).

Paying for a majority of the highway system shouldnt be much harder than graduating from kindergarten. Its pretty pathetic that the entire highway system can&#x27;t be funded by the gas tax, given how <i>little</i> it contributes to car oriented infrstructure. 2x gas taxes still wouldn&#x27;t come close to covering the costs of the infrastructure provisioned. Gas taxes in the UK are 8x what we pay, and even that doesnt cover the full cost of their infrastructure. Transit, in comparison, is magnificently cost efficient...only by deceptive means like yours can you appear to make the opposite case.<p>Regardless, the effect of even a tiny subsidy for cars affects the cost recovery of transit. By subsidizing cars, you actually force larger subsidies for transit. The operating and maintenance costs of car use scale linearly with vehicle miles travelled, whereas the costs of transit scale as a step function (you don&#x27;t need a new bus for every user, you need a new bus for every 60 users...riders 2 through 60 ride for free) on the scale of an individual transit vehicle, and roughly log linear in aggregate. Therefore, every transit user you subsidize into a car increases the per user cost of all the rest of the transit users. If car users paid even a tiny fraction more than the pittance they currently do, it could push enough users onto transit to make it sustainable. And if they acctually paid their true costs, almost nobody would drive at all.",1406908218

We’re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.<p>WHO WE ARE. Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nation’s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (<a href=""http://mappiness.org.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mappiness.org.uk</a>). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (<a href=""http://www.getsomeheadspace.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getsomeheadspace.com</a>).<p>WHAT WE USE. We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could imagine using Node, Python, Go and/or R at some point; maybe other things too. Our iOS apps are C and Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate. We’ve tried RubyMotion (impressive, but probably not for us) and we’re playing with Swift. Our Android apps don’t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.<p>WHO YOU MIGHT BE. We’re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid experience in web, Android (especially) and/or iOS app development, who likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important — and usually the hardest — thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog or Github/BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or subjective wellbeing.<p>WHERE WE’RE AT. Geographically we’re currently at Nuffield Health&#x27;s offices in Epsom (free gym and lovely offices), but a move to London (or just possibly Brighton) is likely in the works over the next 6 months. We have just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so you’d be our first developer hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing to your strengths and your preferences. That also means you can expect to help guide our development and share in our success.<p>Contact george(at)PSYT.co.uk",1406907893

Because there is no evidence of massive Russian troop presence, not to my knowledge. This is why you cannot attribute the sheer scale of Ukrainian Government actions to this issue.<p>I will quote the article for your convenience:<p><i>Poroshenko’s “peace plan” and June 21 cease-fire may have seemed such an opportunity, except for their two core conditions: fighters in the southeast first had to “lay down their arms,” and he alone would decide with whom to negotiate peace. The terms seemed more akin to conditions of surrender, and were probably the real reason Poroshenko unilaterally ended the cease-fire on July 1 and intensified Kiev’s assault on eastern cities, initially on the smaller towns of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, which their defenders abandoned—to prevent more civilian casualities, they said—on July 5–6.</i> [1]<p>The fact that there is a genuine insurgency by the Eastern Ukrainians that is not attributable to Russian influence has been supported by multiple experts from different countries. [2]<p>Even the sociologist that gets his money from US State Department says that:<p><i>&quot;And the polls which were done in the first half of [May--and?] it means after massacre in Odessa and after very brutal attack on Mariupol by Ukrainian forces, they were showing that at least even in Donbass there are various--some sort of support for the claims of separatists, and the people in Donbas saw their seizure of governmental buildings as people&#x27;s [incompr.] not as a terrorist act, not as a Russian intervention. But this were the public opinion in Donbass.&quot;</i> [3]<p>>He wouldn&#x27;t be fined or jailed in the U.S. either, due to the First Amendment (although maybe you could make a good case that it&#x27;s &quot;hate speech&quot;). Does that make the U.S. &quot;fascist&quot;?<p>OK, for me it was too emotional to claim this and to talk about this TV show.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/180466/silence-american-hawks-about-kievs-atrocities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thenation.com/article/180466/silence-american-haw...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=958"" rel=""nofollow"">http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=12047"" rel=""nofollow"">http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=...</a>",1406907878

And just to be clear, by profitable I don&#x27;t mean profitable for the investors or owners, but that the business makes more than it costs to run.<p>I&#x27;m asking specifically because entrepreneurship is often vaunted as an excellent career path for smart, ambitious people, but there is a lack of transparency about how many people succeed and how much of that success is due to building a real business vs getting acquired without real profit.",1406907811

There are also two other National Atlas projects in the pipeline, one for Colombia and one for Mexico.<p>The idea is that countries provide us with their data and the Center provides them with economic policy advice and an interactive tool to explore their situation and make sound policy decisions at the regional level.

No late nights and weekends, although I&#x27;ve been known to do that once in a blue moon because I felt like it.<p>We&#x27;re a small engineering team (me and a data viz researcher), but we work with a large group of brilliant doctoral / postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds like econ, public policy, physics, international development.

The hard part is he&#x27;s had to go through indentured servitude (ahem &quot;an apprenticeship&quot;) of several years, the risks of getting injured, and the risks of being furloughed / laid off the moment there is a downturn in work. As I&#x27;ve learned through him, there are actually a lot of different sub-fields in plumbing too - everything from maintenance and installation on industrial dishwashers to major construction projects.<p>He&#x27;s barely 30 but already his body is wearing down from carrying hundreds of pounds of pipe up flights of stairs. He&#x27;s been laid off twice - and guys that have been in the field longer have told him that he&#x27;s had it good.

As a freelance developer though, I&#x27;d agree with your synopsis - once you get outside a few tech geographies and particular companies, the pay scale for tech work drops off quickly, as does the excitement of the work. So then money is less the determining factor than the work itself and/or the lifestyle. Do you like sitting in an office or do you want to be on the road going to job sites and people&#x27;s homes?

Pedagogically, I wonder if Haskell suffers from this emphasis on math.<p>For instance, I couldn&#x27;t figure out State monad for the life of me, and in general how monadic calls could maintain a context &quot;in the background&quot;. Explanations like &quot;it&#x27;s easy just follow the Kleisli arrows&quot; weren&#x27;t helping.<p>Finally I did the exercise of manually &quot;inlining&quot; every >>=, &#x27;get&#x27; and &#x27;modify&#x27; call in a trivial example of a StateT function calling another StateT function. And then I got it. Truckloads of closures/continuations, constant calls to re-create the monad with new information. Function calls with functions as arguments that close over the previous calling function&#x27;s state.<p>A lot of this was specific to how StateT + Identity unwrapped; I&#x27;m sure inlining other monads would reveal different things, and unwrapping IO is impossible in GHC :). My point is, math has been a great source of Haskell&#x27;s incredible expressivity, but the pedagogical focus on math threatens to mask it&#x27;s greatest triumph in Haskell: making all of that boilerplate code go away with incredible precision and elegance. When you rip it open and see what >>= or &#x27;do ... get ... modify&#x27; is doing, you feel the power.<p>I feel like the article suggests this, too:<p><i>The only thing you need category theory for is to take great categorical and mathematical concepts from the world and import them back to programming, and translate them along the way so that others don’t need to make the same journey you did.</i><p>At least for advanced programmers from other worlds, they need to see the guts to appreciate how amazing this stuff is.",1406907368

There is a plugin for Maven that allows the creation of uberjars, but many projects use complicated application servers and the co-location of needed jars -- a system that seems complicated and fragile. I ended up using Buildr as my build system, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to offer an uberjar option, at least nothing as convenient as what is offered by Leinengen. Given the convenience of uberjars, I would think they would be more common Java projects. Apparently they are avoided because so many Java projects are huge (with many thousands of classes) and so a common uberjar pattern (of exploding all dependencies to the same level) runs into the problem of name collisions. Which brings up another issue relevant to Go and Clojure, the small size of many apps, the ease of going with a micro-services architecture, greatly increases the ease of deployment as well.",1406907190

Why requirement? Well, it may be possible to use Haskell in <i>isolation</i> without knowing category theory and higher level math in general, but in the real world, Haskell libraries are in fact based on and assume a foundation in category theory and general understanding of higher level math (see the uber popular Lens library, Yesod, Conduit, or really any non-trivial library implemented in Haskell).<p>Hand wavy stuff like, &quot;oh, you don&#x27;t need to know that, it&#x27;s all just simple building blocks&quot;, mixed with, &quot;go read this paper [filled with unicode symbols that have no meaning whatsoever to someone without a background in higher level math]&quot; creates a split message, on the one hand Haskell is simple; on the other, beyond complex.<p>I&#x27;d say that F#, OCaml, and Scala are all more accessible than Haskell just due to their placing less of a cognitive burden on the beginner. Learning Haskell feels like reverse engineering my mind.<p>Will be interesting to see how things play out, Haskell is moving fast and is clearly ultra popular here on HN, perhaps startups are already using Haskell in anger (i.e. over Rails, Play et al).",1406907065

8120494,comment,8120135,8120135,2,0,rhspeer,,,"I feel the same way, if I had things to do over again I would have gone into a different and likely skilled labor field.<p>TLDR: perception, complex value proposition, dev project are not making enough money, wholesale / retail projects, & dev projects are expensive to sell.<p>Better hours, awesome power tools, significantly less politics & frustration. I like solving problems and I spend most of my time keeping clients from sabotaging their projects and dealing with syntax & communication.<p>A couple points I&#x27;d make:\n1) Skilled labor have significant fixed costs with equipment and buildings, I have about 5k (maybe) total invested in my little home based web dev business (contact me for quality onshore+offshore web development ;).  The fixed costs for skilled labor are easier to understand, for example the phrase &quot;it was cheaper for me to higher it out than buy the tools and probably mess it up the first time&quot;.<p>2) Most software projects are losing money, get on a project where your work is within the direct profit stream and rates are higher, as are expectations.<p>3) One of the many difficult things about tech projects are that it&#x27;s really difficult to understand what is hard and what is easy.  Estimates are rough even after over 10 years of programming, non technical stakeholders have no idea, that goes double for the ones that tell you about all the cool tech stuff they did in the 90&#x27;s.  With plumbing, and almost any other skill, the value proposition is easier to see.<p>4) Dev&#x27;s do not do a good job of appearing to be important.  Like it or not perception is a big deal, I loath working with suits, and do what I can to avoid looking like them because looking professional has become synonymous with high quality hair product and low quality work.  I realize if I look expensive, act like I know what I&#x27;m doing, people assume I know what I&#x27;m doing.  I usually do, but I&#x27;m also usually working at home in a T-shirt, carhartt shorts, and flippy flops, but when clients seem me I dress like Bill Gates & Warren Buffet, not to slick but professional.<p>5) Many dev clients are not retail, they are wholesale.  It&#x27;s important to adjust rates based off volume & project risk.  Joe Shmoe from craigslist is going to offer a low volume project, with the high risk that he&#x27;s going to mess up his project and blame you because he has no idea what he&#x27;s doing, those guys get higher rates.   Agencies that have a good plan, reasonable volume, and a history of success have earned a lower rate.<p>6) Dev projects are expensive to sell compared to skilled labor projects, this means sales guys deserve a bigger cut, and since they are good at negotiating they leverage this to get as much as they can. This leaves a smaller piece of the pie for the rest of the team.",1406906850

N.B. I&#x27;m not saying one can&#x27;t feel accomplished with a plumbing career, but it is far less common to find one such person than it is to find someone who finds a IT career fulfilling.<p>You could also say the IT market is just better/more efficient and that there is way more liquidity on IT work than plumber work. If you have a stock and someone is attempting a aggressive takeover (that is, one agent in the market intensely needs what you have), you can ask more than market price and still sell. In plumbing, the client often faces similar situations. Other factor is that there almost always is a time pressure and the client does not have perfect information, calling every plumber in town to gauge prices has a cost in time.<p>Concluding, I still wouldn&#x27;t go for plumbing. I (personally) wouldn&#x27;t be fulfilled with such a career.

Victims of rape, violence, neglect, abuse, poverty, other types of trauma, people with serious mental disorders, or anyone who wasn&#x27;t lucky enough to survive their first suicide attempts (i&#x27;ve survived at least 4 myself), don&#x27;t get any more chances and deserve to suffer, because God is always just and fair.<p>To many of us that have decided to reject religion, such a seemingly at-odds message (God is just and fair, but life is unfair, and some people just don&#x27;t get second chances) is despicable and insane. It&#x27;s people trying to assuage their own fear of the unknown, and guilt for their wrongdoings, by subscribing to a cosmology that of course they will be forgiven for their crimes and attain everlasting happiness and utopia, but everyone else is damned. A number of religions, and sects within religions, maintain exclusivity for their beliefs about who gets into heaven and who doesn&#x27;t, yet adherents always believe there can be no doubt that they themselves are correct and everybody else is wrong.<p>I choose to believe that if God exists, He/She/They are at least as just and fair, compassionate and loving and forgiving, as the best human has ever been. If we devote ourselves to good deeds and works, not judging and condemning our fellow man, nor resting on our laurels and often arbitrary convictions, then we are more likely to find favor from any judge weighing the value of our lives and deeds, and the trajectory of our hearts.",1406906647

Telling someone that something is hard before you teach it to them is a self-fulfilling prophesy.<p>My wife is a native Russian speaker, and she is <i>slowly</i> teaching me Russian. I struggle when learning new languages, so it&#x27;s easy for me to get discouraged when the progress seems too slow.<p>My wife often teaches me a few words at a time, and without fail, when she says, &quot;This word is hard,&quot; before teaching it to me, it takes me the longest to learn those words.[0] It&#x27;s like my brain, upon hearing that something is going to be hard, assumes that I&#x27;ll forget it anyway, and simply turns off.[1]<p>If you are getting ready to teach a difficult topic, perhaps spend a little more time beforehand trying to find good analogies and approaches. Oftentimes, a topic&#x27;s difficulty melts away when a student can make an appropriate connection.<p>Don&#x27;t confuse the difficulty of teaching a topic with the difficulty of learning it.<p>[0] You might argue, &quot;Those words probably <i>are</i> harder.&quot; That&#x27;s a fair point, but in the hours before our wedding, I managed to learn how to say, &quot;Я знаю что я никогда не буду голодным. [I know that I will never be hungry.]&quot; On the other hand, it took me days to learn, &quot;карандаш [pencil]&quot; after she told me it was a hard word.<p>[1] When I recognized this phenomenon I asked her to please stop telling when she expects something to be hard.",1406906111

8120343,comment,8120079,8120079,2,0,afiedler,,,"SEEKING FREELANCER - Remote<p>This project is to create a Windows desktop application (compatible with Windows 7) that will connect to IQFeed (<a href=""http://www.iqfeed.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iqfeed.net/</a>) and request streaming stock ticks for about 5000 stocks. When the program starts up, the user will upload a CSV file of the tickers that he wants to stream from IQFeed. The program will then request a streaming feed for those tickers. It will keep a hash table in memory that contains the symbol as the key and the last trade price as the value. The application will also act as a server and accept network connections from other clients to access the last trade prices. The other clients will send a simple message over TCP/IP requesting the last price for a stock, and the hub should respond with the last price in the hash table.<p>Performance is very important for this program. You&#x27;ll need a good understanding of writing multithreaded programs in .NET, as well as writing low-level TCP/IP .NET networking code using either async or a separate thread for each client (there will only be a half-dozen clients at most). I do have example code of another program (in C#) that I can provide to you that does something similar for a different data feed service. We can also investigate using a WebSockets library for the hub-client communication, but System.Net.Websockets is unfortunately unsupported on Windows 7.<p>Experience with IQFeed or another similar stock market data feed is definite plus.

Clean work (water lines and such) is easy enough and easy to check, especially with the new generation of water lines.

It&#x27;s also very hard work, crawlspaces are not named aptly, you can&#x27;t really crawl there. And after a day in a crawlsuit you&#x27;ll just love sitting behind your desk. There is no such thing as easier money than IT money. Figure a decade or so as a plumber will teach you more about appreciating the ability to do IT work than anything else will ever do. Maybe a few months of doing it every day will suffice.<p>Also, get professional liability insurance and don&#x27;t touch any gas lines until you (a) know what you&#x27;re doing and (b) have the required papers (if that&#x27;s applicable where you live).<p>That&#x27;s not stuff to mess around with if you are not 100% sure how to do it right.

You need two things: one is an energy source to power the electromagnets, like some kind of nuclear reactor, and the other is a big pile of rocks.<p>The big problem for a rocket is that it&#x27;s not just carrying the payload and reactor fuel, it&#x27;s also carrying that big pile of rocks. For a given exhaust velocity, the faster you want to go, the bigger that rock pile has to be, which is even harder to push, and the challenge just multiplies. If you&#x27;re trying to get to another star it&#x27;s practically impossible.<p>A reactionless drive would still have the nuclear reactor, but it gets rid of the big pile of rocks. Now higher speed no longer means you need a bigger rock pile, it just means you run the nuclear reactor longer. You&#x27;ll need more reactor fuel but with the mass driver you needed that <i>plus</i> the bigger rock pile. Now you just need more reactor fuel, and that&#x27;s relatively minor.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;d be a huge technological breakthrough, if it actually works.",1406905573

Then I check them off at the end of a period (day, week, etc.), grade myself, and make notes about what worked, what didn&#x27;t and what I learned. Save these in a binder so you can see your progress, or lack thereof.<p>2) Use Pomodoro or HoursTracker or some other app that works for you. Observing how many (few) hours I was productively working was eye-opening.<p>3) Reward yourself. The idea is, work shouldn&#x27;t stretch on &quot;indefinitely&quot; - then you have little psychological incentive to complete.<p>4) Separate your workspace from your living space, even if it is only a desk that you use solely for work.<p>5) Use StickK or some other form of commitment contract.<p>6) Use SelfControl or other internet-limiting app. Watch out for blocking Google URLs though - block youtube, and you can end up blocking Google Drive.<p>7) In the beginning, overinvest in setting up systems and tracking to discover what really works for you.

I prefer to describe it the other way round: the program is an abstract symbol manipulator, which can be turned into a concrete one by supplying a computer to it.

But I think I can contribute something.<p>Having read what I could over the years on the academic side of &quot;women in tech&quot; (i.e., academic research studying the matter, rather than opinion pieces), the consensus seems to be that the early teens are the time where the decision is taken to move away (or not) from STEM fields. That is part of why the Girls Who Code initiative & others like it is such a big deal.<p>There are a lot of different factors and stereotypes playing into the decision to exit STEM tracks, but among them are - &quot;unpleasant male geeks&quot;, &quot;programmers work alone&quot;, &quot;girls don&#x27;t need to know math&quot;, &quot;boys figure things out&quot; and so forth. (<i>Clearly</i> these are a subset of examples, and also clearly not all of these are 100% influential for any particular person, place, time). So the stereotypical 13 y/o girl and her interest in STEM is actually the target of a lot of research and policy efforts.<p>There&#x27;s also a self-reinforcing aspect to this: heavily gender-coded places aren&#x27;t typically presenting a welcome to people of the other gender. I read a academic paper on this in the last several years, but can&#x27;t recall the experiment in detail or the citation. The implication is that a workspace festooned with seriously masculine widgets often tells many women that, &quot;hey, man cave here. not so welcome&quot;.<p>For the interested person, the academic experiments are usually well done and their results, while not always surprising, clearly quantify certain sexist aspects in the tech world.",1388346428

Their meat do not contain enough omega-3, a simple fact. Farmed fish&#x27;s omega 3 content varies depending on their diet.<p>2. Many people have the misconception that the skin can synthesize vitamin d3 from any kind of sunlight. Not true.\nGlass blocks most of UVB and only let through UVA. So sitting in a windowed office won&#x27;t work. \nSome of us live in cold places and wear clothes that cover most of our skin on the rare occasion that we do go out.\nThe skin needs UVB photon to transform 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 in a 2-step process. \nIt gets even more complicated when you take into account the level of melanin in your skin. Not only that, only certain spectrum of UVB carries sufficient energy to photolyzed 7-dehydrocholesterol. So that means your skin has to be exposed to sunlight at certain time of the day.<p>The thing to understand about these deficiency is they occur very slowly. The process is very insidious because the brain and body is great at adapting. It comes to accept the abnormal as normal. Depressed people come to accept their condition as normal and unchangeable. Most of them don&#x27;t even realized they&#x27;re depressed. They can&#x27;t imagine a different reality or mental state.

Caffeine, definitely, but the crash is nowhere near the level of Rx stimulants. Caffeine crash is much more mild and tolerable.

There are two models for scheduling tasks. 1:1 means that each task runs in it&#x27;s own operating system thread, and the OS is responsible for scheduling. M:N means that M tasks run on N threads Typically, N is roughly one per core, and M is greater than N. The runtime is responsible for assigning tasks to threads and scheduling multiple tasks on a thread. &quot;Green threads&quot; is a term from the Java world, and it means M:N, often with N=1, regardless of how many cores are available.<p>The motivation for M:N is that OS threads tend to be fairly heavy in terms of memory usage, scheduling overhead etc. For a language that intended to enable highly concurrent programs, it&#x27;s theoretically more efficient to use one OS thread per CPU to get maximum parallelism and layer the units of concurrency (tasks in this case), on top of that.<p>The thing is, doing M:N well enough to actually achieve the theoretical gains is difficult, and there are many cases of projects that started with M:N and eventually ditched it and moved to 1:1.<p>(Edit for clarity on green threads.)",1388346400

To that haphazard scheme, strongly imply that those practitioners are not merely expert at assessing the abilities of others (something that does <i>not</i> follow from the mere observation that the practitioners themselves are competent in the field), but also <i>psychologists</i> capable of extracting from a 45 minute adversarial interview the &quot;culture&quot; and mentality of candidates who are so nervous and upset from being judged by hostile strangers in this crapshoot process.<p>Software hiring is widely regarded by hiring managers as a nearly random process; at best, at savvy companies, the house might have an edge over time.

[...]<p>OK, nothing bad here, assuming that the implication is that there aren&#x27;t many female founders for him to discriminate against.<p>> The problem with that is I think, at least with technology companies, the people who are really good technology founders have a genuine deep interest in technology. In fact, I&#x27;ve heard startups say that they did not like to hire people who had only started programming when they became CS majors in college.<p>No argument here.<p>> If someone was going to be really good at programming they would have found it on their own. Then if you go look at the bios of successful founders this is invariably the case, they were all hacking on computers at age 13.<p>OK, so this is the statement that reeks of privilege. And I agree, except if you don&#x27;t consider what immediately follows:<p>> What that means is the problem is 10 years upstream of us. If we really wanted to fix this problem, what we would have to do is not encourage women to start startups now. It&#x27;s already too late. What we should be doing is somehow changing the middle school computer science curriculum or something like that. God knows what you would do to get 13 year old girls interested in computers. I would have to stop and think about that.<p>So my interpretation of this was that PG implicitly acknowledges that boys have a privilege here, a privilege to explore computing at the formative age necessary to become a great hacker. For whatever reason, girls do not have that privilege in today&#x27;s current society, and so PG proposes, as an example measure, to overhaul middle school curriculum.<p>OK, so PG didn&#x27;t have any great revolutionary ideas on how to fix the problem of privilege, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that was his expectation for the interview. What he said wasn&#x27;t full of hope and sunshine too: for women who are at the entrepreneurial age right now, they&#x27;ve missed the optimal time to become a Steve Wozniak or Mark Zuckerberg. OK, that should raise objections of ageism, but it&#x27;s not sexism, it&#x27;s a statement of the shitty situation that girls have when it comes to exploring tech at a young age.<p>And what PG says is of course biased towards the importance of technical prowess, and frankly, I agree. Would Steve Jobs be anywhere if Woz wasn&#x27;t the batshit-amazing young engineer that he was? Not at all. And so when PG says the problem of few female founders <i>cannot be solved</i> by just encouraging women to create startups -- without the necessary tech acumen...I think what he argues is reasonable from a technical standpoint. In terms of tech startups, it&#x27;s not just ideas, but technical execution, and Apple is the very best example of that.<p>So I think PG is right to point out that &quot;encourage more female-led startups&quot; is more of a feel-good band-aid than a solution. We want more female-led startups and <i>we want them to succeed</i>. In PG&#x27;s opinion, that kind of success -- which is a <i>major longshot for men</i> -- can only come from expanding the early opportunities for girls to get more interested in tech and science.",1388345635

They&#x27;re in the business of risk management. Once you understand that distinction, much of what they do makes sense.<p>Unfortunately, some unhappy conclusions for the customers of these services do logically follow, starting with the fact that if you&#x27;re not a huge customer, the financial services have little natural incentive to care about the safety of any assets/investments they handle for you. If something very bad happens, you might be an acceptable loss relative to the cost of mitigation, right up to the point of fighting you in court and then losing anyway. You personally might suffer greatly for any losses, and even if it&#x27;s ultimately put right you might suffer months or years being dragged through the system, but no employee at any financial service is personally going to lose any sleep over your case.<p>This is why it is necessary to have regulators with teeth in financial industries. Any lapse that could cause significant harm to a customer should also potentially cause significant harm to the financial service. An ongoing pattern of such lapses should cause severe damage to the service&#x27;s bottom line and eventually it should become an existential threat to the financial service itself, preferably with safeguards to ensure that the management and/or shareholders can&#x27;t just escape using the technicalities of incorporation. Without this sort of counter-balance, the numbers will always be in favour of trampling on the little guy, and if there&#x27;s one industry that runs on the numbers more than anything else, it&#x27;s financial services.",1388345174

I don&#x27;t believe this is the case, especially when you consider that your stated reason for the short-fall in women is that they are not exposed to programming as a child, implying the reason that men do not get into nursing is because they were exposed to less nursing like activities as a child.

You log into the bank system. You visit other websites which have a tracking system. The bank gets a profile of the types of websites you visit, to better profile the types of customers it has. The tracking service has a profile of the types of users that it sees, to better place advertisements for their other customers.<p>Thirdly, a fingerprint of this kind is more of a multi-dimensional nature, than just a hash of the results. It allows for some variation, it will also update itself based on other information. For example &quot;oh it looks like they have added a new font, but the other information is the same, and their behaviour across all the sites we track them is the same&quot;...",1388344497

Although this seems high, this was over the entire life of the experiment, with some users returning after weeks or months.<p>Importantly, we can assume that the fingerprint will change incrementally, and remain mostly constant (eg., upgrade plugin OR install new fonts, but probably not everything at once). Therefore, closely-spaced repeat visits could be algorithmically matched, even if the fingerprint changes. This could be especially effective when including other &quot;unstable&quot; (short term) information, such as IP or geolocation, something the authors did not attempt (because these are generally unstable).<p>From the paper (page 13):<p>&quot;We ran our algorithm over the set of users whose cookies indicated that they\nwere returning to the site 1-2 hours or more after their first visit, and who now\nhad a divergent fingerprint. Excluding users whose fingerprints changed because\nthey disabled javascript (a common case in response to visiting panopticlick.\neff.org, but perhaps not so common in the real world), our heuristic made a\ncorrect guess in 65% of cases, an incorrect guess in 0.56% of cases, and no guess\nin 35% of cases. 99.1% of guesses were correct, while the false positive rate was\n0.86%.

6980746,comment,6980431,6980431,71,0,lkrubner,,,"One fascinating aspect of this is how bad the post 1990 startup culture has been for women. There was something about those big, boring corporations of the 1970s and 1980s that actually gave female hackers more acceptance than what startups have offered.<p>You can see female interest in programming change in the charts on these pages:<p><a href""http://blogs.computerworld.com/it-careers/21993/women-computer-science-visual-trendlin"" rel""nofollo"">http://blogs.computerworld.com/it-careers/21993/women-comput...</a><p>Note that those graphs show raw numbers, not a percentage of the population -- if you adjust for the growing population, female graduation rates in computer science peak in the 1980s. As it says in the text:<p>&quot;As a share of all CS bachelor&#x27;s degrees granted that year, females had slipped almost 10 points, from 37% in 1984/1985 to 27% in 2003.&quot;<p>A family anecdote: my mom was working on her Phd in urban planning back in the 1970s and her advisor said to her &quot;You know, in the future, many of these issues of traffic and resource allocation will be resolved through computer simulations, so you should learn to program.&quot; My mom thought that was a good idea so she took some classes and learned basic programming. She does not recall feeling like an outsider in those classes: the computer field was still new and felt wide open.<p>Nowadays a lot of startups talk about the need for &quot;culture fit&quot;. This tends to limit the diversity of the gender and race and class of who is hired. For contrast, consider people like Evelyn Boyd Granville, and her acceptance at IBM.<p><a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Boyd_Granvill"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Boyd_Granville</a><p>Here on Hacker News we also discussed the story that Raganwald posted, about another black woman at IBM, though that article is now offline:<p><a href""http://raganwald.posterous.com/a-womans-stor"" rel""nofollo"">http://raganwald.posterous.com/a-womans-story</a><p>If IBM applied a filter of &quot;culture fit&quot; then these women would not have been hired. But IBM, and many of the big corporations in the USA, followed very liberal policies that promoted diversity in the work place.<p>There were some startups from the 1950s and 1960s that broke new ground in terms of diversity. Ray Kroc built up a small startup called McDonalds and in a quiet way he made feminist history in his treatment of June Martino. She was initially hired as the bookkeeper, but she was later entrusted with vast responsibilities and finally, in 1965, when McDonalds went public, she was given shares in the company, exactly like any other cofounder of a startup. This was apparently the first time in history that a woman was treated as a real cofounder and given stock.<p><a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Martin"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Martino</a><p>If you look at the numbers, it seems clear that the emergence of the tech-based startup scene, in the 1990s, changed things for women. The startups have not emphasized hiring diversity. The startups tend to emphasize culture fit, and they were doing so even before that phrase came into existence. Why this should be, I am not sure. There have been startups in the past that have emphasized diversity in hiring, so I am not clear why the current generation of startups cannot do so. But what is clear is that it is not a priority for them. The big and boring corporations of the past did a better job of creating spaces for women in tech.<p>Edit to add: to avoid being overly innocent, we should note how much the talk of &quot;culture&quot; is sometimes a smokescreen to hide power dynamics. Shanley Kane said &quot;In Silicon Valley, and the tech industry in general, a lot of people were giving these talks about what their culture was and it was really superficial and focused on the privileged aspects of the company like free food and massages.&quot; Here on Hacker News we have already discussed the post &quot;Google&#x27;s &#x27;free food&#x27; is not free&quot; but it is worth remembering how much the talk about &quot;culture&quot; is just a negotiating tactic.<p><a href""http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2012/01/21/notfree"" rel""nofollo"">http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2012/01/21/notfree/</a>",1388343733

However, I think science is coming more and more to show that creativity is far from an inspired activity. It&#x27;s mostly the result of a lot of hard work and problem solving. Both of which require a person to show up and work.<p>Reading a book like Mason Currey&#x27;s &quot;Daily Rituals: How Artists Work&quot; is very enlightening because it illustrates just how shockingly routine and boring the lives of many famous artists really are/were.",1388343719

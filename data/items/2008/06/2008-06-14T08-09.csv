217452,comment,217411,217411,0,0,jhollingworth,,,"I am a big fan of both RoR & ASP.NET (Although I only get paid to do ASP.NET :( ) and i've found are both awsome at doing very different things.<p>If you want a basic data driven application which isn't going to have a significant load, then I would go with RoR. I have personally found that when ever you go beyond that use case, you will very quickly find the limitations of the framework (e.g. you can't start a sepeartate thread in an action). Yes there are workarounds to these problems, but they are all rather experiemental and a bit hacky.<p>For all the thats bad about microsoft, the fact that they are making ASP.NET for profit means they are designing it for large companies which have very complex problems to solve. This means that ASP.NET is designed to be highly scalable and efficent.<p>What I would say is avoid WebForms at all costs, it is a horrible framework designed for desktop app dev's (using WinForms) to quickly get to grips with web development. Unfortunatly to get WebForms to act like a WinForms app requires a lot of horrible things (i'm pretty sure that satan invented ViewState). Also, as xenoterracide mentioned it will run best on Windows Server meaning you will probably have to go down the microsoft route and spend crap loads of money.<p>A better option would be to look at Castle Project (<a href=""http://www.castleproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.castleproject.org/</a>) they have basically developed a port of Rails for C#. It has all the core concepts of Rails, works brilliantly on MonoRail and uses NHibernate at the core of it's ORM and so can you use whatever DB you like.<p>I think in the end, you shouldn't be looking at the language and saying this ones got more hype I should use that one. I would say look at the actual problem you are trying to solve, what are the requirements? Do you need something out in a couple of days which just does adds a few records to the DB? go with RoR. Are you making a massive data mining app which is gonna be run by 50k people? Go with ASP.NET (or MonoRail)!",1213433264
217451,comment,217411,217411,0,0,elad,,,"I find that Microsoft tools in general offer a compelling package when you start out - great IDE, good docs and purportedly good support (I never use customer support myself, so can't comment on that from a personal experience). The problems begin when you want to move a step further - explore the code or hack stuff.<p>Also, you're stuck with their platform for everything. The advantage in using an open package is that you can mix and match. If you're willing to do some research and work, you can find the tools that best match your specific requirements and hack together your dream application.<p>In the end it really depends on your temperament as a developer. If you prefer easy gains initially and can live with the limitations down the road, plus you don't really care how it all works under the hood and rather just have something that works OK in the end, then I guess MS should be your choice.<p>The reason that you find mainly ""microsoft sucks"" answers in hacker forums, is that hackers love the freedoms that being locked in to the MS platform takes away.",1213433061

217444,comment,216960,217035,0,0,greyman,,,">>> building traffic to some website for adsense and affiliate sales for the same?<p>There are basically two main paths you might take here. I have a friend who made a fortune by spamming search engines, but his peak was about 6 years ago, when it was quite easy to game google for profit. Now he has about 1.000 (one thousand) interlinked domains with affiliate links. Of course, as Google algo improved, his sites are slowly de-ranked, but there is also MSN search and Yahoo, and his ""imperium"" is so big, that he already earned enough to live confortably for the rest of his life.<p>But anyway, he says that starting <i>now</i> this would be much harder, because Google already closed many gaps. It is doable, but much harder.<p>Another way is to use ""white hat"" way, i.e. building normal content like cool gadget blog. But this is also harder that it looks, especially to build ""great team of 4 paid writers"". Author don't elaborate more about that, but this I think is non-trivial. There need to be some unique vision plus writers who can execute it by writing engaging content.",1213431220

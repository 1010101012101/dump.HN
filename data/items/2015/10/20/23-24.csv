(Edit: They were somewhat coerced by Italy, where they produce it[2].  I think EU export law forbids it now too.  Still, they could probably produce it in the US at a worthwhile premium if they wanted to, but it appears they don&#x27;t.)<p>> Other death penalty states have turned to different drugs, but Nebraska had few options because the state’s protocol calls for sodium thiopental.<p>I don&#x27;t know how that came about, but it makes me wonder if this would be an effective way to weaken a law you don&#x27;t like: compromise on a legal implementation that depends on something that won&#x27;t last forever.  I guess it&#x27;s not unique, though; it&#x27;s like how the debt ceiling is only bumped up a bit, or PATRIOT Act provisions extended a couple of years at a time.<p>> Changing it to a more modern execution drug would have required public meetings, and that would take time that Ricketts and his DOC did not have.<p>It sounds like Gov. Ricketts&#x27; ego and legacy rest on maintaining the death penalty in his state.  The Atlantic[0] covered how the state legislature abolished it, and the multiple ways the government sought to twist law to do it anyway.  The governor and his father personally financed $300k on a petition drive to suspend the new law[1].  Must be nice to have so much money and nothing better to do than try to obtain the right to legally kill strangers.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/a-governor-threatens-to-execute-prisoners-out-of-spite/394949/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/a-govern...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/10/19/nebraska_death_penalty_petition_suspends_new_law_triggers_november_2016.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/10/19/nebraska_d...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=175550&p=irol-newsArticle_print&ID=1518610"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=175550&p=irol-ne...</a>",1445383705

Surely, given the nature of atmosphere and radiation, the dosage at twice the normal altitude is considerably more than twice what it is at 30k feet. I wonder what that did to my chances of getting a radiation induced cancer now ;)<p>As an aside, that happened well before 9/11, so I was actually able (/invited by the flight attendants) to go to the cockpit and talk to the pilots while were cruising along at mach 2. I remember asking the pilot what the actual takeoff speed was (he said about 175 mph, if I recall correctly. Given the glued-to-the-seat acceleration we experienced on take off, sounds about right), and all sorts of other nerdy questions about the technology.<p>I&#x27;m gonna pour one out for the pre 9/11 days when curious kids could visit the cockpit of an airplane and be a nerd with the pilots.<p>I&#x27;ll pour another one out for the Concorde.<p>I still remember it pretty vividly (though memories can of course be deceiving ;), but we made it from heathrow to jfk in 3.5 hours.

The background context has the kid messing about with plenty of other electronic devices for fun, but it also has a politically-active father turning up at well-publicised Quran-burning events and claiming shock that the Quran was burned. It&#x27;s not exactly beyond the realms of possibility that he might have seen the potential for his son&#x27;s electronic experimentation to end in a suspension and similar barrage of publicity, even if the son himself is merely an innocuous hacker type with a fondness for electronics.<p>Obviously any suggestion of intent still doesn&#x27;t excuse the way the police reportedly handled things, or make Dawkins&#x27; attitude any less ridiculous.",1445382009

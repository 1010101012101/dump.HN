Open youtube in one tab to listen to a long lecture, open more tabs.. slim webpages still load fast, but ""regular"" (derpy!) ones take ages.<p>And then it's also a resource. I turn water off when I don't need it, because wasting water sucks, not because I cannot afford wasting some. Why should bandwidth be much different? I'm all for using what you need, or for making experiments, but the quest for shinyness over content, putting <i>all</i> sidebars on <i>all</i> pages, including jquery plugins and whatnot at the drop of a hat etc.. all that leads to crappy sites and a crappy infrastructure. That is, the same infrastructure could allow people to achieve much more, if more sites were spartanic like, say, HN ^^<p>Because at the end of the day, I don't even care if I notice it. That argumentation is lazy and shortsighted. See, if the site loads in 200 ms instead of 250 ms, and I load the site a thousand times per year, that's 50 seconds per year -- over 10 years that's over 8 minutes. That may not sound like much, but consider that this is not the only site, and that I am not the only human (and that load time reductions of much more than 50 ms would be possible on a lot of big sites). In total, the amount of time wasted by petty BS is probably quite staggering.",1356332389

4962114,comment,4959493,4961870,4,0,btilly,,,"Bill 101 was clearly intended to make Quebec unpleasant for anglophones, and the fact that within several years something like 1/3 of all anglophones living in Quebec had left Quebec is strong evidence that it succeeded in that goal.  These were not people who particularly wanted to leave.  These were people who lived in Quebec, had jobs, had houses.  Yet they abandoned those, and the ones that I knew were very clear that it was entirely because of Bill 101.  You can believe what you like about the bill - the level of ""voluntary self-deportation"" demonstrates a racist effect.  And without it there would have been demographically no possibility of a close separation vote in the mid-90s.<p>To give a random story, I had a friend in high school whose mother was hired as an English teacher at a private school to replace the one who had left the year earlier due to bill 101.  The family had just emigrated from Australia for this job.  They were shocked upon arriving to find out that their son was not allowed to be a student in the school that his mother taught at, even though they were willing to pay, but would have to take French instruction due to his parents not being able to demonstrate that they had been instructed in English in Quebec.  Of course, having grown up in Australia, he did not know any French.  As soon as the family figured out a way to afford leaving Quebec, they moved to British Columbia.<p>On my scholarship, I was living on an NSERC out of country to the USA.  In 1991 a Canadian dollar was worth 0.87281 US.  As secession stirred in Quebec, the Canadian currency dropped like a rock, reaching 0.72863 in 1995.  As a starving grad student, you can be certain that I counted every dollar and noticed every drop.  And every time the news stories were full of Quebec separatism being the cause of the continuing decline.  (As soon as the vote failed, the currency stabilized then began to creep up.  But not fast enough to for me to benefit.)<p>About the natives, the tribes involved were the Cree and the Innuit.  Google immediately turned up <a href=""http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/oct/22/tribes-want-no-part-of-quebec-separatism-cree/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/oct/22/tribes-want-no-...</a> which verifies that the vote happened, but does not give results.  (However it does state the results to be a foregone conclusion.)  As for the treaty, you misunderstand.  I am not talking about a treaty.  I am referring to the terms of the Quebec Boundaries Extensions Acts of 1898 and 1912 where large amounts of land obtained from Hudson's Bay in 1871 became part of Quebec.  The grant of land was far from unconditional, and constitutes about 2/3 of the present borders of Quebec.<p>The specific term that I am thinking of is: <i>(e) That the trusteeship of the Indians in the said territory, and the\nmanagement of any lands now or hereafter reserved for their use, shall\nremain in the Government of Canada subject to the control of Parliament.</i>  Which indicates to me that if Quebec were to leave Canada, it would not have a strong claim to the land that the Cree and Inuit lived on.  (Particularly since the people living there virtually unanimously did not want to be part of an independent Quebec.)  Of course that land is about half the province, and is the location of hydroelectric power plants that are very important for the province's finances.",1356331989

4962111,comment,4960831,4960831,2,0,b1daly,,,"From reading in the popular press about Jaron Lanier he strikes me as more of an artiste than technologist. Which is fine by me.<p>His comments in this article hint at something that nags at me as a musician and lover of music, which is the rise of the concept of ""content"" to describe creative works.<p>The ubiquity of digital networks has led to an unprecedented level of commodification of music (for example). Various large entities like (Google, Apple, Facebook) and influential networks of transmission (bit torrent, Grooveshark, Spotify, Mega-Upload) seem to have not only captured more of the value of creative artists, they have also captured huge cultural mindshare. (The tech CEO as rock star).<p>Google in particular disturbs me as it seems like the search engine has become more important than what is searched for. This somehow feels hollow to me.<p>I'm interested in general about how meaning is created by and for people. Music is an old means of adding, or at least enhancing meaning.<p>Now figures like Steve Jobs take some of that role. But there is at least some irony that the gadget that broke Apple into the popular mainstream was a music player, completely un-interesting with out the content that it commodifies.",1356331917

You have to change the type signature if you want to do IO<p>The author seems to be conflating IO and side effects. IO is just one of the many ways that side effects can occur.<p>> Purity also means you can't read or write global variables, that's just another type of IO.<p>Er... what? No, not at all.<p>Reading global variables is not side effects, much less IO.<p>Writing global variables is side effects, but has nothing to do with IO.<p>>  Functions that do IO are difficult or impossible to test.<p>Absolutely not, IO functions are not harder to test than regular ones. Is your function creating a file? Start your test, assert the file doesn't exist, call your function, assert your file exists. Done.<p>> I now put all my IO in top-level functions that are called directly from main<p>This is great for homework, but in the real life, IO needs to be performed throughout your entire application, and unsafePerformIO is just not an option. You have to use iteratees for this kind of operation, which adds a pretty thick layer of complexity to your code base.<p>> boo :: Map Integer String -> String -> Integer<p>This syntax is clean but it doesn't tell me anything that<p>def boo(map: Map[Integer, String], key: String) : Integer<p>doesn't tell me.<p>> The point is, you can't confidently reason about a function from its signature if IO is involved.<p>Sure, you can: the mention of IO tells me this function operates within the IO monad, so I know <i>a lot</i> of operations and laws that apply to it.<p>Haskell is a fantastic language but this article is doing a very poor job at explaining why. I suspect its author has only recently started using Haskell and would have been better advised to wait a bit before sharing his enthusiasm.",1356331863

4962090,comment,4962046,4962046,4,0,SecretofMana,,,"You did a great job summarizing those topics concisely, but I have some quibbles about the P and NP stuff:<p>1. NP isn't the set of problems that can't be solved in a polynomial amount of time, but rather the set of problems that can be solved non-deterministically in polynomial time. This distinction is important, since this means by definition that P is a subset of NP, and furthermore means that uncomputable problems such as the Halting Problem do not belong in NP.<p>2. Your definitions for NP-completeness seem mixed up -- the polytime reduction property you're mentioning is the definition of an NP-hard problem, and you've said it backwards. If a problem is NP-hard, every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time (i.e. it is just as ""hard"" as every problem in NP). NP-completeness requires in addition to this the property that the problem itself is in NP. For example, although the Halting Problem is NP-hard, it is not NP-complete, since it is not in NP. NP-hardness of a problem can be shown by polytime reducing any NP-complete problem to it, since any problem in NP can be polytime reduced to the NP-complete problem.",1356331260

You bring up the exact point that the banks bring up to justify this, and I hope I can make you think about it in a different way.<p>I would argue that people don't really have a choice about whether to overdraft.<p>Have you ever accidentally tripped while walking? I have. In fact, I probably do it a few times a year. Do I choose to trip? No. I choose to walk, and sometimes tripping happens.<p>Now imagine if every time I accidentally tripped, someone charged me $30. That would be pretty absurd, right?<p>Well that's exactly what happens with overdraft charges. People who are just trying to walk--trying to hold a job and pay their bills--occasionally trip and the bank takes $30 from their account with no discussion. These people aren't choosing to trip, they are just trying to walk. The part that motivates me to speak out about this, is that the only people getting charged $30 for tripping, are those who can least afford it, or speak up for themselves.<p>If the banks suffered when someone tripped, then the question would be more open. But it doesn't cost a bank anything to simply decline overdraft charges without charging a fee. Maybe it did a while ago. It doesn't anymore, not when balances are checked digitally.",1356329918

However, I can create a single folder on my laptop that organizes all of this music, even though it's far too large to fit on the laptop's hard drive. Even though the files exist on multiple hard drives, my laptop knows which ones have which files, so I know which hard drive I'd need to plug in to access a particular file.<p>Better yet, since this is a fully distributed setup, there's nothing magical about my laptop - I have a desktop that has another copy of the repository, and it too knows where all of the files are (even though it has a different subset of my music collection).<p>I can also back portions of the collection up without ever having my entire collection on a single drive. I can enforce redundancy - ""make sure that three <i>verifiable</i> copies of this file exist on other drives before deleting it here"". I can back up to Amazon S3 or Glacier.

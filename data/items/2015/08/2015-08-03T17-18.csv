If we assume 100 1-hour rides are needed in a day, and each person uses their own vehicle, we need 100 cars, despite the fact that we need 100 car-hours. If we can optimize with a service like Uber, we would only need 5 cars to provide 100 car-hours in a day.<p>Obviously, trips are not completely fungible, but I think the central concept is clear above.<p>The second piece is that those 5 cars will be replaced much sooner than the 100 individual cars. That&#x27;s where the utilization comes in. If everyone drives themselves, then the stock of cars must equal peak demand. If services like Uber combine riders (via UberPool - the typical car has more than 1 passenger seat that is unutilized in the typical commute) and provide utilization for cars at 50% of the day, then the total stock of vehicles would be lower than required for self-driving.<p>These two effects combine leading to fewer cars.",1438624697

9998287,comment,9994246,9997696,0,0,epidemian,,,"> To me that appears to be the strangest way to express a loop in any language I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot of them).<p>Well, given that repeating some piece of code N times involves only two &quot;entities&quot;, the code to be repeated and the number of repetitions, i see it as a very natural OO design decision to put that looping logic on a method on one of those two entities. The other possibility would be to make the &quot;code&quot; object respond to a method that tells it how many times to execute:<p><pre><code>  { puts &quot;Hello, alternate Ruby&quot; }.do_times(10)
</code></pre>
It might be more intuitive to do so if the first object you have is the code you want to repeat, but it doesn&#x27;t read as nicely :P<p>> It also really bothers me that in ruby you can invoke a function on a null value to see if its null (myvar.nil?). That&#x27;s really messed up...<p>Can you elaborate in this please? I personally think that making nil something else than an object on OO language wouldn&#x27;t make much sense. It would be an unnecessary complexity to stipulate &quot;the way we interact with objects is through message-passing, except with nil, on which you cannot pass any message, but instead you have to compare it by identity to a global value named nil&quot;. Nil being a regular object that responds to things like .to_s or .nil? is pretty handy.",1438624509

For a typical marriage-like situation, it is wonderful not having to log over to my wife&#x27;s account to gain other prime benefits (shipping was shared, but things like prime video were not). Now both of our accounts are flagged prime for all purposes as far as I can tell.<p>That being said, when my kids are older, it would have been nice if we could grant them this stuff also, and as far as I can tell that is not the case. Only the two adults get the prime, while the kids get just the shared digital library.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that Amazon has been doing nice things in the kids department like the &quot;Amazon Allowance.&quot;[0] Effectively a parent can give a kid some money, and they can use it on Amazon however they wish. So not being able to grant the kids prime on their account effectively means that a lot of the allowance will wind up going to avoidable postage charges (particularly on smaller orders of sub-$25, which I&#x27;d imagine are things an allowance might be utilised on).<p>I almost don&#x27;t wonder if Amazon shouldn&#x27;t change prime in the following way:<p>- Prime postage is now tied to a physical address (not Amazon Account), regardless of sender (e.g. gifts are now prime eligible).<p>- The prime account holder gets a certain number of prime &quot;credits&quot; they can use to send prime packages to other physical addresses, like friends and relatives.<p>Effectively this means if you pay $100/year your address is now Prime flagged. So no matter who sends the item, it gets prime postage. So all household members, or people sending you gifts.<p>Such a change would be controversial, but it would solve the &quot;household problem&quot; since now whoever lives there gets the prime no matter what their relationship to the account holder or similar.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=11453461011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=11453461011</a>",1438624273

Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending.

This is a shift we&#x27;ve been seeing in <i>many</i> languages and I think actually tangibly solves a real problem in a transformative way. By that I mean, people will actually think about problems differently. Especially in JavaScript where everything is asynchronous, you need first class support of asynchronocity.<p>There are a bunch of feature I &quot;like&quot; in ES6 but are ultimately useless in my opinion. Arrow functions are great, but could 1) be implemented in a transpolar, and 2) unfortunately behave different with regard to this and thus make the language even harder to understand (why did all my code break when I switched out the arrow function for a normal inline function?).<p>Classes are horrible in my opinion, especially if they start inspiring people to use instanceof, which is a broken feature in Javascript (and hence why we need things like Array.isArray). Due to the fact that in JavaScript you will often have code from different contexts, you can&#x27;t rely on these checks, and the old-style JS programming encourages you to use feature detection, whereas now you will think you can do something like this. The species properties (so map returns the right thing when you subclass Array for example), is even more complex. The fact that I can subclass Function is a bit absurd. The fact that subclassing Object, vs subclassing null, vs no subclass will be a lot of fun to understand.<p>Let scope is fine I guess, I honestly never thought this was a big deal (coming from C and having to make the switch). It was of course implemented with TDZ which makes it incredibly hard to write in a transpiler, so now you have situations where the transpired code will work but once real let is added your code will break.",1438623981

9998124,comment,9995788,9995788,0,0,jasode,,,"<i>>Personally, I’m a big fan of simplicity and minimalism in programming language design. I think that smaller languages have the potential to be easier to implement, optimize, teach, debug and understand. </i><p>After reading hundreds of blogs and articles about this or that programming language being supposedly &quot;<i>simple</i>&quot;, sentences like the above have come to mean <i>nothing</i>.<p>I wish a had a succinct meme to describe what actually happens in the real world around &quot;simple&quot; languages but the concepts are:<p>If there&#x27;s a &quot;small&quot; or &quot;simple&quot; FORMAL language specification, it means there&#x27;s a &quot;large&quot; INFORMAL language out in the wild.  The &quot;informal&quot; will include things like idioms, patterns, macros, code generators, industry practices, &quot;utility&quot; javascript libraries, etc.<p>For example, take the concept of &quot;classes&quot; that supposedly nobody needs in Javscript (because protoype chains are superior).  What is the longest most complicated chapter of Nicholas Zaka&#x27;s Javscript books[1]?!  It&#x27;s the long chapter on manually simulating classes using prototypes!  Same situation with other books that describe home-grown &quot;modules&quot;.  Even if one chooses to avoid simulated classes in his own js code, one still has to understand the different variations that others write.  If classes are not <i>formally</i> specified in the language spec, it&#x27;s <i>informally</i> specified in everyone else&#x27;s books, stackoverflow answers, blog articles, and youtube videos explaining js simulated classes.  If Javascript had &quot;classes&quot; earlier than ES6, perhaps the over abundance of informal adhoc &quot;class objects&quot; would have been completely avoided.<p>Another example would be &quot;optional default&quot; function parameters.  Since javascript&#x27;s <i>formal</i> language spec doesn&#x27;t have a feature for default params, it is &quot;simpler&quot; and &quot;easier to learn&quot;.  (Hey, if one doesn&#x27;t have to memorize the keyword &quot;optional&quot;, that&#x27;s one less thing to worry about, right?)   Hmmm... really?!   Look again more closely.[2]  The &quot;optional&quot; feature is simply moved into an idiom (multiple idioms!) that all competent javascript programmers must learn.  The &quot;smaller&quot; language hasn&#x27;t saved any complexity -- it does the opposite -- it made JS usage <i>more</i> complex overall.<p><i>Any</i> language that&#x27;s used for non-trivial purposes will not be &quot;simple&quot; if looked at holistically by combining both the formal <i>and</i> informal real-world uses of it.<p>However, within that unavoidable complexity, there can be limited subset cases of &quot;simple&quot; for certain scenarios.    What does one want a &quot;simple&quot; Javascript language spec for and what can it do?  Make the monkey dance?[3]  Ok, that&#x27;s one mapping of &quot;simple&quot; to an end goal and 1995 Javascript specification is probably enough.  However, people want to do much more complex apps with Javascript without having to mess around with Typescript, Babel transpiler, etc.<p>To blog writers:  please stop characterizing languages as &quot;simple&quot; without any qualifications of use cases.  That adjective is no longer convincing on its own.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nic...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/148901/is-there-a-better-way-to-do-optional-function-parameters-in-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/148901/is-there-a-better-...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/221658"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/221658</a>",1438623681

You&#x27;ll be pitched to by about a hundred or more Bangladeshi immigrants to come and have a fitted suit and some shirts made. They&#x27;ll measure you, you give them a day, then come in for a second fitting, pick your new duds up the third day. The price will be comparable to Marshall&#x27;s or TJ Maxx or deeply discounted (like clearance priced) US retail, if you don&#x27;t negotiate hard. If you&#x27;re a good negotiator, you can do much better. Nathan Rd. in Hong Kong is the most well known; there is a shop named Sam&#x27;s that is world famous, but the prices are much higher. Beijing also has a similar area or two where the quality is the same and the prices are even cheaper, one of them is near the pearl market. I&#x27;ve never been to Shanghai, but I&#x27;d bet anything they have the same kind of thing. The ones in Beijing are like any other Beijing market, hundreds of independent vendors in one complex. The tailors in HK are usually in little store-fronts adjacent to Nathan Rd. If you know your measurements, you can send them to one of these shops and they will mail you the clothes, assuming you can find a trustworthy one and not a scammer.<p>I had a wool suit made and it fits me well enough. I&#x27;ve never had a problem finding suits that would fit me off the rack though, so it&#x27;s mostly a novelty. I also wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the way the trousers fit, but I didn&#x27;t have time to have them re-made. They are very well-constructed and durable though, and have lasted several years now. The best thing was the shirts, I bought a dozen at about $13 USD each, IIRC. I have long arms and I can rarely find shirts off the racks that have correct-length sleeves and aren&#x27;t too big everywhere else. These shirts fit well, and are comfortable to wear, and look good. I&#x27;ve worn them a fair amount and they&#x27;ve lasted a few years. The only problem is that the buttons were ruined by the dry cleaners on a couple of the shirts. The buttons were apparently cheap, I chose them myself; but I apparently can&#x27;t look at a button and judge whether it can withstand dry cleaning/pressing. This happens to some of my store-bought shirts too. I might order another dozen of these shirts, because they were cheaper and much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever bought retail. That is if I get brave enough to do an internet transaction since I have no plans to go to HK any time soon.",1438623209

For one, it doesn&#x27;t take into account that plugins/browsers are constantly getting updated. This causes the user-agent string and the plugin names to constantly change, causing the site to report more entropy than there really is. For instance, I&#x27;m using firefox on windows 8.1. Based on the market share of windows 8.1 (13%) and firefox (11%), the chance that another browser has the same user-agent should be 1 in 70. However panopticlick reports 1 in 943.29.

That&#x27;s fucking hard and people don&#x27;t want to do hard today when they come home from work.  They would rather sit and watch their own shit on their device because parenting is hard. Just look around the mall, airport or a dinner table. We&#x27;re not talking about 12 year olds.  These kids are 2, 4, 5, 7 and 9, etc... Their brains are developing and technology, scientifically proven, gets in the way of brain development- just like TV and video games in my gen. It&#x27;s not bad, in moderation, just like everything else in this world.  So, it&#x27;s not about the tech it&#x27;s about the family.  My 9 yr old kid reads 5-10 books a week.  She looses herself in her books to the point she can&#x27;t hear anyone.  Learning, safely, for the most part. Using her imagination instead of it being fed to her by the vast majority of the shit out there. she gets to play learning and thinking games, not fruit ninja.

I fucking want yell at a parent who is out to dinner with 2,3,4 year olds at the table playing with an iPad. While the parent is buried in their own. I limited the tech not because it&#x27;s tech, trendy and cool to do so but, because we want our kids to be able to communicate with other human beings and the ability resolve conflict through something other than a text or Facebook.  They will have plenty of opportunities to be immersed into technology and all troublesome things that come with it as a teen.<p>I know technology is empowering at the right age. But, I want both my kids to be exposed to cooking, knitting, skateboarding, swimming, playing sports, books, music and art by actually doing it versus it being fed to them on an iPad.

There are a few people that consistently make money, like Warren Buffet. But they play on very small edges. Sorta like poker, they consistently come out a few percent ahead of the competition. But there&#x27;s terrible variance. Is this likely to be a tool that gives real market insight? No.<p>The other part of Wall Street is like matthew mcconaughey in the wolf of wall street. It&#x27;s getting people&#x27;s money in the circus. Go around and around the ferris wheel again and again. This is the sort of thing that can convince people to invest.<p>I seriously doubt i&#x27;d put my own money in just because of this. But people like that exist, and really, they&#x27;re probably better off with some money in stocks. They&#x27;ll get a better return than a savings account.

My code looks good at the time and it usually looks well-factored, but entropy and shortcuts always seem to creep in there.  Pile all those errors up over a 5 year timespan on code that slowly accretes since I&#x27;m maintaining it on my leisure time, and I always wind up with really untrustworthy code and occasional frustrating regressions when I make changes.<p>The test suite with good coverage gives me confidence that the code continues to work as I make changes (no regression bugs.)  It&#x27;s about having complete trust in my code, no second guessing, and no time ever wasted in a debugger chasing down issues.<p>And, I want to be able to cut a build at any time as long as all of my tests pass and feel confident I&#x27;m not shipping a broken build.  I&#x27;ve never been able to do that on any project in the past, and I think it will be one mark of success on this new project.  I&#x27;ve implemented a mini feature toggle system in my build scripts to make that possible.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m using Closure Compiler with full optimizations in my production build to do minification.  Closure Compiler itself can (theoretically) break the build with its over-aggressive optimizations, so part of having a complete coverage test suite is being able to run the tests against the production build and catch any bad optimizations that CC makes.  Because of my architectural choices, I REALLY need that test suite.<p>Do I need to write the tests before the production code (do full TDD) or can I write tests after?  Well, I am the type of guy who won&#x27;t write the tests after because I always want to move on to the next fun thing.  I just force myself to do it, and take my medicine up front.",1438622259

After playing around with various NoSql stores, I&#x27;ve come to the following conclusion:<p>If you want a super scalable eventually consistent database, use one of the more minimally structured global key value store type DBs like Cassandra. In this case you do not want SQL&#x27;s guarantees or structure, so don&#x27;t go there.<p>If you want a structured database with ACID guarantees, just use XXXXing SQL.<p>NoSql databases that have attempted to implement structured data, consistency guarantees, rules, ACID or near-ACID semantics, etc., have all started to basically just converge with SQL. They end up re-implementing SQL but with a less consistent, hackier query language and they miss spots. They&#x27;ve gone around the circle and re-invented the wheel and in many cases ended up with an inferior one to boot.<p>Sure SQL is old. So is math. SQL is rooted in set theory and other pieces of immortal mathematical truth. It&#x27;s a great example of a software system designed around ageless mathematical concepts that will always be valid. It could use some syntactic modernization, but the core of it will be as useful in a million years as it is today. Learn how to properly structure a database (normalization, DRY, etc.) and how to use its more obscure abilities (esoteric joins) and you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s amazingly powerful.<p>PostgreSQL is fantastic because it&#x27;s doing just that: a bit of modernization around a solid core. It gives you SQL when you want structured data, and it also give you JSON columns when you want to store blobs of unstructured data in the database. So it kind of gives you the best of both worlds: SQL plus a JSON document store. You can (to some extent) query your JSON columns too, though if you intend to do this a lot I&#x27;d recommend moving that data into SQL-land.<p>This facilitates a kind of iterated development where you throw temporary and less structured data into JSON columns, then if you discover later that this data wants to be more long-lived and structured you migrate it to real SQL columns. It&#x27;s a very agile/YAGNI way of doing things -- do it quick at first, then optimize and clean up once you know what wants to live where and what&#x27;s really important.",1438621733

Most or every icon on these home screens are native apps because mobile websites do not easily allow or make obvious that it&#x27;s possible to have an app icon on the home screen. Thus, native will always win this battle.<p>When the day comes that it might be easier to see a mixture of native and web apps on the home screen, unless mobile web is faster than it currently is (meaning updating changing best practices, using excellent APIs like SW and designing for offline first access), users will STILL choose native over web when half or more than half the time they do exactly the same thing.<p>Native is here to stay for years to come unless the mobile web can offer a compelling reason to switch to browser based layouts. I&#x27;m cheering for the web to provide a better content experience but we&#x27;re still a long way off and can expect web based layouts to be wrapped with native code and wrappers. Maybe web isn&#x27;t the place for everything but a universal bytecode for everything is a dream that could be reality as long as progress is made.",1438621697

My phone is ringing off the hook even after I&#x27;ve removed my number from the job boards, &#x27;cause I have a pretty cushy gig right now, while he gets almost nothing.   He&#x27;s one of the smartest guys I know, and he&#x27;s not crazy, no record or nothing, he&#x27;s just kinda shy and comes off as... well, people tend to think he&#x27;s shorter than he is.<p>Which is fuckin&#x27; weird, &#x27;cause who cares, right?  this isn&#x27;t sales.  the man can program.<p>Now, he does have a handful of real problems.  First, he takes interviews seriously;  like he stops looking for work when he gets a serious one.   He doesn&#x27;t look for work while he&#x27;s working.   And he wants a job where he has experience with the languages and frameworks, rather than practicing his &quot;I&#x27;ve got hands, I&#x27;m sure I can figure it out&quot;  that the rest of us do.   To be clear, he&#x27;s worked with me before, and I have seen him pick up new stuff.  He&#x27;s a smart guy and picks up new stuff faster than most, he just doesn&#x27;t want to be deceptive.<p>(If anyone is looking for a smart C++ dude, preferably someone using QT, lemme know, I&#x27;ll hook you up.)<p>The funny thing is that I just got off of working for my own company for a long time (not ten years... about half that)  and yeah, it&#x27;s harder to get back in the game working for other people;  I&#x27;m making less than several of my ex-employees, and I had to do way more interviews than I usually do (though, as I said in another post, that might be because I was confused about what &#x27;devops&#x27; meant, in a job description)<p>So... working for yourself at a company that wasn&#x27;t venture backed is a disadvantage, but not one that can&#x27;t be overcome.

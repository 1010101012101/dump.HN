Many applications don&#x27;t always behave well in containers, and the container model requires not only that your app work in container environments, but that your development and deployment process works with containers.<p>I suspect that many organizations will start to migrate apps to containers, see that they require a fundamentally different set of tools and processes, and migrate back.  The reason VMs work as well as they do is that they look just like regular servers.<p>That does not mean that containers will never succeed, just that it will take a long time for the tooling and processes and knowledge about containers to be common and commodity enough for many organizations to take advantage of them.",1420126580

Debug the running application.<p>3. Observe the network traffic.<p>Here&#x27;s another thing to think about. Suppose the source code were available.

Contacts come up, down, in out of either the car or the docking station.<p>Contacts like the ones on the end of Musk&#x27;s proposed robot arm, perhaps.<p>> Put simply. I, and I would guess this is true for most people, have exactly zero interest in my auto-drive car returning home, opening the garage and driving in to charge. Why? Well, more than one reason. Let&#x27;s just say that bedroom communities would be prime for burglaries. All you have to do is wait for auto cars to let you in.<p>> First, you just doubled traffic and congestion. If every car is a self-driver and they all return home, you now created a mess of traffic as every car now has somewhere else to go rather than just being parked for the work day.<p>Frankly, I expect self-driving cars to change the model of car ownership for a lot of people. I hate owning a car. An Uber-style &quot;I need a ride&quot; solution would be much better for how I use cars, and self-driving + self-charging makes that possible.<p>> You don&#x27;t have kids, do you? There is no way in the universe that I would leave my kids inside my self-driving car to be delivered to school. That, on the face of it, is also a ridiculous idea. It would be beyond irresponsible to leave kids in a car driving around town given that, well, shit happens.<p>I&#x27;ve got two five year olds, and I&#x27;d be fine with that.

Specifically, I'd like to build a service (probably using RoR) that acts as an aggregator for these webhooks.<p>Imagine that I sign up as jgrahamc on <a href=""http://somethingmoved.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://somethingmoved.org/</a> (that was my idea for the name) and a look at <a href=""http://somethingmoved.org/jgrahamc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://somethingmoved.org/jgrahamc</a> would give me a 'twitter' style feed of posts that have been made to me.<p>Then I'd be able to assign endpoints that I could use for specific services, so suppose I decide to use github I might define <a href=""http://somethingmoved.org/jgrahamc/github"" rel=""nofollow"">http://somethingmoved.org/jgrahamc/github</a> and give that URL to github for the post-receive URL.<p>On my page I can define how that gets added to my feed (perhaps part of the XML document is extracted and added as a simple line of text, and of course for common services there could be ready made templates of what to do).<p>If standard service endpoints were done right then you can imagine going to a FedEx tracking page and finding a 'SomethingMoved' button where you are asked to enter just the main part of your URL (e.g. <a href=""http://somethingmoved.org/jgrahamc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://somethingmoved.org/jgrahamc</a>) and FedEx could automatically tack on /fedex which would then have a standard handling.<p>Then I also say that this github message should be passed on to other services (perhaps many, perhaps just RunCodeRun).  Clearly I could do some transformation before passing things on.  For example, I might pass on to RunCodeRun unchanged, but extract part and pass to Twitter.<p>Anyone got time to work on hacking this together with me in RoR?  (I really need someone who's good with web UI hacking since I'm an application guts kind of guy).",1234281598

For instance, it'd be nice if I could log into my bank and set a url that they post to every time a transaction happens. Then I could set up a service at that url to take their message and do something with it (email myself, send an sms, automatically enter the transaction in buxfer, etc).<p>Same for statements. Instead of sending me an email, just let me specify a url. When my statement is ready, it's posted (in json or xml format) to a url I specify. Then I can slice and dice my own financial data and update my long term cashflow graph, or something.<p>Since the url is specified by me, while logged into my account (which should be secure), I have total control over who has my data (assuming DNS is secure and I provide an https url). If I wanted to use a service like Mint or Buxfer, I could add their callback urls to my account. When I decided to stop using their service, I simply remove the urls from the account. There is no need for Mint/Buxfer to know my login credentials or even what bank I use.",1234281431

There are a myriad of highly talented rappers who's songs are rooted in meaningful, thought provoking subjects. And the same goes for any genre.<p>Musicians themselves are exploring various niches and the audiences that await them in every corner of the music world. And as a result, have a smaller fanbase. The reason why you still hear the same garbage on KROQ and why the top 10 acts are ancient is because those are the musicians that have been proven to appeal to the widest audience. And with the top 10 acts, I'm going to guess that a big part of their fanbase is composed of 30+ year old individuals who are going to stick around for a while with their static tastes in music. Basing the state of the music world on who the top 10 performing acts are is a bit foolish. There's a whole lot happening.<p>My iTunes library is filled with music of recent artists who's music is of high quality. You can't just turn on the radio now to find good music, even via Pandora or Rhapsody. Don't fool yourself by thinking that Pandora is really giving you an in depth look to the various genres of music. It really isn't. You have to work a bit harder than that.",1234281186

The test cases would expand to consume all the resources available for development.  All you would get done is writing all but impossible test cases.

There's a major chicken/egg problem here: society doesn't appreciate music in the same way, there is less openness among the general population, drugs aren't nearly as accepted, not nearly the same number of people go to music festivals etc. etc. etc. It is more of a cultural shift than the decline of music as an isolated phenomenon.<p>If you start dragging out the ""everything was better before"" argument, remember that you'll get more than the music if you go back to 1970. War, the draft, unemployment, massive amounts of LSD...<p>I haven't seen any commenter in this thread attempt a somewhat scientific assessment of the quality of music then and now. We can probably agree that the general culture is less friendly to good music today, but if you want to go deeper than that there is really no way to reach a consensus. I'm of the belief that you can find just as novel, inspired, creative and emotional music today as 30 years ago. There might be a bit less and it will certainly be more obscure, but artists still create. As a case in point, both Marilyn Manson, Dream Theater and The Cardigans have created large amounts of novel music the last 10 years. Even though these musicians aren't among the most obscure, I still think you're doomed to fail if you search the pop charts for good art.",1234279236

475241,comment,474919,474919,0,0,jonsen,,,"Von Neuman architecture sucks. From our educated and elevated point of view I think we can all agree on that. At least if we transcribe to ""programming in machine language sucks"". Perhaps one day we may elevate to agreement on ""OO architecture sucks"".\nOO is a successful technology measured by what has been accomplished with it. The von Neuman architecture is even more successful. The one and only architecture behind all general purpose computers. But no sane programmer would touch machine code directly.\nI have always thought that OO was wrong, in some sense at least. But I have to touch it. There is no higher and better level. There are alternatives but on the same level. So they suck in their own ways.\nI remember when I started forming my mental pictures of what programming in the large was all about. How to think about it. How to structure it in my mind. I read Object-Oriented Modeling and Design by Rumbaugh et.al. Even if the authors didn't succeed in explaining it fully, I got the vivid impression, that they wanted me to believe, that a computer model should be structured along three dimensions: data, functionality and events. A space with a recording axis, data, an activity axis, functions, and a time axis, events. Though a somewhat fuzzy picture, I ""saw"" these three dimensions as orthogonal and of equal importance in structuring and building the complex structures called programs. I find OO to intermingle the data-function-plane but leaving timing in the cold. A skewed space. \nI'm looking forward to the tools and technology, that will support my clean and ""right"" design model in a non-skewed concrete ""code"" space. Well, if they ever arrive, I might then have an even better mental model and find my self stuck with the new and better but sucking tools.",1234279065

475236,comment,473118,473398,0,0,ecarlin,,,"Hey mdasen -<p>Thanks for digging into the details.  Please allow me to clarify a couple of things...<p>1. Average File Size - You have nailed the difference in request fee pricing but failed to point out that 2 of the 5 scenarios show an avg file size of 75KB.  In fact, scenarios 1 and 2 are exactly the same with the exception of file size and were included to specifically highlight the difference in pricing both above and below the 100KB threshold.  Also, in some instances, a smaller avg file size results in Amazon costs being even MORE expensive.  For example, take a look at scenario #5 and set the average file size to 50KB.  The savings with Rack INCREASE from $3,116.97 to $3,525.70.  That's because Amazon charges CDN and origin fetch request fees, neither of which Rack/Mosso does.  The point of the calculator was to make something that is difficult to compare more quantitative.  Your assumption that file sizes over 100KB would always benefit Rackspace is a good example of why the calc was created.  As scenario 5 shows, that's not always the case.  We tried not to pull any punches and make the scenarios reasonable and fair (I'm an architect and don't particularly care for hyped up marketing).  We believe in complete transparency which is also why we make the calculator available.  We encourage anyone and everyone to run their own scenarios.  If there are errors in the calc, that is another story and we welcome feedback so we can fix any that exist.  We recognize we won't be cheaper in EVERY case, but at least people will have the data they need to make an informed decision.<p>2. Incoming Bandwidth Charges - You are correct that incoming BW is temporarily free.  I can't speak in great detail here but we won't simply be introducing an incoming BW charge.  Instead, we'll be making some broader cloud pricing changes that will also impact Files BW pricing.  That's still a bit of a moving target but I have a newer version of the calc that includes these changes and it doesn't change the fundamental result.  When the new pricing is released, we will be releasing a new version of the calculator.  Again, full transparency.  We thought about waiting until the pricing changes go into affect before releasing this analysis, but since there isn't a fundamental difference, we wanted to get the analysis out now.  That said, even with the EXISTING pricing, adding in an incoming BW charge doesn't really change the result.  For example, on the ""Pricing"" tab of the workbook, change the 0 to .10 for ""BW in"" under Cloud Files.  We're still less expensive on all scenarios (with support) and less expensive (or roughly the same) on 4 of the 5 scenarios without support.<p>3. Gigabytes vs. Gibibytes - We measure in increments of 1024, not 1000 and the pricing breakpoints (see the Pricing tab) are the same.  The amount of storage and bandwidth used is an input to the calculator so any number can be entered.  We probably should have used 5120 instead of 5000, etc, etc. so your point is well taken.  I'll update that for the next version.<p>Again, thanks for digging in.  In general, we expect some degree of skepticism (as there SHOULD be when any company produces their own comparative analysis) but we felt there was a very quantifiable message that wasn't being told.  We have tried to be as fair and transparent as we could be in the analysis and we don't necessarily want you to take our word for it.  We encourage any and all to look at the cost and performance for yourself.  If we've made a mistake, let us know so we can fix it.<p>If it would be of use, don't hesitate to e-mail me directly at erik[dot]carlin[at]rackspace.com.<p>Regards,\nErik Carlin",1234278855

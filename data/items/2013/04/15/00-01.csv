Whether that cash is a license from the government to get money from users of an invention, or a straight up check is a public policy issue. If the government funds some research, everyone pays for it whether or not they use it. If the government grants some legal protection that makes it easier to monetize that research from users, then only users pay for it. Which of those is more appropriate is context-specific.",1365987586

The more people you regularly interact with, the more likely it is you'll make a connection.<p>Your school wants you to succeed at this, and you should take advantage of the resources they provide to do so. Ask your RA if he knows of anything fun happening this weekend. Tell them you're looking to make new friends and could use some recommendations of events you should check out. Tell your professors you're really interested in connecting with people who'd like to collaborate on UX projects, and ask him if he knows any other students who are taking the class because of more than just credit. Ask people in the Student Life committee which events are most likely to have people attending who want to make new friends, rather than people attending with existing friends.<p>And if you're feeling depressed or having difficulty connecting with people you'd like to be friends with, talk to counselors in the student health center.

Hackers can generally become very proficient in business in 3~5 years on the job, but a business guy would need 10+ years of focused practice in order to become equally proficient in hacking, and until they learn will be absolutely clueless when working with hackers.<p>And in the early wrestler-dominated days of MMA, people envisioned a future where every MMA athlete would be equally well-rounded in all of the disciplines and such distinctions would become unnecessary. But as is often the case, the reality has turned out a bit differently.<p>A strong wrestling base is still a huge plus and a strong indicator of success - There are 8 weight classes in the UFC and 5 of them are wrestlers. But in general, what has happened is that in order to be a champion or championship contender, one needs to be minimally (i.e. above average) well-rounded in every discipline, but every champion is exceptional in at least one discipline. For example, non-wrestler champions like Anderson Silva (185 lbs) and Jose Aldo (145 lbs) are outstanding kickboxers who are competent enough in wrestling to be able to avoid being taken down. The days of only-specialists are gone and the days of only-generalists never came; the reality has turned out to be a combination of the two.<p>I expect to see the same dynamic in the startup world. Hackers are becoming more business-minded and business guys are (maybe less so) starting to realize the ""power"" and importance of hackers, but I don't expect the two worlds to ever completely converge. It will be important to be world-class in at least one discipline (hacking or marketing or whatever), but everyone will need to be at least above-average in all disciplines to expect to compete at all.",1365986934

5549078,comment,5546679,5547015,11,0,drostie,,,"It's hard to identify a <i>practical</i> reason because presumably using your existing PHP stack is going to be easier for you than learning how to run a Haskell stack. Every new language comes with such barriers. It's sometimes hard to see how severe those barriers are -- I remember trying to show a totally novice-to-programming kid how to set up EasyPHP so that they could start coding. Setting up EasyPHP, which is, well, Easy, requires explaining what HTTP is and what Apache is and all that... it's actually a huge barrier to entry for a novice programmer.<p>But if you're OK with the impractical, here goes:<p>Haskell trains you to think about programming in a couple of subtly different ways that change your entire perspective.<p>(1) Variables are replaced with definitions and values. You probably remember HTTP as stateless and cookies as a sort of informal ""patch"" for this; similarly it's hard to define state in Haskell. This means that `x = [1, 2, 3];` is allowed but `x[1] = 5;` is not, because the list cannot be directly modified. This does not actually weaken the language because you can always bind new names to new values, and idiomatically you'd often use <i>recursion</i> -- when you want to change a parameter you arrange the code so that you can recurse and call the function again with a new parameter. It's not 100% practical but let's take the Fibonacci numbers, which you might code in PHP like so:<p><pre><code>    function fibs($n) {\n        $curr = 0; $next = 1;\n        for ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) {\n            $tmp = $curr;\n            $curr = $next;\n            $next += $tmp;\n        }\n        return $curr;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn Haskell you could write this itero-recursively as:<p><pre><code>    let fibs n = f n 0 1\n      where f n curr next = if n < 1 then curr else f (n - 1) (next) (curr + next)\n</code></pre>\nNotice that there's no $tmp and the named variables are now function arguments. You'll find yourself writing PHP more like:<p><pre><code>    function fibs($n, $curr = 0, $next = 1) {\n        return n < 1 ? $curr : fibs($n - 1, $next, $curr + $next);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n(2) Haskell is lazy. The above is actually <i>impure</i> because it implements `fibs` as a function when really the Fibonacci numbers are a sequence and should be treated that way. Haskell actually has no problem with defining the infinite list of Fibonaccis as:<p><pre><code>    fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)\n</code></pre>\nThat's a list just like any other in Haskell, it just happens to be infinite. Or, you can write the infinite list of primes:<p><pre><code>    primes = 2 : filter prime [3..]\n      where prime k = all (\n -> mod k n /= 0) (takeWhile (\n -> n^2 <= k) primes)\n</code></pre>\nYou will miss this a little in other languages; even Python, which can do this with custom generators, gets a little clumsy. Especially, I miss this in Node.js, where the whole language is built around an idea of ""callbacks"" which wouldn't need to exist if the JavaScript operators could work on deferred computations (sometimes called ""promises"").<p>(3) Haskell has a type system and explicit pattern-matching. This is a little harder to express: you're used to saying `x = my_object->x` in PHP to avoid saying ""x"" over and over. Let's say that the object should also have ""y"" and ""z"" fields; then you'll have to deal with cryptic errors if your function is ever called with a my_object which does not have a field named ""x"", but it will be okay if ""y"" or ""z"" is not allowed, even though that doesn't actually make sense really!<p>In Haskell you'll specify in the definition of the argument ""Object x y z""; and then x, y, pattern-matching to those respective values. So your functions don't start off with a bunch of ""data-extraction"" commands; those commands are in the input pattern. You can also define the function when the patterns do not match, because you can define a function several times for different patterns.<p>The type system can also flag, for example, unsanitized text going into a SQL query and other such things you might have missed, so you can lean on it a surprising amount.<p>(4) The biggest thing that this page was talking about was <i>monads</i>, and the reason why it was talking about them is because Haskell offers a <i>special notation</i> for dealing with monads.<p>A monad is basically a context which you can't necessarily ""break the data out of"". For example, the ""IO"" monad is a context which says ""this data depends on an unrepeatable IO action, like getting a random number or reading a file."" You can't really erase that fact from the data, but that fact shouldn't stand in the way of handling the data. The IO monad allows you to very cleanly separate the stuff which might be different in two different runs of the program, from the stuff which is never so.<p>The author makes the claim that analogies are bad for understanding monads. Instead, you should just look at the definition. A monad is a typeclass which wraps another type, so the type is ""M(T)"" where T is any other type. A monad is defined by two functions. One is called ""return"" and has type T -> M(T), it puts plain data into the monad. The other function is called ""bind"" and accepts a function T -> M(T2), which intuitively ""takes the data and feeds it to the function."" The reason that you can't always ""break out"" of the monad is that the output of this function is M(T2), so the function output must also be in the monad. We know that ""monad"" is a scary-sounding word but really nobody has a better name for it.<p>Lists are a good monad; here `return x = [x]` and `bind xs f = concat (map f xs)`. Another simple monad is called Maybe, which can either be `Just x` or `Nothing`, it sort of represents a computation which might fail. Here `return x = Just x` and `bind Nothing fn = Nothing; bind (Just x) fn = fn x`. There's also a ""State"" monad, which gives you a ""put"" and ""get"" method and a scope block for typed modifiable variables, so you can have code that looks imperative -- but you've got to carefully mark it as such with the type system as a whole. The whole point being that once you allow that ""put"" statement you make it much harder to think about bugs because the value of the parameter will depend on where in the function that parameter appears -- so the type system acts as a warning flag.",1365986269

I live on campus as an RA and am in freshman level classes. I feel like I can offer a unique perspective to you, here are my thoughts for whatever they are worth.<p>Don't discount your relationship with your roommate. I know you are looking to other people, and thats fine, but if you two get along that is important. My first time through college was the typical drink/party/girls experience. I made friends and lived with the same group of guys all 4 years. Now, 5+ years later, there is ONE person from college that I am still close with. He is the only one I consider a ""life-long"" friend. After school he moved in with me and got a job at my company. He met his wife at work, they moved to Cali then to Chicago. They're doing great. A single friendship can make a huge difference...also, this friend and I didn't even know each other freshman year.<p>Freshman year is tumultuous. Many of the people you see all buddy-buddy right now will hate each other before the end of next year. A lot changes during college and much of it in first two years. Don't stress about friends too much yet, nothing is settled, it just APPEARS to be settled.<p>Don't try too hard. This will sabotage your efforts. In my first freshman year I had a tough time when my group of friends started mixing with this other group and those new kids didn't like me very much. I tried so hard to earn their approval and be a part of the group but nothing worked. Eventually I got flat-out fed-up and angry. I said ""F<i></i>* them."" I started doing my own thing and almost instantly they responded with acceptance. Kids can tell when you are trying hard to make something happen and, for whatever reason, they respond negatively to that. Do whatever it is you like to do, do it well, be proud, be confident, be pleasant and people will gravitate towards you. This will create opportunities for you to create a relationship.<p>PLEASE don't internalize this. What you are going through does NOT mean people won't/don't accept you or people don't like you. It just means that you haven't made the right connection yet. Making friends is serendipitous to a large degree, the right comment at the right time, a well placed quip, etc. Things come together and it just happens.<p>And now for some advice,<p>In high school I moved from the east coast to the west coast for my father's job. I had never had to ""make friends"" before. I experimented and ranked the best ways to ""make friends"" They were: talk about sports, talk about music, talk about movies. I'm a big movie fan so I used movies a lot. Quoting movies is an incredibly effective way to start conversations. I still use it to this day. (I don't know what you kids watch these days, the harry potter and whatnot but for me its lots of Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and American Psycho.) They can be obscure quotes and/or obscure movies, whatever. Quotes are good because when someone else recognizes the quote it says ""you and I like and notice the same weird/funny things."" without saying it. You don't need to be funny or over-the-top about it, just throw it out there and see who responds. If no one responds don't feel awkward, its just something you've seen that they haven't.<p>This year I have found the after-class-food tactic seems to work pretty well. Towards the end of class, when you are packing up ask someone if they want to get some food, I have found that most kids without another class head to the cafeteria. This is an easy, low-pressure approach.<p>Practice, practice, practice. Socializing is a technique like a golf swing. Practice makes perfect. Try different things out, now is the time to do that. You will crash and burn sometimes, THATS OK, everyone does. Those crashes will mean nothing to you looking back. Just keep practicing and you will get better. Remember what works and what doesn't. Incorporate and adapt.<p>I hope some of this helps, I tried to be honest and straight-forward. I'll leave you with this postamble,<p>I've lurked on HN for quite some time now. A couple years I think. I've never posted anything because I've never felt confident enough in any of my thoughts to broadcast them to such an intelligent and awe-inspiring community. This is my first post because I feel confident in saying to you that it will work out. I can see just from what you've written that you have good things to offer. It's in the honesty and thought of your words. I know this is important to you but don't stress too much. Don't get too caught up in it. It will happen for you.<p>Please feel free to message me if you want to talk more.",1365985870

It creates a game that strikes a perfect balance between giving you power to manipulate the world and giving you simple enough tools to manipulate the world. 3D editors exist but only very few people find playing around and creating worlds with them to be fun. Minecraft is much less powerful than a 3D editor (since it restricts you to those 111 meter blocks), but by reducing that power it is able to give you accessible tools.

5548989,comment,5547423,5548542,4,0,utunga,,,"The whole point of the trillion dollar coin idea was that it allowed the executive (aka the president) to create money without asking the Fed (and thus by pass the congressional deb-ceiling debate). This only illustrates the point that president doesn't directly control the Fed - he does appoint the chairperson (Bernanke, Greenspan et al) but he cannot order them to print money. The treasury however does have responsibility for minting actual coins, usually treated as a minor housekeping type matter (because the vast bulk of money is not actual physical coins and notes, of course) and even then only under congressional mandate.<p>In the case of the trillion dollar coin they had passed legislation that the Treasury was to be given the leeway to print a new platinum coin - if they wished, and at their discretion as to its denomination.<p>All of which is to say that this whole trillion dollar coin thing only emphasizes the extent to which the president does <i>not</i> control the Fed.<p>FWIW this is very common in western democracies. Even when the central bank is not a privately owned institution it is almost always managed in a very hands-off way, ostensibly (though perhaps not practically) to stop short term administrations from playing with things in a way that might affect long term currency stability.",1365984572

About half a year ago, we were reiterating so much that it made sense to just start building a custom template for ourselves that we could tweak and improve so we could reiterate faster. This prototype is quick even for us, but this time we had a really clear idea of what we wanted to build, and how to get there, so this prototype is the first step.",1365984568
5548987,comment,5546473,5548603,1,0,dllthomas,,,"Yes.  Pen testers are rattling off the ~60% of passwords that were chosen poorly, all of which were chosen by methods other than the one detailed in the comic.<p>Just placing an emphasis on password length and irregularity leaves people still with the question of <i>how</i> they generate that long, irregular password.  Asking them to do it in their head in any way is going to lead to much success by way of dictionary attacks.<p>I'm coming to the realization (giving you some credit) that your objection may be to a specific piece of the comic's particular presentation: ""random"" is often used to mean ""arbitrary"" and people might think they can do it in their head?  Of course I agree that anything people do with their heads is almost certainly insecure - brains are piss-poor sources of entropy. Would your objection be fixed entirely if it called out explicitly that the words need to be picked mechanically (computer, dice, something) with a uniform distribution?<p>Anyway, the thing that I like about the comic is that it presents a specific means of choosing a password that is simultaneously secure and memorable, and the only misconception involved would be from misinterpretation of the comic (which, as noted above, does seem possible).  Anything else someone comes up with on their own is likely to be less secure, less memorable, or both, so referring to the comic as promulgating a misconception bugs me.<p>Regarding the last, I don't think we were ever arguing about passphrases in general, but about a particular way of generating them... passphrase really just means ""long password"", more or less, and that doesn't provide a lot of guidance as to how to come up with one, and leaving people to their own devices is how we wind up with ~60% of passwords being horribly crackable.",1365984562

5548968,comment,5547437,5548311,4,0,Starmie,,,"I understand your point about merit being correlated with income and class. It is obviously true that wealthy, upper-class high school seniors will have higher test scores, more impressive accomplishments, and (frankly) superior academic abilities when compared with their lower-class counterparts.  But you must know that this is attributable to differences in upbringing and opportunities, with varying levels of immediate relevancy (e.g. SAT tutoring, better teachers, parents who introduce intellectual discourse into the home). This means that any supposedly ""pure"" meritocracy, which does not account for those differences of opportunity, is going to be heavily biased towards those who were born into privilege. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of class immobility that, I think, most people  find undesirable. If you don't agree with the idea that two children with equal natural talents should, in a perfect world, have equal opportunities to pursue those talents, then I'd love to hear your version of meritocracy.<p>When you say ""holistic"" admissions, I'm not sure whether you mean holistic in the sense that colleges use it (i.e. taking evidence of talent outside of grades and test scores into account) or as a reference to programs which take race or class into account. Either way, you present standardized tests as the more meritocratic approach, which is silly. A perfect SAT score means a student is great at basic math, reading, and writing in an extremely specific context. That can be an extremely useful foundation, but do you honestly think that indicates this student is the ""best?"" That someone with lower scores who has published a bestselling book or won an international science prize or started a great humanitarian effort is on a lower tier in the meritocracy? Of course, all of these things are biased even more heavily towards rich students, but that's why class and background must also be taken into account.<p>I suspect I may have misunderstood parts of what you were saying, so please do clarify (if you can make it through my little word dump :P).",1365984210

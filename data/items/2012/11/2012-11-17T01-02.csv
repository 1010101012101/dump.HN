Depends on your use-case. I wasn't at the talk (and haven't watched the video, yet), but apparently there was a bit of a 'heated' debate during the question portion of the talk. Apparently some people from the scientific Python community have given up waiting for their issues to be addressed and are working on their own packaging solution to meet their needs.<p>If most of your modules are pure-Python or maybe a little bit of C, then you might not be running into the warts that the current packaging systems have.<p>Also, running 'pip install package' hides what kind of lengths that developers/package maintainers have to go through to get things working correctly. That's also part of the discussion when talking about a decent packaging system.<p><pre><code>  > I often miss the virtualenv + pip approach
</code></pre>
Perl's ""perlbrew + cpanm"" approach is more fully featured. I miss having a 'requirements.txt' type capability, but perlbrew downloads/compiles Perl, so each environment can have a different version of Perl, which is a little more complex with virtualenv.",1353117183

Real, physical, well-made books are pieces of art onto themselves -- something we've lost in reading these things on a flat, lifeless screen.<p>Digital books can be more than simply text on a screen as well; I noticed in a recent Amazon title that passages which were frequently highlighted by other users were set differently (I think it was a highlight as well; I can't remember the title I saw it in). Never mind the privacy concerns; it's the morphing of a medium.<p>On the other hand, applying the skeuomorphs of such a thing cheapens it. It's a mask, trying to hide its nature. For me, it's almost an uncanny valley feel.

The reality is that the salary doesn't translate to the figures promised unless you actually sell like you life depends on it. So they do just that. The dead sea stuff is just one type of product, manufactured by nondescript factories and arguably not so 'dead sea'.

The techniques are similar and they are controlled by a few companies. 
There are even ads where they recruit based on having a US tourist visa alone (i.e., work illegaly until caught). This got so worst that the US embassy created a short film warning young Israelis of that scam, and the airports in London will hold any young Israeli coming in on suspicion of being a mall-stall fodder.

Please tell me I'm overreacting and should just relax a little more, because I sometimes feel that mainstream newspaper articles are borderline bullying. To a point where I've actually started thinking about forming a lobbying group to fight for more respect in the portrayal of technically inclined people like us.<p>Just a thought experiment: next time you come across an article that talks about ""nerds"" try replacing every instance of that word with ""gays"". Not that the result would make much sense but I think the gay community, despite their ongoing struggle, has at least managed to make it almost impossible to receive a similar kind of media report that consists of nothing but stereotypes.<p>If you do the above experiment, I'm sure you'll the offensive subtext in some articles, the self-content righteousness in making fun of those people who created everything modern society cannot be without: facebook, twitter, the internet, apps, you name it.<p>Maybe it's because technical people seem harmless that they think they can get away with their bullying. But I think it's about time to stand up against it and make our voices heard.<p>P.S.: I'm not saying that this particular article is worse than the rest. As a matter of fact, it's quite okay, compared to some others I've read. So maybe this comment is misplaced in this thread in which case I apologize.",1353114539

The reason I can't support them is because they operate as if they are the the owners of the truth and the deciders of what is right. Its okay to have strong opinions, think you're right, and stand for what you believe it but the same mentality that allows Anonymous to do just about anything to anyone they deem ""wrong"" or ""oppressors"" is the same mentality that promotes people blowing themselves up on crowded subways.

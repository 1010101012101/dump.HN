9149609,comment,9148746,9149257,0,0,mjn,,,"My second-hand understanding of the arrangement is that from 1997 until roughly the mid 2000s, Maxis&#x27;s autonomy was mostly protected by Will Wright&#x27;s personal clout (plus possibly some terms around the acquisition, if there were any). He was high-profile, a charismatic media figure, and very against moving to EA&#x27;s main campus in Redwood Cityâ€”partly to retain Maxis&#x27;s autonomy, and partly just because he lived in the East Bay and didn&#x27;t want to commute to the Peninsula.<p>It helped that the first post-acquisition new title from Maxis was <i>The Sims</i>, a massive financial success, which allowed EA to feel comfortable taking a hands-off approach and allowing the studio to do weird things, so long as the weird things brought in piles of revenue.<p>From the mid-2000s, though, EA started merging bits of Maxis in, closing the Walnut Creek office and moving those staff to Redwood City, but still leaving a smaller Maxis remaining in Emeryville, which continued to be headed by Wright, with considerable autonomy. He used that autonomy to lead the <i>Spore</i> (2008) development, an ambitious concept that was not a financial success (though it arguably kicked off the current resurgence of procedural content generation in games). And then he left the company in 2009. At that point I think many people in the industry considered it inevitable that the remaining Maxis would be moved to the main EA campus sooner or later.",1425538398

It&#x27;s just multitasking.</i><p>It isn&#x27;t multi-tasking, that&#x27;s just our autonomic nervous system learning to drive a car and goes further than hitting brakes - driving a car becomes all automatic, with gestures that include switching gears, stopping at red lights and so on. It&#x27;s the same system that&#x27;s responsible for breathing - you don&#x27;t need to remember to breath, right? And it&#x27;s what we call reflex.<p>Humans are actually bad at multi-tasking. It&#x27;s cooperative multitasking at best, requiring expensive context switches, which is really the reason for why many of us can&#x27;t do software development while talking on the phone or while having other distractions around us. For some reason women seem to be better at multitasking, not sure how that works.<p>Also, as a funny personal experience ...

I first want to say that as someone who works in robotics, I want the automation revolution to come as much as the next guy. As a matter of fact, you are probably going to be hard pressed to find a demographic on this site that thinks differently. However, our world is sometimes driven by the vocal minority and in this case it will be the luddites that VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE self-driving cars for short minded purposes.<p>Growing up in Nebraska and witnessing the reaction to technological influence there was very eye opening in that you realize that the common man/women thinks very much with their emotions and not with logic. You can beat them over the head with facts like this and they will argue for their old ways. They want to be in control of the situation. They want to have the right to drive their car themselves and they certainly don&#x27;t trust a machine to do it for them. (I guarantee that you will hear arguements like &quot;it&#x27;s taking away jobs&quot; and &quot;look at this instance where it malfunctioned&quot;)  this leaves some very tricky features that engineers must work into it. Is there a manual override?  Are there regulations on what kind of sensing equipment is on board or is it left to the private company?  What is the acceptable error range for a car at the end of the day?<p>I think we will move into a world dominated by self-driving cars and other tech conviences that make our life easier, but I think it will be slowed down considerably by those who are resistant to change.

The Mughal Empire allowed Clive to set up a free trade zone with a land grant of a swamp that eventually became Calcutta, and the East India Company built a wall, and started trading on the pound (Â£). It&#x27;s amazing what happens once you stop trading with unstable currencies. Growth and prosperity. The Mughal empire, which was on the verge, essentially collapsed over the next few years (post &#x27;57 -- mostly through the 60s and 70s) as the merchant classes just shifted to doing business in Calcutta.<p>--> I wrote my undergraduate thesis about this topic, and spent a year at the British Library reading first-hand accounts from both sides, focusing on the resulting Anglo-Indian legal system set in place by Sir Robert Chambers.

The extremists. They adopt the SJW ideology and wrap themselves up in it like a warm blanket. I think that &#x27;slur&#x27; would refer to those extreme individuals. An example of someone taking it to the extreme would be someone frothing at the mouth because you said the word &quot;spider&quot;. They&#x27;re angry, upset and offended because they&#x27;re scared of spiders and you didn&#x27;t put a trigger warning in front of it (Yes, those people really exist). They&#x27;re hypersensitive and find everything and anything offensive for the sake of being offended because their outrage nets them a form of attention.<p>On every side of every issue, you&#x27;re going to have extremists. I think it&#x27;s best to stomp out extremism when you come across it because they inevitably do more harm to their cause then good.<p>This is actually a great write-up on the trigger-warning phenomena:<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-j-rosendall/trigger-warnings-and-twit_b_6733962.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-j-rosendall/trigger-wa...</a><p>Quote from the article: &quot;<i>I believe the current P.C. agenda, by demanding purity from its allies, is showcasing its inherent weakness.&quot; She is right.

The people in question aren&#x27;t what I have a problem with, only the language and behavior that contributes to social norms in some communities on the Internet that are exclusionary of women, people of color, and LGBTQ folks.<p>The only thing I said that was about people was &quot;mostly said by angry young white dudes on the Internet&quot;. Which was, in fact, intended to be dismissive of some people&#x27;s words. I believe it is a boringly predictable and reactionary display of privilege that deserves nothing other than to be dismissed. It is not merely coincidence that it is almost universally angry young white men who make these kinds of statements.",1425535368
9149496,comment,9143814,9147657,0,0,ptaipale,,,"Well, in Baltic states, there <i>is</i> the cultural gap between Russians and ethnic Estonians, Latvians and Litthuanians in each of the states, respectively. It is not a small one. There are still lots of people who are resident in e.g. Estonia, and were born there, but have no citizenship because they do not (can not, will not) pass the citizenship language test.<p>The difference to Ukraine is that the Baltic nations grew strong enough already during the final decades of Soviet Union, and they still remembered their pre-war independence.<p>In 1959, the population of Estonia was roughly the same as in 1939. The difference was that almost a third had been replaced by Russians.<p>Ethnic Estonians had been first purged by USSR in 1939-1941, then killed by war going back and forth over the country in 1941-1944, and then purged again by Stalin&#x27;s further repressions until 1950&#x27;s, by moving people to camps all over the Gulag and killing them there. After that, there was a bit of dual existence, and &quot;Druzhby narodov nadozhnyy oplot!&quot; was rather a less reliable bulwark of friendship than the song was saying.<p>Then, in 1991, came the singing revolution. After that, many Estonians have migrated to Finland, Sweden, Germany, and other countries, but they send money back home. In exchange, Estonians get guest workers from Russia or Belarus in the same way. Still, it&#x27;s not that easy for Estonians, as for instance trained doctors and nurses often leave the country after their training.<p>Ukraine, in contrast, was run by various Russian cronies - the Orange revolution could not build nation -and has had endemic corruption all the time.<p>What you say about poor nations having bad choices is right as you either leak population or you build a police state that tries to restrain population. Education and eradication of corruption will help, but it&#x27;s very slow work. I think the Baltic states are showing the way there.",1425535331

So hopefully my ideas count as semi-insightful :)<p>I could see this being adopted by university professors in certain circumstances - but the idea of shelling out for it will definitely put them off  (trust me - our lecturers claimed for EVERYTHING :D). Plus many universities already have custom portal software that the lecturers have to use (for whatever reason: usually in case of disputes etc.).<p>Same probably applies to (UK) secondary school (US = high school) level teachers (i.e. they wont want to pay). BUT in their case getting the school to pay for it on ""expenses"" would be next to impossible (budgets are super tight atm). As I see it this is probably your target market (definitely in the UK anyway) so if you can market it to the <i>schools</i> themselves you might have more success.<p>Some ideas for you (I apologise I only briefly scanned your app so they could be in place already :) plus some of this is relevant to UK schools and I have no idea how it works in the US - though I would bet it is similar). This also assumes your interested in grouping teachers by school :)<p>Firstly <i>allow collaboration</i>. In schools usually assignments are designed by one or more subject heads/organisers. If you let said co-ordinator upload all the assignments to somewhere all of the subject teachers can access and send them out to their students this would probably get you a lot of interest. Mostly because if the teachers / subject heads change the historical data is already there to make use of :)<p>One other idea is to allow some kind of grouping of gradings for a specific email address. One of a teachers BIGGEST gripes is collating reports for their students. If they could see all the awarded grades by subject in one click I bet you would get piles of ""we love you"" email.<p>But yes: the main way I see of selling this is pitching it as a ""whole school"" thing.

I believe you mean to say, ""pretending that the markets we have now are free is a chump's game.""  Is this the sort of hypothetical story that you have in mind:<p>""Joe the programmer has gotten laid off from three companies that ended up going out of business while watching insurance giants and bankers get bailed out by the government, seeing people in licensed professions (lawyers, doctors, nurses) remain secure in their lucrative jobs, and observing that government employees never get fired, have great benefits, high pay, and low levels of work and stress.""<p>If so, you can make a case that Joe is a chump.  You could argue that he should be using force to get a better deal at the expense of others rather than naïvely working to increase total wealth.  But in any case, the problem has to do with the breakdown of the rule of law, disregard for property rights, and neglecting to observe the hidden costs.  Free markets have nothing to do with this.<p><i>Yes, allow talented workers to come here.

How would America be any better if Sergey Brin's father had been one of those marginal cases you had decided to keep out?  It's easy to forget that if we keep out X Indian individuals, some Y of those individuals might go on to build the next Cisco -- and if they're excluded from America, that company might be built in India.

679256,comment,678985,678985,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Good article, but the author uses a few logical fallacies, and ignores some inconvenient facts, to prove his point.<p>----<p>Firstly, on the Great Depression in 1933<p>The Great Depression did not threaten or undermine ""...the male breadwinner model of the family..."" economic model.  It undermined the ANY breadwinner of the family economic model.  The author falls into an intellectual trap that many of us fall into from time to time.  We equate the  suffering of the day to some well known hardship of the past.  However, the reason that the hardship of the past is so well known is because it was a hardship greater than any that had come before it, or since.  Subsequent generations have found it to stand the test of time, and our posterity are likely to find it to stand the test of time as well.  Apart from the fact that statistics were calculated differently back then, so that 25% Great Depression unemployment rate means nothing in our terms, there was much less to go around to start with.  So while I was not there, I have very little doubt that the situation today would have to deteriorate a good deal before we could say we went through anything approaching the level of deprivation that the Greatest Generation lived through.  And, believe me, that is true whether you are a man or a woman, black, white or polka dot purple.<p>----<p>Secondly, just a pet peeve of mine.  We have a tendency to create bubbles to drive our economy.  The bubble I see forming right now is in the health care industry.  For instance, because of the overbuilding of hospitals, we are already beginning to see the start of the health care bubble bursting.  In Houston, I know of several hospitals that have laid off large numbers of workers.  In addition to entire new hospitals being moth balled.  Yes, that's right, I mean there are buildings that cost between US$300 and US$800 million to build.  They were completed recently in Houston's Medical center area.  And, yes, they are sitting empty with no people in them.  Bing or Google Baylor College of Medicine if you want an example.<p>Houston is not the only place this has happened, or will happen.  Many cities seem to want to replace their jobs base with jobs that cannot be outsourced, and are well paying.  Jobs in female dominated fields like, say, nursing.  However, this just sets up another bubble.  Like in Houston, most of these facilities are financed through bond issues or philanthropy.  Both of which are drying up at a fairly fast clip right now.  Which is why the government is so anxious to throw money into health care.  The bubble is beginning to pop, hospitals are mothballed, and a lot of the people in those female dominated fields are starting to be laid off.<p>A lot of it is just plain old overbuilding.  I've personally done a good deal of number crunching on the national level in this field.  Take an analysis of Cleveland health care market for instance.  Total patients required to be served in the strategic plans of Cleveland's hospitals: ~250,000.  Population of Cleveland: ~500,000.  Now to be fair, Cleveland Clinic expects to pull a large population from outside the area, but that population is only so large.  And it is impacted by the fact that all of the other cities in the country are trying to do the same thing.  Similar story all over the country, obviously Houston, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, deep south, west, everywhere.<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg.  Don't even get me started on the outlooks for bio sciences, pharmaceuticals and nano tech.  Suffice it to say that I believe the coming right sizing of these industries will be fairly violent.  I could be wrong however, the government is trying to pump a lot of money into them.  That doesn't make these entities economically viable however, it just means they will have guaranteed access to finance as long as the government can afford it.<p>Anyway, I think it morally unconscionable to be encouraging women to go into these fields when we have numbers right now pointing to the likelihood of non trivial layoffs in the near future.  It is akin to having encouraged homeownership when it was clear that stormclouds were forming.<p>----<p>Lastly, the author seems to fall victim to the Fallacy of the Excluded Middle.  <<See Wikipedia for a definition of that logical fallacy>>.  The author asserts that men have only 2 options, go with the flow, let the woman be the breadwinner and do more house work.  Or fight the changes that the author assumes the men don't like.  I won't get into why I believe neither of these methods would work very well.  I mean really, a single income in this economy?  But how about the men consider getting a job as a teacher AND doing a little housework?  Just because you are the breadwinner, I don't see any reason you can't do laundry every now and again.",1246295176

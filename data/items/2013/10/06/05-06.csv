We can put that aside for now--if you are a competent coder, you are in high demand...<p>If you want to have more math, then some subfield in CS theory is the way to go.\nCS theory have lot of elegant math. complexity, data structure, algorithms, combinatorial optimization, computational geometry. All of them have nice set of mathematical tools you can use. There are also unexpected ones that uses more traditional mathematics, like universal algebra for CSP, functional analysis in graph embedding with little distortion, and topology for computational topology(well that seems obvious, there are certain uses for computational topology, read up on persistent topology, which I guess is part of machine learning now).<p>Of course, the demands are low for pure theory students. However you can do some practical work. For example <a href=""http://www.tokutek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tokutek.com/</a> , founded by professors who specialize in cache oblivious data structures. Some more practical ones include cache oblivious data structures, sublinear time algorithms, string related algorithms. In Google, there are researchers working on how to optimize ads.<p>Also, I just don&#x27;t see how you are going to write non-boilerplate code anywhere. everything eventually become repetitive(unless you use Haskell, anything new become a paper.)",1381039168

6503296,comment,6502721,6502872,1,0,Mqlpidrien,,,"If I read the description of the wikipedia article, I could easily think that I suffer from ADHD. To me it feels a little bit like asperger syndrome where you can pick and choose related syndrome and believe you might suffer from it when you are just a little bit asocial. To exaggerate, it is like reading an horoscope and thinking that, woah, it is exactly how you are or how this person is.<p>Obviously there are trained doctors and psychiatrist and whoever who can judge whether or not a kid suffer from adhd but it seems that it will be way more than 7% of kid that could get bored by tasks they are being test for and that is why adhd seen from outside the usa feels too often diagnosed.<p>Others have said how the drug would have helped themselves or is helping themselves but has it been shown that the drug would not help everyone who takes it to focus and perform better at test and studying or working. \nSince I live in the USA, I have asked the questions to college student and it seems a fairly common thing to take a pill before exam to get that extra edge for focus (granted you don&#x27;t start cleaning your apartment and become very thorough while doing it).<p>Even if the drug could help some people, it is not unreasonable to consider whether introducing the drug to society has an overall benefit and not just a benefit to the company selling it. France has already a problem with to many prescriptions of anti depressor drugs so maybe it is not a good idea to jump on adhd pills.",1381038868
6503295,comment,6501769,6502309,5,0,evincarofautumn,,,"It’s very much a work in progress, but yes, as far as the language design goes. Right now there’s a horrifically inefficient AST-walking interpreter, essentially the simplest thing that can possibly work. That gives us integration tests, a standard library, and a REPL. We are working on the design and implementation of a native runtime as free time allows.<p>The language looks and feels fairly high level, like a hybrid imperative-functional language. But in reality, it’s closer to (stack machine) assembly. There is a relatively straightforward mapping to x86 or ARM, so it’s easy to look at some code and mentally compile it at -O0 the way you might in C. Each Kitten instruction usually corresponds to one or two x86 instructions.<p>Evaluation is strict, because excessive laziness can negatively impact predictability and performance, and you can get many of the benefits of laziness in different ways. All types have immutable value semantics; sharing is essentially an optimisation, and can be implemented with a tracing GC <i>or</i> a reference-counting one because the language is cycle-free. And function definitions are often <i>extremely</i> short, so they benefit from aggressive inlining.<p>The general feeling is that we want absolutely as lightweight a runtime as possible—no type tagging, value boxing, runtime dispatch, reflection, garbage collection, &c. unless the programmer asks for them. At the same time, we want to avoid infecting code with low-level details such as pointers, lifetimes, and ownership. Correctness first, followed shortly by performance.<p>Kitten is attacking the same problems as Rust and Nimrod, but from a very different direction. And of course we are only a small handful of people working in our spare time, and I write most of the code. It would be wonderful to have some more people on board.",1381038867

Algorithms or theory or programming languages, lots of discrete math, logics, algebraic structures, etc. Of course it&#x27;s good to get a good grasp of the basics of all these, since they&#x27;re definitely not exclusive, and which you&#x27;ll get from your degree, and beyond that, well explore, and enjoy!!

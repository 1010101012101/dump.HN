Sophisticated pirates are needed to break DRM. Unsophisticated ones get it from them without any hassle.

7744974,comment,7739378,7742569,1,0,gcd,,,"> The upper level courses, even at the undergraduate level ... are usually being taught by people who have made it their entire life&#x27;s work to study that field, and at that level of University are often some of the best people in that field. That kind of perspective, depth of knowledge, and passion don&#x27;t necessarily translate well to teaching (I can think of some math professors that I had...), but it often does<p>I personally don&#x27;t see why &#x27;often does&#x27; would be the case, at least in technical fields. I&#x27;m also thinking about graduate student instructors (GSIs), the ones who taught discussions. Few were genuinely good at teaching the material either - I always had to &#x27;shop around&#x27; to find the few who were capable of explaining the material properly. All of them were very smart, but I think that it was often a drawback because they often seemed unable to empathize with not quickly developing an understanding of the material. Others simply weren&#x27;t interested in teaching or at least didn&#x27;t seem interested. There were, though, a couple that were both brilliant and seemed to genuinely think and care about teaching. This paralleled my experience with professors.<p>I was actually talking with my girlfriend about this because she thought she had a lot of good / great professors during her time at Cal. However, she was also in the social science realm. I have two very rough hypotheses to try and explain this difference:<p>One, I think that it <i>might</i> have something to do with the fact that most of my professors were originally from countries other than the US. Accents were never a problem, but I would guess that when it came to explaining more difficult concepts, there may have been some gaps in communication.<p>Two, more importantly, I think that the research done in computer science attracts a different kind of person than research in the social sciences. My girlfriend noted that much of the research that her professors were doing necessarily involved a lot of human interaction that extended beyond the academic sphere. On the other hand, I&#x27;m guessing that CS research is a lot more insulated, which may result in worse communication skills.<p>> even if it doesn&#x27;t those professors are usually /amazing/ resources outside of class if you want to know more about (subject of choice), what the current problems in that field are, what&#x27;s considered important or valuable, etc.<p>Again, this isn&#x27;t helpful when it comes to actually learning the course material. If you want to do research, this is great. But I&#x27;m talking exclusively about the undergraduate educational experience.<p>> I&#x27;d hesitate to make sweeping generalizations, but I think that if you didn&#x27;t manage to take as many advanced courses (particularly graduate ones. Good undergrads at institutions like that can almost always handle the graduate courses they offer after they have the sufficient background) with as many top people in a field (or fields) as possible, you wasted an opportunity if you were at a school like that.<p>I took 6 upper division CS undergraduate courses + 1 graduate CS course. Most graduate classes were only for graduate students or, if anything, took only A+ / 4.0GPA undergrads, at least in the few fields I was interested in.",1400089117

In one case, this effort included <i>updating every television in the nation</i>. Yet still, five years after the digital transition, from the WIA Spectrum Policy [0] page:<p><i>Rural areas continue to be the most underserved market in terms of wireless reach and innovation. However, the abundance of white spaces in these regions provides a unique opportunity for rural wireless providers to use this unused spectrum to promote coverage through high-capacity service. While the advantages to expanding this expansion remain undisputed, firm action has not been taken as of yet in order to allow the operation of higher powered spectrum in these areas. At present, TV band devices are not permitted to operate at power levels greater than 4 watts EIRP, even though expanding this power limit would pose virtually no threat of interference to current broadcast bands. The delay in the advance of power limits only serves to hinder wireless progress in rural areas of the country.</i><p>That seems wasteful: usable white space was one of the selling points of the digital transition, and yet giant blocks remain unusable for no publicly-acknowledged reason. I mean, I hesitate to even ask what the military are doing with all their spectrum while this is still going on.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wirelessinnovationalliance.org/index.cfm?objectid=1B229210-71B3-11E0-83F3000C296BA163"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wirelessinnovationalliance.org/index.cfm?objectid...</a>",1400088511

It&#x27;s now only a matter of time before images, CSS, JavaScript, hell, even the text, are delivered through OS-specific, locked down CDMs. It will start with pissant sites nobody cares about (like the ones who are currently fighting AdBlock), but eventually a large site will demand it - most users will be using a device that handles this, and we will literally never have the Open Web ever again.

With Mithril, the diffing algorithm is basically a recursive tree diff. In addition to diffing at the attribute level (and taking care of some broken edge cases), it can do things like detect parent changes and reattach unmodified trees to new parents, if needed. I generally don&#x27;t like corner-case-specific optimizations because I believe there are better directions to explore in order to improve performance (Mithril has a concept called SubtreeDirectives that I&#x27;m planning to expand on, for example). At the end of the day, one has to ask themselves if loading and parsing code to handle a bazillion rare corner cases is really significantly better than just doing the naive thing. The benchmark on the Mithril homepage seems to suggest that being minimalist performs better at the worst and arguably most important case (the first render).<p>Mithril in its entirety (with router, promises, ajax, etc) is ~500 lines of code (vs Bloop&#x27;s 250) and the diff implementation has gotten more and more robust over the course of v0.1.* thanks to the Mithril community. I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong, but I&#x27;m seriously doubtful you can get a better balance between leanness and robustness elsewhere.<p>Re: best way to structure apps: I just posted an article ( <a href=""http://lhorie.github.io/mithril-blog/an-exercise-in-awesomeness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lhorie.github.io/mithril-blog/an-exercise-in-awesomen...</a> ) that ports some of the examples in this article over to Mithril to see how the two compared. My conclusion was that it&#x27;s definitely possible to structure apps in a React-like style with Mithril. There a lot of benefits that this structure brings to the table, and using well understood design patterns effectively can go a long way to complement the componentization paradigm.<p>I don&#x27;t force any particular implementation of the MVC pattern with Mithril, but I try to always organize code following the classic MVC pattern in my own code. My blog is partly an effort to document the techniques that can be used to support a liberal MVC pattern without necessarily committing to React&#x27;s OOP paradigm or whatever.",1400087681

You can&#x27;t use the itunes subscription SKU functionality to delivery your subscription content (obviously, I hope).<p>You should also consider joining the Enterprise app developer program that Apple offers if you want to by pass some of the above issues.<p>Not to be overly pointed, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like you have done much homework here.  I recommend you get more familiar with the market you&#x27;re about to enter.",1400086926

Even if only adhered to leniently, a bias against gluten has been a great help in reducing the quantity of processed food I consume, the benefit of which I don’t think anyone currently denies.",1400086910

We still want to support them.<p>It is against our philosophy to bend the purity of our API to accommodate wrinkles in how outdated infrastructure declines to support standards. There will be no JSONP alternative to CORS in RunOrg.<p>The solution we propose each and every time is to mount a proxy to our API on the same domain as the site it is used on. Users on modern infrastructure reach us directly at api.runorg.com, users on CORS-hostile infrastructure reach us through the proxy and still get their data (albeit with decreased performance). It&#x27;s a fairly simple technical solution that leavers our API clean and supports non-CORS modes of access.",1400086885

Growing up in a different country I don&#x27;t remember _ever_ hearing about this.

And now we&#x27;ve evolved this strange sensitivity to it. So the idea is that it is these FODMAPs. Do we today end up eating more products with FODMAPs while before when baking bread it just didn&#x27;t have that many of those?<p>I feel the same is happening with allergies. I don&#x27;t remember hearing much about allergies. I only knew one kid in my high-school who had asthma. But now I know a lot of people in this country that are allergic to all kind of things.

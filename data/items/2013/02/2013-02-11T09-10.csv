Excel actually has a lot of features for preventing issues such as formula debugging, input validation and named ranges that make formulas more readable, but the UI is terrible and it's not very discoverable. The problem with Excel seems to be primarily that the MS desktop monopoly made it very hard for people to market better UIs for the ""quick financial model"" use case. The only way around that was either in B2B sales (where the economics forced you into building big ERP systems where management locked down the processes) or over the web, where we've had to wait for browser technology to reach a sufficient level of power before such a system could be built. I think since IE9, we're now at that point.

    *Binstock:* Still, you can't argue with the Web's success.

    *Kay:* I think you can.

    *Binstock:* Well, look at Wikipedia  it's a tremendous collaboration.

    *Kay:* It is, but go to the article on Logo, can you write and execute Logo programs? 
    Are there examples? No. The Wikipedia people didn't even imagine that, in spite of the 
    fact that they're on a computer. That's why I never use PowerPoint. PowerPoint is just 
    simulated acetate overhead slides, and to me, that is a kind of a moral crime. That's 
    why I always do, not just dynamic stuff when I give a talk, but I do stuff that I'm 
    interacting with on-the-fly. Because that is what the computer is for. People who 
    don't do that either don't understand that or don't respect it.

    The marketing people are not there to teach people, so probably one of the most 
    disastrous interactions with computing was the fact that you could make money selling 
    simulations of old, familiar media, and these apps just swamped most of the ideas of 
    Doug Engelbart, for example. The Web browser, for many, many years, and still, even 
    though it's running on a computer that can do X, Y, and Z, it's now up to about X and 
    1/2 of Y.

5200061,comment,5198750,5199835,3,0,waterhouse,,,"Guy says he made an audio engine, graphics engine, game engine, and so on.<p>In order for these to be useful for a serious, high-quality product, there must be no perceptible pauses induced by garbage collection.<p>An audio engine in particular seems to need to run extremely quickly--on Mac OS X, at any rate.  Perform this experiment: Pick your favorite music player, such as iTunes, play your favorite song, and run this:<p><pre><code>  $ for ((;;)); do killall -STOP iTunes; sleep .008; killall -CONT iTunes; sleep .050; done
</code></pre>
This simulates 8-millisecond GC pauses.  On my fairly fast, modern laptop, this is too much--I hear a bunch of stuttering in the audio.  (It's kind of surreal.)  I have to cut the pauses down to 5 milliseconds to completely avoid stuttering.  This goes for every program that produces audio output that I've tested.  It is possible that audio output under other operating systems is handled differently, and that you could install a buffer of sound output for the next 50 or 100 milliseconds or whatever [it may even be possible to do that on OS X--I don't know], but I'm not betting on it.  ... Besides audio, usually games want to maintain a certain refresh rate, such as 30 or 60 frames per second.  30 fps is 33 milliseconds per frame.  If a pause lasts any longer (in fact, if the pause lasts [33 msec - <time to compute and draw the next frame>]), the drawing will stutter.  Maybe you might think, ""Eh, who cares?  It's just a little stutter from time to time.""  If I've read this guy right, this is exactly the sort of thing he would not tolerate.<p>In order for such an audio library to be writable in Common Lisp, Common Lisp compilers/runtime systems will have to get their act together and ensure that the maximum GC pause time is less than 5 milliseconds on my machine, no matter how many objects are allocated by the program using the library.<p>In the absence of Common Lisp compilers/runtimes that can do this, there are two choices: write it in a different language, such as C or C++ with manual memory management; or write your own Common Lisp runtime + compiler that can.<p>I have gone down the latter rabbit hole.

For better or worse, one of the lessons of programming is the unforgiving nature of the computer to do exactly what you typed in, and not what you meant. I remember having a similar test or quiz to this when I was in high school (~12 years ago or so). Its not that big of a deal, the whole class is not just that, its just to kind of drill this into your head. We were using pretty terrible Borland compilers with rubbish error messages. At that particular point, being able to stare at code and determine what minor thing you mistyped was unfortunately a crucial skill.  Again, this is arguably less important today (and arguably <i>all</i> written tests are bad for CS).<p>Later in college, I remember hating the assembly tests where you had to keep track of what numbers were in what address, and whether you were adding what was on the stack or in some register or the address or what was in the address and making a mistake in the very beginning could ruin the whole problem.

And so on, close to 15:00 file was supposed to be ready to send to the management. Sometimes it took till 20:00 (hours after 16:00 wasn't paid). When somebody important was on leave, nobody knew how to fill the details.<p>That spreadsheets had almost no formulas in them, cause people ""cut and pasted as values"" all data after calculating it (my wife was told it's to ""protect the data from accidential changes""). I think it was to prevent people from seeing the errors.<p>Everybody knew that the data is all wrong. Nobody knew how to even get the correct input for most fields, it was all fuzzy (for example - one person in production knew which labels are bought in 100s, 500s, 1000s, etc. He was sent the file to fill that details, nobody could check that, and there was always some contradictions in the last pages of the spreadsheet. Most of the work went into massaging it untill it seemed OK. The file also crashed half the time, even on computers with 4GB of ram and 64bit windows.<p>I wonder, how they managed to stay in business (they are still around, and have quite big marketshare).",1360574377

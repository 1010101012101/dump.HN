The whole concept of the &quot;lemon&quot; is one that ignores that a machine like this is the sum of it&#x27;s parts, in their working or non working order.<p>In the auto world, some states have odd qualifiers like &quot;3 times in X months = you bought a lemon&quot;, which in reality means, &quot;I did not know enough about the individual parts of the machine I purchased to fairly assess their quality/condition/or appropriate place in the larger machine&quot;.<p>I can understand this, in the automotive world, as these machines are in fact quite complicated.  A bicycle is not.  The most complicated bicycles on the market may be, with electronic shifting, etc.. but those come at such a premium they&#x27;re legitimately intended for racing users only.  If you can&#x27;t spend a few minutes to see how simple moving parts should work, take care of exposed parts in the elements, and educate yourself, how dare you compare your simplistic, cheap machine to a car legally.<p>We have enough problems trying to ride our bicycles without people trying to act like lawyers when they don&#x27;t know how to clean their front derailleurs.",1428029273

9314225,comment,9278524,9308779,0,0,weavejester,,,"My definition of macro would be: a function that&#x27;s evaluated at compile time.<p>In this sense, the idea of an &quot;expression-macro&quot; and a &quot;pattern-macro&quot; makes as much sense as an &quot;expression-function&quot; or &quot;pattern-function&quot;. We don&#x27;t typically have different classes of function to fulfil different purposes.<p>The `if-match` macro you describe could be written as a function, albeit with less pleasing syntax:<p><pre><code>    (defn if-match [pat expr then else]
      (if-let [match (if (fn? pat) (pat expr) (isa? pat expr)]
        (then match)
        (else match)))

    (if-match 0 0 (fn [_] true) (fn [_] false))

    (if-match (pattern/cons 0 &#x27;x)
              &#x27;(0 hi there)
              (fn [{:syms [x]}] x)
              (fn [_] nil))
</code></pre>
So in the above case, we allow literal values to be passed in, or a function which returns a map of symbols to matching values. It&#x27;s the function that allows for the extensibility.<p>A macro can easily smooth over the janky syntax of the `then` and `else` functions, and we&#x27;d end up something like this:<p><pre><code>    (if-match (pattern/cons 0 x)
              &#x27;(0 hi there)
              x
              nil)
</code></pre>
This is essentially what my previous example was alluding to, though in that I intended to use a namespaced macro rather than a namespaced function for extensibility.<p>You might well complain that `(pattern/cons 0 x)` is more verbose than `(cons 0 x)`, but it&#x27;s also unambiguous, and doesn&#x27;t require what would amount to a separate namespacing system, which a Lisp-1 like Clojure tends to reject.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think the above examples are magical in any way. The macro is a small improvement over the function, and the function isn&#x27;t particularly complex. If higher-order functions are your idea of wizardry, then there&#x27;s not much in Lisp that you <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> consider magic.<p>Maybe your objection just stems from the use of something like `p/cons` instead of just `cons`, while still desiring `cons` to be namespaced in some way. In which case, I&#x27;d suggest that what you&#x27;re really asking is not &#x27;can I have expression-macros and pattern-macros&#x27;, but &#x27;can I create new namespacing systems&#x27;.",1428029221

Many months of math takes time away from other CS parts. He writes that maths helps you get better at abstract thinking, which I agree with, but he don&#x27;t compare to other CS areas. For example, if studying compilers or data strcutures help you think abstract then we can perhaps have a compiler/data structure course instead of a math course. This would help students learn both abstract thinking and something directly CS related. 
I think we can all agree that having only math for four years would make great abstract thinkers but probably very bad developers.",1428029008

  If the twin prime conjecture is correct, then we may conclude that the
  [primes] are not constructed randomly&quot; 
</code></pre>
why does he say a random distribution of primes would imply the twin prime conjecture is false?<p>My intuition is the opposite: a random distribution of primes implies the twin prime conjecture is true.  Because suppose there are finite twin primes, set them aside; then test pairs of numbers above the largest of them.  Since we assume the twin prime conjecture is false, the chances that random pairs above that number are both prime is exacty 0; but that would mean the primes are <i>not</i> distributed randomly...",1428027415

The problem is that with this round total raised is $100M. VC&#x27;s expect to double or triple their money, as par.  That sets a simplified expected exit valuation of $300M for this to be a success. Ticketmaster was last sold for $400MM in 2009.  The bar for success is now extremely high.

I still think TFF&#x27;s stance on the rape joke drama is that the jokes shouldn&#x27;t have been made in the first place, and that PA can&#x27;t close them off from criticism if they want to call themselves legitimate satire.<p>My take: this was the single best description that I have ever seen anywhere of how at least one type of &quot;geek&quot; is made - forged by constant early-life bullying and deprivation of a social life, sexuality, and belonging.

Their value-add is streamlined APIs and tailored customer service. That value-add is nice but relatively smaller and less scalable to boot.

So, if you use the same ratio of transaction volume to revenue (0.16%) that would put Square&#x27;s revenue at $23.2mln. For what it&#x27;s worth, that&#x27;s probably a generous ratio, as companies like Square and Braintree are all use Chase payments tech as their processor, which itself has to pay out to Visa and other processors.

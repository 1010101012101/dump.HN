4187051,comment,4186731,4186987,10,0,reitzensteinm,,,"SIMD instructions are used to explicitly execute vector operations in parallel. The patent is about rearranging a stream of instructions across a loop at runtime to turn code that was not written with SIMD in mind into parallel code.<p>The across the loop part is the vaguely new part of it. To simplify it greatly, this can already be made parallel at runtime:<p><pre><code>  float a = 5.0;
  float b = 10.0;
  
  //The next two lines are executed in one clock tick
  a*=2;
  b*=2;
</code></pre>
This patent deals with a method to turn this into parallel code:<p><pre><code>  float[] vals = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 }
  
  for ( int i = 0; i < vals.length; i++ ) {
    
    vals[ i ] *= 2;

  }
</code></pre>
Obviously it has to detect any data dependencies at runtime, which isn't trivial. This can't be rewritten, for instance, because i depends on i - 1:<p><pre><code>  float[] vals = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 }
  
  for ( int i = 1; i < vals.length; i++ ) {
    
    vals[ i ] *= vals[ i - 1 ];
  
  }
</code></pre>
Now, this is cool. I'd love to be working on stuff like this. But it's an extremely obvious step, once you've cleared the low hanging fruit. It's just that the extra complexity hasn't been worth it until now, because easier and simpler things to do have given enough speed up. That someone would do this was <i>inevitable</i>, which is why I say the patent is ridiculous.<p>Imagine history turning out completely differently. IBM is the largest CPU design firm in the world, after Shockley Semiconductor and HP who fab chips for the latest Commodore machine. Apple and Dell never existed. Every single person working on CPU design today for whatever reason ended up in another field.<p>We would still be seeing this technique first being used at the 1 billion transistor mark for CPUs. It's just a consequence of the nature of computation.",1341197186

4187033,comment,4186927,4186927,24,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Ignoring the crop subsidies for a moment, there was a similar issue in the US for many years. In the little farming town where I grew up, there was a giant mountain of grain dumped outside of town where excess grain was left to rot (and like the article stated, it reeks).<p>People often wonder why excess grain is dumped instead of shipped off as aid to people that can't afford it. The reason is simple but complex in its implications: the grain is worth less than the cost to move it somewhere else. In addition to the loss of underutilized grain, someone has to pay even more money to move it that in the net is not a cost efficient way to get food to the people that need it relative to not using dumped grain. So the grain is dumped.<p>One way to improve the situation is to invest in infrastructure to reduce the logistical cost, allowing the grain to compete across a wider range of market prices. However, that investment in infrastructure has to be offset by return on the grain production it effectively allows and has to account for the unpredictability of a global market that the subsidies are crudely trying to mitigate. There is a diminishing return.<p>One of the big issues in the global market is that grain trade tends to be highly protectionist, in part for food security reasons. While some countries (like the US) produce grain in vast quantities at low cost, most governments do not want to be dependent on foreign countries for their food. At the same time, these policies increase the price and restrict flow of food in these countries in times when the global market is a much more efficient producer. Subsidies and protectionism tend to be very blunt instruments.",1341196987

Not sure if I'd argue that, but it's clearer to argue that specific schools of art meet that definition.  e.g. I don't think anyone will surpass Bach in organ music.<p>Modern European culture isn't the part that's dead, it's that there are also ""dead"" cultural artifacts in Europe, while the US was basically a clean slate.  That's a plus for Europe in some ways, but in some ways actually helps the US -- having to create everything from scratch, taking the best (well, maybe) of other cultures, is itself interesting.

4186970,comment,4186373,4186660,6,0,einhverfr,,,"I am an American living in Indonesia at the moment.<p>A lot of this is complicated.  The US, as the only superpower (financial, cultural, and military) is not just one country among many.  What happens in the US affects every corner of the planet.  I am living right now in Indonesia and I see that every day.  There are other countries which this can be said for, but they all are oil exporters and their impact is solely a function of those oil exports.<p>At the same time, I find a lot of Americans seem to think the other countries don't matter as much as they do.  Consequently we have these bizarre discussions of how anti-American one country or another is, and, absent them calling America the great Satan or the like, one wonders how much of it is being intolerant of a level of dissent in foreign countries that would be perfectly allowed at home.<p>So the truth is very often more complicated than simple dichotomies.<p>The exception is that I would agree with #4.  The US has a number of huge looming challenges which affect our country in a way no other country is affected.  These include what I call ""peak oil"" (see below, not quite what peak oil theorists mean), the baby boomer retirement (this affects us differently than China or Japan, but Europe is going to feel the effects too), and a need to repair/replace much of our existing infrastructure.  The infrastructure disrepair is becoming evident now, but I want to spend more time on the others.<p>Peak oil is usually defined as an absolute peak in production, after which production cannot rise to the same level.  This is not what I mean.  Instead I mean peak production relative to demand.  We passed this peak in 1973 and after the oil crisis, oil supply never continued to grow in the way it grew prior to 1973.  The crisis itself may have been political and the peak may be economic, but that doesn't make it any less real.  Since 1973, oil production has gone up and down, but never continued to grow steadily as it had in the past.<p>Oil makes our economy work because it is a cheap source of energy.  Unconventional hydrocarbons can help there, but they take much more energy to extract, and thus when energy is the limiting principle of your economy (and thus the primary cost), these are only profitable at high oil prices.  Unconventional hydrocarbons thus act as a cushion against the sort of drastic decline we might see if we were only looking at light sweet crude.  They are not a perfect substitute.  And so I predict that oil production to the extent it increases, will not do so as fast as demand, and thus energy prices will continue to rise.  The key driver of this demand is economic development in China, Brazil, India, and other countries.  And thus any increase in production will not cause a collapse in oil or energy prices.  Also note that most renewable energy has a comparatively low energy return on investment and so they are only really profitable when oil prices are high also, so they too act as a cushion.  A transition from stored solar energy (fossil fuels) to current solar energy will not be economically pleasant.<p>The problem here is that higher energy prices, particularly oil prices, puts the brakes on all aspects of the economy and the US is particularly vulnerable.  The US may already be past peak oil consumption as oil consumption has been falling off in recent years (how much is due to the Great Recession is hard to know however).<p>Retirement also affects different places differently.  Europe and the US are likely to be hardest hit by the baby boom retiring, but the US is particularly vulnerable.  In most countries in the world, retirement is not expected to be independent.  When you retire, you move in with your kids, and help them raise their kids.  They pay for your medical bills, and feed you, and you help them out as you can.  In Europe and the US this is different.  The expectation that we will have independent retirement means we have to save up vast amounts of money for that, and we also have to have programs like Medicare to provide the costs for caring for the elderly.  However, the US is uniquely bad at cost control.  Our public sector pays more per capita on medical care than any other country in the world and that's just the public sector (Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, and state/federal gov. insurance pools).  We can't control costs there and so the costs will be truly hard to bear.  Entirely missing in the health care reform debate has been this incompetence of the federal government to control costs in any way.<p>The US has one significant advantage in all this but it is one that could go away suddenly and leave us stranded.  The USD is the world's reserve currency.  This means that the national debt can be eased by the US essentially printing money to get out of debt.  However, if that changes, the US access to international credit will suddenly be very different and our debt will become difficult to sustain.  Right now we are lucky because there are no real alternatives.  The Euro was looking good for a while, but not anymore.....<p>tl; dr:  The US has a number of significant and unique challenges which will erode our presence in the world over coming decades.  How much erosion we suffer will depend on a lot of factors however.",1341195915

I've been able to build a profitable startup with 100k+ users and am now working on my next thing.<p>Firstly, your age won't stop you raising money. Believe me, it's a huge bonus IF you're ready and serious. But if you want to start a company it has to be something you dedicate all your time to and spend years building. VC's invest because they expect you to build a company and then IPO or exit one day. I don't think you can live up to building a company if it's a summer or part-time gig.<p>Secondly I'll email you so you can tell me your idea as I assure you very few things are unique. In social networking almost nothing as there are hundreds of thousands of competitors.<p>You won't get investment by emailing investors sadly, you have to build relationships. This is the perfect time to do it.<p>Here's my advice. If you are interested in building a company (while doing college), raise some seed funding under 10k from an angel you build a relationship with or one of the many LA incubators and then build it through college with a co-founder. You'll be able to take your time, gain traction and if it does do well then you can take it further but will probably have to drop-out.<p>You don't have to have a co-founder but it makes sense for product decisions and actually building a great product. Freelancers are a waste of money and require a lot of work, if you want to build something real you'll eventually hire and having a co-founder makes sense for most. You can use what you already have towards it as it'll help to get a co-founder if you have something tangible.<p>By the way I'm not advocating college as the sole option, I'm not going at all but it really depends on what you're looking for any where you are on your journey.<p>By the way, you're in LA. A pretty huge tech scene, you should be making the most of it by going to lots of meetups and meeting founders and potential investors and partners! You have no excuse.",1341195044

I've also split my time in the US between east and west coast.<p>When abroad I have at times felt embarrassed to call myself an American.  Well, first of all, I hate the use of the term ""American"" because, well, we don't own the entire continent.  I feels utterly ignorant to say ""I am an American"".  In the UK at least you can say that you are a ""Yank"" and it is more accurate.  Anyhow, this might be a minor point.  Just because it is convenient I'll continue to use the ignorant reference and call myself an ""American"" in this post.<p>Yes, Americans are fat and ignorant.  At least that's a big part of what we project.  Some of it has to do with how egocentric we tend to be.  I have met Americans that have a hard time placing countries --much less cities-- on the globe.  You often hear things like ""I can't spell"" or ""I am not good at math"".  I can't recall ever hearing such expressions in other countries.  If you can't spell your own language or handle high-school level math you are actually looked down upon in a lot of cultures.  Just one step above an idiot.  It really sounds moronic from the vantage point of other cultures.  So, be aware of this fact.  While it might seem funny to you to make a comment like that, the other person could be thinking that you are a ""burro"".<p>I am the last person to propose that government get involved in directing behavior through taxation and the like.  I've posted before on the whole healthcare law mess.  However, there is one tax credit that I could probably get behind in a serious way if it was implemented correctly:  A tax incentive to have Americans travel abroad with some frequency.<p>I truly believe that we would fix a LOT of problems both here and elsewhere if the average US citizen had a more accurate world view.  In Europe it is easy to travel from culture to culture.  It's just a train ride away and it can be really cheap.  Here in the US it is harder and far more costly.  It is logical that most would simply travel a few hundred miles away within our country than get on a plane and see other shores.  An intelligently-done tax credit to promote foreign travel could do wonders in this area.  We need people to travel out of the country a few times (not just once) during their lifetime to gain perspective and learn.<p>If the average American understood what the world looks like on the outside and, perhaps more importantly, what the US looks like when looking-in, they would behave differently and vote differently.  We would be a different country.<p>The topic of religion in the US is also a tough one.  I, like most, grew up in a religious environment and later rejected it.  As an atheist now I can't help but see some of what goes on with all religions as nothing less than lunacy.  A collectively accepted state of dementia.  A tsunami kills hundreds of thousands of people and the religious still can't logically look at the gaping holes in their demented belief system.  At one point you'd hope that someone would rationalize that if their god truly listened to their prayers and helped their football team win a game while allowing someone to get killed or raped across town, or someone else half beaten to death at the stadium parking lot or hundreds of thousands of of people die in an earthquake...well, something ain't right.<p>Anyhow, the fact that American politics is so overly loaded with the need to express devotion, dedication and history with one religion, Christianity, is of great concern to those of us who can look at things from a different plane of thought.<p>From outside our country this looks ignorant and, well, ridiculous.<p>There are so many consequences to having religion as a dominant force in politics.  Gay rights and scientific research are two examples that come to mind.  It is personally offensive to me --not gay-- to hear believers who consider the gay to be unholy abominations (and worst).   When you try to explain that being gay is a genetic mutation (not a pejorative) that is no different from having blue eyes they laugh at you.  That's when the topic of evolution often comes-up.  It is personally offensive to me that they challenge evolution as though anything they could offer is even remotely relevant to the conversation.  You try to explain that the mechanism for evolution is the very reason that their kids don't look like perfect clones of each other, and they come up with counter-reasons that one couldn't even imagine.  And, when religion mixes with politics you have things like the drive to teach ""creationism"" to our kids.  Again, from many distant shores this looks nothing less than retarded.  And they are right.<p>A lot of the above is very negative.  Here's the good news:  There is a TON that is great about this country and this people.  We, with all of our faults, manage to have created a society that is orderly and, for the most part, law-driven.  Just ask an Argentinian about how their crazy governments and rampant corruption at all levels has, effectively, destroyed what used to be a very nice country.  In the US we disagree.  And, yes, polarization is horrible right now, but we somehow manage to run things reasonably well.<p>There's also a lot of creativity in this land.  There are cultures that have huge issues with this.  Both Europe and Asia have examples of this effect.  A lot of the behaviors and culture that the US promotes internally lead to finding diamonds in the rough and allowing them to shine through.<p>Yes, here you can be nobody and rise to be anything and anyone you can dream of becoming.  And that's why the US has led the world in a technical and, yes, cultural revolution that has had no equal.  I am proud of being an American, warts and all.  I strive to be above average and make sure that my kids develop a world view and cross cultural view from the get go.  I also respect other cultures and understand that nearly everyone who is positive in the world has something valuable to offer.  I could go on, but that's probably enough of a brain dump on this topic.",1341194807

If you plan to be the ""MINIX of realtime data streams"", I don't think I'll be developing for your platform.<p>Android is possibly a reasonable example, as I guess it did happen as a proprietary venture that went Open, but it's Open Source life happened under the oversight of Google, arguably the world's most important technology company. You don't have that kind of clout or that kind of market penetration. No one worried that Google would disappear next week, leaving a bunch of development spending un-recouped.<p>Finally, there is a pretty hard rule of the Internet, which is that infrastructure <i>will</i> be Open Source...and if it isn't today, it will be soon. HTTP, DNS, SMTP, SSL, video (HTML5, which replaced the proprietary Flash). There are still a few examples of non-Open services, and Web 2.0 (or whatever), was a valiant attempt to retake the web for proprietary interests; and the jury is out on whether Open Source and standards will eventually prevail. So, chat is back to being often proprietary, video and voice conferencing never had a viable Open Source option so it remains proprietary with competing standards, etc. But, I think for you to convince other companies to build on what you make, you'll have to either become big fast (like Twitter fast), or start Open. Or, you'll build just another also ran.<p>Of course, if you start Open Source, you'll never make a bajillion dollars on the software or service itself. So, you get to choose your priorities, and maybe shooting for the big money is more important than a better shot at building a standard that many people and companies use.",1341194789

I and some of my friends are netflix users and often asked each other if there was a good movie that we saw recently. That made me build this app. It is a simple app to share your favorite movies with others. It uses the Netflix API. The recently announced API changes will impact my app starting Sept 15, 2012. I came to know about those changes half way through building my app and thought about dropping the idea but then proceeded to build it anyways because I wanted to. I had originally planned to add Facebook integration but don't plan to go through with it because of the netflix API changes. I would love to hear feedback from the HN community. This is my first app so I may not have done some basic things right and would love the community to point that out so that I can improve going forward.",1341194601

Basically it made it very easy for virus writers to run powerful commands that the OS would blindly run. In response, Microsoft not only made scripts not executable by default, there is also a ""signing"" thingamajig where a script won't be executable unless it is specifically signed off to run[1], including those written by you.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SigningPowerShellScripts.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SigningPowerShellScripts.aspx</a><p>It also isn't a drop in replacement for the command prompt. They exist as two separate programs, instead of the Unix general Terminal and shells run inside.<p>In my experience, Powershell has a lot of potential but is hampered by clunky interfaces and the lack of a true robust security system across the OS. Add on top of that the large malware industry around Windows, Powershell is basically a non-starter as a replacement for the vanilla command prompt.",1341194543

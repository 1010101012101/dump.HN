Qt also looks and works well enough on Windows - at least, I never hear any complaints about Opera related to its UI toolkit.<p>The startup time can be a problem, and Clojure offering only JIT compilation doesn't improve things.",1225616069

351266,comment,351223,351239,0,0,DaniFong,,,"It's very interesting physics, but not exactly magical. One can think of it as magnetic field lines connecting or disconnecting between the earth and the sun. Charged particles, like in the solar wind, follow this field lines, and so there's a lot of particles transferred. Additionally, the particles themselves are rotating, and 'lock in' magnetic flux, so they transport magnetic flux between the sun and the earth, too.",1225615432

Nobody sticks a laptop in their pocket, and any bag is designed for a much thicker one than that, so there's really no use for it.<p>What there is use for is a spindle and multiple USB ports.",1225615229

The one I use is the clear one from Incase (they call it ""frost""), and while it protects against the usual stains, scrapes, etc. it has the unexpected side effect of making the glowing Apple logo on the lid look absolutely amazing in the dark.",1225614771

If passwords were being sent along too that would be something different but usernames are meant to be shared and usually somewhat public information.<p>Unless you're worried about the maker of the site ""stealing"" your identity on some site... although thats a pretty weak argument.

American, I can't say I've ever seen democracy practiced well enough to receive the supposed benefits, I'm a firm believer none the less.

351251,comment,334355,334355,0,0,bluenove,,,"I believe that beyond 'creating a startup', it is rather INNOVATION that is something that is more than ever needed in times of crisis and recession. That is both true for startup companies and may be even more so for major corporations and brands.\nAnd even more during deep crisis when internal resources are lacking and budget shrinking, major corporations will have no other choice than managing innovation in an 'Open and collaborative' new way, and especially collaborating with innovative startups... These major corporations will therefore have to transform themselves into 'Open innovation' champions faster than what they would have done in a more 'comfortable' economy.\nFrom a crisis to an opportunity ?\nPS: this change management mission is the 'raison d'etre' of bluenove (www.bluenove.com), and as its CEO and founder i still consider we are in a startup phase so this article is for the least quite supportive ;-)",1225612935

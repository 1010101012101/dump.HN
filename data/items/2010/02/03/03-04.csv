1097022,comment,1096963,1096963,0,0,jrockway,,,"My thoughts exactly; this is really not too exciting.  (I will disagree that web apps are never CPU-bound.  That has always been the bottleneck for me.)<p>I haven't seen the source code yet, but I think Chicken Scheme did everything HipHop does but many years ago.  And, there are some hard problems to solve when implementing Scheme, notably handling continuations.  PHP is much simpler in comparison.<p>I do see good things coming out of this project, though.  As people are enticed by the biggest temptress in computing, speed, they'll learn to run and deploy web applications that aren't as simple as ""ftp this HTML file to a directory"".  Once PHP's only advantage over other languages is gone, and developers realize that it wasn't that big of an advantage, they'll switch to better programming languages.  Then we can forget PHP ever happened, and the field can move on!",1265169540

If you have an asynchronous design for your server, concurrent connections don't cost physical threads - they just cost the bookkeeping overhead in the kernel. The faster you can switch between those connections, and get finished with work on them when I/Os complete, the fewer physical machines you need to serve a website to a given number of users.<p>Or to put it another way, the saturation point of processing asynchronous I/Os is CPU-bound, even when speeding up individual requests is I/O-bound.",1265169324

1096999,comment,1096639,1096860,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"I disagree about the long-term reliability of SSDs. Intel's X25-M has a 5 year warranty. They claim that writing 100GB/day for 5 years will not cause it to fail. If we compare the technologies in terms of reliability, flash has three things going for it:<p>1. Flash degrades predictably over time. Manufacturers know the average number of write cycles a cell can sustain and design SSDs with ""spare"" flash and wear leveling. They can engineer the expected lifetime of the drive. Hard drives usually fail spontaneously.<p>2. The most common failure mode for flash cells is to fail on write. Even if a cell gets ""stuck,"" the data can still be read. Hard drives fail on read or write, and in most cases all data on the drive is lost.<p>3. A 3.5"" 7200RPM drive's platters spin at 70mph on the outside edge. The head gap is measured in millionths of an inch, making them very susceptible to vibration and shock. Since SSDs have no moving parts, they're practically immune.<p>There are really only two disadvantages of SSDs: cost and capacity.",1265168593

Among the majority population, lobbying is seen as what businesses do to get laws written that are favorable to their interests, including tax breaks, energy subsidies, etc.  In <i>concept</i> people understand that when a congressperson needs to learn about something in order to make a decision, he or she should be talking to experts.  In practice (the perception is) those experts tend to try to persuade more than educate.  So, in the example of the drones flying for example, the lawmakers may be learning of all of the good outcomes of easing FAA regs and letting Amazon fly drones, and may even distinguish between large companies (or another grouping in which Amazon falls) and a grouping that their competitors may fall into (say, smaller companies) in a way that becomes a barrier to entry for the competitors.  This will obviously be seen as reasonable in some sense, but there may have been a better way to do things that didn&#x27;t raise the barrier for competition.

The trouble of this idea to me is for a lot of low income families we pretty much subsidize their lives and it honestly isn&#x27;t working. I grew up in an area of the country where we had tons of people living on welfare. Did they create? Did they add value to the community? Nope not at all. They were a drain the community. Take for instance a friend of mine we&#x27;ll call her Mary. She has three kids and she gets free child care and after school care. She also gets food stamps, low income housing, and is eligible for 2 free college classes a semester from the local university because she&#x27;s a single mom with low income. She&#x27;s also got her CNA licence. She holds no job despite offers from places in the community. Now according to this UBI theory she would be a prime candidate. We give her money and magically she begins to add value to the community because she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about money anymore. However we already do this and she&#x27;s a drain on the community. She takes and never gives back. Now let&#x27;s take another friend of mine we&#x27;ll call him James. He doesn&#x27;t have a job and didn&#x27;t qualify for college but he can code. His github account is filled with commits to all kinds of crazy projects. He just  loves to build things. He adds to the community.<p>My question to you is do we give every one UBI because I&#x27;m not really ok with that. If James said man I&#x27;m short on rent this month I&#x27;d give him $100 but if Mary said she need $100 for diapers and cloths I&#x27;d refuse because she has places to get that and if she&#x27;s short on money its most likely her own mismanagement of cheques.

Perhaps more efforts to establish professional and social networks of weak ties would be an effective strategy within identities group that are underrepresented.

11053106,comment,11047133,11052646,0,0,winestock,,,"Here are some reasons why people believe those things.<p>First off, in the context of the Vietnam War, VC stands for Viet Cong.  I think that you mean North Vietnam, instead, because the Viet Cong were spent as a fighting force after the Tet Offensive.  Thereafter, the Vietnam War was mostly a fight between regular armies.<p>In 1969, Richard Nixon began a modest pull-out of US troops from Vietnam.<p>In 1972, North Vietnam <i>invaded</i> South Vietnam with 150,000 troops.  They had support from the Soviet Union in the form of tanks.  Lots of tanks.  Zhukov would&#x27;ve been proud of that force.  South Vietnam <i>defended</i> themselves with help from the United States in the form of air support.<p>Result: Fewer than 50,000 North Vietnamese soldiers made it back North.  American KIA: 650.<p>Perhaps not coincidentally, peace talks improved for a while before breaking down in mid-December 1972.  Nixon then ordered North Vietnamese cities to be bombed for eleven days (the &quot;Christmas Bombings&quot;).  Perhaps not coincidentally, peace talks resumed.  On January 27, 1973, both sides agreed to a cease fire, America would withdraw all of its forces, all POWs would be released, and South Vietnam would remain independent (<i>of the North</i>).  By the end of 1973, all US troops were gone.<p>Being a bunch of communists, the North Vietnamese lied about their end of the deal.  How&#x27;s that for fair and square?  They kept fighting to subjugate South Vietnam with the full support of the Soviet Union.  South Vietnam fought on with aid from the United States... until August 1974 (thanks, Congress!).<p>So, strictly speaking, America didn&#x27;t lose the Vietnam War in much the same way that tomato is a fruit and not a vegetable.  See?  History can be complicated.<p>As for &quot;doom predictions of the time,&quot; well, North Vietnam proceeded to aid communists elsewhere in Indo-China, just as the war hawks predicted (cf., Domino Theory: <a href=""http://thevietnamwar.info/domino-theory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thevietnamwar.info/domino-theory/</a> )  By 1975, Cambodia and Laos had fallen to communist insurgents.  In all of these places, they instituted revolutionary socialist reforms to overturn the legacy of foreign colonialist occupiers.  These reforms so impressed the locals that more than a million of them took to the high seas in hand-made boats in order to return to those self-same &quot;occupiers.&quot;<p>Here, in America, we have a number of Vietnamese neighborhoods made up of those people and their progeny.  The grey hairs among them would take issue with your evaluation of modern Vietnam as &quot;a functioning state.&quot;<p><a href=""http://ngothelinh.tripod.com/50_years_communist_crimes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ngothelinh.tripod.com/50_years_communist_crimes.html</a>",1454858522

The paragraph starting  with &#x27;Rust wins, here&#x27;, is just a general turnoff to read the rest of the article.\nWhen I read the title &#x27;Rust vs. C++: Fine-grained performance&#x27; I was honestly expecting either a table with performance times across various algorithms, or a savvy optimization guide. \nI wasn&#x27;t expecting a LoC duke-it-out.<p>Input file processing \n- Both are conceptually boilerplate code.

If we discard children (15 and younger) I would be very surprised to find that half of the country is unaware of the war.<p>I think the confusion here is coming from the Idea that the US lost the war. They did not. There were two groups of winners and losers. On the winning side, you have Vietnam, Thailand, the US, and Japan. On the losing side you have France, Laos, Cambodia, and China. The last one was the true &quot;enemy&quot; the US was confronting. Given the recent developments in the Spratly&#x27;s and Cam Ranh Bay, i think it is even more clear that the US, losses notwithstanding, gained much from the Vietnam Conflict.<p>Another point brought up by another comment was that the US does not fight at &quot;home&quot;. This is intentional and the US has been very successful in this regard. Even if the US is forced to abandon policy aims as well as territory, it is hard to see it as a loss when it continues to economically prosper.<p>Wars are not like sporting events; there is no official scorecard.

Looking at the plight of African Americans in this country in a critical fashion would reveal that they also are subject to significant struggles that should be acknowledged.<p>Nowhere in that above sentiment lies any notion of spreading hatred towards white people.

One day, it really &quot;clicked&quot; that the behavior was totally unproductive. However, I didn&#x27;t want to just passively accept the traffic status quo. Instead, I opted for what I call my &quot;slow drive&quot;:<p>1. Always drive in the right lane;<p>2. Always make sure the car ahead is slowly pulling away;<p>3. Always make sure there is space on my left for someone to pass me on the left.<p>The 3rd rule is the hardest, and I will admit to some dickish behavior to stop other drivers from pacing me &quot;on the left&quot;, or (worse) in my blind spot---mostly by very tightly hugging the center line, or by turning on my blinker and slowly moving into the left lane.<p>As a practical nuts-and-bolts, I&#x27;m averaging about 5mph less than I used to, but a wash on total commute times---I&#x27;m usually at the front of lights, and jackrabbit to clear the intersection.<p>My favorite part is seeing <i>dozens</i> of cars passing on the left at high speed, while (on one occasion) more than a dozen cars were very slowly plodding behind me.<p>I&#x27;m certain there were angry people trying to turn right but, considering I&#x27;m going as much as 15mph below the posted limit, a little forethought would have them passing me---it is this very thoughtlessness that I&#x27;m targeting.<p>There also a lot of rural one lane highways out where I&#x27;m at.

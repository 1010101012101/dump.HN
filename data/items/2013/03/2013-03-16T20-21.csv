5386776,comment,5386196,5386503,4,0,mmahemoff,,,"As the OP, I agree it's sad that decentralized standards haven't ""won"" in the way they were expected to 10 years ago; it's the reason we now have Facebook, Twitter, and Google connect buttons instead of just Open ID.<p>The question is, when you say ""it's time"", how do you make it happen? Google tried to make it happen with standards like OpenSocial, but the trade-off for increased flexibility was often poorer UX, and meanwhile they watched developers jump onto standards that were more closed, but had many more users.<p>There's certainly a sweet spot where open standards meet a mainstream user base; the web and HTML5 overall continue to do fine, notwithstanding heavy competition from the more closed native platforms. This is very much due to the great amount of innovation amongst browsers and web apps, both of which touch the user directly, and less because users care about open for open's sake.<p>So my suggestion is if you want to encourage open standards, focus on the user first.",1363467557

Sure, somewhat, and increasingly this is harder and harder to do.  But society is lost in the middle not on the fringes.<p>We live in the Panopticon [1] and this is a problem for many reasons.  When a small elite can strengthen its ability to pull the levers of power decision making is concentrated in a smaller and smaller group.  Small groups make worse decisions than large scale collective ""marketplaces"" of ideas and thought.  This is what allowed the US and the West to flourish for so long.  But it's easily lost.  We are moving to a world where elections lead to less and less change, where major problems are going unresolved and punted to a future on the assumption that exponentially growing challenges can be out-waited.  The only hope is in the increased connectivity of the Internet, access to information, and ability to share dissenting views.  As this is taken away, to preserve Hollywood profits, and in the name of ""security"", we run further and further off the cliff.<p>Even Wylie Coyote has to look down eventually and see that it's time to fall to the canyon floor.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon</a>",1363467387

They sometimes like to pretend to themselves that work isn't about money, and the laws of supply and demand shouldn't apply to labor.<p>You should work for us because, it's, like, really great! You should want to work 55 hours a week because you really want to! The fact that you're creating stockholder wealth is merely incidental.<p>Every company in the valley seems to pay ""market wages"" and then complain that there's simply not enough talent out there. It shouldn't be about the money for them. They should want to work here, because it's so great!<p>People should be paid what's ""fair"" and should want to work as much as is practical. Some kid out of college should be paid what's fair for them as a person - it's like a moral issue - not according to the value they create for the company, which can be enormous even if it's just a kid of school. And we need rock stars, not warm bodies, even if the gain to the company from hiring each non-rock star is still enormous.<p>I am familiar with several SV firms that would make like $400,000 per year per new hire, but insist on paying ""market wages"" based on experience, and then complain it's impossible to find enough people to hire. You think if we were on wall street a firm would hesitate to double someone's salary if the firm thought they could make double that by hiring them? No one in SV wants to compete on pay. Everyone wants to convince themselves that they've created the greatest place on earth to work, and that everyone should work there because it's so great. The fact that they create wealth for the stockholders is a benign coincidence.<p>If SV ran the retail industry, everyone with the same job titles would make pretty much the same amount of money working at either Saks Fifth Avenue or Old Navy. What if Saks wanted to hire someone away from Old Navy? They would try to convince them that Saks is really great!! Not because Saks could see that it could gain more from the person working for them than at Old Navy than Old Navy would and can therefore pay them more. That's economic efficiency. But it seems kind of crass, doesn't it? You should want to work for us! Because it's so great, and we'll give you a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of the equity.<p>What if I went around telling employers I wanted a strict 40 hour work week? How suddenly would they forget about that hiring shortage? Wanting to work less shows you don't <i>care</i>. You should want to work here. Not because by you working here it creates more wealth for us than we're going to pay you. You think that multiple still doesn't apply if someone is working 13% less hours!? But someone who wants to work less doesn't <i>care</i>, and you should want to work and want to work here as much as possible.<p>I get six dozen recruiter emails a week. All of them sound exactly the same - you should work here because it's so great! None of them want to compete on fundamentals - pay me more and give me more vacation time. How distasteful!

However, if you look at what makes you win or loose at the ""micro"" level it is a little simpler.<p>If you bet on a single number the ball only has to move one slot for you to loose.  As it lands on the number field the ball has a bunch of excess energy. The surfaces are hard and it bounces around with great efficiency.  It can go over one or more number fences very easily.<p>In fact, if you study every single common bet, single numbers, rows, columns, dozens, color, even/odd, etc. they all share one trait: If the ball jumps over just ONE fence you loose.<p>If you've played roulette enough you'll eventually run into this stereotype:  Big guy.  Smells and looks like money.  Shows up with piles of cash, gold watch and gold chain around his neck.  And starts to place piles of cash on numbers he is pulling out of his anal orifice.  Most of the time these guys loose a ton of money.  Why?  The ""one fence"" problem.<p>OK, I think that sets it up.  Actually, it is probably beyond obvious at this point.  Take a look at a roulette wheel and think about how you should bet to solve the problem that makes every single common bet nearly worthless.<p>The genius of the roulette is in the wheel.",1363465351

But what I've discovered over the last few years is that sometimes maximising productivity requires knowing when to take a break from the problem.  A lot of time I'll spend an hour trying to work on something, hit an obstacle, try to push on it a bit, realise that it's hard, then just take a break from it until I have better inspiration on how to deal with it.  Then a week or month later, once the idea for a solution has crystalised, then I can do a big push and get it done.<p>Also, just walking around thinking is the most productive time of my day.",1363464423

In this case the drivers have no power since many other drivers are willing to step in to take their place. Uber has all the power, so they are going to do nothing about what this small group of driver's demands.

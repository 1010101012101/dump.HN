I agree with him, I support the principle of equal pay for both men and women, however equal pay is complete BS. There shouldn't even be equal pay between solely male or female workers, because quite simply no one does the exact same amount of work.<p>Even if you're tasked with making 50 microchips a day and two people produce 50 microchips a day, there's still lots of other factors involved. What if one person's trained in first aid? What if one's a real douchbag and pisses everyone off, shouldn't they be punished because they aren't conducive to a company environment?<p>The variables are huge, and unless two people are identical duplicates beamed down from space, then I don't believe they should be paid the same <i>just because it's nice</i>.",1241362356

590871,comment,590460,590460,0,0,edw519,,,"My 2 biggest helpers to ""coding quickly"":<p>1.  I have written over 10,000 programs, but I have started about 5 of them from scratch.  I just grab the closest thing and proceed to change it.  I realize that doesn't help you much right now, but it tells you the same thing you'd hear in any endeavor: start building now.<p>2.  When you start building now, build ""building blocks"", pieces of code you can use over and over again.  A good program that's 300 lines of code could have as many as 100 calls to other functions or subroutines.  Isaac Newton achieved greatness by ""standing on the shoulders of giants"".  You should do the same thing, even standing on your own shoulders once in a while.",1241362183
590870,comment,590460,590460,0,0,tom_b,,,"I google more before deciding how to code to a specific problem.  I want to understand the problem better, see how it's been approached by others, if there are standard approaches, etc.  This helps me crystallize my thoughts and get quick prototypes put together.<p>Your question is about your ""internal toolkit"" and your speed when coding.  As your experience becomes richer and more varied, your feel (or dare I say, taste) will improve and you'll be quicker because of it.  A problem will tickle some part of your brain and you'll have a much more intuitive understanding of how to use your external tools (php/kohana) to best solve it.  For that you do need some strong understanding of what's available in your development language of choice - memorization isn't the answer, but you should be able to remember off-hand that library X solves problem Y and might apply here . . .<p>It has been valuable to me to expand my knowledge of development styles and languages, so try to work in some tasks that use some very different stacks than php and kohana.  If you can find a good mentor or peer group, I think that can be valuable in your growth as a programmer.<p>There's a bit of the gunslinger mentality floating around right now re: coding speed.  Stuff like the Yale programming class where data exists on the time it took students to correctly solve a programming assignment (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/HighNotes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/HighN...</a>).  The conclusion made there is ""(t)he quality of the work and the amount of time spent are simply uncorrelated.""  So right now, hackers seem to be making sure people know how much faster they are than everybody else.  Ignore a bunch of this fluff.<p>There are arguments that if you're not one of the ""rock-stars"" you'll never create software as beautiful as one of the 1-in-100 hackers.  I think this is a little true (innate talent is something that exists) but we as hackers should think more about our work as craft.  Maybe most people can't be wonderful artists, but craftsmen (and women) have built some beautiful things over the years.<p>So work on your code as a craftsman.  Care about it.  Read what others do.  Ask for feedback.  Develop a habit of deliberate coding.  Be patient, and be your own worst critic and best supporter.<p>And good luck - what we do is quite a bit of fun.",1241362084

If the first concern that pops to mind whenever you need to add a feature or change something is ""how can I do this in the least amount of code"", you'll be depressed when comes the time to code something that simply inherently takes a huge amount of code to tackle. You'll be less likely to make that big refactoring that would greatly enhance the consistency of your codebase and facilitate further developments.<p>As it is, my codebase is a place I spend most of my life in, so I like to keep the place tidy and know where everything is.

I did this even to huge packages (100+ MB) and they just worked with no process. It was mysterious, almost disconcerting. And if I did things this way, other users didn't know where to find them.<p>Then you have other packages which launch the installer. As longwinded as they are, they give me a sense of control and make me feel more comfortable even if the same process is happening.<p>You can tell that I'm a latecomer to the OS X scene; frankly still don't know where the apps are going, but because it is hidden from me already, I don't want to bother. I always launch with spotlight and I have only opened the Applications folder once.<p>MacPorts was also highly confusing: you get a second Python. OpenCV installs to the system, PIL installs to ports. Now I'm sure there's a way to do so-and-so, but coming from w32/linux, it's just download, install.",1241361555

590851,comment,590479,590773,0,0,GHFigs,,,"There is no splitting hairs when you use phrases like ""unequivocally user-unfriendly"". This is not a minor detail. You are wrong.<p>Comparing to the previous interface is a non-starter, as you don't account for the differences.  Previously, none of the file sharing protocols had an interface for choosing which folders to share and with what permissions.  Now that there is such an interface, the three options for sharing files are grouped behind that common function. This makes the first layer consistent about <i>what</i> is being shared and the second (Options...) about <i>how</i>, an extremely common and familiar style of interface. If it is ""unequivocally user-unfriendly"" here, why is it tolerable in a hundred other places in almost every GUI?<p>Dismissing my view as that of a developer (which I am not) does not give you the authority to speak for the supposed ""average user"". It does not take a particularly sophisticated user to find the right pane (as my previous post showed), and once found, even the solitary use of jargon is at most a speed-bump. Even the help button on that very same pane leads to a clear answer. Using unambiguous and factually accurate terminology in the interface is not arcane or secret just because the meaning is not <i>immediately obvious</i> to all potential users.  Consider terms like ""Ethernet"", ""WiFi"", or ""DVD"".  Should we banish these terms from interfaces, too?<p>I have no idea what you mean by ""un-automate"". The entire process here is user-driven.  The operating system is not doing anything without explicit user action.  Are you against the idea of using sensible defaults?",1241360712

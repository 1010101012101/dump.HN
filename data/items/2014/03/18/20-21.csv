I used to be CTO at a company that developed an Android runtime for WebOS. You might infer they could do the same for similar platforms. Jolla has demonstrated Myriad&#x27;s similar technology running Android apps in Sailfish. So while there isn&#x27;t as cleanly defined boundary between app runtime and OS as with JavaFX, which is designed to be cross-platform, in practice it is possible to move the Android runtime across platforms with good results. It should even be possible to put Android apps into realizable windows in desktop environments.<p>There is a lot to be said for taking an environment with a big following and making it cross-platform vs making a cross-platform environment and hoping for adoption.",1395176229

The difference between slowing down traffic from A or prioritizing traffic from B is of course mostly academic: the result is the same. The extra bandwidth for the priority traffic doesn&#x27;t magically appear out of thin air, and the fact that providers are allowed to charge for it (i.e., it&#x27;s not about optimizing traffic for technical reasons) means it kills net neutrality stone dead.<p>Also, it would override the law in EU countries that have actual net neutrality.<p>So it serves three purposes: make it harder to adopt net neutrality in the EU in the future, make it impossible for individual EU member states to adopt net neutrality independently (would be against EU rules), and kill net neutrality in countries that already have it (ditto).<p>The whole idea behind this proposal is not some kind of compromise (which would be bad enough), it&#x27;s to kill net neutrality in the EU now and forever.<p>The scariest part is that the European parliament, which is usually harder to manipulate than the backroom dealings of committees and national politicians (see ACTA), appears to have a majority in favor of this faux neutrality.

You&#x27;re comparing MVC frameworks to jQuery as if that made sense, which it doesn&#x27;t.<p>As I said, Angular and Backbone use jQuery. So you&#x27;re just comparing how you&#x27;ve used jQuery (as if that&#x27;s how any jQuery user would do it) to how they&#x27;ve used jQuery. There is no such thing as &quot;idiomatic&quot; jQuery templating. There are only plugins and libraries that use jQuery to do templating. In fact, what you&#x27;ve done in the jQuery rendering test is incredibly bad practice and is greatly discouraged in the jQuery community. Again, your tests don&#x27;t make sense.<p>If you need me to explicate my pointer further, the jQuery &quot;security test&quot; is you asking jQuery to do something stupid and it following orders. It&#x27;s absurd. You might as well add a native test saying that document.documentElement.innerHTML = &quot;a\\&quot;><img src=\\&quot;javascript:;\\&quot; onerror=\\&quot;alert(&#x27;alert box should not appear&#x27;)\\&quot;>&quot;; has a security hole.

7424870,comment,7423648,7424511,4,0,joe_the_user,,,"I think the problem being discussed is fairly start-up specific. And moreover, I think it kind of involves an assumption that start-up organization structures are the direction in which organizations in general should be going. As far as I can tell, start-up organization structure is as informal as possible. The aim is to leverage trust and flexibility that can be found in a group of close friends.<p>I would point out that moving in this direction is moving in a sort-of opposite direction to the direction that society went when we human made the transition to a modern capitalist/bureaucratic society. The reason you have bureaucracy, human resource, job descriptions and all the rest is that this allows a person to be separated from a job. There&#x27;s lots of inveigling against &quot;being a cog in a machine&quot; but it should be remembered that a cog has clear obligations and clear rewards. And the cog is essentially a compartment - a person&#x27;s social life, relationship involvement, cultural values and whatnot are kept at arms length. And it is a bit clunky, bureaucracy implies people aren&#x27;t using these factors as means to make quicker decisions.<p>So in a sense, &quot;chucking all the bureaucracy&quot; sort of guarantees that you will have a situation where a monoculture of something will dominate. Because someone similar to the existing group can most easily &quot;fit right in&quot;. And the aim is quick, unmediated action rather than any formal processes. (Edit: and the easiest monoculture is young white men but that would just be an example, not a PC inveigling again this particular group).<p>In the bureaucratic paradigm, a chat with a boss shouldn&#x27;t involve implication of friendship and from there relationship interest - and in a well-function bureaucracy, it doesn&#x27;t. In a start-up, the implications of a chat are totally informal and thus the implication of friend would be there and so the implication of relationship interest can easily appear - the bad part of &quot;no walls&quot; is clearest.",1395175740

I&#x27;m generalist (business & some tech & design).<p>More: I recently established an art-focused e-commerce startup, centered on redefining discoverability with a twist and direct sales of unique goods from indie designers. Planning to join an accelerator soon and would love to have a team in order to grow and capitalize on the program&#x27;s resources and connections.<p>Rather than speed dating and swiftly declaring love until death do us part, I figured an extended dating trial of a few months might be more practical. Compensation could be structured as stipend paid during the accelerator period followed by negotiated equity (on vesting schedule) if both parties agree to continue working together. Possibility for full salary when the startup gets funding (or reaches applicable sales milestone first).<p>I&#x27;m open to partners from anywhere, as long as you can relocate to North America to participate in accelerator and possibly stay afterwards (open to half remote/virtual then, preferably within same timezone).

Despite interesting projects like Meteor, or big frameworks like Ember, I continue to prefer Backbone to build rich — ambitious — web applications. Having a lean and simple event system is the magic behind Backbone as a library. It gives the developer flexibility in their application design. The weakness of Backbone is really a weakness of the developer using it: you can fall prey to poor design that&#x27;s not manageable as scale grows.<p>One of the most frustrating areas of Backbone, as this post talks about, is view management. Rendering and subview management can be thorny issues. Some people look to help from things like Marionette, or ditch Backbone altogether for frameworks that impose convention and take render management away from the developer.<p>The past several weeks I&#x27;ve been really impressed with React. It is a fantastic, light-weight library for building reusable components and it plays very nicely with Backbone. You can mix together Backbone.Model, .Collection, .Events, but then ditch Backbone.View in favor of React components. It&#x27;s incredibly fast, thanks to its virtual DOM and diff implementation, and gives you flexibility without needing to worry about render management. Everytime I&#x27;ve refactored a Backbone View into a React component, I think, &quot;Wow, that&#x27;s it?&quot;<p>In terms of design patterns, since React components only have parent-child communications, Backbone&#x27;s existing Events are still a great way to manage communication and convey state between components.<p>I really encourage everyone to give React a look.

There should be legal consequences for people who leak this content against the wish of the people depicted, but I feel the media often plays up the narrative that people shouldn&#x27;t take nude pictures (a pragmatic approach, but not the best going forward) and never mentions the silliness of reacting harshly to other people&#x27;s sexuality.<p>However, the pragmatic approach is still needed in a world where many people can attack you for your idiosyncrasies. Depending on your current situation, you won&#x27;t lose your job and your particular interest will become only a minor office joke, but when you run for Congress, the masses may still care too much about it.<p>As someone mentioned on HN, the advantage of being transparent is that you can weaponize it — &quot;I do (thing) and if that worries you, it&#x27;s your problem, not mine&quot;.<p>And start downloading kinds of porn you have no interest in, just to confuse the snoops ;)",1395172875

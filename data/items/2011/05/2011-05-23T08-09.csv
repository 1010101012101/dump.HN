From my own observation, many people go through life with a smattering of interests - but nothing that inspires them and truly grips them.<p>""Having interests"" is not the same as ""having passions"".<p>But even disregarding that, many people do not understand <i>creation</i>. A passion for watching TV or playing video games maps poorly to someone obsessed with creating things - whether it's sculpture, software, music, or architecture. Personally I find it very difficult to identify with non-creators, while there is a very natural mesh when I talk with other creators - even if I know nothing of their craft.

The twelve year old girls would enthusiastically participate.  At thirteen, if they were remotely popular, you could forget about it.

In SL, to create, you have to be in a place which allows you to create (most likely one you rent, or a sandbox). You have to know how to create, and the learning step is quite high. You have to pay actual money to upload any texture or mesh to the game.<p>So the ""god"" possibilities are high, but not accessible to most of people.

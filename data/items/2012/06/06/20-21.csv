I encourage you to check it out.  It's quite simply ""the future of password hashing"".  (Bcrypt will be defeated by natural advances in multi-core hardware; scrypt won't ever be.)<p>Passwords hashed with scrypt with sufficiently-high strength values (there are 3 tweakable input numbers) are fundamentally impervious to being cracked.  I use the word ""fundamental"" in the literal sense, here; even if you had the resources of a large country, you would not be able to design any hardware (whether it be GPU hardware, custom-designed hardware, or otherwise) which could crack these hashes.  Ever.  (For sufficiently-small definitions of ""ever"".  At the very least ""within your lifetime""; probably far longer.)",1339016392
4076196,comment,4075873,4076166,3,0,pmylund,,,"I agree there are a ton of articles saying ""Use bcrypt."" After Coda's post (<a href=""http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/</a>) it's almost become a meme. I don't, however, think that the people who say ""Use bcrypt!"" tend to explain why they say that.<p>I think the reason that this happens so often is that regular developers just don't care. But that's because they don't know why they should care. Given a proper explanation (and an attention span longer than ""Squirrel!""), any reasonable developers would (at least, should) care.",1339016387

4076194,comment,4075761,4075761,2,0,daave,,,"> Members that have accounts associated with the compromised passwords will notice that their LinkedIn account password is no longer valid.<p>I wonder if they know how those particular hashes that were leaked got stolen, if not, they should assume the whole database was stolen and only some of it has been leaked publicly, thus necessitating that this action be taken for <i>all</i> users accounts, not just the ones that match the hashes in the leak.<p>> It is worth noting that the affected members who update their passwords and members whose passwords have not been compromised benefit from the enhanced security we just recently put in place, which includes hashing and salting of our current password databases.<p>Huh? For people who change their password, fine, but 'for members whose passwords have not been compromised', how are they re-hashing them with salt unless they have the original (plaintext) passwords on file. Or are they doing H(salt + H(pass)), rather than H(salt + pass)?<p>If the latter, then hopefully they are at least re-hashing your password next time you log in, but most people don't log in very often - my cookies certainly haven't been expired. A co-worker tells me that even after changing his password through the website, the login credentials on the Android app were not expired!",1339016377
4076193,comment,4075873,4076166,6,0,leftnode,,,"I imagine things like this is a result of the account management part of LinkedIn being built years ago when we thought plain-jane sha1 was ok to use, and then they just never got around to using bcrypt.<p>Ironically, the algorithm to upgrade to bcrypt is simple. Add a flag to the account table if they've upgraded or not.

4076181,comment,4074501,4075631,3,0,nilliams,,,"I agree with you that 'massively bloated' is a huge overstatement, and this plugin is clearly intended for desktop-style apps as an improvement to the default desktop-browser's select element. In desktop-land the 32kb it takes to download jQuery (min+gz) is absolutely nothing, and easily overshadowed by a single image file.<p>Perspective: My company has a jQuery/jQueryUI single-page web app (with MVC underpinnings) which serves a number of commercial customers very successfully. Does it matter that the whole app (which includes this plugin) may take 2-10 seconds to load from a cold-cache? No. After that there is absolutely zero load time throughout the entire app.<p>Btw, we also don't care about oldIE because we can insist commercial customers install Chrome-frame, which they are generally happy to do. They'd much rather that than we push a new 'native' desktop app at them and require them to install a .NET or Java runtime.<p>I wish people moaning about bloat and browser-support would actually think about the developers out there building products for very really use-cases that don't match their own mythical high-expectations of 'zero footprint/works-everywhere'.

Both Tweetbot and Instagram exist solely as native applications - which means that it makes business sense for them to develop natively.<p>Companies like OkCupid and LinkedIn, whose apps both rely heavily on web views, need to think about the benefits of using the same code across multiple platforms.

They certainly lack some of the really slick transitions and polish of an app like Tweetbot, but I definitely don't think either one feels cheap.",1339016117

Flipboard and InstaPaper wanted to make great iOS apps and spent the time and effort to learn the right away. And it took well over a year for a native Android port of InstaPaper. When your value proposition is finesse and performance, go native.<p>If BingoCardCreator wants an iOS port so teachers can easily drag and drop words using touch on an iPad while sitting in front of the TV, I don't see why Patrick/BCC should spend months and months learning ObjC when he could just hook something up easily with jQuery draggables UI.<p>I've released ObjC and PhoneGap apps on the App Store and frankly, like everything else in life, you have to make the best use of the resources (time/budget/energy) available to you to make the best product. What this blog post is saying, is that just because you use PhoneGap, does not necessarily mean your application will be subpar. You must know how to use it well.<p>Also, RubyMotion uses the exact same iOS objects as ObjC does (and then some). So it should be no different than coding natively in ObjC.",1339015437

You then have to deal with conductive losses and the efficiency of a heat engine.<p>This is not directly comparable to the energy density of gasoline or a lithium ion battery which use chemical reactions to store the energy.

Left to run rampant, piracy could create a situation where it wasn't viable to run that business anymore, which I would care about.  However, the claim has long been countered by people saying that the business themselves are in a better position to deal with this problem without additional government involvement.  I believe this article and the other from dcurtis clearly shows that the later is true for HBO.<p>Yes, the market is functioning, and I like it just fine.  Piracy is creating a ceiling on how much a company can charge for their product while still making it widely available for enjoyment of people.  Piracy in this case is serving as price discrimination allowing the most possible number of people to enjoy it while those who are able to afford it or care enough are paying for it.  It appears as though the current market is doing a rather nice job of maximizing social benefit.<p>Would I steal gas or McRibs, no, those are both a clearly limited item.  Now diamonds are a fun one I have never thought of.  Rumor has it that there are warehouses full of diamonds they DeBeers keeps of the market to drive up the price of diamonds as a jewelry item.  Hypothetically, lets say I had designed a new industrial laser than would help make the lives of other human beings better off, but I need a giant diamond that at current artificially restricted price doesn't make economic sense.  In this case, yes, I think I would steal a diamond and not feel bad about it.  But then again, although I am not a purist, many of my ideas about morality are utilitarian.

A landlord's obligation to his tenants are to provide a place that's fit for habitation (There are some things like a functional phone jack in definition of that), ensure that any hazards that may be caused by damage to the building are rectified in a timely manner, and to address any tenant's complaints regarding those two items.<p>A written lease will generally only <i>add</i> restrictions on one or both parties.

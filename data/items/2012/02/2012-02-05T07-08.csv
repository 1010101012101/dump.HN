Unfortunately in our culture criticizing religion is considered wrong. I did not even criticize any religion in particular  but criticized a specific idea, an idea contradicted by scientific evidence. Religion should not be untouchable when its teaching contradict science. No Hate mongering or vitriol here. Implying that the doctrine of special creation is flat wrong is not hate mongering, it is simply telling the truth.",1328428725

The exact reason this is done is to ensure they're being compensated fairly and don't go off shopping for offers.<p>It's not true that management has the goal of minimizing comp for employees. Management tries to minimize _total compensation expenses_, which includes the costs associated with replacing an employee (and those costs can equal a full YEAR of comp in most cases.) Not to mention the disruption to projects that occurs when a key team member departs.<p>Really smart tech companies take a step farther: if you're in good standing when you leave, they have a special process for hiring you back if you decide you want to come back later. It's smart: they expect that lots of the best employees will want to try their hand at a startup or smaller venture at some point, but they don't burn the bridge with someone they know is a good team member.",1328427035

If the belly is full, the diaper clean and there no sign of other discomfort, then I think letting cry is an option. Happy parents is the best gift you can give to you kids, and stress, sleep deprivation, guilt, etc, are not the way to be happy.",1328426378

3553511,comment,3551684,3552424,1,0,tw342,,,"Agreed with most of what you said.  However I find the cost of living in silicon valley to be an issue.<p>I think companies should do something really crazy.   They should go and develop a new area which would eventually beat silicon valley.   Where engineers can find very affordable rents, and very affordable modern deco houses.  Where the weather is sunny, driving engineers who sit all day in offices to go outside and get some vitamin D.  Where the gender ratio is balanced.   Where your neighbors are good at other stuff and are willing to share there knowledge, like a real world quota.com.<p>A engineer, earning 120k from year 0 - 4, should very easily be able to save 250k and live comfortably in a 5 year timespan and not have to cut corners.<p>PG, there is a real problem here with silicon valley.   I don't think the salaries are too low but I think the cost of living is too high.<p>If you truly want to be innovative and crazy, broaden your world beyond the web.",1328426046

Other countries have different definitions of citizen.<p>IMHO citizenship by birthright is a pretty absurd notion, but its largely the default for historical reasons tied to war and conscription. Originally governments only gave you the right to citizenship in exchange for the ability to send you to war to protect often economic interests.<p>The world would be for more efficient and interesting is the ""market"" for citizenships were far more liquid and people could easily choose their government the way they can already do internationally by moving from state to state and city to city.",1328425783

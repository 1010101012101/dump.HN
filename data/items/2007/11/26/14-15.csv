83569,story,,,15,19,Novash,"Ask YC: The way hackers plan software",,"Company's willing to refactor heavily some main software of ours. We want to port all Delphi code to .NET so we can abandon a lot of legacy code. We've been planing said new software (suposed to do the same the actual does) for nearly two weeks already. Every module we cross is like trying to find the cure for cancer, and right now, I left the meeting because the main module of the project is being fully rewritten since it is prone to failure in some expected error condition and I don't want to have anythind to do with the mess they are designing (we work with hardware that wears out after a while and starts malfunctioning). Sorry about the whole rambling. My question is kind of simple. Do you start planing by the most complicated module to the simplest one, or the opposite? How do you design / plan your softwares at all?",1196087638

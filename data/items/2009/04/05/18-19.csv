A few things stand out about your view:<p>You support public financing of education, but only when there is also public delivery of education services.<p>The objective of public financing of education is economic egalitarianism -- why should a kid not be able to go to school just b/c his parents can't afford it or don't consider it a worthwhile expenditure.<p>By objecting to some cases of public financing of education (such as vouchers) you seem to think that a kid whose parents are poor or who do not value education should have only one option, public school.  I'm curious why you feel the need to limit the choices of the poor kid so much, but not the rich kid -- why shouldn't all parochial schools be banned?<p>It may be the case that you oppose the public funding of k-12 education.  If that's the case, your argument is at least consistent.  But you would then need to admit that since most people pay quite different amounts of property taxes, etc., that some deserve a refund and some deserve to have to pay extra even for public school.",1238957694

If you understand both New York-style trash talk [1] and intense hacker geniuses, you will understand Zed Shaw. He seemed like a nice guy, the couple of times I met him.<p>But the trash-talking aspect of his personality doesn't translate well to a text-only online persona. The body language and expression and tone and intensity and back-and-forth are all lost, as is the context: He can't tune his approach to his audience, because he doesn't have any feedback.<p>He seems to have figured that out now and is making a deliberate attempt to change his online persona.<p>One big problem with the internet is that you must develop a completely different online voice from your offline voice if you don't want your words to be taken the wrong way.

If library books were not available, it's unlikely I would have been able to read much beyond my school textbooks.<p>If the argument is that print book eventually wear out, forcing libraries to replace them, then by all means figure out the average number of ""lends"" before a library replaces a book, and provide books to libraries with limits along those lines. I assume that print books last far more than 26 lends.<p>In the face of radically improved theoretical access to information, changes to the library model that reduce the availability of books for people of limited means should be very carefully considered.<p>And yes, I know that libraries can still purchase and make available print books, but they have limited budgets. Libraries will be pressured to offer e-books, and if e-books cost substantially more than print books did per lend, that will result in a smaller number of available books for the most disadvantaged.",1324853712

3391772,comment,3387857,3388371,2,0,justin_vanw,,,"No, this has nothing to do with poverty.  This has to do with people who believe they are entitled to the 'american dream' but refuse to sacrifice or work hard, or compromise in any way to achieve that dream.<p>I was raised on government cheese.  I am alive because of foodstamps.  You are arguing with strawman.  I'm all for helping the poor.  We need a safety net, specifically to help children.  However, that doesn't mean that every hippy who hasn't succeeded is the victim of some grand conspiracy where the rich tilt the system in their own favor.<p>Who wants to fix schools?  Schools are corrupt in bad neighborhoods not because they are being sabotaged (they often have very high levels of funding), but because bad neighborhoods have bad parents and a poor PTA, so there is nobody with any incentive to fix the schools that also have the ability and experience to do anything about it.  A poor inner city parent has never seen a school that works, and has never recieved any education to speak of, so they have no idea how to 'fix' their child's school, and most of the time they don't even know that is something they should be concerned about.  Their priorities are all fucked.  How is that the fault of me or anyone else in the 1%?  How is protesting wallstreet in any way related to this?  Your points are all entirely off topic.<p>Health insurance scam them?  What does that have to do with wallstreet?  Seriously, though, if your biggest problem is long term debt, you are pretty fucking rich in absolute terms.  There are people in Africa who's #1 problem is starving to death.  After all, our western legal system is completely friendly to debtors these days, they can have all debts removed (other than student loans) by declaring bankruptcy.<p>It's not my fault people are too stupid to major in a field that will let them pay back their student loans.  The humanities do not lead to jobs, everyone knowns this.  Hell, it's repeated so much it's a cliche!  Blaming other people because you wanted to do an easy major and fuck girls in college while going into debt is an insult to those of us that worked our asses off so that we could make money later.  This is just 'the ant and the grasshopper', don't blame the ant.<p>Actually, I was born into and lived in poverty almost my entire life before the age of 18.  I attended many bad schools, and had no support.  I don't feel exploited at all, in fact I think I'm lucky to live in an age where even the poorest people, who's parents make the worst decisions (drug use, alcohol abuse, child abuse) are able to attend school, and in fact are compelled to.  If you can afford a big screen TV, and you have 500 channels of television, you are not being exploited.  Turn off the TV and do something before you start bitching about how unfair life is.<p>Everyone has access to quality food.  If you are too poor to afford quality food, foodstamps are provided for you and your family.  If you choose to buy McDonalds and cheetos anyway, what then?  Are we supposed to force feed people carrots?  Because that is the only way you'll get many poor people to eat healthy food, by forcing them to.  Is that what you advocate?<p>I think if you turned the anger down, you would see that there isn't a class of evil conspirators at the top.  The solutions to our problems are not clear cut, and you don't have any answers to any of the problems you think you see.  There is no silver bullet to the problems of society, and it takes a lot of time and a lot of lessons to move forward a little bit every generation.",1324853665
3391771,comment,3391547,3391607,14,0,xyzzyz,,,"You're mostly right, I made a similar point few months ago[1].<p>However, I must disagree that we are able to use regular expressions to test for primality all the number we're interested in. Your argument only proves that there <i>exists</i> a regular expression that tests for primality all the numbers below N, where N is arbitratily large. It does not shows any way how to construct it[2], nor does it guarantee that the DFA we will be using to test for primality will fit in available memory.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3046623"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3046623</a><p>[2] - It's actually trivial: example regular expression we're looking for is /a^p_1|a^p_2|...|a^p_N/, where p_1, ..., p_N are primes below. Sadly, to use it to test for primality, we need to know if the number is prime beforehand.<p>Actually, it sounds like an interesting problem -- to come up with an interesting and nontrivial regular expression schema that for every N gives us a regular expression that tests for primeness all numbers less than N.<p>Come to think of it, the existence of any such interesting schema seems highly unlikely -- the Parikh's theorem implies that the set of lengths of words matched by regular expression (or even context-free grammar) seems to be too constrained to allow for such scheme -- we can easily find non-prime matched by an such regular expression, and Parikhs theorem seems to imply that it is not much bigger than the automaton state count.",1324853628

Also, what would be the primary challenges/issues with such a site? What characteristics of the open source movement and community would make this work or not work?<p>I see that Gun.io is trying to do something like this. It doesn't seem to be working very well yet. Not sure that specific implementation of the idea is right. Something feels off.<p>Background of question:\nI was just brainstorming some open source projects that I would like to exist. If I had more time or enough income that I could use some of my income generating time for purposes other than generating income, I would just build these projects. However, because of my life circumstances this is not the case (Early in career, stay at home wife and child, high cost of living, commitments outside of software world, etc...). These ideas are ideas that I believe a lot of other people could make use of and would generate income for many people if built. This got me thinking that it would be cool if I could either chip in a few hundred bucks towards the development of these projects or if I could get paid just enough to build these projects that I could afford the time to build them.<p>Related Side Rant:\nI greatly appreciate the open source communities commitment to donating time for the greater good of the community. I also think that it would be very beneficial to create more tools to further encourage the development of open source projects by compensating the talented engineers that lead the development in order to at a minimum offset the opportunity cost of time spent developing open source. I also think it is fantastic that companies and organizations like Khan Academy, P2PU and many others are attempting to build sustainable organizations based on open sourcing their code.<p>Related Discussions:\nReflections on Using Kickstarter for Open Source Projects - http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2875255\nGun.io Debuts Free Group Funding for Open Source Projects (gun.io) - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3348358",1324852814

I can get a much better computer at half the price if I go with a PC instead""<p>I know people who refuse to purchase soda water in bottles: they only use the SodaStream, as the compressed air cartridges are cheaper (or, more simply, drink flat tap).<p>Everyone knows people who sit around endlessly comparing prices on plane flights on the one hand, while constantly complaining about the decreasing in-flight meal quality on the other.<p>Hell, McDonald's is even trying to take advantage of this by directly attacking Starbuck's where it hurts: they are now selling stronger and more intricate coffee concoctions.<p><a href=""http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/McDonald-s-challenging-Starbucks-with-cheaper-1249371.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/McDonald-s-challen...</a><p>This isn't because these products were introduced too cheaply (I remember when domain names cost $75/year), or even because there are lots of free comparables (people optimize fractions of a percent on their plane tickets).<p>People are simply cheap. If you want to list a reason for it, I'd guess ""short-sighted"": they expect (nigh unto demand) things to be commodity products that aren't.<p>I mean, how many of these people who complain about in-flight meals ask themselves ""how much would I pay for a better meal""? The people I know who ask that question are already drastically different consumers.<p>I went out shopping for a microwave yesterday, reading reviews of the various models, and I see tons of complaints that X model only lasted a year or two.<p>You have to wonder: if a company makes a product for $20 less that starts to fall apart in a year (as it is held together with cheap glue and plastic that wears through), will people actually not buy it?<p>As far as I can tell, people still buy it, and they buy a lot of them (these are the microwaves with the largest numbers of reviews; yes, the ones that don't work even have more positive reviews, as more people are buying them).<p>The incentives that consumers are enforcing on their suppliers simply suck. If people looked into their purchases ahead of time, asking the right questions, and knowing what they are willing to pay for various benefits, these broken products might simply never be made.<p>This is why companies like GoDaddy can exist: charge slightly less than the competition (as people are cheap), make it up in the backend with irritating upsells or by directly selling your personal information.<p>How many people who demand unlimited bandwidth wonder how that business model possibly works? Further, how many of them wonder whether the answer is more complex than ""they have secret caps""?<p>(For the record, the answer is pretty complex, and involves a market where application vendors such as Netflix would normally pay off carriers on the backend to get their apps onto devices; the App Store has disrupted this market.)<p>So, given all of this, we now have to direct our questions to the story of the app developers, to see why they think their situation is so different, and I think this is where it gets good.<p>First off, it isn't in fact the case that people offering cheap goods are making the most money. They have the most downloads, but are not the highest grossing.<p>This became really clear when Apple added a ""top grossing"" category: in the market where everyone was whining that apps ""had to be $1 to sell"", the top app was actually a $50+ GPS navigation app.<p>So really, developers just /think/ they are in a market where no one is willing to buy apps for more than $1, despite even more obvious high-cost examples ($10 apps from EA and PopCap).<p>Why? Honestly, because we have made producing and distributing goods so simple that people who are neither trained nor experienced in the numbers are now dominating it (and certainly are the ones most blogging about it).<p>Airlines hear complaints about pricing (or alternatively, about their meal quality) /constantly/; as does Starbucks, as do movie theaters (as does Apple itself on hardware, btw).<p>However, they don't care. Even if they get 10,000 complaints; /if even if they get more complaints than sales/, these are not lost customers: these are people below their chosen profit point.<p>I seriously see app developers who seem to be optimizing for ""no complaints"". They keep dropping the price point trying to find a place where it becomes a ""no-brainer"" so that ""everyone will buy it"".<p>However, you really need to ask: if you sell it for $10 instead of $1, do you get 1/10th the customers, or simply 1/5th? If the answer is ""1/5th"", you should seriously consider $10.<p>Notice: if you do sell it for $10, and it is really really easy for people to complain or leave feedback (internal rating/commenting systems are really bad at contributing to this), you are going to see /tons/ of complaints.<p>You might even see more complaints than satisfied customers, and you might even see four times as many complaints as you see satisfied customers; and yet, you made twice as much money.<p>This allows you to hire twice as many people, allowing you to make a much better product, allowing you to make more sales at the higher price point... this is how quality products work.<p>Apple has classically had a fraction of the market Dell did, but they had /such a higher margin/ that they could offer all kinds of things that Dell couldn't (such as great service).<p>(Which is also an important point: if you increase your price from $1 to $2, the difference in margin might be much more than ""twice as much"": if Apple sold their iPhone at $170 they'd make no money at all.)<p>Instead, developers self-select themselves into the bargain bin; they are so tied in to their negative feedback (I mean: it really does hurt to get it), that they have a difficult time realizing the positive feedback.<p>What people really need to do is analyze their market, think about what kinds of customers they are targeting (which might very well be ""price conscious consumers""), price their product appropriately, and learn to live with some complaints.",1324852514

These 'better things' are a lot of different things to different people. I know that 'people in Europe' would be satisfied if they could get content in an easy manner and directly. The fact that you buy a book/movie/game on Amazon/apple/whatever and it says 'not available in your region' is prehistoric and simply invites illegal copying. No-one cares about the copyright laws involved with regions; it's inconvenient, so people copy and (a lot of people) buy when it comes out in their region (finally, if it ever does...). But the whole region concept is so out of date that even the notion of it makes all 'piracy' claims laughable in the eyes of most people 'over here'.<p>The claim that if 'companies would make legal buying as easy as copying people would buy more' I think holds a lot of truth. Sure you have people who copy always (they just don't want to pay), but SOPA won't stop that at all, not even a bit. It doesn't stop these people and pisses off people who actually are not opposed to paying but cannot (at the time). There might be other groups, I don't know them.<p>Currently there definitely is nothing 'better' than SOPA in the eyes of the publishers besides what there currently is, and both don't prevent what they want to prevent, but SOPA does cripple the internet, which makes it very wrong. Everyone with a brain SHOULD oppose it.<p>If you know of a 'better' solution, please enlighten me; the 'solutions' so far are based on a lot of work on the side of providers and such and none on the side of publishers while just providing the same content for the same price at the same time all over the world would prevent significantly more than any laws, punishment or filters can (but I know they are trying to postpone that eventuality because they want to make more money artificially (without doing <i>any</i> work) which is exactly the reason they are dinosaurs).",1324851870

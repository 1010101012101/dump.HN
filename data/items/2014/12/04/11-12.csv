8698830,comment,8697772,8697772,0,0,learnstats2,,,"I&#x27;ve worked with several adult learners on this but almost no adult is able to learn math just for fun - unless they have a project or crucial examination to work towards. But, you do have a project. You should use that.<p>I think you&#x27;re mistaken that your existing tactics won&#x27;t get you further. This is how most people learn, by trying things out and building on them until they understand what works and what doesn&#x27;t - standing on the shoulders of giants.<p>For practical purposes, your satisfactory solutions are a great piece of learning and the start of your understanding. You&#x27;re maybe experiencing some discomfort about it, but that&#x27;s normal. Keep going!<p>P.S. You said &quot;from first principles&quot;, which has a specific meaning in math. It&#x27;s a kind of philosophical ideal in math that you start from nothing (forget about high school math) and carefully and precisely build the subject of mathematics on top. Some of the answers here picked up on that phrase, but it probably isn&#x27;t relevant to the other interests you mentioned - to do programming or electronics, you will want to build on the knowledge that you have learned already.",1417694397
8698829,comment,8690206,8692263,0,0,protester,,,"Well, your first line doesn&#x27;t make sense, since the first two comparisons are using type coercion but the third isn&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s like saying `0 == false` but `0 !== false` how can this be? (&quot; &quot; != &quot;&quot; is the same as &quot; &quot; !== &quot;&quot;)<p>The second line at least uses type coercion, but still you are making the wrong assumptions. true could be coerced to many strings &#x27;t&#x27;, &#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;true&#x27;, &#x27;yes&#x27;, &#x27;on&#x27;,  but they chose to use &#x27;1&#x27; (You may not like it but I think it&#x27;s a good choice). Infinity on the other hand has not many choices when coercing it to a string I can think of &#x27;∞&#x27; (which is difficult to type), &#x27;Infinity&#x27;, and maybe &#x27;Inf.&#x27; so I think they made a good choice here.<p>I&#x27;m not saying type coercion in js has no problems, but you said that it&#x27;s a mess and I just think you chose the wrong examples.",1417694396

8698784,comment,8697590,8698480,0,0,roel_v,,,"It&#x27;s called &#x27;cognitive dissonance&#x27;: when two &#x27;cognitions&#x27; (ideas, or feelings, or facts) contradict (are in &#x27;dissonance&#x27;), we feel uneasy, so we resolve the situation by suppressing one cognition. To do so, we usually need to resort to convincing ourselves of what are really logical fallacies or sophisms. E.g. cognition 1: I only buy from companies that are good; cognition two: company I bought from did something bad. Fact is I have something from the company, so the only resolution is: accusation against company is false.<p>An easy way to convince yourself of something that is not rationally true is by evangelism: telling others that yes, this is the best way or greatest thing. The more you repeat it, the more you will believe it yourself.<p>This phenomenon is especially strong with something that people derive identity from, like religion or (especially for juveniles who have not yet developed a complete identity) psychological feelings of affiliation with subcultures revolving around a certain music genre or goods that project a certain lifestyle to others (designers goods like expensive hand bags, shoes or iPhones).",1417693162

Java services? Every. Single. Week. When I get an alert some JBoss unexpectedly died or became unresponsive - &quot;java.lang.OutOfMemoryError&quot; is most likely going to be the problem. A lot of those are permgen space errors, and yes you can try all the &quot;fixes&quot; like increasing the permgenspace, permgensweeping, enabling class unloading, ... but these don&#x27;t always fix the problem and slow down your services. Every time this happened in our own services, this had to be fixed by our developers. It takes weeks to locate the problem, and you end up deploying new versions, upgrading JBoss, JSF, Bouncycastle, ... whatever.<p>After a while dealing with crap like this - you start avoiding projects using the JVM (although elasticsearch is pretty nice)",1417692475

You don&#x27;t wait for a new relase of the standard (C++11, C++14, ...) and for compiler support: if you need to do crazy things with syntax trees, you are welcome. Then you may pulbish it and other people will use your libraries, like it is done for any other libraries in any languages.<p>> they still lead to unreadable code because you can&#x27;t tell what a given piece of code does until you understand which parts are macros and understand all of them<p>So, in order to understand a pice of code, I must: (1) know what is, or isn&#x27;t, a macro, and (2) if it is a macro, know what it does. The same applies for any function: don&#x27;t apply a function if you don&#x27;t know what it does.<p>You can rely on docstrings, macroexpand, as well as live coding techniques (describe, inspect) to help you understand complex operations. But saying that macros make code inherently &quot;unreadable&quot; is not justified: what about monads? do they simplify code or complexify it? like macros, they introduce an abstraction (loop) and can help with consistency (with-open): some people dislike it, because they feel they loose sight of what is &quot;really&quot; happening, but this is not a bad idea by itself.<p>>  But don&#x27;t throw up your hands and let every library rewrite code willy-nilly<p>Strawman: people don&#x27;t really do that.<p>Regarding your example, I really would like to know how typeclasses can be used to solve `(setf (car list) x)`.

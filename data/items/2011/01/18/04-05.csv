I'll concede that it may not be the cause for all the bad developers -- low barrier to entry seems like a much more likely cause, but I do not believe that this field has matured yet.

Or are you going along with the support just because you support his political party?   He has no facts or even scientific support for his statement.  To state that the Australian coal industry has somehow caused major flooding is to indulge in bald-faced lying of the type that only agenda-driven politicians can manage.  The one data point of worse flooding in 1893 before the coal industry even existed is case closed for most rational people.  Not even the most activist climate scientist is prepared to definitively link the floods to warming temperature, let along the percentage of warming attributed to co2 emissions, let alone the 1% of global co2 emissions that Australia accounts for.  About the best you'll get is 'global warming may have contributed to the flooding'.

2114623,comment,2114120,2114227,0,0,brc,,,"Why is it different?<p>Most people in Australia know of the extremes of the place.  So major fires, droughts, floods, storms and cyclones are only a matter of when, rather than if.<p>It's not a 1000 year flood.  These types of things happen at least once every 50 years (plus more frequent minor floods) going back about 170 years to the written history. The major dam built to mitigate (not prevent) flooding arguably might have performed better to lower the peak, but the flood event came after a month of record rainfall, and the dam operators followed the manual given to them.  That might need review for future operations, but it's not like someone did something rash or stupid.<p>Australia is not a place of high social tension, or of high crime.  Brisbane itself is a sunny, peaceful city with a normally benign river winding through the middle.  When a disaster strikes, people are more likely to muck in and help out their less fortunate neighbours than to try and steal their stuff.  Not that looting doesn't happen - some does, but there is plenty of incidents where citizens have interrupted looters and run them out of town.<p>Another feature of Brisbane flooding is that it affects rich and poor equally.  Some of the most expensive houses front the river and have private pontoons (most of which are now in the ocean) - these get flooded.  Some of the poorer areas are built in low-lying land, which also gets flooded.  So it's not a class thing in that only the poor get affected.  Some of the worst hit suburbs are also the most expensive suburbs to live.<p>As to why Australia tends to come together rather than fall apart - well, that would make for a fascinating social study.  Personally I see it enshrined as part of the nations (and especially Queensland) culture - fair go, mateship, sticking together when the chips are down, having strength in adversity.  You can probably explain as much when the most celebrated annual military parade day (Anzac day) commemorates Australia first and greatest military defeat, whereas there are no parades celebrating Australian military victories.<p>Or, to sum up even more succinctly, despite sharing a language and both being previous colonies, Australia and America are fundamentally different countries in many ways.",1295325468

Take your pick, this is to get as many search clicks and/or other data aggregations into Google's hands or to suck the oxygen out of the market from their arch-rival Microsoft, or possibly both.<p>To that end, they give the carriers what the carriers want, and the carriers want to make their captive market miserable.<p>This plays itself out in a myriad of different ways, and it always seems to come down to the same thing: Android is more open in theory, but the gap between theory and practice is smaller in theory than it is in practice, and the cause of the gap is the carriers and Googles perfectly sane business strategy of appeasing them.<p>I am not saying Apple's strategy is better or worse than Google's. It is possible that each strategy is a local optimum, and the poor companies between Apple and Google--like Microsoft, RIM, and so on--are between a rock and a hard place.<p>But I do think each strategy is valid given its company's goals, and therefore I do not expect to see anything change unless there is a seismic shift in the industry.

A month is enough time to begin to get a feel for a language and its idioms, and being able to think and solve problems in different ways will make you a much better programmer even if you do end up working mostly in one or two languages.<p>Learning how to learn a programming language quickly is also an exceptionally useful skill. New languages don't scare me any more--I can usually learn enough to start hacking on something in a couple of hours, and enough to not be writing completely horrible code in a couple of days. And it's now very rare that I sit down to read a piece of code and can't figure out what's happening because I'm not familiar with the language, which is very helpful when I need to work on something I've never seen before.<p>That all said, there's a reason I didn't continue doing that indefinitely. Learning one or two languages really well is also very important.",1295323998

All illustrate how our usage and the meanings of our words have been modified over time.<p>A driveway is a section of personal roadway that leads to a personal garage (you would never have left one of the old 70% wooden cars outside with zero rust proofing on the metal, ever). A parkway was supposed to be a scenic roadway to link urban and suburban parks with pleasure roads where people could park freely and enjoy the area, now it's commonly a synonym for any general highway. Freeways were actually speed-limit-free highways, the 'free' never had anything to do with cost until the very late 20th century. An expressway was designed as a high-speed arterial road, which may have a limited number of driveways.",1295323975

Apple just makes a developers job so much easier, an iOS dev is safe to get excited about new features, because they can count on them being supported by customers devices almost immediately.<p>One of the big advantages android has is the lack of app approval. However if curated stores like amazon take off and users prefer it  android will loose that advantage too.<p>From a users perspective it is great to know you can get 3 years of new features out of an iPhone vs ???

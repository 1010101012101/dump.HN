Views (which wrap DOM elements) keep track of their position and size, so we never have to ask the DOM. We defer DOM manipulations to the end of each ""run loop"" where we coalesce them, removing redundant operations.<p>The overhead of this bookkeeping (which is reduced by increase JS engine performance) is less than the overhead of extra DOM operations, so it's worth it.<p>We're already seeing other frameworks adopt some of these practices.",1223416751

326112,comment,325775,325995,0,0,ChaitanyaSai,,,"Ah, well, I studied at an IIT too, (Madras [Ganga] 98-02 shoutout! :) ) and I do agree that the pressure to jump  examination hurdles is rather intense, but this again is a case of striving for very conventional goals, and for a limited period of time.<p>How many have kept up the effort, after getting through (or not)?<p>As I said before, a conventional trajectory passing through a marriage in the mid-twenties, is also one that makes the uptake of risk (and consequently effort) much harder in life. I keep bringing up risk because effort without the possibility of significant success is rather pointless. And without risky opportunities that afford that kind of success, people reach for the cruise control after just-enough.<p>Malthusian scarcity should reward and select for effort, ( and also voluntary birth control and later marriage) as it did in the period right before Industrial England (([1] ; descriptive review: [2])), but, in India, it strangely doesn't!  Predestiny, passivity, and fatalism, all predate socialist India. Our mythology reflects this.<p>I do agree that we are turning a new chapter and we are host to a whole new set of cultural ideas, but the numbers aren't, unfortunately, high enough. Yes, while about 300 million people, are (or were in 2001) technically urban, 50 million are slum dwellers; I'd wager that only a tiny slice is literate enough to accept cultural transmissions.<p>Still, I hope that this tiny slice of a humongous pie proves to be big enough....<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Alms-Economic-History-Princeton/dp/0691121354"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Alms-Economic-History-Princet...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/science/07indu.html?pagewanted=print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/science/07indu.html?pagewa...</a>",1223416195

326087,comment,326012,326012,0,0,rcoder,,,"First, you should know that many types of caching will <i>increase</i> your memory usage, not decrease it. The whole point of a cache is to use fast storage (RAM) to keep a local copy of data that would be slower to retrieve from its persistent source (filesystem or DB).<p>Second, 384 MB just isn't much memory for a medium-traffic Drupal site. I would recommend at least a gig of memory, and perhaps more if you use plugins heavily. Drupal is neither particularly lean nor blazingly fast, so you're going to need a lot of Apache listeners working to handle that load, with each process probably consuming 30-50 MB of RAM.<p>Third, you're right to think that you need someone on-call who knows Apache, Drupal, and database tuning and configuration inside and out. A $60/mo. support package isn't going to do it, though. If you think about it, that's really only paying for an hour or two of tech time each month, so expecting to get 24/7 interactive performance tuning and optimization for free along with your support contract is pretty unreasonable. Put a performance guru on retainer, and establish an SLA with them if necessary to maintain your site uptime.<p>Finally, opening >30 tickets in less than a week is not the best way to get quality support. It's like the stereotypical impatient kid on a road trip, asking ""are we there yet?"" over and over again.<p>My suggestion would be for your to find an experienced LAMP admin who is willing to manage your hosting for you, and pay them a reasonable fee for doing so.",1223414384

326076,comment,326012,326012,0,0,jbyers,,,"From what you've said, I doubt host swapping is a good idea - yet.  First you need to get a good understanding of what's causing the system to run out of memory.  One way to do this is to watch vmstat and top when the system is failing, or to install one of many system monitoring packages.<p>From what you've stated, I'll take a stab at what's going on.  Apache processes are big, from a memory usage standpoint.  A single Apache + mod_php could use 25 MB or more.  If you have a dozen or more requests that hit at once -- or processes that are feeding slow clients -- blam, you've run out of memory.<p>One solution is to switch to lighttpd, nginx, or another webserver with a smaller footprint.  Here a single process (or small set) serves a pool of PHP processes.  But that's a bunch of work for a guess at what's going wrong.<p>Instead, try running nginx as a proxy in front of Apache, and let it spoonfeed slow clients.  It's likely you will not need to change Drupal at all, and make only minor changes to Apache to do this.

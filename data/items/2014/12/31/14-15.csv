To cut a long story short, I&#x27;d just finished implementing a new piece of functionality and I logged on to the app to test it.  The application started behaving very unexpectedly.  I double-checked my code, but couldn&#x27;t see anything that make it act the way it did.  Then I tried logging on as a different user, et voila!  It worked!  Tried the old user and the problem occurred again.  Tried a 3rd user and I got different behaviour again, but not the same as with the original user I was testing with.  I thought it had to be a data issue, so I uninstalled the application and cleared the cache and app data, reinstalled, and the bug was gone.  Whatever I tried I could not replicate the problem.  I shrugged it off as local database corruption and continued working.<p>A few days later, the same thing happened.  Same symptoms,  but this time the bug disappeared without me even having to reinstall the app.  After a few hours of frustrating debugging and source code reviews, I remembered something.  I ran into the problem at the same time of the morning as I did before - around 12am.  It turns out that the process that populates the server with daily product information that usually ran at 11pm was rescheduled to run at 12am (we weren&#x27;t informed about this change).  It ran for 5 to 8 mins.  At the time I logged on, the data for the first user was not available yet, but the data for the second user was.  To complicate things, if the server can&#x27;t find daily product information for that day, it sends data from the previous week (the products are essentially the same, but the quantities may be slightly different and the IDs are tied to older stock batches).  But the user I was testing with didn&#x27;t exist 7 days ago so he didn&#x27;t have data to fall back on.  The 3rd user&#x27;s daily product data also wasn&#x27;t available yet, but he did exist 7 days ago so he received data with product IDs that I did not expect.<p>In the end I &quot;fixed&quot; the problem using a scheduled task that emailed tech support if the product data was not in our databases by 11:30pm.",1420036587

We are bootstrapping and the electric heat the building has is much more expensive per BTU than oil/gas.<p>Black aluminum foil will reach 156F in direct sunlight in December in Southeast Connecticut. I have read that black aluminum foil will convert 88% of light to heat. We have 50 square feet of these panels that spend every clear or partly cloudy day between 130-156F, warming the building through convection. On a clear day with an outside temperature of 27F our rig heats two floors to 61F. We are going to add another 50 sq. ft. of panels to attempt to reach 70F+<p>And the heat mass of the building keeps it warm for four hours after the sun sets. We have some large floor to ceiling windows and we installed the panels so they stand behind the bottom three feet of some of the south-southeast facing windows.<p>The total cost of our system was $94 and a couple hours of time.<p>If we owned the building I would install solar hot air panels (basically an insulated rectangular box with a plexiglass top and black aluminum foil tacked into the inside with an intake and exhaust) and run a couple air ducts into the building.<p>This building already had a solar hot water heating system, with two 4&#x27; x 8&#x27; water heating panels on the roof. This gives us much of our hot water.<p>We are awash in solar energy, and heating air with the sun is the cheapest and most efficient way of capturing it. Solar hot air is THE low hanging fruit of solar power.<p>The only downside with our system is that there is no energy storage. But that could be engineered easily. A concentrated solar trough connected to a buried large cement block or other heat sink could easily store a day or two worth of heat for night time and cloudy days.<p>55% of the days here are clear or partly cloudy and great for solar heating.<p>Update:<p>If you were wondering what we are doing in Southeast CT,  we are participating in the first of what we are calling The Winter Startup Challenge, our own laid back, low burn rate version of Y Combinator.<p>My team rented a waterfront three bedroom house in a beach community for the offseason, October-May.

The entire existence of the state API is a highly visible example of this.<p>It reminds me a lot of Gabriel&#x27;s divide between the New Jersey approach versus the MIT approach---React is far more viral in its current form, but better technology certain lives further down the path.<p>I went to the Boston React meetup a few nights ago to hear Pete Hunt speak about React. He was a wonderful speaker and described nicely how React learned some of the same lessons that REST did making it superior to basic message passing and bloated/leaky distributed object mechanisms (blech). He also projected a very pragmatic POV from the React dev team---they want things to be right, but they also want things to be functional in the perspective of the way most applications are built today.<p>I was eager and jumped on some of the problems he suggested the React time was facing trying to integrate something like animation into React. At this point we jump from a sequence of instantaneous updates to a more game-like continuous redraw effort. Pete mentioned that the current effort here was to try to use technology like RxJS observers to get more reactivity and this seems aligned with the OP here.<p>Personally, I think animation lives most nicely in the domain of continuous time, &quot;true&quot; FRP which is mostly ignored by the current wave of Javascript FRP libraries. Perhaps for good reason since most modern implementations ideas of (again, &quot;true&quot;) FRP are challenging to implement efficiently and the semantic model is probably far too large (Zeno processes, difficulty with infinitesimal delay).<p>But the advantage of FRP is that you can specify things like animation independently of the icky details like event passing and sampling rate and let those be determined at a later time when your FRP eDSL gets compiled into a more refined event-passing network. In other words, FRP languages hide a vast number of irrelevant and muddying details in a way that has a consistent denotation and can (perhaps!) be compiled efficiently into a push/pull message passing network.",1420035412

8819389,comment,8818533,8818533,0,0,sargun,,,"I have a different view on security. A lot of people are talking about defense in depth, and security being enforced by the network. I think although that kind of works, it&#x27;s largely a mistake. Security, as enforced by middleboxes is fundamentally flawed, especially as we see the proliferation of systems that are too complex, and rapidly changing for middleboxes to understand. Although, they can be a tool in laying defensive trenches, they are nothing more than a simple barrier.<p>I think that endpoint security is what needs to be enhanced. Looking at what&#x27;s been disclosed about malware recently (APTs: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat</a>), we need to focus on a few things:<p>1) Isolating components: Components, and processes themselves should be isolated from one another, and the operating system. A web server should be able to run malicious code without fear of it easily getting root access. We have tools to make this possible today, like Apparmor, and SELinux. The fact that distributing Apparmor, or SELinux profiles with applications today isn&#x27;t normal, makes me sad.<p>2) Modularization: We should do our best to split the components of a system up into small, well-understood pieces. Rather than trying to combine multiple components into one monolithic process, breaking up components into their individual components. I think Cloudflare&#x27;s work around Keyless SSL was great, but we&#x27;ve had HSMs for years -- that could have easily avoided such disasters as Heartbleed.<p>3) Decent abstractions: With the advent of further distributed systems, and modularization, we&#x27;re going to see more and more interfaces between systems crop up. Largely, CISOs are limited to what the systems, and networking team can do. These limits typically manifested themselves at layer 4 on the network side of the house, and limited layer 7 capabilities like URL filtering, and file system ACLs. I think we need better stories around resource access and authorization. For years, we&#x27;ve had systems like Kerberos which would have been a great building block, but yet goes unused. I hope we see X509, and GPG become more ubiquitous for access management, and encryption.",1420035035

As long as you have big enough drinking water tanks to handle the occasional weather related or maintenance related you&#x27;re golden.<p>For example, if you have tanks big enough to hold a week or so of drinking water, then as long as you produce more than a weeks drinking water per week, you&#x27;re all good.<p>This applies to almost any process that requires energy that is either a long term average or you can store in a tank.  Electro-refining copper (good luck keeping aluminum cells warm, lol) or pumping irrigation water into fields.  I would imagine you can solar distill ethanol whenever you feel like it, more or less.  Given big enough tanks, you could generate chlorine for anything from swimming pool size to municipal water system size.  A country needs X megatons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer per season and yes all of it is made today from natgas, but you could theoretically make it from solar power, air, and water, as long as the long term average power generated is high enough to make enough fertilizer per year.<p>Some industries like aluminum refining and some chemical plant work have a batch or shutdown time longer than the average weather related issue, so for basic chemistry scientific reasons they&#x27;re screwed and will always require coal powered electricity, but most others theoretically only need a couple minutes of UPS power to shut down.  Because electrical power is now super cheap, there are industries that have not put the slightest engineering effort on it... think CNC machinery, where there&#x27;s no scientific reason a machine can&#x27;t enter &quot;sleep mode&quot; within seconds, and return to work in seconds after sleeping, although in practice no one has ever made or shipped a machine like that, that I know of.  As a simple example there are very few gcode programs that don&#x27;t involve a dwell or toolchange where it could simply sleep in the middle of it, aside from the more difficult task of interrupting a cut. I guess this is an awesome industrial startup idea, not just for CNC machines but numerous other industrial machines. (And edited to add, there are numerous 3rd world areas overseas and California where the coal powered electric grid is totally unreliable, and machines that respond cooperatively to power interruptions would be quite handy even if there&#x27;s no solar or wind generation involved.)<p>The biggest challenge to solar powering those industries is going to be non-renewable energy is very cheap compared to long term capital costs, so if its cheaper to run on diesel than to let it sit while continuing to paying the bank loan, or if your competitors can out produce you because they&#x27;re not sunlight limited, then they&#x27;ll have to run on diesel or coal-based electricity for financial department reasons, even if its no engineering challenge at all to run on intermittent solar power.",1420034959

Every book I&#x27;ve ever seen on network design and system administration talks about &quot;departmental&quot; servers and segmenting corporate networks at functional borders, but in practice I&#x27;ve never seen it. It&#x27;s hard enough to get people to use different network shares for different data (e.g. personal, departmental, project related) instead of one global, world-writable share. This occurs at every level, from small businesses to the largest corporate and government networks.<p>On top of that, even if you compartmentalize, there really isn&#x27;t any technical method to prevent Sally in HR from emailing a list of personal email addresses, phone numbers and addresses to Sam in the Communications department so he can send out Christmas cards to everyone. And, Sally being a non-technical user will probably just &quot;hide&quot; the social security and salary columns in that spreadsheet instead of deleting them and then will blame Bob in IT when that list of salaries ends up on the global network share and eventually printed out and taped to the wall in the hallway.",1420034637
8819357,comment,8813208,8813841,0,0,dep_b,,,"There is no reason not to use Swift, Swift can do all that Objective-C can do and more. The language, framework support and the compiler have reached 1.0, the only thing that keeps happening is an error message in Xcode that I can safely ignore and keep working. But projects written in Swift are safe for production.<p>The reason you could switch to Swift is that it is safer, less verbose (<i>unless you interact with Objective-C</i>) and more flexible. You can choose to use Swift in a way that you are just using Objective-C translated to Swift and ignore all the extras or you can choose to use all the extra goodies you get like map, reduce, currying, advanced switch case statements and more. These features aren&#x27;t new but they are not common in a lower level language comparable to C++ and Objective-C.<p>Swift is comparable to Rust in that sense. Nobody <i>needed</i> Rust but Rust doesn&#x27;t stop you from doing anything you could do before while it gives you a lot of extra goodies from higher level languages.<p>A lot of people tried Swift when it was in a beta and ran into problems with it and got frustrated. Then repeat those experiences all over the internet like it happened to them just yesterday. There&#x27;s also a significant portion of the iOS development community that rejects AutoLayouts because it was too alien to them and the first iteration wasn&#x27;t perfect.<p>Last but not least: you&#x27;re not forced to use only Swift in any project. Of course it&#x27;s easier to wrap C code in Objective-C and then use it with a bridge in your Swift project. I mix and match every day, I&#x27;m not going to rewrite perfectly sane Objective-C code because I&#x27;m doing a Swift project. Try to be pragmatic about it.<p>Truth is that Objective-C style libraries really do seem really cumbersome and verbose when you use it in much more lightweight Swift code.",1420034590

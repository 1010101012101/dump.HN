If your answer is anything but yes, then it&#x27;s a fact that corruption is a part of nature, much like thunderstorms or a sun rise.<p>> But what reason do you have to say that it can&#x27;t be solved?<p>Because it&#x27;s inherent to our nature. Can you stop people from loving one another? Do you think that&#x27;s possible? If your answer is anything but &quot;Yes&quot;, then you have your answer on corruption. It&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> the same thing. Trying to eliminate something that humans have been doing since our existence isn&#x27;t something that can be solved with naive optimism.<p>The answer isn&#x27;t to eliminate, but to mitigate and minimize its effects. It&#x27;s very similar to the war on drugs. You&#x27;re never going to stop people from doing drugs, so you work to minimize their usage - legalize it and regulate it so you can minimize the damage.",1420286311

Some of those may be holding BTC as an &quot;investment&quot; and may be unwilling to part with it. Depending on how they hold their BTC, there may be significant friction involved in spending it, ie. in almost all cases I expect it&#x27;s more difficult than entering PayPal or credit card details.<p>And as you note, it&#x27;s not like people are super eager to donate using other methods.

It costs you nothing to post a BTC address on a site, especially if you&#x27;re already handling BTC. There is no interaction with payment providers and all that jazz. There are no immediate fees.

Yes, Park Chung Hee was from South East (Kyongsang) region. Kim Dae Jung was from South West (Jeolla) region. PCH tried to have KDJ killed many times for his pro-North views and viola, KDJ becomes president in 1998, billions of slush funds travel to Kim Jong Il despite the warnings from US, Kim jong il tests a nuclear weapon 5 years later, KDJ wins the nobel prize. This is why he is mocked in Korea, he traded the security of his country for a fucking medal. The fundings continue when Roh Moo Hyun executes his predecessor&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Policy&quot;. Of course, KDJ and RMH were popular presidential candidates in South West because of promises of economic development PCH completely neglected (the prejudice against Jeolla region was far more blatant back then).<p>As you know Park Chung Hee was assassinated by his own intelligence director in fall of 1979 causing a major state of chaos. General Chun Doo Hwan seized power eventually. The timing of the Gwangju Uprising or Gwangju Rebellion is really peculiar as Chun had just begun to seize complete power after 7 months since the tragedy of PCH. A strong response was the only way to stabalize the country as there are reports that it was instigated by North Korean sleeper agents based on first hand accounts. The official case leaves this out but North Korean defectors admitted that North Korean agents in South Korea were placed strategically in cities to instigate armed rebellion should conditions allow it. Lot of pieces are missing with the official version that Gwangju civilians ran into a cache of guns and ammunition but they leave out the first hand reports that the people handing out the guns had a different dialect one that was closer to North Korea. This explains why an Air Force commandos, the military response because they were responding to a rebellion instigated by a foreign enemy country. We see this happening today in Crimea, Donetsk by Russia.<p>You might have heard that recently, a South Korean lawmaker (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_South_Korean_sabotage_plot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_South_Korean_sabotage_plot</a>) was known to have been leading a similar armed saboteur group called RO (Revolutionary Organization) to assist North Korea in the case of a war by assassinating various figures, attacking vital infrastructure. The evidence against them was overwhelming including recordings and informants. He is sentenced to 12 years in prison.<p>총풍 사건, the &quot;gun wind affair&quot; was blown wildly out of proportion and is a popular topic for left wing elements to use in their arguments but in reality it was found to be groundless accusation and the presidential candidate would try to run for office 10 years later after winning a large defamation lawsuit.<p>I am Korean btw, and shame on you for attacking me and being flagkilled earlier. If you want to sound convincing please keep it civilized.",1420283587

To wit: illumos, FreeBSD, ZFS on Linux, OpenZFS on OS X. So what about all the other distributions out there, e.g. OpenIndiana?<p>Like I said: Fragmentation.<p>What are the odds that any two of the plethora of distributions are using the same ZFS bits? Which bugs are fixed in which distribution? Which post-Sun features are enabled in which distribution?<p>2) The PDF mentions ZFS panics and disk corruption, &quot;a dark time&quot; about a year ago. Fortuitously &quot;Matt Ahrens and George Wilson diagnosed the problem&quot;.<p>Great! One of the inventors of ZFS and one of the ZFS tech leads from Sun were available. But what about if the average user has a problem? Maybe you can give us Matt&#x27;s phone number? Is he available for pro bono consulting when Joe Sixpack has a problem?<p>I&#x27;d love to believe in ZFS. But it seems to me that, right now, it&#x27;s only usable when supported by a big player. It&#x27;s probably great if I go to Joyent and sign up for the Manta Storage Service.

For example the glibc log function, which is often the dominant cost in a lot of sampling algorithms, is about 2.5x slower than a straightforward implementation (ie no fancy SIMD tricks) of Tang&#x27;s 25 year old table lookup algorithm, which is accurate to 0.57 ulps.

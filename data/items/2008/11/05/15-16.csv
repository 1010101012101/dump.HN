So, when they become larger, Microsoft gets money from them.<p>As someone who works at a non-profit, we get Microsoft stuff for next to nothing.

So the people in cities where it is cheap to offer phone service have been paying high bills to subsidize low rates for people in the country.""""""<p>The original rationale for this was to help spread telephone service to those parts of the country where it was more expensive to build out. This actually made sense since phones are much less useful if significant portions of the population don't have access to them. That this policy outlived it's usefulness to the extent it did is somewhat surprising.",1225900000

Or maybe if, as a VC, the author could offer some kind of insight that might be relevant to HN readers.

You (I hope) have statistics on who uses your site you can see if a significant part of your community uses IE6. If it's less than 10% maybe you could consider running an upgrade message, if it isn't suck it up.<p>Posts like this that try to generalise the web together are nonsense. They can suggest trends, but then Yahoo still supports IE6 and they have a pretty large % of the web using Yahoo.com.<p>Mostly it seems like a bunch of people moaning because Web development is hard. That's true. IE6 does not make me happy, that's not an excuse to shaft users. If CIO magazine can give CIOs a compelling reason to upgrade all their legacy machines, now that is something I'd like to read about.",1225899525

In government especially, and as President of the United States, its critical that you surround yourself with intelligent people.  The President is not the sole authority and there is no way one person could handle all that.  It's important that you surround yourself with ""the best in the business.""  In all fairness, it works much the same in business.  As a founder/owner and CEO, its important to surround yourself at that level with qualified people to manage the technology, to manage capital, etc.",1225899390

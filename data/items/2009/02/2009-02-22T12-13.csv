490576,comment,489077,490429,0,0,weavejester,,,"I think you're missing the point. In your workflow, you create the branch <i>before</i> you started work on your new feature. In my Git example, I created the branch retroactively.<p>If you were to attempt the same feat in SVN, it would get a little messy. You'd have to first roll back the repo:<p><pre><code>    svn merge -r HEAD:96 http://server/my_repo
    svn commit -m ""Reverted last 4 commits""
</code></pre>
Then create the branch and merge in the previous commit:<p><pre><code>    svn copy ./my_code ./my_new_feature
    svn merge http://server/my_repo/my_code@100 my_new_feature
    svn commit -m ""Imported reverted commits to new_feature""
</code></pre>
Then make your changes:<p><pre><code>    svn commit -m ""Fixed bug""
</code></pre>
Then merge your change into the new branch:<p><pre><code>    cd ../new_feature
    svn merge -c HEAD ../my_code
    svn commit -m ""Merged bug fix""
</code></pre>
And once you've done all that, your commit history looks like:<p><pre><code>    A
    B
    C
    D
    Reverted last 4 commits
    Imported reverted commits to new_feature
    Fixed bug
    Merged bug fix
</code></pre>
Whilst in Git:<p><pre><code>    Fixed bug   <- master
    A
    B
    C
    D           <- new_feature
</code></pre>
Now, obviously you'd never actually do all this in SVN if you were sensible, but that's exactly my point. The Git concept of a branch being a reference to a commit is more flexible than the SVN idea of a branch being akin to a directory. Things that are perfectly natural to do in Git are rather more complex to do in SVN, and leave behind a messy history of merges.",1235306673

You'll only have the data you need now when you're operating for a long enough time that you have seen several full account life cycles so that you can refine your predictions.<p>Your nearest competitor isn't going to be much help to you because for one they are established, and secondly they may do a much better / much worse job at retaining their users.<p>Every web site will start off great at launch time because there is nobody leaving (yet).

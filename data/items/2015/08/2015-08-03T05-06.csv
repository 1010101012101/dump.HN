And if they do they will probably try to screw you on the terms so you walk away with nothing (or needing serious $$$ in savings that you can exercise your option or lose it) - search HN for all the gory examples of that. And even if you get all that right they&#x27;ll probably fail anyway and you will end up with nothing. Not being negative just very realistic.<p>I agree with the statements about learning something. This can either be technically interesting or about the startup life and strategies so you can learn from their mistakes when you start your own.",1438581583

These firms seem to feel they are entitled to relaxed immigration policy as well, and that wages collusion should be BAU if they don&#x27;t get their way - yet it&#x27;s entitled to think that a company should train an employee to do the job they want them to do?<p>Keep in mind that we&#x27;re not talking about teaching people computer science in the abstract, or turning non-technical people into engineers. People applying for programming jobs should be able to demonstrate some level of <i>general</i> competence of course. But if your HR department has a laundry list of keywords it is pattern-matching CVs against, with the result that many eminently-qualified candidates are dismissed without so much as a phone call or even a Codility screen or whatever, then you either need to take another look at in-house training or quit the constant bleating about a shallow talent pool.",1438581237

Where and to whom you were born is highly determinative of economic success, but clearly it is 100% luck and not skill.<p>Also consider how much of success is due to others. Consider Walmart, for a simple example. How much of the following did Sam Walton build himself?:<p>* Infrastructure: Roads, train tracks, airports, etc. for transporting the goods he sells<p>* The technology of that infrastructure: Who invented and developed automobiles, trains, airplanes, refrigeration, electric lighting (so logistics can operate at night), conveyor belts, electrical generation and distribution, IT, etc.<p>* The development of the human resources: The education that makes his workers literate and skilled to do their jobs: The schools, the teachers, the concepts, the textbooks, pencils, chalkboards ... we could even say language, mathematics, etc.<p>* The system of laws and government that protect his business and allow it to operate efficiently (e.g., via contracts, dispute resolution, etc.).<p>That&#x27;s just a small sample of what Walmart depends on, that Sam Walton did nothing to provide. Sam Walton, and many others, built something very impressive and far more than probably anyone reading this, but it amounts to a sliver on top of a massive infrastructure built up by generations before him. He, like the rest of us, needs to contribute his share and build for the next generation, just like all who came before him.",1438580052

Your focus is on the people &#x27;right at the bottom&#x27;, as is the focus of many who engage in this kind of debate. I tend to look at the whole picture: Those at the bottom, working class salarymen and women in the middle, innovators at the top, middle-class employees who want to become entrepreneurs and job creators and those at the bottom who want to do the same.<p>I&#x27;m a South African immigrant to the United States. I&#x27;ve lived in the UK and worked there for 5 years. I&#x27;ve also lived in France for a year, spent 8 months in Brazil and have family there, lived in the US for over a decade and been an employee, startup founder and now executive. I&#x27;ve traveled extensively. My first real job was scraping a harbor crane boom down to the metal and painting it while covered in metal dust, paint and solvent - and for a wage that makes minimum wage in the USA look like a kings ransom.<p>So I have been at the bottom, I&#x27;ve been a low level techie in a laser printer repair company, I&#x27;ve been a top tier developer and I&#x27;ve starved while starting a company. I&#x27;ve also created a company that creates jobs for others and that is continuing to do so.<p>I think you and I and the rest of the readers see that click-baity blog post for what it is. At least I hope you do. It&#x27;s a sample of one and is rather opinionated.<p>The Swiss have their issues too - I&#x27;ve already mentioned xenophobia - add to that harboring tax evaders, banning the building of mosques (minaret controversy), banning asylum seekers from entering public places in certain towns, and a long complicated history of putting money before morals. But the Swiss and their country are not what I take issue with.<p>My issue is that I&#x27;m tired of the constant whining drum beat that the USA is so bloody awful and we should look at place X, Y or Z as a shining light of how amazing things could be.<p>I&#x27;m 41 and I&#x27;ve been around the World and around the block a few times. Trust me when I tell you that the difference between developing countries and the USA is staggering in terms of personal security, quality of life, healthcare (Yup. Just look at the number of CT/PET scan machines and speed of diagnosis of fast moving diseases like cancer) and opportunity. What this means is that the USA is doing a hell of a lot better at creating an awesome quality of life than most of the rest of the World. So cherry picking a prosperous country and suggesting that the USA is a disaster is absurd.<p>Sure, you want cake instead of bread, but both do a really great job of feeding you and most of your brethren around the World have neither. So lets cut the debate, enjoy your bread, open a bakery, employ your brothers and sisters and then do it all over again.<p>This country really is the land of the free because we get to publicly and loudly speak our minds and explore new ideas without persecution. [I grew up under horrible censorship during Apartheid]. It&#x27;s the land of the brave because it&#x27;s filled with innovators who go broke multiple times (like I did) before they earn the privilege of creating jobs, paying more tax and creating useful things. And believe it or not, many of the 1% that are so hated by such a small but very vocal minority in the USA take huge risks with their own money to help fund other entrepreneurs who want to bet everything on creating a business. And those investors do it with incredible empathy and generosity in my experience.<p>So I say again: I&#x27;m tired of these vitriolic attacks on this country, the so called &#x27;one percent&#x27; and on businesses who are run by real human beings. Damn right we&#x27;re far from perfect and there is a lot we can improve upon.

It was an embedded system where someone got the idea to create bitfield access to a cpu register.<p>The problem was that some bits in that register would be cleared automatically each time, so even if you wrote 0 it would read back as 1 the next time. Some other bit would always trigger an action if you wrote to it regardless if you wrote the same value as it had before, this was called the send_bit and when you wrote 0 it sent some stuff onto the network cable. So code that looked perfectly fine like this:<p><pre><code>    register.bitsa = 0x2;
    register.bitsb = 0x1;
    register.send_bit = 0.
</code></pre>
Actually sent 3 packets instead of 1 because the compiler translated each write of a bitfield member to a write of the whole register, some other bits in bitsa could get corrupted by the bitsb-write since they didn&#x27;t read back as they were written. I assume the cpu had a minimum addressable unit of 8 bits so the compiler had to translate each line into something like register = (register | setbits) & clearbits; which requires reading the previous value each time just to write a single bit, this is very easy to overlook when you just see the three lines of code being written in a neat sequence.",1438579243

In almost all other scenarios, you&#x27;ll end up worse off because you will be able to demand a higher salary post-graduation.<p>In terms of skills garnered, it probably will accelerate your technical skills, but you will miss out on the opportunity to solidify your network at school (which takes time) and to graduate with your class.

What makes the draw to startups so strong that you want to leave school to do it?

If you&#x27;re really into the startup life, my advice would be to build a business while you have college as a safety net, then drop out once you have ramen profitability.

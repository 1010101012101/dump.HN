Books are not written on debugging only on learning how to code.<p>I worked for a community college as a student worker, and I worked in a computer lab and debugged the student&#x27;s programs. I learned as many languages as I could. The teachers/professors could not debug the programs so they gave them to me to debug for them.<p>If you take a MOOC or go to a Programming Bootcamp they don&#x27;t teach you how to debug. They teach you how to code.<p>Debugging is part of a quality control process that isn&#x27;t taught but should be taught. In a business management only cares about how much time it takes to finish a project and doesn&#x27;t care if the code is buggy. It used to be an issue of writing bug free code when computers were slower and has less memory but since RAM is cheap and computers are faster now bugs that usually slowed down programs don&#x27;t matter anymore.<p>I was known for my debugging skills, could alter algorithms so they ran faster, could fix memory leaks so programs uses less RAM, would set up buffers to speed up database access etc. But it took extra time to do those sort of things. Management kept cutting the deadlines for completing projects where it wasn&#x27;t possible to debug code anymore. Fix it later, ship buggy code and let the users reboot their PCs when they have a problem.<p>You find so many programmers these days that don&#x27;t know how to debug the code, because they were never taught how. So it is full of security holes, runs slow, has memory leaks, slow database connections, but it is good enough in that it compiles without errors and can be shipped.<p>I became a dinosaur around 2003, nobody wanted to hire a debugger anymore. Sloppy code was in, managed code was out.",1448513880

By controlling the temperature (i.e. avoiding unintentional too-high-temp excursions), you get longer lifetime. Plus we start with a thicker/heavier cast aluminum base than you may be used to on low-end non-stick pans. This reduces hot spots and uneven thermal expansion which both contribute to relatively shorter working lifetimes of low-end cookware.<p>2) We get delicious browned crusts on steaks etc in roughly the 380-420 degree F surface temperature range. You get a nice controlled browned crust, rather than a fully black crust. IMHO this is way better!",1448513743

Yes, the price could be higher, but probably will be lower than the merchant&#x27;s (and therefore, Amazon&#x27;s) price. They do this by sacrificing part of their commission the merchant pays Jet, and giving it to the customer instead.<p>They even have ways for the merchant to choose the same thing, for example, if the customer opts out of free returns, the merchant can pass a percentage along to the customer. Amazon can&#x27;t get upset about that, because even though their MFN clause requires promotions to be consistent across platforms, there is a loophole in the case of Amazon tech stack not supporting the type of promotion being offered.

Worse, imperfect attempts at this can easily be abused by evil people to harm innocents. Therefore our legal system sticks to the only thing it can reliably measure - outcomes, sprinkling in some consideration for intent when the latter is obvious.<p>In a perfect world, we could probably also separate compensating victims from punishing the perpetrators. If I steal and wreck your car to save my wife who needs to get to the hospital ASAP, then in a perfect world I should go free and pay exactly nothing, but <i>you</i> should get a new car (or monetary equivalent) plus some reasonable opportunity costs compensation. Who would pay? The society, out of &quot;shit happens&quot; fund. But to work, this again would require probing intent, in order to avoid turning stealing cars into a replacement for taxi service.

They appear once you understand there are no single pair of logic gates in the world that are exactly equal. Every logic gate is slightly slower or faster than the others, even in the same chip. This leads to every level change to be discrete in time, and never exactly aligned with others, which leads to glitches.<p>Silly example:\nLet&#x27;s imagine we are implementing the logic operation A OR (NOT A), which should be 1 always. We implement it as an OR gate with two inputs. On the first input we put A through a buffer. On the second input we put A through a NOT gate. Now let&#x27;s switch A from 0 to 1. One of these two sequences of events will happen:<p>Sequence 1:<p>0. Nothing has happened yet. The OR gate has 0,1 on its inputs. Output=1.<p>1. The buffer sets its output to 1. The OR gate has 1,1 on its inputs. Output=1.<p>2. The NOT gate sets its output to 0. The OR gate has 1,0 on its inputs. Output=1<p>During all the sequence the output has been 1, so everything is fine.<p>Sequence 2:<p>0. Nothing has happened yet. The OR gate has 0,1 on its inputs. Output=1.<p>1. The NOT gate sets its output to 0. The OR gate has 0,0 on its inputs. Output=0<p>2. The buffer sets its output to 1. The OR gate has 1,0 on its inputs. Output=1.<p>Did you see it? During a split-second the output was 0, even though theoretically it should have been 1 all the time. That&#x27;s your glitch.<p>If your system is synchronous, it means it has a clock, which means the system ignores everything that happens between clock ticks. If your ticks are sufficiently large (as it should be), the glitches will happen before the next tick. So your system will &quot;stabilize&quot; into the right output before the next tick, and everything is fine. But if your system doesn&#x27;t use a clock, these glitches will be propagated to other parts, causing trouble all over the place.",1448510937

As you&#x27;re obviously aware, this cat will require extensive and persistent training. Older animals that are surrendered to a shelter are not-infrequently difficult to train or deal with.<p>People who are -for whatever reason- unable to properly train their animal will often surrender their poorly-socialized and poorly-trained creature to a shelter, where it becomes someone else&#x27;s problem. It kinda sounds like you ended up with one of those kitties.<p>Anyway. Do you have a cat tree or similar carpeted furniture that is -explicitly- for the cat to claw, chew, and otherwise demolish? If you don&#x27;t, you <i>definitely</i> should get one or more such items. They&#x27;re kinda pricey, but:<p>1) Cats with claws are <i>going</i> to scratch things. It&#x27;s what they do, it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> to stop, and it <i>pleases</i> them to scratch things.<p>2) Cat trees/furniture are almost always less expensive than nice human furniture. :)<p>For our cats, occasionally spreading catnip on new cat furniture and encouraging them when they scratched <i>it</i> rather than the human furniture was <i>quite</i> enough to make them stop scratching couches and the like. (You might go so far as to scratch the cat furniture with your hands in view of your cat while making whatever noises of approval you make when the cat does something good.)<p>Once a cat gets it into its head that that cat furniture is <i>its</i> furniture, you don&#x27;t need to go to great lengths to convince the cat to scratch on the new furniture when it inevitably becomes time to replace the worn-out stuff.<p>Cat vomit is an unavoidable part of cat ownership. If the cat vomit <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> nearly always contain a hairball, it&#x27;s entirely possible that the cat&#x27;s food doesn&#x27;t agree with its digestive system. As our cats aged, food that was once perfectly acceptable started to disagree with them, and we went through a multi-month search to find foods that agreed with them.<p>Sadly, I have no advice for the out-of-litterbox shitting and pissing. I&#x27;ve never had to box train an <i>old</i> cat. :( If a cat is <i>unhappy</i> or angry, it may choose to fail to use its litterbox. So, the problem <i>could</i> be more than just the wrong type of litter. But -really- I have no freaking clue. :(<p>Best of luck with your cat.

That's how much I love the N900. Of course, now I have even more reason to play with different software on the broken one (I have an external charger for the batteries).<p>All that being said, I've been looking for a replacement phone with decent QWERTY for a long time (I <i>hate</i> that when you select ""QWERTY"" as a feature, some people think that it's okay to include ""on screen keyboard (QWERTY)"" in that category), but the selection is limited. It's a deal breaker for me, though, as I really don't want to give up org-mode in Emacs. I've heard of the Android org-mode app, and emacs for Android; either of those <i>might</i> be okay, but I really am dreading giving up a ""real"" Linux for something like Android, especially when I can get the source to 90+% of the software I run now, but I'm pretty sure that won't be the case on Android.<p>And don't even talk to me about giving up the FM transmitter that only the N900 seems to have. Another piece of hardware I <i>really</i> don't want to have to replace is my 4Runner (which currently lacks bluetooth stereo input).<p>I'm hopeful for the future though; more and more it seems like options to make your own hardware are becoming available, and the fact that there are multiple open source options for mobile is also a very good sign.",1369061943

Rather, they win because they use their tech in a way that provides superior value to their users.<p>This is something all aspiring entrepreneurs should keep in mind. Nobody cares if your company uses incredibly elegant code or highly sophisticated Machine Learning/NLP/Functional Programming/whatever. All users care about is whether your product provides value. And remember that ""value"" is highly subjective-<i>you</i> may not think that Facebook is useful, but many people will disagree with you.<p>[0]: there are certainly exceptions. If you know that the problem you're solving has major market demand, then you can win with superior execution.

If I can use jQuery and know that I'm not going to have cross-browser DOM API issues, then let me have it. Because the method simply doesn't work in older browsers (<IE8 <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=queryselectorall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/#search=queryselectorall</a>) It's not entirely fair to say that `$("".my-class li:first-child"")` is equal to `document.querySelectorAll("".my-class li:first-child"")` or that `$('.my-class')` is equivalent to `document.getElementsByClassName('my-class')` (doesn't work in <IE9 <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=getelementsbyclassname"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/#search=getelementsbyclassname</a>).<p>If you're building games or working with a team who does, I'm going to guess you're working with fairly edge functionality in browsers where javascript support is great. If you're building sites for clients who are still (sigh) using IE7 internally, you just can't get away with something <i>quite</i> so simple.<p>As another commenter mentioned:\n""Even the most avid follower of JS updates can't compete with a team of the standard jQuery draws upon. When a new method gets rolled in to the core of jQuery, something that speeds up selectors for example, your code improves without you doing any work.""<p>This is the same reason I use a library for preprocessing my CSS. I'd rather update a gem and trust a team whose focus is processing CSS than try to rely on myself for keeping up to date with the pace of the CSS WG and browser vendors.<p>Also, for anyone wanting to dig around the jQuery source, James Padolsey made a great tool for it.

Most of the systems these chips are attached to are tiny embedded processors with very little RAM and no memory protection. It&#x27;s almost a given that a non-negligible number of these systems will crash on this kind of input.

The little LCD display shows some calculations to help the engineer make good braking decisions.<p>Above the dynamic control on the left you see a small rotary lever - if I&#x27;m not mistaken this is the reverser, which simply selects between forward, neutral, and reverse. As a fun fact, this lever pops out and is used as the &quot;key&quot; for the train. For safety reasons, the engineer removes it when they leave the cab so that it&#x27;s difficult to get it out of neutral.<p>The big red button left of the dynamic control is the alerter acknowledge. This is the dead-man protection on locomotives and I suspect may factor into the conclusion on this investigation. When an alarm sounds, the operator has to press that button. The alarm becomes very jarring so it might have brought a confused or unconscious operator back to attention.",1454370845

It reminds me a lot of the QBasic game Outer Space Wars that I wrote when I was 14, having taught myself QBasic from reading a book checked out from the local library. I too made a font editor using some crazy string manipulation to make up for not yet understanding the modulus operator at the time. I so need to try to find those disks and take a look back at some of the first code I ever wrote as a fledgling self-taught teenage programmer.<p>OP, thank you for bringing back the memories.<p>To younger programmers, Internet access was not quite a thing that I had access to then.  Before my dad got AOL, I was only allowed to log into the county library BBS and not any public system. One actually used a modem to dial directly in at that time and no one else could use it simultaneously. Once my family had AOL, I later was able to participate in a programmer chat room on AOL, which was the entry into a whole new world.",1454370456
11016626,comment,11012044,11012044,0,0,greattypo,,,"Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsite<p>Right now the market for educational software is a mess.  It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (19M kids), and 49,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 90 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Right now we&#x27;re also particularly looking for a lead partner engineer: someone who&#x27;s excited to help developers on our platform build products that schools and teachers truly love.<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs</a>, or check out our recent press here:\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-third-of-schools-are-using-this-app-youve-never-heard-of"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-thir...</a>",1454370438

There is simply limited traction and power available and the weight of the full consist is really enormous. This requires planning everything well ahead, which can be difficult in busy areas where you must both anticipate signals and mind an often large number of temporary orders. Train operations tend to sort of happen in slow motion, it&#x27;s not about fast responses simply because by the time you try to make a fast response the situation is already unrecoverable.<p>2) Depending on the exact systems in use, speeding up and especially slowing down a train is more complicated than doing so in a vehicle. You have multiple brake systems available (primarily the dynamic and train air brakes), and the most powerful brake system, the air brakes, comes with a lot of tricky caveats as to how strongly you can apply it (mostly related to applying and releasing it too frequently, which can drain the air reserves). There&#x27;s a lot of great info on this from a former engineer here: <a href=""http://www.alkrug.vcn.com/rrfacts/brakes.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alkrug.vcn.com/rrfacts/brakes.htm</a><p>Certainly the author has decided to dramatize the situation.

[First] thing is to teach [parents] they are the crux of their child&#x27;s success. \n[...]\n> Unfortunately, this article is more interested in exposing income disparity, which is good, but its dressing it under [scholastic] achievement<p>This is an incredibly patronizing statement, followed by an equally delusional one. Let&#x27;s unpack them.<p>The first one hinges on the assumption that poor parents don&#x27;t understand that &quot;they are the crux of their child&#x27;s success&quot;. With the notable exception of the rare completely unfit parent, every parent already knows this. Parents have known this since the beginning of time.<p>This is then followed with a dismissal of the how wealth inequality effects education and thus lifetime gains. &quot;If only the poors went to college!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a very common sentiment, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s right. It stems from the mistaken belief that everyone gets what they deserve because society is a pure meritocracy. It&#x27;s the same sentiment where a multibillion dollar company built on the backs of minimum wage labor tells their employees that if they don&#x27;t buy gum, they&#x27;re money problems will be over.[1] Whereas in the real world, &quot;being poor is knowing exactly how much everything costs&quot;[2].<p>The reason why poor parents aren&#x27;t sending their kid to preschool, is because they don&#x27;t have an extra $15,000 laying around in their bank account. The reason why poor kids underperform in school can all be tracked back to wealth. The distraction of hunger[3], lead paint in homes, and even under resourced schools because... the schools are funded by local property taxes , thus ensuring that the poor remain disadvantaged to the rich. (And if you seriously believe it&#x27;s all just effort, put your kid the poorest public school in your area.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/mcdonalds-sample-budget-sheet-is-laughable-but-its-implications-are-not-cm261920"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasdaq.com/article/mcdonalds-sample-budget-sheet-...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://whatever.scalzi.com/2005/09/03/being-poor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatever.scalzi.com/2005/09/03/being-poor/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/david_sarasohn/index.ssf/2011/09/a_growling_stomach_tends_to_di.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/david_sarasohn/inde...</a>",1454369509

11016495,comment,11008340,11013533,0,0,jcrawfordor,,,"One of the big problems with rolling out infrastructural upgrades to the US train network is, in general, its size. Consider that there are still substantial sections of freight rail in the country that are what is referred to as &quot;dark territory,&quot; meaning that there is no signally installed. Additionally, there is usually no radio or cellular coverage in these areas. Train motion in these areas is typically governed via track warrants, meaning that an engineer must obtain written permission from a dispatcher before entering the area (and only one train is given this permission at a time).<p>In the NE corridor, everything is of course fully signalled, but installing additional wayside equipment such as for PTC is a huge project over many miles of rail, even in relatively small areas. Solar-powered radio equipment has driven down the cost of installation, but not by as much as you might think. A big part of the high cost is the engineering requirements of the federal railway administration, which are (for good reasons) extremely strict and require proven high reliability.<p>This reliability must apply everywhere. GPS availability can be iffy under a number of circumstances, most obviously tunnels. There needs to be some non-GPS method of positioning trains in most systems. An example which the HN community will be relatively familiar with is the BART, which features automated train control. BART trains position themselves (and receive speedcodes for central control) via a continuous antenna strip mounted to the safety cover of the third rail. If you inspect the third rail across from a platform you will see it, as well as occasional cables connecting to the trackside control equipment. Installing this sort of thing over miles gets very costly!<p>The closest analogy to what you are describing is a product called GE Trip Optimizer that uses information about the route and train consist to automatically control throttle for fuel saving purposes. Trip Optimizer does not meet requirements for a safety system, though, and so the engineer is always permitted to override it (and must if any unusual circumstances are encountered), and the engineer must manually account for signals. To be a full PTC system it would still need quite a bit more, most notably reliable communication with signals (better than current cab signal systems).<p>There are sub-PTC safety systems available, such as train stop devices (which can be rigged for overspeed protection). These are still expensive to install though and at this point most everyone wants to go directly to PTC, which provides much greater protection.",1454369052

If they started experimenting left and right like Google does, they would lose that brand image, which is arguably their most valuable asset (even above and beyond the technology itself). If Google releases Glass and it flops, it hardly affects their image (&#x27;well, yes, it&#x27;s cool technology, that&#x27;s what Google does, but I don&#x27;t think people want it for now...&#x27;), if Apple does the same it would be thousands of articles about how Apple is losing its touch and can&#x27;t possible survive without Steve Job&#x27;s genius.<p>Maybe the only way around that is taking a page out of Alphabet&#x27;s playbook and making a parent company with &quot;riskier&quot; subsidiaries with their own non-Apple brand?",1454367618

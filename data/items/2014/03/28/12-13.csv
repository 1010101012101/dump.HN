You are not limited to Ubuntu Unity, and unlike any other OS you do have options.<p>2) I haven&#x27;t had that much experience with Windows 8, but for many systems the UEFI implementation by the vendor is so bad that it will only boot singular binaries in the Windows EFI locations. That means you can never have multiple OSes on that EFI, and there ain&#x27;t jack any Linux distro can do to change that. Additionally, Windows will wipe all other EFI applications when you install it and it regenerates an EFI partition, as it always has in every version ever, it will never play nice with any other OS.<p>3) This relates to 2, but if hardware vendors won&#x27;t produce Linux drivers <i>nobody</i> can force them.<p>But the important lesson is to <i>not</i> buy a Windows computer and bitch when it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a good Linux computer. They are not equivalent, the same hardware is not supported on both OSes (try putting Windows on a RaspPi) and unless you <i>want</i> to have to deal with faulty firmwares and have to stringently analyze every part you buy to make sure its supported hardware (principally because hardware distributors are garbage at mentioning Linux compatibility anywhere) then you should <i>just</i> buy a Linux computer from thinkpenguin, system76, or any of the other actual Linux hardware vendors that will provide you a system that given whatever version of Ubuntu&#x27;s kernel it is running, and beyond, you know the hardware will work out of the box on any distro. <i>That</i> is how to use Linux.",1396011384

That being said, one thing I often tell people is that if they&#x27;re honestly, <i>seriously concerned</i> that they&#x27;re drinking too much and if they&#x27;re asking me whether they&#x27;re an alcoholic, it&#x27;s something worth looking in to.<p>Before I abused alcohol, I abused prescription stimulants.  Sometimes I&#x27;d take them and then spend hours browsing wikipedia reading about their addictive potential, or reading about how abuse of stimulants was spreading across America.  It was a pretty obvious warning sign.<p>The reason I know I&#x27;m an addict is because once I start drinking/popping pills, I really can&#x27;t stop myself.  I keep drinking until I pass out, or keep binging on pills until I&#x27;m out and I haven&#x27;t slept in days.

This happened after the vehicle impacted a roundabout at 110 mph, shearing off 15 feet of concrete curbwall and tearing off the left front wheel, then smashing through an eight foot tall buttressed concrete wall on the other side of the road and tearing off the right front wheel, before crashing into a tree. The driver stepped out and walked away with no permanent injuries and a fire, again limited to the front section of the vehicle, started several minutes later.

Try thinking about what you do every day when you come home from work, and identify your &#x27;triggers&#x27;. If it&#x27;s like mine and you are watching TV while eating dinner, listen to/watch a podcast or TED talk instead. If you end up spending a ton of time on YouTube or Facebook, set up something like SelfControl (or the PC equivalent Cold Turkey) to make sure that you can&#x27;t use those things during times that you have blocked off for work.<p>For mac users, here&#x27;s a list of stuff that you can use (note that I&#x27;m not vouching for any app in particular, but they all seem useful to someone): <a href=""http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/productivity-roundups/15-mac-apps-to-help-you-focus-and-work-productively/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/productivity-roundups/15-ma...</a>",1396008357

So, if an employee is an asset you should treat him as such, and let him go.<p>And if you or your friend CEO get emotionally attached to an employee, you have larger issues.

Neurobiological actually means related to the nervous system of the body.  ALS is also neurobiological, and I&#x27;m guessing you wouldn&#x27;t say it &quot;sounds&quot; psychological.<p>2)If you&#x27;d bothered to look, you&#x27;d find there is actually quite a bit of study of D2 and D4 availability correlated with ADHD symptoms.  Like virtually all medical diagnoses both psychological and physiological, differential diagnosis is done by combining probabilities with presented symptoms, and not with exhaustive testing.  Your requirement of diagnosing ADHD with a brain MRI is the equivalent of requiring endoscopy to diagnose an ulcer.<p>So what you say is factually incorrect, there&#x27;s plenty of evidence.  That&#x27;s why the scientific body of many countries including the US has classified it as neurobiological (not psychological) for years, and the bulk of the scientific community believes pharmaceutical treatment is necessary in the same way that a broken arm needs to actually be set instead of telling the patient not to be lazy.<p>If you want to use scare quotes and insist on unfalsifiable assertions &quot;prove the negative &#x27;not&#x27; the result of psychological conditioning&quot; then you are placing your argument in the same category as climate change deniers and anti-vaccers - anti-science, anti-rigor, pro-scare quotes.",1396008295

Hack on files 'foo' and 'bar', but instead of saying `p4 change`, say `p4 shelve`. Write down the changelist number for later; this changelist is stored on the server now.
2. `p4 revert foo bar`. You don't lose any changes; they're all on the server.
3. Hack on files 'bar' and 'baz'. Submit or shelve those changes.
4. `p4 unshelve -c (changelist number from step 1)`. (You'll probably need to resolve here.) Your original changes are back!<p>Git certainly breaks down if you're working on one massive branch, but it's designed for lots of branching. Go ahead; we're encouraging you to branch for every new feature, every bug fix, <i>everything</i>. Here's the above workflow in git:<p>1. `git checkout -b first-change`. Hack on files 'foo' and 'bar' and commit.
2. `git checkout old-branch`, where 'old-branch' is the branch that you were on before step 1, probably 'master'. Now `git checkout -b second-change` and edit files 'bar' and 'baz'. Commit again.
3. Checkout the old branch (master, likely) again. `git merge first-change`. `git merge second-change`. Resolve if required. Test. Push changes to the remote server.<p>Best of all, you don't need to branch <i>before</i> making your changes. You could actually move the `git checkout -b first-change` to after the edits on that branch, and it would still do what you want.",1274158140

Think of it as if you're formally presenting your case to a judge, but that judge is pre-disposed to rule against you.  Be thorough.<p>Legally, assuming you have documentation to back-up their $750 budget, their request for your physical presence, and your $700 of expenses, it looks like a clear case of ""breach of contract"".<p>The only flimsy legal leg the company might have to stand on is if the particular HR representative didn't have ""agency"" to represent the company in your travel reimbursement negotiations (highly unlikely since it seems as if you've already spoken directly with someone who's post-facto implied such an agency by haggling).<p>I live in Northern Virginia just south of Herndon.  FWIW, IANAL, but as a business owner, home owner, and investor, I have more than a passing personal expertise in VA commercial contract law at both the small-claims and general district court level.<p>If, after the formal demand letter, they don't pay-up and you still wish to pursue formal channels, the amount falls under small-claims statutes.  Technically, you'll be filing for a ""warrant in debt"" [PDF] <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2fk54ce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/2fk54ce</a> rather than ""breach of contract"".  This is both good and bad.  It's good since the current general case docket in VA right now is about 10 months.<p>It's bad in that, as a person, you MUST represent yourself in small claims court in VA.  Only a company has the ""luxury"" of formal in-court legal counsel under small claims in VA.  At the minimum, you're going to incur a risk that your additional filing and travel expenses to/from the hearing itself may not be included in the final judgment (most of the time they aren't).  Nevertheless, you'll want to include them for possible liens, etc.  Much like taxes, don't be afraid to itemize.

So academic institutions, be they schools, colleges, or universities select one of 3 possible packages – Small, Medium or Large based on  the number of servers they need monitored, and nothing else.  It’s that simple.<p>Starting from just $248 per month, the Academic Plan, is a perfect offer for schools with even the tightest of budgets, as all added-value services are free – the number of parameters to monitor, the number of network devices, and even alerts including Live Voice and SMS alerts.  As a result, educational institutions have the luxury of employing a single monitoring solution instead of the standard current mix of multiple open-source software solutions (e.g. Nagios, Zabbix, Zenos, Cacti), commercial software solutions (like Solarwinds, Whatsup Gold), and external end-user experience monitoring services (like Gomez, Keynote).<p>Given that Monitis operates on a SaaS model and is based in the Cloud, IT managers throughout Academia can avoid the cost, stress, hassles, and limitations of using traditional software-based monitoring tools.  With Monitis there are no upfront license fees, no updates to manage, and no servers to maintain.  Getting set-up and running with the complete suite takes only 5 minutes, and as Monitis offers the Industry’s most reliable notification system, users can rest easy knowing that they’ll be notified even if their system or network is completely down.<p>But in addition to all of the professional advantages Monitis offers, it is also the greenest monitoring solution available today.  Because schools, colleges, and universities that use Monitis don’t have to buy and operate their own monitoring servers, they save massively on electricity bills and minimize their carbon footprint.  Indeed, with the average server’s electricity bills running approximately US $1,050/year, academic institutions save more money on electricity bills than they will spend on Monitis’ services.  The savings increase even more dramatically when the cost of acquiring and maintaining the server are included, as well.<p>Said Monitis’ Founder and CEO, Hovhannes Avoyan, “For schools, colleges, and universities around the world, Monitis’ Academic Pricing plan is a no-brainer.  Take the world’s leading-edge monitoring technology, wrap it in a pricing plan with a TCO that’s even lower than open-source systems like Nagios or Cacti, and then factor in the carbon footprint reductions, and Monitis has an offer for Academia that is truly unbeatable.” See more at http://portal.monitis.com/index.php/monitis-for-education",1274155442

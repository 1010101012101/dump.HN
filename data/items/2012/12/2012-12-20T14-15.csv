4947995,comment,4945476,4946195,1,0,martinced,,,"You are right when you say the economics is deeply corrupted by politics.  At least mainstrean economics.<p>The problem is one of propaganda first and foremost: the <i>only</i> thing that is widely thaught in universities and that we keep hearing all the times is Keynes.<p>The problem is: Keynesianism is totally unable to predict anything further than two or three years.  It also inevitably leads to the country defaulting.  There's no other way.  There never has been any other way for a country run under the Keynesian dogma.<p>I'll give an example: before the first euro even circulated there have been economists (of course non-Keynesian ones) who predicted the very exact scenario that happened to the eurozone 13 years later.  Too many houses in Spain, too many industries in Germany, too many public servants in France and as well the default of Greece and Spain (Greece is going to default again btw and Spain is going to eventually default too).<p>These were quite impressive ""predictions"" for some.  For others it was simply about applying what Friedman has been telling since forever.<p>That's the problem: Keynesianism can only predict up to two or three years in advance and that at the cost of sinking the country.<p>But Keynesianism is precisely what politicians wants to hear: they take it as a free ticket allowing them to create an always bigger public sector (and hence they can feel always more and more ""important"").<p>The result?  Deeply corrupted economists that happily sing the only song that politicians want to hear.<p>The non-Keynesian economists who precisely predicted the mess we're in today?  Nobody is listening to them (well I am for my positions, because it nets me a <i>lot</i> of money but not a single politican want to listen to them).<p>This is really a sad state of affair and it shall stay like that as long as the fraud that Keynesianism is is going to be taught in universities as if it was the holy gospel.<p>Note that the disciples of Friedman who predicted Spain and Greece's defaults did not just say: ""Spain and Greece are eventually going to default"".  They did predict precisely the mechanism, over a decade and a half, that would lead to the defaults.  They were already right for Greece and the future is going to prove them correct again.<p>Note that since then they've explained why there's no way on earth Greece is ever going to repay its debt and that inevitably Greece would default again.<p>While the Keynesians are all wrong and keep telling us that more public debt is going to solve all the eurozone issues.<p>The problem is that once countries reach about 100% of public debt (which they inevitably do when run under the Keynesian dogma), there's simply no way out using Keynesian tactics.<p>So, yup, to me Keynesianism is an utter failure and it's going to get uglier and uglier.<p>You don't want to be jobless in Greece today.<p>The fact is: Friedman disciples predicted precisely that in 1999.  Keynesians didn't.",1356015581

It's the closest term I know of to name the process I describe, so that's what I used.  As you can see from the post, I'm aware of the semantic and etymological difficulty.  If you have a better term you'd like to suggest, I'm all ears; having it won't make the process I describe ""more wrong"" though.<p>To use your characterization, the database index example is where someone has an expectation that adding indexes are a valid reflexive response to slow querying.<p>Of course the post goes back to navel-gazing in the end.

4947988,comment,4947511,4947511,4,0,lprubin,,,"For those interested in the original origin of the phrase ""cargo cult,"" during WWII a bunch of American soldiers landed in a small island chain in the Pacific called Melanesia.  They showed up out of nowhere with huge ships and planes, brought a bunch of food, vehicles and contraptions, looked and spoke completely differently than the inhabitants had hardly seen in such numbers.  The GIs shared their food, gave little gifts to the natives, and then abruptly left.<p>The locals then built altars (such as the straw plane in the OP) in the hopes of luring back the ""visiters from another place"" and ushering in another era of abundance.

Being a cynical lawyer, while this may be good enough for some people, I'm still cynical.  I've seen plenty of non-profits, even in the open source world, go bad.  Hell I've helped fund/start non-profits with completely altruistic purposes, like Mozilla does (IE ""Helping to open government data and standardize it"", or ""Provide a completely free non-advertising/non-tracking search engine for non-profit volunteer opportunities""), and seen them go bad and do evil things, despite the best intentions of all the engineers working for them.  So while I agree Mozilla is in a better position than most, the idea that simply being owned/responsible to a non-profit makes it ""better"" is, well, wrong, in my opinion.  They go bad just as easily.<p>2. I used to be involved in some auxillary mozilla projects (bugzilla, etc).

What is also true is that, without production there is no consumption. Digging up holes and filling them in is not production, ergo, consumption will not rise.</i><p>And yet Keynesian stimulus worked in Australia[1]. Australia was able to implement it properly because the Australian economy had run years of surplus budgets prior to the financial crisis.<p>The jibe about digging holes is disappointing and ignorant. The Australian program involved a one off payment to tax payers for immediate effect (which ended up supporting the retail sector at Christmas time), traditional infrastructure spending on ""ready to go"" projects (roads etc) for effect in a couple of months and a very large school building program where building usually started 6-9 months after the initial crisis.

The level of depth varies but a license that considered all possibilities - and so wasn't 'malformed' would be very difficult to work with.<p>So a company needs a certain level of freedom so they can disclaim copyright infringement in circumstances such as showing adverts alongside your work. But that level of freedom means they could by the letter of the agreed terms use your images for advertising, but the company have told you that's not the purpose of the clause and that they don't intend to do that.<p>So you're fine as long as the company continues to act ethically. There's possibly an implied license, worth the paper it's written on, etc., etc.. Should they really go in to specifying what ""alongside"" means and the relative proportion of advertising text on a page and whether advertising overlaps; whether an interstitial (lightbox) based ad would be allowed if it showed some of your image through the semi-opaque background; whether adverts for the site that say had a glimpse of one of your images in the background were allowed; suppose there's a trade show and you happen to be friends with a speaker and your image shows in their timeline ... is that within the letter of the terms. And so-on and so-forth.<p>This is why trust is important to save wrapping up our entire lives in legalese.<p>If a company respects it's clients as people, then even if there is a loophole in the ToS whereby they can screw those people up they won't.",1356014948

I was using it as a euphemism for ""mediocre"", which it is for a person who lives in a high-COL city (one of the main reasons rents are so high is that career progress is faster out here) and in lucrative industries. When people not 1/10 as talented or capable as I am are, at the same age, making MD in investment banks, being acquired for millions, or making 500+ in private equity, I think it's fair to say that a 12-14% trajectory is pretty damn uninspiring. Money isn't an issue, but I'd be calling way more shots at my age if I hadn't taken so many bad risks (read: shitty startups).<p>I'm 0 for 2 in picking startups. The first just didn't have legs (our CEO had no idea what people actually wanted and would pay for) but my mistake was to spend almost 3 years trying to make it work. The second had unethical management who (a) tried to use my engineering credibility to justify dodgy personnel moves, attempting to force me to sign affidavits claiming my colleagues were incompetent (they weren't, but they had ""too much"" equity) and (b) after I resigned, did all sorts of disgusting stuff to try to fuck with my career.<p>You're right that if you don't change employer or get a promotion, you're unlikely to get a substantial raise.

4947714,comment,4946445,4947301,2,0,law,,,"> He's not saying they must conform with these ambiguous rules. But if they don't, it's fair to be contemptuous of them. There is nothing at all unusual about this, there are lots of actions that won't get you in jail but will get you punished in various social manners.<p>I disagree, though. They're following the law as written, which the vast majority of people and organizations do daily. The distinction is that by doing so, they've found a ""bug"" in the system, and that's something that deserves admiration rather than contempt. Here's the analogy: someone spots a bug in a program, and they're exploiting that bug in a way that's harming other users. Who deserves those users contempt more: (1) the hacker who found & exploits the bug; or (2) or the quiescent software developer who fails to timely patch that bug? I think it's (2), which is why I'm reluctant to socially punish NPEs. They're publicizing flaws in patent legislation to the detriment to many innocents. Consider this akin to ""crowdsourcing"" Congress, subject to a cost function (namely, the magnitude of harm suffered by the innocents). It's Congress' continued inaction that deserves the magnitude of our contempt; socially vilifying the 'hacker' is just a band-aid solution.",1356012189

His earnestness and clarity is very evident, and you can tell he was once just a very curious kid with a sharp ability to focus. I'm grateful to have read it.<p>At the same time, I can't help but feel like he's talking directly to me. This is the kind of person who impacts you just through the sheer fact that he -lived-. As for the people harping about the notion of stress that he mentions at the end, I think it's meant differently. I think he means he's happy to have achieved what he has.<p>I also just watched his talk ""How we stopped SOPA"", and his speaking style echoed this article.<p>There is a quote that I've always tried to live by, which I think sums up Aaron's spirit.<p><i>""The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.""</i>",1357995368

The first is visible and appears over a long period of time-- felony convictions, mental instability, or extreme career adversity-- but it never seems that things are <i>that</i> bad (especially because a lot of people refuse to admit that good things can happen to bad people). The second is fairly sudden and seems ""random"". This is why suicides are so unexpected. A person can seem to be ""not that bad off"" one day, and the next day, commit suicide.<p>The scary thing is that the first kind of conditions are being more common. We have:<p>* draconian sentences for minor crimes, including drug possession, white-hat hacking, and file sharing,\n* an increasing willingness of corporations to use extreme and illegal career adversity (e.g. blacklisting) against whistleblowers, \n* increasing difficulty for a person to ""re-invent"" him- or herself in the wake of a bad reputation.<p>Thirty years ago, if your life got fucked up, you could pull a Don Draper. You could pay people off to represent themselves as past employers and reconstruct your career under an alternate name, and move halfway across the country.

5047607,comment,5047421,5047421,14,0,philh,,,"> The Joker scares the city onto its two ferries. Once the ferries are in the middle of the water, he cuts their power and gives them both a button to blow up the other ferry, thereby constructing a prisoners dilemma (one boat is filled with real prisoners). The passengers discuss and vote. One of the prisoners makes a Ulysses pact and credibly commits by tossing the detonator overboard.<p>This isn't actually a prisoner's dilemma. In a PD, both players decide simultaneously, and your payoff depends on both choices. In this, your payoff simply depends on who defects first, with the caveat (which turns out to be false) that if nobody defects you both die.<p>(If you assume both boats decide simultaneously whether to defect or not, it still isn't a PD. The payoff matrix looks like 1,1 / 1,0 / 0,1 / 0,0 if nobody dies when they both cooperate: it's not a PD because defecting doesn't increase your score. If everyone dies when you both cooperate, the payoff matrix is 0,0 / 1,0 / 0,1 / 0,0: utility is not maximised by both players cooperating.)<p>Nor is tossing the detonator a credible commitment, in game theory terms, unless the other boat sees it.",1357993673

It's about culture. People in northern latitudes like their 9:00pm daylight in the summer, but no one wants 8:00am darkness in the winter, so we switch back to ""standard"" time (which is now the anomaly, covering only 4.5 months) in the colder months.<p>This also explains the lopsided calendar of DST. It corresponds with the warmth and outdoor activity, not daylight. That's why we start it near the spring equinox and continue it into early November (a month and a half from the solstice). That would make no sense if it were about daylight: it's not symmetrical. It's also about weather. Daylight wise, October and February are roughly equivalent. However, October is warm and has pretty leaves, and February is cold and snowy. When it's warm, we adjust the clock to have an additional hour of light in the evening. When it's cold, we adjust it back to have daylight in the morning (most of us will be leaving work in the darkness regardless of DST, so let's at least treat ourselves to a couple hours of light in the morning).<p>So long as my life is semi-constrained by others' marking of time, I'll be in favor of DST.

Before hacking, before startups, before entrepreneurs, before changing the world felt like a cool, common thing.<p>Before all of that, I remember this guy doing it, doing it well. And that inspired me to believe I can do it.<p>An artist's only passion is to create, until the day you die. In between you fight all sorts of battles that they don't warn you about. But the most important being that when you create, you carry with you a savagery of sorts, of making something new, of living in the edge.<p>And it's hard to survive. Nowadays we take for granted the Google style lunches and buslines, but being at the edge of something has always been trying to eke out in an hostile environment.<p>But this guy was there, all day, all night.<p>And that's special. Because it's an isolating experience.<p>I get the same suicidal thoughts that drift in and out too. It's partly chemical and it's just your personality. When you stand outside of the system long enough, watch long enough, suffer the heartbreak of seeing the wrongs enough, you may end up there too.<p>This was the glorious ending I wished for him.<p>May he truly rest now in peace.",1357993456

Given the overbearing nature of our legal system, it would be impractical to do otherwise. This was just pointlessly maximalist DOJ behavior. On the other hand, shame on us for allowing these laws to exist at all, and creating opportunities for selective enforcement and massively unreasonable sentences.<p>I'd also like to add here that while maybe the DOJ had no way to know that Aaron would kill himself, their general pattern of ruining people's lives over minor offenses will, it seems obvious to me, result in some number of suicides. Heat up a pot of water and some percentage of the molecules evaporate. So while we can't hold the DOJ responsible for Aaron's actions, we can certainly hold them accountable for the aggregate misery they've created for so many people. And we should.",1357993288

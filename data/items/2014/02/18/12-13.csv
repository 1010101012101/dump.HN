7257858,comment,7253710,7254015,4,0,userbinator,,,"> I wish extreme performance goals and requirements would become a new trend.<p>Not just performance, but efficiency - both speed <i>and</i> size. Sadly it seems that most of the time this point is brought up, it gets dismissed as &quot;premature optimisation&quot;. Instead we&#x27;re taught in CS to pile abstraction upon abstraction even when they&#x27;re not really needed, to create overly complex systems just to perform simple tasks, to not care much about efficiency &quot;because hardware is always getting better&quot;. I&#x27;ve never agreed with that sort of thinking.<p>I think it creates a skewed perception of what can be accomplished with current hardware, since it makes optimisation an &quot;only if it&#x27;s not fast/small enough/we can&#x27;t afford new hardware&quot; goal; it won&#x27;t be part of the mindset when designing, nor when writing the bulk of the code. The demoscene challenges this type of thought; it shows that if you design with specific size/speed goals in mind, you can achieve what others would have thought to be impossible. I think that&#x27;s a real eye-opener; by pushing the limits, it&#x27;s basically saying just how extremely inefficient most software is.",1392728370

For example, we recently awarded a $10,000 research grant to Dr. Joao Pedro de Magelhaes at the University of Liverpool to sequence the genome of the bowhead whale in order to study mechanisms for longevity in this warm-blooded mammal whose lifespan is estimated at over 200 years.<p>Not only are bowhead whales far longer-lived than humans, but their massive size means that they are likely to possess unique tumor suppression mechanisms. “These mechanisms for the longevity and resistance to aging-related diseases of bowhead whales are unknown,” says Dr. de Magelhaes, “but it is clear that in order to live so long, these animals must possess aging prevention mechanisms related to cancer, immunosenescence, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.&quot;<p>The bowhead whale study will be conducted at the state-of-the-art Liverpool Centre for Genomic Research and results will be made available to the research community.",1392728232

I&#x27;m sure you guys will be iterating on improving the algorithms, but just wanted to flag that as a potential turnoff for anyone comparing your website demo with Alchemy.<p>Best of luck!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/demo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/demo/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/world/middleeast/bombings-in-syria-force-wave-of-civilians-to-flee.html?hp&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/world/middleeast/bombings-...</a>",1392727138

Out of curiosity I clicked the link on the original email, containing the activation code, and was taken to the standard Facebook login page. Obviously I cannot attempt to login to that account as I do not have the password, but also, the original registrant cannot confirm the account because the will not have received the registration code.<p>The time period to confirm the account has now expired, but I am still being spammed with Portuguese Facebook messages that I do not want, and there does not appear to be any way to stop them.<p>Is there anything you can do to help with this?

Even then, most normal people (the kind of people who are likely going to run into this problem most often) aren&#x27;t going to understand how to do anything other than use the default features encoded into their wallet software (which are remarkably deterministic in function, almost never obfuscates the change making the middle steps trivially transparent, and generally don&#x27;t provide any control over which transactions will accidentally cluster).

The transaction record of bitcoin is out there for everyone to datamine, and if you make a mistake the record will still be there and still be public years from now. There might even be new techniques (whether bitcoin-specific, or generally in the fields of statistics or machine learning) that will make this data more transparent in the future.

Let me break it down into to separate points which are better described.<p>The problems with the project scaling are primarily down to the infrastructure: MSBuild and the C# compiler are damn slow as is the whole rip up and replace assembly system in .Net. When you have something at the bottom of a dependency chain that is quite deep (with any enterprisey project), you have to recompile all consumers and therefore everything that depends on them and so forth. A single line change means you end up compiling the entire system on top of it. All 200Mb of DLLs need building again. That&#x27;s a long time. Not only that, when it comes to testing and runtime dev (i.e. using the web front end), reloading assemblies and performing JIT is really expensive and time consuming.<p>Every time you do something, mount everest is destroyed and recompiled twice: one to IL and once to native. This is expensive and seriously screws productivity. It doesn&#x27;t scale development-wise. Simple as.  This is not specific to my current project - I&#x27;ve consulted at various companies since 2002 and that&#x27;s exactly what it has ended up for everyone, every time.<p>Going back to LLVM/XCode. I&#x27;m not particularly experienced with the specifics of the abstraction that Apple provide, but I&#x27;ve spent 20 years building monstrous bits of C on top of Unix/Linux with GCC and Sun compiler suite. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re still dealing with but we have LLVM which slings code out much faster than anything we&#x27;ve had before. We also have incremental build support (individual .o files per source file), faster linking and a runtime system that doesn&#x27;t require recompilation.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;ll realistically turn into anything better at the end of the day but one some points:<p>1. The Xcode tooling is like lightning, even with a 200,000 line C project I imported from a previous project.<p>2. The startup time is 487ms compared to the same thing in C# of 2.2s to first output and 10.5s to it actually doing something.<p>Think I&#x27;ve explained myself better now. Sorry for the initial confusion.",1392726171

We are still (and this is especially evident on HN) thinking in mid 20th century paradigms, remnants of half dead ideologies and long dead political maneuvering. Just because these ideas have evolved over time does not mean they are not half baked. That doesn&#x27;t stop people from treating them like a matter of personal identity.<p>The &quot;Left&quot; believes extreme wealth will inevitably corrupt the political process. It&#x27;s naive to think that billionaires will not use their money to buy power and more wealth. The &quot;Right&quot; thinks that the state will inevitably corrupt business and/or be corrupted by wealth.  It&#x27;s naive to think that bureaucrats with a rubber stamps that adds a zero to the value of land or a semi legitimate patent into an 8 figure asset asset will not be corrupted by wealth. They call it regulatory capture.<p>IMO both these views, if we call them views are impoverished. They rely on economic and political narratives that have &quot;capital&quot; & &quot;labour&quot; as their basis.

He was a strong proponent of pilot-wave theory though towards the end he also started to like GRW which itself consists of two distinct ontological possibilities.<p>In as much as QM makes predictions, pilot wave theory makes the same predictions. But pilot wave theory has the advantage of being an honest theory that actually does make predictions. QM suffers from needing an external agent to collapse the system, an agent that is never specified, particularly on the universal level. Bell puts it very eloquently about whether one needed to wait for the first form of life to do it or perhaps one with a PhD to collapse the universe. He concludes it must be happening more or less all the time and that the mechanism needs to be explained in the theory. We can either change Schrodinger&#x27;s equation as in GRW or we can add additional variables such as positions of particles as in pilot wave theory. Or we need to accept that most of reality is unlike our actual experience of a single reality such as in many worlds.",1392725088

This is completely backwards from what happens in say Java/Scala with Maven, SBT or Gradle.<p>The advantage of having the build process external, as happens with Maven and Maven-like environments, is that you can easily automate things by writing plugins, plus you&#x27;re not tied to the IDE at all. You need to push your artifacts into a repository? There&#x27;s a plugin for that. You need to sign your artifacts with a PGP key? There&#x27;s a plugin for that. You need to automatically increment the version number on releases? There&#x27;s a plugin for that. Etc, etc... and all of these can be used in continuos integration processes.<p>Plus, MSBuild doesn&#x27;t handle dependency management, which is completely retarded. You&#x27;ve got NuGet now, but again, Microsoft had to over-engineer it, to make it IDE friendly and thus the ease of setting up your own Maven repository is gone.<p>And have you tried building MSBuild projects on top of Mono? Try it. It&#x27;s fun ;-)<p>Basically only a .NET developer that never experienced other environments could claim that MSBuild/VS.NET is satisfactory, but for the rest of us, it&#x27;s like trying to do software development with early-2000 tools and IMHO, that&#x27;s where the entire .NET ecosystem is.",1392724994

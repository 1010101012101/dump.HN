We are developing a pluggable framework for Tor integration on iOS called OnionKit [1] based off of Onion Browser for the ChatSecure project [2], the only open source OTR compatible chat client for that platform. It's in pretty rough shape right now because we got stuck trying to figure out how to make Apple's Networking APIs honor the proxy settings on TCP connections, so please contact us if you can help solve this problem.<p>Since it doesn't involve the transfer of money or copyrighted material, it shouldn't yet be rejected by Apple's reviewers as the BitTorrent and BitCoin protocol have been. Skype is still allowed, and that technically is (or used to be?) a peer to peer communications system.<p>Unfortunately, you aren't presently allowed by Apple to run a background socket on iOS for longer than 10 minutes unless it is a full VoIP application, so you would never be able to use it for push-style communication, without compromising a user's anonymity via a web backend that stores your APNS token (device specific messaging token for iOS devices).<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ChatSecure/OnionKit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ChatSecure/OnionKit</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://chatsecure.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chatsecure.org</a>",1369454195

Since the data adds up to one (so you would have to convert each data set to percentages). Useful when you don't know the exact distribution of the data at hand.<p>To give an easy to visualize example, a teacher that grades on the curve, does so by normalizing the data (taking the top 10% of the grades for a test and making those A's regardless of previous score, then making the top 10%-20% B's regardless of score and so on.

Characters from the Lord of the Rings trilogy made their way into tutorials and references to the Flying Circus were everywhere.  Communities were a lot more accepting of newcomers and few people were so paranoid of <i>bad, unmaintainable, spaghetti code</i>.  There was less of a focus on being a <i>10x developer</i> and more on learning, having fun, and doing neat things.<p>I'm probably remembering things with rose-tinted glasses.<p>These days, even in open source -- the once proud land of eccentric hackers and the <i>can-do</i> spirit, there is such a negative focus on <i>bad developers</i>.

There's always room to improve ourselves and it's important to listen to criticism so that we know where to start. But sometimes you just need to cut loose and let it all hang out.  I started writing a library I call ""Horton,"" for this very purpose: <i>whimsy</i>, <i>pleasure</i>, and most of all to <i>avoid</i> the engineer mindset!<p>In order gain insights and develop new ideas you have to find new hunches and investigate them.

For example, compare the amount of software that went into a phone ten years ago with the gigabytes of software that sits on a smartphone today, or the complexity of the UI on a phone ten years ago vs. today. Not to mention the increased functionality of the servers at the back-ends of all these apps.<p>Also, if you're starting a project from scratch, you can use the latest and most streamlined technology. But if you're supporting a large code base (millions of lines of code) and adding features to it, you can't just suddenly re-write all your code to use the latest techniques. Also, you may be locked into a technology by your customers. For example, in the enterprise software space, lots of customers have a huge investment in Java application servers on which all their software runs, and if you want to compete in that space, it's easier to sell them a Java-based system than it is to convince them to install and learn to support a Ruby-based system just to run your product. And there's probably much more code (and programmers) in enterprise software -- think of all the software that supports banks, insurance companies, hospitals, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, etc. -- than in the start-up world. I don't think AI is going to make a dent in that huge, complex pile of legacy software any time soon.",1369451059

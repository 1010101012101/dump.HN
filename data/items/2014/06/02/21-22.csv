I can&#x27;t say either one excited me.  At first it looked like Office 365 could cover most of these bases.  I have to say, Microsoft needs a lobotomy.<p>My current solution is to run multiple instances of Office on the desktop.  Each one has it&#x27;s own PSD file and they are, for all intents and purposes, fully segregated.  For those of use who have to have visibility into multiple accounts (info@, support@, etc.) it&#x27;s a very simple matter of adding those accounts and having those emails sorted to their own inboxes.  So you can have full visibility into all the email you need for one of the businesses within an isolated application window.  Need to do email for the other business?  Pop over to the other instance of Outlook and you&#x27;ve switched environments.<p>As much as I hate to suggest this, I am now thinking that running a Linode instance as a pure email server might be the ticket.  I could then have people log on to their webmail.  One could have one company per tab and context switch very easily.  Other Linodes would host web and DB, just as planned.<p>I am hoping I am not aware of a really cool unified solution that can deal with this elegantly.

For a start, they analysed hurricane data from 1950, but hurricanes all had female names at first. They only started getting male names on alternate years in 1979. This matters because hurricanes have also, on average, been getting less deadly over time. &#x27;It could be that more people die in female-named hurricanes, simply because more people died in hurricanes on average before they started getting male names,&#x27; says Lazo.<p>Jung’s team tried to address this problem by separately analysing the data for hurricanes before and after 1979. They claim that the findings &#x27;directionally replicated those in the full dataset&#x27; but that’s a bit of a fudge. The fact is they couldn’t find a significant link between the femininity of a hurricane’s name and the damage it caused for either the pre-1979 set or the post-1979 one (and a &#x27;marginally significant interaction&#x27; of p=0.073 doesn’t really count). The team argues that splitting the data meant there weren’t enough hurricanes in each subset to provide enough statistical power.

7836359,comment,7834665,7835620,3,0,digitailor,,,"Yes, I agree. I&#x27;m a professional visual designer, FWIW.<p>After 22 years on Macintosh, I&#x27;ve completely transitioned to Crunchbang on a MacBook Pro and a Windows 7/Crunchbang dual-boot workstation. I really like the translucency and general look of Win7. I had started to feel like OS X was visually dated, but more importantly, harming my workflow.<p>For development and design, I am working nearly twice as fast in the OS using Crunchbang, and I&#x27;ve made it look and behave just the way I want it to. OS X is completely non-configurable! Since the only thing I need a consumer OS for at this point is for digital audio, I moved to Win7 as I wasn&#x27;t about to lay out the $$ for the new, unfathomable, Mac Pro. What is that thing anyway? I worked with a guy in a metal shop to customize a case for my new workstation, tricked it out with an internal pro audio interface with exposed preamps and 1/4&quot; jacks, and made it a 3U rack-mount. That versus a garbage can?<p>That being said, my 2007 Mac Pro is still ticking and I&#x27;ve been able to upgrade it considerably, though changing the processor was a PITA. It&#x27;s still on 10.6.8- what I consider the high-water mark of OS X- but I would need Mavericks now, and that needs a 64-bit bootloader. (Couldn&#x27;t use the hack for this since I have a flashed PC GPU in it and that precludes the hack.) Like I said, I can&#x27;t fathom buying a new Mac Pro.<p>The way I see it, Apple is just for consumer devices now, and I love &#x27;em. My iPad is critical to my workflow. OS X? Considered harmful. And visually dated!",1401742902

I have enough experience in this industry to tell you the IIT guy has only one advantage, the IIT brand. The brand is extremely powerful, and the alumni network is large enough to secure you a life time of jobs no matter how bad you are in your work.<p>I&#x27;ve seen practically a little to no difference between IIT folks and folks from other colleges. They just happen to know how to stuff books in their brains to clear competitive exams and interviews. Besides that, when it comes to the ability to get things done they and every one else are just the same.<p>You will see nothing changes in the industry when you pass out. Chances are there you will see IIT folks get big ticket salaries, though they don&#x27;t do 1/100th the work you do. Or easily shift jobs, because their seniors are well placed there.<p>True meritocracy is a far fetched dream in India.",1381211870

Then the financial crisis hit, and people slammed the brakes on borrowing. Debt per adult in the 10 countries fell 1 percent in the 4 1/2 years after 2007.

I&#x27;m not a traditional developer, and only dabbled with Rails and the like on an anecdotal basis. My past experience with things like jQuery made it easy to pick up Meteor and its basic concepts, so I just started building the app above (it&#x27;s something I really wanted/needed and I didn&#x27;t want to waste a lot of time inner-bickering about what tech to build it with).<p>I guess for your idea I&#x27;d have to see a sketch, but on the surface, yes, I&#x27;d say something like that would be pretty easy. The cool thing about Meteor is that it takes a lot of the thinking/logic out of the loop. So for example, you would have the nodes as a Mongo collection and for each plan/doc, just store their position info. Meteor/Mongo update automatically, so if say you used something like jQuery UI drag/drop, you would just have it update the given object in Mongo when you pick it up or put it down. Make sense?<p>My overall experience has been that I haven&#x27;t gotten frustrated with Meteor like I did with other frameworks. It&#x27;s not as rigid, sure, but if you take the time to develop a good design practice, it can be really efficient. Plus, having both front and backend code in JS is a serious time saver.<p>Thanks for the complements on design.

I&#x27;d say really its strength is just how amazingly simple and easy it is to get something going.<p>It&#x27;s been a year since I played with it, but at least at the time the weak side seemed to be integrating with any existing systems you may have, whether front or back or middle or sideways. In those cases the magic doesn&#x27;t work for you and you&#x27;ve got to figure out how to plumb it. (Again this may have improved in the past year.)",1381208622

Me and cousin of the same age, worked on Macromedia Flash. I am not saying we built the most amazing games back then, but it was a start. Sure I had briefcase full of pokemon cards (which i took to trade meetings) but that doesn&#x27;t mean I didnt have time for game dev. I dont know about OP but for us it was never a &quot;career&quot; thing. It was &quot;play&quot;. We had fun making that stuff. Amongst all the other fun things we used to do, game dev was just another one of em =)",1381208604

The kind of fast reactor that can burn down nuclear waste so we don&#x27;t need to build nuclear waste storage system, which nobody knows how to build anyway. That would give us power supply for several centuries (along with renewable energy). Too many countries wasted too much money on fusion reactors for decades, while we are still running nuclear reactors designed/built more than 30 years ago. Just wrong priority order.",1381208469

I think maybe I can guess but really not sure at all.<p>I don&#x27;t see how static typing is really necessary to prevent you from storing user-specific data in a global and sending someone another user&#x27;s data.  Seems like that would be fairly straightforward to detect and avoid and I don&#x27;t think you would usually be tempted to use a global for something like that.  You could use a session variable or database.<p>If you have never worked on the back end, then you are right to be afraid of doing something wrong.  However, you are incorrect if you think that means you are likely to make a serious error that you can&#x27;t correct and therefore shouldn&#x27;t try.  Back end programming is in fact less complex than front-end programming today.  So you should jump in.  You will learn the most important things you need within a few months.<p>When you upload a file this generally happens as an HTTP POST.  Usually this is sent to your own back-end server code.  And without special headers on the target domain your browser won&#x27;t even allow you to POST to another third-party server.  This I think is the issue you are talking about when you mention accessing independent REST services -- that needs to use JSONP or have CORS enabled on the third party server.<p>Of course you may not need to learn anything about back-end programming because you can in fact build just about any kind of application these days without using your own server at all, just by integrating a number of third-party APIs and running everything from the browser.",1381208430

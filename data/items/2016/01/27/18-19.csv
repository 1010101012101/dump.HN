Just today I was talking with someone who was really frustrated that they can&#x27;t see webpages anymore because web browsers all got rid of the magnification feature.  He was amazed to discover that it has been there all along but hidden away in a menu that doesn&#x27;t even appear unless you hit alt.  He thought all of that was moved over to the &quot;hamburger&quot; menu, and they just dropped it.

It is also true that there is an escape valve in new needs, requiring new jobs, that allows for us to shift occupations and remain employed.<p>However, there is no law that states that the escape valve will always work, nor that it can work at high rates of job displacement.<p>Moreover, there are signs of low aggregate demand in developed economies. These signs are appearing now even in developing economies. This means that money is not percolating down into the hands of people, who can&#x27;t then spend and create demand. There is a huge number of factors at play here (see the note about being a complex problem). Higher worker efficiency causing higher unemployment rates is one such factor.

For one, to teach a person something new, you typically don&#x27;t need to tell them about it thousands of times. So the state of the art in AI is still much slower than how we learn.<p>Unsupervised learning is not necessarily the answer. The computer would have to be given plenty of spare time to learn random patterns from the universe and have enough inteligence to apply these to a problem. What would be better is if we could tell the AI <i>once</i> and have it figure things out. When you start a new job that&#x27;s what happens, someone tells you the instructions. (They may or may not show you as well, and may or may not stick around to correct your mistakes.) This requires interpreting the instructions into rules and then attempting to apply them, learning from mistakes, and then evolving that into rules that work, then after enough examples of success, evolving into patterns recognition that makes it more automatic.<p>Human expertise can be broken into three levels, the first is strategic planning and takes a lot of mental effort, then there are rules-based responses which are faster, then there is the muscle-memory-like automatic responses. Right now it seems we either manually program in all the rules or else we use 1000s of examples to build up the automatic level, but we don&#x27;t have the strategic level for the AI to build its own rules or the level of using its rules to learn from examples over time. (Though I am not well enough versed in AI to know for sure that we don&#x27;t have pieces of those solutions.)<p>It would also be nice for the AI to be able to take patterns it has learned and articulate them as rules which someone else could learn.",1453920866

So I build the live chat widget inside a separate page, which also looks great and you have enough space to have both the forms and chat in the same view.<p>After talking with some people, I found that this can be useful in other areas than SaaS feedback, especially when you can link to the chat page with a specific form enabled by default, not only during conversation. Basically everywhere you want to gather information(polls,survey) and you also want to respond live or chat.<p>It&#x27;s not officially launched, only 10 free accounts are available for private beta.<p>Please try and and let me know what do you think.<p>Thanks a lot",1453920568

Light hits the eye, and it activates a set of neurons that are wired up to the light receptors. There&#x27;s further out neurons that are set up to catch certain higher-level patterns, like edge detection or objects headed directly toward the eye. Deeper and deeper these connections go, until you get something that you subjectively experience as &quot;seeing&quot;. It&#x27;s at this point that optical illusions work - flat images on paper that are designed to make the higher level visual pattern recognizers fire. At a very high level, how parts of the brain work is by activating based off the sensory data represented by the activation of other parts of the brain.<p>Just like detecting edges in your visual field was important in the ancestral environment, so was answering questions like &quot;what did you do on the hunt?&quot; with a good story. Just like there&#x27;s a portion of the brain the constructs edges from lower-level visual sensation, there&#x27;s a portion of the brain that constructs narratives from lots of different kinds of sensations. Furthermore, this narrative module has access to remembered narratives (since consistent stories are better ones) as another form of sense data.<p>That, in short, is what consciousness is - the brain making sensible stories out of the sense data it encounters, and making those stories available to the brain (including the story-making module, which is why you can make stories about the qualitative experience of story-making).",1453920553

A reasonable estimate for the &quot;fair value&quot; is the midpoint, $95.50. Now, a new sell order for $95.01 arrives at the market. AAPL is now quoted at $95.00 x $95.01. In the absence of other signals, a trader might reason that there&#x27;s something wrong with the guy selling at $95.01 when everyone else thinks fair value is ~$95.50. If so, he&#x27;ll rush to trade against the new order. First one to get there gets shares cheap; everyone else gets nothing. Hold the position for as long as you like.<p>There are a lot of details to get right, but this is an actual HFT strategy, not a toy example. Note that your speed matters only insofar as it lets you trade ahead of everyone else. All the infrastructure investment is required to stay ahead of other participants, but it does not confer a durable advantage: the arms race will quickly erode the edge. The investment is best-viewed as a tax imposed by other HFT firms, paid to technology vendors and exchanges. The big winners are those who sell the equipment and fast lines that certain HFTs desperately need.<p>> What if the regulators decided to ban all HFTs.\nThe market would look pretty similar to how it does today. The big change would be somewhat wider spreads: market makers need to compensate for the additional risk they take on by leaving their orders out. Any other traders here have an opinion?",1453920480

To give a sense of how large a gap that is, there is and has only ever been one Westerner to achieve that rank, Michael Redmond. The article states they plan to face off against Lee Sedol 9p, and if they beat him in a no-handicap game, <i>that</i> will be as impressive as Deep Blue against Kasparov.<p>You&#x27;ll want to watch this year&#x27;s Computer Go UEC Cup[0] in March, with Zen and CrazyStone being the typical victors. (CrazyStone in particular has sustained a 6d rating on KGS, a popular Go server, but lately has been at 5d. In the past it has beaten a 9p with a 4 stone handicap, which is impressive, but that handicap is huge and it hasn&#x27;t yet won with 3 stones.) Of interest this year is that Facebook is competing, and AFAIK they seem to take a similar approach as Google by training the AI using deep learning techniques and then strengthening it further with MCTS. In their public disclosures they claim to beat Pachi pretty often, which puts their bot around 4d-6d, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how it fairs against Zen and CrazyStone in the Cup and if it wins against a 9p.<p>[0] <a href=""http://jsb.cs.uec.ac.jp/~igo/eng/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsb.cs.uec.ac.jp/~igo/eng/</a>",1453919972

It&#x27;s what brought so many immigrants to this country, and is even taught to us in school as being the backbone of capitalism.<p>Most people in America have never actually met a successful entrepreneur. The shop keep down the street is usually under water with loans, and the big successes are corporations headquartered far away, the founders living in expensive seclusion. Heck, in my case it wasn&#x27;t until I arrived in the Bay Area in my early 20&#x27;s before I actually met someone who ran a successful business in person.<p>The successful entrepreneur is this key person in our social mythology, and stays very much a myth to most people. Their success gets spun into compelling stories that give a lot of hope to those who want a way out of poor circumstances. And in an effort to spin stories that sell, journalists (and PR people) often omit key facts, to match the &quot;Self-Made Man&quot; narrative that the people want to hear.<p>So, learning that yes it indeed is mostly myth and that no, not everyone can get a shot at being &quot;Self-Made&quot; - is pulling the curtains back on a long standing cultural deceit. The truth that success is mostly limited to a tiny subset of the population based on mixed factors like wealth, education, location, social values, generational cohort, parental upbringing etc, is a bitter pill to swallow.<p>Eager, but disadvantaged, entrepreneurs have been entering the tech market with this key information being withheld, aiming their sights on holding out for mega VC rounds when they should have been focused on earning a living. This leads to painful failures that could have been prevented.  Had these founders been given the right narrative to begin with, they might have been better aligned to scale of business success that&#x27;s reasonably within their grasp.

Their orders probably never see a real exchange. Instead, internalizers <i>pay extra money</i> to offer brokerage customers the best possible prices for what they&#x27;re looking to trade.<p>That&#x27;s because HFTs aren&#x27;t the apex predator in the markets. Informed institutional traders like Goldman are. Market making operations are built around mitigating the risk of getting run over by giant block trades from institutions. When those happen, they take out whole swathes of the order book and leave adverse price changes in their wake.<p>An electronic market maker will pay a premium to make safe profits off the spread of retail orders, because to a first approximation none of those orders are going to take out the whole book.<p>Meanwhile, among institutional traders, there are two kinds of firms to look at.<p>The first kind, the Royal Banks of Canada of the world, are getting paid a tidy sum of money to make large block trades for the cheapest possible price. The RBC trader has knowledge that the rest of the market doesn&#x27;t: many tens of thousands of shares of something are about to trade, and that trade is going to move the market. They make money by trying to disguise their intent, so that instead of the market price reflecting that intent, they can capture the premium and leave everyone else in the market to hold the bag.<p>Those kinds of traders <i>hate</i> HFT.<p>The other kind, the Vanguards of the world, buy or sell based on long-term strategies. They&#x27;re buying CSCO or MMM to fill out an index. They want the best possible price, of course, but they mostly care about determinism and low cost of trades.<p>Those kinds of traders <i>like</i> HFT. (You can see the Chief Investment Officer of Vanguard, the world&#x27;s most trustworthy mutual fund company, saying that repeatedly and emphatically). HFTs reduce spreads and make trading cheaper, and Vanguard doesn&#x27;t earn profits by taking it out of the hides of their immediate counterparties.<p>As a public policy matter, I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m supposed to support regulations that increase Vanguard&#x27;s cost of trades so that an equities desk at RBC can charge higher premiums to fleece the markets on behalf of their hedge fund clients.",1453919748

Anyone copying the image, who wishes to preserve attribution, must also separately copy the attribution text. Then they need a way to store that text, and keep it associated with the image.

However, that is largely irrelevant because most people don&#x27;t even have that &quot;problem&quot;. Someone could hear that silly adage thousands of times throughout his life, and never find out first-hand whether it is true. Proverbs and adages should have broad applicability.<p>The saying &quot;money won&#x27;t buy you happiness&quot; (and its various other versions) has a purpose: it expresses a kind of exasperated defeatism over not having money and trying to be content anyway. It&#x27;s a version of the human behavior which is exposed in that true piece of wisdom known as the Sour Grapes Fable. The fox cannot reach the grapes, so they are declared sour (i..e <i>If I did reach those grapes, it wouldn&#x27;t make me happy, because they are sour!</i>  We just have to identify the struggle for grapes with money. Most of the time this &quot;cannot buy happiness&quot; adage is not only <i>heard</i> by those who will never experience first-hand whether it is true, but also <i>uttered</i> by those in the same boat.<p>There is a universal truth in it and it is that there exists a human predicament of not being satisified with what one has. It&#x27;s not always possessions. Someone who has lots of possessions might be dissatisfied with something else in their life, and not necessarily the quantity of stuff. Perhaps he or she seeks to be more learned or skilled in something, or to have a different personality. Or to make some mark in the world other than being remembered as someone who had lots of stuff. I can tell you that if you have more money you will be happier in a sense, but you will still strive to achieve some other satisfactions.",1453919289

Your power lines will be bigger, but it scales up with the area.<p>Electricity facts refresher:<p><pre><code>  ohms measure resistance to electricity movement\n  amps measure how many electrons per second you are jamming down a wire\n  volts measure how hard you are jamming the electrons down the wire\n  watts measure power, this is ultimately what you care about\n\n  volts = amps * ohms\n  watts = amps * volts\n\n  this is true for AC and DC\n</code></pre>\nYour copper wire has a resistance of about 17 ohms per kilometer. This wire is allowed to take 3 amps of current when used for power transmission. That makes the voltage drop over a kilometer be 3 * 17, 51 volts.<p>This voltage drop doesn&#x27;t depend on the voltage of your power line, just of the current running through it. If you are Mr. Edison with a 110 volt generator, then you have lost almost half of your power just transmitting it one kilometer.<p>If you are the Pacific DC Intertie sending power from Washington state to Southern California, you are operating at 1000000 volts. You are losing 0.005% of your power per kilometer.<p>The whole AC/DC thing was because in the early 20th century it was easy to change the voltage of AC power but difficult and expensive to change the voltage of DC power. You could pump AC up to higher voltages for transmission, and bring it back down for domestic use.<p>␄<p>† Notes follow:<p>The current limits I used for the wire are for common electrical engineering work on devices, I don&#x27;t know the limits for power transmission lines, but…<p>I sort of doubt they use copper for transmission lines, too expensive, so the resistances will be higher. Wikipedia to the rescue: The Pacific DC Intertie uses aluminum wire, reinforced with steel, with a 644 mm^2 cross section. (Not clear if that is the aluminum of the whole thing.) They are also pushing 3100 amps which puts us in the ballpark, 1000 times the current in 644 times the cross sectional area. They are operating above the power transmission guideline I picked but below the limit for chassis wiring.<p>Also for transmission lines, the much thicker wires will not be able to dissipate heat as well as the tiny wire I used and there will be a derating of their current capacity from that.<p>High frequency AC gets weird, it travels on the outside of the wire and the cross sectional area doesn&#x27;t scale, but 60Hz isn&#x27;t going to do that much.<p>If you think &quot;I know, I&#x27;ll wire my home/datacenter/yacht with 12v DC power!&quot; Then you <i>really</i> care about voltage loss. If you want to move 2000 watts 10 feet with low loss you will be using two copper conductors about the diameter of your thumb. This is why you see 48v used on things like Power Over Ethernet. That is the &quot;low voltage&quot; limit for some regulatory agencies, and they want to get as much power of the tiny conductors as possible.",1453918846

This was the horse. The population of working horses actually peaked in England long after the Industrial Revolution, in 1901, when 3.25 million were at work. Though they had been replaced by rail for long-distance haulage and by steam engines for driving machinery, they still plowed fields, hauled wagons and carriages short distances, pulled boats on the canals, toiled in the pits, and carried armies into battle. But the arrival of the internal combustion engine in the late nineteenth century rapidly displaced these workers, so that by 1924 there were fewer than two million. There was always a wage at which all these horses could have remained employed. But that wage was so low that it did not pay for their feed.<p>-- Greg Clark, A Farewell to Alms<p>The &quot;Lump of Work fallacy&quot; does seem to be a fallacy. However, that didn&#x27;t help the horse. Why is that? The invention of &quot;Artificial General Muscles&quot; in the form of the internal combustion engine was a better-than-perfect replacement for all forms of horse labour. We should expect artificial general intelligence technology to do much the same to humans. There is no law in economics that prevents human wages from declining below subsistence. And a perfect substitute for human labour that requires no wages and is more intelligent would certainly vastly lower the value of human labour.",1453918531

The success of those projects is driving even more to move to Polymer soon.<p>I think Polymer isn&#x27;t as discussed as much as many of the rest is exactly because we don&#x27;t try to take over the entire browser and abstract away the DOM. By working with the DOM, and being entirely based on web components, Polymer is a more incremental evolution (though a revolutionary evolution!) of the browser. That&#x27;s not as exciting to some people as something entirely new and pure.<p>We believe that Polymer will have a very big impact though as we focus on interoperability and easy incremental adoption. Polymer&#x27;s ultimate goal is to play nice with all other component libraries via the web components standards. As that cooper-etition plays out we are going to see a huge varetiy of web components, and styles and methods of implementing them. People will eventually realize that they can use their preferred programming paradigms even within web components, and still interop with other web components.<p>Basically, our goals and strategy are so different, it&#x27;s not surprising to me that what we&#x27;re doing hasn&#x27;t fully caught on yet with everyone :)",1453918429

It was rather longwinded and rambling; shorter ones like you see around are a little more persuasive because they don&#x27;t show the decoherence of the Markov chain&#x27;s context:<p>---<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of H.R. 525 and the association health plans it creates. There are 44 million Americans who are uninsured in this country and this bill will not even affect 1 percent of them. Not 1 percent. CBO found that only 360,000 uninsured Americans would join AHPs. This bill in fact hurts those who enroll in the plans and will even cause healthcare costs to go up for many other Americans. There has to be a better way to help 44 million uninsured Americans. AHPs will not be accountable to state health regulations. This will leave consumers who enroll in these plans without protection or a right to appeal if their cancer or diabetes treatment or medicines are denied. We can not let that happen again.<p>Members in this body are faced with a choice: representing consumers and small businesses, or big oil companies. We should not leave the American people in the integrity of this institution. Perception, as we all know, four hurricanes ravaged my home state of Florida and some of the Gulf coast. Three of them literally destroyed parts of the district that I am privileged to represent.<p>It will not lower their energy prices and it puts in place weak price gouging standards. It also does little to promote additional refining capacity, while gutting important environmental safeguards and creating additional corporate tax breaks. Waiving environmental protections and offering federal tax breaks to oil companies will not entice them to build new oil refineries. While more refineries would certainly help produce more gasoline, oil companies have had the opportunity and financial capability for years to increase their refining capacity. Environmental regulations are not stopping them. Rather, the inability to build profitable refineries has led oil company executives away from constructing or resurrecting them.<p>An alternative to this bill is being offered by Mr. Stupak of Michigan and others. The Stupak bill would strengthen the hands of the Federal Trade Commission and its willingness and ability and resources to enforce the price gouging remedies that we give the FTC.<p>The attorneys general of our states are elected by our constituents, they know the conditions in their states better than we do, they have the resources and the discretion under the substitute to decide whether or not it is in the best interest of both the plan and participants to enhance the independent advice market, and we urge congress to adopt this approach.<p>AARP urges you to stand with us in opposition to these critical provisions in H.R. 2830 in order to provide protections for older workers that are necessary, reasonable and fair, and to ensure that the case is moved along as expeditiously as possible to ensure that workplace hazards are addressed in as timely a manner as possible, thus improving worker safety and health.<p>OSHA, as is almost every other federal agency, is already required by law to pay attorneys&#x27; fees and costs in any proceeding in which it does not win, regardless of why it lost and notwithstanding the fact that the position of the agency was substantially justified. In effect, unless the agency can guarantee that it will win every case it brings, H.R. 742 punishes the OSHA for trying to enforce the law. It also occurs to me that there is a question of the constitutional rights of workers here, that since OSHA is given rather exclusive jurisdiction to protect the rights of our own citizens through regulation.<p>That is wrong. We should not do it to people serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of their country and have served longer deployments than expected.This bill provides important new benefits for our troops and their families need desperately. It includes additional funds for health care services, mental health for veterans, active duty servicemembers and their families, and financial assistance to help members of the national guard and reservist forces lose income when they leave their civilian jobs for active duty.\nThe people of this country.<p>I just think we have struck the wrong balance. We need to sunset this bill again for a shorter period of time, and I hope my colleagues will oppose this bill so we might do this effort in a bipartisan manner.<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my concern about the current state of our nation&#x27;s budget woes. I&#x27;ve been running the family ranch for several years and I know what it means to work within a budget. You may have to count your pennies, but you spend your money where it matters most. We can do that without increasing taxes. First off -- our nation&#x27;s taxpayers deserve an honest budget that gives an account of all future spending. If this administration wants to privatize social security.<p>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to read the resolution that I believe ought to be before us, Mr. Speaker. The record shows otherwise. It is economics, not regulations, that have led to the shortfall in capacity.",1453918154

I don&#x27;t like my box at all:<p>* It doesn&#x27;t store data through power outages: If it loses power, it loses the channel guide and takes maybe 20 min. to reload it. How hard is it to store that data locally?<p>* The channel guide takes ~20 min. to load: How much data could there be?<p>* It wastes energy: It&#x27;s power on state uses 29W; it&#x27;s sleep/off state uses 22W. What does it need 22W for? Think of all those cable boxes in all those homes, sitting there unused and wasting 22W. My cable provider is just imposing this on cost on its customers and the environment. Regulations require other electronics to minimize their off/sleep power usage; something needs to be done here too. (My prior box used 29W on or &quot;off&quot;, so 22W is an improvement.)<p>* The DVR doesn&#x27;t stop/rewind/fast forward responsively, so it often over/undershoots the point in time I&#x27;m seeking.

What&#x27;s important is transmitting electricity at high voltage.<p>Transmission losses come from the amount of current you pass through a conductor. More current equals more power lost to the resistance of the conductor.<p>Delivered electric power is equal to voltage multiplied by current. Higher voltage means lower current for the same amount of delivered power, which means lower transmission losses.<p>The AC versus DC thing comes in because you need lower voltages for practical applications (it&#x27;s hard to run a light bulb off 100kV) and that means you need to transform between different voltages. Transforming AC between different voltages is pretty easy: an AC transformer is basically just a pair of coils with a metal core, easily built with 19th-century technology. Transforming DC is much harder and requires much more advanced technology.<p>For the 19th-century battle, this meant that AC was the only one that could be transmitted at extremely high voltages. DC was limited to serving very small areas because it had to be transmitted at the same voltages which would be used at the destinations.<p>Today, that difference goes away, so the advantages and disadvantages are all about much smaller secondary effects instead.",1453917724

From this same standpoint many contemporary writers have wondered that English capital having grown in that last twenty years so much quicker than English population, wages should not have been more enhanced. But simultaneously with the progress of accumulation there takes place a progressive change in the composition of capital. That part of the aggregate capital which consists of fixed capital, <i>machinery</i>, raw materials, means of production in all possible forms, progressively increases as compared with the other part of capital, which is laid out in wages or in the purchase of labour. This law has been stated in a more or less accurate manner by <i>Mr. Barton, Ricardo, Sismondi, Professor Richard Jones, Professor Ramsey, Cherbuilliez</i>, and others.&quot;<p>(I personally am not a huge fan of Marx&#x27;s writings, mainly because of the strong contempt for humanity that I feel emanating from them... incidentally I&#x27;ve recently stumbled upon this one, though.)<p>A scary analogy in favor of this argument is, a horse cannot economically perform almost any job today, hence most were slaughtered though few were kept for amusement. That happened after horses had a very good run where every improvement in technology increased &quot;horse employment.&quot; If a machine exist to outperform a human in any conceivable job, it&#x27;s not very different (and then you get to the discussion of the political options.)<p>A counterargument is that up until now this argument was wrong many times, and that we&#x27;re very far from an AGI, or even from machines beating humans at every possible task.",1453917704

I also had a salad that day, and a sandwich on whole grain bread. It&#x27;s not like every meal is a big slab of meat and a couple servings of one vegetable.<p>My main dietary planning since early September has been around carbs, because my glucose levels have been creeping up, even though I had not made any dietary changes. My HA1c hit 8.9 early in 2015 [1]. I cut back a bit on sugary drinks, and it dropped to 8.1 by early September. Then I started aiming for no more than 40% of calories from carbs, and by my next test 3 months later it was down to 5.9. I hadn&#x27;t actually <i>intended</i> to cut calories, but as a completely accidental side effect my daily calories ended up half what they were before, so over that 3 months I lost 45 pounds, and have lost another 15 since then. My blood pressure is down noticeably, too.<p>For my 2016 food tracking spreadsheet I added a column specifically for sugar, and am thinking of modifying my &quot;40% from carbs&quot; goal to allow a higher percentage from carbs as long as the percentage specifically from sugar stays down. That will flip a lot more fruits and vegetables and grain-based products into the &quot;go ahead and eat a lot of these&quot; category.<p>From blood tests and food tracking, as far as I can see the only nutrient I&#x27;m low on is protein. I&#x27;m getting on average about 75-80% of what is recommended (based on the 0.36 g of protein per pound you weigh guideline). So, I like to toss in a delicious slab of meat now and then to boost the protein, like I did in my steak and corn dinner the other day.<p>As long as I feel fine, and my blood tests continue showing no problems, I&#x27;m just going to keep on doing what I&#x27;m doing, because it is leading to good steady weight loss and is almost effortless and should be sustainable indefinitely.<p>[1] And yes, this is with medication.",1453917635

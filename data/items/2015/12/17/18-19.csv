This is a large performance penalty right at the time when you can least afford performance penalties.<p>IMNSHO, most modern languages should be storing strings as UTF-8 and give up on random access by characters.  You almost never need it; in the most frequent case where you do (using indexOf or equivalent to search for a substring, and then breaking on it), you can solve the problem by returning a type-safe iterator or index object that contains a byte offset under the hood, and then slicing on that.

Most (or at least much) of the time it&#x27;s really just a more salient and specific version of the &#x27;in-group bias&#x27;. And I&#x27;d argue that on an academic level, researching and discussing it as the latter is vastly preferable to using the much more loaded concept of racism. But on a societal level it perhaps makes sense that we treat &#x27;racism&#x27; as a category in itself.<p>Personally I think discussing whether x is &#x27;just&#x27; a subset of y is less valuable than carefully delineating the contexts in which we use particular terms. For example, I wish that on a societal level we&#x27;d consider &#x27;innate&#x27; differences a bit of a taboo, but that on an academic level we could go wild researching, say, IQ differences of particular populations without it being coopted by politically motivated individuals.<p>I vaguely recall Steven Pinker (almost?) making that argument in The Blank Slate, and even though I&#x27;ve never read Anathem, I understand one theme is the idea of having academics locked up and doing research similar to orders of monks isolating themselves from the world.<p>At the risk of this becoming (even more of) a ramble, I can&#x27;t help but wonder what effect our increasing interconnectedness and the inability to do something in isolation has on all of this.",1450378498

At a complete guess I&#x27;d say maybe 5%?<p>As I said, when I look out at my residential street at 8:50, I see about half of the cars still parked there, or maybe a third (very rough estimates, I haven&#x27;t actually counted). Now, I do live in a city with good public transit options, that&#x27;s also fairly walkable and bikable. But at least where I live, there&#x27;s a pretty serious oversupply of capacity, just because people do need cars occasionally and the options for not owning a car are not good enough.<p>In fact, on the next street over, parking goes way up at around this time since I&#x27;m near a major subway stop, so a lot of people park here and take the subway the rest of the way in. Rather than just sitting there, going back up and shuttling more people to the subway would be a more efficient use of cars that you could do with self driving cars. The commutes from house to subway station are likely under 30 minutes, and since rush hour generally actually lasts about two hours from 7 AM to 9 AM, you could fit a couple of round trips in that time period.<p>> (Also, given zoning and city layout, most houses are a lot more than 5 minutes away from most offices. Even if my commute is 8:20-8:50 and yours is 9:15-9:45, we&#x27;re probably both heading into the city centre from outside, so the same car probably can&#x27;t serve us both).<p>This is increasingly untrue. Mixed use developments, companies moving out to the suburbs for cheaper real estate, people moving back in to the city, and so on mean that reverse commutes are increasingly common.",1450378372

Here&#x27;s what works well for me:<p>* Each week I make one meal from each of the following three categories: soup (or chili), meat oriented (usually chicken, sometimes beef), and pasta (or risotto). I make four servings, so we&#x27;ll have the same meal for two consecutive nights. Each category has four to six different dishes, so even though we eat the same dish two nights in a row we&#x27;re not making it too often. The limited number of dishes means I don&#x27;t have a lot of ingredients in my kitchen that I&#x27;m using infrequently. On the seventh night we&#x27;ll eat out or order in.<p>* A significant number of recipes come from a few different(don&#x27;t laugh) Real Simple books that we own. The recipes are typically, well, simple to prepare, relatively healthy, and don&#x27;t require a lot of time. They call for ingredients I can find without having to go to a specialty grocery store. I also have a few recipes from blogs and NY Times Cooking, which has a back-catalog of thousands of recipes.<p>* Lunches are usually sandwich based, though sometimes extra leftovers. Sandwiches can get boring quickly, so I find adding a lot of ingredients helps. A typically sandwich may be two slices of low sodium turkey, bacon, cheese, broccoli sprouts, and a slice of tomato. For a side I may add in a piece of fruit or a handful of almonds (sometimes plain, sometimes chocolate covered). Usually twice a week I&#x27;ll go out for lunch. Makes it a little more special when it doesn&#x27;t happen every day.<p>* I live in a smaller apartment with limited kitchen space, so I try to use recipes that don&#x27;t require specialty equipment.<p>* I make a list of food I&#x27;ll need for the week on Sunday mornings and make one trip to the store. No going back until next Sunday.<p>* I try to find recipes that will last for a few days in the refrigerator. Most Sundays I&#x27;ll make two recipes, providing us with food for four nights. This means I&#x27;m usually cooking only one night during the work week. Start at around 4:30pm on Sunday, done eating and cleaning up by 7pm.<p>Tonight we&#x27;re having broccoli soup, one of the more &quot;challenging&quot; dishes on my list:<p><a href=""http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017010-seared-broccoli-and-potato-soup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017010-seared-broccoli-a...</a>",1450378319

They provide a 1 time infusion of cash in exchange for a future return of either increased value of their stock or dividends. They only infuse cash when the stocks are released either at IPO or later offering of new stock.<p>The reason stocks are sold is due to cost of capital. A company can make money in a few ways. First is they make a product or service and receive money from customers. Second, they can IPO or some other form of shareholder investments. Third they could finance their needs either with a direct loan or through bond issuance.<p>Now, most bonds are considered junk if they are from a small company, especially one where people are working out of their garage. This means the debt has a rather high rate (because people think you&#x27;re going to default). So now you&#x27;ve got to find a buyer (requires middlemen and their costs) that&#x27;s will to bet on you. Good luck (no seriously I&#x27;d prefer this over opening my company to an IPO).<p>Bank financing is hard to get for pretty much the same reason that bonds are junk. Unless you can show positive cash flow for a few years (you know with your just formed startup and a dream), you probably not going to get a loan. It is due to this that often people, including Elon Musk, self-debt finance via credit cards. Again, ridiculously expensive lending terms.<p>Let&#x27;s say you are making money. That&#x27;s great, you&#x27;re in the top 40% of startups. You are now constrained by the amount of money you make. If you make 100k a year, but need 1mil to bring a new product to market, we&#x27;ll see you in 10 years (probably more like 13 with taxes removed over those years).<p>This brings us to stocks. Find people that are a) suckers, b) chumps or, and good luck o&#x27; bearer of dreams, c) actual believers in your product/service. They buy at the IPO price. Your company gets a percentage because the financial house that offered your stock takes a chunk. VCs might cash out after their sale moratorium ends. But after all of this you have a pile of money. That 1mil product is probably doable now. So is an office complex with open floors, and a coffee machine and free lunches and a dog kennel for when your employees just need to feel something that proves they&#x27;re alive.<p>You also have an asset to back bonds. So you can, after a small period of time, issue bonds.<p>At no point did the shareholders add a penny in value to your product directly. They are just there hoping to the FSM that they can leave your stock at some point with a gain. They DO GET TO BITCH. They can have you legally removed from your own company because you have a long view that says in 10 years doing X, Y, Z will increase this companies value 100 fold, but it won&#x27;t help (probably will hurt) the next 3 quarters.<p>As a stock holder I can say this about other stock holders. Fuck&#x27;em. They get 10-50% return for literally parking their money. As they have more capital related income, they should be taxed as income (outside of reasonably tax-protected vehicles like retirement plans).",1450378082

In most use cases (scripting) lists are much easier to use (no interleaving of side effects) and there is plenty of memory available to force them.<p>Generators also go against the &quot;explicit is better than implicit&quot; mantra.

You&#x27;ll likely break even after ten years (assuming $1.50 cartridges Vs. 10c blades). You&#x27;ll also likely receive a closer shave with a safety razor.<p>That being said... I did the whole safety razor thing. It was fun. But then I switched back to cartridges. Why? In order to get a good close shave with a safety razor while also minimizing the chance of nicks, cuts, and razor burn you need a good quality thick lather.<p>Unfortunately creating a good thick lather can easily take ten minutes. You cannot really use off the shelf shaving foam or gel because it doesn&#x27;t provide enough protection for a safety razor.<p>So ultimately I decided I wanted shaving to be a 10 minute activity in the mornings, and not a 20 minute activity. Also creating lather isn&#x27;t the most fun thing to do first thing after you wake up, in particular if you&#x27;re working it hard (as you should).<p>Cartridges are quick and easy. They&#x27;re the ultimate lazy man&#x27;s solution.

A person “infringes” a patent by practicing each element of a patent claim with respect to one of these acts.

In one of my worst-ever interviews, I had the flu really badly the entire time, and read the signals of all of my interviewers to be both negative regarding my technical chops and negative toward my weakened state. I got the job, and was very well liked. In another trainwreck of an interview where I seriously considered standing up and leaving after getting extreme negative signals, I was offered the job as well-- but I should have paid attention to the negative signals, as they were indicative of larger problems with that group.<p>In other interviews, I&#x27;ve massively overestimated my own performance, seeing positive signals everywhere and being very impressed with myself-- of course, these didn&#x27;t pull through, and my confidence was dashed. In another incidence, I did get the job offer.<p>The most confusing are the interviews in which I don&#x27;t have a strong feeling of doing well or poorly either way-- not the median case, but certainly it happens frequently enough that I&#x27;ve gotten a job where I didn&#x27;t think that I stood out. If anything, these cases are a consolation that others may see something positive that I don&#x27;t see in myself.<p>This tells me that my ability to correctly predict my interview performance is no more efficacious than random chance. I think that there are a few confounding factors which make interviewee measuring interview performance as perceived by the interviewer difficult. Interviews are a time of endless posturing, flagrant lies, propaganda, and overt deception hopefully mingled in with actual mutual interest, excitement, and good will. There are many social signals to keep track of in addition to self-monitoring to ensure the correct outcome.

For starters, if you&#x27;re looking for a _secure_ PRNG most practitioners would strongly advise _against_ the system you described[1]. There&#x27;s a difference between a cryptographically secure algorithm and a secure system. For the overall system to be secure you need to make sure the seed data is secured, which you&#x27;re bound to fail at unless you really know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Providing a &quot;cryptographically secure but not really secure&quot; alternative implemented in user space alongside a &quot;really secure&quot; alternative that&#x27;s been thoroughly vetted would likely just add to the confusion. If you _really_ need secure numbers you should be using the really secure one. The really secure one is almost definitely going to require a syscall worth of overhead, at least, so it&#x27;s _definitely_ going to be slower than a PRNG like xorshift128+ which literally takes a single digit number of CPU cycles.<p>Now to answer your question, if you&#x27;re just talking about a CSPRNG algorithm they&#x27;re probably fast enough for almost every use case. I think there&#x27;s still an argument for some things like array shuffling, but those implementations could go out of their way to use the non-CS algorithm as an optimization. Unfortunately in Javascript land there&#x27;s aren&#x27;t many batteries included, so if you switched Math.random() to use a CSPRNG most people would end up using it for trivial stuff like shuffling arrays. If you&#x27;re talking about a secure system... it&#x27;s probably still fast enough for most things, but it&#x27;s less obvious.<p>[1]<a href=""http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2014/02/25/safely-generate-random-numbers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2014/02/25/safely-generate-random...</a>",1450375318

In order for the scientists to be happy, they need (aside from subsistence food, water, and lowbrow entertainment): luxury food, stimulants, computers, replicators, and secrecy. In my experience, all of the above (save for replicators, which are slated to be essential but not yet developed) are critical to being a scientist.<p>But, how do we produce scientists? By fostering open minded curiosity and its cousin, wonder, then introducing critical thought as a guide once the former two have been established firmly. The path of curiosity inevitably leads toward uncharted territory, and, instead of cautioning against the unknown for fear of failure, we should encourage the young to forge ahead-- this is something that most parents will not do, because the unknown is frightening. To raise a scientist, I assume it might also be helpful (but not ethical) to have a complex series of lies / unprovable or counterfactual stories to tell to the child as though they were truth, so that they may have practice in combating poor thought or ignorance, another critical task that scientists must perform at all times to the best of their ability.<p>In short: first cultivate a hunger for knowledge, and then a hunger for facts, and finally a hunger for truth.",1450375294

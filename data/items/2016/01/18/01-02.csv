10922108,comment,10917328,10921808,0,0,analog31,,,"From the article:<p><i>The top four sources of calories in the average American child’s diet are grain-based desserts, pizza, soda and sports drinks, and bread. One-third eat fast food every single day. More than 90 percent don’t eat enough vegetables. And each year, our children are bombarded by around $2 billion in child-directed food and beverage advertising, much of which promotes the least healthy products.</i><p>If the kids bring their own lunches, those lunches will be crap. I can supply some anecdata on this. My mom taught high school and observed what the kids brought to lunch. I saw it when I did things like chaperone for field trips when my kids were in grade school. One kid&#x27;s lunch was a sack of cookies. And if you want to be a snob for a while (disclaimer: I&#x27;m a bit of a snob), look at what people put in their shopping carts at the supermarket.<p>And it&#x27;s quite noticeable that affluent people buy seemingly healthier food, and are much less obese, likewise for the lunches that their kids bring to school and the physical condition of those kids.<p>And it carries over into adulthood: A large fraction of my colleagues eat restaurant food for lunch, at least a couple times a week. The vast bulk of restaurant food is a pile of sugar, fat, and salt.<p>In my view, the US is not a fancy food country, and what works for us might not be fancy food, but teaching people how to prepare healthy food with modest ingredients. For instance I suspect that a sandwich and an apple would be a vast improvement over what most kids eat for lunch. That&#x27;s all I ever got in the lunch that I brought from home as a kid. When I got old enough, it was my job to make my own sandwich.",1453082354

The two sides of that spectrum are &quot;my kid&#x27;s got the best lunch for him ever&quot; and &quot;my kid&#x27;s got the most awesome lunch the other kids will be jealous of&quot;.  This is why packed lunches should be flat out banned, in my opinion, but I concede that it&#x27;s a parent&#x27;s ultimate choice in how they raise their child.  On the flip side of that, it&#x27;s also their responsibility to do more than write articles about the poor state of food and actually try to do something about it.<p>I&#x27;m far too lazy to find the reference, but I recall that empowering the children to do it themselves has worked more than once.",1453082327

I believe that the cheapest way to run a school cafeteria is to make food from scratch. It is also a much healthier approach.<p>For example, instead of serving pre-made and super-unhealthy chicken nuggets, buy those cuts of meat and fish that are deemed &quot;undesirable&quot; in grocery stores, but perfectly fine in term of health and nutrition. They can be used to make stews, or they can be made into ground meat by the kitchens themselves and in turn made into meatballs, bolognese, lasagna fillings, burgers, fish cakes, etc. The same idea can be applied to vegetables and fruits, too. A large amount of perfectly fine vegetables and fruits are thrown away every day just because they don&#x27;t look nice. They aren&#x27;t rotten. People won&#x27;t get food poisoning after eating them. They just don&#x27;t look good. They are either in odd shapes, too big too small, or have some light bruises, etc. School kitchens can buy them and make perfectly healthy and delicious meals from them.<p>I do see the issue of this approach. It needs cooks who know how to cook from scratch, especially how to cook those cuts of meats they are not familiar with, or cooks who are willing to learn these techniques. I suppose it is much easier to find these cooks in the countries who have a long and rich cuisine history, like France, Italy, China, Mexico, etc. It could be a challenging task here.",1453082164

(Again, why the appeal of proprietary formats for long term storage and future re-encoding?)<p>I did a comparison between FLAC and ALAC (a.k.a. Apple Lossless) on my CD library a few years ago (plus a few 48kHz tracks taken from DVDs), and the difference in total filesize was less than 10% so I doubt that is a major factor. I personally went for ALAC, as it has equal (EAC, VLC) or better support (OS X Finder, iTunes, Windows Explorer, Windows 10 media player, some tagging scripts, iOS) in stuff I currently use. Providing I keep a decoder with the files, its proprietary nature doesn&#x27;t really bother me - I can always convert to xLAC if desired.",1453081341

It&#x27;s amazing, but I suspect not something that would be easy to export, culturally.<p>When I taught English to high school students in Japan, I had a couple of courses where we took over the kitchens and the students had to figure out how to cook meals with English recipes.  I was very impressed with most of them.  Certainly every student had basic cooking skills and could be trusted with every aspect of kitchen safety (and I was in a low level school).<p>One of the downsides to the Japanese school lunch approach is that it puts a burden on teachers.  They are &quot;on duty&quot; during lunch time on a rotating basis.  Japanese teachers get very little down time and extras like this are just expected of them.<p>Lunch is taken very seriously at the schools.  In high school, lunch is not provided.  A local bakery comes by to offer a variety of baked goods at a reasonable price, but you can&#x27;t really trust that there will be decent food left by the time you get there (it is always a mad rush to be first in line at lunch time).  Parents are expected to make a packed lunch.  The teachers will often look at the students&#x27; lunches and if they are not good enough, the parents will be called in.  In extreme cases I have seen teachers teaching parents how to cook nutritious packed lunches.<p>Again, it&#x27;s a good policy which I think would be impossible to export.

However, if you need an id, <a href=""http://pid.codes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pid.codes/</a> has pids for your use for free. USB over DisplayPort, the company almost certainly has paid for a USB vendor ID, for much the same reason.

Radio astronomy needs clear areas of bandwidth so they can look over the sky and analyze, emergency responders need the same so people can be directed quickly, local broadcasters need it so that people can actually broadcast. Cell phones need them so they can communicate with towers. Radio technology is /complicated/ and at higher frequencies, it only gets moreso. That&#x27;s why devices need licensing -- if someone screws up the radio hardware/software, it can easily impact more than themselves.

So, while the choice to praise effort (rather than immediate ability) is a natural consequence of believing that intelligence can improve, it&#x27;s not enough to skip over the point about changeable intelligence, and only praise effort, for example.<p>This makes a lot of sense: if people believe their intelligence is changeable, they&#x27;ll understand the value of effort on their own. More than anything, praising effort is just another way of getting across the point that one&#x27;s intelligence can be improved.",1453079161

Not enough kids know how to cook and I feel this is a reason a lot of the younger generation eats out rather than at home. Having a class rotation where every day of the month (or week, depending how big the school is) a different before-lunch class will instead go to the cafeteria and prep meals would be awesome. Students would get to learn and the school may be able to cut costs by hiring less lunch attendants. Of course kids would have to wash their hands and be trusted not to taint the food, but that goes for current lunch attendants as well.",1453079136

Not just any embodiment either, but we will need to place the neural networks in bodies very much like our own.  Neuroscience continues to find surprising things that link our &quot;general human intelligence&quot; to our bodies.  Paralyze a face and a person becomes less able to feel happiness or anger, eventually forgetting what feeling those things even meant, as one example.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t forget that the mind/body split is a wholly artificial construct that has no basis in reality.  The brain is not contained in the head.  The nerves running down your spine and out to your toes and all over your body are neurons.  Exactly the same neurons, and directly connected to the neurons, that make up what we think of as the separate organ &#x27;the brain&#x27;.  They&#x27;re stretched out very long, from head to toe, sure, but they are single cells, with the exact same behavior and DNA, and there is no reason to presume that they must have some especially insignificant role in our overall intelligence.<p>Then there is the fact that it is probably reasonable to presume that a machine which has human-level intelligence will not appear overnight.  It would almost necessarily go through long periods of development.  During that development, when the machine begins to behave in ways the designers are not able to understand, what will be their reaction?  Will they suppose that maybe the machine had intentions they were unaware of, and that it is acting of its own volition?  Or will they think the system must be flawed, and seek to eliminate the behavior they didn&#x27;t expect or understand?<p>I have a hard time imagining that an AI system will be trained on image classification and one day suddenly say &quot;I am alive&quot; to its authors or users.  If it instead performs poorly on the image classification because it is pondering the beauty of a flower in one of the images, what are the chances that nascent quasi-consciousness would be protected and developed?  I think none.  We only have vague ideas about intelligence and consciousness and our ideas about partial intelligence are utterly theoretical.  Has there ever been a person who was 1% intelligent?  Is mastering checkers, or learning NLP to exclusion of even proprioception 1% of human intelligence?  You optimize for what you measure... and we don&#x27;t know how to measure the things we&#x27;re looking for.",1453079016

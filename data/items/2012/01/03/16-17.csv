Some times helping them understand how the money side of the business works, helps them to understand that the choices they are making are not being done in a vacuum. Especially if you can show them how, a longer development duration can seriously and adversely affect the company. Now where most developers will rightfully get perturbed is when managers want it done fast and don't want to cut or simplify the feature set. You look like you are doing just that, so given your side of the story I would lean to side with you. The other thing to remind them is that you guys can go back and improve those areas once the crunch is over, just live up to your word and support them going back to fix it afterwards. Constant crisis mode sucks and if a developer cannot double back and clean up some unsavory bits that are going to become frustrated as the technical debt grows.

The best tools for packaging, versioning, and testing have always been a bit ambiguous in any language, including Python.<p>However, the author points out something that has always bothered me about Python: it is way harder to start a subprocess with an external command in Python than almost any other language.  This has been true whether using <i>sys</i> or <i>os</i> or even <i>subprocess</i>, which is quite recent.<p>I always felt that this had something to do with the constant warnings in the documentation about how a pipe between the subprocess and the Python process might fill and cause the subprocess to block.  Or how running the program through shell rather than exec or something might cause some sort of security issue.  Are these real issues that other languages ignore in the name of user convenience, or has Python just never been able to make the right API (as the author seems to argue)?",1325608381

3420160,comment,3419671,3419671,0,0,loevborg,,,"I was intrigued by the author's library ""envoy"", which is intended to provide a more intuitive interface to running processes from python. (<a href=""https://github.com/kennethreitz/envoy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kennethreitz/envoy</a>)<p>The back story is that the older APIs that Python comes with -- os.popen and os.system -- are deprecated. Programmers are urged to use the ""subprocess"" module instead. Although this doesn't have the problems of the original functions, it has a rather arcane interface, in particular if you want to read the output (stdout or stderr) of a subprocess.<p>""envoy"" seems to aim at fixing this, by providing sane defaults and being optimized for the common case. However, these defaults have drawbacks of their own.<p>1. envoy defaults to keeping the process output in memory, as a giant string. This can be a bad choice with regard to memory usage and performance.<p>2. You can run several processes in a pipe using (""cat foo | grep bla""). But otherwise as far as I can see, run() ignores regular Shell semantics, such as quotes. I imagine this can lead to unexpected results. The amount of data passed from one process to the next is capped at 10 MB -- recipe for bugs that are hard to find.<p>3. subprocess.call() accepts an array in the style of [""ls"", ""-l"", ""/mnt/My SD card""]. This has obvious advantages over having to deal with escaping shell characters. A good API should preserve this advantage over os.system().<p>4. The defaults cannot be overridden, and no preperations have been made to allow changing them. Of course this can be changed in the future. However, one of the reasons the subprocess.* API is convoluted is that it allows all kinds of flexibility, much of which is needed in many serious programs. It may be difficult to add this flexibility to envoy at a later stage. The point is that a flexible API is hard.<p>None of this is to discourage this initiative, which seems to me a much-needed improvement over Python's built-in API. Also, with a version number as low as 0.0.2, there is probably little need to worry about API compatibility.",1325608278

3420115,story,,,9,16,ThrowAway1q,"Am I a douchebag micromanager?",,"I co-own a small software company.  As a small business, Time to Market is critical.  We are constantly making the tough decisions between doing things quickly and doing things ""the right way"".<p>I recently had several encounters where this conflict boiled to a head with the lead developer of a new product.  I insisted that things be done a certain way, given Time to Market constraints.  I was accused of ""micromanagement"".<p>Below are three scenarios where conflict arose.  Decide how you would design a solution, and then tell me if I am being a douchebag for my insistence on a certain design.<p>Here's a generic description of the application:  A HIPAA compliant web application for patients to use.  Planned development is in .NET, with SQL Server back-end.<p>Design decision #1:  How to handle user passwords.\nOptions:  a) Store as plain text or b) 1-way encrypted.\nBenefits of plain text are - simpler administration, easier for us to pose as a user to duplicate problems, easier to set and reset passwords.  Downside: Security.  Benefits of 1-way encrypted:  security.  Downside: harder to implement, harder to administer.<p>Design Decision #2:  We are recording user's scheduled events in the database, each of which has a date/time attribute.  Since users could be from different time zones, there's a question of how the date is stored in the database.  Say the server is in Eastern Time, and the user is in Pacific Time.  Jobs will be run on the server, based on server time.  Users want to see their information displayed in their local time.  The question is, how do we store the dates and times?<p>Here are a few options:  a) always store it how the user entered it.  b) always store it in local time, and convert it when you display it.  c) always convert it to UTC, and convert it when you display it.  Each has its pros and cons. When selecting a solution, remember to consider Daylight Savings Time, and the fact that not all users will be in zones that implement DST.  Consider ease of management and troubleshooting, ease of implementation, and the fact that we have to run server jobs that compare against the time.<p>Design Decision #3:  Recurring Events.  As mentioned above, events are entered into the web application.  They can recur.  The question is, how do you store recurring events?  Imagine that a user displays May 2012's calendar - then they should see individual events and recurring events that fall in that month.<p>Two options are:  a) Have a SQL table of events, and expand all recurring events to be individual \nentries in this table.  (Note, for infinitely recurring events, you have to implement a stop date, and advance it periodically, perhaps with a daily job.) b) have two tables - one for individual events, and another for recurring events. Merge the results when you display.<p>I thought the answer to these issues were obvious and ""no brainers"", given our emphasis on ""Time to Market"" and Quality products.<p>Am I a douchebag for Dictating that we do the following:  encrypted passwords; use SQL's datetimeoffset (store in UTC), then time zone issues are addressed for you; use a separate table for recurring appointments - better yet, use pre-written code, like DDAY.iCal which has recurring appointments already implemented.<p>PS.  If I had my way, this would be done in a more popular framework, not .NET.  I'd choose Python/Django, but I am open to feedback on that as well.",1325607644

We are all here to learn.<p>But, excessively doing things solely for the sake of ""learning"" is actually doing a disservice to yourself. You should do things with tangible applications to real people besides yourself, too.<p>There are a lot of preliminary or experimental avenues to explore, but once you find a handful with promise, my advice would be to try to follow those more deeply and apply the principles you learned to something with direct applicability.<p>What you'll find is that by turning an experiment into a product, you've actually learned a lot more than you ever thought that little idea could yield up. You'll gain not only depth but also breadth as you explore the implications of that product in various fields, gauge peers' reactions to the product and marketing, and attempt to develop your idea into a repeatable, profitable boon.<p>Tinkering is really important for a lot of reasons, but endless, exclusive tinkering results in a very superficial knowledgebase. I recommend that everyone follow several of their promises tinkers down the rabbit hole and see what comes out of it. I recognize that this takes effort and commitment, but I think you'll often be surprised at the results.",1325606942

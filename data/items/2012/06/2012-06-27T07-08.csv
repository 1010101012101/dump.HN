4166025,comment,4165844,4165844,22,0,saurik,,,"It continues to be dissapointing that new releases of Python continue to be useless due to the (I will claim needless and arbitrary, although I could totally argue the other side if forced: I am not ignorant of the reasons, I just disagree with the opinions) decision to make the new builds incompatible with the previous ones (and in some cases for the obvious worse, such as how Unicode is now less correctly handled when iterating filenames in directories).<p>I mean: I do almost all of my ""business logic"" coding in Python these days, and yet when I hear of a new version of Python it carries as much weight to me as a new version of COBOL (which, honestly, probably has more use cases, and almost certainly more users, than Python 3.x). This is the first time I have simply totally felt stranded by a development environment since Microsoft abandoned Visual Basic and replaced it with ""Visual Fred"" (aka, Visual Basic .NET): and in that case I had already jumped ship to C++ years earlier.<p>At this point, the cost of trying to get all the libraries I rely on set up on 3.x--especially when a ton of them have decided either 1) to slightly change the semantics of the API ""as everything is breaking anyway"" or 2) that they are obsolete and that you should use some other newer library if you want 3.x--is sufficiently high that one may as well switch to an entirely different language (in my case, probably Clojure).",1340783979

Buying doors at $40 doesn't sound lean, the time spent instead of working on the product/service doesn't sound lean. There's an opportunity cost that should be factored in and they could've saved a load of money and time by buying the furniture second hand.<p>Having said all that, it's their business and not mine, and if taking time out to build these desks won't disrupt their schedules or revenue stream then it's up to them if they want to do it. Personally I'd never allow it anywhere I work, but time's much more important (and billable) in my industry so their mileage may vary.<p>Of course, they now have something tangible with their time that reminds them of the day they built their own desks.

As this is my first serious dance with a functional language, I've been compiling a lot of notes and code samples as part of the learning process.<p>A thought has wedged its way into my brain; I'd like to take my informal scraps of knowledge, put together an ebook and sell it.

Heck, I've done some websites, written some scripts, done some sys admin stuff, but I'm just an average guy with average skills.<p>I know credibility helps sell copies, but I kinda feel like selling such a product would be (for lack of a better word) cheating people. To be honest, this thought has surfaced in other ideas as well. I find myself unable to create and sell things, despite a >tremendous< urge to do so.<p>I'm just a mere mortal.

4166017,comment,4164941,4165332,2,0,Variance,,,"I want to make an important note here: trading is not a zero-sum game. It generates value through the exact mechanisms that you noted, market making (liquidity) and inefficiency elimination (accuracy). Via the efficient market hypothesis, the value created by adding this asset liquidity and price accuracy finds its way back into the hands of the traders, often through real value increases in the assets going to traders with call positions.<p>This functions to keep demand for trading moving by making the average market return stay close to or above the market discount rate. So stock trading doesn't end up as zero-sum, but rather benefits parties at the market discount rate. If it didn't, no one would trade but those seeking to gamble, and there would be no notion of fundamental analysis in the market.<p>In reality, outside of an ideally efficient market, it's easy to intuitively suspect that the average return associated with trading is above the discount rate, and that more savvy investors obviously earn higher returns. This is more or less correct: the S&P averaged around 8.5% annual returns over the last few decades [1], and that only increases the farther you go back and lower the more recent your range's early bound is, corroborating the association between unideal market efficiency and high returns. Both ""investing"" and ""trading"" are less distinct in the stock market than in, say, VC, and so that 8.5% applies equally in aggregate.<p>But trading is most certainly not a zero-sum game. Like all market activity, it converges to producing value at the market discount rate in an efficient market. What that rate is is incredibly hard to say, but it can vaguely be associated with S&P returns, which have hovered around 5-6% in recent years on time-weighted rolling averages.<p>[1]<a href=""http://moneyover55.about.com/od/howtoinvest/a/marketreturns.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moneyover55.about.com/od/howtoinvest/a/marketreturns....</a>",1340783836

4166014,comment,4164941,4164941,1,0,asto,,,"If a person is successful in one business should we subject ourselves to his idiotic views on another business?<p><i>By definition they cant go into an equity unless there already is liquidity.</i><p>HFTs who are usually market makers [1] maintain liquidity in the market by constantly having buy/sell orders open for many instruments/scrips. In their absence, a counter trade may not exist for matching against when you or I put out a sell/buy order. Being able to sell/buy a scrip/instrument within seconds is a valuable service that investors appreciate. In India, the securities exchange regulator mandates that all market makers make a minimum value of trades per day. I am not sure of the exact current values in each segment but it's in the order of millions of rupees. This is how regulators create conditions of liquidity so that markets are nicer to trade in especially for retail investors.<p><i>The missing link in all the discussions is: What is the purpose of the stock market?</i><p>The stock market can be divided into a primary market and a secondary market. The primary market exists to finance companies. When they IPO, cash is generated which they can use to fund business activities. The secondary market exists to encourage purchases in the primary market and to efficiently discover the price of the securities. Without a liquid secondary market, very few investors would be interested in a primary market.<p>HFT is only doing what was already done since many years ago manually. Humans make the same mistakes computers are being programmed to make today. In their defence, they execute exactly as asked - they feel no fear, doubt or greed - unlike a human trader . Should we treat them as being harmful because computers make mistakes at a significantly faster rate? HFT is a still nascent concept. With sufficient regulation, we will likely be able to get rid of the problems and retain the advantages.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker</a>",1340783663

How sad.<p>Human beings believe things without a shred of credible evidence all the time. In fact, taking things on faith is a valuable, even vital intellectual short-cut that allows us to get on with doing stuff without having to work out every detail of our lives from first principles all the time.<p>I happen to believe that this explains belief in god, i.e. that it's an intellectual short-cut that allows societies to construct functional moral and social frameworks that historically have served a valuable purpose. Frameworks that nowadays are not so valuable because we now have well worked out philosophies of life and morality that render divine fiat unnecessary to leading a healthy, productive and satisfying life. I see religious as being a vestigial social construct that is withering away as it's nolonger required.<p>However I am also very much aware that I still use all sorts of intellectual short-cuts and assumptions every day. Anyone who thinks human beings are inherently rational logical beings is IMHO delusional. We are primarily emotional, instinctual beings overlayed with thin layer of self awareness and congnition.<p>Therefore I think there's plenty of scope for sensible people to adhere to religious belief systems if they so choose, as long as they don't expect special rights and privileges for doing so.

4165956,comment,4161664,4163282,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I disagree with you on NULL.  The relational model is a very good way of looking at data in many contexts.<p>The problem actually is that NULL has several distinct meanings and there is often no real way to differentiate between them other than to disallow all meanings but one, and that is often difficult.<p>For example you talk about nullable columns, and this is one aspect of NULLs.  NULLs may mean missing data.  They also are often used to mean the data doesn't apply.  This already runs you into ambiguity problems because you can't type in a query that easily distinguishes whether the attribute doesn't apply or is merely unknown.  Note that Oracle treats NULL strings as equivalent to empty strings, while PostgreSQL tries to differentiate strings by allowing empty strings which are distinct thus allowing a not-applicable value for character string fields.<p>Additionally, you would expect the || operator to handle unknown data differently than it does data which doesn't apply.  string || not_applicable should equal string.  string || unknown should equal unknown.<p>Now that's only the beginning of the problem.  There is a third use of NULLs too, namely as a placeholder for missing rows in outer joins......<p>If we had three different NULL values some of this problem would be more manageable, but the problem is that as soon as you allow nulls in columns, you can't always easily tell from a query on a well-normalized database what that NULL means without a lot of additional introspection of the representative of the entity set and then you are basically guessing.",1340782061

4165920,comment,4164941,4165458,6,0,zhoutong,,,"This is not efficient. If you use interval bidding, there will frequently be gaps in market prices. Remember that at any instant, the order book (bids and asks) represents only a small portion of market sentiment (real demand and supply). The market prices move smoothly when people are able to react to order changes and price spikes. If it's a black box, it's very easy to manipulate the market in a massive scale.<p>For example, AAPL is $600 now. Under your system, $600 is the price that generated the highest volume in previous bidding event. (There will be sellers placing orders under $600, and buyers over $600 - they'll all be settled at $600 and the exchange obviously wants to maximize this overlap, hence the price). If a large institutional investor wants to manipulate the price, he can place huge buy and sell orders at $700. And very likely in the next bidding event the price of AAPL will move to close to $700, because that will be the price that maximizes the overlap. This is almost impossible in current market system, because you have to continuously buy from all the sellers who are willing to sell at $700 to get the price. Meanwhile, traders (especially day traders) will add to the order book to take advantage of this irrational move. In a black box, irrational moves can't be detected and corrected by other market participants. So you can't really get the idea of the actual matching price in a black box system.<p>When you place a buy order, if there's overlap with any sell orders, it should be matched and executed instantly. Otherwise it will stay in the book to wait for sell orders. The market equilibrium is reached when the spread is minimal and no trade occurs. (Yes, this is in theory.) However, in your ""efficient"" system, there's no market equilibrium, because buyers and sellers are discouraged from making their real demand and supply invisible. The exchange has the incentive to maximize trade volume, so the only way to result in zero volume is no overlapping orders in the entire interval, even when the buyers are sellers have no knowledge of any orders. This only happens when people have no confidence or interest to trade at all. Again, it makes market vulnerable to be manipulated.<p>In China, stock exchanges partially adopted your idea. In Shanghai Securities Exchange, the first 10 minutes (9.15am to 9.25am) of the day is set to be non-continuous bidding period. In Shenzhen Securities Exchange, the first 10 mins and last 3 mins are the same. This was introduced to reduce market manipulation because the order book is empty at the beginning of the day. However, after the period, trade starts continuously and all remainder orders in the bidding event will automatically enter the order book. This way, the price movement of the whole day is smooth with minimal spikes, while the opening and closing prices reflect market sentiment more accurately.<p>Generally, the more the visible orders, the more smoothed the price. Interval bidding discourages order placement because the next price is absolutely unpredictable. It can be adopted in extremely illiquid market situations though.",1340781139

However, like you my experience has been much more positive.<p>My take is similar to what others have mentioned in their comments: meditation is but one of a number of legs on which true happiness stands. It is through meditation that one gets glimpses of what Buddhists call the ""nature of mind"". These only remain glimpses until you build the other legs: boddhicitta (poorly translated into English as compassion) and a deep-seated realization that all things are impermanent. The practice of boddhicitta and the understanding of impermanence, among others, are the antidote to ego or the concept of the self, the prime cause of all suffering which arises from the desire and craving that comes part and parcel with ego. Boddhicitta requires the building of a thought process of thinking more of others, and gradual surrender of the desires for oneself (less of I, me, mine, etc). Practice all these elements together with meditation and I'm pretty certain one can only be the better for it. In my opinion Kenji is lacking the other aspects without which meditation can't provide happiness.<p>It's worth noting that ""happiness"" is a loaded term, quite different for different people. I'm taking a good guess that in it's ultimate form, Buddhist masters would equate happiness with enlightenment with nature of mind, which is what one sees glimpses of while meditating. IMHO, that itself is something to chew upon.",1340780745

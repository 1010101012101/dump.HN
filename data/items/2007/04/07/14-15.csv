10044,comment,10044,9770,0,0,rsheridan6,,,"I wouldn't count them out just yet.  It's true that they can't kill a web 2.0 businesses like youtube the way they could kill desktop-based competitors in the past, but don't forget that the browser itself is a desktop-based app.<p>If I controlled MS, I would try to develop a better platform for web apps than Firefox (which is definitely possible).  I'd use patent-encumbered APIs, which I would share while trying to build market share, and then force my competitors to stop using once they were entrenched.  Maybe somebody smarter than me could come up with a better idea, but the point is that it's probably still possible for them to leverage their OS near-monopoly into a web near-monopoly.<p>It would have been far easier for them if they had started earlier.  Firefox would have been easy to kill 3 or 4 years ago.  But MSFT has so much money and such a large installed base that they can get away with a lot of screw ups before they really cease to be a threat.<p>I agree that, for the time being, entrepreneurs don't really have to worry about MS.  But they're not really dead.  They're just comatose.",1175956130

10041,comment,10001,10017,0,0,blader,,,"I was thinking more of the latency involved in making the roundtrip request from the app server to S3, which is probably on the order of tenths of a second. It would force you to rely heavily on a local memcached to achieve acceptable performance (which is probably a good thing anyway).<p>I'm reminded of a conversation with Facebook's CTO at Startup School, and he mentioned that they experimented with S3 for their photo hosting, but the latency of loading images from S3 made it unacceptable by their performance standards.",1175955753

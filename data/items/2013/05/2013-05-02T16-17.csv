The humility comes from growth over time and being able to remember doing work they'd consider terribly flawed today.  If you're working with arrogant people, they're probably not growing and it'll make it harder for you to as well.",1367513992

I have hired a coach to help me grow my business, but I'm also attending SCORE meetings. SCORE is free, and the coach is far from it. Sometimes, they both provide similar advice, but when they differ.. guess which one I trust more?<p>Your job as the author is to set up the expectations so that when I read this book I can have a sense of what it's worth to me to read. If I can take the knowledge from this to save $25,000, it's worth a whole lot more to me than $20.<p>The price should be based on the value I can expect from the book, not because other people thought of a number that sounded good. In practical terms, what everyone thinks is useless. The results are what determine the value of what you're sharing.",1367513979

This round does include the first server-side template test.  We'd like to hear the community's opinions about more tests.<p>That said, I feel most of the frameworks' implementations of the existing tests are <i>not</i> cheating.  Our objective in this project is to measure every framework with realistic production-style implementation of the tests.  No doubt there is temptation to trim out unnecessary functionality and focus on the benchmark's particular behavior.  We have attempted to identify any such tests that remove framework features to target the benchmark as ""Stripped"" and those can now be filtered out from the list.<p>In other words, our aim is that the implementation of each framework's test is idiomatic to that framework and platform.  And if that's not the case for a test, we want to correct it.<p>Your concern could be clarified by pointing out that framework authors may be tuning up their JSON serialization, database connection pools, and template processing in order to improve their position on these charts.  And, to be clear, I have already seen evidence of that in my interaction with framework authors.  To that concern, however, I would say: <i>That is awesome</i>.  <i>I want those features to be fast</i>.",1367513862

If there were a market for hands free displays, there's nothing stopping us from having one for our smartphones just like Bluetooth earpieces.<p>Right, because the only reason things don't exist is because there's no market for it. Google spent several years iterating and trying to get the Glass into a workable size (it was originally basically a smartphone strapped to a pair of glasses), and there was no way it could be in a small enough package until very recently.<p>> Yes, by a small fringe element of idiots.<p>Most people seem to either want one, or are relatively apathetic, so either most people don't think it looks stupid or they think the penalty of looking stupid is worth it for the benefits.<p>> Why do you think all of the Google hype videos for Glass show the same exact thing over and over again; somebody doing something exciting and videoing it with Glass? Because that's the ONLY use case for it. I would assert that it's a terrible use case too, but even if I don't argue that point, that single use case is not enough for Glass to see widespread adoption.<p>Except for the videos with people doing mundane things like biking, playing in the park, or trying to catch a train? If you ignore 1 or 2 sky diving videos, almost all of the videos with Glass I've seen were situations I'm in daily or frequently enough that they aren't exceptional situations.",1367513336

5645664,comment,5643409,5644919,3,0,mnicole,,,"Thanks Dan, I always enjoy your posts in these threads. Your second paragraph is exactly why this is a big deal and why I always grit my teeth when someone says <i>women don't work in tech because they aren't interested in tech</i>, just as some of the commenters on that article do.<p>My problem with this blog entry -- besides the fact that posts like these garner all sorts of self-pats-on-the-back from men who already outnumber women exponentially, thus making those dealing with these issues feel even smaller than they already do -- is that no one is asking for special treatment. They are just asking for the situations in your post to be out of the picture. I don't know where these phantom extremist tech feminists are that are going around telling people that we need to separate to coexist that people keep complaining about. What I know is that many women seek solace in private mailing lists and women-only coding clubs is because they've experienced enough frustration that they need an outlet to scream and a place to make sure that they're not being irrational or interpreting a situation wrong.<p>The <i>author</i> may be comfortable in her own skin, and <i>she</i> may be able to shake off any ill-will towards her, but not wanting to be treated like an idiot at your job is hardly gender-specific. Men are just as likely to be in that position, but their validation-over-time happens more quickly. They are able to bounce back. They are seen as confident and worthy when they ask for their raises and promotions, as opposed to how women are seen in the same situation.<p>At the end of the day, I think posts like these are just as destructive as ones like Shanley's (<a href=""https://medium.com/women-and-work/405b2d12d213"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/women-and-work/405b2d12d213</a>). Both speak to two sides of the same coin, but unfortunately they take the attitude that their experiences are the only experiences, and thus, here is a guilt-tripping one-size-fits-all solution.<p>A great post on the issue of trying to deal with not talking about gender inequality while dealing with gender inequality is by comedian Sara Schaefer, titled ""Taco at the sausage party"": <a href=""https://medium.com/gender-justice-feminism/66fa6d700af2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/gender-justice-feminism/66fa6d700af2</a><p>Even if you attempt to ignore everything going on around you, it doesn't change what people are saying and doing about you. At some point, you crack, no matter how much you have been trying to avoid doing so. The attitude shift needs to happen across the board.",1367513311

Answer: Labor.<p>Where did this labor come from? Answer: Children.<p>Farm families are historically speaking very large. Much larger than what a hunter/gatherer could possible support.<p>A woman might have 12-15 children, and since you have a food supply, many of them will survive to adulthood.

You and I know that the squeaking noises and the bite marks have the same underlying cause, but Bayes's rule is useful in situations where cause-and-effect remain unknown.

I tried out numerous scheme ecosystems and fell in love with chicken very quickly.<p>Since I found chicken scheme I have used it do everything I can. I have built numerous web applications using it and it always makes my happy inside; something I can't say for other ecosystems. It also works great for scripts and interfacing to system libraries.<p>And of course the community is amazing. Even when I was new to lisp and chicken my questions and patches were always taken seriously and responses are always kind and helpful.<p>As felix mentions chicken scheme is really fast. Even on websites with moderate load and very little performance profiling or caching my dynamic pages are very consistently generated in less than <20ms. If you go a bit further and give the compiler hints it gets even faster. And if it isn't fast enough yet you can embed C code straight in your lisp source files.<p>It is tough to beat a language and ecosystem that nearly never gets in the way, is easy for rapid prototyping, and gets great performance when you need it.<p>As mentioned, Henry Bakers ""Cheney on the M.T.A""[1] is a great read. I have used it to implement a scheme system as well.<p>In summary: use chicken scheme if you want a nearly mature, production ready, rapid prototyping, statically or dynamically typed, fast, easy to use, and powerful language and ecosystem.<p>edit: Another really cool feature of chicken scheme is the ability to serialize continuations. It can be used to make an extremely powerful stateful web app that operates like arc and hacker news.[2] Since you can serialize the continuations you can write the state to a file and you won't lose the state when you restart the app or the server crashes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/CheneyMTA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/CheneyMTA.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/suspension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/suspension</a> and <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/arcchallenge.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/arcchallenge.html</a>",1367511154

To the extent that I'm half conscious to these other things, I was actually fully conscious to them though for only a few number of clocks, whereas things on which I seem to be fully conscious are demanding the majority of my (multi)processor clocks. There's the case for whether we can truly multitask--are we multi-core? We definitely are as to the many functions done subconsciously, but what about the conscious regions of the brain? But to simplify the thought experiment, we can simply think that we can only really spend any single moment of awareness on a single atomic thing, and like a computer we juggle attention between various things so fast as to make it seem we're doing them all concurrently (like the various applications simultaneously running on a computer.)<p>The upside, of course, is that my philosophy frees me up for gultfree teletransportation.

The attitude is changing, and watching the younger generation for innovative product adoption is going to be key in determining success.<p>Think about initial smartphone adoption. You could've argued that they provided little benefit over a laptop for many features. The displays were small with low resolution, web connectivity was slow, websites weren't optimized for mobile, and the cameras were pieces of rubber duckies. But they were cool, and people found a use for them as technology improved. As techies, we should absolutely not be dismissing first-generation tech.<p>Yes, voice control is freaking awkward, but there are solutions to that. Thalmic Labs, for example, is coming out with the MYO (go watch the video) which would be perfect for interacting with Google Glass. Make a hand gesture to take a picture, instead of taking out your phone and positioning it? Seems like a natural fit to me.<p>I'm guessing Google Glass will converge around the $400-$700 price range, possibly with more than one model. Youth adoption will probably drive overall consumer adoption. As with a lot of new stuff like this, it's easy to say you don't need it. It's harder to say you don't want it after you have it.",1367510932

5645377,comment,5644421,5644882,2,0,BoredAstronaut,,,"I think the deeper question that is being ignored is that of how we decide what is valuable: how we measure value. The market approach that is being espoused, and favoured by some here, reduces everything to a dollar amount. This is convenient, especially from an algorithmic standpoint, since then your algorithms can process any kind of input.<p>But this is a pretty big assumption. I'm not saying that you can't put a price on anything--you can. But that doesn't mean that the price is accurate, in terms of the value acquired, which is what some other people are trying to point out. The market assumes you can rationally determine the real value of things, in money terms, and compare all things equivalently. But the future utility of something, let alone knowledge, is impossible to measure with any hope of accuracy.<p>If everybody measures everything with money based on some expectation of value--itself measured in terms of the return on investment of existing money/time--and most people are wrong, then it might have very bad long-term consequences for individuals and society.<p>Lots of things are lost when we replace one way of doing things with another way, and usually the dollar value of those things is never considered, but is externalized and conveniently forgotten. Same is true for the way we treat the value of natural resources (air, water, wildlife, minerals) as zero until exploited. It's a pragmatic necessity, enforced by the limits of our measuring tools, but that doesn't mean that nothing is lost.<p>So, when you say ""standards of living have increased"", what measures are being used? Past the essentials (food/water/housing/clothing/security), we get into very grey areas. Knowledge and ways of life are changing, and maybe the loss is more costly than people are willing to admit in the rush for material prosperity.",1367510684

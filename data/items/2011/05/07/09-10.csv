2523523,comment,2523408,2523425,2,0,redthrowaway,,,"Jumping on the socialism badwagon in response to concerns over income inequality is not a well-considered view. The American economy is predicated upon consumerism, which requires a strong middle class. Nobody is saying we should take from the rich and give to the poor, rather we are saying that those [productive] members of society who find themselves marginalized by the increasing polarity of capital are the primary drivers of the economy that produces that capital in the first place. It's not about taxing the rich and giving to the poor, it's about ensuring that the burden if taxation is shared equally and that the benefits thereof are invested in education and other programs that ensure continued competitiveness.",1304761962

2523521,comment,2523408,2523513,2,0,corin_,,,"There's plenty of problems with the system, including people who are able to get far more than they should out of it, and people who don't get enough from it. That doesn't mean we should scrap it entirely.<p>A counterpoint example (although this is from the UK, but similar thing). When my sister was unemployed a couple of years ago, she signed up for unemployment benefits (""job seekers allowance""). That was something pretty low like maybe USD$100/week, but it was OK as she was living with parents and not paying rent. The purpose of job seekers allowance is, as the name suggests, to support people looking for work, and you stay on it you are meant to regularly prove that you are doing your best to find a job.<p>What she found was that, while she <i>genuinely</i> wanted a job, and wasn't picky (she wasn't thinking ""I need to get a job suited to my skill set in a really specific industry"", she would have been happy in a supermarket), the government staff that she had to see twice a month clearly didn't care about helping her find a job, and didn't even care about checking whether she was trying to find a job herself. To them it was all about ticking her off on a list and paying her the money.<p>That's really terrible, because it means that if you want to get benefits instead of working it's incredibly easy, and because, if they had bothered to help her find work sooner, she would have spent less time getting benefits, therefore taking less money out of the system.<p>So, was the system good in this example? No, it was terrible. But, at the same time, because she couldn't find a job, she did <i>need</i> the system, and she would have been much worse off if it didn't exist.",1304761919

2523499,comment,2521144,2522527,1,0,lloeki,,,"__del__ is actually perfectly deterministic in the moment it is called: as soon as the reference count reaches zero. See <a href=""http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del...</a><p>So when does it gets decremented? When the variable gets out of scope, or voluntarily when you call 'del', just as in C++ or D. The difference lies in the notion of scope which is just different than of the one of C/C++/D/Java/C#.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>    from __future__ import print_function\n\n    class Foo:\n        def __init__(self, text):\n            self.text = text\n\n        def __del__(self):\n           print(""deleting %s"" % self)\n\n        def __str__(self):\n            return (""%r(%s)"" % (self,self.text))\n\n    def bar():\n        if True:\n            print(""+scope 1 in bar"")\n            f = Foo(""in bar"")\n            print(""-scope 1 in bar"")\n\n    if True:\n        print(""+scope 1"")\n        bar()\n        print(""bar quit"")\n        if True:\n            print(""+scope 2"")\n            f = Foo(""global"")\n            print(""-scope 2"")\n        print(f)\n        print(""-scope 1"")\n</code></pre>\nwill output:<p><pre><code>    +scope 1\n    +scope 1 in bar\n    -scope 1 in bar\n    deleting <__main__.Foo instance at 0x1004d4a70>(in bar)\n    bar quit\n    +scope 2\n    -scope 2\n    <__main__.Foo instance at 0x1004d4a70>(global)\n    -scope 1\n    deleting <__main__.Foo instance at 0x1004d4a70>(global)\n</code></pre>\nBy now you have noticed that the scope is function-wide (or module-wide for global code).<p>So you can write the exact same code that he wrote in C++ in python and it would work the exact same way, and it doesn't create the Java dispose() mess of slide 12.<p>There is a twist though. Exceptions. Say you have an uncaught exception raised in bar(), then the Foo object created in bar() will be referenced in the stack frame of the exception, which belongs to the caller of bar(), so the Foo object reference count will drop to zero only after the caller scope closes.<p>Try it for yourself by adding this function:<p><pre><code>   def baz():\n     try:\n         bar()\n     except:\n         print(""caught"")\n</code></pre>\nand calling it in place of bar() after ""+scope 1"", while raising any exception in bar().<p>If you want to override this behavior you can just as well call del when you want to get rid of the object, which is just as forgettable as adding 'scope' to variables declarations in the author's almighty D.<p>An interesting task is to examine (and why not, control) the gc behavior with the gc module (<a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/gc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/gc.html</a>)",1304761036
2523498,comment,2523408,2523467,8,0,lionhearted,,,"> You really gotta wonder how this is gonna turn out. How are dumb people supposed to earn a living when technology makes all the jobs for dumb people obsolete?<p>Every time new automation is invented, people think is going to happen. Seriously, this goes back to pre-Industrial Revolution times. Any time part of the labor process is automated away, people think that there's going to be permanent economic damage, and they're consistently wrong.<p>We'll adapt. There's always new things to be done. Personally, I'm betting on a greater diversity of creative and artistic work happening - people in core industries that are going to remain and grow in profitability (technology, raw materials, energy, consumer goods, construction, etc) will have more surplus income to spend on personalization, customization, different and more unique kinds of entertainment, etc.<p>We're going to seem a massive boom in people able to make a basic living from pure creative professions enabled. There'll also be more personal services offered. Ideally a lot of ineffective governmental costs can be optimized down, and more of government spending can go to refining and cleaning up the environment too, planting more trees and flora and fauna, things like that.<p>I think a lot of excellent jobs that don't exist today are going to be created. I also think many more people will learn basic technology skills than perhaps is commonly thought. A few hundred years ago, no one - and I mean <i>no one</i> - would have believed you if you told them what literacy rates would be in developed countries. They just wouldn't think it possible. So, more people will get on the tech bandwagon as time passes and kids grow up with it. Computer literacy will become like language literacy.<p>Good things are happening man, we're living in the greatest era ever. God damn I'm so optimistic and grateful to be alive right now.",1304760955

So, you might become the richest man in the world, or you might live a life in poverty and unemployment.<p>As to why it matters, should people dying of hunger in the third world be ignored? Should we not care about homeless people who are sleeping in the cold and wet and will have crazily low life expectancy and a terrible standard of living?<p>I'm not sure where the 20% comes from or how accurate an estimate that is, but the more fortunate should always do their part, whether through legislation (such as taxation) or charity, to help the less fortunate. While different people will have different views on many areas of this, such as to what extent they should be helped, how badly off you have to be to deserve it, and so on and so on, I think <i>very</i> few would say that the bottom end of society deserves no help at all.",1304760134

The funny thing is that I've never read a book or even so much as a blog post on what makes a design good.<p>Here's the most helpful tip you'll ever receive: find something beautiful and copy it exactly, pixel for pixel.  You can start as small as you feel comfortable - a button, an icon, even a nice shadow.  From there, work your way up.  At this point, don't worry about being original.  Duplicating existing design will help you in so many ways.  You'll become acquainted with the design software of choice.  You'll learn about tools and menus that you never new existed.  You'll discover neat techniques, and you'll notice details that you overlooked before.  As you work, you'll start to understand why things fit together the way they do.  You'll see that some elements work together and some don't. Pick out pieces from different designs and mash them together.<p>And here's a secret: nobody gets a design right on the first try. Experiment, experiment, experiment!  If something looks a bit off, adjust it. You probably won't know exactly how to adjust it, so tweak the element in every way you can think of. Resize, change the color, adjust the stroke or gradient. Eventually it will look right.<p>[1] <a href=""http://letspocket.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://letspocket.com</a>, <a href=""http://madebyloren.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://madebyloren.com</a>, <a href=""http://snowday2011.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://snowday2011.com</a>, <a href=""http://boxify.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boxify.me</a> are a few of the designs I've worked on recently",1304759106

If the repository exported a list of ""mirrors"" to the client that it then stored and was willing to use, that would be awesome, but otherwise you have a million people out there who are now just getting error messages when they do ""git pull"" and the only fix is for them to go back to your web page and try to get information on what is happening and where else they can switch their origin. Meanwhile, if you do your own hosting you can just update your DNS to point to another box and no one is the wiser.<p>They key problem, frankly, is that GitHub conflates two entirely unrelated things: a nice UI and social features, and a hosted version of your repo. I love the idea of outsourcing a nice UI and having cool social features, and /maybe/ to make those features work they need to have a mirror of my repository (I'm not convinced), but when people go to pull it the URL listed should be the actual upstream ""I own the DNS on this and feel I can make this stable in the long term"", not the GitHub mirror.",1296361122

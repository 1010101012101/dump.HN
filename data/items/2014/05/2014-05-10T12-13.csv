Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear\n  tells us what we have to do.\n\n  Remember our rule of thumb: The more scared we are of a \n  work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to\n  do it.\n\n  - Steven Pressfield\n\n  I try never to be governed by fear; that&#x27;s how I choose\n  things. If I ever feel that this is dangerous or I&#x27;m\n  scared of it, then that probably draws me more towards it.\n\n  - Nicole Kidman\n\n  If you&#x27;re not worrying that something you&#x27;re making will\n  come out badly, or that you won&#x27;t be able to understand\n  something you&#x27;re studying, then it isn&#x27;t hard enough.\n  There has to be suspense.\n\n  - Paul Graham\n</code></pre>\nBut like other people in this thread said, it&#x27;s important to not be afraid of making mistakes.<p><pre><code>  Nothing will stop you being creative so effectively as\n  the fear of making a mistake.\n\n  - John Cleese\n</code></pre>\nSo how do you deal with inferiority? Pressure yourself to not have expectations. Expectations kill creativity. Creative people might have a childlike state partly to counteract pressure of expectations, which then frees them to have thoughts their unconscious felt it wasn&#x27;t allowed to have otherwise.<p><i>(low EQ)</i><p>I&#x27;m going on a limb here, but personally I make a lot of programming decisions emotionally. When something smells off with the design of a solution it makes me grow uncomfortable in playing along, and that turns out to be a good thing because it leads to a better solution.<p>I wonder how many other programmers either are, or choose to confess they are, emotional in how they choose what to program.",1399726557

With mate the caffeine rush is much better, I stay more focussed and can concentrate more easily. I am not as restless. Yet it is possible to overdose.

Consider:<p>1) Sun (and now by proxy, Oracle) made a huge investment in engineering to make Java, and a big part of its success was a API for the standard lib that maintained a coherence across disparate domains ranging from file systems to networking to databases to cryptography to UIs.<p>2) Sun made an even more massive investment in marketing to make Java as prevalent as it is today. Without marketing a language goes nowhere, and yet Java is ubiquitous. Along with 1), this represents a massive economic investment.<p>3) Google had no inclination of investing its own time, money and resources to build its own ecosystem and build developer mindshare for it, not when it was trying to compete with the iPhone and wanted warm bodies to build apps for their platform. To make it worse, Google&#x27;s engineers and executives <i>knew</i> that a) they had no better alternatives and would require a license (google &quot;Lindholm email&quot;), and b) that they were not going to be complying with Sun&#x27;s terms (Ctrl-F &quot;Rubin&quot; on this page).

Sure, the implementation is also difficult to do well, but making that implementation <i>usable</i> by others is no less a creative task. The &quot;table of contents&quot; analogy is backwards: you don&#x27;t write the code first and then extract the functions into an API. That&#x27;s how you get poor APIs. For a well designed API it&#x27;s always the other way around. With enough creativity and forethought put into an API, the implementation flows naturally, and in practice, it&#x27;s exactly the opposite of the table of contents analogy.<p>(Not to mention that a ToC may also be copyrightable.)<p><i>> 2) over time the structure becomes standardized because of the nature of the information it attempts to organize suggests that standard.</i><p>The &quot;nature of information being organized&quot; sounds like &quot;functionality&quot; to me. As before, it is distinct from expression.<p><i>> I&#x27;d be willing to bet that if you put 10 people in separate rooms and asked them to create an API, 80% or more would be so close to one another that if someone studied one, they could find their way in another.</i><p>Consider the corollary of your argument. If you asked those same people to write actual implementations for that same problem. I&#x27;d bet you get the same &quot;80% or more would be so close&quot; results. Do you mean that their resulting code would not be covered by copyright? Consider whatever arguments you apply to defend copyrightability of the implementation, and try to differentiate them from the API case.<p>Unless you provide a detailed spec and enforce some conventions, I&#x27;m willing to bet nobody will have an exact duplicate of another, either for implementation or for API. An API for the same functionality, say for getting the number of absentees, may be labeled getAbsenteeCount() or nAbsentees() or NumNotPresent(). Or even absenteeList().length(). Or a poorly defined API may require something like classSize() - numPresent(). Or a really badly defined API would require iterating over each member of the class and checking the &quot;present&quot; flag. And that is the point: each expression of the same functionality can be unique, and hence a candidate for copyright.",1399724462

Existing code is immutable, but new code may always be generated if different behaviour is desired.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure if I could accurately say Julia allows one to trade between efficiency and dynamism when each is desired, but it does appear to be a much better balanced approach than is normal.",1399723372

They are committing crimes, and pleading or being found guilty.<p>The US is locking up very, very large numbers of young black men for minor crimes that people of other races regularly commit -- i.e., for activities that are only crimes when blacks are found to be doing them. Recent studies have shown that whites use more drugs than blacks, and yet are charged far less. Even the sentencing on perceived &quot;black drugs&quot; (drugs more readily available to the poor) such as crack is far more punitive than sentencing for the equivalent cocaine.<p>For a good book on the subject, see The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander.

9576728,comment,9573902,9573902,0,0,jcadam,,,"I was an Ada programmer for about 4 years in the aerospace industry.<p>I remember my last Ada project.  It was run as a traditional &#x27;waterfall&#x27; project (In the early 2010s).  I sat in my hole (cubicle, in the very center of a massive cube farm) coding away on a simulation model for a satellite&#x27;s attitude control system, while the other devs worked on their own modules in silence and isolation.  Integration and testing was pushed all the way to the end of the project.<p>I was a scumbag contractor, hence I was not allowed to see the complete code base like the regular employees were, so I couldn&#x27;t, say, do a complete build to verify my stuff worked (because some of the libraries I needed to build my module I wasn&#x27;t allowed access to).  So I was armed with the Ada compiler as one of my only tools (I just had to ignore the link errors.  Though, I <i>was</i> able to code up a few tests for some of the algorithms I was able to isolate, even though unit testing was neither expected nor encouraged, as it did nothing to increase my SLOC numbers -- i.e., &quot;wasting time&quot;).<p>I worked slowly and deliberately (getting constant flak for my SLOC numbers not going up fast enough -- and apparently if you ever reduce your SLOC, you&#x27;ve made <i>negative</i> progress), and at the end when I passed my code off to the &#x27;build master&#x27; to my amazement my module built and largely <i>just worked</i>.  I have to give credit to the language -- it caught a <i></i>ton<i></i> of stuff at compile time.<p>Suddenly I was no longer a slacker (Gee, thanks).  At the end of that project I left and  never touched Ada again.  I now (probably unfairly) associate Ada with old-school waterfall-driven software development and dank, dark offices with flickering, soul-sucking fluorescent lights.",1432133859

It&#x27;s too complex, too messy, and too &quot;Microsofty&quot; for lack of a better word. Many layers of abstraction, hidden magic in XML files (which you can of course turn off, but then you need to know how to), and so on. Nevertheless, shares of coders blindly use WCF, &quot;because Microsoft tells us to&quot;. Bullshit, and what a waste.<p>There are very few modern use cases where WCF is the best option out there. If you want to make a RESTful API with .NET, please consider:<p><pre><code>     * ASP.NET MVC Web API\n     * ServiceStack\n     * Nancy\n</code></pre>\nNancy is basically Ruby&#x27;s Sinatra but then on .NET.<p>ServiceStack recently became commercial, but it still is the best designed API library I&#x27;ve ever seen, <i>in any language</i>. It makes you focus more on the <i>actual data</i> inside each request and response, and less on the form of that data (is it a query parameter, JSON POST field, or part of a fancy URL? who cares, design your messages first and then figure out what the URLs should look like). The result of this is that somehow you tend to automatically design forward-compatible, extensible API endpoints. I guess you really have to feel it to believe it, but I kid you not, with ServiceStack, it feels like your API designs itself in front of your eyes.<p>If anyone knows anything like ServiceStack on any other language, please tell me and I&#x27;m going to give you hugs.<p>Finally, MVC Web API is basically Rails&#x27;s API controllers ported to C#. It has a tad too much magic for my taste, but it&#x27;s a familiar and decent pattern that just works.<p>Please, please, let&#x27;s just bury WCF and embrace the true goodies in the .NET open source ecosystem. It&#x27;s nice that WCF got open sourced, but it&#x27;s still a mess. If you really must go the &quot;because Microsoft!&quot; route, please just use ASP.NET MVC (also open source, and in active development).",1432133639

The misstep you are taking is assuming that testosterone <i>causes</i> crime, rather than <i>correlates</i> with it. Even this article [1], which you will probably salivate over, doesn&#x27;t suggest that testosterone <i>causes</i> crime, merely that it correlates with misbehavior (in a very particular setting, namely prison). Here&#x27;s [2] research that suggests that socioeconomic status mitigates the correlation between testosterone and misbehavior. At a minimum, this suggests that we have a chicken-egg dilemma between testosterone and misbehavior. The next question I would ask is: Do troubled settings and poor childhoods engender higher testosterone levels in adulthood?<p>Lastly, above and beyond any correlation between testosterone and crime, how do you propose to use this information to inform policy decisions? My main gripe in this fantasyland of HBD-speak is that people use this information as &quot;scientific&quot; grounds for enforcing their racist policy predispositions. I&#x27;d like to hear where you think you would take this testosterone point, but all too often people (and unfortunately, I get the impression that you are one of them) imply that these few studies are grounds for damning and castigating entire populations because of their perceived inferiority and incorrigibility.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/019188699400177T"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/01918869940...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pss.sagepub.com/content/1/3/209.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pss.sagepub.com/content/1/3/209.short</a><p>EDIT for posterity: I would like to point out that you posted your cousin/uncle link upthread after I posted my GP comment above.

When I first started my current job, I had to convince my boss that we should transition from C# to PyQt (and also the rest of the Python ecosystem, which is awesome because we do commercial scientific computing). Mixing Python and Qt has been great for productivity, as you can imagine. There is also a great Python visualization ecosystem based on PyQt/PySide including pyqtgraph and vispy. Lastly, the documentation is absolutely outstanding, and the community is very active.<p>A project I have been wanting to start is to use Qt as a substrate for a (functional) reactive programming framework in Haskell or Python. The Haskell lib could be based on any current FRP implementation, and the Python lib could be based on RxPY [1].<p>One thing I would change in Qt would be the Model/View system. I try to use a strict Model-View-Presenter approach, but since we have millions of rows in our tables we have to use Qt&#x27;s Models/Views instead of controlling all view behavior ourselves. It would be nice to have performant views easily while using a different API, instead of being forced to use the QAbstractItemModel API.<p>Congrats Qt project, and thanks for the hard work!<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY</a>",1432133459

Everything needs to go through Meteor and it leaves no room for flexibility.  Going with Meteor is an all-in strategy... and anyone who knows strategy ought to know that going all-in is for when you&#x27;re exceedingly confident or exceedingly desperate.<p>I recognize Meteor&#x27;s utility as a rapid prototyping tool.

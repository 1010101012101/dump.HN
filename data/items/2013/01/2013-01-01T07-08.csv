4992147,comment,4989579,4991320,2,0,akg_67,,,"The CMU study is most probably flawed as it looked at hardware replacement records and didn't take into consideration the different usage and threshold for replacement between enterprise and consumer drives. Most enterprise drives are used in enterprise servers and storage systems that monitor drive errors closely using SMART. The threshold for drive errors is much lower with such systems and drives are replaced quickly. My company (storage system vendor) replaces disk even when the SMART alerts impending failure and doesn't wait for actual failure. This will come across in hardware replacement log as more frequent replacement of enterprise disks. The consumer disks are used in consumer systems. The consumers don't proactively replace disks, they wait until disk actually fails. This will show up in hardware replacement log as less frequent replacement of consumer disk.<p>I have actually used 'defective' enterprise disks in consumer systems for years after they were labeled defective by storage system vendors. About a decade ago, I used to buy such defective enterprise disks in bulk at auction from server and storage manufacturers and sold them as refurbished disks to consumers after testing.",1357027106

Disruption during instability (such as the economic condition of our country, political instability due to polarized nearly 50/50 political split of the people) is dangerous. But more importantly, estabilished lobbying powers inherently tend to equalize change unless one or more become significantly stronger and change the balance of power. And if those lobbying powers are not in favor of the change, it won't happen. Finally, change can lead to a great deal of uncertainty. Uncertainty is risk, and risk is typically bad when it comes to politics.<p>Amendments to the constitution could happen of course, but this would be an unlikely time for them.<p>It is more likely that the interpretation of the constitution would change.

I've always felt a strong connection between hacking and magic - both involve trying to ""hack"" a problem in a way that ordinary minds will never think of.<p>In fact, I credit magic with teaching me the roots of skepticism and rationality - once you know how to explain seemingly unexplainable things, you realize that things that you <i>can't</i> explain mean a lack of knowledge on your part, not a lack of explanation on the universe's part.

4992131,comment,4986223,4992025,2,0,chernevik,,,"""Sense of"" clauses often determine the precise allocation of appropriated funds.  Indeed _committee_reports_, which lack the dignity of a full vote of either House, or a Presidential signature, are treated by executive departments as determinative of public spending.  They are the primary mechanism for designating ""pork barrel"" spending and thus are treated as the primary targets of lobbying efforts.<p>I know this because I have worked on those bills.<p>I do not know the legal or regulatory landscape around telecommunications in nearly such detail.  But knowing the importance of such language in a REALLY significant corner, I would be very, very slow to regard any of it as without ""impact [on] public facing policy.""  Not without a very thorough explanation of why exactly it was meaningless, and regarded as such generally throughout the industry.<p>Again, I don't know the industry.  I do know that the making and implementation of law is a very complicated business, where the black and white readings of law do not yield the simple answers one might expect from logical analysis.  And I know that in very important corners of government language like this, and still further from law than this, is effectively determinative of federal policy.  So blanket claims that ""sense of"" language are without any real force are ""demonstrably incorrect"".",1357026576

What part of the country do you live in?<p>My advice: keep learning cool stuff, go to networking events (e.g. meetups, especially related to NLP, machine learning, and Scala) get some job leads there. Cold-emailing your resume rarely gets you anything, especially when you're in a career sand trap. But you have a skillset that, if you're strong in what you've cited, is desirable.<p>You will eventually get a feel for how much investment you need to put into your day job to keep it, and you can use the remainder of your time (which may be 20-35 hours of your work week) to keep current with the skills you want. If you're writing code on company time, be careful and make sure not to use it for any closed-source purpose, because you don't want your employer asserting ownership.<p>You can get out of the sandtrap but you'll have to break the rules to do it.

If people do need it, I'll implement it.<p>Why: I want to quit my job and ""do startup"" but I don't have any good idea. Dating website is (saturated but still) easy to get traction. I also use this as a learning vehicle (Scala, CoffeeScript, AngularJS, Google App Engine).<p>When: I'm doing this after hours and weekends.<p>Where: http://www.ngajakjalan.com<p>How: Most likely you don't want to create an account, so please login with demo/demo. It's a real account, so please don't send message to other members from there :)<p>Stats so far: Landing page for 2 months, then 2 months running. 8k members, 85% male, 100k pageviews/month. Spending $10 daily for FB ads to get female members.<p>Specific questions: I'm thinking of raising seed money so I can quit my job and work on this fulltime. Given my situation (single, employed, solo founder) and my website progress, (1) Is this a good idea? (2) What would it take to get me there? (3) If not good idea, what are the alternatives?",1357024985

After every page load note down what type of item you see in the advert place (of these 3 types):<p>- (a) Goodwill notice (eg: ""thanks for not blocking our adverts"", ""try reddit gold!"", a cutesy flash game)
- (b) reddit community advert (eg: visit our subreddit!)
- (c) proper advert (eg: ""buy starcraft for $40"", ""watch looper on netflix!"")<p>Here are my results:<p>a a a a a a a a a a b a b a a a a a b a a b b a a<p>The goodwill notices are things reddit are displaying themselves, so they generate no revenue. The community adverts are  I <i>think</i> currently free due to some sort of promotion, but when they're not free they're a couple of $ through the self serve platform. The proper adverts are... well, I didn't see a single one!<p>I've just viewed 25 pages and I have not once been monetised. If you view any other website that makes money through advertisements you'll have AT LEAST one or two monetised adverts per page, often more. Here's a website the company I work for runs: <a href=""http://www.minecraftwiki.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minecraftwiki.net</a> every page load has at least 3 adverts. If you visit our website 25 times you've viewed ~75 monetised adverts, if you view reddit.com you see ~0 monetised adverts.<p>The problem reddit has is that the community is against adverts, people love reddit because it's not part of the terrible money making internet, they see it as a warm lovable place they can go and be safe from the big bad advertisers and they know when reddit <i>does</i> have paid-for advertisements they're going to be good quality. This is obviously not a good revenue strategy though.<p>Reddit wouldn't have a problem bringing in revenue if they held themselves to the same standards as the rest of the internet, but they don't, they hold themselves to really really really high standards and have backed themselves into a really shitty corner where they either get money through paid subscriptions, get money through really good quality adverts that users are comfortable with (but are rare) or hope they can scrape by on the single nice advert that <i>might</i> display on one page in every... 100, because that won't upset the users.<p>Personally I think they're going to have to eventually accept that yes, it's really good to be the one final website on the internet that really does care about their users, but it's not a maintainable business strategy and what matters most to users is not that they don't have to see adverts, it's that the website they have invested their time, energy and care into is going to be there tomorrow.<p>I think it's comparable to the instagram situation. instagram considered monetising in a way that upset users; reddit fears they will end up doing exactly the same and it isn't just a fear of the users reactions, it's how they want reddit to be. I think it was about 3 years ago that an advertiser sneaked a rogue advert onto reddit through their ad network (it caused some dumb pop-up thing to display, if I recall correctly) and explaining the reddit reaction as ""vocal reddit users went ape-shit"" would be a gross understatement.<p>Summary: reddit (as a company) holds itself to standards that are way above the rest of the internet, reddit users love this but it's detrimental to the finances of reddit. reddit could throw in the towel tomorrow and become just like the rest of the internet and they would make money. (obviously doing this would potentially alienate users, which is the downside, I don't believe that this would be bad enough for users to actually leave and is not comparable to the digg situation, but generating ill feelings amongst the reddit community even if they don't leave is still <i>bad</i>)",1357023750

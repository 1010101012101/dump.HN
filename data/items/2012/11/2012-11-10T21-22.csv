4767864,comment,4767227,4767706,1,0,revaaron,,,"I think if you're happy with what you're using, stick with it.<p>I switched from pico/emacs/TextMate/Notepad++ to VIM about three years ago. I always hated vi. I love it now, and really wish I would have switched earlier. But the advantages don't become obvious until you make yourself to live with it for a while. The initial learning curve is pretty steep, but once you get over that hump it's pretty easy going.<p>This is very different from emacs, which was very easy for me to do simple tasks but very hard for me to do anything complicated. It's also different from pico, TextMate, and Notepad++, which are easy to pick up but plateau, sometimes leaving to write a script to do what you need.<p>Using a vi-like mode for another editor doesn't really cut it, not unlike an emacs-workalike that isn't built atop a powerful scripting language. For me, it's about the way commands stack and compose rather than using hjkl instead of arrow keys.<p>Good luck and have fun!",1352584774
4767863,comment,4767417,4767806,3,0,spindritf,,,"> Basically, the government forced local loop unbundling, so that the phone companies were required to lease space in their equipment centers to competing ISPs at fair prices and give them access to local loops to offer DSL and other services.<p>Similar idea was implemented in Poland. It mostly means that you can now get the same crappy DSL connection from a number of providers instead of the single (formerly national) telecom. The quality probably did increase a little, and it is fairly affordable but I don't know a single person who's genuinely happy with that sort of Internet access. Most live in suburbs or outright rural areas and have no choice (the other options are flaky mobile, or expensive and high-latency satellite link).<p>Only real competition leads to improved quality. In large cities where you have properly separate providers -- cable companies, local area networks, mobile providers and the large telcos -- actually competing, you can get a decent TV package, phone with a local number, DVR, 10+MBit (and going as high as 120MBit) connection and maybe even mobile Internet dongle thrown in for ~$40.",1352584758

4767851,comment,4766560,4767808,2,0,rayiner,,,"> Meanwhile, you seem to be advocating for fighting draconian or ridiculous intellectual property laws or actions by...letting the market decide? That's not going to work out.<p>I'm against government spending lots of money to help enforce copyright. I was against SOPA because it forces third parties to help protect content providers' property rights. Which is unreasonable. After all, the law doesn't force my neighbors to help protect my property rights. People are responsible for policing their own property rights for the most part.<p>But that's not what is at issue here. Charging per viewer for content is like BMW charging ridiculous amounts for parts and labor for their cars. Who cares? If you buy a BMW you know that being gouged for maintenance is part and parcel of the experience. It's between you and the company you are buying from.<p>I'm not a free market true believer by any means. I think there are lots of problems not solved by the market and we need affirmative measures in those cases. But I suppose with the copyright debate, I just don't agree that there is really a problem. If Disney figures out a way to charge you every time you watch their shitty movies, then great, more power to them. It's a great business model to sell something that is physically totally fungible, but which consumers perceive as non-fungible (LV bags, BMW cars, etc). The fact that consumers eat it up anyway doesn't strike me as a problem worth solving.",1352584507

4767848,comment,4767227,4767740,3,0,jseliger,,,">TextMate seemed really awesome, as did BBEdit, so why not stick to what you know?<p>I think the problem with Textmate is that it appears to effectively be abandon-ware. I and many others are skeptical that a final, complete version of 2.0 will ever be released, and the source-code dump makes it seem even less likely. Second-system syndrome is alive and well.<p>In general, it's not a good idea to continue investing time and effort in software that will eventually cease to be available or updated. Given the persistence of vim and emacs, it seems unlikely that either will be abandoned in any reasonable short- to medium-term timeframe.",1352584462

Turns out it was not. A huge number of ISPs jumped in to compete in the DSL market, and the phone companies found they were making more money as landlords leasing out space for equipment than they had been making from running their own ISP business.<p>On the consumer side of things, there was a big increase in choice, with ISPs jumping in to offer everything from serious power user plans and low latency plans for gamers to cheap plans for people who just use email.<p>Amusingly, AT&T and Verizon from the US both wrote to British regulators when unbundling was under discussion and provided strong arguments in favor of it.

As a result, vau expressions can be used to implement macros, both the hygenic and non-hygenic variety, and the language need not define quoting or quasiquoting because those features can also be implemented within vau expressions.<p>Vau expressions seem to play havoc with static analysis, though, so there are good arguments for actually having some of those things as built-in language features rather than just building everything as a standard library.",1352582556

It scares me to think that intelligent people are just now realizing the consequences of making a highly-demanded product illegal. Really, all drugs should be legalized and controlled. The problem is that we're not only facing religious drones who can't see past the end of their noses, but more importantly, we're up against big money. And big money has power. I'm talking not only the cartels but private prison owners. Do you think those guys want to see their customer(prisoner) numbers decrease? Or what about law enforcement and the drug agency? You think those guys want their funding cut? Because if you remove drug-crime control you remove the majority of their work.

4767736,comment,4766666,4766666,1,0,drewcrawford,,,"As a client-oriented business, I am a proud disciple of the Gospel of Tools.<p>1.  Tools are one of the few institutional advantages that are in the domain of the programmer (rather than the MBA or the sales force).  There are many shops out there that suffer from a lack of technical leadership and compete on the basis of (absolutely incredible!) strength of the sales force.  Software developers don't win at that game.<p>They can, however, win at having the best tools.  You have to have some unfair advantage, and in most developer-run studios, tools are easier to cultivate than sales methodologies.<p>2.  Customer-facing tools provide customer-visible value.  If you're writing error-reporting software that helps debug issues on customer systems, that's providing visible value.  If you have client dashboards that show the status of their project and predict ship dates, that's visible value.  If your network protocol is faster than REST for your vertical, that means faster software, and that's visible value.<p>It's all about giving your customers something to hang their hat on to select your shop.  If they are getting ""good vibes"" from the other sales guys, but your software automatically builds them a Powerpoint deck of the project status to present at the weekly update meeting, then there's some class of customers who will prefer working with you, and you are better insulated from competition.<p>3. If you and your competitors don't do tool investment, then all the boats will rise at the same speed.  But if you are doing tool investment, your boat will rise faster.  At some point you can do the same job and provide better value than anyone else.  When people figure that out, your competitors are forced to first, cut prices to remain competitive, and second, raise expenses to try and achieve tool parity.  But you've already got a long head start, so they will either run out of money, license the tools from you, or just focus on the more sales/MBA-receptive customer base, and shrink to a niche offering.<p>4.  As I've hinted at, tools can be valuable and can be licensed to other shops.  The only way to really get out of the client ""rat race"" is to become a product company.   Tools are an easy way to make that transition; you have a built-in customer base and an intimate knowledge of the problem domain.",1352581504

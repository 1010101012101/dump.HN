6530240,comment,6526484,6529985,5,0,rayiner,,,"Interesting indeed, but not all that relevant to my point.<p>Regarding the first study: it looks at a small wealth shock (bringing people to the median level of wealth at the time), and compares outcomes (occupational status, literacy, education) that were largely irrelevant to the median people of the time. Simply put, why would you expect people winning a median level of wealth in 1832, a time when the median person was a poorly-literate or illiterate, uneducated, farmer, and then expect that the winners would be more educated, more literate, or have an occupation other than farming? Besides all that, it addresses a different point than the one I&#x27;m making. It essentially goes toward showing that poor people, given a windfall of wealth, do not invest it in their childrens&#x27; education. But whether your parents invested in your education or not is not a &quot;chosen behavior&quot; on your part. It&#x27;s an external variable you have no control over. To counter my argument, what you need is a study showing either that rich people don&#x27;t invest more in their children than poor people, or one showing that such investment doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Regarding the second study, I&#x27;m not sure what sort of extrapolations you can draw from a data set that consists purely of people who were already in financial trouble. These people probably have impulse control issues. Is that a &quot;chosen behavior?&quot; It&#x27;s something we can measure in kids that are just a few years old.<p>If you really want to discern the magnitude of the impact of &quot;chosen behavior&quot; you have to factor out the effects of things that aren&#x27;t &quot;chosen behaviors.&quot;<p>The bottom line is that you don&#x27;t choose your parents, and you don&#x27;t choose the things you inherit from them. You don&#x27;t choose your IQ, you don&#x27;t choose the size of your trust fund, you don&#x27;t choose to learn how to behave in professional society from an early age, you don&#x27;t choose many personality factors like attentiveness or impulsiveness, etc. These things are not &quot;chosen behaviors.&quot;",1381441551

6530237,comment,6529905,6530085,9,0,smtddr,,," I&#x27;ll jump into this touchy subject. The reason why there are not efforts to balance the other fields you mention is because of the &quot;position of power&quot;/&quot;social prestige&quot; of said jobs. 
 I don&#x27;t think anyone can debate that due to complicated social/economic issues, but significantly sexism/racism, the history of USA shows that jobs with power/prestige are usually held by white males. Oprah Winfrey crying at Obama&#x27;s speech wouldn&#x27;t of happened if Obama just became the first black garbage man. It was about the power/prestige of a black man being USA president. Sexism pretty much puts women as teachers & nurses and &quot;men&quot;(or society in general) is apparently fine with that. Road maintenance, garbage collection? Those are low-prestige & physical/dirty work. That&#x27;s for minorities & men. Society(sexism) probably prevents most women from even considering those jobs and the few that do, I&#x27;m sure are greeted with an insane amount of inappropriate jokes/comments.
 Now, since positions of power/prestige tend to have a much greater impact on overall society, having some balance in those positions will help make products & laws more diverse to reflect the diverse society we&#x27;re in. BTW, this is why I find it ridiculous the concept of exclusively men making laws on abortion.<p>Anecdotal: When I was a kid, I had to take some kind of &quot;development&quot; test to see if I was generally progressing properly. I failed that test, the results stated things such as &quot;No solid understanding of reality vs fantasy&quot;. My parents were livid. They went to school to complain. Turns out, <i>a lot</i> of parents were complaining. Also turns out, all the  complaining parents were foreigners. And it also turned out that the questions on the test had a heavy assumption that you were an american child with american parents. I didn&#x27;t know what a pizza was when I was a kid; that&#x27;s one of the questions I bombed. My parents never got it for me; at least not yet. The school ended up having to put the test-questions through some kind of minority/foreign-parents verification process and re-do the tests for everyone.",1381441545

I&#x27;m surprised by the dislike of Actionscript (guess it&#x27;s memories of AS2 mostly). AS3 is quite nice in my opinion, and the display list is a charm to work with, while FlashDevelop is one of the nicer IDEs that I&#x27;ve had experience with. Sure, it runs on Flash and the timeline concept is weird when not making animations, but that should have no bearing on the language itself (and it seems there are efforts towards alternative runtimes anyway, who knows where this may go in the future).
I&#x27;m surprised by how many people like Go, because, while nice, seems not very relevant and a bit directionless imo. Also surprised by the overwhelming popularity of Python compared to Ruby, which I think is better than Python in every way (except performance, but both are the wrong tool for such a job in my opinion).
I don&#x27;t see why there is a &quot;Lisp&quot; here, as it seems to have both Scheme and Clojure, but (weirdly) not Common Lisp.
Rust shouldn&#x27;t be here either, as it&#x27;s a WIP. Judging a language that&#x27;s still in alpha seems... wrong.",1381439113

6530008,comment,6528833,6529835,1,0,GVIrish,,,"Where lack of accountability comes is the idea that contractors can be fired if they don&#x27;t do a good job, whereas it is much more difficult to fire a full-time employee.  So rather than solving that problem, most of the government&#x27;s software development is farmed out to contractors.  The other reasoning for contractors is that contractors don&#x27;t get retirement benefits that FTE&#x27;s do, so in theory that saves the govt money but in practice it probably doesn&#x27;t, given that contractor bill rates are usually 200-300% or in excess of what FTE salaries are.<p>Not to say that FTE&#x27;s are great or anything, contractors do tend to me more up-to-date on technology but I think that is a result of the government employee hiring practices and compensation scale.<p>Yeah I&#x27;ve seen a lot of &quot;business line owner&quot; issues like the ones you&#x27;ve mentioned.  Another common one is that software is often built to mirror dysfunctional and wasteful business processes.

If you scroll to the left you can accidentally do a page-back and leave the app. Setting a beforeunload handler actually makes the problem worse because the confirmation dialog doesn't appear until the page has completely disappeared, and if you choose to stay on the page, Safari just shows a blank page instead of redisplaying the app.<p>I don't quite understand the by-default conflation of two actions (scrolling and paging) using two fingers. It's all very well that I can myself change to three finger swipes for paging, but I can hardly instruct all Lion/Safari users to change their system settings.

Many great companies had ideas that were quickly dismissed by these ""VERY smart VCs and entrepreneurs"".""<p>It's not for the money. It's for the experience that you get, the day to day conversation with all the teams, the contacts that you can get, the incredible feedback and criticism from highly experienced mentor AND the money (Which is really not that much, but just enough to get started and focus without stressing about how you will eat). And note here, I'm talking about <i>first time entrepreneurs</i>; Not someone who's got 5 startups already sold or a google/facebook/whatever CTO.<p>And yeah, you can argue that you don't <i>need it</i> and sometime startups were wrongly dismissed by good VCs; but it's rare. It's their job to spot great startups/revolutionary ideas/extraordinary teams.<p>The fact that you are not chosen means something. You can't only dismiss it.. It's important to know why you weren't chosen. And ""The teams were awesome this year"" is not a reason. I mean, if your idea is awesome and you are great but they didn't accept you, there must be a reason. Is it because they didn't ""get"" it? Or felt that the market wasn't ready for it? Or that even though you <i>think</i> you're awesome, you're not?<p>""Of course, there's also the argument that the 4-5 YC partners just can't take on every potentially successful startup.

If you were refused because of your grades, it's perfectly understandable. If it's because you can't speak the language of the university, it's understandable. But if you're among the best with a great personality and awesome grades, why would they refuse you?<p>And then, school is really different in the way they accept you. It's more about your dossier and your grade.. not about your potential. Whereas, with an incubator, they don't care about your past, they look at you. Your idea. Your personality. Your enthusiast. The fact that they refuse you means a lot more; PG really looked at you, talked with you and thought: ""No. You're not in.""",1311363651

Since OSX has a fairly decent marketshare at this point, it's an easier argument to make a native port over multiplatform, portable code like Java.<p>One of the issues with Java on OSX was that, most of the time, you couldn't actually code to the latest version of Java, because Apple was months(or even years) behind on implementing new JVM and Java language specs.<p>It took Apple about a year and a half to update their JVM to 1.6 after that was released.

I ended up quitting the addiction because I needed to get some real work done. One thing about DF: there is never a lack of things to do with your world. In my last game I built an engraved obsidian cast tower. In Dwarf Fortress terms this means I built a powered pump system to extract magma from the earth and water from a nearby river and used the water and magma to cast obsidian for a stone tower which I then hollowed out with rooms and storage areas as a dwelling place for my dwarves. Around the tower I built a magma moat for defense from the marauding goblins and zombies. The fortress has survived more than 15 years of attacks so far. I just don't open it up for fear of getting hooked on DF again. ;)",1311362278

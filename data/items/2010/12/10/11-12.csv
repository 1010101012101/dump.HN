1991377,comment,1991234,1991234,0,0,jrockway,,,"Can't you just implement finally in ""userspace""?  In Perl, you can implement it with object destruction -- you make an instance of an object whose destructor does the cleanup you want, and when it goes out of scope (exception thrown, return, etc.), the cleanup code is run.<p>It's extremely common to write code like:<p><pre><code>    sub work_in_tmpdir(&) {\n        my $cwd = cwd;\n        my $guard = guard { chdir $cwd };\n        chdir mktmp;\n        $_[0]->();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThen you can safely work in a temporary directory:<p><pre><code>    print cwd; # /home/jon\n    work_in_tmpdir { print cwd; die ""OH NOES"" }; # /tmp/3sdjkh387dh\n    print cwd; # /home/jon\n</code></pre>\nIf this doesn't look enough like Java, that's easy to fix:<p><pre><code>    sub try(&;@) {\n        my ($code, %args) = @_;\n        my $guard;\n        $guard = guard { $args{finally}->() }\n            if exists $args{finally};  \n        my $result = eval { $code->() };\n        if($args{catch} && !$result){\n            $args{catch}->($@);\n        }\n        return $result;\n    }\n    catch(&;@) {\n        return catch => @_;\n    }\n    finally(&) {\n        return finally => $_[0];\n    }\n</code></pre>\n(+) Now you can say:<p><pre><code>    try     { something_exceptional }\n    catch   { warn ""Something bad happened: $_[0] }\n    finally { cleanup };\n</code></pre>\nNo language feature or bug tracker rant-fest required!  And, I'm pretty sure that you can abuse destructors in PHP to get exactly the same result.  (In Perl, that ""guard"" function from the Guard module is implemented something like:   class Foo { has 'cleanup' => (is => 'ro', isa => CodeRef ); sub DESTROY {  $self->cleanup->() } }; sub guard(&){ return Foo->new( cleanup => $_[0] ) })<p>(+) Also, don't cut-n-paste this code into your apps.  It misses special cases.  use Try::Tiny, TryCatch, etc. from the CPAN.",1291982398

This sends a clear message which forces other people / companies to reassess their values (i.e. what's more important for your neighbor: you or your parking spot)<p>If Oracle were to lose customers on this, I'd bet they would think twice before ditching ASF / Harmony.<p>b) for people / companies that cannot be trusted, deals are sealed with contracts that are legally binding.<p>In the case of SUN/Oracle: Apache warned everyone about the inability to implement a third-party open-source Java and OpenJDK was just a distraction from the real issue, which shows just how gullible we are (yeah, software developers never read the fineprint).<p>In the case of C#/.NET ... at least the language, the core library and the CLR are real ECMA / ISO standards, there's also a patents grant that doesn't prevent supersets, and there is no TCK or fields-of-use restrictions to speak of.<p>Some people say that these standards do not include important pieces of infrastructure like ASP.NET, WPF or Windows Forms: I say that's a feature, because you wouldn't want to carry that bloat to whatever platform you're targeting (like mobile phones).

I don't know why this one is so compelling for some programmers, but it is extremely popular. If there's a rocket in the game, rest assured that there is a ""Rocket"" class (Assuming the code is C++) which contains data for exactly one rocket and does rockety stuff. With no regard at all for what data tranformation is really being done, or for the layout of the data. Or for that matter, without the basic understanding that where there's one thing, there's probably more than one.<p>Though there are a lot of performance penalties for this kind of design, the most significant one is that it doesn't scale. At all. One hundred rockets costs one hundred times as much as one rocket. And it's extremely likely it costs even more than that! Even to a non-programmer, that shouldn't make any sense. Economy of scale. If you have more of something, it should get cheaper, not more expensive. And the way to do that is to design the data properly and group things by similar transformations.</i><p>It's from this blog post called ""3 Big Lies"": <a href=""http://cellperformance.beyond3d.com/articles/2008/03/three-big-lies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cellperformance.beyond3d.com/articles/2008/03/three-b...</a><p>When I read it I thought: ""That's a pretty common understanding isn't it?

I'm based out of India, and a lot of companies here are quite traditional - upto an extent that they block facebook and gmail in the office.<p>I have listed a set of things which are out of context, but then I want to ensure that I want to get hired by somebody who actually understands the importance of IRC, Joel's views, etc. How to win friends and influence people = people skills, which I think connects with other aspects like Peopleware, Developer happiness and motivation, etc.<p>Finally, having an objective insight from another perspective is very helpful, and thanks for doing so! All the inputs that I'm getting are being taken into consideration and will help me further refine the CV.<p>Cheers!",1291979657

1991290,comment,1990087,1990221,0,0,relic17,,,"It is one thing to express an opinion in a peaceful manner, and a completely different thing to threaten and physically attack people.  Intellectual battles are fought by persuasion, not physical force.  Disagreeing with a government action that does not threaten you physically is not a justification for hurting people and destroying their property.<p>The above is the main premise in this discussion.  Next comes the entitlement argument.  The UK government is not introducing a new policy, rather it is scaling back on an old one, restricting its involvement in education.  It is sensible to bring back more freedom in education, where prices, just like in every other market within a free uncontrolled economy, should reflect fundamental value.<p>Obviously, the government has to be careful not to withdraw its support too quickly.  After all, its involvement has distorted incentives in education to such an extent that withdrawing substantial funds too fast can cause a  major economic upheaval.  From what I know about the issue, this is not the case.  I hope this is a gradual change in the right direction.<p>The best the students can do is re-evaluate their moral and philosophical stance on the issue and if they still believe that someone else should pay for their education, rather than their parents or themselves, they should try to persuade the government by peaceful means.  But obviously, I question the ""ethics"" of forcibly taking away someone else's income to provide for cheap education.  Some student leaders in the UK claim that it is only fair that the super-rich pay for their (the students') education.  It is ok, if such rich people want to donate to universities and sponsor students voluntarily, but it is unethical to force them to pay (as some students want, although the majority are indifferent about the outside source, as long as the money is provided).  To me, a person who advocates the violation of someone else's rights cannot claim that he/she is protecting his/her own ""rights"" from a moral standpoint.",1291979187

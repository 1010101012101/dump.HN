Without the bottleneck of seek time, latency should be much easier to quantify. Also, since you wouldn't be penalized for ""context switching"" (I know this term doesn't really apply to disk IO, but I mean switching disk jobs often, which requires a head move on HDs) you could maybe someday slice up the SSD time like a CPU and guarantee it directly. (For instance, if the SSD is capable of 200mbps, you're slice could be guaranteed 10mbps. Or something more technically realistic, I am but an amateur.)",1242745005

616863,comment,616676,616676,0,0,KirinDave,,,"So Apple's perceived value dropped and ""Microsoft's"" perceived value rose?<p>There are two variables that need to be controlled for here:<p>1. Apple hasn't made any major product announcements this year. Apple is a company that lives and dies by its carefully controlled press releases and a sense of ""newness"" and ""cutting edgeness"".<p>2. There's no indication that the MS ads in question actually caused this shift. If they're talking to canny consumers, this switch could be around the perception of netbook sales alone. Those are skyrocketing, and a perfectly usable and incredibly portable machine for under $400 (after tax) <i>is</i> a great value.<p>Still, take this with a grain of salt. People love to provide reports that Apple is suddenly failing or did not deliver on sales promises, with all kinds of conjured ""data"" to back it up. In the end, Apple has consistently delivered or exceeded on their projections and they've held up their sales significantly better than everyone else in the market during the economic downturn.",1242744392

Windows Vista sucked before it was released, it sucked when it was released, and it still sucks at the point when Microsoft is trying to bury it. Macs offer a very different user experience from Windows, and it's like saying a Chevy is better than a BMW because it's cheaper.

I suspect they come from people who have never used a modern Mac regularly.<p>I have a recent Macbook pro sitting in front of me. Granted, you could match it feature-for-feature and probably save a bit of money (not as much as you think, though), but, there's one feature you wouldn't get with any alternative: build quality.<p>This lovely piece of kit is far and away the best laptop I've ever owned, from a hardware point of view. Not only is it sleek and elegant, but it feels really good and solid (thanks to the single-piece shell). The trackpad is second to none. The keyboard is brilliant. The suspend/resume is flawless. Everything is basically perfect about it (ok, except for the glossy screen).<p>You can't get that by cobbling together hardware like most other laptop manufacturers seem to. And for a piece of kit that I sit in front of for about 14 hours a day, it's nice to have something that's so <i>finished</i>. No dell or HP or Acer or whatever ever did that for me.<p>So, no, you can't get the same hardware for cheaper. Because the way the hardware is put together <i>is part of the hardware</i>.",1242744318

616854,comment,616542,616670,0,0,brk,,,"I don't think that anyone has denied that they are able to monetize users in some fashion.  What is hotly debated though is whether or not they can monetize users sufficiently enough to make those users profitable in the short and/or long term.<p>Facebook's overhead certainly appears to be quite substantial.  They are literally building new datacenters and are running a ton of equipment.  Even if you could theoretically fire all the sales, marketing and HR types, you'd still be left with a pretty big bill at the end of each month.<p>Various online sources say that Facebook has a little over 1,000 employees.  Let's say the average employee is $80K fully loaded.  That's $80M/year just in payroll.  You haven't even talked about real-estate to sit those employees in, PCs for them to work on, or the servers and infrastructure to run the company.<p>Also, much of that revenue (for all practical purposes, maybe all of it) seems to be advertising related.  There is a lot of talk about the declining values of online advertising, and no one seems to have cracked the system on how to do that advertising in a fully effective manner.  So, Facebooks revenue is coming from a source that they don't have a strong ability to manage and control (vs., say, user subscription fees).",1242744099

A lot of people watch the Super Bowl as much for the ads as the sporting event. Given the high budget for ads and the current trend of ""funny"" or ""ironic"" ads, it's neither surprising nor shameful that people like them.<p>The ""ooh new Apple ads"" could be in part because the ads have two excellent comedian/actors who help do the writing, and because most people find the current stance that Microsoft takes against Apple to be somewhat comical.

Only then would there be some real pressure to figure out how to make some money model work in the face of ""free"". The industry makes noises about how necessary they are, but ""we"" as a whole clearly don't believe them, and the only way they can prove they are right is to stop.<p>Of course, the music industry is stuck, in that it's very easy to make and distribute music. It's a common hobby, and has been for decades, and just gets cheaper and cheaper.<p>Maybe the movie industry could pull this off; while movies will continue to get easier and easier, I doubt a ""summer blockbuster"" will ever get as easy as music is now, if for no other reason than the fact that a five minute song is adequate but a ""full"" movie is an hour and a half, and each minute is intrinsically harder.<p>What if there isn't actually any way to monetize these industries? Should anything be done about that? What should, and what <i>could</i>, be done?

Sorry if we've ever given off a different impression. What you may be referring to is that we're primarily focused on time-based subscriptions for now, vs. usage based subscriptions - that much is true. That said, very soon you'll be able to pile usage charges on top of any time-based subscription, which covers what a lot of businesses need in terms of usage fees.<p>Still not clear? Probably my fault! Hit me up at support@spreedly.com anytime and I'll gladly clarify.",1242742605

They seem like they could make some aspects of OOP in a dynamically-typed language much easier.<p>Maybe I'm reading you wrong, but it sounds like you think this is a set of  changes to python. It's not, it's a different language with some syntax inspired by python.<p>Either way, I don't think their goal is to overtake python - besides, the language is still really young.",1242742563

After spending weeks building a billing system for a client and not being at all pleased with the result (bad API, insufficient budget, etc.) I knew there had to be a better way. Billing is the red-headed stepchild of an application, never getting as much time as it needs and simultaneously taking up more time than it should - indicators that point towards outsourcing it ASAP. I think Spreedly's the best option, but even if you don't go with us, please don't do it yourself!",1242742151

Search engines do not (generally) charge a direct price, but they do implicitly charge a price in the form of ads on the page.  If Google decides to blanket their search results with many more ads than they currently do, I have no problem switching to a competitor.  Lots of other people will switch too.<p>There are conceivably other ways that Google could indirectly raise prices on consumers, but realistically it is a huge waste of money to prosecute a company that gives stuff out for free.  Furthermore, threatening such action poisons the business environment by making investment more risky.  It is a terrible idea.",1242741942

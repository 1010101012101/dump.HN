9859992,comment,9857288,9859810,0,0,mountaineer,,,"Sure, it&#x27;s possible/reasonable to do both. I work with asynchronous Microservices using RabbitMQ where PubSub shines in that many services can respond when the application publishes a message (1 service for email, 1 for push notifications, 1 for capturing data for analytics, etc). But it is fire and forget as far as the application is concerned.<p>Compare that to synchronous services where the application has be aware of all of them and coordinate calling them all. It is easier to use synchronous when the application requires an output from the service to respond.<p>Transactions across services are certainly not easy:<p>&quot;Distributed transactions are notoriously difficult to implement and and as a consequence microservice architectures emphasize transactionless coordination between services, with explicit recognition that consistency may only be eventual consistency and problems are dealt with by compensating operations.&quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html</a>",1436468383

Connections need to be long standing - otherwise the overhead of creating a new connection is pretty high.<p>Question here - what is a good way to make this long standing connection happen?

Most of the transistors on a chip are actually used for caching or RAM, and in those cases the chips have built in methods for disabling the portions of memory that are non-functional. I don&#x27;t recall any instances of CPUs/firmware doing this dynamically, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there are. A lot of chips have some self diagnostics.<p>Most ASICs also have extra transistors sprinkled around so they can bypass and fix errors in the manufacturing process. Making chips is like printing money where some percentage of your money is defective. It pays to try and fix them after printing.<p>Also, as someone who has ordered lots of parts there are many cases where you put a part into production and then find an abnormally high failure rate.

9859853,comment,9859368,9859368,0,0,Someone1234,,,"The &quot;mess&quot; is highly overstated because multiple different issues are being conflated:<p>- Lack of mod tools/mod support: A real issue. They can solve this by drastically increasing communications, and working much harder on mod tooling over the next six or more months. They&#x27;ve got off to a good start on communication, but tooling will require more time (and consistent improvement).<p>- IAMAs: Reddit has &quot;jumped the shark&quot; by committing NOT to go down the paid AMA route. That&#x27;s a good start. But still no explanation for why they fired their AMA coordinator out of the blue with no backup plan or strategy. The IAMA mod team have, last I read, rejected Reddit Inc.&#x27;s replacement for their AMA coordinator, so I don&#x27;t know how this will wind up getting sorted out.<p>- Harassing sub ban: Long overdue, welcomed by many, complained about constantly by a vocal minority. These subs existed primarily to harass individuals, and they did daily. YouTubers, people with a public Facebook profile, Twitter users, other Redditors, and even random members of the public. They were also invading other subs regularly causing all types of drama. If all of the die hard users actually left for Voat then Reddit would be a better place. Nothing of value was lost. Also Reddit has banned controversial subs before (Fappening, Jailbait, etc) and the sky didn&#x27;t fall.<p>- Ellen Pao: Unfortunately Pao has become a controversial figure within Reddit&#x27;s community. This was because stories about her kept getting removed from the default subs (namely about her failed sexism lawsuit and her husband&#x27;s criminal activities). People blamed her for the removals and claimed it was a cover up, and that only made the whole thing worse. In the medium to long term I don&#x27;t know if she can turn people&#x27;s opinions about her around, but if she can it is going to be an uphill struggle. There&#x27;s also the cancer story which I doubt she&#x27;ll ever be able to get away from (she fired an employee with cancer). Ultimately her time at Reddit might be limited, too much damage to undo now even if some of it wasn&#x27;t directly her fault, she let the perception remain too long and now it is Reddit &quot;fact.&quot;",1436467178

This is my last attempt, because I&#x27;m tired and this is pretty simple logic.<p>If a individual does not successfully reproduce because of an individual trait, then that individual was selected against for not being fit. This is true no matter what the trait. As soon as an individual successfully reproduces, then that individual was <i>not</i> select against. This is a binary proposition: selected-against ⊕ ¬selected-against.<p>Now if some other individual happens to be capable of reproducing more, then that individual&#x27;s traits will be proportionately better represented in the next generation. Over time, these different traits will spread throughout a population and become part of its natural variation.<p>HERE&#x27;S THE IMPORTANT PART: BUT they will <i>both</i> continue to exist within the population because there is <i>no such thing</i> as selecting <i>for</i> a trait. More successful traits will carry a higher proportion within the equilibrium than less successful traits, but all traits not selected <i>against</i> will exist in the population.<p>It&#x27;s important to realize that this is a GOOD THING. If individuals were selected <i>for</i>, reductio ad absurdum, only the &quot;best&quot; individuals would survive.

Originally, this meant we had 5-6 database schemas named <something>_friend, <something>_invite, <something>_news, etc., all one one database.<p>What ended up happening was some services rapidly outgrew the capacity of a single database server, such as our &#x27;news&#x27; service, which handles chat services, private messages, and so on (and thus grows nonlinearly with community growth), unlike other services which grow linearly (like our &#x27;identity&#x27; service).

The niche my product is in currently is in the same place as microcomputers were before the Apple I, with lots of hobbyists making their own setups.<p>I have a friend who built and sold a solar company with contacts in San Francisco he could introduce me to.<p>The product is disruptive and the market is huge/sexy. I have no doubt I could raise from proper angels, however my bias it to maintain as much ownership/control as possible.<p>Thoughts?<p>Sorry for being secretive, but I think its best to stay in stealth mode for now.",1436464871

Even Microsoft Azure has an API management offering since two years.<p>Nowadays all those API gateway features are commodities and doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay for it anymore.

9859588,comment,9856151,9856151,0,0,akeefer,,,"This post kind of misses the main point of services like Wealthfront.  You&#x27;re paying 0.25% in exchange for automatic rebalancing, asset class diversification, and tax optimization.  If the combination of those factors is going to increase your yearly return by 0.25% or more (say, from 6.8% to 7.2%), it&#x27;s worth it.  If they won&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not.<p>It&#x27;s silly to focus entirely on the fee aspect:  the point of using Wealthfront is not because it&#x27;s lower-cost, it&#x27;s because you expect it to be better-performing from a total-return perspective.  They may oversell themselves, and that&#x27;s a valid criticism, but the OP fails to really analyze the raison d&#x27;etre of Wealthfront as a service.  Comparing it to a single Vanguard ETF is not a proper comparison.<p>The Vanguard target retirement fund for 2035, for example, includes four underlying ETFs (US stock, international stock, US bonds, international bonds), whereas Wealthfront portfolios typically have more like six or seven asset classes (differentiating between developed and emerging international markets, and adding in natural resources and real estate).  Left to my own devices, I don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to do the research necessary to do that sort of additional asset diversification myself, determining the ideal allocation and then avoiding too much drift while not incurring too much tax.  I also don&#x27;t have the time to deal with tax loss harvesting, which might not matter for retirement accounts, but does make a difference for taxable accounts:  you&#x27;re likely incurring some taxation issues when it comes to portfolio rebalances, for example, since that necessarily involves asset sales.  If you have $100k in wealthfront, you&#x27;re paying $250/year in fees.  If tax loss harvesting can only harvest $1k in losses during the year that offset (or at least avoid) $1k in capital gains, that still pays for the wealthfront fees by itself (if you assume 15% federal and 10% CA state tax on long-term capital gains).  So, sure, the fees you pay wealthfront compound over time, but so does the money you pay in taxes.  (You do eventually pay the taxes on that gain, of course, but the money you save now compounds over time, so you still come out significantly ahead).<p>So the question is:  does additional asset class diversification plus tax optimization yield at least a 0.25% increase in your total return (net of taxes and fees) in an average year?  I believe it does in my case, hence why I have my money with them.  It&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m some idiot taken in by slick marketing who can&#x27;t do math and doesn&#x27;t know about Vanguard ETFs:  Wealthfront&#x27;s core market is really people who <i>can</i> do math and understand what they&#x27;re getting for their 0.25%.<p>Similarly, you can quibble over asset-based fees over fixed fees, but that also misses the point:  as long as they make me more money than I pay them, I come out ahead.  If I come out ahead, why would I be complaining?  If I don&#x27;t come out ahead, then there&#x27;s still no point in complaining:  just don&#x27;t use the service.  Capitalism at its finest.<p>Again, it&#x27;s sad that the OP and most of the comments in this thread don&#x27;t even attempt to tackle the real value proposition here.  Just saying &quot;Stick it in a Vanguard ETF and you&#x27;ll pay less in fees&quot; is not at all addressing whether or not the core value proposition is valid.",1436464804

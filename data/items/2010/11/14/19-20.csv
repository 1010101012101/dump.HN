The political reality is that people scream bloody murder when even the ""small ticket items"" are changed. There is no possible way the people and the politicians they elect will face and solve this budget crisis in time to avert a crisis. The NYT ""game"" should have had one check box at the bottom labeled ""continue to borrow until the dollar is destroyed"". But people dismiss this danger as just abstract theory and rationalize it on the Russian Roulette Principle (we got away with it in the past).<p>As an aside, there are all sorts of unidentified or implicit errors and bad theories built into this game which makes it a pointless exercise and impossible to actually judge.  For example, If you reduce the tax break for employer-provided health insurance it shows up as a spending cut but that is actually a tax increase on imputed income.  Another example is that if you cap Medicare growth the economic implication (especially if inflation takes off) is price-fixing or rationing of services.  This is Econ 101 (it won't work) but the average person probably does not have the analytic skills to see the cap for what it is.",1289763602
1903947,comment,1903088,1903878,0,0,jeromec,,,"We're experiencing some missed communication. I believe that's because ""how it should look"" encompasses two separate aspects -- functionality, and visual appeal. My comment about helping aesthetics was specifically regarding border width. I don't think you're suggesting a border width decision has anything to do with how something works.<p>Let me explain it better this way. I am fantastic at putting together wireframes for sites. A wireframe requires no programming or artistic ability, because it uses simply black and white lines, yet still effectively communicates the placement of elements, site flow, and overall intended functional user experience. I believe this is the type of design you're referring to. Again, this is something I feel I'm quite good at. Now, while I'm fully capable of cutting up and building out any wireframes I (or anyone else) come up with, and putting them online, it's probably not a good idea, because black and white lines would lack <i>visual appeal</i>. That's where graphic artists (what I usually call graphic designers) come in -- but in that instance they're mostly just adding in shapes, colors, and gradients etc. (and figuring out border width ;)<p>To me, building great wireframes and flow charts generally fits better with the thinking of programmers -- people most in tuned with thinking logically -- than creative artsy types, but that's just my thinking.",1289763550

1903943,comment,1902892,1903721,0,0,qjz,,,"I'm the parent of ""gifted"" children, and found that the tests these days are pretty objective, focusing on identifying traits in order to optimize the curriculum for all students. In spite of different capabilities, kids in an age group are emotional peers, and keeping them together is an important goal. Therefore, it's important not to view the process as stigmatizing or as a popularity contest. Different kids have different needs, and parents who desperately want their children to be labeled as ""gifted"" risk ignoring the true nature of their children, possibly doing more harm than good. I've found it expedient to treat ""giftedness"" as another learning disorder, or at the very least, a special need, which helps to keep my parental ego out of the equation.<p>For example, one of the key traits for identifying the gifted kids is the ability to learn without repetition. They absorb and retain information instantly, and often become bored or restless if they aren't continually challenged. You might be surprised to learn that among the gifted children are often kids with behavioral problems or full-blown ADHD. But it makes sense when you realize that the symptoms can flare up while the teacher is repeating lessons for students who need it, leaving the others to their own devices.<p>Some gifted kids are well-rounded, while others display traits that make them gifted in specific areas (excellent pattern-recognition and large vocabularies can be indicators). A good program will identify these traits and tailor an approach that works best for the individual. It may sound complicated, but I've seen it handled effectively in my children's public school, so it's definitely attainable.",1289763454

But I'll post a few thoughts just so that anyone else in a similar position will be prepared.<p>Everyone pretty much hit the mark with the self-employment tax issue. SE Tax is a 15.3% tax that you have to pay on income earned from a business.<p>It sounds like the etymonline guy pretty much got hosed from paying income tax on the income but failure to pay the SE Tax.<p>Google issues 1099s to anyone that earns over 400 or 600 dollars so the IRS knows if you're making money.<p>But, from the sound of his explanation. His server and upkeep costs should've generated enough expenses to wipe out his income. I'd have to speak with him directly and more in depth but that is the impression he left in his plead.<p>Also, there are ways to avoid paying SE tax entirely. If you incorporate into a S Corp and pay yourself a reasonable income, the rest would be excluded from SE Tax. An Scorp is a passthrough entity which means that all income is not taxed twice like a regular Corp. You pay tax on the income once on your 1040. But because the scorp is still a corporation, then you wouldn't pay SE tax on that income because the distribution is a dividend. You don't pay SE taxes on dividends.<p>Also, it seems like the taxpayer isn't clear about his options once the audit has commenced. Luckily, I'm sure that the taxpayer could still plead his case if he has some facts that could help his situation.<p>But these are my initial thoughts on the situation. I'm going to email him now and see if he's interested in discussing the issue further.<p>I'll update everyone on this issue later on if he is willing to allow me to speak on the matter as a learning experience for everyone.",1289762630

And we know we're able to devote sufficient attention to each one because we can measure it in (a) office hour signups (I have office hours this afternoon and there are still open slots) and (b) how well each batch does after Demo Day (more startups in the summer 2010 batch have raised additional funding than any previous batch).",1289762376

Rather, it's because the middle class has not saved and has instead chosen to accumulate debt. The government, largely chosen by the middle class, has done the same. I don't see how taxing more will help reverse this. On the contrary, it will make the problem worse.<p>Government policy since the founding of the Federal Reserve seems designed to discourage the accumulation of wealth. Government taxes income (i.e., the productive use of time), earnings on savings (capital gains), profits, accumulated wealth directly (by the death tax).<p>In addition, the value of money has been steadily eroded. A century ago, when the federal reserve was founded, an ounce of gold was $20. Now it's about $1400.<p>Besides penalizing the accumulation of wealth, the government encourages it's opposite: debt. Interest is tax-deductible. Government aid for food, housing, education, and medical care is available, as long as you haven't accumulated any wealth. Big (wealthy) businesses are under more regulation than small (mainly poor) businesses.<p>With this kind of government policy, it's no wonder that more people don't accumulate wealth.<p>Accumulated wealth is a good thing. It makes liberty worthwhile and meaningful. It enables innovation. It provides security.

1903865,comment,1903279,1903321,0,0,tibbon,,,"On this concept of feedback loops- do politicians take them into account?<p>Looking at US politics, I strongly feel that members on both side of the aisle look primarily at what is immediately accessible and rarely at long term effects or accountability. Sure, they make drafts, bills laws and propositions that mention things to take effect at some far out date- but that doesn't really mean that they are themselves looking at realistic feedback loops, but rather just what charged issues they can drive against the other side to appease their constituency on their far side.<p>Take DADT, or Same-Sex Marriage. The feedback loop of realistic long-term consequence of them items against other people are likely close to zero. Facts reported in a (leaked) report due to Obama soon seem to point that the effect on the armed forces would be minimal- in my guess probably similar to integrating minorities into the armed forces. The long term effects would be the increased mental health of valued service members, and an increased pool of people that could serve. Yet, R's rally against it, pointing to odd and unfounded rhetoric that is held firmly in just keeping things frozen culturally and socially. They don't look at the long term effects, or even at the fact that some homosexuals might consider voting <i>for</i> them if they backed the bills. It is possible that this isn't the best example, but do politicians really look at feedback loops and probability? No, I don't think so. They look at the feedback onto the next election and that's about it.",1289761762

1903853,comment,1903544,1903544,0,0,daeken,,,"One thing I think this article ignores is that there's a specific tipping point at which it makes sense for a given publisher to drop paper, much like there's one for when they should adopt digital in the first place.  We've seen the latter for most publishers, but we haven't yet seen the former for many at all.  It'll be different for every publisher, with certain things (e.g. tech books) coming earlier than others, but it definitely exists.  It'll be interesting to see where it is for different publishers, and what ends up remaining paper for a long time to come.<p>Another thing I just considered on the same subject: despite that the tipping point is different for each publisher, if half the publishers in the world have killed paper printing, it'll likely accelerate the other half to do the same due to the lack of economies of scale; despite that demand is down, production costs may well increase.  So perhaps there's a more universal tipping point here.",1289761495

The thing is, no amount of experience meeting a payroll helps you understand issues that are critically affected by the way things add up at a macro level. Businesses are open systems; the world economy is a closed system, with feedback effects that are crucial but play no role in ordinary business experience. In particular, an individual businessman, no matter how brilliant, never has to worry about the fact that total income equals total spending, so that if some people spend less, either someone else must spend more, or aggregate income must fall.<p>This is why we have a field called macroeconomics. Unfortunately, the hard-won insights of macroeconomics are being rejected right now in favor of visceral feelings. And we’ll all pay the price.",1289761349

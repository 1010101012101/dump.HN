It's also disturbing that someone relatively popular and important can ""slip away"" in this relatively wide window. I know the quote was: <i>""'When his behavior got more erratic, nobody felt close enough to him to help, and we thought we'd help by protecting his zone of privacy,' she said. 'Respecting that zone of privacy is what allowed him to slip away.'""</i> It's still rather disturbing.",1259211554

Also, it would be interesting to see how much of it is due to speed (passing/cutting off others) and how much is due to the perception of wealth. Most important, are the changes  relevant biologically, i.e. are these changes on the same scale as what you get in other testosterone-raising circumstances? </review>",1259211517
962269,comment,962237,962237,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"There are a few problems that I see here, but two of the big ones:<p>1. As a visitor to a random website, I'm skeptical of reviews I see on that site. If your brand gets big enough that people see ""Comments powered by PlusPanda"" and think ""Oh, ok...I can trust this"", then <i>maybe</i>, but that seems like a pretty lofty goal to have to reach before your business model really clicks.<p>2. The bigger problem is self-selection bias. If I run a great business, of course I'd love more people talking me up on my site. If I run a crappy business, I'll have no reviews or reviews that I can filter, shape, and control. 3rd party review sites remove the power to have and control reviews from the business owner, and that's kind of the whole point.<p>EDIT: I just read this and I realized that I sound really negative. Let me point out that I only bothered to go through the site, think the issue out, and write a comment because I think what you're doing is genuinely interesting and has a lot of potential. I just wanted to point out some issues I'm sure you've thought through, and I'd like to know what your view is.",1259211411

962267,comment,962200,962243,0,0,dasil003,,,"As someone who worked for an agency supplying a few hundred realtors across 6 different MLSes with web development, I can also testify to the <i>utter</i> technical incompetence of at least one of the major suppliers (who shall remain unnamed) of back-ends for hundreds of MLSes.<p>I noticed a bug in our CSV import one day and I discovered that they were quoting, but not escaping quotes <i>in any way</i>.  Thereby making it possible for any realtor to inject whatever the data they wanted for anyone else's listings either before or after theirs (depending on how the data importers resolved conflicts).<p>This was a <i>huge</i> security hole affecting probably hundreds of thousands of listings nationwide, and you know what their developer support said to me?  They actually sent me a suggested workaround tailored to the particular instance of corrupted data that I had encountered.  When I explained to them the ramifications of this to their business they simply ignored me.<p>Damn I'm glad I got out of that game.",1259211351

Nothing comes to mind, but I couldn't 100% promise you that I managed to buy every time.<p>I'm not doubting JGC learned something about that CEO from the fact that the guy didn't buy him coffee, but in America, sometimes not buying coffee just means forgetting to buy coffee.<p>I've always liked the waiter test for salespeople, though: tip a waiter $50 to handle the candidate poorly, and see whether the candidate remains respectful.

Kind of defeats the purpose of open honest reviews and not letting owners delete reviews if users don't know that.<p>With yelp, people know that these are reviews on a third-party site.<p>Also, I'd like to add that since users are embedding these reviews on their own sites', visitors will not know if owners tamper with the reviews with additional javascript.

I think business using this would prefer a higher default rating, rather than have their products get lots of 1s by mistake.<p>It's also not clear in the demo why users have to have to give a name and email to submit a review - do you need that extra friction?",1259210184

There hasn't been a single complete game changer in this space yet, and with the way things are currently progessing I think the solution to the MLS problem will come as a combination of MLSes learning to play nice (we see quite a few distributing their data across multiple sites) and agents and brokers signing up with distribution services, listing their properties on more open sites, or handling their own distribution directly.  We have listing feeds with examples of all of these cases.",1259210140

962243,comment,962200,962200,0,0,mlapeter,,,"As a real estate agent, I agree with the author's point, especially about the technology.  I not only pay hundreds of dollars per year, but technologically they still can't even keep up with basic advancements such as making the mls work in firefox or safari.  The problem, as far as I can tell, is not from individual agents trying to protect their racket, but from our regional and national associations and their somewhat opaque partnerships with private businesses.<p>For example, our national association doesn't even own Realtor.com; they made an apparently permanent agreement with a private company which charges us additional fees for ""enhanced"" listings.<p>The other problem is that the MLS's are all controlled regionally, and it's not so much about the technology as it is about the bureaucracy.  While the author makes an excellent point, many are currently attempting it but it's not easy.  Companies such as Redfin seem to be slowly getting there.  As an agent, I'd be the first to support a free, nationwide MLS, but I don't know if it's something that can be solved by technology alone.",1259209976

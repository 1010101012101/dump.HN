Which is one of the things that I look for when I interview folks or interview at companies.<p>> For me, ...  while working.<p>So I have this opinion that most jobs don&#x27;t require even a C.S. degree or even knowing more about programming than cobbling together a few libraries and getting something out. Now, most companies don&#x27;t agree. You said you learn fast right? This is a lesson you should start learning then. Most companies look for some mythical beast called a &quot;10x&quot; developer. They have no idea how they can solve it. Sure, they can test you on the problems they are working on right now. However, they have no idea what problems they may face in the future. So they test you on a bunch of random &quot;hard shit&quot;. You jump enough hoops, you get hired.<p>/cynic",1385924391

The Parisian &quot;catacombs&quot; were created in preexisting tunnels. And actually weren&#x27;t catacombs at all, because people never wanted to be buried there, it&#x27;s not a necropolis.

So by a royal edict of 1785 the bones in the Innocent Cemetery where moved to an underground ossuary, that became known as the Catacombs of Paris. The Church only did the praying and rituals allowing for the transfer of the dead.<p>But the tunnels where actually the old Parisian quarries..

Google blurs out faces because a) its product is to show streets, not faces and b) because Google realizes <i>not</i> blurring out faces will make the public hostile to them.<p>The key to this is <i>technology</i>. Obviously, good technology is what allows Google to map images to places and to do so at a scale that captures most of the industrialized world. This makes many people uncomfortable as it gives the impression that Google is all-seeing all the time, when the reality is that such images are so time-delayed as to have no surveillance benefit. Yet, there&#x27;s no need for Google to fight this since their product is images of the street, not of random passersby.<p>The less-obvious facet of technology here is that Google has the tech to blur faces <i>en masse</i>. If Google had to blur images out by hand, do you think they&#x27;d do so without specific requests first?<p>Similarly, if there was a technology that existed that insta-blurred everyone&#x27;s faces in a random photo via a master database of opt-ins and advanced facial recognition, it&#x27;s feasible that photographers would be required to use it , in some nations. But as that tech is a long ways off (it&#x27;s not the tech that&#x27;s hard, it&#x27;s that database), the U.S. courts have found it better to let people take photos unhindered rather than chill free speech by leaving open the possibility that you could be sued for taking photos of public activity.<p>To go back to the original topic...you&#x27;re right, I am being fatalistic. But I&#x27;m also being realistic and I&#x27;m also considering the greater framework of laws here. So I throw the question back to you: what is your proposed solution to the problem other than hoping that everyone obeys on the honor system? In my opinion, there is no legislation that could be passed that would not infringe on free speech at large.",1385923085

E.g. a long-distance travel power train module could provide enough juice for driving cross-country (e.g. on holidays), while the commuter power train module would be lighter and less costly to rent. The car could drive itself to a hotspot where such modules are interchanged on demand. This would of course only make sense if there still is something like car ownership - if cars are only rented from central entities, then this entity would just send out specialized vehicles instead.<p>However, I&#x27;m not quite sold that people will give up on car ownership. Yes, there&#x27;s public utilities and public transport, which is not up for individual ownership. But a car in the sense that we have it now is something more personal than a train cabin - a car&#x27;s body is very close to us and we touch it all the time; we leave personal belongings there; and there is something to the fact that this car is always in front of my house/appartment, especially in emergency situations. This last point could be amended with emergency cars which are available to each apartment block, with which driving is just more expensive. Imagine crying &quot;Help!

Here are some things to think about:<p>1. Bitcoin can be attacked in polynomial time.  This is a sharp and very extreme break from the typical expectations we have about cryptosystems, yet Satoshi did not devote any time to this in the Bitcoin paper.<p>2. The security analysis presented in the Bitcoin paper assumes a specific attack strategy, without ruling out others or even mentioning the possibility that another attack strategy could exist.<p>3. The security goal of Bitcoin was never clearly stated in the Bitcoin paper, and there is no clear threat model.<p>4. Almost none of the related work was mentioned, not even to distinguish Bitcoin from that work.  Digital cash has been extensively studied by cryptographers, but that mountain of work was not mentioned at all.  Bitcoin is a multiparty computation system meant to operate on a massive scale, yet at no point did Satoshi mention the even larger body of work that has been published on secure multiparty computation.  Satoshi did not even mention the various ways that distributed systems can be attacked, which are presented in the unmentioned related work.<p>These are not signs that experienced researchers are behind Bitcoin.

None of them are about writing perfect code or non-buggy code.<p>A: I don&#x27;t appreciate insults with a question mark stuck after them.<p>B: While they don&#x27;t tell you <i>how</i> to write non-buggy code many of the points clearly relate to code quality:<p>&quot;1.03. Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it is safe, meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of life, diminish privacy or harm the environment. The ultimate effect of the work should be to the public good.&quot;<p>Safe, meets specifications, passes appropriate tests. In other words, isn&#x27;t buggy. Bugs are just behaviour that doesn&#x27;t meet the spec, software that meets the spec but doesn&#x27;t do what you want is poorly designed - i.e. the spec is wrong. Indeed one can advance a meaningful argument that as long as it meets the spec, software is never fixed, it&#x27;s simply redesigned.<p>&quot;3.01. Strive for high quality, acceptable cost and a reasonable schedule&quot;<p>High quality. What would you call a piece of code with bugs in it? Low quality, one would rationally assume.<p>&quot;3.10. Ensure adequate testing, debugging, and review of software and related documents on which they work.&quot;<p>Adequate testing, debugging. The purpose of tests is to make sure that you meet the spec across the expected input space without producing undesired behaviour - any deviation from this is a bug. Debugging - well, heck - that&#x27;s directly in there.<p>&quot;6.03. Extend software engineering knowledge by appropriate participation in professional organizations, meetings and publications.&quot;<p>Okay, so this one doesn&#x27;t strictly speaking bear on bugs alone. Still writing non-buggy software should be the natural consequence of it and it fits with the theme established in the rest of the document to do with quality of code. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve met any knowledgeable programmers who write buggy code.<p>&quot;6.08. Take responsibility for detecting, correcting, and reporting errors in software and associated documents on which they work.&quot;<p>Errors in software, aka bugs.<p>&quot;7.04. Review the work of others in an objective, candid, and properly-documented way.&quot;<p>As with 6 not solely concerning bugs but doubtless relating to them at least partially.<p>&quot;8.01. Further their knowledge of developments in the analysis, specification, design, development, maintenance and testing of software and related documents, together with the management of the development process.&quot;<p>Maintenance and testing. Okay, that could relate to performance, but one rather <i>hopes</i> you&#x27;re catching any bugs that might be in there too.<p>&quot;8.02. Improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and useful quality software at reasonable cost and within a reasonable time.&quot;<p>Reliable software, i.e. software without bugs. Heck, however poor your software is in terms of efficiency and user interface, if it has no bugs then it&#x27;s at least reliable - it keeps to the contract in the spec.<p>> You can if that&#x27;s part of your process. You do plan things out before you work right?<p>To an extent.

A state of flow is very desirable when doing experimental or exploratory creative work of any kind, not just programming. If you&#x27;re doing something you&#x27;ve never done before but it&#x27;s not too far out of reach, then you can most definitely enter a state of flow. Too far out of reach and anxiety kills the state. Not challenging enough and you don&#x27;t get absorbed enough to enter it in the first place.<p>\u200ECsiksczentmihalyi&#x27;s book identifies eight major components of flow:<p>1. We confront tasks we have a chance of completing;\n2. We must be able to concentrate on what we are doing;\n3. The task has clear goals;\n4. The task provides immediate feedback;\n5. One acts with deep, but effortless involvement, that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life;\n6. One exercises a sense of control over their actions;\n7. Concern for the self disappears, yet, paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over; and\n8. The sense of duration of time is altered.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve <i>ever</i> got into the flow state when just banging out a specific, narrowly scoped piece of code. It&#x27;s just grunt work. It has to be done sure, but for me personally, it doesn&#x27;t provoke the loss of time or complete absorption that experimental or exploratory work does.",1385922194

I&#x27;ve read a lot of Satoshi&#x27;s emails and Satoshi&#x27;s writing style seems at the same time less academically formal but also more technical.  Nick Szabo&#x27;s writing, at least on his blog, seems less technical but more academically formal. Nick Szabo also seems to heavily discuss history and historical concepts. I do not see a lot of technical content on his blog. Satoshi seems to have a greater command of - and focus on - computers. This doesn&#x27;t rule out the possibility the Szabo is some kind of Newton-like polymath who has command of a vast quantity of knowledge, but it seems more likely that Satoshi is more technical-minded than broad-based in his knowledge, despite being very smart.  They might use a lot of the same phrases and idioms but this could just be a function of the fact that Satoshi was heavily influenced by Szabo. Regardless if they are writing about the same topic they are likely to use a LOT of the same words and phrases, and it might be more useful to filter out any words or phrases that are specific to the topic at hand.",1385922051

The language has had an answer for this all along; it was generic &quot;he&quot; that was the interloper, and this was at least partly for ideological reasons—the British parliament even passed a bill in 1850 mandating it!

How is a small team of programmers to know that you will be able to collaborate with them effectively within the space of an interview ?<p>2. What exactly do you mean by &quot;competitive problems&quot; or &quot;puzzles&quot;? What is off-limits?<p>I am asking 2. to identify what you mean by a puzzle. For example, let me take the substring matching problem. There are a ton of ways of doing those which for me traverse the realm of being both puzzles and also in some ways important computer science questions [1]. You could do brute force. You could have a moving hash window and use that to check if the substring is present. (Sort of Rabin Karp). You could build a trie called a suffix tree. Now the way intuition works (at least for me) is that you either know how to solve it, and then you sort of recollect the details in a few minutes. Or you have no idea of how to do it and probably don&#x27;t know how to create a solution like that unless it was super critical that you go figure this out. And the problem is that the real world never throws things straightforward at you. Curveballs at least in the engineering world require transforming previous solutions into something new. So unless you grok trees, how will I know if you really will be able to spot that a random problem is just a tree problem with some modifications and then go ahead and implement it, instead of say spending a few weeks refreshing graphs.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19759/core-algorithms-deployed/19764#19764\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19759/core-algor...</a>",1385921202

I think they meant it to have it read as the number printed, i.e. what you would say aloud when reading if the word billion was not printed.  Of course, one of us could actually register and read (or at least skim) the analyst document :)",1186433838
39891,comment,39699,39884,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Most day jobs don't have much real work. ;-)<p>Actually, I should probably clarify - when doing active product development, it takes way more than 2 hrs/day of work.  At that point, you can basically forget about doing any outside programming projects.  But most jobs are very feast-or-famine: once you've written the program, you have little bug reports dribble in, or your boss asks you to reboot the server or something.  If you architected the program well, it shouldn't take more than 2 hrs/day to keep up with those.",1186433559

39889,comment,39699,39861,0,0,nostrademons,,,"No, but several times I've gone to sleep thinking hard about a problem and then solved it in my sleep.  That's why I keep my laptop by my bed.<p>I tend to get really <i>weird</i> dreams when this happens - not unpleasant, just a little odd.  For example, in high school I had a calculus midterm the next day and dreamed that I was sitting on a brick wall at an orphanage solving a volume integral while little kiddies played underneath me and waited for me to have a great fall.  I ended up solving the integral in my sleep, then found that there were <i>3</i> volume integrals on the test the next day.  Ended up scoring about 10-15 points higher than if I had not dreamed about it.<p>I had similar experiences in college with physics problems and lately with computer programs, but I can't remember the actual dreams.  Oftentimes I end up solving them in that time when you're not fully asleep but not fully awake either.",1186433376

39882,comment,39830,39830,0,0,geebee,,,"Overall, I agree.  Nut I disagree with the second half of the statement:  ""You don't need to hire an expert in language X, you can and should look for expert programmers that are willing to learn language X.  An expert can easily cross over from being a novice in any language in a matter of a few weeks.""<p>The first half of the sentence is right on, but I'm not sure about the second half.  Based on personal experience, it takes me a while to use a new programming language well.  <p>Of course, I wouldn't really call myself an expert programmer just yet.  This is partly because I majored in Math and didn't get quite as much exposure to different programming languages as I should have (I just did all my homework in C++).  But it's also partly because I actually bought the line about how a good programmer can move from one language to another easily, and figured I'd be able to pick up new languages quickly.  <p>An excellent C++, Scheme, Perl, and Javascript hacker will learn Ruby as quickly as it takes to memorize the syntax.  A genuinely smart Java hacker (who is learning there's more to this whole language thing than he first realized) will learn how to write while loops in Ruby very quickly, but it'll take a while before he/she instantly realizes when to use blocks and yield.

39878,comment,39699,39867,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I tend to be most productive in the morning - usually around 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM.  Then I typically have another productive period before dinner (it'd be 5:00 - 7:00 PM if I didn't have to commute from work), and then one before I get to bed (11:00 PM - 1:00 AM or so, 'cept if I don't have obligations like getting up the next morning it runs till like 3:00 AM, which pushes the next day further by 2 hours).  So I guess it varies among people.<p>It occurs to me that with 6 hours of productive hacking, you could <i>in theory</i> start a startup and still have a day job, <i>except</i> for the interruptions.  For example, all three of my most productive periods are bisected by an hour-long commute or the need to go to bed, making them effectively useless.  Has anyone tried telecommuting + startup, or consulting + startup?  It seems like if I could shift my working hours to 2:00 - 10:00 PM and get rid of commuting time, I'd be able to get all the work for my day job done in the 5:00-7:00 PM timeslot, and have 6 hours of useful time for my own projects.",1186432563

Generally, possession and use of lock picks is considered equivalent to the possession of a crowbar or other tool that may or may not be used in a burglary. Illegal possession of lock picks is generally prosecuted as a felony under the category of possession of burglary tools or similar statutes. In many states, simple possession is completely legal as their statutes require proof of intent. In some states, however, possession without appropriate licensure is considered prima facie evidence of intent to commit a crime (in California for example), rendering simple possession a crime""",1186432212

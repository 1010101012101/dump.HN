While some serious degree of ""bad-process"" might make it it would be unlikely to be successful.<p>Apart from blatant discrimination, tribunals mostly look for consistency in how workers are treated. So if you tell one candidate why they weren't successful there is an argument that all must be told. A simple way round this is to wait to be asked and only reply to those candidates that ask.<p>Sadly, UK companies seem to be un-necessarily paranoid about this and I have heard management claim all sorts of reasons why reasonable openness cannot be practiced during the job-interview process.<p>Generally, though, UK tribunals tend towards doing the <i>right</i> thing from my experience. In the 2 tribunals I have been present at, both sided with the company (as they should have). Both had a trade unionist on the tribunal.<p>I do think that companies have a moral duty to tell applicants why they were unsuccessful if <i>they got as far as an interview</i>, even if it is just to say ""there was a better candidate on the day"". They have made a commitment to the candidate and the candidate has reciprocated by turning up to be interviewed.<p>Companies should do the right thing rather than fear litigation.",1298468997

2254030,comment,2253870,2253870,0,0,broofa,,,"One problem with telling someone why you didn't hire them is that most (yes, most) people will disagree with you.  ""No, you're wrong I really do know [skill X], and have experience with [technology Y]"".  (Uhm, no you don't, otherwise I'd have hired you).  Or, ""but I gave you a good answer!"" (wrong again.)  At best these are dead-end arguments that leave both parties frustrated.  At worst you end up in a courtroom, as others have mentioned.<p>So, you want to know what you did wrong?  Maybe it's that you didn't develop a good enough rapport with your interviewer to show you knew how to listen to them and ""take a hint"".  Next time, be sure to checkin with the person you're talking to by asking things like, ""does that answer your question"", and ""do you want me to go into more detail"".<p>And it's great that you're looking for feedback, but why are you whining about not getting it after the fact when you could just ask for it in the interview?  When an interviewer asks you a question, do your best to answer it and if you're not sure how you've done, just frickin' ask! ""What do you think? Is that a good solution"", or, ""That's how I'd tackle it. What would you do?""  Demonstrate that you know where your weaknesses are and that you have genuine interest in improving your skillset/knowledge/whatever.<p>One of the most important qualities I look for in people I work with is self-awareness of how they're perceived.  People who lack this are a pain in the ass to manage.  In the extreme, they're self-entitled primadonnas who are impossible to give feedback to.  But even in moderation, this is problematic.  Yes, I know you don't think copy/pasting code is all that bad, or that you're l33t-speak documentation is readable enough... but it's not.  Don't make me argue with you about it.",1298468787

It's like dating - if you reject someone because someone better came into your life, what do you tell the other person? Usually it goes ""it's not you, it's me..."".<p>2) Sometimes I don't know what I'm looking for until I look. Then I get responses and realize I'm looking for the wrong thing. Then when I say no, again, it's not because of you, it's because of me. Sounds like dating again.<p>3) Finally, connections and personal relationships help. If I don't know you from Jack Adam, then it's hard to provide any sort of useful feedback if I don't have that much useful feedback. If we had a relationship, then I could give you some sort of advice on what would be a better fit for you, make a recommendation to someone else.<p>Instead of asking ""what went wrong"", maybe you might want to ask ""is there anyone you can recommend or do you think that something / someone else might be a better fit""? You never know whomever else we might know in the space that's hiring. And while we might have found for ourselves a great mate, that doesn't mean you're not dating material.

We were planning to hire someone, but the budget was cut.  We didn't read or respond to any of the resumes.<p>7. We got 1,200 resumes in 2 days so HR ran them through a filter with almost no correlation to potential suitability for the job.  Your resume didn't get through the filter.  Next time, add buzzwords from the ad.<p>8. Your resume made it through the HR filter, but we only had time to read 20% of them.  Yours wasn't pretty enough.<p>9. Your resume didn't stick out in a field of many that did stick out. You probably should have some kick-ass differentiator FRONT AND CENTER.<p>10. We read many great resumes.  Yours was substandard compared to many of them for one or more of many possible reasons.  Have 5 friends proofread it and give you brutally honest feedback for next time.<p>11. Your resume sucked but you don't.  Find 5 friends.  See #10.<p>12. You interviewed well, but someone else absolutely kicked ass.  We loved him/her.  Tough break for you, I guess.<p>13. You didn't interview well, but we can't really put our finger on it and don't have time to respond.  Tough break.<p>14. You interviewed well and are still under consideration.  But we are waiting on corporate for 27 other things.  You'll probably find another job before we get back to you.<p>15.  You really do suck.  (No you don't.  Chances are the process never got this far.)",1298466896

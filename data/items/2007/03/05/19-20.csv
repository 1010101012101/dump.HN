As a kid I had just as much interest in electronics as I did in programming, but having no money and growing up in suburban hell with no decent electronics stores within driving distance, I couldn't pursue it.  I think this is the most promising YC startup to date (based on what I know about them when they launch; obviously Reddit is successful with probability 1).",1173124424

2401,comment,2396,2396,0,0,danielha,,,"I'll be the one that points out the obvious problem in that. After realizing the strength of a domain proposal, what stops another from quickly grabbing that name? I'm assuming this is all prior to you actually registering the name yourself, since you'd sink a lot of money into purchasing every proposal you can muster up.",1173121458

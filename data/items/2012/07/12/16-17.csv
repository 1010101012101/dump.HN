Why pass the assertion to the RP via the most insecure channel possible, i.e. the client-side javascript? That was just the easiest way you could find so the RP could tie it to client's session id?!<p>Obviously the assertion must be sent from the browser plugin directly to the RP.  You could do it by injecting an HttpOnly cookie for the RP's domain with the encoded assertion.  Javascript can never see it.<p>In the case of a secondary, the secondary already has an HttpOnly session id with the end user, since they're authenticated in the first place.  The secondary would post the assertion back to the RP <i>directly</i> at a well known URL, and the RP returns a URL to the secondary with a nonce built in.  The secondary redirects the end-user to that nonce URL so the RP can give them an HttpOnly authenticated session id.  I think you can do this in a way such that neither the assertion nor the nonce will be visible to client javascript.<p>Saying, 'oh your account can only be logged into by attackers for 2 minutes if they can XSS the RP' is beyond disappointing, it's borderline negligent.",1342112396

We discovered a lot of issues with building an iOS address book replacement, and we never launched the product for those reasons.<p>1) You cannot access the recent calls list. Most people don't use their address book to keep in touch, but rather use their recent calls list. Not being able to access that list means that a huge number of people can't replace the default address book with your product.<p>2) You cannot be the default. Whenever I make a call, I am kicked back into the built-in Phone.app. This is incredibly confusing for users.<p>3) It's a momentous performance challenge. When users open the default Phone app, their contacts appear instantaneously. If you want to replace the default, you need to be sure that your address book does whatever it needs to insanely fast. We managed to get the process of syncing an address book down to seconds, but Brewster has unfortunately taken nearly an hour for me. Many, many people will drop out at this point and think the app is broken.<p>4) It's an enterprise product. Most people's address books are incredibly tiny and include bad data (nicknames, just first names, no names at all), which makes it very hard for a service to provide any type of value add. The only place where you can do an excellent job is for people with thousands of contacts.<p>5) Privacy concerns. For a product like this to have a great value add, you need to provide the service with a ton of personal data. You need my Facebook, you need my email, you need my address book and much more. Many folks will see this and drop out of the app right then and there.<p>It might be possible to get around these hurdles, but Brewster has a long way to go.",1342112048

4235410,comment,4234912,4235156,13,0,JackC,,,"I totally agree -- Posner's contribution to the law in general is incredible, and this article is a great example.<p>Tangent, re: Posner and his place in the law:<p>The thing to keep an eye on is where his approach is helpful and where it isn't. His hammer is the field of law and economics -- he predicts and explains the ramifications of laws and regulations by casting them in economic terms and applying economic theories to them. That's really useful because economics is all about predicting how people will behave and how much value they'll create in various systems, and those are things the law should worry about.<p>It breaks down, however, in cases where the debate is about <i>how</i> to assign value to behavior. For example, his 2005 discussion of same-sex marriage vs. civil unions weighs the ""outrage cost"" of the passionate opponents of same-sex marriage against the interests of people who want to get married, coming down in favor of the first group.[1] That might make sense if you assume that one person's outrage at another person's marriage is something that should be valued, like float(10-pissed-off-Tea-partiers) > float(1-happily-married-couple) -- but the whole point of the debate is whether that outrage deserves a voice in our law.[2] His argument added basically nothing to the debate (other than, in my case, a tickling sense of annoyance) because he encoded his answers to the important issues in hidden assumptions about what was valuable and what wasn't.<p>This is not to drag the man down at all, who I think is amazing. Just to say that when you see a law and economics argument -- ""we should do X, because if you view condition Y in economic terms it should lead to condition Z"" -- you have to decide not only whether you agree with the internal reasoning, but also whether you agree with the implicit translation between economic terms and reality.

In which case the police have to prove you <i>do</i> beyond reasonable doubt.<p>But you are right - it is ambiguous, and that evidential presumption is in danger of being interpreted in a very anti-defendant way.<p>But:<p>> I have lost faith in any chance of governments sticking to reasonableness<p>Thankfully, it's not up to the government to interpret legislation, it's up to the courts.

4235322,comment,4177742,4177742,1,0,asher_,,,"I think this question assumes a premise that many of the people that use PHP would not agree with. For that reason, the responses you get may be biased.<p>I am a part time developer that uses PHP, and there are a number of reasons I haven't moved off it for back end work. The first is that although it seems to be the target of dislike from those working on the bleeding edge, it is as popular as it is for good reasons. It has flaws, sure, but it is loads better than it was a few years ago, and it will continue to improve.<p>There are usually two ways that people change something. The first is being 'pushed' - something being so bad you seek out a replacement, the second being 'pulled' - seeing something so compelling in another product you have to switch. PHP isn't something that will push you away from it, I believe those switching are being pulled to other languages because of whatever nifty features they provide. In cases where you are working in established development environments on established projects, the switching costs are rarely justified for the marginal improvements.<p>I use PHP because it does everything I want it to, and its what I know. Familiarity has a huge advantage and to sacrifice short term productivity for possible long term gain is something that is easy to put off. Another thing that I love about PHP is its ubiquity and how easy it is to get in to start writing with it.<p>Fairly recently, I did seriously consider making the switch and giving two other languages a month each to see how they worked for me. What actually stopped me from doing this is that around the same time a lot of my work changed from server-side to client-side programming. My back end programming in my recent projects acts more like a simple interface between my client software and database than anything else, so I have been doing very little of it.<p>I have a few questions in response, and I ask these as someone genuinely curious.<p>How big do you think the gain is between working in PHP and working in <other language>?\nWhat do you think that other languages may be lacking that PHP doesn't that may make people not want to move?",1342110238

For example, I consider many codecs (DivX, JPEG) to be valid patents, but consider patents on certain algorithms to be invalid. Weird, huh? Because codecs are just a specialized algorithm. I just couldn't put my finger to it.<p>And then it hit me: all the patents I considered valid were <i>actual products</i>. DivX and JPEG were patented, implemented and licensed. The codecs themselves provided a leap in technology, and without that particular codec the product wouldn't exist at all. The patents I considered invalid are either bells and whistles or lack a real implementation. In other words, the creators of DivX and JPEG were making real money by developing and marketing a new technology, whereas Apple (just using the example du jour, please spare me the faboyisms) is trying to shut down competing products by just pointing at a tiny feature and screaming ""COPYCAT! COPYCAT!"".<p>The day Apple shows that it's the rounded corners in the iPad that is making them money, and not the fact that they developed a really thin tablet with great battery life and a decent OS, I might reconsider.",1342109436

But as time went on and you got more experience under your belt in the college-level computer science courses, you started to notice something: All of the really great programmersthe kind who churned out 4 line solutions for an assignment that took you 10 pages of code to complete; the kind who produced ridiculously over-featured class projects in a day while you struggled with just the basics for weeksnone of them used Nano or Pico.<p>Staying late one night to finish an assignment that was due at midnight, you happened to catch a glimpse over one of the quiet uber-programmer's shoulders. Your eyes twinkled from the glow of rows upon rows of monitors in the darkened computer lab as you witnessed in awe the impossible patterns of code and text manipulation that flashed across the screen.<p>""How did you do that?"" you asked, incredulous.<p>The pithy, monosyllabic answer uttered in response changed your life forever: ""Vim.""<p>At first you were frustrated a lot, and far less productive. Your browser history was essentially a full index to the online Vim documentation; your Nano and Pico-using friends thought you were insane; your Emacs using friends begged you to change your mind; you paid actual money for a laminated copy of a Vim cheat sheet for easy reference. Even after weeks of training, you still kept reaching for your mouse out of habit, then stopped with the realization that you'll have to hit the web yet again to learn the proper way to perform some mundane task that you never even had to think about before.<p>But as time went on, you struggled less and less. You aren't sure when it happened, but Vim stopped being a hindrance. Instead, it become something greater than you had anticipated. It wasn't a mere text editor with keyboard shortcuts anymoreit had become an extension of your body. Nay, an extension of your very essence as a programmer.<p>Editing source code alone now seemed an insufficient usage of Vim. You installed it on all of your machines at home and used it to write everything from emails to English papers. You installed a portable version along with a fine-tuned personalized .vimrc file onto a flash drive so that you could have Vim with you everywhere you went, keeping you company, comforting you, making you feel like you had a little piece of home in your pocket no matter where you were.<p>Vim entered every part of your online life. Unhappy with the meager offerings of ViewSourceWith, you quickly graduated to Vimperator, and then again to Pentadactyl. You used to just surf the web. Now you are the web. When you decided to write an iPhone application, the first thing you did was change XCode's default editor to MacVim. When you got a job working with .NET code, you immediately purchased a copy of ViEmu for Visual Studio (not satisfied with the offerings of its free cousin, VsVim).<p>Late one night, as you slaved away over your keyboard at your cubicle, working diligently to complete a project that was due the next morning, you laughed to yourself because you knew no ordinary programmer could complete the task at hand before the deadline. You recorded macros, you moved entire blocks of code with the flick of a finger, you filled dozens of registers, and you rewrote and refactored entire components without even glancing at your mouse. That's when you noticed the reflection in your monitor. A wide-eyed coworker looking over your shoulder. You paused briefly, to let him know that you were aware of his presence.<p>""How did you do that?"" he asked, his voice filled with awe.<p>You smile, and prepare to utter the single word that changed your life. The word that, should your colleague choose to pursue it, will lead him down the same rabbit hole to a universe filled with infinite combinations of infinite possibilities to produce a form of hyper-efficiency previously attainable only in his wildest of dreams. He reminds you of yourself, standing in that darkened computer lab all those years ago, and you feel a tinge of excitement for him as you form the word.<p>""Vim.""<p>:wq",1342108919

You don't <i>instantly</i> have ""locking issues"" and/or ""race conditions"" to worry about just because you use an async controller with the TPL (async keyword in .NET 4.5). The only time you have to deal with locking and race conditions is if the work you're doing is trying to cooperate and/or touching a shared resource (e.g. a static field). In the most common/basic case of receive a web request, fire off a call to a database/remote service asynchronously and wait for it to come back before you continue processing the original request you don't have to worry about anything because you're not sharing any local state and I would hope the database/remote service you're talking to has its own locking.<p>That's not to say that there aren't merits to node's single threaded execution model in that, _when you do_ need to access a shared resource, you don't have to worry about locking/coordination, but that's a whole other debate. :)",1342108902

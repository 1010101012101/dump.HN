He suggests that with the No Child Left Behind act there might be a solid business idea in developing software that looks for statistical anomalies in test scores in order to detect cheating.\nTeachers might cheat by inflating the scores of their students in order to secure more funding for their school.",1189813953

54758,comment,54465,54465,0,0,Shooter,,,"One of my first successful start-ups was software that helps make sense of the 35,000+ medical studies that are published each year.  (The software helps find design flaws, does cohort analysis, helps summarize results, etc.)   During that experience, I became very interested in nutrition research as a hobby.  I basically learned that things I grew up eating were unbelievably bad for me.  (I grew up drinking milk, eating meals centered around meat, with lots of refined, fried and sugary ingredients.  Good old Southern cooking and Standard American Diet.)  I also learned that much of what we are taught (""Milk for strong bones"") is complete bullshit when you actually read the studies.  Milk is really for osteoporosis and breast cancer.<p>We sold that company, and I stopped seriously reading on the subject.  Recently, illnesses in my family (cancer and autoimmune diseases) have caused me to get into the subject again to an even greater degree.  I've also experimented with my own diet for the last several years and I've arrived at a very different conclusion than this fellow.<p>There are tons of people that have an almost religious agenda about pushing specific diets.  They are usually well-intentioned...they just really want to believe they are right.  They publish pseudo-scientific articles like this one that have just enough logic in them to seduce people into believing them.  The media is also horrible about publishing sensational (but poorly analyzed) nutrition research.  They flip-flop their headlines so much (""Coffee Can Cure X"", then ""Coffee Causes X Cancer"") that people finally just give up on trying to understand nutrition and they just continue eating the crap that they have always eaten.  Which is amazingly sad, because proper nutrition is really the best medicine on earth.<p>I LOOOOOOOVE steak and ice cream, but a vegetarian/vegan diet has been shown in almost every study to be a more healthful diet in every respect.  And the studies that fail to show that are usually flawed and/or underwritten by industry trade groups.  There is no ""perfect diet"" for everyone...there will always be corner cases.  Some people with specific genetic predispositions SHOULD avoid grains altogether.  Apart from gluten sensitivity, there is the issue of molecular mimicry and genetic autoimmune issues, etc. <p>Modern people are dying of heart disease, cancer and strokes, though.  Those illnesses are linked to higher consumption of meat (Paleo-coronary, anyone?), dairy, sugar, cooking oil, and refined foods.  We are NOT dying of starvation, hypothermia, or tooth loss - which were probably some of the more pressing concerns in the paleolithic era.  We are also living 2-4 times longer than our ancestors, on average, so we have entirely different concerns.<p>This is really a fascinating area of research...I've noticed that tons of computer hackers are also very interested in nutrition and body/diet hacks.

93997,comment,93984,93984,0,0,apathy,,,"I posted this  on reddit and was surprised that no one had observed the same thing here (like, say, pg calling him out).<p>The arrogance contained in this rant is sad.  He ""almost"" got his MS, he ""nearly"" completed a formal education, and he twice decided he was too good to be a Jr. Sysadmin at Google.  What do Junior Sysadmins do   at Google?  They learn how to work with one of the largest distributed  systems on the planet, and they become Senior Sysadmins or Production/SRE engineers.  If you don't want to work at Google that's one thing, but unless you've got your own Big Idea (and no, ""being homeless"" does not count as a Big Idea), maybe it'd be worth the initial indignity....<p>Burning bridges in public is one thing, but I worry a little that he's burnt a bunch of bridges in front of him, not just behind.  And the small satisfaction of a rant like this is not worth it.  For perspective -- would you expect to see something like this out of Obie?  Ever?  <p>Make your own opportunities before you burn your bridges... the time for a victory rant is after you win big, not before.",1199141997

93994,comment,93984,93993,0,0,pius,,,"Yeah, that statistics essay is awesome.  My favorite essay of his, though, is how he uses finite state machines to implement protocols.  It's pretty badass.",1199140592
93993,comment,93984,93986,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"If the main people who control the direction of the framework which you use to make your living were acting in a shady way wouldn't YOU be interested? It's not just ""personal dirty laundry"" in that what the people he's talking about do, how they work, affects a lot of people.<p>Also, it's not just ""some guy.""  Zed Shaw wrote Mongrel, which virtually every Ruby on Rails project uses. Without him, Rails development would likely still be a huge pain in the ass.<p>BTW, you should read his essay on statistics; it provides a good starting point for figuring out how to analyze the performance of your sites.",1199139630
93992,comment,93984,93986,0,0,pius,,,"""Why is this interesting?""<p>I think you just answered your own question.  ;)<p>Zed (and his code) is very well-known, intelligent, and important to the Rails community.  Whatever you may think of his perspective or how it's been presented, he has some ostensibly valid criticism and it will certainly be interesting to see how people will react to it.",1199138992

Gold and other metals have always had value for various reasons (either because of their physical/chemical properties or because of their rarity). So, the day the Dollar loses its consensus, you are left with worthless paper and you might as well use them in the toilet. The day Gold, Silver and other lose all actual value is not in sight.

It's metadata and visualization attached to an album.<p>I make the distinction because story is important.  I'd suggest reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Wired-Story-Writers-Science-Sentence/dp/1607742454/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Wired-Story-Writers-Science-Sentence/d...</a> if you haven't already.<p>A storified album will only be a story if the user curates the album that way. There is a kernel of story in the demo but there will not be in every album. Questions to ask about a story: Who are the characters?  What do they want? How are they changing?  What is the dramatic tension?  If you can't answer these questions, I submit that it's not a story.<p>So, you can't automate storytelling (at least not now.)  Encompassing photos in metadata about their context IS valuable.  Context is important. So you're on to something.<p>But storytelling is very very powerful. I'm sure you have a laundry list of features to implement but I think you should  consider if there are ways to refocus on making it easier for album owners to author real stories around their photos. These are the types of narrative that compel us and resonate with us biologically.<p>Put another way: Where, when, what and how help us understand but why pulls us in.  If you can focus less on automation and more on empowerment to enable authors to weave in the why, then I think you will really be on to something.  Your site will also not be about travel and instead be about life. Because we are all living a story every moment, not just when we get on a plane.",1353300982
4802967,comment,4799163,4800846,2,0,larrys,,,"""My own experience has been, well, maybe ""unique"" is the word. While my training was in electrical engineering over the years I've had to learn a number of engineering disciplines on my own due to the various directions that life (and my own curiosity) led me through. I became a mechanical engineer, software engineer, embedded engineer, learned FPGA's (they didn't exist when I went to school), learned metal and plastics manufacturing and even became a decent salesman. All the while, when it was possible, I'd find people to replace me in certain functions. Finding good people wasn't the easiest part of my job.""<p>At least from my experience and observation over many years your experience is not unique at all (and I say that in a positive sense by the way). One thing that successful entrepreneurs (and I am referring to the type that build small successful businesses that provide a great lifestyle not large ""hit a home run businesses"") is that they are able to get up to speed fairly quickly on a wide range of things that they have no experience or knack for at all (as you say ""became a decent salesman""). Because for one thing if they are self funded and what they are doing is of no interest to ""investors"" they could never afford to pay people to do things that needed to be done. So they cut corners and make it work. And they figure it out. On their own. (And I speak from experience here starting three businesses without any co founders.)<p>PG's ""bias"" if you want to call it that comes from the fact that (from what I can tell correct me if I'm wrong) his entire experience in the business world started in the mid 90's and specifically with tech and the internet. At a time of ""rising tide floating all boats"". (Not taking away from the success of viaweb but w/o that rising tide (which he did interpret correctly) and Yahoo (they also helped Mark Cuban quite a bit) nothing else (timing is always important) would have mattered. Before that PG was an accomplished programmer I believe. As a result he would tend to frame things from what he has observed during that time period in which he was ""born"" into business like anyone would. Even to the extent that he wouldn't ever think to qualify the use of the world ""startup"" to be ""tech startup"" as only one example.  Entrepreneurship and startups of course are very broad. Some of PG's (and others) statements seem to want to confine it to a particular area of the business world.<p>""that your data seems to be used to create bias against single-founder ventures and this has to some extent permeated the industry.""<p>It seems that you are feeling the same way I do sometimes when I read HN. That there is this great injustice in that young readers are somehow being brainwashed into believing there is only one way to be in business. And to have ""success"". Similar to how certain people believe that ""Wall Street"" is business or that somehow it is more impressive and acceptable to suffer as a wannabe actor in Los Angeles than to be running an actual successful wedding entertainment business.",1353300980

4802960,comment,4802332,4802701,0,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Again, noting that I haven't tried W8 in depth yet.<p>Re: iOS vs W8 on tablets - here are the features I am interested in:\n1) Multi-tasking: there are a lot of times on my iPad when I am say, watching a movie in Safari, and would like to chat to someone at the same time, but I can't, unless I change app, which would kill the running video. W8 promises to solve this.<p>2) App switching - on iOS you switch apps with a clunky four finger swipe, which means you have to stop holding the tablet with one hand and move your fingers and swipe across the screen. W8 uses a swipe in from the edge with your thumb, which is a very easy and natural gesture to use with the way you naturally hold a tablet.<p>3) Charms bar - iOS has two ways to access core functions or return to the home screen - the home button and a four finger swipe up. The four finger swipe up has the same problems as the app switching gesture. The home button is slow to press (one thing I love about my Lumia is how fast it is to tap the soft touch home button - the big clicky home button may be iconic but in my opinion it is slow and inefficient.) Anyway the idea of a quick<p>4) Microsoft's autocorrection and keyboard layouts: another thing I love about my Lumia is the word suggestion bar. Compared to iOS's autocorrection features it is incredibly superior. On iOS you get single pop-up suggestions above where your words are actually being typed, which you can only cancel by clicking on the target itself (so every time you need to cancel it you have to tap a different place = inefficient.) Furthermore, the suggestions are often wrong, no alternatives are offered, and there is no easy way to revert them. On WP7, if you tap on a word, it selects it instantly, and displays all the autocorrect options, and the original word if it changed it. On iOS, you have to tap a word, then wait... then tap again... then the stupid pop-over text control thing appears, then you have to tap ""Suggest"" (which sometimes doesn't appear!), then another little delay, then you have to find your original word... blech. Not sure how similar W8's tablet text input is to WP7, or whether the autocorrect bar and text selection features carry over, but if there's even half of these features, it'll be an incredible improvement from iOS. I can't overstate how much text entry sucks on an iPad. One more thing: W8 has multiple different thumb keyboard size options. iOS only has one. It's way too big for my thumbs on the wide iPad bezel. AND W8 has a skewed layout thumb keyboard, which maybe doesn't look as pristine as the iPad's version, but seems to me like it would work better with actual human thumbs.<p>5) People hub and sharing - one thing I do a lot of is sharing - especially links to friends. iOS sucks for this. There's a stupid share button in the Safari browser that lets you email a link or post it to your Facebook wall (with no option to post to friends' walls!) but in no way is sharing built in to the core of the system. On my Lumia, again, I love how it integrates with my entire Facebook friends list, and it makes sharing very easy. The Share charm integrated with the People hub on W8 sounds like, if it works as it should, an absolute killer feature to me, making it ridiculously easy to share anything from across the entire OS. I like how Microsoft seems to be really trying to integrate this sort of stuff into the core of the OS.<p>6) Livetiles - again another feature that is great on my phone. There's a lot more you can do with a homescreen than just rows of dead icons.<p><i>Windows 8 isn't just a bit experimental - it's a groping attempt to stitch wings onto a monkey or a beak onto a cow.</i><p>Well, that's your opinion.<p><i>this isn't a technical solution - it's marketing strategy.</i><p>First: yes, it is a technical solution. The scenario is like this: used to be that computers were big things that sat on desks. Used to be you kept all your files on one PC and moving them from PC to PC was difficult. Used to be that not everybody used computers. Used to be that the internet was a niche part of computer use. Used to be that no one had persistent online social networks integrated into their lives. Used to be that tablets weren't prevalent. Etc etc. Then all of these things changed - and now the world's most popular OS is changing in response to these changes. These are all technical problems (or whatever you want to call them) and W8 is an attempt to begin solving these problems.<p>Second: at the end of the day, the best marketing move Microsoft can make is to build great products that take advantage of all the possibilities of modern technology. I still argue that, after a period of relative stagnation, computer interfaces are starting to respond to the massive changes in computing technology and culture. Windows 8, whether it is particularly well-executed or not, whether it fits well with the legacy desktop or not, whether it breaks some parts of the desktop work environment PC model or not, is a step in that direction - the right direction.",1353300772

Most things are better than Vimscript.\nI've even written a language [1] that compiles to Vimscript because it sucks so bad.<p>Vimscript is similar to JS. Both have lot of pitfalls, and don't have traditional OOP. The reason JS exists is to script the browser, and vimscript exists to script vim. Coffeescript attempts to add syntactic(and sometimes semantic) sugar to JS. Riml seems to be in similar vain. Despite that, there are people who would still work on dicts rather than using the Ruby style classes your script seems to introduce. == has the same rules as == in JS - don't, unless you are really sure.<p>I like the default scope thing your language does, but I feel a developer should at least know vimscript variable scopes. Your classes are nice syntactic sugar, but I am used to Lua and JS plain old object based oop, and I am Ok with using OOP that way.<p>Vimscript has its warts(like JS) but does its job. Some people swear by Coffee and disavow JS; some people prefer JS. I don't have a fanatical position - I use both Coffee and JS. Your extensions look good - I will play with it some.<p>Generally, when I take a position defending Vimscript is when the person talking about ""how vimscript is devil's spawn"" has 0 ideas about Vimscript and is regurgitating what he read somewhere. I don't deny the warts(== vs ==# vs ==?), but I do deny the fact that somehow Vimscript makes the job difficult. In fact, if you know Vim, you don't have to learn tons of api functions(though you still need to learn some). You directly use the vim commands(is there a better word for it?). I prefer it vastly over learning a new set of artificial api calls(""normal! `<v`>y"" over some crappily named copy_marks....). Oh, you don't know Vimscript and you find it difficult to read?

4802887,comment,4802332,4802448,10,0,rogerbinns,,,"BTW Android tried the whole unified search thing.  Back in the days of hardware buttons there was even one of the four dedicated to just search. A running app could detect the button press and bring up a standardized search interface.  If the search started outside an app (eg home screen) then you get the same standard search interface.<p>Each app could register as a search provider - responding with content relevant to the app itself.  The search system would aggregate the content from search providers.  If there were multiples then it would even track the historic popularity of each provider in order to prioritise the results.  (For example there are providers for your music, contacts, text messages, google search, mint etc)<p>There is a settings page where you can turn individual providers on and off.  I added this functionality to the apps I developed.  Here is the API/usage documentation: <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/search/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/search/index.html</a><p>Note how it starts out saying it is a core feature.  So core that the search button no longer exists with software buttons, although to be fair search can be shown in the action bar.  And I never met a single Android user who actually used the search functionality! Many people did have a dedicated search widget on their device, but that was a Google search, rather than the phone search. The current Android 4.2 homescreen search puts google search results at the top of the screen and device search below which is mostly covered by the keyboard and requires additional clicks to see it all anyway.<p>This is a long winded way of saying that it seems to me that search turned out to be a dud on the platform by the king of search.  I just tried search on my iOS device and it turned out to be very laggy, poorly performing and useless (eg clicking on an email search result opened the email app but not the relevant message!)  This leads me to believe search isn't used much on iOS either!<p>As you say, in-app search does seem to work well across all platforms and apps.

It doesn't quite work like that.<p>For starters, being an investor with a ton of money, you don't need to buy access to Carson. I can pretty much guarantee that people like Ron Conway, Peter Thiel, PG, Marc Andreesen, even if they didn't invest in Treehouse if they wanted something from Ryan Carson he would jump (as most rational people in the tech space would rightly do) at the chance to help them out.<p>If Carson took their money, with them assuming that there will be an exit - when he knew full well that he wasn't interested in one....well.....that's dishonest.<p>If he was very straight forward with them, which from everything I have read about him I assume this is the likely route he took, then he probably did discuss with them exit routes he will take (i.e. an acquisition).<p>The issue is, as an executive (especially a chief executive) you have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder value.<p>If you know, that your ONLY exit option is to be sold to a larger company, then publicly getting rid of your other ""legitimate, best alternatives"" essentially squanders this fiduciary responsibility.<p>In other words, if I want to buy your company. You want to sell it to me for $50MM, so all of your investors can make a good return, why would I pay that if I know that I can offer $30MM and you would be hard pressed to take it.<p>The only way for you to realistically bid up the price that they pay is if someone else wants to buy (or you want to take it public). You can't assume that someone will ""always be there"". That seems irresponsible to me.<p>The one option that every fast growing tech company has, is to go public. So it seems like a mistake to piss away that option for no upside.<p>Edit: Cisco's acquisition of Meraki is proof positive of my theory of having a legitimate alternative of going public - <a href=""http://www.meraki.com/company/cisco-acquisition-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meraki.com/company/cisco-acquisition-faq</a><p>From the CEO of Meraki:<p><i>So, when Cisco approached with an acquisition offer a few weeks ago, our initial reaction was to politely say ""thanks, but we're planning to do our own thing and take Meraki public"".

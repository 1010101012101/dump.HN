I have a friend who has shipped an iPhone game developed on a hackintosh.<p>That said, I've personally found them to be problematic over time.  We're a 6-person Mac-based game developer, and we picked up a Psystar hackintosh out of curiosity.  We had an intern work on it for awhile, but it had some weird quirks.  The biggest problem is updating must be done manually and carefully.  The longer you have it the more work you're creating for yourself, if you want to keep current, which is pretty much opposite the goal of using a Mac (less work/maintenance over time).",1230767910

Also I believe females have a slightly better survival ratio, the reasons are complicated, but include the fact that all fetuses start as female, and then are modified by testosterone to be male, i.e. female is the default. Plus females have XX so some genes are doubled which helps them.<p>It's pretty much impossible for a father to make just one or the other because of that way it's produced.<p>The father has XY cells, which split in half to make sperm, one half become a male sperm the other female. So sperm is always made in pairs.<p>There can be differences in the mother that affect one or the other differently though (PH for example, and the sperm are not the same size).",1230767242

416034,comment,416021,416021,0,0,lincolnq,,,"Bound and free variables: when I was taking a programming languages course, these concepts popped out at me as being incredibly important. But I had been programming for years without understanding that there was a distinction. Are they important for programming, or just for understanding how programming languages are implemented?<p>Regarding bound and free variables, I was reverse engineering Python's scoping semantics and discovered this little gem:<p><pre><code>  def a(x):
    def b():
      print x
      x = 5

    b()

  a(3)
</code></pre>
What do you expect? Prints 3, right? Nope. UnboundLocalError, because 'x' is referenced before it was assigned. It turns out that variable bindings in Python are all lifted to the enclosing 'scope' (usually a function block). So x is not a free variable in the 'print x' line... even though the interpreter claims it's not bound, either.<p>(This behavior is a royal pain to implement in an interpreter. You can't just recursively execute expressions; you have to scan the scope you're about to execute for free variables which are later bound in that scope.)",1230767067

The article mentions mostly the size of the files. I also understand that the lower the number of different files is, the better. What else should be taken into account on the front-end?

5273475,comment,5273110,5273276,1,0,throwaway,,,"> But don't lay on your death bed wishing you'd worked less and loved more.<p>The advice in the original article is not new. In fact it is the default advice that is given to all, very unlike what the OP has mentioned. I haven't seen any person with experience mention that personal life is a sink. It could be an advice that is ignored the most, but it definitely is the advice that is also given most frequently.<p>The term 'Workaholic', is a negative even in its name. And I don't believe anyone, who has done even the slightest of introspection, consider being a workaholic to be the most optimal condition for them. They might love their work, I do as well, but I think the intensity is often due to either grandness of their objectives or due to lack of alternatives. Given then humans have a propensity to overestimate the impact of the our own work, they also tend to underestimate the comparative value of things that do not directly and visibly help in achieving that goal they desire so dearly. And what they desire is not always what is considered acceptable or good, but what is considered extraordinary and different. We have seldom celebrated people for having a balanced life. The most important aspect of people whom we have admired, as a community, is never the balance that they have in their person and professional life, it is their impact on the world - the size of the dent they created. Hence, even though some of us know they might not make it, they hope that if they work just an hour more a day at the expense of existence of a personal life - it might increase their chances. They are ready to lose it all but never to be ordinary. These are the risk takers who have a choice at having a relationship but choose not to take it. For they fear they might die in mediocrity.<p>And then we also have the other kind, those who don't have a choice. Work being what gives them some hope of acceptance. Some relevance. I often think that one way of thinking of our primary motive is that we want to have some relevance, that we want to be remembered when we die, we want to be missed when we are missing. We want to be either extremely very relevant to a few people or be at least be somewhat relevant to masses. We do see the value of love and the value of all the very personal relationships that we have, successul or unsuccessful. We might even value them more than the relevance that we get in lives of many through our work. However, some of us are too unfortunate in the pursuit. And too afraid. And to bring some luck to our misfortune, work seems to be a safe choice. A choice is to work, for the rewards are largely under our own control and independent of how we look. Work is a safe haven in a world that has marked us to be unattractive and unworthy of affection. Of course those of us who feel this way, are at fault. We could change the way we dress, go to gym and travel; basically do things that we don't enjoy to get a chance at a game that we suck at. But we sometimes think, ""f<i></i>k it all, I will just work"" for that at least might bring some minimum guaranteed rewards. We are the risk averse who fear we might get nothing but disappointment, again, if we pursue something personal and lovely in life.",1361696298

5273472,comment,5272960,5272960,2,0,pjlegato,,,"I'm surprised that more people haven't mentioned ZFS! It's a stable, cross-platform filesystem, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.<p>There are stable implementations for Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and BSD (at least). You can export a filesystem from any one of these, unplug the hard drive, plug it into another computer, import the filesystem, and go. Doesn't even have to have the same CPU endianness.<p>Besides being designed from the ground up to be operating system and CPU endianness independent, it does a ton of other stuff that no other filesystem does. It's a total rethink of the entire filesystem / volume manager / RAID pool concept. All of these things are merged into ZFS, with a user interface that's both radically simpler and far more powerful than managing all of those things seperately.<p>You can easily add capacity to existing datasets (up to 256 quadrillion zettabytes, it's 128 bit!), do mirroring and striping at the filesystem level, and add hot standby drives. You can combine drives of different sizes into storage pools. You can do rolling drive size upgrades in the future to expand the filesystem size when drives become cheaper, without taking the filesystem offline. It has built-in pervasive checksumming and self-healing data corruption detection, there's a strong focus on data integrity despite flaky hardware, writes are atomic, you can take snapshots and roll back to previous filesystem states, there's an advanced adaptive memory caching system that's far beyond simple least-recently-used caches..<p>Is that not enough? How about built-in encryption, data compression with your choice of algorithms, deduplication of file data... You can add a small SSD drive to your huge traditional hard drive based dataset to act as an L2 cache for fast, durable writes, fully online maintenance and upgrades, builtin SMB and NFS sharing, you can stream updates...",1361696275

I kind of thought that there was a lot of media hype in that story.<p>Anyway, I think the main thing is that having kids in your thirties is a lot more stressful, in the sense that you usually want to have a stable relationship before having kids together, and time is running out. There is that biological clock ticking, at least for women - while men have more options, it means having to find a significantly younger woman to have children with.<p>And once you have children, you realize that it would have been nice to be younger. It means being in better shape to play with your kids, being able to be there for them longer, and a higher chance to experience grandchildren.",1361695961

I'm torn between admiring that they don't rush into new features and impatience with a few small things they've refused to add so far.<p><i>If someone deletes your favorite package, then you can just re-upload it from your cache and let people know about the new URL-- assuming that the code is open source.</i><p>Well yes, but then you're de-facto maintainer of that package, you might not have permission to do that, etc - this point though I feel is less important than versioning, it's more an argument for central package control, which has pros and cons. I'd be happy if Go never does that and agree that it can be worked around but will be interested to see if people judge it necessary eventually. There's nothing to stop people setting up a central package resource, and nothing really needs to be added to go to support it.<p><i>If you want to make a backwards-incompatible change in your library, then just create a new version and call it something (slightly) different. There's no reason to complicate things.</i><p>This is not an acceptable solution, it would lead to situations like:<p><pre><code>    import 'github.com/user/yaml_parser'
    import 'github.com/user/new_yaml_parser'
    import 'github.com/user/really_new_yaml_parser'
    import 'github.com/user/toms_new_yaml_parser'
</code></pre>
What a mess, particular for new users trying to decide which package is best or canonical. Why not just use versions?<p>I wouldn't be so quick to defend the status quo - Go is a young language with plenty of maturation still to do, they could easily add versions to packages if it proves necessary - I suspect in the long term it will, because large ecosystems <i>do</i> involve chains of dependencies (I'm not talking about java here, but perl, python, ruby, java, C++, etc all of these languages version libraries in some way), and <i>developers</i> of packages make mistakes which they need to fix, sometimes by deprecating or removing compatibility, but their users don't want to deal with those mistakes, sometimes for years, and the users of their users certainly don't. Choosing a new name and orphaning all your users is not an acceptable solution.<p>I'd prefer if package maintainers could just do this:<p><pre><code>    import 'github.com/user/yaml_parser'
    import 'github.com/user/yaml_parser/1.0'
    import 'github.com/user/yaml_parser/1.0.1'
</code></pre>
etc and left the master as the plain name with version tags as longer names. It'd be nice if go supported this by supporting arbitrary branches or tags on github etc but I don't think it does at present, happy to find out I'm wrong.",1361695363

Modularity and delegation would be better.<p>The main side effect of having Congress micromanaging tens or hundreds of thousands of numbers is that everyone goes for pork.  For example, everyone wants military bases in their home state.  But with a smaller budget, you might just have a single item for ""Military - Domestic Bases - $15 billion"" (or whatever the actual number is) and let the military high command decide how many are actually necessary for national defense, where the best locations are, and whether it's better to have a lot of cheap ones everywhere or a few expensive ones in crucial locations.<p>And also, having a 2-year, 4-year or 8-year budget would make a lot of sense too.  We can always write another law to repeal it if it's not working (or the next administration/Congress opposes the previous one's decisions), but we'll probably usually let it stand after we pass it.  And it reduces waste if agencies know what they're going to get well ahead of time (especially for things like certain kinds of scientific research where you're running long-term experiments).",1361694951

While it is not a ticking time bomb there definitely are certainly some fuzzy limits on the time you have to do these things that seem to come faster than you might think.

It's that the engineer is a militant libertarian, an autistic savant or a polymath of software development.<p>No normal woman wants to date a passionately unempathetic man. If you can't sympathize with poor people, or things that don't interest you (like humanities majors), how are you supposed to convince a normal woman you care about her feelings and her passions in spite of your voracious narcissism and ego?<p>OkCupid and polyamory are our sexual revolution, not ""affairs.""

Many of the services which in other OSes live in kernel space are pushed out into standalone processes.<p>The main goal is to improve reliability. Bad drivers or bad hardware are the leading cause of lockups these days. If you isolate the drivers, file system etc from one another, you can prevent the whole system from dying. Minix3 goes further than its predecessors by adding a ""reincarnation server"", which periodically pings other servers and kills/restarts them if they've become unresponsive.<p>Minix essentially does at a single-system level what cloud architectures try to do at a multi-system level: assume that the parts are unreliable, isolate faults and recover by restarting sub-units.<p>To me the more interesting possibility is that in a microkernel world you could solve a number of classic OS/system software bunfights. Databases, for example, tend to fight a bit with OSes about the best way to buffer data or flush to disks. In a microkernel system you can arrange matters so that the database provides its own memory and disk management. It's just another process; nothing special.<p>Here's the report that was written about the design: <a href=""http://www.minix3.org/docs/jorrit-herder/osr-jul06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minix3.org/docs/jorrit-herder/osr-jul06.pdf</a>",1361693037

I own a few textbooks from which I have stripped the DRM and I use a PDF reader that is comfortable to me (GoodReader on the iPad).<p>I agree with some of the commenters here that DRM appears to one of the main problems of eTextbooks.<p>It is responsible for locking students in to using the publisher's reader software which is usually buggy, limits their printing privileges, and more...
For example the publisher Cengage is now employing new DRM software that only lets you stream protected JPEG pages from the book in some HTML5 viewer, instead of their previous solution that simply used a protected PDF file. This means that you have access to an inferior version of the book, instead of the vector PDF version.<p>Publishers don't realize that a person can just scan the paper book and upload it online, thus defeating all their fancy protections. For example, I've taken multiple books from the library that had no digital editions available for purchase or a DRM that was (as of yet) uncrackable and scanned them so I could read them on my iPad.",1361692985

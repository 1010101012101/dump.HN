I'm not accusing him of not having spent a moment on it, but of missing things a moment's thought <i>should</i> have shown him.  It's actually charitable to attribute that to an oversight.<p>And you're right, he does state something close to the central point of my essay.  But if you keep reading, that's not the part he tries to refute.<p>Your last paragraph is actually the most thoughtful response I've read about this whole controversy.  But I think you're wrong to say that startups glorify the individual.  The startup founders I know are on average more idealistic than people working for big companies.  They tend to be the ones who want to make the world a better place; though there are of course exceptions, the people working at big companies are the ones who tend to think of their job as something they do mainly for the money.",1207076140

But in the same way, some of them are made harder to understand by poor design.  Continuations might be an inconvenient factorization of their underlying concepts.<p>Monads seem more fundamental to me, in that they capture a broader class of ideas, and seem less machine-oriented.  But the overwhelming number of awful monad tutorial blog posts suggests that they aren't any more convenient to think about than continuations.<p>I think maybe we're lacking a good framework for thinking about concurrency in general.  Threads seem simple at first, but make it easy for even very skilled hackers to get tangled up in race conditions and deadlocks.

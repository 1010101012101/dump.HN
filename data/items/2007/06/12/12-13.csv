Unfortunately, as has been seen at reddit and digg, the bigger the site gets, the lower the quality of the posts and conversations (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September</a> ). While I appreciate that you want to see growth, I'd hate for it to turn into yet another collection of amazing pictures.  I'm happy with the high quality crowd of 4000 daily ips.  I don't know what the tipping point would be, but if it doubled or tripled from here I have a feeling the quality of posts would drop significantly or the initial community will have to be more active in voting/moderating posts.<p>Regards.",1181651810

We derived a 3D model of an H atom using Heisenberg's equations. So when I recently saw mathematica in the news, I checked out their website and saw that they seem to be heading in the ""general programming"" direction. That made me curious about what people are using it for.",1181651087

When advertisers abuse the user, I have no problem blocking them. <p>Curiously, there is a startup in the summer cycle that's working on the problem of how to make tolerable ads.",1181650310

My online resume also contains a couple of words about it, but less explanations. I like it like that and it doesn't really bother me since:<p><pre><code>    1) I never apply through recruitment agencies, \n       unless contacted with a concrete offer that \n       stands out (and in such a case, the recruiter is\n       already interested in me)\n\n    2) Failing to answer about your failures really \n       stands out in an interview, catching you \n       unprepared. By putting a failure on your resume, \n       you're the one leading the conversation (the\n       interviewer will either ask you about it or \n       not ask you about your failures at all)\n\n    3) You don't want to work for companies with \n       brain-dead filtering mechanisms\n</code></pre>\nPersonally, I also hate bullshit. I used to interview people and it's a good thing I haven't done so in a long time, because I hate it.

Most recruitment fairs are just terrible. Companies will send the prettiest girls they can find in their HR and PR departments with the sole goal of getting your contact info plus some buzzwords so they can add those to their database. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against pretty girls, but they're not actually interested in me as a person nor do they have a lot of knowledge about the company which usually makes recruitment fairs a big waste of time.<p>On campus presentations on the other hand are a fantastic way of putting yourself on the radar. I don't mean the recruitment fairs that some Uni's will have on campus, but rather smaller events. I recently went to the final presentation of a phd project and there were 4-5 companies giving a short talk what they did in that field and afterwards they had stands with demos and the actual people who get their hands dirty were there to talk to you (extensively). To me the latter (where it's directly related to a topic I might be interested in) is much more interesting and inspiring than some impersonal recruitment fair.",1319626482

Most of the students were blissfully unaware of the start-up opportunities available, especially when the big players were dangling large money incentives and holding big promotion events. Also, if you took a typical internship with a bank, etc, the chances are that you got offered a graduate job. This in itself would prevent a lot of the students looking further for other opportunities even if they were being promoted.<p>The only time I even had a hint of the start-up world was the odd email from the career officer. (I actually remember the SongKick advert. I was really tempted to apply, even though you were just looking for a graduate position. In hindsight, I should have tried my luck :))<p>What would be useful in promoting the internships would be a start-up demo-day, where bunch of start-ups would come in and showcase their product/vision, development technologies, and any other 'cool stuff'.<p>Edit: To clarify, rather that a start-up fair, where students stumble about, the demo-day would be contained in a lecture room with a proper presentation and QA session.

First, there's probably a bias on the part of graduates to take a job with what they perceive to be a safe, secure company that will look good on their CV. I think that tendency is a cultural thing here in the UK - there's more of a tendency for people here to work <i>for</i> companies for their entire career and, hence, there's traditionally been a cachet attached to working for big companies. That's something that's likely to change over time, though.<p>Another factor is likely to be a bias on the part of universities towards building relationships with larger employers who are seen as prestigious.

A positive observation is that post-grad Entrepreneurship programs attract a lot of people who went straight to big companies and then figured out that startups were a better option for them. So grads who get it just take a year or 3 to become aware of the option.<p>I wonder if the answer lies with these recent alumni, and if there's a way to share their experience with the doey-eyed undergrads job-seekers.<p>Maybe Milkroundabout needs to bring it into the schools, and enable alumni as the awareness vector.

Having studied at a top London uni and having friends doing CS degrees at Imperial, UCL etc, none of them even considered joining a startup. It seems as though all of these graduates have their heart set on joining investment banking/trading - this is largely based on what they think the job is like, but after they join, they realise it sucks but the money is pretty good they just put up with it. This is based on 10+ of my friends working in banking and hating the hours and the work.<p>We need to foster more of a startup culture within university campuses, right now 99% of graduates don't even think about joining a startup - it just doesn't even come into their mind, totally focused on joining a blue chip.<p>Finally, many (not all!) of the startups here in London don't even have a proper business model and haven't made a profit despite being established for years.

They also organise a ton of events to show students how nice they are.<p>b) Money. No getting away from this one. A decent starting salary might be in the region of 25k, the companies mentioned above usually pay somewhere around 35k. That 10k makes a huge difference after 3-4 years of living in squalor.<p>c) Inexperience. Coming out of university a job is more-or-less a job. You write some code, get paid, that's it. It takes a bit of personal experience to fully appreciate the corporate reality of legacy code, bureaucracy and incompetence. In my experience it often takes those encounters with the beast that is corporate coding to make you run for the hills or startups.<p>d) Peers and parental pressure. Your mates are all getting golden hand shakes and nice lunches at Big Corp, it is natural to want the same. Also, when you get that job offer from PWC or similar, your parents' eyes light up with excitement and they run off to tell all their friends about it.

I've had the opportunity to work with a few startups to get them to a first release [I graduated and moved to Germany helping startups as a contractor].<p>But generally, working for startups isn't mentioned as an option to students at <i>any</i> point during their course. This is perhaps an issue with university faculty, they probably assume it's not an option since they don't have any contacts to any startups. Placing a call to Microsoft recruitment is easy.<p>Another reason might be an issue with the education students receive at university, I feel as if only 10 students out of a class of 120 people will know how to program correctly. Startups normally want people with lots of knowledge in many different areas, they don't want people who only know how to do certain things; Hiring a graduate who can only code HTML isn't normally an option for startups since they need the most out of the little money that have.<p>Until at least 50% of a graduating class are able to perform in multiple areas, backend, front-end, perhaps mobile in multiple languages (they don't have to know them amazingly well, but enough to program efficiently whilst checking documentation  when needed!), startups aren't really an option for most graduates. You would be amazed at how many students can't debug problems in their code, because they're taught to just copy code they find on the internet or on some sort of Blackboard style intranet app.<p>TL;DR: Students graduate with piss poor skills and until more students graduate with the needed skills, they'll never find themselves in a startup.",1319625010

My best hires are people who either approached us because they like why we're doing, or people in my professional circles. Professional developers fit nicely into these two buckets, were most students don't. Great companies like Tuxebo and Conversocial don't really have mass appeal. Subsequently, it's hard to get a student who doesn't truly understand the company/space excited about being a part of the team.<p>The second problem is even further exacerbated as early startups don't want ""employees"".

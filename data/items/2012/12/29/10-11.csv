4981749,comment,4977548,4980069,1,0,itry,,,"> Does that make sense?<p>Honestly, it sounds overly complicated and I still dont understand the basic principle.<p>Why not just put a music player program on my computer that streams the song into my existing network and have speakers that connect to the network and play it?<p>You say ""You get one Play:5 device"". So what is that? Why cant I just buy ""speakers"" that play whats send to them over the network?<p>You say ""CIFS/SMB"". Well, I could make my files available that way. But somehow it feels wrong. Will the song that is played then be streamed to some central device and from there to the speakers? Seems like twice as much streaming as necessary.<p>You say ""Windows/Mac/iOS/Android"". So I would have to bring one of my tablets into the game. ANOTHER machine in the mix.<p>You say ""at least one Sonos device must be connected to a wired network"" and I still dont understand why. I would understand it if you said ""to access your files"". Even thought I would prefer it to just swallow an usb stick so I dont have to fiddle with my existing IT. But you say ""to act as a wireless AP to allow other Sonos devices to connect to the network and use standard internet services"" and I wonder why do they have to? I want the ""other devices"" just to be speakers and play music.<p>The Squeezebox thing makes more sense to me.",1356778527

4981692,comment,4980588,4981294,3,0,Chattered,,,"> I'm still looking for someone who can present a cogent explanation of monads using only Python.<p><i>Personally</i>, I don't do monads in any other language than Haskell. I find monads painful even in Ocaml. I'm pretty stupid as a programmer. And --- especially when doing things such as monad transformers --- I need lots of type checking and lots of type inference to help me over my mistakes (which are <i>pervasive</i>).<p>The cool thing is that when I've written these things called ""monad transformer stacks"" (see Real World Haskell for what I guess is the best explanation for those), I find that when my code gets through the type checker, it really does just <i>work</i>. It works, even when I've lost any sense of what my code is actually doing underneath. Without the type system, I couldn't have any confidence of this, and the runtime bugs you can potentially get with monads are so subtle that I would be terrified to use them in a language like Python (note again, I'm stupid, and YMMV).<p>The other reason why I wouldn't do monads without types is because, to me, monads <i>are</i> the type. The semantics of a monad is pretty much just that type (plus some crucial axioms). Types in Haskell are much more expressive than in most languages. The way ""operator overloading"" works in Haskell means that by specifying types, you are often generating runtime code (think C++ templates, but not for too long). That's why you see more type annotations in Haskell compared to (say) Ocaml. Though if you want to do the same thing in Ocaml, you'll be knee deep in the even more verbose world of these things called functors.",1356776401

Right now the main site is dark background and light text and then suddenly there is a box with a jarringly white background with a generic blue button that really doesn't mesh with the rest of the site at all glaring at you.<p>Also, having multiple popups back to back is almost insulting to your users. If they take the effort to dismiss the first popup, the last thing they want immediately after it is another popup. I was almost afraid to hit the close button on the 2nd (create a clip) popup because I thought another one would popup somewhere else on the page. If I clicked on some kind of ""Tour"" button, it would be acceptable to point out all the social features of the site or where to goto create a clip and such. If I came to a video page to view a video, the video should be the focus.<p>Another mistake I think is the ""neil thinks this is the best part..."" popup. I understand there is a sense of community and social features to the site but so do 90% of the sites users go to these days. A better way may be to present related videos or other videos ""neil"" has created that add value to the user instead of forcing the focus to be ""hey this is neil's video guys!"".<p>Another thing you could try doing is moving the 2nd popup that asks you to make a clip appear a bit later. Maybe a minute after the video starts playing or even better, at the end of the playback of the video when the visitor has completed what the visitor initially came to the page for. The nice thing about this is that by the time the 2nd popup appears, the user has had a chance to soak in the site's layout and content and see why 'making small clips from long videos' can be a good thing.<p>The branding strip is nice but it blocks a part of the video. Making it translucent (60%-75% transparent) would make it a little less annoying as I can still partially see the video as opposed to completely blocking the top part of the video as it does now. And having it as ""hover"" based action may be good too. That way when the user moves the mouse over to start playback or pause or stop the video, the bar will appear. It should also fade out after the video has been playing for a few seconds.",1356775901

4981674,comment,4979080,4979784,3,0,miami-dade,,,"The moral of the following retail pricing story is that it's profoundly difficult to assess the value of any product in a vacuum. Subjectively evaluating government acts presents the same difficulties as evaluating products; in both cases display makes all the difference in the world.<p>For the story, imagine you're a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles, and you want to buy your wife a fur coat this Christmas.<p>To be expedient, you visit Hunky Dory Coat Factory on Rodeo Drive. A delightful antique display and friendly faces greet you upon entry. Decorative plants, backlit with colorful lights, are beautifully positioned next to a grandiose marble checkout desk. You make your way forward and an unobtrusive attendant smiles kindly in your direction. Dark mahogany wooden floors span the interior, glimmering in the light as you see the coat you came for. As you inch closer, you know it's the one, but you can't help noticing every coat at Hunky Dory costs over $5,000. You pick up your wife's desired coat despite much apprehension. You go straight for the price tag, slowly turn it over, and incredibly, it's only $1000. ""What a tremendous deal,"" you think to yourself.<p>Now take a look at what happens if we repeat the above at Dilapidated Coat Factory.<p>Dilapidated Coats is located in a crummy old warehouse with high ceilings and noisy industrial fans. The coats hang from a dusty rack on the opposite wall with no organization. The floors are unfinished concrete and the walls are chipping paint. As you move closer, you notice that most coats on the rack cost under $50. But to your surprise, you come across the perfect fur coat for your wife. You inspect the price tag, and you're shocked to find it's $1000. You leave disgusted.<p>The point is, when the product's environment changes, the price you expect to pay changes too. Perceived value is driven by environmental factors. Display makes all the difference.<p>It follows that how you perceive isolated US government actions greatly depends on whether you favor the state of America's economic and political affairs. Just like Hunky Dory's extravagant display made a $1,000 coat look like a deal next to $5,000 coats, if you think America is truly incapable of repeating history, you may think all American laws are passed in good faith, or rationalize all government efforts away as positive.<p>Surveillance, being a precursor to force, is at least worthy of extra scrutiny.<p>First and foremost, the U.S. Constitution was expressly designed to limit government power. By this logic, in order for the US Government to make good faith interpretations to the Constitution, legislative measures must err on the side of limiting government power, surveillance measures included. Under no circumstances should any new measure conceivably facilitate tyranny, nor should the measure employ clever word games to enable such a scenario.<p>If you can entertain the notion that the American government has been corrupted by money and outside influence, and that the US Dollar isn't infallible, you may start to consider the possibility of a scenario where surveillance measures like this one are used to restrict freedoms, and increase government power during stressful times in order to perpetuate failed systems. Therefore it matters greatly whether the political and economic environment looks Dilapidated to you. You're free to think it's Hunky Dory. That is your choice.<p>Assuming the US government is acting in its own interest, even if it were OK to monitor international communications for increased security, it doesn't compel the government to codify rules into law with hedge words like ""intentionally"". To think, the subversion of your Constitutional rights now hinges upon whether surveillance qualifies as ""intentional"" according to a legal scholar's interpretation. The use of the word ""intentional"" here shares the same audacity as the NSA's classifying of American communications as ""intercepted"" vs. ""stored"". Either way the NSA gets to summon your records on demand, so who cares whether it's technically ""intercepted"". Just the same, who cares whether surveillance is intentional or not? This bill appears in effect legalizes dragnet surveillance over the American populace. According to William Binney, surveillance is already done dragnet style across the entire US populace, so it's not like they're ever going to ""Intentionally"" surveil most American citizens anyway. They do it by default, they do it today, but now they get to point at this word ""Intentionally"", and claim state secrets privileges while strong-arming the populace out of their Constitutional rights.<p>I urge you to watch billionaire investor Dr. Michael J.

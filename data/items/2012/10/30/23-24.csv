4720410,comment,4720121,4720121,18,0,derefr,,,"You tend to use the very specific phrase ""nootropic drugs"" to talk about drugs which help with productivity or creativity or some other aspect of working life. Asking whether there is evidence on nootropics, is just asking whether there are any heavily-tested nootropics. Asking anything else--to lex it out, whether ""drugs that have no productivity-enhancing aspect, enhance productivity"" is just playing the fool to incite extremely subjective flamewars.<p>So, let's avoid that, and just focus on nootropics. Is there evidence that they work? Depends on the drug. We have drugs (caffeine, theanine) that are in foods we've been consuming since the beginning of civilization, so we've heavily researched those and are pretty confident in what they do.<p>On the other hand, new, synthetic compounds, like modafinil, are only really created and pushed through FDA approval if there can be found some sort of therapeutic, non-nootropic purpose in their use: in modafinil's case, treating narcolepsy. This means that their use <i>as nootropics</i> is much less well-researched, and consists mainly of anecdata (however much there is) shared over the internet.<p>The best you'll find, I think, in terms of data for efficacy of various drugs, is people who have set out to do double-blind studies on themselves: <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics</a><p>After reading data-points like these, you might be convinced to try some of them on your own. But be aware that people's body-chemistries can vary widely--especially where things affecting neurochemical balance are concerned--so everyone's reactions to these will still be different. Not in a sense of a ""bad trip"", usually; just that some things which other people swear by might not have much of an effect on your particular chemistry. So, the best thing to do, as in most situations: first research, then experiment.",1351641565

4720407,comment,4719383,4720289,4,0,RichardPrice,,,"It's harder than you are suggesting to find a leading indicator of future engagement. You want to find a metric that is relatively foundational, and is going to produce engagement across a variety of dimensions later on (visit frequency, tendency to pay, tendency to add content, tendency to invite others etc).<p>For instance, when signing up to Facebook, there is a bunch of stuff they want you to do: add friends, invite people, add content like photos, and come back on day 1, day 2, and so on. It turns out that it's the first activity that is more predictive of future engagement than the others, and specifically 7 friends in 10 days is an important threshold. You can't figure that out from your intuition alone, and you definitely can't get the values of # of friends in # of days just by consulting your intuition, or your sense of what's obvious.<p>At the same time Chamath from Facebook was keen to point out that there was nothing mystical about what the growth team at Facebook did. He said the best way of describing what they did on the growth team is that they:<p>- Measured things<p>- Tested things<p>- Tried things<p>His main take-away was that one should be extremely rigorous and analytical when thinking about what drives engagement, and not rely on your gut, or company lore.",1351641483

But at the time I stopped using google, one of the reasons I stopped was that the quality was so low.<p>Hell, the quality of Google is so low that Bing is actually running ads right now with blind taste tests where people preferred bing.  Of course this isn't scientific at all, but my point is-- no big scandal has erupted about how wrong this is.  It's totally plausible for bing to do this because everyone realizes that google has gotten to the point where <i>microsoft</i> can plausibly compete with them!<p>Page rank was really cutting edge, but that was 10 years ago, yet it is still their primary mechanism.  It's been gamed, but they seem uninterested in moving to more sophisticated mechanisms (they use them but the influence of better methods seems to be too low) ... meanwhile they've used their bully pulpit to influence the web to conserve page juice which has backfired in such a way that actual links to authoritative and useful sites are lower ranked than spam links, making it easier to game.  (When wikipedia is using no-follow on relevant outbound links to pages that wikipedia is quoting or citing, things are fundamentally broken- no site on the web has a more favored ranking position than wikipedia. Not to mention hand curation of pages. You can't even correct errors there without having them reverted by some know-nothing whose sole accomplishment is rising in the ranks of wikipedia editors, so its not like they need this to prevent spam.)<p>This means the site that google unquestionably considers the most authoritative, when it cites a page that it considers authoritative, google gives that site no credibility.   But let me create a web of sites that construct text that passes grammer parsers as ""good english"" but whose purpose is to spam keywords and link to each other and I can rank for those terms up close to wikipedia.  (This is essentially what techcrunch is doing only they are having humans write low quality text instead of a computer.)<p>It's broken, and google broke it.",1351641349

E.g. they love individual characters, but the larger messages are completely lost. I don't think pop cultural references started appearing until the Shrek series, which included a bunch of funny, adult pop culture references. I think they did this for a really simple reason: to make it easier for parents to take kids to the movies, and still get some laughs. Throwing in pop culture references makes the parents laugh, but kids pay no attention--they love the animation, expressions, sounds, etc. And parents are more likely to sit through repeated viewings because of this.<p>My kids get their ""bearings"" from their Judeo/Christian upbringing, both at home and at school. That is their ""culture"", not the characters they see in Disney movies.

Now if you sell it as shares or are flavour of the month and can get silly offers, the prices seems to be over consumer valuations.   Though even after this news, the share price has not changed much and still values Disney at around 90bn.",1351640601

4720349,comment,4719768,4719768,5,0,thaumaturgy,,,"We've deployed a number of challenging wifi installs over the last few years, trying out a bunch of hardware+software approaches. Meraki is one of the ones we haven't tried, mostly due to their enterprise cost.<p>So if you're interested in this kind of stuff but willing to try out something other than Meraki, try Ubiquiti (<a href=""http://www.ubnt.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubnt.com/</a>). They're our current favorite wireless equipment vendor. Very reliable hardware, really really good prices -- enterprise class wireless for close to off-the-shelf consumer prices. I liked them a little better when their hardware could easily be reflashed to Robin/open-mesh, but Open Mesh has since gone and moved to their own hardware offerings, and Ubiquiti got hit pretty hard by the FCC for making it too easy for hackers to circumvent radio power settings, so they tweaked their ROM chip without updating their model numbers and everybody got screwed by that for a while.<p>The Ubiquiti management console seems pretty decent so far. We just did an installation for a client where we were seeing 10dB - 20db of difference between his Cisco wireless router and the Ubiquiti unit in the same room. We did have some trouble with Ubiquiti's Java-based management software that ate up almost an hour of troubleshooting time, so there is that. There are ways to do ""cloud management"" with Ubiquiti's hardware (I liked CloudTrax better...), but it's not real great right now.<p>If you want to get a wireless point-to-point backhaul going up to around 8 miles, you can do that for about $3,000 of Ubiquiti gear -- really cheap for that kind of thing.<p>Engenius is another popular brand. We initially liked them a lot, their support for flashing their units to other control software was really good, and Engenius still has a deal with CloudTrax, which is our preferred cloud management software. Unfortunately, their radios just stink. We've had a ton of hardware failures, and we've eaten the cost on some of those. I'm not sure if that's the hot/cold differentials we get here or what, but they just don't seem to last long. In fact ... come to think of it, I think every single one of our Engenius units have been replaced out of necessity. Yuck.<p>We started out with the off-the-shelf Linksys / Cisco / other routers option, and honestly those really aren't worth the trouble unless you just want basic coverage with fancier management options. Now that Cisco has finished eating Linksys, if you're looking for an up-to-date replacement for that trusty old WRT54GL, try Buffalo's wireless routers. We set up a client with an N300 unit not too long ago. The hardware seems really similar to the WRT54G series (according to my hardware guy), but the built-in Buffalo software was already basically dd-wrt so we didn't feel the need to re-flash.",1351640468

Something that might flourish if it were let loose as an independent startup can easily languish at a company that has bigger fish to fry.",1351639729

The most important method I found was to do a video - take your idea and convert it into a video. This will come in handy for most of your audiences, team, recruits etc. if you make it emotional, you quadruple your audience esp if your product is likely to be a consumer , education or other retail type of product. We made a video of our beta users (classroom of kids & teachers) and had many requests to put it on our website (its unlisted at the moment) or copy to Cd, by parents and other schools. The video gives you a means to tell your story in ways that a mere product demo can never do. Hope that helps. Marissa. Check us out: www.cashtivity.com",1351639712

I did not have a solid enough understanding of trig or high level algebra to calculate or manipulate equations expected of me so I would bomb all the exams.<p>If you can't fully understand low level concepts how can you even expect to even grasp the broader view? It's like trying to explain multiplication to someone who has no concept of addition. To understand a topic you must also understand all the sub-topics that make it up, and once you grasp all the moving parts a problem by nature become much more intuitive to you. This also includes math equations, if you are expected to know an equation dont JUST memorize it but instead understand why its necessary, how to derive it, and when you can and can't use it. You'll be able to look at an equation/function/program and pull things out automatically just by looking at it that may have taken some time and work to conclude before. This is very similar to Scott Young's learning ideology that I also recommend reading up on. [1]<p>Therefore after that semester I took some time and reviewed my algebra and basically re-learned trig from the ground up (it was very weak). Calc and Calc2 came a lot easier to me after this.<p>In college you must continually fill these gaps in your knowledge as every professor is different and has different expectations in student's knowledge. I've got in the habit of taking topics(whether it be a CS topic, math formula, ect) that I don't fully understand and writing it at the top of a blank sheet of paper. I then just start writing as if I was explaining the topic to my girlfriend. You'll quickly figure out where your gaps are and then know what you need to work on (which may include writing one of those sub-topics on a blank sheet and starting from there).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/03/29/studying-and-holistic-learning/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/03/29/studying-and-holi...</a>",1351639056

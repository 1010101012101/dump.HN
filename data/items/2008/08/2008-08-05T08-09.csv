267309,comment,267170,267244,0,0,gojomo,,,"The article is pretty sloppy with numbers and definitions. There's no indication their survey of 3000 is representative of all pentamillionaires, for example.<p>But, there were about 106 million 'households' in the US in the 2000 census. Perhaps there are 110-115 million households today. If 930,000 of those households have a net worth over $5 million, that's very roughly in the 1% range.<p>Wikipedia's article on {Millionaire}  suggests about 9 million households have a million-dollar net worth, so 930,000 at the 5-million level seems plausible.<p>So it's not that 1-in-100 Americans are pentamillionaires as individuals, but almost 1-in-100 live in a pentamillionaire household.",1217925159

And how can you resist right then? After all, you’ll only make your situation worse; you’ll make it more difficult for them to sort out the mistake. And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand? The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin’s thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! We didn’t love freedom enough. Every man always has handy a dozen glib little reasons why he is right not to sacrifice himself.""<p>Doesn't this quote answer your question?, firearms are much more effective than axes hammers  pokers and whatever, we have the God given right, weather or not whatever tyrannical government may happen to be in place recognizes the 2nd or not.

Most people have lots of ideas... but in my experience the overwhelming majority of these are very bad ideas.<p>I think it's worth considering the possibility that living in the bay area benefits startups by letting founders see lots of what does and doesn't work, and thereby helping them avoid spending time on some of their very bad ideas.<p>(Of course, this cuts both ways: I doubt you'd see an Amazon.com come out of someone who had spent years in the bay area -- more likely you'd get a response along the lines of ""You want to sell <i>books</i> online?

267286,comment,267170,267170,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I don't think that the 80% extends past this guy's sample group of 3000. In fact if you do some ""fermi calculations"" it doesn't appear to be the case that 80% of pentamillionaires in America come from startups.<p>The article claims there are 930,000 pentamillionaires in the united states. 80% of that is 744,000.<p>There are about 1.1 million lawyers in the USA. Let's say the top 10% have a net worth of 5 million. Thus 110,000 of those pentamillionaires are lawyers. So we've got 634,000 left.<p>There are about 700,000 doctors in the USA. 15% of those doctors are surgeons and anesthetists, specialties where you can make $500K/yr. So, 105,000 pentamillionaire doctors...<p>529,000 pentamillionaires left.<p>750 MLB players + 460 NBA Players + 1700 NFL players = 2910.
Let's multiply that by the past 10 years = 29,000 current or former pro sports players who are pentamillionaires<p>500,000 pentamillionaires left<p>I'm getting a bit tired to do this math, but it seems like there must be 100,000 guys in the financial sector who have a net worth of 5 million dollars. So - 400,000 left.<p>Add in movie and TV stars, rock and pop music stars, guys who manage movie/TV/rock/pop stars, executives in the entertainment industry, the handful of other sport stars and entertainers who make a lot of money... that's probably another 100K. Down to 300,000.<p>Now think about all the guys who rose up the ranks of fortune 500 companies. There's probably 100 guys at each fortune 500 company who make a mil a year? Now we're down to 250,000.<p>Someone please correct me if I'm padding the numbers too much. I could be dead wrong on the number of rich finance sector guys, or totally wrong about how much money the top lawyers and doctors save. But, I also totally left out other rich people, like presidents of universities, university coaches, directors of rich nonprofit organizations, and so forth. Even if my math is off it really doesn't seem likely that 80% of the pentamillionaires in the USA came from startups. It seems closer to 10-20%, if that. Not trying to be a debbie downer but 80% seems way off the mark.",1217923419

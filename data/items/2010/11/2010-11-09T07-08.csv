Have some consideration for him.<p>2) Your goal when starting to learn programming is not to learn the syntax of any one language, it's to learn to solve problems using programming. 
- Learn about P-code ( or psuedo code )
- Learn about Simple Data Structures. 
- Learn about conditional( if-then-else ) constructs 
- Learn about iterative( for-while ) constructs, 
- Learn how to declare variables and initialize them;
- Learn how to edit-debug-run code
- Learn how to version-control code (any file in general)
- Learn how to write functions/methods/sub-routines.
- Learn how to comment your code for future debugging<p>These are fundamentally the same in almost all modern programming languages. The syntax changes from one to another is mostly cosmetic. The key is good coding and problem solving habits and attitudes.<p>3) It's easy to spend time on the internet and be anamored about a particular language, particular OS, particular editor etc - but in the long run, they are commodities; there's no great big differences between them<p>4) If you really want to work in python, do so. Finish your problems in VB.NET and re-write it in python. Just don't impose your preferences on your teacher and entire class.

VB.net really is a better suited language to learn to program, and although I don't really like it myself, I agree with everyone saying it's a great language to start with.

My view is that if the software is of good quality, it will work like that.  If it's of bad quality, it'll sort kinds work some of the time like you expected. :-)<p>In general, saying that certain bugs aren't really is usually a cop-out (not saying you're coping out, just that this is what I hear as a typical excuse).  In industry, you're usually quickly taking feature requests out of the ""bug"" category very quickly, and ""working as designed"" is usually the result of misunderstandings, not software failure -- and is also quickly pushed out of the bug category.

It's an approachable modern language backed by a huge framework with easy access to web, Windows and console programming. The IDE is free and relatively user friendly for someone familiar with Windows, which is much more likely than anything else.<p>Don't underestimate VB.Net. It has a terrible history but most of that ended with VB6. Another bonus is that once you know VB.Net the jump to C# is trivial and now you know 2 in demand languages. You can also compile the same code into a program along side F#, IronRuby and yes, IronPython.<p>You aren't there to learn syntax, you are there to learn to program. You should absolutely learn Python on your own as well, knowing one will make the other much easier to pick up anyway.

You might also have to do some extra work to accomodate them transitioning out of your service.<p>Let's say you have a simple reminder list site. All the work you did (assertions, constraints on database tables, memory limits on the PHP process, whatever) assumed that users would have at most 200 todo items.

But in the short term, what I would do, roughly in order of priority, is:<p>* Do some quick queries to see if any other users will hit the same problem soon.<p>* Temporarily tweak the app wherever possible so it works with up to 900 items.<p>* Communicate all of this to the user. Sorry, we didn't anticipate this, if you really need that many todo items, we're not the app for you. Offer them a refund. Point out that things will work for now, but they are near the newly raised limit.<p>* Help the user transition - ""if you want to leave us, tell us when you've stopped adding new items, and we'll email all of your existing items in an Excel spreadsheet""<p>* Fix your app so users can't create more than a few hundred items.",1289286626

But I always forgot my good ideas in the process of drying off/getting dressed, before I could write them down.<p>So I went out and bought an underwater slate (divers use them to communicate and record information underwater).  It's probably 6""x9"", made out of plastic, and has a pencil attached with a cord.  I can jot down notes/sketches/doodles/whatever when I come up with an idea,  and take the slate with me when I get out of the shower to record in a more permanent fashion.  To erase, I just scrub it with a green scrubber sponge.  I love it - it's paid for itself many times over.<p>I also tried bathtub crayons.  They're good in that you have more surface area to write on, but they wash off more easily and it's not as convenient to permanently record whatever you wrote down (it's hard to take the shower wall with you when you get out).",1279749058

1536645,comment,1536356,1536356,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I've recognized this phenomenon in myself in the last several years, but I never articulated it this well. I would just tell people that I had a ""one-track mind,"" and that even though I find myself analyzing things a lot, it tends to gravitate towards whatever I happen to be working on most.<p>I have observed this several different times in my life: When I thought I was in (actually out of) love in high school, that was all I could think about, and I put out a ridiculous amount of poetry describing my ""anguish"". At various times I got caught up with different games: Everquest, Chess, Minesweeper, Battle for Wesnoth, Poker, and Chess again; at each point, I found myself spending all my leisure time on a single game, and all of my idle thoughts considering different opening sequences, or mine layouts, or starting hands: whatever was applicable to current ""addiction"". When I have been in relationships, I find that I tend to be consumed with not only the small disputes (as pg describes), but with things like ""sweet"" things I can do or say to make my s.o. happy -- thoughts tend to drift toward planning, anticipation, reconciliation, and any number of other difficult bits that are part of a serious relationship. At various points I have also found myself wrapped up in technical things like math, physics, computer science, and startups in general. And lately my top idea has been the nature of life, human relations, introspection, and psychedelics.<p>So for me, it basically seems to be whatever is currently consuming the majority of my consciously-used brain power. Some social problems are hard and require a lot of brain power to try to solve. The same goes for philosophical or cash flow problems. Of course, topics in math or science or engineering are most likely to take up this brain power, but for me at least, those are the things that I tend to procrastinate on the most.<p>So even though I find myself inclined to consume my top idea space with relevant technical stuff, I tend to nudge those out of my mind when I'm thinking consciously, instead focusing on more immediate topics (entertainment, socializing, paying bills). The worst part is that I <i>know</i> that if I'd only restructure my free time to actually work on worthwhile things, I would see my productivity increase many-fold due to the ""Top Idea Effect"". I'm really not sure what's stopping me from doing that.",1279748648

Followed closely by ""What are my coworkers thinking about me?""  Social approval is a powerful motivator, particularly when that social approval is essential for your continued livelihood.  Only the most self-confident (or delusional ;-)) people can completely ignore their boss's opinion and focus on innovating.<p>I suspect that at least some of Google's success has come from the hands-off culture of its management.  You don't generally fear your manager's disapproval, since the bulk of your review comes from your peers.  OTOH, you're still thinking about your coworkers' approval, and while it's a bit easier to ignore many people than it is to ignore one person, it's still hard.  I suspect that one reason why startups can still out-innovate Google comes from an intense focus on their product, instead of being distracted by all the other perks, projects, and people at the Googleplex.<p>Similarly, scrappiness in a startup isn't just a matter of saving money.  It's also a matter of avoiding distraction: when you're thinking about how awesome your life is, you aren't thinking about your product.  You want enough perks so that employees don't have to have other things intrude on their consciousness (like where to buy lunch or what will happen to them when their COBRA benefits run out), but not so much that the perks distract from the project.",1279748366

This is exactly why I <i>always</i> have at least two current projects to work on. When I get stuck on some problem in one project and cannot solve it in a reasonable amount of time (depends on the project, could be 5 minutes, could be a day), I will force myself to stop working on it and do a full context switch to another project.<p>My subconscious mind grinds on the problem in the background without me having to exert any real effort thinking about it, until it finally finds a solution and raises an interrupt in my conscious mind.<p>This process has become so effective, that if I can spot a problem coming, I say to myself, ""I should figure out how to solve X"", and don't think about it. A few days later when I come back to it, as if by magic, I have a solution already starting to form.<p>This is the same phenomenon that causes you to wake up in the middle of the night with an answer to a question you were thinking about earlier in the day... usually, ""who sings this blasted song?""<p>The brain is an amazing, complicated, wonderful thing.",1279748161

More on Glander by Taleb: ""It is an irony that the academy does not have a word for the process by which discovery works best –but slang does. I was trying to describe in a letter what I am currently doing: French would not let me. But argot lends itself very well... I am involved in an activity called “Glander”, more precisely “glandouiller”. It means “to idle”, though not “to be in a state of idleness” (it is an active verb). Gandouiller denotes enjoyment. The formal French word is “ne rien faire” (to do nothing), which misses on the active part –so do words that have a languishing connotation. Glander is what children without soccer moms do when they are out of school. It resembles flâner which has this perambulation part; though Glander does not have any strings attached. The Italians have farniente but it is really doing nothing. Even the Arabs do not have a verb for Glander: the construction takaslana from the Semitic root ksl denotes laziness (other words imply some inertia).""<p>Newton was a “glandeur”; In Dijksterhuis 2004:<p>George Spencer Brown has famously said about Sir Isaac Newton that “to arrive at the simplest truth, as Newton knew and practiced, requires years of contemplation. Not activity. Not reasoning. Not calculating. Not busy behavior of any kind. Not reading. Not talking. Not making an effort. Not thinking.

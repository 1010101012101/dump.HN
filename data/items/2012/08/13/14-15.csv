When you're fundraising you have to build the excitement to a big wave - a wave which, judging by this post, is still building in many people's fertile imaginations.<p>The excitement is important: It focuses people and gets them talking and causes them to want to keep the party going. And if you're, say, Apple, you strive to kick off the excitement at a time when you can <i>feed</i> the ensuing wave of interest with a steady stream of <i>finished, profitable products</i> that people can buy and use and show to their friends.<p>But with these Kickstarter-y projects the product is never finished when the hype peaks, so there's inevitably going to be a crash of excitement during the long doldrum where nothing seems to be happening. In fact, what's happening is that the builders are doing the work that you've paid them to do, but the creation of actual working product is <i>so</i> much less exciting than the brainstorming phase. Especially when the product is experimental.<p>But that's how this works, so it is essential to <i>calm down</i>. It's tinkering time, people! Whiteboards and screwdrivers!

I mentioned it because it's relevant.<p>Perhaps, but I think my sarcastic tone was warranted, at least before giving a serious answer. You could have said:<p>""I don't have a Twitter account. How would I follow something like this?""<p>Instead, you chose the more snarky:<p>""Guess what: not everyone has a Twitter account. Freaky, I know.""<p>which takes on an almost condescending tone.<p>Anyway, I've been annoyed myself with the walled garden approach that many of these social sites are taking. Even Facebook has RSS feeds, but it isn't exactly obvious how to get to them. And Twitter seems to be more and more going towards the route of closing off third-party access. But if you're determined enough (and I realize most people won't be; even my finding of the RSS feed was mostly an intellectual exercise), it does appear possible to satisfy your requirements of using your existing Feed system to keep up to date with Twitter posts without having to have a Twitter account.<p>But like you, I would also have expected that I could simply put the Twitter URL directly into my Reader and have it auto-discover the RSS feed as most proper implementations do. Sadly, this is not the case, and having to somehow know the internals of the Twitter API as a user and not a developer is incredibly convoluted.<p>Edit: For posterity, I went ahead and removed the snarkiness.

Both have a legacy of accumulated complexity, and some programmers dislike the buden this creates. Others are genuinely concerned that Oracle is positioning itself to profit from the accumulated legacy in the same way the author complains that mainframe vendors have done. The community of people that tends to develop around a language matters immensely in shaping the character of the code that inevitably accumulates.<p>Java has a history of conservative implementation choices (E.g., see Guy Steele's account of some of those choices at [1])  Having lived through both, the Java world of a dozen years ago reminded me so much of the COBOL world of the 80's, I personally chose to move on to more innovative communities. I still occassionaly write Java, and am always struck by how memory-intensive it is and by how it always seems to abstract by spreading things out rather than by compression.<p>Regardless of your own preferences and choices, my recommendation to younger programmers would be to work hard to avoid getting stuck in any language rut.

The article talks about an ""initial agreement"" made between Nintendo and Sony and then ""Later, it was supposed, Sony would be permitted to produce its own all-in-one machine..."", notice how it wasn't something that was agreed upon by both parties, but rather something entirely from Sony's end.<p>My take is that Nintendo put forward this venture to both Sony and Phillips, and Sony came up with an initial idea and proposed that to Nintendo. While Nintendo were considering the proposal Sony got too hyped up in the idea and ""supposed"" additional areas in which they could generate more revenue from the venture, completely ignoring Nintendo in the process. In the meantime Nintendo got a better offer from Phillips and initiated the process to accept their proposal. Suddenly CES rolls around and Sony with their heads in the clouds made the assumption they got the deal and made the public announcement, only to have Nintendo later correct them.",1344867563

4375906,comment,4375164,4375465,5,0,thirdsun,,,"I doubt it will be anywhere close to the quality that bandcamp currently offers. Given that this is Kim Schmitz we're talking about, I guess this will taste more like Grooveshark, operating in a very gray area, instead of a really caring about artists and listeners. But we'll see.<p>Besides I couldn't be more satisfied with bandcamp - this is a great place for artists and music enthusiasts alike. Everything from the flexible pricing options to the wide range of available formats and details like the lightweight and flawless HTML5 audio player and overall site design are very much appreciated. And perhaps most importantly there's actual talent to be found on bandcamp - it's hard for a competitor to build a similar community.<p>I may be wrong and this is very subjective and speculative but as far as I can imagine the average megaupload user I would expect to see a lot of low quality ""DJ berbazz""-kind of artists on Megabox instead of the ecclectic selection you would find on bandcamp. On the listener side - and again, if the Megaupload user base is anything to go by - I would imagine people that aren't that much into obscure indie artists and rather expect to find popular artists from major labels. For obvious reasons I guess that won't happen though - unless, of course, Megabox aims for Grooveshark's approach to featuring the repertoire of major labels.<p>Again, the last paragraph is pure speculation and just reflects what I expect from a music service by Kim Schmitz.",1344866631

Can do low level, although probably not the best choice for really down-to-the-metal stuff (if you really need all the optimization you can get and don't want to deal with GC). Due to its pretty decent library support and compilation speed/build system, it's also a bit more suited to application where you might reach for a scripting language, as turnaround doesn't suffer too much. There's also a pretty strong concurrency support, using the CSP approach.<p>So no really narrow sweet spot. A good language for general network programming, which might include some framework web stuff, but also could involve writing your own custom servers and consumers.<p>There's probably a better language for each individual task, but go is quite solid at a wide spectrum of tasks. Good community, too, if a bit fanboyish.",1344866628

But unlike a fission reaction that takes place in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs, the fusion reaction is not self perpetuating. It requires a constant input of material or else it quickly fizzles out, making the reaction far safer. And unlike what you might have seen in a recent Batman movie, the chamber cannot be transformed into a nuclear bomb.</i>",1344866565

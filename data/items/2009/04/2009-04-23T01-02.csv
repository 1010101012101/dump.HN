574936,comment,574459,574827,0,0,Glide,,,"I found this interesting tidbit on the HAProxy page:<p>Keep-alive was invented to reduce CPU usage on servers when CPUs were 100 times slower. But what is not said is that persistent connections consume a lot of memory while not being usable by anybody except the client who openned them. Today in 2009, CPUs are very cheap and memory is still limited to a few gigabytes by the architecture or the price. If a site needs keep-alive, there is a real problem. Highly loaded sites often disable keep-alive to support the maximum number of simultaneous clients. The real downside of not having keep-alive is a slightly increased latency to fetch objects. Browsers double the number of concurrent connections on non-keepalive sites to compensate for this.<p>Don't know if it's true or not, but it doesn't take much thought to realize if someone wanted to DDOS a server they would use persistent connections.",1240451826

The biggest problem I had was the lack of 3G (which is t-mobile only on the G1), since once in a while my phone would decide it needed to download, for example, an update, and there went all my bandwidth and all my minutes, too (and I was never allowed to get 100MB for $20; the most I could ever get was 10M for $15).  So, last month, I broke down and went with a month-to-month plan at t-mobile, and since I can get unlimited data while paying the same as I was paying on a GoPhone account, I'm happy, and I don't have to nervously check my minutes every day and put my phone into airplane mode near the end of the month, etc.<p>If you really don't have the money, this could be worth it, but a similar thing was months of stress for very little savings, for me.",1240450698

The standard target is continuation passing style.  In this form, the stack-building constructions appear directly in the code.   The ones that are merely administrative (bookkeeping the stack without real utility) can be eliminated at compile-time.  Those administrative constructs include the ones that would make tail-calls use ""stack space"".<p>Guido refers to how every ""stack frame"" is heap allocated so they can't be reused.  That's a design choice in the compiler's closure conversion mechanism.<p>Guido also refers to stack traces and exceptions, but these would be explicitly represented in the all-tail-call form of the program as well.  What he means is that the language has no tail positions because there is always implicit work to be done in the language as he defines the semantics.  That seems like an odd thing to brag about, but that's what he's doing.<p>But then I'm one of the programmers who has been permanently warped by learning about CPS, and I thoroughly rely on tail recursion being available and implemented efficiently.",1240449229

574890,comment,574423,574618,0,0,brushbox,,,"I'm not sure I understand your argument about stack traces and functions doing nothing. With TCE (tail-call elimination) the problem with stack traces are thus:<p>* with self-recursive functions it is no longer possible to see how many times the function has called itself (since the stack trace is collapsed to a single entry for the function rather than a proper trace of each call). This is a non-issue in my opinion - unless you have a language that also lets you know what your function call parameters were for each stack frame (if not then you are left with 'manually' working out where the recursion went wrong). As for debugging - it makes no difference since every self-recursive call made has no further effect on the computation.<p>* with ordinary tail-calls the issue could be a whole lot more noticeable as it means that given an error the stack trace will no longer contain any information on how you got from A (where you started making a series of tail-calls) to B. This one bears more thought (and I'd be interested in how Scheme implementations deal with this).<p>You further say ""You don't record every function call even though that would be very useful for debugging"" and I don't agree. Every debugger I've used records every function call on the stack (effectively the path to the current node in the call graph). If you meant that it doesn't record every function called in the history of the execution of the application - I agree that is useful and can easily be handled with a good logging infrastructure (and I'm sure that at least a few good debuggers would support such a log feature too). In fact, such a logging approach would possibly be an adequate solution to the tail-call problem. However that solution would need some extra ""assistance"" in order to be a valid approach in a ""pure"" functional language.",1240448970

411850,comment,411043,411373,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"<i>The funny things is that the same result for an orbit on a sphere doesn't need the Axiom Of Choice at all. It just uses the concept of actual infinity.</i><p>I had to read this several times before I understood what you were saying.  But you are right.  The point is that you can get what wikipedia calls a <i>paradoxical decomposition</i> of a groups of rotations, and that doesn't require choice.  Converting that into a proof of B-T requires taking a member of each equivalence class, and that does require choice.<p>The proof on WikiPedia is pretty good, actually:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_paradox#A_sketch_of_the_proof"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_paradox#A_sketch_...</a><p>The point about the orbit on a sphere not needing AC is really step 1 of the proof there, except using rotations on a sphere as the ""location"" of the free group.<p>As a side issue, B-T is proof that there isn't a finitely additive, isometry-invariant measure on R^3 that's defined for all subsets.  Interestingly, there <i>is</i> such a measure on R^2, although it's now 26 years since I proved it.",1230461292

411847,comment,411693,411776,0,0,taylan,,,"jmtame is right; work-life balance shouldn't be your top priority, it shouldn't make you question the time you are investing in your startup. as you make progress opportunity cost of your time increases, i.e. an hour of your time when you got funded is a lot more precious than an hour when you were just starting out. also, an hour you spend on the ""life"" side is an hour NOT spent on your startup, and the cost for this increases as you make progress.<p>luckily, things are dynamic and you don't have to choose between work and life or some arbitrary balance point and then live with your decision forever. rather, depending on your time constraints your radius of interaction widens or shortens. while working hectically on some feature you'll only interact with very few close friends or no one at all, and when things are going slow or when you need support, emotional or otherwise, you'll simply reach out to more people. thus, be flexible in terms of how you allocate your time but always with an eye on the prize.",1230460355

I think the analogy of our universe being like an ""embedded system"" is a good one. I don't doubt that there's much more to it than we can understand, much like the betta can't understand why he's stuck in a fishbowl, or the hypothetical Mario who can't understand the invisible wall.<p>On another note, does anyone else find the ""big bang"" theory incredibly unsatisfying? I have no reason to believe it's not true, but as Yegge points out it seems to bring about more questions than it answers.",1230460277

It is a short-cut response that nature has given turkeys to know how to behave. It tends to work well in nature. But, tricky scientists recorded the cheep-cheep sound and placed the recording into a stuffed Polecat, the natural enemy of the turkey, and found that the mother turkeys adopted the stuffed polecat. Coddled it and cared for it.""",1230459072

</code></pre>
Glad you brought that up. I too thought about this as a middle ground solution between ""boring your self to death by writing dozens of SQL queries and hand mapping to your model"" and ""black box ORM that generates crazy SQL queries"".<p>I'm not sure it would work though. One of the problems I see is inherent with code generation approach: what happens when you had to modify the generated code and then changed your meta-model and want to regenerate the model again ?<p>Besides, the problem of ""fitting square pigs in a round hole"" would remain: SQL is much more versatile and flexible than objects/structs: you simply can't just work with the a table=an object abstraction, which tends to yield inefficient database queries and/or headaches from the developers side. Example:<p><pre><code>    update table set one_field=value where some_condition_on_another_field.
</code></pre>
How would you expect an ORM to generate a ""dense"" query like this with it's simplistic view of things ?<p>The same applies for the select queries, especially for reporting and data aggregation needs, where you would select some columns from multiple tables, possibly with formulas and computed columns.",1316257136

ORM's provide a lot of value for the 90% use case that people often need to bang out under various time constraints (mvp, project for a customer, etc).<p>There is a trade-off when using an ORM that you, or your team, should be aware of. Once you start hitting the limits of what an ORM can reasonably do for you, it's fine to either:<p>- drop down to using handoptimized sql for specific queries / submodules of your project (e.g. a set of reporting pages)
- figure out if you are trying to punch a cube through a circle by using a relational database over a nosql type storage, and consider moving part of your data to a different storage.<p>I haven't had a lot of experience with nosql databases yet, but I think it's also interesting to consider that relational databases have been around for a long time, and alot of corner cases where they are unwieldy are known. Nosql databases are not as vetted against reality yet, so abolishing one for the other may amount to nothing else than trading one set of problems for another.",1316257112

3007706,comment,3007615,3007652,7,0,kunley,,,"ORMs are useful for one thing for sure: for making an illusion that OO way of thinking and relational way of thinking fits.<p>But they don't fit really!<p>I like the way original author explained it: the problem was that people were forced or convinced to use wrong abstractions. Due to the massive marketing of really big players since 80s, relational databases are everywhere around; most of developers during the years took for granted that they MUST use SQL, so they stopped thinking if they really need relational model.<p>Luckily we have other setting these days. There are plenty of production-ready non-relational database engines. To simplify your application layer and really <i>map</i> your OO data, please do use document database - they fit. That's it. No amount of pretending will dissolve the differences between relational model and object-oriented model.<p>If in doubt, please go back to the theory, to the computer science. You don't have to dig through tons of papers from 70s when relational model has had its peak of scientific evolution - you just buy yourself the CTM book and go through all the computational models with examples of the real code. Please do the lesson. Otherwise any discussion will be about habits and beliefs again, not about science and engineering.<p>And - I hate to say it - most of the comments like ""here we go again"" are really about habits and beliefs. How sad. The foundation of our occupation is hard science and engineering. We strive to build better things based on such concrete foundation. By sticking to the thinking ""OO + relations fit"" we abandon this foundation and we are turning into believers of some cult created decades ago by the marketing people of the few companies everybody knows in order to massively increase sales of RDBMSs. This is not engineering.<p>Please, put yourself in the distance from the habits of using specific tools you're accustomed to; please think about it.<p>[edit typo]",1316254531

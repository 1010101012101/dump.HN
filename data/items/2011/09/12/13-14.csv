The God-electron would have omnipresence, but no omnipotence or indeed any other of the qualities usually ascribed to gods (other than the obvious, the negative energy those ideas tend to bring with them).",1315835990

2987277,comment,2987003,2987003,32,0,saurik,,,"The only thing I feel is wrong with this (really: the /only thing/, which is fricken awesome... I love PostgreSQL from the bottom of my heart, and have been using it for almost all of my database needs since the late 90s) is ""per-column collation"": collation is not a problem ""per-column"", it is a problem ""per-index"", which means you really want it ""per-operator class"".<p>Here's the use case: you have a website, and you have users using it in English and French. With per-column collation, you are being advocated to have two fields, one english_name, and one french_name, that have /the same content/, but are defined using a different collation, so that the ordering condition on them becomes language-dependent.<p>The effect that has is actually terrible: it means that the size of your row (and yes, this may end up in TOAST, but there is still a massive penalty to going that route) ends up becoming ginormous, and the size of your row will just get larger the more languages you want to support as first-class citizens in your app.<p>Instead, what you /want/ is to just have an index english_ordered and an index french_ordered, and you want to be able to select which index you use for any specific query. If you ""do it right"", you'd also want to be able to support ordering the data using German collation, but it would ""just be irritating slower"".<p>Now, if you don't use PostgreSQL much, this may seem like a pipe dream of extra standards and complex interactions (""how will you specify that?!"", etc.). However, it turns out there is already a feature that does 99% of this: ""operator classes"", which is how PostgreSQL lets you define custom collations for user-defined types.<p>Only, PostgreSQL operator classes are slightly more general than that, as you can specify an operator class to be used when performing order operations for your index; and, even more importantly: they are already being used to work around a specific case of operator-specific collation.<p>Here's the example: let's say that your database is set up for UTF-8 collation, and yet you have this one field you want to do a ""prefix-match"" on: WHERE a LIKE 'B%'. The problem with this is that you cannot use a Unicode collation to index this search: it might be that 'B' and 'b' and even 'Q' all index ""exactly the same"" for purposes of this collation (and there are some other corner cases with the other mapping direction as well).<p>So, to get index performance for this field, without changing your entire database to collate using ""C"" collation (which works out to ""binary ordering""), you have a few choices, with one of them being to create a index that uses the special ""operator class"" called text_pattern_ops (""text"" in this case as the field is likely a ""text"" field: there is also varchar_pattern_ops, etc.).<p>Once specified in your index, PostgreSQL knows to use it for purposes of the aforementioned LIKE clause. You specify this while making your index by specifying the operator class after the column.<p><pre><code>    CREATE INDEX my_index ON my_table (a text_pattern_ops);\n</code></pre>\nThe next piece of the puzzle is that an ORDER BY clause can take a USING parameter to pass it a custom operator, and you can always (obviously) use a custom operator for purposes of comparison. So, you now are in the position where you should be able to do this:<p><pre><code>    CREATE INDEX my_index ON my_table (a english_collation_ops);\n    CREATE INDEX my_index ON my_table (a french_collation_ops);\n    \n    SELECT * FROM my_table\n        WHERE english_collation_less(a, 'Bob')\n        ORDER BY a USING english_collation_less;\n</code></pre>\nSo, really, the only thing that needs to be specified, is we need the ability to have ""parameterized operator classes"": as in, we really need a ""meta operator class"" that takes itself an argument, the string name of the collation, and then returns an operator class. With this one general technique defined, we not only drastically increase PostgreSQL's user-defined type abilities, but we better solve this whole class of collation problem.<p>(Unfortunately, I suck at e-mail, or I'd get on the PostgreSQL mailing list and try to argue for this in a more well-defined way; maybe someone else who cares will eventually see it and become this feature's champion; or, of course, come up with an even better solution than mine ;P.)",1315835801

I'll leave alone the third-rail topic of Microsoft, but Facebook is an interesting case because they only became prominent after the domination of their niche by MySpace, and yet now they're dominant.  Was MySpace a monopoly?  Well, in the Microsoft sense, yes, but not in the pre-1980-AT&T sense.  Yet, as soon as a solution people preferred came along, they were no longer.<p>Can a business get to 100% of a market, or nearly so, without state help?  I think they often can.  Can they <i>hold</i> that position in the face of better and/or cheaper startup competition, without state help?  I think that's an open question, and I lean toward thinking that they can't.<p>The other major question is so-called ""natural monopolies"", such as infrastructural service provision (phone, power, cable, etc).  The fact that there are communities which have multiple competing firms in some of these seems to show that they aren't natural in the sense that they will arise unless prevented.  While most communities in the US have a legislated monopoly on, for example, cable service, those that do not often have competing cable services, which is exactly what we are told won't happen.  (My father lives in a place with three overlapping cable companies, as it happens, and he's tried all of them at one time or another).  I've seen people in some of those communities who are arguing for a city-granted franchise switch seamlessly from arguing that regulation is needed to keep monopolies in check to arguing that such regulation is needed to prevent the wasteful laying of lines that duplicate existing lines.  I guess that's neither here nor there, just a pet peeve. :)<p>Anyway, searching on Rothbard and monopoly will turn up more rigorous arguments against the idea of free market monopolies than I've given here.",1315834108

2987108,comment,2986379,2987046,6,0,nadam,,,"I live in Eastern Europe. I have worked at the local branch of several multinational companies. When I applied to a job, I solved the interview problems and then I was offered a slightly more than average salary the same way as my colleauges. None of the interview questions were deep enough to mirror how I think about really hard problems. The only way I can really measure myself is to work on problems like the Netflix prize, build my hobbyprojects (and I participated in math competitions when I was a child), etc.., but these are not related to my day-job. I earn $36000 a year currently.\nI once started a topic on HN where I have written this: please give me a very hard 'test' task (which can be solved in one or two days, but very tricky), and if I can solve it I would be interested in remote work for more than $36000 a year. (Which is slightly above market in Hungary) But no one answered.<p>About your 3 points: I agree that having these in one person is a good combination. However people are rarely exceptional in all 3 points. Some guys are exceptional algorithmizers, others have really good intuition for enginering, creating an amazing design (for code), yet others have exceptional memory so that they can dive into huge bloated shitty code, and yet others deal well with monotony (when you have to do unchallanging tasks, or deal with other people's shitty code).  Some people are fast like hell, others can grow beautiful thoughts if you give them days to think about a problem. But I agree that a bit of all of this is needed mostly. Also being strong in one territory you can emulate other strengths. If the tasks are not on your limit, you can emulate fastness with smartness, and emulate smartness with being fast. But when the problems are hard enough that you are at your 'limit', this emulation no longer works.",1315833170

If you're lucky like most of us in technology, you struggle for relevance rather than survival, but it's a fight nonetheless. Work very hard, anticipate conflict, and do the right thing even if it hurts.<p>First, the claim that we're ""entitled"" is an old saw. Whenever a downtrodden group (not that Millennials are ""downtrodden"" in absolute terms, but in relative terms we are, as a group, quite unfortunate) starts asserting itself, the first thing the opposition does is claim that it's ""uppity"", ""impatient"", and ""entitled"". The second thing it does is focus on extreme examples-- man-hating ""feminazis"" instead of mainstream, reasonable feminists, frank perverts instead of normal LGBT people, racial nationalists like Garvey instead of King, spoiled upper-middle-class 22-year-olds refusing perfectly decent entry-level jobs-- as an excuse for ignoring the more numerous moderates who have a compelling moral point.<p>Next, I think it's useful to delve into a political philosophy that's endemic among our generation. Personally, I'm a libertarian. A left-libertarian. A true libertarian. For philosophical and theological reasons, I believe the objective of society is to maximize individual liberty, health, and creative freedom and that this often involves (preferably lightweight) ""socialist"" measures, but that small government is better than large (in the same way that 500 LoC to deliver the same functionality as 20,000 LoC is superior). As soon as full employment becomes untenable (and it looks like that may be the case) basic income programs are in order.<p>All this said, there needs to be examination of the difference between <i>absolute</i> and <i>relative</i> rights, because this is where right-libertarians (the ones who currently use the name, ""libertarian"") embarrass themselves and our society (cf. healthcare). There are very few absolute rights. One is the right not to be murdered, but there is no ""absolute right to life"" (God will deny me that ""right"", and though I hope my death doesn't come too soon, I'm glad that it will someday happen). Another is the unconditional right to refuse sexual contact for any reason. That's an absolute right: not to be raped. A third is the right not to be coerced to work, except in life-threatening circumstances. Food, shelter, healthcare are not absolute rights. They are <i>relative</i> rights, contingent on the resources available. If food is plentiful, then everyone (even ""useless"" people like, I don't know, myself 28 years ago when I was 18 inches tall) has the right not to go hungry. If we are stranded where is no food, a ""right to food"" makes no sense because there is no food available. All this said, <i>relative rights are just as morally meaningful as absolute ones</i>.<p>The people currently called ""libertarians"" (i.e. right-libertarians) focus on the absolute rights that apply anywhere, even in 476 AD in Bavaria or 1849 in Death Valley or 2075 in outer space, and not on the relative ones that depend on social infrastructure. It's rugged individualism. This is a severe mistake. Those relative rights are just as important.<p>This seems like a digression, but it's extremely meaningful. If our generation can be characterized, I'd say that we're intensely <i>libertarian</i>, but we tend (on average) toward left-libertarianism that looks a lot like liberalism. We've seen that social conservatism is a moral disaster, but also that big government doesn't always work. Differences between us and the older style of liberalism are (a) that we're more practical, willing to rally behind a centrist presidential candidate if he's obviously an intelligent and good human being, (b) we're extremely skeptical of governments and we're fiscally conservative as a result, (c) we have a <i>world</i> focus and don't buy into it when someone tries to tell us we're special because we were born on a certain patch of land, (d) in general, we're anti-war, having seen the immense loss (of life, and of finances) that occurs when people are too quick to pursue violent action.",1315833073

That first line just isn't enough, especially when the whole summary is just a few words more (e.g., clicking on ""Bullet"" adds ""and rigid body dynamics."")  The search results should probably include the library tags, and maybe the full first paragraph.<p>- Pages for individual frameworks should probably include links to comparable frameworks (see osalt.com, for example)",1315832886

That's followed by some vague benefits that could apply to a lot of products - ""Basecamp’s focus on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use make it truly unique.""<p>There's no denying that Basecamp's a huge success and a great product, but when looking at Basecamp's main landing page, I see way more appeals to emotion than features <i>or</i> benefits.<p>Hmmm. <i>Very</i> interesting.",1315832819

I don't drink coffee, so I need any non-chemical stimulant I can get.<p>3. Anything too catchy will encourage me to hum it in my head, which actually has a similar effect to lyrics, disrupting my internal verbal processes.<p>I've found the perfect thing that works well for me, which is <i>soundtracks from RTS games</i>. They're instrumental, vaguely electronic, and specifically designed to fade into the background and create a general sense of urgency and focus.<p>If you are a big starcraft player for example, playing the background music from starcraft can create a sort of Pavlovian Response, telling your brain ""You are sitting at a computer carrying out a difficult task which takes a good deal of focus and mental exertion.

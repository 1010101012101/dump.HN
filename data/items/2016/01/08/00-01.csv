They don&#x27;t help, but it&#x27;s also the responses.<p>There is a major psychological effect from getting <i>attacked</i> for stating an opinion you might hold to heart. As an avid reddit/hn commenter, I feel it often.<p>I don&#x27;t really care if someone disagrees with me on something minor, but if it&#x27;s something I truly believe is important and I see people disagreeing with it left and right and downvoting anything in line with that opinion, it makes me feel weakness and despair.<p>Weakness: I am overwhelmed by the people disagreeing with me. I can&#x27;t answer everybody. Not because I don&#x27;t have the arguments but because it&#x27;s pointless, won&#x27;t lead anywhere and will achieve nothing but make me look insane. The &quot;hivemind&quot; effects makes widely-held opinions even stronger and minority opinions even weaker. Alone, I am powerless to counter that.<p>Despair: Let&#x27;s say someone thinks gays/black/women/whatever shouldn&#x27;t [have some human right]. You truly believe that&#x27;s wrong. If someone says to me &quot;I think women shouldn&#x27;t have the right to vote&quot; and is impossible to convince, I feel pretty awful about it. I feel like that person is contributing in making the world worse, and I live in that world.<p>Now what if that&#x27;s not about some minority-held opinion, but about something far more widespear? What if it&#x27;s, for example, similarly insensitive and disgusting comments about islam/muslims? I don&#x27;t just feel awful being around that person, I feel crushed by the amount of people who would agree with it. I&#x27;m quite afraid of what happens when such opinion is widely held. I feel like I&#x27;m looking at a lifetime of awful and I feel crushed by it.<p>My fiancée is a muslim. This is empathy kicking in. Not everything affects me that way, but I&#x27;m far less likely to comment on something I don&#x27;t hold to heart.<p>But yes, I do enjoy HN because the hivemind effect is far more limited. The hidden downvotes and sorting algorithms are a million times better than Reddit&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not ideal, but it&#x27;s still an excellent place to have discussion and a &quot;good enough&quot; place to have debates.",1452214654

It is not that uncommon to do this kind of &quot;lifestyle business&quot; thingie where the primary goal is freedom and time, not necessarily money.</i><p>Why the condescending tone for those businesses?<p>The main motivation behind startup is making loads of money. Similar to casino players, hoping to the big payoff. There&#x27;s more risk of course, but that&#x27;s not the motivation -- else startup founders would be as likely to be daredevils like Evel Knievel.<p>Startups don&#x27;t care much about the actual business aspects (actually making money from what they do) as much as getting VCs to pour money in and then exit.<p>OTOH, the motivation between lifestyle business is not just freedom and time, but also the product. A custom motorcycle shop or some company making a software tool like BBEdit, for example, with extremely passionate people putting tons of hours into what they do, are &quot;lifestyle businesses&quot;. Where in a &quot;startup proper&quot; a founder can be just as happy to sell their to some giant company that while close their main product (acquihires and tech acquisitions).",1452214585

The first 15k can buy you reliable transportation which is more valuable than the fun from a sports car. 15k can also pay for a year of housing and food in many places, which has way greater utility than the ability to drive like a jackass on the highway.<p>With your N dollars, you might not enjoy the popcorn without butter, but you could also buy something else to eat, or some fuel, or any number of other things that have more utility than butter on your popcorn.<p>Every dollar adds additional things that you could purchase.

Losing years or even the entirety of the remainder of one&#x27;s life to imprisonment is (for me, at least) an extremely scary thought. The sort of treatment you can expect in prison is absolutely dehumanizing. You aren&#x27;t a name anymore, you are a number.

First, if it&#x27;s proprietary software, you&#x27;ve licensed it, you don&#x27;t own it, it&#x27;s not yours, you have no say what the policy is. The company lawyers could make a case such an EOL switch is necessary just to avoid liablity once they&#x27;re no longer providing security fixes.<p>If you want this kind of choice, the only way is free and open source software. That&#x27;s the reality, and it&#x27;s been that way for a very long time, just read the EULA. It isn&#x27;t yours. They&#x27;re not doing things &quot;to you&quot; by preventing it from working, they&#x27;re protecting themselves. Free software could decline to work by default, with something like an about:config opt out feature. That&#x27;s because free software belongs to everyone.<p>Next, hardware. Apple, the most among all the companies making hardware, explicitly reserves the right to modify the hardware after sale. There is in effect a hardware EULA. Your rights are fairly limited to turning it off or disposing of the phone. You don&#x27;t have a right to modify it, you don&#x27;t have a right to jail break it, you don&#x27;t have a right to run software that Apple doesn&#x27;t, through its license that you&#x27;ve agreed to, approve of. Not only is the software not yours, there is tacit residual hardware right reserved by Apple. I don&#x27;t like it, you don&#x27;t have to like it, that&#x27;s how the agreement effectively works though. So if you really don&#x27;t like it, then you shouldn&#x27;t buy those kinds of products.<p>Android, it&#x27;s fairly similar license wise, but there is at least in most implementations the option to enable 3rd party software installation. So you could install some ancient unpatched web browser if that&#x27;s what you wanted to do. And of course Cyanogenmod and other free OS&#x27;s you have a lot more control because the software is yours by virtue of you having possession of it.

As I&#x27;ve tended to live somewhere for longer than 6 months, I&#x27;ve lived in a place long enough to get settled to some degree and as a result, acquired &quot;stuff&quot; - living stuff such as small items of furniture, quilts, pillows, kitchen utensils, some consumer electronics (I&#x27;ve got an iMac and a laptop now) and so on. Stuff you need if you&#x27;re not living out of a hotel for 6 months. That has been the biggest cause of stress and pain. If you can do without stuff, and I&#x27;d suggest if you live somewhere longer than 6 months you probably can&#x27;t and unintentionally you&#x27;ll start acquiring it anyway, then it would be far easier. If you can live out of a suitcase and laptop bag for 6 - 12 months, then seeing the world is a much easier prospect.<p>I&#x27;ve never intentionally moved to new places, it&#x27;s just how things have worked out but this time is the last time!

Opt-in by default<p>Net neutrality debates aside, I love BingeOn since day one and didn&#x27;t notice much of degradation of video quality when I watch videos with BingOn (I still left it on)<p>All the arguments EFF against BingeOn, T-Mobile can easily tweak their program to easily comply.<p>Regarding #1, I suspect it&#x27;s more of a technical challenge than an illicit intent [2] (of saving data bandwidth, which of course if the win-win situation T-Mobile wanted). Some like YouTube has proprietary steaming intricacies that T-Mobile have had technical difficulties to selectively &quot;Throttle&quot; or &quot;Downgrade&quot; only content partners so it&#x27;s easier to just do it for all as hinted by this WSJ article about YouTube&#x27;s reluctance of signing on BingOn.[3]<p>As far as #2 goes, again, no doubt T-Mobile wanted to save their bandwidth at the same time get credits for it putting a marketing campaign around its practice, but EFF (given the sensitivity about Net neutrality) and YouTube(very opinionated about user experience on video quality) certainly have different viewpoints about it.<p>In the end, as a T-Mobile customer, my heart still sides with John Legere&#x27;s latest unconventional and controversial un-carrier move because<p>A) I still have a choice to turn BingeOn off (though I won&#x27;t as I would rather save 2/3 of my data cap to do something else and very gladly and gracefully accept my zero-rated video content allowances on partnered video sites.)<p>B) I am optimistic about T-Mobile to eventually figure out a way to selectively (as opposed to indiscriminately) &quot;optimize&quot; video content on only partnered video sites so that it will be more compliant with net neutrality. There is a technical challenge to overcome after all.<p>C) Despite of profanity and inappropriate wardrobes, I, as an mobile customer, love what John Legere has done for wireless subscribers in the U.S. and the direction he set for the industry.

By deterring would-be-criminals, it keeps innocent people safe, without even having to send the would-be-criminals to jail.<p>Except that it isn&#x27;t a perfect deterrent. Crime is still a major factor in society. To give just one example, 20% of women in America experience sexual assault at some point in their lives. And then there&#x27;s robbery, assault, manslaughter, homicide... Some crimes are committed by those who&#x27;re mentally unstable, or in the heat of the moment. But the vast majority are committed by criminals who are fully aware of what they are doing. People who would never do it if they knew for sure they would go to jail, but think they have a good enough chance of getting away with it. They either think they won&#x27;t get caught by the police, or even if they did get fingered, they can find some loophole or weakness in the prosecution&#x27;s case that would enable them to beat the rap. And the likelihood of the latter really comes down to how high the burden of proof is. A guilty person is much more likely to get convicted in a legal system where &quot;n = 5&quot;, as opposed to &quot;n = 10.&quot;<p>Psychology studies show that punishments are most effective as deterrents when they are consistent, immediate and guaranteed. The greater the variance, the better the chances of someone getting away with it, the less powerful the deterrent effect will be. Which means you&#x27;re going to have more victims of crime. More victims of assault, kidnappings, rape and murder.<p>Which is really what the trade off should be all about. <i>&quot;It&#x27;s better that N innocent people fall victim to crime, than for 1 innocent person to go to jail.&quot;</i> Now what would your answer for N be?",1452213661

I try pretty hard to do research that is (a) potentially industry-relevant (key word:  potentially); and that (b) industry won&#x27;t do for various reasons.  Thus far, it&#x27;s seemed to work pretty well.  Using my favorite example of the week, take some of our work on cuckoo hashing -- it&#x27;s contributed quite a bit to the literature of how to implement fast cuckoo hashes, contributed a new and fairly intriguing data structure for approximate set membership, and produced a design that I know to be in use in two Very Large Companies(tm).<p>The companies wouldn&#x27;t have done this work, at least outside of their research labs, because the solution&#x27;s theory is too far from the need of any one problem.  But the result -- a more memory-efficient hash table design -- turns out to be broadly useful.<p>And yes, I do consider this to be &quot;industry-relevant&quot; research.  I&#x27;m not going to solve their problems for them -- but there can be great synergies between industry and academia for having broad impact through adoption.<p>(full disclosure:  I&#x27;m an academic on sabbatical at Google for the year.  It&#x27;s likely I&#x27;m a little biased in my belief that both have value.  But this isn&#x27;t a bias unique to me;  systems as a general area is close to industry, and most of my colleagues rotate in and out of industry periodically via sabbaticals or startups.)",1452213563

To the author&#x27;s credit, he posted his benchmarking code so we could try it ourselves.  (Much appreciated.)  But as it turned out, there were problems with his benchmark.  A fair comparison shows a mixed picture -- hdf5 is faster in some cases, and numpy.memmap is faster in other cases.  (You can read my back-and-forth about the benchmarking code in the blog&#x27;s comments.)<p>One minor complaint about presentation: Once the benchmarking claims were shown to be bogus, the author should have removed that section from the post, or added an inline &quot;EDIT:&quot; comment.  Instead, he merely revised the text to remove any specific numbers, and he didn&#x27;t add any inline text indicating that the post had been edited.<p>I think the rest of the post (without performance complaints) is strong enough to stand on its own.  After all, performance isn&#x27;t everything.  In fact, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a minor consideration compared to the other points.<p>When it comes to performance, I think the main issue is this: When you have to &quot;roll your own&quot; solution, you become intimately aware of the performance trade-offs you&#x27;re making.

You set a threshold for making random decisions, and adjust that probability up and down as you try to optimize.  For example you might say that in each step there is a 10% chance of adjusting the COST factor randomly by a factor between 0.2 to 5.  If you&#x27;ve got 3 tables, most of the time you will come to the current optimal decision.  Most of the rest of the time you will make one suboptimal choice.  Run that a few times and you&#x27;ll should several plans that are suboptimal but not actually horrible.  Keep running and playing with the randomness factors until you either have enough plans, or are basically making entirely random choices and can&#x27;t get enough.<p>As to the algorithm described in the comment, it is actually able to search through all plans.  The dynamic programming bit just means that you don&#x27;t have to unnecessarily traverse all possible logic paths that a naive recursive algorithm might.  But if there is a good plan, it can be discovered.<p>It is unclear from the comment whether the algorithm can only find plans which involve adding one table at a time.  This would not be unreasonable - for example I know that Oracle circa a decade ago did that to avoid having to consider too many query plans on large joins.  I have no idea whether that ever got changed.<p>As to the parse tree, that seems like overkill to me.  You have a query.  It has a list of tables, and a list of join conditions.  A query plan includes tables, indexes, filters, and so on.  It could easily be augmented by stating which query condition was applied where.<p>To validate it you have to see that the lists of tables match, the list of applied conditions match, and each plan step could actually have the effect of doing that condition.  If it all ties out, it is a valid plan.  The fact that the plan might be crap is something that is explicitly left in the hands of the user - that&#x27;s the whole point of the feature.

The former is possible (x) and was preferable circa 1996, while the latter are afterthoughts bound to fail: you obviously can&#x27;t route true IPv6 on IPv4 hardware without upgrading it, and at that point, why not go dual-stack ?<p>Unlike a backwards compatible packet format, transition technologies require gateways to the &quot;new&quot; IPv6 Internet, that are checkpoints by definition and need configuration, resources and attack surface, amplifying the chicken and egg problem - why deploy gateways to the IPv6 when there&#x27;s nothing there ? Add flakiness of the transition technology itself, for example Teredo clients can&#x27;t even reach one other 25% of the time due to symmetric NATs.<p>(x) brain fart time:<p>If I were to redesign IPv6 today in a backwards compatible manner, I would treat the existing  NAT hierarchy as a set of different routing realms, and upgrade only these points to do a stateless forwarding of the extended packets, while keeping their existing behavior for regular IPv4 traffic.<p>For example, to reach host 10.10.10.10 siting behind NAT 2.2.2.2, an IPv4 packet is prepared with an extension field :<p>IP Header: DEST: 2.2.2.2<p>Extended Header: DEST: 10.10.10.10, REALM=0<p>(src omitted etc.)<p>The IPv4 infrastructure will forward the packet blindly while the upgraded NAT/router will recognize the extended format and instead of dropping it will mangle it and forward it along:<p>IP Header: DEST: 10.10.10.10<p>Extended Header: DEST: 2.2.2.2, REALM=1<p>The destination stack will establish a connection if it recognizes the packet format, or drop it if it&#x27;s a legacy IPv4 implementation.<p>You can repeat this for a bunch of chained NATs, incrementing the realm and swapping more routing bits from the Extended header into to the IP header, while reversing the mangling when extended packets exit from the inner routing realms. In an 128 bits address you could do this 4 times, sufficient even when dealing with something like &quot;NAT44444&quot;.<p>So you can keep end to end stateless routability as long as all NATs are cooperant, and fall back to regular IPv4 over NAT when they are not. In time, NATs will transform to routers, simply mangling and forwarding extended packets and do less and less state tracking for legacy packets, until eventually tracking can be turned off.<p>The idea is to upgrade only key edge infrastructure (NATs), to do a very simple and stateless transformation, and not the whole Internet with a risky and complex technology. NAT clients are incentivised to upgrade (for p2p, voip etc.) without finding themselves in an Internet ghetto with high latency and routing blackholes. It&#x27;s the same Internet with the same routes. In time, ISPs can release some of the massive SOHO IP space that&#x27;s no longer justified.<p>Maybe not an entirely thought out idea, but it&#x27;s a starting point. Or would have been. Despite it&#x27;s troubled childhood IPv6 is of course superior, allows easy renumbering and real multicast, etc.",1452212157

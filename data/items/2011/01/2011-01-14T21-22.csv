Likewise, being verbose is not a bad habit - it's an issue of style.<p>As for global state - using singletons is a design decision. If you don't like them, don't use them!<p>So many people on HN hate on Java just because they've made the switch to functional programming.  All power to you, but none of what's good about FP makes Java bad - it's just different.<p>I'd agree that there are some inherent design issues with Java - I've never liked primitives and I don't like how generics were implemented but other that that, it's a really excellent tool for a number of tasks.  Just because it doesn't look like what you like, doesn't make it bad (this reminds me of when Java came out in the first place and all the C++ programmers were saying that it was useless because it didn't have operator overloading. not bad, just different!)",1295042277

I've used both, and I've seen the results (and horror) of people doing the ""Teach yourself ASP.NET in 21 days"" version of ASP.NET, but really the stuff in those books isn't the stuff you should be using.<p>ASP.NET done right actually feels a lot more MVC than ASP.NET MVC.  You can still route whatever paths you want, but you get to use actual files where files make sense.  And you get to sanely base your pages on a common class, and you can manipulate properties on your HTML from the backend.  It's the best of both, really, since all the fun stuff from MVC got poured into ASP.NET too.<p>I still do MVC work for clients, but as of now, new project stuff where I'm spending my own time (and therefore money) still gets done in regular old ASP.NET.",1295042040

Where this jingoistic element came in, I'm not really sure.

Every Chinese mother I know (that would be quite a few) found the Amy Chua article to be repulsive. Just like the American moms did, except that they knew people would equate them with Chua's ideas so it makes them even angrier. My own wife (a Chinese mom) and her friends and relatives have been circulating the Chua article and talking about it and the consensus is a universal ""WTF is wrong with this woman?!""<p>Then you read that the Wall Street Journal article was, at least to a certain extent, not representative of the actual tone of the book and you realize that this piece, so disliked by real Chinese mothers is an exaggeration of the whole phenomenon.<p>People like the mom in this linked article are responding to an exaggeration of a caricature (and should be aware of this, though, from their own defensive and annoyed tone I suspect are not) and it strikes a chord because people are too sensitive to perceived criticism of things that matter deeply to their psyches... like the job they do raising their kids.<p>So the WSJ takes an extreme point of view, exaggerates it to fit a caricature of a certain racial stereotype, people get annoyed at this mostly made up thing and start reacting angrily and the WSJ and those  involved in the book make money off of the whole mess.

Browser support for TIFF is an inconsistent mess.<p>In the case of the img tag, the most common browsers all supported two common formats pretty well (JPEG and GIF), so those two formats became the de-facto baseline image formats organically.<p>I think the situation with video is similar.

A startup that I knew of was creating a product and service and they asked me to build an iPhone app in May '09. We discussed the requirements, and I signed an SOW that was for a defined set of requirements. I however, went above and beyond those requirements and built something that met those requirements but created a much better UI than the SOW asked for; thinking there would be some compensation for that at a later point. I just completed the app, and the hours i spent were 2X the hours stated in the SOW. I know, my fault but I believe in it. I enjoyed it. That SOW included a convertible note with a value of $7500. My max conversion rate is $4/share as stated in the note. The company's valuation per share was $0.74 in Oct 2010 based on a $150K investment; making the company worth $650K. There were 1M authorized shares, 911,250 outstanding, and 88,750 authorized but not issued.<p>Here are the options I've been given:  1) Convert my note at $2/share, create a second note with a value, conversion rate, and deliverables defined. 2) Convert my note at $2/share, and create a second ""contract"" that involves profit sharing from app downloads or products sold via the app. I feel that $2/share is very high.

7864383,comment,7858276,7861823,1,0,talex5,,,"> On the other hand, there are correct programs which we still don&#x27;t know how to type. This means that there are programs we just can&#x27;t write in statically typed languages, at least not yet.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right. If something can&#x27;t be type-checked then you just add an &quot;assert&quot; and do the check dynamically.<p>For example, in 0install I need to ask the SAT solver which version of a program I should use. I pass it a load of SAT variables, each containing a user data field with the attached program details, run the solver, and get back the selected variable. The SAT problem also contains other variables, with other kinds of data.<p>I <i>know</i> the user data field for the selected result will be of type program details, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to let the compiler check this statically. It&#x27;s not a problem; I just check the type and &quot;assert false&quot; if it&#x27;s wrong. I still get the benefit of static checking almost everywhere else in the code.",1402223695

7864374,comment,7862233,7862233,3,0,pdkl95,,,"StackOverflow - like many popular forums - is a place where a lot of <i>inexperienced</i> people end up spending their time. This is almost a tautology: &quot;pop-forums full people that act inexperienced&quot; end up that way because... inexperienced people end to flock towards popular sites full of like-minded people.<p>Given that most people will at least try to helpful, you end up with a lot of people re-distributing the bits of knowledge they&#x27;ve learned. This often starts as cargo-cult behavior, and - if left to grow in isolation - it can turn into groupthink[1].<p>It&#x27;s easy to jump to the conclusion that some form of moderation or judicial process is needed; if the greater resource is to be saved, the trolls/n00bs/&quot;children&quot; need to restrained so they can&#x27;t make a mess that pollutes the community. I think this approach fails to address the actual problem: that some people need a lot more <i>education</i> before they can progress past the &quot;inexperienced n00b&quot;/&quot;child&quot; stage.<p>The mechanics in place at StackOverflow - even with its flaws - can be a very useful tool. If enough people who <i>are</i> experienced (in technical or social areas) spent some time there regularly, the extra role models would help this greater social problem a lot. Answer the same n00b questions over and over is annoying, but that&#x27;s the kind of effort it takes to maintain a community across generations.<p>[1] Regardless of what you think of the language itself (or this well-known rant against it), the article &quot;PHP: a fractal of bad design&quot;[2] is a good case-study of what happens if that groupthink is left in isolation far too long.<p>[2] <a href=""http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/</a>",1402223353

The fact that you can patent most of these things in the first place is crazy; you didn&#x27;t do &#x27;real R&D&#x27; on these. You just had someone with patent knowledge identify as much patents as possible in a grand collection of things which might well have taken real R&D to come up with. But then you should be forced to patent the whole of things, not every trivial part in it. The infringers / trolls are the ones who sue over trivial stuff which a 4 year old can think up while sitting on the toilet. And that&#x27;s what most of these are. And most of the others (and a lot of these) are prior art. Making it sound official doesn&#x27;t change that.

Here’s why. Lucid dreaming was defined by higher scores in participants’ feelings of insight (knowing that they were dreaming); dissociation (taking a third person perspective); and control (being able to shape events). I looked up the paper where the researchers first described their scale for measuring these factors. If I understand correctly, the participants rated their experience of these three factors on a scale of 0 (strongly disagree that I had such an experience) to 5 (strongly agree). Now if we look to see the scores they gave for how much dream insight, dissociation and control they had, we find that the averages for the gamma stimulation condition are around 0.6, 1.3, and 0.5 respectively.</i>&quot;",1402222199

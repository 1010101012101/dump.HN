The biggest difference I see is that the Linux Kernel can be tweaked to specific performance characteristics at build time, whereas Windows can only be altered by runtime configuration. depending on what you might want to change, you may not have that capability.
Going back to the article about network latency while playing media, the breakdown seems to show that this was a bug, and bugs happen. To Linux's credit, those bugs are probably patched more quickly and even if it hasn't been promoted to release, if someone has made a patch, you can incorporate your own fix. If not, the landscape doesn't look any different for Linux vs. Windows in that regard.",1368237209

I'm good friends with several of the folks who are rebuilding it using Mesos at Twitter. They are all insanely awesome people.<p>Let's say you have a Rails stack (app server + DB) that you want to deploy for testing in 3 different datacenters. If that works out, you then immediately need to deploy 10,000 instances each to 10 different datacenters. Oh yeah, and the storage needs to be distributed and universally available, in case any of the servers crash. Performance testing reveals that you can't have more than 10 servers per rack, otherwise you saturate the rack switch. You also need to account for power distribution redundancy, shifting traffic loads, etc.<p>Oh, and you want to do this with a single configuration that's manageable by a team of 3-4 people and have deployment be entirely automated and monitored.<p>The complexities behind this problem are simply enormous, almost too much to even comprehend. I am proud of the work we did at Google to attempt (yes, attempt) to solve this problem, and I know my friends at Twitter are doing great work as well.

5689436,comment,5689107,5689107,43,0,grellas,,,"As noted in my analysis below (posted when the Federal Court agreed to hear this case <i>en banc</i>, a term explained below), this case is <i>not</i> about killing off software patents or other forms of business methods.<p>That said, it <i>is</i> very significant in that the Federal Circuit has elected not to go wildly back in the direction of upholding loose patents and in mitigating the damage that would have been caused by a potentially pernicious approach to upholding software patents that had been adopted by the panel whose decision it reviewed. The result is basically an uncertain hodge-podge that will not in itself work to kill off software patents.<p>To give some legal context to those who may be interested, my technical analysis from 7 months ago follows:<p>""1. The <i>CLS Bank v. Alice</i> case, though raising an issue of vital importance, is not about 'whether software is patentable.'<p>2. Over the years, the Federal Circuit has notoriously broadened the scope of patent eligibility, most conspicuously in its 1998 <i>State Street</i> decision which essentially opened the floodgates to the modern rush of business method patents by holding that virtually any business method was patentable so long as 'it produces a useful, concrete and tangible result.' In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the <i>Bilski</i> case, repudiated the <i>State Street</i> test for patent eligibility and, though upholding software and business method patents generally, directed courts to be much more vigilant to ensure that no one gain patent rights to what are mere 'abstract ideas,' however much they may incidentally be tied to some computer mechanism in their implementation. In a follow on decision (<i>Prometheus</i>), the U.S. Supreme Court similarly cut back sharply on the permissible scope of patent eligibility for claimed inventions that constituted nothing more than laws of nature.<p>3. In this <i>CLS Bank</i> case, the claimed patent involves a method for eliminating certain types of risk associated with an escrow closing and used a technological process by which to mimic a phantom version of the closing as a security check before allowing the real transaction to close. In essence, the technological aspect of this 'invention' is routine and so the question is whether anything beyond that is simply another way of trying to patent nothing more than an abstract idea. If so, it should fail under <i>Bilski</i>; if not, it would potentially pass the test for patent eligibility.<p>4. The lower court in <i>CLS Bank</i> held as a matter of law that the 'invention' was nothing more than an abstract idea and held it invalid as being ineligible for patent protection. On appeal, a divided panel of the Federal Circuit reversed and reinstated the patent. It did so, however, by setting out a brand new procedural rule whose effect would be to gut much of <i>Bilski</i> and reopen the floodgates to huge numbers of business method patents under a very loose standard - to wit, by holding, that, if it 'is not manifestly evident [my emphasis] that a claim is directed to a patent ineligible abstract idea,' then the court essentially treat the claim as eligible. What the Federal Circuit panel did, then, was to take the Supreme Court's directive for lower courts to be much stricter in evaluating dubious business method patents for patent eligibility and recast that directive in a form that said, if you as a court see that something is obviously nothing more than an abstract idea, then go ahead and reject it but you are otherwise to treat as being eligible for patent protection. In other words, the new strictness found in <i>Bilski</i> for evaluating such claims was once again to be transformed by the Federal Circuit into a loose standard that would let such claims coast by unimpeded.<p>5. Of course, this has set off alarm bells because, in effect, it represents yet one more revolt by the Federal Circuit against attempts by the Supreme Court to rein it in by bringing patent issues back to some semi-sane state. Following the panel decision (which was rendered over a sharp and stinging dissent), the losing party petitioned for a rehearing en banc (meaning by the full panoply of Federal Circuit judges as opposed to merely a 3-judge panel) and this was granted. Thus, we shall see whether the Federal Circuit is prepared once again to stick its thumb in the eye of the Supreme Court or whether it will temper its extreme pro-patent proclivities and follow the law as it has been directed.<p>So, this is a very important case affecting the trend of patent enforcement in a profound way but does nothing to challenge the idea of software or business methods being patentable in a general sense. For anything to change in that regard, Congress must act.""",1368236679

It crashes all the time. Furthermore, the application's needs themselves change all the time, depending on traffic curves and processing needs.

If you are a Junior developer (or aiming at being one) Haskell is a language you most definitely don't need.<p>Now, once you have your feet wet, it's worth learning. Here's why:<p>- Pure(mostly) functional language. This is in opposition to  Java & Ruby, which while having functional aspects are OO (Object Oriented).
- It's okay not to know what a functional language is. It's making functions first-class citizens, such that a function becomes a value like any other.
- Separates IO from computation. IO is inherently impure and unreliable, so functions are generally pure and instead wrap IO in containers. Obviously, programs would be less useful (still use in the compiler running!) without IO.
- All of these concepts (and more) will change how you think about programming and make you a better programmer in all languages.<p>Haskell can be found in some backend stacks, the more notable examples I can think of are Mailrank (acquihired by Facebook) and Bump.<p>Personally, I've only done a limited number of projects with Haskell (a Postgres-backed beer API & IRC bot) but I've grown to respect it as a language and through limited exposure has made me love FP.",1368235856

6688208,comment,6686688,6687301,1,0,touristtam,,,"hardly a surprise there: over hyped franchise since the version you have mentioned. The direction the franchise took past the first one has been a let down for anyone following the team behind MoH:AA: shinier graphics, removal of dedicated server and modding tools, same old game modes (apart from Base Assault in CoD:UO and the re-hash of zombie survival in CoD:WaW), leveling system to unlock part of the game (since CoD4).<p>When DICE started to include destructible environment in BattleField, CoD was trying to convince that their static and confined environment was doing a better job. Obviously their target demographic doesn&#x27;t have the memory to remember (or choose to ignore) the previous iteration.<p>It is fair to mention the discord between the owner of the company and the ex studio lead regarding the future of Activision: When you have this kind of climate existing in a company, it should be a good indicator of the product development.<p>All in all, I would say this is hardly news worthy, even more so on HN (sorry if it sounds harsh).",1383810939

6688201,comment,6666149,6667555,1,0,yason,,,"I basically know how it works, that was just my interpretation of the scheme and I stick to it. But I think I used the term mining in an unorthodox way.<p>What I meant by mining is getting reward coins from doing the number-crunching required to find good hashes for blocks. I think the current semantics is that mining means doing that hash-finding number-crunching but it&#x27;s also being used to refer to mining <i>bitcoins</i> which is maybe a bit misleading.<p>Thus, I rephrase my statement: I maintain that <i>bitcoin rewards</i> themselves aren&#x27;t necessary  the rewards are just an incentive and indeed a convenient way to distribute bitcoins in a rather stable way.<p>When we hit the 21 million mark and have no new bitcoins left, the number-crunching part would still have to continue. This is no problem because of transaction fees will provide a sufficient incentive for that. And this brings us back to my point that theoretically we <i>could&#x27;ve started with</i> just that.<p>Theoretically, we could&#x27;ve started with distributing 21 million bitcoins to 21 million random people and let the peer-to-peer network start with doing only transaction verification, and incentivize that with transaction fees. (Probably wouldn&#x27;t have worked in reality but that&#x27;s only because of the human factor.)<p>That&#x27;s what I meant.",1383810758

According to Wikipedia, &quot;In 2011, the NBA was composed of 83 percent non-white players, including 78 percent black, four percent Latino, and one percent Asian; 17 percent of the players were white.&quot; [1] Furthermore, a 1999 analysis of the top 150 NBA point scorers found that 135 (90%) were Black and 15 (10%) were White. Given that 78% of the US is white and 13% of the US is black, Blacks are substantially over-represented in the NBA. The author also estimated that in order to explain this effect, the mean &quot;athletic quotient&quot; of Blacks must be about 0.87 standard deviations higher than the mean &quot;athletic quotient&quot; of Whites. Furthermore, this athletic superiority is also found in other sports. [2] Very interesting read, if you&#x27;re reading this far I suggest you look through it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_NBA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_NBA</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/blackathlete.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/blackathlete.htm</a>",1383809633

Alternatively there is a nice area of Queens (?) that is predominately white but has good schools. Now all it takes is a preference  or a feeling of being more comfortable near grandma and near other young mothers &quot;just like me&quot;.<p>Since grandma will likely be living in an area where there was traditionally a larger percentage of black families the <i>comfortable</i> preference is near grandma.  and who would argue with an expectant mother wanting to be comfortable.<p>At a certain point the cost of being near grandma will exceed the amount they can afford without realising they are making an explicit racist choice.  which is I think my preferred definition - not emotional preference but when a conscious decision is made with race as a factor.<p>All this shakes out to mean that levels of preference few if any of us would consider racist, lead to segregated neighbourhoods.  luckily other preferences intrude masking the effect.<p>So to help with the discussion, this implies that if everyone was perfectly color blind we would expect to see a 81% ratio.  if not what is the level, the error bar, that we accept as emotional preference that does not cross the line ?<p>And how do we tell that difference if the starting population is not 81% in that area ? and if the school district in the area is really bad / good?

Transfer 1 bitcoin from Wallet i to Wallet i+1

I run Wallet B, that takes transactions from many people.
You give me the 50BTC that is stolen. I send you 50 bitcoins in small increments randomly over a set period of time, but from the other transactions I have.

You can&#x27;t just write some gibberish on a piece of paper, you must communicate using the proper syntax, and learn to call things by their unique names (nobody&#x27;s going to take you seriously if you make some ambiguous statements).<p>Once you learn the drill, though, it&#x27;s fantastic. You can find ANYTHING you want there, as long as you know how to navigate it. No need to ask anything to anyone, no need to learn a bunch of different ways to say the same things (it&#x27;s so annoying when that other astronomy kid use different terms to describe the same thing as the first guy I told you about). I used to be limited by what individual people I met wanted to talk about. With that board, there&#x27;s no such limit. I can communicate anything, get there the next day and see an answer.<p>&quot;The only limit is yourself&quot; - Zombo.com<p>Conclusion:<p>The web 2.5 (API web) is limited by what the service let you do. You want to do something that is outside the scope of that particular service? Too bad, you gotta create your own company and ultimately face failure.<p>These services are too rigid (lack flexibility), they&#x27;re opinionated and non-standard (you have to learn every service all over again, 10 extremely similar services will have totally different APIs and ways to call and model things), and ultimately, you have to level-down your solution based on the limitations of the service. It&#x27;s not a proper way to live.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s nice and all that we agreed to all communicate using voice and ears, but we still all speak different languages, and having to learn the language of anyone I want to talk to is painful.<p>We must unify semantics, not just the medium (JSON/XML). Over are the days where you model your classes yourself.",1383808697

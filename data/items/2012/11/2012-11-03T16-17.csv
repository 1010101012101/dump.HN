This is beneficial because you can change part of it and not have to have google re-crawl everything, since index updates happen right after a whole sitemap has been crawled. As a result, changes you make to a smaller sitemap get indexed way faster.<p>I've switched to grouping my bulk pages into sitemaps alphabetically, and then putting important ones (front page, about) into different sitemaps, and specific landing pages into yet another different one.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemap_index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemap_index</a>",1351961997

Its making me a small bit of money, and I'd like to expand the feature set and go after a higher-margin type of customer.<p>My first problem is that I expect to log a crapload of events from my distributed set of tools that drive the revenue stream of the business. As such, the solution should be scalable without breaking the bank.<p>My second problem is that I need to report aggregate statistics from within the app (and within any other app I build in the future).<p>My third problem is that I don't want to build it myself. I'd rather be an expert at my own analytics platform than try to become an expert at Google's.<p>So, would you build the analytics system as a plugin to each app that needs it, thereby consuming the dynos and resources of the app (which may impact user experience if the dynos aren't enough and spike at times), or would you build it separately (isolated) and use APIs to move data between your analytics collection/data crunching app. Or maybe let your core app connect to the analytics app's database directly to pull data when needed?<p>I would love any answer you could muster. Also if any of you have ANY experience at this and would be willing to chat by phone, I'd be in your debt and would return the favor many times over when I get this business up and running. My email is in my profile, else I would love to hear your answer here in the comments.<p>Also, if you want to know more about how we run our business and how we got to profitability by bootstrapping, I will spill any details you would like to know about.<p>Thank you!",1351961966
4737118,comment,4736779,4736779,8,0,experiment0,,,"I used to be an Apple store employee in the Family room (where the devices get fixed). In fact I used to work as the exact employee who mainly checked people in for their appointment. The store I worked in had an extremely high volume of people coming in for repairs. Our store policy was, if the person had missed their entire appointment (E.g. 15 minutes late for mac appointments and 10 minutes late for mobile) then they would be turned away, except for in exceptional circumstances (multiple repairs etc).<p>We reserved some appointments each day for ""walk-ins"" and these became available every hour, however they were immediately snapped up within 5 minutes of become available.<p>My point is that, this is a reservation, much like an eye checkup or dentist appointment. If you miss your reservation, that is your responsibility and not ours to try and fit you in. The booking process is explicit in reminding you not to be late.<p>If the OP genuinely did get turned away for being 5 minutes late, then that is quite harsh, however I think its more likely that he missed his allotted appointment time and in that case it is 100% his fault for not making it. And oh yeah bringing up the Steve Jobs point is so irrelevant and is just hyperbole.<p>The recall itself is another matter which IS Apple's responsibility and probably should have been handled better.",1351961959

4737098,comment,4735633,4736212,2,0,AlexMennen,,,"> One last point, as much as people focus on key states deciding the election, the reality is that the states are on a spectrum based on the popular vote. If a Republican wins the popular vote by 8% or more they'll probably carry California, otherwise they won't. A Democrat will have to win by 5-8% to carry Texas. When the popular vote is close, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Wisconsin are in play. Were it not close they wouldn't be.<p>It is always the states near the middle that matter. This is because if you are going to lose the election anyway, losing by a smaller electoral college margin doesn't help, and conversely, if you are going to win anyway, winning by a larger electoral college margin doesn't help. Candidates campaign to maximize the probability that they reach 270 electoral votes. That is why Obama and Romney are campaigning a more in Ohio than they are in Florida even though the polls are closer in Florida than they are in Ohio. Florida is a toss-up, but if Obama wins Florida, he probably also wins enough slightly bluer states like Ohio to win without Florida.<p>Also, California or Texas flipping would require an absolutely massive popular vote landslide. Probably at least a 15% margin.",1351961770

Here it is:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4736105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4736105</a><p>This --and the statement you refer to and mangle-- has nothing to do with me (or proponents of an alternative approach) getting their way.  You almost make it sound like a childish whine to which I take offense.<p>This is about having fair and intelligent elections.  Elections today feel like you are watching five-year-olds blame each other for who broke Mom's flowers.  It's idiotic at best.<p>Candidates should not be allowed to engage in stupidity.  Talk about your platform, ideas and approach.  Leave the other guys alone.  Let me decide based on who you are and what you say you are going to do.<p>This is also about making it possible for anyone to run for office.  I said in another reply that someone like Stephen Hawking has zero chance to run for office today.  In this media-driven election system we seem to have looking good, speaking well, being able to crack a joke, sing and dance seems to be a requirement.  Do you know how many super-smart people have the personality of a brick?  Maybe not that extreme, but I hope you get the point.<p>And, how about money.  If you don't have or can't raise a billion dollars, forget it.  Again, tons of incredibly gifted people don't stand a chance.  They wouldn't even get off the line.  That is wrong.<p>The electoral college also means that Independent candidates have an almost zero chance of winning the presidential election.  Zero.  States like California have a significant number of independent voters.  I was talking to one the other day and he said something akin to ""My vote really doesn't count.  In order to feel like it counts I have to choose to vote for either a Republican or Democratic candidate."".  How fair is that system.<p>A popular vote, devoid of state lines and with rules aimed at reducing the bullshit factor would allow the very real possibility of having more than two choices.  It should allow almost anyone to run and be heard.<p>There's no reason why it couldn't start on a website where candidates --hundreds of them, thousands of them-- stated their platform and start being filtered two years in advance of the election.  Don't have a computer?  Want to participate in the process?  Go to a library and use on of the computers there.  I find it funny to note that some of these purportedly disenfranchised voters are walking around with iPhones, driving SUV's and watching satellite television on their 50 inch LCD TV's.<p>I agree with you on the point about mandatory voting.  I lived in Argentina for a number of years and watched how mandatory voting is twisted and turned there for candidates' benefits.  They'd literally buy votes through all sorts of giveaways. What's worst is that the people being manipulated are the poor and uneducated.  The ugly truth is that they just follow the carrot.<p>The opposite of this is that absolute morons are allowed to vote in either system.  Voluntary voting does not guarantee that informed people will vote any more than it guarantees that votes are not being bought.  I've had conversations with people who absolutely floored me.  One guy was in absolute awe of the government because, as he put it, ""they are so smart that they can predict eclipses and shit like that.  Anybody that can do that is incredible"".  Another person, who happens to be the daughter of a friend of mine who has a PhD in Physics didn't understand and couldn't get her head around what the national debt means to her.  She obviously didn't follow in her fathers footsteps, at least in the math department.<p>How do you fix this?  I don't know.  I know it isn't popular to say that not everyone should vote.  If people are required to pass a test to obtain a driver's license, why shouldn't they be required to pass a test every year in order to be able to vote?  They can actually kill more people with their vote than by not knowing how to drive a car.  Not so?  How about the religious morons who vote across hard religious beliefs and against issues of health, science and progress that could save millions of lives?  Before anyone goes off for this comment, I am not a Democrat or Republican.  I hate aspects of both parties and like aspects of both.<p>The electoral college is just not good any more.

4736921,comment,4736736,4736736,77,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"This is a very polite interpretation of (some) traditional journalists' dislike for Mr Silver. It offers a consistent explanation for the dislike and vitriol, but there is another explanation to explore. Silver presents a method of investigation that is not only epistemologically different from traditional punditry, but threatening to it, and their dislike is centered on the threat his method poses, not just its intellectual merits or misunderstanding thereof. There are plenty of things for journalists to intellectually object to - why focus their efforts here?<p>Consider that Mr Silver has been given awards and accolades most journalists would kill for: Time's list of 100 most influential people in the world, best political blog Webby award, Rolling Stone's 100 agents of change, the editor in chief of Politico listed him as ""one of the most powerful people on earth"", he's given a prestigious lecture at Columbia Journalism School, etc. He's received accolades, even from traditional journalism sources, that most journalists, even at the NYTimes, would never dream of. Speaking of which, the Public Editor of the Times wrote ""hes probably (and please know that I use the p-word loosely) its most high-profile writer at this particular moment.""<p>All this for someone who has never worked a proper newsroom since college, never had a television show, cable or otherwise, and just started a blog four years ago because he was (supposedly) annoyed at laws that threatened his livelihood - online poker.<p>So imagine seeing someone like this receiving all the awards you've coveted since you started journalism in earnest. While the recoil against Mr Silver might be clothed in intellectual differences for some, the reason they care probably has more to do with seeing someone who differs from their traditional approach getting so much recognition.<p>Finally, I'd note that there are many traditional journalists who support Mr Silver's approach - his awards from traditional journalist organizations speak to this.

In this case, you CAN'T buy a bar in one place and sell in the other place at the same time, because you need time&money to transfer the metal. So you go long in one place, go short in the other place, and then wait for the prices to converge WITHOUT trying to move physical gold around, and do the reverse transactions. There is no real price risk here (if the prices never converge, you CAN move the gold bar around for a small cost), but there's a lot of procedural and counter party risk.<p>There's what's known as ""stat arb"" (statistical arbitrage), which is all statistics and no arbitrage; Let's say Gold and Silver tend to both move together (when Gold moves up or down by 1%, silver tends to move in the same direction by 1%). Now, you see Gold moved up 2%, but silver hasn't. You assume either gold will move down 2% back to silver, or silver will move up 2% to match gold, or gold will move down 1% and silver up 1%. The way to take advantage of that is to sell gold for an amount $X, buy $X of silver, and wait. Whatever scenario happens, your balance (when you sell your silver and buy back the gold), you will make money. Unless ... gold and silver stay divergent, which can happen. In which case, you'll lose money.<p>Thanks to financial wizardry, you can very often sell things you don't own, and ""buy them back"" later to make things whole again.<p>(And finally, there's something known as ""risk arbitrage"" - it is all risk, no arbitrage, but it sounds like you're not just gambling if you call it ""risk arbitrage"")",1351958816

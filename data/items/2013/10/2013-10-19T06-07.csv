I don&#x27;t see any reason not to support CORS; all the OpenStack requests require a custom Auth http header anyway, so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any danger in turning on CORS there.

6575606,comment,6571844,6575278,3,0,einhverfr,,,"> Postgres is growing delusions of grandeur for being an applications programming language, too.<p>PostgreSQL has had an extraordinarily extensible dialect of SQL since they moved from Quel in 1995.  This is because the db was designed so you can plug whatever programming languages you want into the back end.<p>For example, if you have a database of images tagged with location data, and you want to make it so you can run an SQL query that gives you all images matching a photo recognition algorithm for spotting sunsets within 20 miles of Sacramento California, you can build in the spacial and image recognition functions into the database and you can tune it so that the least expensive filters are run first, so that the image recognition algorithm outputs are indexed, and all kinds of other things.<p>Since it was founded in the 1980&#x27;s, PostgreSQL has been aimed at those sorts of problems.<p>> It&#x27;s not really any different of code, though.<p>Yes and no.  On one hand, you are right.  It is all code.<p>On the other hand, what it gives you is an ability to write code that can work in a set-based paradigm, and be subject to the various optimizations that PostgreSQL can give you in that regard.  And because inside such extensions you have no transaction control, there are hard limits to what one should do or try to do inside the database.<p>For example, some people decide they want to send emails out of the database back-end MS SQL-style.  This is a bad idea because it necessitates mixing transactional and non-transactional code in dangerous ways.  You can, however, raise a message on commit and have another process process it, and handle transactions accordingly.<p>TL;DR:  PostgreSQL has always been a development platform, and a very good one, but one which is also quite limited in what kinds of problems you can solve with it.",1382165555
6575605,comment,6574005,6575076,3,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"He&#x27;s actually completely wrong. Persistence is about image quality, and can be mitigated by filtering that hardcore gamers always turn off, because it costs them latency.<p>Reducing latency isn&#x27;t about how noticeable it is. Latency can be completely impossible to detect for you but still hurt you.<p>Input lag is the time between providing some input, such as clicking with your mouse, to getting feedback of this event on the screen. As the clicking will be prompted by things happening on the screen, input lag acts as a command delay to everything that is done. The most interesting feature of latency is that <i>all latency is additive</i>. It doesn&#x27;t matter how fast or slow each part in the system is, none of them can hide latency for one another. Or, even if the game simulation adds 150ms and your stupid wireless mouse adds 15ms, the 2 ms added by the screen still matter just as much.<p>The second mental leap is that the human controlling the system can also be considered to be just another part in the pipeline adding latency. Consider a twitch shooter, where two players suddenly appear on each other&#x27;s screens. Who wins depends on who first detects the other guy, successfully aims at him, and pulls the trigger. In essence, it&#x27;s a contest between the total latency (simulation/cpu + gpu + screen + person + mouse + simulation) of one player against the other player. Since all top tier human players have latencies really close to one another, even minute differences, 2 ms here or there, produce real detectable effects.",1382165530

I moved to the Bay Area not too long ago (3 years) for work and IMO it&#x27;s no comparison.<p>Miami is a great place to live if your priorities are partying. There are excellent night clubs and beautiful men and women everywhere.<p>The Bay Area holds an advantage over almost every point the OP made.<p>Rent is ~$2k for a 2 bedroom 2 bath if you want to live in a nice area in Coral Gables that isn&#x27;t full of roaches, or was built in the 1940s and has dwarf-sized rooms. Rent is about the same in the peninsula. If you want to purchase it&#x27;s a whole different story however. What costs ~$1m here is ~$300k there and probably in a lot better shape.<p>Food is a push. I must say the Bay Area probably offers a larger variety of food. Miami is mostly all Caribbean and Central/South American food which is excellent but not as varied as the Indian, Mediterranean, Afghan, Thai you see out here.<p>The neighborhoods are even more awesome here in the Bay Area. I say this because the strangers I meet on the street are a lot nicer than the strangers in Miami. There&#x27;s a unique, wonderful, and rich history to the cities and towns in the Bay Area and there are a lot of neat places to explore like the Open Space preserves out West or the forrest in Santa Cruz. The only mountains in Florida are the smelly trash ones.<p>The Developer ecosystem pales in comparison. It&#x27;s not even close and it won&#x27;t be for a while. There are very little tech companies out there and no real major players. While it&#x27;s very nice to see it blooming the reality is that it&#x27;s still in its infancy and if you&#x27;re moving out there just for the tech you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>The weather. It&#x27;s just terrible. It&#x27;s like a sauna all the time. It feels like you&#x27;re breathing in liquid water sometimes and it&#x27;s difficult to make it from your house to your car (which will be a scorching inferno) without sweating.<p>The only great things Miami has that I truly miss is the water; it is beautiful and warm.",1382165103

They are calculated by drawing a bunch of triangles all over the image to represent 3D geometry. Triangles are often drawn on top of other triangles. Many modern games also use multipass rendering to achieve certain lighting and special effects. Only after a whole image is computed can it be transferred to the monitor if you want the image to make sense. If you stop rendering half way through, the end result would be objects full of holes with entire features missing or distorted.

Personally I wouldn&#x27;t even care about bills very far into the past if we were only capturing this sort of schema for forward-looking data so it can be useful in the future.<p>I wonder what Taubere / Govtrack.us thinks about that sort of information and how it can be organized. I&#x27;m sure he has ideas about it and could give insight. Obviously any analysis beyond yae/nay records has an inherent partisanship, if even slight, which I assume is part of the reason isn&#x27;t on Govtrack, but he has to have thought about how those kind of data fit to the govtrack schema.",1382163874

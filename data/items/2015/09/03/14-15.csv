The idea is that instead of listing existing places, the site shows you what you can do for a given budget (e.g Enjoy the view from the highest mountain in Berlin for 0€). I also want it to be 100% user curated. It’s currently limited to Berlin, so i’m looking for feedback from travel experts on this project. My idea is not to create the next tripadvisor, instead i want to partner with travel blogs to have a smaller expert curated selection of things to do. What do you guys think?",1441292327

I&#x27;m always pause a little when someone supplies an unflattering ulterior reason for a criticism (&quot;oh, they&#x27;re just pissed that they didn&#x27;t get in&quot;), since there may in fact be reasonable criticisms of google&#x27;s interviewing process that shouldn&#x27;t be dismissed so casually.<p>However, as someone who went through it recently (software engineer position, didn&#x27;t get an offer), I agree with you that it is straightforward, no gotchas or gimmicks.  I&#x27;d say that at least in my case, if you review data structures and algorithms, and are prepared to use them creatively to answer middle-to-difficult style questions from &quot;cracking the coding interview&quot; (not the exact questions, of course, but at that level of difficulty), at a whiteboard, in 45 minutes, without too much help, then yes, you&#x27;re prepped.  I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;ll pass the exams, I&#x27;m just saying you won&#x27;t be surprised (again, just in my own experience, for a SE position).<p>The only thing I was &quot;surprised&quot; with is just how much progress you really are expected to make on these problems and the level of accuracy you are expected to show in your coding.  I gave myself three weeks to prepare.  I should have taken 3 months, maybe more.  No, every parenthesis or semicolon doesn&#x27;t need to be placed correctly, but (again, my impression here) you pretty much do need to be writing code (probably in Java or C++) that will compile and run with minor edits, and you need to largely solve the problem, at a whiteboard, in 45 minutes.  If you get stumped a bit and need a prompt, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll rule you out, but if you need too much help getting through, my guess (based on limited experience) is that this will be a no-hire.<p>Fair enough.  I think there&#x27;s room for reasonable disagreement about whether this sort of thing produces too high a &quot;false negative&quot; rate, but I suppose that&#x27;s up to Google.  Good software developers are hard to find, and while false negatives do cost you, false positives cost you too.  I&#x27;d generally say this is google&#x27;s business, they can afford to be picky, as you said.<p>With one difference… which is that Silicon valley companies almost uniformly insist that there is a severe shortage of software engineers, yet at the same time insist on being (this may just be my own opinion), <i>extremely</i> picky about who they hire.  Should an industry that by its own admission tolerates an exceptionally high false negative rate be taken seriously when it says it has trouble attracting enough talent?",1441292151

So we may very well never see this regulation brought up or passed given the current, money-greased machinations of the political machine.<p>That isn&#x27;t the actual problem. Its the problem the author imagines.<p>The real problem with land [and property taxes] is the fact it tends to flow into the cost of rent and homeownership. Everyone in this country is impacted, it is just a question of degree. Similarly, the vast majority sees an item in their basket of purchases goes up by $X and gets angry.<p>Case in point: The gasoline tax. The vast majority of economists thinks it should go up to cover infrastructure but there is no political will to do so precisely because of how angry it makes their constituents.<p>People are far less rational than you think they are and if their entire tax burden was shifted into the rent for their house, they&#x27;d flip the fuck out.",1441291980

The signs show the way.<p>I assume that’s the case, since that is the only explanation that does make sense given the design – with the red stripes – and the consistent placement of the signs. The station has two other obvious exits – the two air locks – but those wouldn’t be used in case of an emergency and don’t need signage throughout the station showing you the way there.<p>There is an exit sign right next to the US airlock, but that could also just be there to tell you to turn left when you exit the airlock to get to the docked Soyuz: <a href=""http://imgur.com/8UJP11Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/8UJP11Y</a><p>If you look around you can see that the red stripe design is used throughout the station to show you where things are you would need in an emergency, like “Portable Breathing Apparatus”, “Fire Extinguisher” and “Fire Port” (all for use during fires). There are also some signs with red stripes that have different directional arrows and pictograms on them. Oh, I just zoomed in on those and look what I found: <a href=""http://imgur.com/3Qyl3bE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/3Qyl3bE</a><p>That’s your definite answer! The pictograms are an elaboration on the Exit signs, showing you the directions in which you can find the Shuttle and Soyuz. Obviously, that Shuttle pictogram – it was always docked at the other end of the station – is kinda outdated by now. They can hopefully put some nice Dragon/CST-100 stickers on there soon.<p>It seems they use red/white stripes to indicate emergency routes and equipment and yellow/black stripes for warnings and caution signs. Blue signs to show you where up and own, backward and forward, left and right is. As the station is always in free fall that’s obviously arbitrary, but consistently defining those directions in some way obviously also helps with orientation (and, I would assume, communication between everyone working up there and those on the ground communicating with the station). Look for the OVHD, FWD, AFT, DECK and so on signs around the hatches. Also, look at the hatch where you enter the Russian sector (directly beyond that and down are the Soyuz). You can see many round glow-in-dark patches around the hatch, obviously also used to show you the way to a Soyuz ship, especially if, say, power and lights are out.<p>By the way, look what I found: <a href=""http://imgur.com/Elwl8Rf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/Elwl8Rf</a><p>It seems someone moved the equipment for some reason and patched over the emergency sign, adding a handwritten note with the place the equipment was moved to.<p>I know that they <i>do</i> have a printer on board but, eh, I guess a handwritten note will do.

I&#x27;m currently a CTO/CIO in a niche industry, although I write code almost daily and participate in various technical trenches many CIOs wouldn&#x27;t venture into on a daily basis due to lack of resources.<p>I am sadly terrified of getting older. Not because I fear death (well, maybe a little), but I fear the silver ceiling this industry seems to place on many. Sure, the CIO/CTO thing might help, but I&#x27;m not banking on it. I&#x27;ve seen so many qualified folks get replaced by younger, unqualified ones just because of the way IT tends to favor the young.<p>Now I look at my own daughter, who is very interested in following in my footsteps and is already programming and Lego mindstorm&#x27;ing, and I really, sincerely hesitate to push her in that direction. I love the craft and think it&#x27;s very personally rewarding as a creative outlet, but not only is there this silver ceiling, but to stay current you are <i>constantly</i> required to be learning. I spend  almost all my spare time working to stay current. I see friends who are lawyers or accountants, and while I would probably die of boredom in either field, there seems to be nowhere near the level of effort to stay current in those fields.<p>While I don&#x27;t think the constant learning requirement has a solution, I really hope to get some time in the future thinking deeply about the silver ceiling problem. Not just for me, but for my tech friends. I personally employee two 60+ folks on my team, and they&#x27;re great resources. I wish other companies would view them in this way. It seems there is something which could be done...even if it&#x27;s a company which distinguishes itself by making a point of hiring senior, aging folks for solving problems which require that level of experience. However, that of course has it&#x27;s own difficult problems to solve (namely, a senior employee likely has a lot of his/her own personal overhead to cover, so salary requirements will be understandably greater). Still, if the problems were out there, perhaps a company like that could thrive. Perhaps.<p>Anyway, just the ramblings of a early forties techie who thinks/worries a lot about this.

Does the site help the companies make a good decision after these 3 days or is just a sourcing channel?<p>3. After noticing that the jobs aren&#x27;t dev only: Great! So many job sites are focused on devs exclusively :)<p>4. After clicking &quot;Start trial&quot; link: Why do you want me to sign-in? I didn&#x27;t notice this requirement earlier. Why Twitter? Why don&#x27;t you provide some form instead?<p>5. After attempting to sign in with Twitter: Why do you need so many permissions? Update my profile? Post Tweets for me? Can I trust you?<p>6. After abandoning the sign-in and going back to home page: Aaaah there&#x27;s &quot;Pleas sign-in message at the top&quot;. It seems I was banner blind 2 minutes ago. So where is the FAQ, contact info, TOS and other stuff required to form at least basic level of trust?<p>So, as in case of many services it was a little emotional roller-coaster between hope, disillusionment and doubt coming form insufficient information. Fortunately all of these seem to be quite easy to fix :)<p>EDIT: A couple more of questions running through my head during the 1st experience with your site:<p>1. How will the trial look like?

First, there are specialties. Years ago, you could be a generalist, and be useful writing software pretty much anywhere. And I&#x27;m not talking about just learning the latest fad language or framework. If you don&#x27;t have a long background in neural nets, or transaction processing, or compilers, or you name it, you aren&#x27;t going to be doing work that is <i>both</i> useful and interesting.<p>Second, as the author says, programming these days is often just taking libraries, writing adapters, all to serve slightly more relevant ads slightly faster. What a huge fucking waste of time. After the 2008 financial meltdown, it was noted that the &quot;best and brightest&quot; young people were wasting their talents on the &quot;financialization&quot; of the economy, which did nothing good for nearly everyone. I see the same thing happening now, in software.<p>Third, like the author, I got tired of working for idiots and wasting my time on corporate voodoo, so I left for consulting.

Don&#x27;t &quot;stay&quot; just because you&#x27;re comfortable, particularly if you know, deep-down, you&#x27;re not doing anything worthy or you hate it;<p>1.a.1) Even if you stay, move - sooner rather than later - if you suspect you should&#x27;ve already been promoted or &quot;grown&quot; inside the company. I&#x27;d say that, if you&#x27;re not promoted or adequately appreciated within 3-5 years, chances are you won&#x27;t be, at all. You&#x27;ll deeply regret the years lost at that company, particularly if you&#x27;re not fond of the business;<p>2) Overtime is a an exception. I repeat, exception. No money will ever pay the time you wasted in OT, particularly if it was for a company you don&#x27;t like or a product you don&#x27;t believe in;<p>3) A company funded PhD is a lovely idea if you&#x27;re in love with the company. If you&#x27;re not, or if you have any kind of bad feelings about it, &quot;run&quot;. It&#x27;s a very long term commitment, and the company will make you pay if you leave.

I understand that they&#x27;re the Economist so they can&#x27;t outright say that the rich are hurting the economy by hurting the poor, but come on, at least be a little more clear.<p>I don&#x27;t know, the article seems to be rather clear on the matter:<p>> <i>If regulatory limits on building heights and density were relaxed, fewer plots of land would be needed to satisfy a given level of demand. That would reduce the rents collected by landowners, since any uptick in demand could quickly be met by new development. Just as soaring agricultural productivity led to a decline in the relative economic power of rural landowners in the 19th and 20th centuries, the relaxation of strict limits on development would lead to a decline in property wealth relative to the economy as a whole. </i><i>More of the gains of economic activity would flow to workers and investors.</i> <i></i>",1441289554

10164991,comment,10162295,10163556,0,0,grayrest,,,"I&#x27;ve thought about why widget libraries don&#x27;t work on the web since 2008. In 2007 I was making iOS webapps, in 2008 Apple put out the SDK and the native apps were better. I decided that the native apps were better because the devs didn&#x27;t blow 60% of their time budget building a poor, custom widget library. The problems I&#x27;ve encountered:<p>The first and most basic is that the expectation on the web is that every project will have a unique look and feel. This greatly limits the adoption of frameworks based on desktop widget library concepts (dojo, ext, sencha, cappuccino, sproutcore). The times I&#x27;ve used these frameworks, I spend as much time fighting the look and feel as I would building an interface from scratch. This isn&#x27;t a problem if you&#x27;re look and feel insensitive and desktop style widget libraries do get picked up for internal corporate apps.<p>The second problem is size. The need to download everything, desire for reduced page load times, and lack of dead code elimination has historically made web devs more sensitive to the size of their libraries. This was a problem for libraries like YUI2, which had excellent components that simply had an option for anything somebody at yahoo wanted but adding a new widget would frequently add hundreds of K to the download. This is a reduced concern with the increased capabilities of mobile and I believe that the combination of HTTP2, having a standard module system, increased tooling (e.g. webpack), universal/isomorphic JS, and ServiceWorker provide the means to more or less eliminate this as a core problem.<p>The third problem is CSS. The language provides no tools for abstraction when the target markup (your widget) is fixed. Happily, this problem is solved via sass. You can separate style concerns into mixins (or placeholders) and compose them into either widget or instance specific rules and avoid the cascade.<p>The fourth problem is component composition. In order to get more code reuse, you need to be able to build up bigger widgets from small pieces and then make a lot of useful small pieces. Stateful components don&#x27;t compose particularly well and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on this (in yui3, knockout, and angular) before I found React&#x27;s virtual dom approach two years ago. With the vdom, it&#x27;s possible to view components as functions projecting state onto a virutal DOM. Composition can then be solved by creating higher order components and using normal functional programming composition and code reuse. With care put in to how larger components are designed, it&#x27;s possible (I&#x27;ve done it) to swap out sub components to customize behavior on a per-instance basis. I consider the core problem solved but I haven&#x27;t seen the equivalent of an underscore for react components yet.<p>The fifth problem is widget interaction. I define widgets as components that are an isolated concern (and generally maintain internal state): Autocomplete instead of FooList. Since the components are generally stateful and produce events, you have to have a protocol for having them interact with each other and the rest of the app. As an example, a FOO widget is a React component has PropTypes that get compiled into a Falcor query and all its event handlers call a function `dispatch` with an object shaped like X. Everybody comes up with this in their app but without a consensus on what the approach is, everybody&#x27;s widget libraries are parochial. This is an active area of development and Web Components is Google&#x27;s take on the problem. Facebook is also very interested in this with Flux/GraphQL.<p>Once all the problems are solved (I believe we&#x27;re relatively close) then we should see widget libraries come into their own. I&#x27;m estimating about 3 years before someone starts really winning the widget library battle and we get a &quot;standard&quot; set of widgets you&#x27;re looking for. I believe that something from the React or Ember communities are the likely source and Polymer has an outside chance (I don&#x27;t see how component composition works in Polymer).",1441288976

Well, whatever it is, it just got smaller. But that doesn&#x27;t really even matter. It is not about how much you do but about doing things well that really counts in life. Not just for yourself but for others too. And not just at age 20 when you have what feels like boundless energy but at age 50 (or whatever) when you have a greater degree of wisdom and wherewithal to offset the energy lapses that inevitably come with getting older. Don&#x27;t rob yourself of the joys that come with aging by letting the limitations overcome you. Each part of life has its distinctive blessings. Make the most of them and be a blessing to others as well as to yourself. If you do that, you will do well and you will age gracefully to boot.<p>Very thoughtful post from a very thoughtful guy. Happy birthday, Jacques.",1441288827

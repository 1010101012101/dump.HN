Alexander called this quality 'life'.<p>I think it is a sad state of affairs that it is indeed so in the modern world.<p>It is also interesting that it happens in so many distinct areas. Perhaps it is a property of the society and how it is structured today. It is of course rare for a community of nonprofessionals to be able to build a complete modern house. Why this affects musicians too, is not clear to me. The rise of individualism maybe?",1361728787

So, your point-in-time type is actually a range-with-granularity-X type, which should be able to inter-operate with range types of different granularities in a well-defined way.<p>I've recently done a lot of work using time ranges (a scheduling app) in C#, using the TimePeriod library available via NuGet.

Its a completely different ball game when questions you face are ambiguous, and needless to say that the effect of being able to easily tap into willing and reliable networks of contacts through your mentors is a resource that is hard to replicate in these sites. A ""Show HN"" thread is great (provided it reaches the front page), but being able to get in front of insightful, connected people that have a particular understanding of the exact problem you are solving, is a much more meaningful resource, I'll listen to the insights from five such individuals much more carefully than to the comments of 200 anonymous comments (not that the 200 anonymous comments are not of use, of course, but one is heavily more valuable than the other imo).<p>YMMV, but, all things being equal, having a handful of people you can reach out to (and just as important, that will reach out to you periodically) makes your own work much more effective.",1361728666

These services normally include helping the company prepare its pitch, negotiate a deal, and ensure due diligence by legal experts.<p>- In return for these services, the companies normally pay Finlay and Lowe a percentage of the capital they raise. (Crow quotes a standard fee of 8%, although Finlay says the percentage varies, and has been as low as 4%.)</i><p>It also quotes responses from the FAN partners, which you can judge the validity of for yourself.

You are doing some activity, either reading a text book, or gathering some information, debugging, or are having some ideas you'd like to structure, basically you are having a need for a structured information collection. At the time it pops into your head; hey it would be nice to have a ""database"" to register this stuff into, so that I later can retrieve it.<p>Then you fire up index, and enter a filename that you haven't used before. Index then fires up your editor, and you write the fieldnames you need, (up to 16). You close the editor, and you are sent to the ""main menu"" from where you can start entering records. It uses ncurses, and is really fast; you move between the fields with ctrl-n and ctrl-p, and are asked if you want to save the record when you press Esc.<p>Later on you can just enter the name from the main menu, and search and edit/delete/add new records.<p>You can make make index sort and print the records in a variety of ways through command line options. You can also have small filter files, based on awk or perl, to filter by a field if you like. I have modified it slightly from the original, so it is possible for a lot of files to share a single label file, so that you can have one ""database"" file per subdirectory, sharing the same ""field-layout"" if that suits your purpose (for modules for instance).<p>It should also work well with UTF-8, and collation ordering according to locale settings.

5275103,comment,5275030,5275030,12,0,lkrubner,,,"We would all be wise to remember that when a lot of money is being thrown around, some con artists will arrive. Scammers will haunt the edges of any scene where people are giving out something valuable. Those of us who read Hacker News are aware of the reputable investors who mean well, and who clearly want to help facilitate the creation of wealth. Anyone who reads this site can name at least a dozen investors and/or incubators that are honest. But we should not be innocent: whenever there is a gold rush, there will be liars and cheats.<p>I have written about this before, but in 2009 I was hired by a small startup in New York City. At that time I lived in Virginia but I had wanted to move to New York, and this job offer was the perfect chance. So I moved to New York. I had worked with startups in Virginia, and I had high hopes about the startup in New York.<p>All the same, what I saw at the startup was disturbing. The financing seemed questionable. The central figure ran what he called an investment firm. That meant he reached out to potential investors and he tried to get them to invest small amounts in his various projects. At any given time he had 10 to 12 projects that he was raising money for. He would raise  $100,000 or more to get a startup going. Each project might have 10 investors.<p>I worked at that place for a few months, and then I was told that they had to close down because all the money was gone. The project manager/COO told me that they'd spent $80,000 of the $100,000. I was not clear why things were closing down. He told me to send in my final invoice. I did. They never paid me. 2 months later I was told there was no money to pay me. I had long (sometimes angry) conversations with the COO about the money. He gave me some reassurances about the money, how much had been spent, how much had been raised, how much there was. But he also said that the main figure had never granted him (the COO) access to any of the financial statements, so he was not able to speak with 100% confidence about how much money there had been, or still was.<p>It is possible that all of this can be put down to the normal chaos of startups. But it seemed like the main figure here was raising $x amount for a startup, spending 80% of the money, and then telling investors that, sadly, the project had failed, they had not gotten enough momentum, these things are very risky, etc.<p>Maybe he had an understanding with the investors, but I very much had the impression that he kept 20% of the money for himself. And he was doing this constantly for 10 to 12 projects. He went to dozens of events in New York and in Boston, he was constantly pitching, constantly raising money. He was very good at getting people to hand him money. But I have my doubts about whether the money was being spent the way the investors would assume it was spent.<p>The normal chaos of startups can hide a lot of corruption. You can use the riskiness of startups as a cover for fleecing investors and delivering very little. In the end, all you have to say is ""I am very sorry, these things are very risky, I'm sure you knew this was risky, we did our best but we failed to get momentum."" And of course, startups are risky, that part is true, but the investor has the reasonable expectation that if they give you money, then you did everything possible to make your startup a success.<p>Here is a bit of age old wisdom: let the invest beware. (And likewise, beware of the exploitive investor pitch.)<p>The fact that there are some famous investors whose integrity is well known should not distract anyone from the fact that there are scam artists in every walk of life.",1361728365

We stop raising whole classes of kids with PTSD.<p>On the downside, the returns are probably greater for police who use drones to monitor traffic offenses. So we're probably immediately fined $700 for any rolling stop. Worse case, drones network with traffic signals to turn lights red right before we pass through.[4]<p>I'm conflicted. I know there's a famous quote about people who trade privacy for security, and how they're all Nazis. But I'm really on board with helping those kids.<p>I know that before Miranda and some similar cases, there was an epidemic of rubber hose interrogations in police station backrooms. I know there's still a lot of improvement to be made, but some simple changes in the courtroom made sweeping changes to the ways law enforcement interacted with suspects. Maybe some legal scholar can come up with a few guidelines that help the police to use these sorts of technologies to do some good, while still restricting their ability to abuse them.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/487/harper-high-school-part-one"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/487/h...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfire_locator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfire_locator</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang_(countermeasure)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang_(countermeasure)</a><p>3.

I was reminded to post this in-depth article today after seeing a comment by btilly about how difficult it is to develop critical thinking skills without specific domain knowledge. That is, in fact, just about impossible. People who have strong analytical ability in one domain often totally muff up in thinking about domains with which they are less familiar. (This is why I dare not give advice about the details of programming here on Hacker News, whatever I think about my ability to analyze other kinds of problems.) I think this is important for all of us to keep in mind as we discuss big, important issues here on Hacker News--sometimes the programmers and entrepreneurs who appear to make up the majority of participants here may have wicked good critical thinking about the problems in their domains, but still have more to learn about law, linguistics, medicine, etc. to correctly analyze problems in those other disciplines. One of the strengths of the submitted article is that it reminds readers who read it from beginning to end to engage in critical thinking about how often they actually think critically.",1361727013

They are playing a bit fast and loose with what 'higher order functions' means, but, for example, one of Ruby's best features is blocks. The details of higher order stuff in Ruby is certainly... messy, but blocks are a great introduction to the concept for people who haven't used them before.

Oftentimes if not always, you get better results by rendering the HTML server-side rather than client-side.<p>I'm more worried about Javascript. Unlike Ruby, which has genuine advantages separate from Rails, Javascript is almost entirely propped up by its status as the only language available for DOM manipulation. Once it loses that footing, it's not a very viable language in and of itself.",1361725433

As a group, they decide who's hot, who's credible, and who's a loser. Rather than competing with each other, VCs communicate in all sorts of inappropriate ways and make these decisions as a herd. This means there isn't a fair market. The powerful people on one side have found it more advantageous to be in each others' good graces than to compete with each other, which would favor people they don't care about.<p>One thing I've learned having studied history is that the best thing for smart people is to create a cleavage within the elite. The Protestant Reformation was a time of high social mobility for intelligent people as the elites of Europe lost cohesion due to the Catholic/Protestant division. Henry VIII was detested by other nobles in large part because he promoted intelligent commoners (social mobility) to high offices who could assist him in his break from the Church.<p>Then, there's the Cold War. Just think of how much scientific progress exists because of this hairline fracture in the world's ruling class.<p>Powerful people want to glom together and form a clique at the top. The best thing that can happen for smart people is for one half of the powerful people to have a mortal hatred for the other half, so this can't happen. As the elites destroy each other, they'll hire smart people from without and that generates social mobility and a resource transfer away from the entrenched elite and toward talented people.<p>If you want to save VC-istan, here's how to do it. Randomly assign all of the top 500 players to Red and Blue Teams. Team identity follows a person, not a firm. It's inflexible. Whichever team makes more money in the next 15 years owns all the <i>personal</i> financial assets (houses, bank accounts) of the other team. Even if Blue only wins slightly, it means the Reds lose all their financial assets. I don't make this as a serious suggestion, but <i>that</i> will get some genuine technology made.",1361725408

But from what I can tell, the above issues are design decisions; part of a conscious effort to hide the internals of the database from the developer, no matter the cost.<p>This is why people claim that ORM is an antipattern.

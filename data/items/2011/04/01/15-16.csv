It's actually not that hard to close if you're willing to look anywhere besides ""cutting domestic discretionary even though THAT ENTIRE BUDGET is less than the deficit"".<p>And, FWIW, many individual congressional republicans may have effectively had ""a choice between 2 budget bills"", but one of those bills (the one we're discussing) was entirely written by Republicans.

There are some speakers who seem to go on tour, giving essentially the same talk at multiple conferences. Most of the time they are recorded, so folks can watch the video afterwards.

In practice, there's a huge difference between being employed or contracted, and running your own shop or self-employed.

You asked someone to trust you, <i>and you were wrong and someone else is going to suffer for it... and you have to pull the trigger now</i>. Ask anyone who has had to lay off someone they recruited and brought into the company - it's miserably awful.<p>Agreed it's also bad for employees to be let go, but writing it off as ""much easier"" to say to someone, ""I'm sorry, I made the wrong decision and you have to suffer for it""...

First, if you are hacking away in a prog language, you need to have some decent set of it ""embedded"" in your mind.  Memorization might help me for those languages I don't get to touch every day, but would like to keep handy in my toolbox.  Second, the data structures and algorithms part would be nice to flash against new problems.  E.g, here is a prob, can I quickly flash it up against my set of memorized data structures and algorithms to see if something ""fits.""<p>I wonder if by the time you come up with an appropriate internal visualization for most data structures and algorithms, you'll probably have enough of a taste for it that memorization isn't useful anymore.<p>As a side question, I think it might be useful to think in terms of how much code you can write without needing to rely on autocompletion in your IDE or without referring to an outside reference.

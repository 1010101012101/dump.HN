4333752,comment,4333578,4333578,0,0,onitica,,,"I just did a quick skim of the article, and call me naive if you want, but in the theory of spontaneous order why is Valve necessary? Obviously, the time and labour of Valve's employees is worth more than what Valve is paying them, otherwise Valve would not be turning a profit. I'm assuming that employees really have 100% work time for their projects as you claim. Then in essence Valve is providing facilities and connections (to other smart employees) in return for the lion's share of the labour profit. Is that really worth it for the employees? Once they have the connections wouldn't it benefit them more to split off their own companies, in a co-op horizontally structured company?<p>Don't get me wrong, I think traditional corporate structures are often abominations and I think Valve is a great company. It just seems to me that if you take the spontaneous order philosophy to the extreme than corporations in general just become unnecessary overhead.",1343998544

He will therefore actually read what the dialog says and not be trained to ignore it.<p>In fact, that is what makes this approach different to UAC in Windows and likely to succeed: UAC came up too often and users learned to ignore it.  It is already very clear to me that Gatekeeper is rapidly adopted by developers. (By the way I also think Apple has whitelisted many sufficiently outdated applications since I get the ""Open"" button for some of them even if they are unsigned. But maybe this is also just a bug.)",1343995496

I strive to do as much work in raising my one child as my wife does. Recently my wife had to cover two saturday shifts giving me two full days with my son ( breakfast to bedtime ). My wife approaced the days like they would be some great hardship for me. I approached them as wonderfull opertuinities to spend extra time with my two year old. Even though I try to do just as much as she does in terms of feeding and changing and general parenting, the fact that for most of the week I am only present for maybe an hour a day gives her the impression that I am incapable of handling the full load of responsability by myself. I see this as the issue. If men do have full time jobs and their wifes are stay at home moms then there will allways be this perception. People always assume that those who are _not_ doing what they do  _can't_ do what they do",1343995363

4333609,comment,4331753,4333499,6,0,lloeki,,,"> No, pixel art is not at all about ""big blocky pixels"" - that's some silly 8-bit retro movement.<p>At not point the article claims that pixel art should be <i>all about</i> big blocky pixels, only that understanding of pixel art is <i>typically about</i> (i.e what the layman knows about it), and even more typically in the context of video games. The only thing argued is that if any scaling is to be applied, it has to take place in the code, not in the image, which actually goes in your sense: the source image, although small, has to stay crisp.<p>So if you wish to really make a distinction, let's call it chip art then, or low-fi, or low-res, but there's no denying that <i>this is pixel art</i>, with the added constraint of resolution.<p>Calling this ""retro"", ""8-bit"", whatever movement ""silly"" is a bit disingenuous. From The Incident to The Last Rocket to Fez, the visuals are gorgeous. And not just the visuals, but from sound effects to music, the audio experience is fantastic. Disasterpeace [0]  the artist behind the Fez soundtrack  created rich electronic music, perfectly in line with my definition of quality (I enjoyed <i>Rise of the Obsidian Interstellar</i> way before Fez was known).<p>[0] <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/disasterpeace/id411023239"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/disasterpeace/id411023239</a>",1343995295

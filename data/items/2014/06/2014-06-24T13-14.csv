The idea that you can&#x27;t build something substantial with Sinatra is hogwash.<p>It is not a given that Active Record -- I presume you mean the pattern -- is necessary, but AR is available in Sequel, which is the usual choice of ORM when build with Sinatra. (In addition, Sequel has myriad additional benefits over Rails&#x27; ActiveRecord, particularly if you want to use raw SQL.)<p>Views in Sinatra are not much different to Rails, so whatever issue you have, I&#x27;m unclear what they are.<p>If you end up engineering a worse Rails then, as they say, you are doing it wrong.<p>As I mentioned, I use both, and you can achieve the same results with either.

What if they got rid of on street parking all together and created more parking garages so that they took up less acres and they could then reuse that street space for more driving lanes or bike lanes or bus lanes etc?  They could then have more parking spots in a given geographical area and better public land use overall.  I think that affordable and plentiful parking is vital to most downtown areas.

7937454,comment,7937002,7937207,4,0,swombat,,,"Actually, Rumelt does not attempt to define the difference between strategy and tactic. I guess from his point of view, that difference is irrelevant - the two are linked, I suppose. The book, however, is about good vs bad strategy, not about strategy vs tactics.<p>Your comment is thoroughly unfair on a whole book full of insight and useful, actionable advice that can be applied profitably to competitive situations in business. You criticise one example, saying it does not fit your definition of strategy vs tactics (a topic the book doesn&#x27;t even cover), and appear to discard the entire book based on that. This is a very unfair way to treat a book and I encourage you to think about what you write, when posting negative criticism of this sort.<p>Your comment is akin to implying that 2001 is a crappy movie because it doesn&#x27;t fully explore the effects of void on the exposed human body. Yes, that&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s entirely irrelevant.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, at the core of the Good/Bad Strategy book is a useful definition of strategy as a combination of three things:<p>1) An insightful diagnosis of the situation<p>2) A set of guidelines/policies/plans to take advantage of the diagnosis<p>3) Coherent action to implement that plan<p>In merely laying out and explaining this definition, this book enables the reader to correctly make the difference between useless fluff and actual strategy. Rumelt then explores all three stages and, in particular, spends a lot of time (rightly) on presenting tools that can assist in generating the insightful diagnosis (aka &quot;aha moment&quot;) that is a prerequisite to good strategy.<p>Irrespective of whether it is &quot;strategy&quot; or &quot;tactics&quot;, Nelson&#x27;s key insightful diagnosis, according to the book, was that his seamen were more experienced at firing cannons in choppy waters than the more numerous Spanish/French Armada. Based on a &quot;fair fight&quot; situation, the British would have lost. But Nelson leveraged his insight into a plan that enabled him to pit the British fleet&#x27;s strengths (skill at shooting in choppy waters) against the Spanish/French armada&#x27;s weakness (lack of same skill), instead of pitting the British&#x27;s weakness (numbers) vs the French/Spanish&#x27;s strength (again numbers). That insight won the battle dramatically and set up the British Navy&#x27;s domination of the seas for centuries.<p>Conversely, saying that Nelson&#x27;s &quot;strategy&quot; was to have a decisive battle vs a skirmish is, by Rumelt&#x27;s definition, a great example of &quot;bad strategy&quot;. There&#x27;s no insight in that - just a wish, a hope. In short, &quot;Let&#x27;s win with a decisive battle&quot; is wishful thinking, in the same way that &quot;Our strategy is to grow our usage numbers by 6% every week&quot; or &quot;Our strategy is to double our turnover next year&quot; are wishful thinking.<p>Strategy begins with an insight of how to change a losing situation into a winning one, and follows with plans and actions to take advantage of that insight. Whether you then call it strategy, tactics, or some term of your choosing, is fairly irrelevant. The point is, this book presents, with great detail and tools, a solid way of thinking about strategy that can actually be useful to someone who actually needs to &quot;be more strategic&quot; and, as the OP appears to be, is confused about what that even means.<p>Sorry for the rant - I just felt irritated by the brief and unfair put-down of my heartfelt recommendation of this book in what I perceived as an unfair way.",1403615343

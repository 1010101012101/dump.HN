It happens to be staffed with federal court judges, and it can issue binding court orders on a limited set of subject areas, but that&#x27;s it; in every other way, FISC functions as a form of internal review board.<p>FISC exists because there is no Constitutional anchor to policies regarding foreign intelligence. Foreign powers do not have rights under the Fourth Amendment. No state really requires its spies to get warrants for all their foreign targets.<p>But in the wake of the Nixon administration, Congress decided it needed some way to create and enforce policy for NSA. It can pass laws, but without an ongoing process by which NSA&#x27;s actions are forced to engage those laws, they&#x27;d be toothless. So we get FISC, a sort of para-court.",1371837598

It doesn&#x27;t matter if this is a woman who you&#x27;re behind closed doors with for the first time, that&#x27;s not a normal, acceptable &quot;move&quot;. That kind of thing is for people already in an established, ongoing relationship with a solid foundation of consent.<p>Reading these comments has absolutely horrified me. I just realized that I have been sexually assaulted dozens of times and even raped on multiple occasions.<p>I was raped by a 17 year old girl when I was just 16 - and a virgin. She bought me alcohol, got me drunk, and while I was laying on my back on the couch, she got on top of me and without asking, pulled my pants down and enveloped my penis with her vagina. She didn&#x27;t even ask my consent, which I did not give.<p>On more than one occasion, I have had a woman, without asking, touch my penis through my clothes and even put her hand down my pants. I remember one incident now in which, while confined in a car where I could not easily escape, a woman started grabbing my legs and crotch and although I repeatedly and seriously protested, she did not stop.<p>Multiple times a woman has grabbed my hand and forcibly moved it to her breasts, buttocks, and crotch, without seeking consent. More than one woman has sat down on my lap without asking permission. Numerous times women at bars have kissed me without asking permission.<p>When people talk about a Rape Culture, I guess this is what they mean.<p>Should I seek counselling?",1371837578

See Here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science</a><p>A simplistic example: Employer A, hiring white collar office workers will get better rates when they say that they won&#x27;t hire someone that is a (for example) a pilot, so the insurance company excludes all pilots from the base tables they use to rate the group. You as an individual don&#x27;t get this luxury. You use a larger pool of people, but they aren&#x27;t predefined as much into your own lifestyle subset, ergo, you don&#x27;t get the benefit of lower rates. Even better, your employer&#x27;s annual renewal actually takes into account the <i>actual experience of your company directly</i>. So, if everyone in your office sees the doctor one less time this year over last, your rates <i>go down</i>. You don&#x27;t get this benefit in individual insurance - the pool is just too big to make a meaningful difference to a single data point.<p>At any rate, HN comments is not the right environment to teach someone actuarial math. Read the link for more details.<p><i>how much profit are health care providers making in Canada under the current system?</i><p>The nice thing about using math is that everything is out in the open. Profit on insurance premium is actually pretty low - in the 5-10% range. It&#x27;s strength though is that it is entirely predictable, so it is rare that the profit is suddenly a loss.

While it is true that people attempt to pursue (soft) real-time fault-tolerance on the JVM, the point in the CloudI article is that the pursuit does not achieve fault-tolerance which can be considered real-time, simply due to the JVM garbage collection which must interrupt real-time processing of an Actor model.  This problem isn&#x27;t often discussed, but is a simple way of showing the problems with fault-tolerance on the JVM.  Without the JVM supporting fault-tolerance, the effort to have decent (real-time) fault-tolerance would be similar to creating a new VM.  Since creating a VM is difficult to do properly, and testing is required after its completion, it makes much more sense to use the Erlang VM since it has native real-time fault-tolerance that is already used in commercial products.",1371836926

The concept is that I say something false in order to cause a panic and through the panic cause harm. (Admittedly I only skimmed the article linked. If I missed where the article specifically addresses this, I apologize.)<p>The &quot;falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; quote comes from the supreme court decision in Schenk v. US, which is all but defunct today.<p>> Regarding the second point, the &quot;imminent lawless action&quot;, this is where having a good lawyer would come in to play. It&#x27;s a matter of definitions and arguing for a definition to side your way.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the &quot;imminent&quot; part of that phrase leaves much open for interpretation.<p>> Kickstarter might not be breaking any constitutional laws, but that doesn&#x27;t prevent them from being sued<p>Of course not. But as my father (who is a lawyer) is fond of saying, anyone can sue anyone else at any time. That doesn&#x27;t mean they are likely to succeed.<p>> I&#x27;m only saying that I believe legal liability is a legitimate concern in this case.<p>I&#x27;ll concede that legal liability <i>might</i> be an issue in this case, though that&#x27;s for lawyers to decide. The point of my original comment was primarily to debunk an outdated legal standard. I got sidetracked with what I will now admit is poor additional legal analysis.<p>I will now admit my initial analysis was poor because after doing a tad more research, I stumbled into a far more pertinent case. That case is Rice v. Paladin Enterprises [1]. Back in 1983, Paladin Enterprises published a limited-run hitman manual [2]. A decade later, a convicted hitman noted that he had picked up tips from this book; this led a circuit court to hold that book was unprotected speech. This paved the way for civil sanctions against Paladin Enterprises. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case, and Paladin&#x27;s insurance company settled for an undisclosed sum.<p>Drawing parallels to the current issue is left as an exercise for the reader.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/rice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/rice.html</a>\n2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_Man:_A_Technical_Manual_for_Independent_Contractors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_Man:_A_Technical_Manual_for...</a>",1371836421

5919618,comment,5918508,5918850,0,0,malandrew,,,"<p><pre><code>   &quot;Without that consent, it is assault.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI hate to be contrarian, because by the standards in most cultural spaces in the US I wholeheartedly agree with that statement, but I&#x27;ve traveled enough to know that there are exceptions to the exceptions people are taking with this material when you take culture differences into account. The majority of women in the majority of cultural spaces we on HN frequent of are saying it is assault. In those spaces and for those women it is. However this is not a universal truth.<p>I&#x27;ve lived abroad several times in different places and the behavior of women in certain culture actively promotes/encourages the behavior being promoted by this book. For example, I&#x27;ve lived in Rio de Janeiro (and several places in the US) and there in particular you are expected, by the women, to behave in the manner promoted by this book otherwise you simply won&#x27;t meet women when going out to many night venues. Seriously, the nice guy approach will net you not one number in a nightclub/dance club in Rio, you actually have to &quot;manhandle&quot; women to enter into a conversation. I&#x27;m a decent looking guy and normally don&#x27;t have too much difficulty meeting women, but when I was in Rio, my US-acceptable &quot;passivity&quot; relative to the culture norm in Rio, got me absolutely no where there. It was only when I forced myself to be physically assertive that women started responding well and flirting back and I started getting dates.<p>With this in mind, I honestly would not be surprised if the backlash we are seeing here is indicative of a cultural echo chamber that finds this behavior reprehensible that is also ignorant of of the existance of cultural spaces in the US where this behavior is not only acceptable but welcomed by women, and that this guide is geared towards men who frequent those cultural spaces. Examples of cultural spaces in the US where this behavior is expected by women are probably the same spaces that the cast of Jersey Shore and their real life analogues frequent. Watch this video of interviews with people on a certain beach on the Jersey shore and try to tell me that these assertive &quot;mating practices&quot; are not only acceptable but welcome: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5weU2olAl-E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5weU2olAl-E</a> . What is unfortunate is that behavior that is acceptable in those spaces bleeds intquo the common cultural spaces where this is not acceptable behavior.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m neither defending nor supporting this kickstarter, but merely saying that a lot of the people on their high horse need to realize the relativism of culture and that some things that may be wildly offensive to many women may actually be encouraged by certain subsets of women in certain cultural spaces. With this in mind, public outcry and censorship of material you may find objectional can sometimes suppress culture and you need to be aware of when you may be doing so.<p>I think Neil Gaiman&#x27;s thoughts &quot;Why defend freedom of icky speech&quot; is particularly relevant here.<p><a href=""http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/12/why-defend-freedom-of-icky-speech.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/12/why-defend-freedom-of-...</a><p>I personally would prefer that this speech be protected even if I don&#x27;t agree with it, but that Kickstarter require that the author write a chapter on the importance of being discriminatory in practicing this behavior in cultural spaces where it is not acceptable and helping them identify women that don&#x27;t welcome these advances in those cultural spaces where they may be acceptable.",1371836186

No, a girl doesn&#x27;t want you to ask for a kiss (it comes off as incredibly lacking in self confidence), but she better be touching you, smiling a lot (at you not just in general), laughing at your jokes, playing with her hair and/or many other things that show you she&#x27;s saying she wants you to go further.<p>Everyone here is talking exclusively about verbal communication, but in courting non-verbal communication is the key context.  Women are masters of it, but most men are only barely aware of it and that&#x27;s where most of the problems in these kinds of materials come from and how well authors teach inept men how to read and respond to body language is what really separates a decent &quot;dating&quot; guide from a misogynistic &quot;how to get charged with sexual assault&quot; guide.<p>The Guide&#x27;s author is a horrible writer and only makes passing references to reading non-verbal communication, but builds all of his &quot;techniques&quot; upon it.  That&#x27;s why they are all so horrible.<p>If you&#x27;re chatting with a girl and she&#x27;s smiling, playing with her hair and glancing down when you make prolonged eye contact you&#x27;re probably okay to brush against her arm or touch her shoulder or elbow or even if you&#x27;re bold pick her up and put her in your lap (but that&#x27;d force a girl to immediately decide if she likes you or to reject you).<p>In contrast if you&#x27;re talking at a girl and she answers in the minimum length sentences, won&#x27;t look at you, and has her arms crossed then touching her in anyway is going to make her want to get the hell away form you.<p>Similarly if you&#x27;re in your bedroom because she came home with you when you invited her, you&#x27;ve been making out and her shirt is off then opening your pants and putting her hand on your penis probably isn&#x27;t the smoothest thing, but probably isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for her at that point either.<p>Again opposed to you sharing a taxi with her and asking her 10 times if you can come up for coffee/tea/drink then once you&#x27;re inside her place and pulling your penis out, that&#x27;s probably going to get you thrown out at the very least if not having the cops called on you.<p>This guide focuses exclusively on what the guy should &quot;do&quot; which, without a similar guide on how to know how and when to &quot;do&quot; those things, will lead to bad out comes if not sexual assault.

Every time an industry has a problem that&#x27;s being investigated by scientists, people start making bribery claims. It&#x27;s absolute nonsense, especially in this case where there is a very active debate in the literature and many hundreds of labs working independently. Newsflash: agricultural corporations have almost no impact on research outputs. They fund a small amount of research, and often the results that get published are not what they wanted.

As a plant scientist, I find the idea of any company using money to influence the results of academic research completely laughable. They might use money to influence the research question, but not the answer.<p>Secondly, we really are <i>not</i> almost sure why the bees are dying.

Both parties submit briefs, arguing both sides of the issue, and the judge applies the facts and law to the case based on the issues presented to them by the parties. Judges generally do not inject issues that aren&#x27;t presented to them by the parties.<p>In contrast, FISC is a one-sided event. Only the government presents its case and asks the judge to make a decision without any opportunity for any other party to make the other side of the argument. So it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that the judges are just approving what the government asks for. It&#x27;s similar to a legal default in any other court. When the other party doesn&#x27;t show up, the party that&#x27;s standing there wins, no matter what their argument is.

I&#x27;m going to try and convey my thoughts very carefully here, so please try and be receptive.<p>(Context for this is for your bog-standard straight courting scenario--I do not feel qualified to comment on how courting for any other gender scenario works.)<p>~<p>In an ideal world, everybody would communicate honestly and openly. You could sit down with a girl, and have a conversation like so:<p>&quot;Hi, I think you&#x27;re attractive and I enjoy your company. Would you be interested in pursuing a relationship, or if not, perhaps a shorter-term physical engagement?&quot;\n&quot;Yes/No/Not interested.&quot;<p>This is, needless to say, not how 99.999% of the population works--as I, and I suspect others, have found to our dismay. Negotiating these sorts of things is not just a TCP ack sequence or something.<p>The fact is that even were roles reversed, that is just not what we would consider a compelling user experience. Expecting explicit handshaking for every step of the relationship cycle is something only emotional robots expect.<p>In an ideal world, the following things would be true:<p>1. People know what they want in a relationship.<p>2. People know how to convey what they want accurately to other people, especially in terms of arousal or courting.<p>3. People are free to signal availability or interest without repercussion, and accept rejection just as easily.<p>These three things are obviously far, far from the case.<p>~<p>There are very much conflicting cultural mores about how courtship is supposed to work.<p>On the one hand, we have hundreds and thousands of years of precedent (and perhaps biology, though I personally hope this is not the case) suggesting that the man is the one to initiate actions, and that the woman, if disinterested, will make her rejection known. Strictly speaking, we&#x27;ve got a bit more barbarous history behind us than that, but let&#x27;s assume decent folk here to keep life simple.<p>On the other hand, we&#x27;ve got this recent push for more explicit confirmation for consent and for the more equitable distribution of first-move-making between the man and the woman.<p>These two things do not go together, and even worse, trying to come to a synthesis for your average inexperienced guy is a road which easily runs to ruin.<p>So, instead we find ourselves in this curious place where young men who mean well want to get with young women who also mean well. Unfortunately, the women are brought up expecting that the men will do the work, initiate everything, and the men are increasingly told that hey need to--to be safe and respectful, mind you!--wait for explicit confirmation of every step.<p>In programming terms, we are setting up for a deadlock.<p>Perhaps even more troubling, the hilariously large impact of social networks and whatnot mean that gossip is worse than ever, and there is no room to make mistakes if you are one of these young men. Worse, media is constantly reinforcing some awful blend of these two mores, making both sides seek after a state of affairs that simply does not exist.<p>There&#x27;s some more issues I&#x27;ve seen, but you get the gist.",1371834144

Assembly language instructions got written to memory according to the value of a specific variable, and there was a somewhat neat mechanism for doing 2 passes (to fix up forward references). It was quite flexible, and gave you all the power of the inbuilt BASIC - which was of course awful, though excellent by the standards of the day - for writing macros.<p>More programming languages should have included something like this, I think. Maybe by now we&#x27;d have runtime code generation as a common primitive, something like LuaJIT&#x27;s dynasm (<a href=""http://luajit.org/dynasm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luajit.org/dynasm.html</a>), only with GC, so you could generate custom little routines at runtime.<p>(As it is, what do we get? gcc-style inline assembly language.

Modern password hashing algorithms, e.g., bcrypt, scrypt, etc., usually also need a set of local parameters. The API should hide them as well, and expose only a set of interfaces with safe and sound preconfigured parameters, which in turn determine how much CPU time and memory space will be used. One disadvantage of this approach is that it exposes the local parameters, hence make it a little bit easier for attackers.<p>This is exactly how crypto primitives have been designed. If the designers of AES ever let people choose the key size, sooner or later some people would shoot themselves in the foot, and set the key size to 1-bit. If you think this is an extreme example, it actually has happened, not in some obscure API that nobody uses, but in the very XMLDsig standard published by W3C [1].<p>Regarding password hashing standards, I found many misuses of libscrypt that would make it extremely easy to recover passwords.

Us sitting closer, slowly drawing our heads closer, lips touch, mouths open, kiss.<p>I used to think that, too, as a teenager. Then I had sex with a bunch of people and realized, who gives a fuck?

That&#x27;s not fun.<p>So now, if there&#x27;s any doubt in my mind whatsoever, I just ask. I&#x27;m in a committed, long-term relationship now, and I still ask her regularly if I&#x27;m not sure if she wants to. Because I&#x27;m even less interested in pressuring someone I really care about into something she doesn&#x27;t want. And she will do the same for me.<p>Guess what?

If you dig into that story (big news at community banks in Japan), the &quot;bombshell&quot; is that Russians like paying Japanese used car dealers for cars, and that Japanese used car dealers are happy to oblige them, especially with regards to cars that are uneconomic to continue driving in Japan [+].  The US leaned on HSBC which followed up with a local Japanese bank.  The local Japanese bank was disinclined to pry into its customers businesses all that much on behalf of a foreign regulator, relaying to HSBC a sentiment which probably wasn&#x27;t <i>literally</i> &quot;They&#x27;re customers of long standing and are, legitimately, car dealers.  Please give our regards to the Americans and tell them that the Occupation is over.&quot; but likely came close.  The US told HSBC this was unacceptable and HSBC followed up with its customers (the Japanese regional banks), who said &quot;Which part did you not understand the first time?&quot;<p>[+] There exists a tax on automobiles which increases with age and which, fairly quickly, causes the tax to cost more than the residual value of the automobile.  It is justified as a public safety measure, since you get an inspection when paying the tax, but is <i>actually</i> a straight-out subsidy to domestic car manufacturers, since it essentially mandates &quot;Despite the fact that your products work for decades, customers are required to buy a new model every 6 years.&quot;<p>[Edit: I should add that while Hokuriku doesn&#x27;t give one the impression of being impressively well-organized from the notes in the Senate investigation that <i>my</i> tiny bank in central Japan believes in KYC so much that their manager-at-the-time both successfully intuited &quot;Patrick is seeing someone.&quot; and &quot;Patrick has broken up with his girlfriend.&quot; from changes in my cash withdraw patterns and wrote these observations down in their log just in case the next manager needed them.  I have many fun anecdotes from working with them, like the time my gym botched a withdraw request and received a <i>blisteringly</i> polite note in Japanese saying that no one with the specified name had an account at the bank and if, hypothetically speaking, the gym had business with one of the bank&#x27;s customers then it should, hypothetically speaking, extend him the common courtesy of spelling his name right.]",1404719888

A lot of the formal CS proofs and axioms and rulesets and all that are very badly and informally written.

From your answer it appears that that people living in these 1.5M houses are not all tech works but rather new double income families and old pre-boom residents.<p>BTW, Zillow uses 36% debt ratio which is like the absolute max that you can possibly get mortgage (i.e. worse case scenario). That kind of debt ratio only makes sense for incomes > $250K. Once you can take out $10K as your monthly expenses, rest you can pour in to mortgage. With that calculation $260K income + $500K downpayment would allow you to live in 1.5M house without cutting too many corners. The downpayment can come in from previous house ownership gains or from equity stakes. This is probably not a good idea because you are in essence investing in already overpriced assets.

7997567,comment,7996950,7996950,6,0,tedsanders,,,"I don&#x27;t think this paper teaches the difference between Bayesianism and Frequentism (though in fairness to the author, that may not be the goal). The paper says Bayesianism is &#x27;aggressive&#x27; and &#x27;subjective&#x27; while Frequentism is &#x27;cautious&#x27; and aims for &#x27;universally acceptable&#x27; conclusions. I wouldn&#x27;t characterize them that way. Frequentism is also subjective (<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/1gc/frequentist_statistics_are_frequently_subjective/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/1gc/frequentist_statistics_are_frequ...</a>) and Bayesianism can be quite cautious. To me, the real difference in Bayesian and Frequentist methods are the types of questions they aim to answer. Bayesian methods try to answer the question of &quot;What is the probability of the model&quot; given some observed data. Frequentist methods try to answer the question of &quot;What is the probability of the observed data&quot; given an assumed model. In this sense, they are somewhat complementary, which why many practicing statisticians don&#x27;t actually care about the Bayesianism-Frequentism debate.<p>I am happy that Bayesian methods are becoming more popular, though, since the questions we actually care about (&quot;what is the probability of the model given the data?&quot;) are often best suited by Bayesian methods.<p>Also, as a physicist I&#x27;m disappointed that the paper asserts that physicists disdained statistics in 1903.

I&#x27;ll just quote verbatim:<p>&quot;One can roughly divide mathematical education into three stages:<p>The “pre-rigorous” stage, in which mathematics is taught in an informal, intuitive manner, based on examples, fuzzy notions, and hand-waving. (For instance, calculus is usually first introduced in terms of slopes, areas, rates of change, and so forth.) The emphasis is more on computation than on theory. This stage generally lasts until the early undergraduate years.&quot;<p>The “rigorous” stage, in which one is now taught that in order to do maths “properly”, one needs to work and think in a much more precise and formal manner (e.g. re-doing calculus by using epsilons and deltas all over the place). The emphasis is now primarily on theory; and one is expected to be able to comfortably manipulate abstract mathematical objects without focusing too much on what such objects actually “mean”. This stage usually occupies the later undergraduate and early graduate years.&quot;<p>The “post-rigorous” stage, in which one has grown comfortable with all the rigorous foundations of one’s chosen field, and is now ready to revisit and refine one’s pre-rigorous intuition on the subject, but this time with the intuition solidly buttressed by rigorous theory. (For instance, in this stage one would be able to quickly and accurately perform computations in vector calculus by using analogies with scalar calculus, or informal and semi-rigorous use of infinitesimals, big-O notation, and so forth, and be able to convert all such calculations into a rigorous argument whenever required.) The emphasis is now on applications, intuition, and the “big picture”. This stage usually occupies the late graduate years and beyond.&quot;<p>The transition from the first stage to the second is well known to be rather traumatic, with the dreaded “proof-type questions” being the bane of many a maths undergraduate. (See also “There’s more to maths than grades and exams and methods“.) But the transition from the second to the third is equally important, and should not be forgotten.&quot;",1404718139

With any framework, there are going to be some things that fit well and more often than not some things that don&#x27;t - I think it&#x27;s rare that any one framework perfectly fits any one project, which is probably why so many frameworks are in existence in the first place.<p>So my ideal philosophy is to pick a technical stack and try something with it.  Until you&#x27;re building something with a stack, you&#x27;re just messing around.<p>Now -- the harder to solve (and more infuriating problem) I see is a recruitment culture that seems to favor buzzword bingo.

Oh man I hate those.  Learning language and framework minutae off by heart is pointless.  In production code, it&#x27;s rare to use ALL the features of a given language.  So you have to be inquisitive, but at the same time turning down candidates because they know .NET 3.0 but not the minutae of .NET 4.5 is just lazy; unless the codebase actually uses the new feature (and then you have Google anyway).<p>(on that note, one of the best job ads I ever saw was for a games company where their only requirement was &quot;show us a complete game you&#x27;ve built&quot;.

You prove a theorem and then you&#x27;re able to use that theorem in your proofs going forward - with the theorem itself being used as the justification.<p>From a pedagogical standpoint - the act of writing that justification is enormously valuable since the book will also have an index where you can quickly look up a theorem if you&#x27;ve forgotten the basics of it.<p>Perhaps the difference is more in the fact that maths textbooks will often rely on theorems proved in other mathematical contexts (where it doesn&#x27;t make sense to provide the proof in the context currently being explored).  The problem being that there can be no reliable way to index that information.  Logic textbooks, however, present systems that are much more self-contained (if not completely).",1404717088

If you care that x ^ (y - z) is an integer, you&#x27;d better have some reason to believe that y > z.

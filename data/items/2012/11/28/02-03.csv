We like to buy/sell and build on cloud as if it is a pure utility where every unit is equivalent, but every year processors change, go EOL, etc. As a provider you have to make a call about how much of that complexity you expose to the end customer. Some customers want complete transparency, which I understand, but the downside of that is hundreds of variations of pricing options and complications around managing heterogeneity (e.g. how do you represent simply how much available capacity there is when you effectively have 300 variations of the same 'size' instance).<p>Of all the component parts of compute, CPU is the one that changes the quickest. Disk capacity is easy to model, disk throughput has changed much at all (minus the introduction of SSD), memory is pretty stable (minus some increases in databus rates). All in for the typical instance in a multi-tenant virtual environment, the same today as in 2006, the two most vaguely defined attributes are cpu and i/o. With the increasing use of 10gigE as well as SSD, hopefully we finally push through the i/o piece. Not sure what it will take to get us there for a clean way to model and describe 'standard cpu' as a provider.<p>Also, if anyone has specific questions about Slicehost cpu priority handling circa 2006-2008 or Rackspace Cloud Servers cpu pre OpenStack, just ask and I'll be happy to answer.",1354070525

4840637,comment,4834372,4835768,2,0,NateLawson,,,"The original commenter said, ""using RSA 1024 bit keys with exponent of 3"" was a flaw in DRM systems he or she had reviewed. Your response was ""e=3 is fine, so long as you remember to pad"" and then ""what kind of attacks remain when using proper padding (e.g. OAEP)?""<p>I feel a bit queasy any time I read ""just do this"" as a solution to crypto flaws[1]. Such answers assume way too much about the system the proposed fix applies to and make it sound trivial to secure. They also leave out all the steps behind what things ""just pad"" means (e.g., receiver must verify the padding and sender must properly generate).<p>When a developer hears ""just pad"", they think ""append a string of zeros"" when implementing a sender or ""skip"" when writing a receiver because that's what it means in other contexts.<p>In particular, your response assumed the DRM system in question:<p>* Was performing RSA encryption of a message, not signing or verification<p>* Used a public exponent e=3, not a private exponent d=3<p>Assuming the reader knows enough about RSA and cryptography to know what ""just pad"" implies, it may still be insufficient to solve the problem.<p>For example, if the commenter meant d=3, ""just pad"" wouldn't fix Wiener's attack.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_Attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_Attack</a><p>Or, in the cases of RSA used for purposes other than message encryption, the suggestion of OAEP does not apply. Consider the attacks against the TMN secret sharing protocol and Franklin/Reiter verifiable signature sharing scheme (sections 5.1 and 5.2 of this paper).<p><a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.33.6527"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.33.6...</a><p>The F/R scheme involves RSA encryption of signatures. But signatures must be the full modulus size (no padding possible) unless you use a larger RSA key for encryption than for signing. So again, OAEP would not fix this flaw.<p>Remember that the commenter was mentioning DRM, so jumping to the conclusion that they were using RSA for straightforward message encryption and with e=3 was not warranted. There are lots of applications for RSA in DRM (verifying a signature on a license key, calculations under homomorphic encryption, etc.)<p>For many scenarios, ""just pad"" would not solve the problem, even with the generous assumption that the reader knows exactly what that means and applies it correctly.<p>[1] I'm not picking on you here. The most astounding of these kinds of errors was when Colin Percival (who I highly respect) said ""use AES-CTR mode + HMAC"" and then later found he had made a fatal flaw in his own implementation of exactly that.<p><a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-11-cryptographic-right-answers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-11-cryptographic-rig...</a><p><a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-01-18-tarsnap-critical-security-bug.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-01-18-tarsnap-critical-...</a>",1354068880

(I wonder now which one of the users you were in that forum thread. sednet?)<p>You linked to the email exchange between Linode support and one of the affected customers. You know that Linode already had an idea that they had a problem before the rest of their customers found it. Do you think it would have been so unreasonable for Linode to at least put up a message on status.linode.com, ""We are investigating an incident of unauthorized access to one of our customer Linodes, we will update this as we investigate it""?<p>And I don't read that implication from taligent's comment here. I think it's obvious that he's saying that they didn't bother to let their customers know <i>when the incident occurred</i>.<p>Basically: he thinks they didn't handle the disclosure on that matter in a way befitting its seriousness, and he thinks that they've done nothing to show that they'll handle it differently in the future. I agree on both counts. As he said in the forum thread, what makes this so frustrating is that Linode has been so spectacular in every other regard.<p>He's right also to point to the CloudFlare post-mortem as an example of Doing It Right. Surely you see the stark difference between CloudFlare's handling of their incident and Linode's? We still don't know the exact nature of the compromise (former employee? Did Linode have an externally-accessible customer service interface? What happened), nor do we have any idea what they did about it, other than that they say they ""will be reviewing our policies and procedures to prevent this from ever recurring"" -- an extremely wormy statement that will still be true even if they choose to change nothing at all.<p>I don't like to see HN threads turn in to a whirlwind of pointless personal attacks.

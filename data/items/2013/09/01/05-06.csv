6309301,comment,6308017,6308655,1,0,mappu,,,"Thanks for your answer!<p>You mean consecutive n-tuples, right? If you&#x27;re checking every permutation of n-tuples in the set, it&#x27;s equivalent to checking single indices.<p>I see what you&#x27;re getting at, but i&#x27;m not sure i can accept it as-is - the result is pretty closely tied to your particular choice of a randomness-test, which predetermines several of the later examples. My concept of &quot;random&quot; would not be strictly based on comparing n-tuples, but more about &#x27;unpredictability&#x27; - so how about a randomness test based on kolmogorov complexity? Although i expect that finding the shortest possible algorithm that describe a set must be NP, if possible at all (that consecutive n-tuple comparison algorithm certainly isn&#x27;t guaranteed to find it).",1378015134

6309291,comment,6306219,6306738,1,0,chrischen,,,"> A little off topic from your post, but this is one of those gross generalizations that just actually portrays you as not getting the gist of the problem with bigotry.<p>leokun, he never stated that. I think you read too much into his statement.<p>When people say &quot;I like x a lot,&quot; they really mean &quot;I like most of x a lot that I have met.&quot; Seeing as you probably don&#x27;t know the guy/girl, you really can&#x27;t say if he can legitimately form that opinion. Thought experiment: what if rdl has in fact met many gay people and liked them. Would you still call him a bigot for saying that? rdl was simply stating a fact. He should not be scolded for stating a fact of his personal preference.<p>Gay people aren&#x27;t homogeneous, but they do share similar traits (being attracted to men being only one of them). So it&#x27;s not unlikely someone can <i>like</i> certain things about gay people as a whole. The argument that saying you &quot;like gay people a lot&quot; is bad is almost as inane as saying &quot;I&#x27;m not racistI don&#x27;t see colors&quot;you&#x27;d be blatantly ignoring the uniqueness and distinctness of human peoples and ignoring the fact that it&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re not different, it&#x27;s that we shouldn&#x27;t treat each other unfairly because of inconsequential differences.<p>Finally, &quot;I like gay people a lot&quot; is a subjective generalization. It&#x27;s not really in your authority to judge what type of opinions he should or should not be forming because it is possible that he has met many many gay people and have liked them all. The statement by itself is not really harmful or insensitive, but I agree it <i>can</i> imply that the person who&#x27;s saying it is naive about gay people and what they&#x27;re like. That&#x27;s probably where you <i>saw</i> the bigotry, but it was merely a projection. However, it&#x27;s not proof that the he/she is naive about gay people. I think you made a logical mis-leap and inferred his bigotry from statements many actual bigots do make.<p>The OP could either have been<p>1) Has not met many gay people. Therefore he is making a subjective generalization. But this doesn&#x27;t affect anyone else but himself.<p>2) Has met many gay people and likes them. Therefore he is not really even making a generalization, but simply stating a fact of personal opinion.<p>In neither of your cases is your scolding really warranted though, but what&#x27;s even worse is you don&#x27;t even know which case it is in the first place.<p>You&#x27;re also diverting attention from the real issues, and from real bigots by focusing on this, and encouraging people to focus on this.",1378014709

Short commute, convenience, midday naps, no pants required... no wonder people want it.<p>But the <i>dis</i>advantages are really only apparent once you try it. It&#x27;s hard to get motivated.

In a blog post published Wednesday, CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince said each DNS request sent by the Spamhaus attackers was likely only 36 bytes long, while each response was about 3,000 bytes. By spoofing the requests to make them appear as if they originated with Spamhaus, the attackers can turn the firepower of all those networks against their opponent, all but guaranteeing it won&#x27;t be available to process legitimate traffic.</i><p>I&#x27;m still not really getting it.  Which IP addresses are they referring to when they say &quot;huge swaths of the internet&quot;?<p><i>To get Spamhaus back online, CloudFlare relied on Anycast, a routing technique that distributes the same IP address across 23 data centers across the world. Internet traffic almost always chooses the shortest physical path. Anycast allows the geographically dispersed junk traffic to be absorbed by dozens of individual centers, where each packet is then inspected. When it bears signatures found in the attack trafficfor example, if it&#x27;s a 3,000-byte response from an open DNS resolverit is discarded in the CloudFlare data center. Only Legitimate Web requests are allowed to be forwarded to the Spamhaus data center.</i><p>How do they differentiate between a legit query and a DDoS query?",1378012517

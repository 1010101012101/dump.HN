It would be in their best interests to make use of you while they have a chance to, rather than cast you aside over petty 'loyalty' BS.<p>The downsides of hiring someone new:<p>* It could take an indeterminate amount of time to find someone of a similar caliber (1 month? 3 months? 1 year?).<p>* It takes a certain amount of time to get comfortable with the internal codebase of a company, let alone the time that it takes to become proficient with it. This amount of time increases the larger the internal codebase and the older the company is.<p>* It takes time to 'bond' with the team and for the new social dynamic to become settled and understood by everyone.<p>* There is no guarantee that the new person that you hire will stick around either. You could spend a whole year looking for someone as skilled, just to have the person leave after 3 months before any of the growing pains associated with bringing on a new person are worked out. Then where are you? Back to square-one possibly spending another year looking for a similarly/equally skilled person.<p>You could side-step all of these issues by bringing this man/woman back on.

I totally support your sentiment that journalists should be out there taking down the bastards of the world.  And we suffer from such a dearth of this that I am hardly surprised that so many people want to believe that this is what is happening here.<p>But how can you possibly assert that just because I'm saying that Arrington shouldn't have broke the story in the manner that he did - that it follows that I'm arguing that journalists should just process press releases?  That's just a ridiculous implication.<p>If Arrington had a genuine tip as to some bad goings on - then I certainly don't think that he should have just buried his head in the sand and ignore it.  He should have INVESTIGATED it further before mouthing off.  Even if he had some balls in making his post - you're confusing his balls with good journalism.

I firmly believe that all the hype surrounding better test scores (better outcomes) can be solely attributed to the fact that the population is self selecting. As it turns out, public schools are the lowest common denominator when it comes to education. In order to attend a charter school the parent must do something. The fact that the parent must do something in and of itself is testament to the fact that the parent is involved.

I've been here since 2001 and while there are several key buyouts in the networking/hardware/embedded industry (in the range of hundreds of millions dollars) back then, things have been relatively slow and possibly in declining state.<p>There has been a few lay-off within 2 years. EA closed their downtown office and laid off 300. McKesson laid off 80 people. Nokia is full of management engineers, bottom-lines are either outsource of contractors. One game studio that shows big potential closed their door early 2009. A few mid-size companies that used to grow 4-5 years ago are in hiring freeze. A few small companies died quietly.<p>Most of my friends are leaving Vancouver to go to Ontario, Silicon Valley (or US in general), or to Asia where mobile and IT are booming like mad (if you know the channel).<p>Here's a few problems with Vancouver:<p>1) Laid back culture<p>Vancouverites are well-known for enjoying their life; rain or shine. They have the ""let's do it tomorrow"" or ""it's almost 5 PM on Friday"" attitude. This caused a hit on software quality. Almost anywhere you go in Vancouver, you'll meet huge pile of technical debts with no plan to pay them. There is even a health software company build their product around MS Access even until today.<p>2) SR&ED<p>SR&ED is a grant given by the government to hi-tech companies. The point of having this is to attract people to build hi-tech industry in Vancouver. So far it looks like it has been back-firing us: companies neither-living-nor-dead. Some of them rely heavily on this grant since their business model isn't strong or their sales are not hitting the target or a combination of both. Their balance sheet with SR&ED will look positive but we all know that they're lying to themselves. They should be toasted.<p>SR&ED also attracts the wrong kind of investors.<p>Because of this, workers aren't getting paid enough. I think in general, hi-tech workers in Vancouver might get paid 30% below the average (by skill, by age, by experience) compare to US or Ontario with no chance of increase or bonus at all.<p>3) Competition is getting tougher and the culture of technology for technology sake<p>It's hard to find a job in Vancouver without 4-5 years of .NET experience with WCF, WPF, HTML, AJAX, CSS, SQL-Server 2005. Or 7-10 years of Java experience with Oracle, XML, XQuery, XPath, XSLT, XSL, Spring, Struts2, Hibernate, JSF, Seam, JBoss, WebSphere. There's one more choice though: LAMP + HTML, CSS, jQuery but working for marketing companies. They too, usually are looking for someone who has 3-5 years of experience. To some people this might be a good sign: barrier to enter is high. But with code quality is so low, I can't and won't understand this particular situation. Shouldn't you get better software from senior/more experienced people? Apparently not.<p>4) The rise of Business Analyst<p>Instead of educating software developers/engineers in here, Vancouver rewards Business Analyst more than the implementors. Schools have been offering continuing studies toward BA diploma degree so they can be employable in some enterprise/corporate with better pay, less work, more politics, and quite possibly more vacations. This lure many people to join the wave.<p>5) Weather<p>While it's milder here but imagine 10 months of gloomy, raining, and cloudy. It can affect your mood (according to scientific research).<p>It's a vicious cycle in here and it looks like it'll be worse. Kudos for people who can be successful building and maintaining a solid company here.",1285221761

You could use any database of your choice for this, with 'sharding'.<p>1b) you could run memcached and the DBs on each of your machines; to be honest, letting the OS do the caching is likely a better idea.<p>2) if you want to continuously go all over the data set, then you are going to be IO bound.<p>2a) therefore, if you can <i>compress</i> your data set - find a space-efficient storage for it so it fits into 250GB of RAM instead of 5TB of disk, then you can avoid the disk and it'll fly.  You could consider storing deltas and then arithmetic or huffman coding behind some low order predictor; ask on this compression forum <a href=""http://encode.ru/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://encode.ru/</a> and you'll have to tell them much more about your data and perhaps describe a few lines of it.  Compression can be on small blocks of data, so you only have to decompress a small amount to get the random value you want<p>2b) or you might find that you only need to generate some statistics from the data once, and then work with the derived data - presumably small enough to fit in your RAM - from then on<p>3) you could buy bigger machines, or bigger amounts of RAM",1285221753

Zero-zero ejection seats have been around for decades and function from zero altitude and airspeed to supersonic speeds and higher altitudes (50,000+ ft).  These will work during crashes.  The F-35 and AV-8B can operate at low enough speeds (hover, or hover transition) that the canopies are laced with explosive cord to shatter the glass (polycarbonate) out of the pilot's way (normally, the canopy would fly aftward from forward flightspeed).  SR-71 pilots wore space suits so that they could endure such high altitude egresses, which would certainly protect at lower altitudes as well.  We have ejection systems that work in most flight regimes.  I don't see significant reasons why a crew escape capsule would not work for even higher altitudes and speeds.  Not saying it would be easy, though.<p>For reentry safety, the best approach IMO is reducing reentry speeds via a lifting body fuselage.  This is what SS1 uses.  With drag bodies (e.g. Apollo capsule) there's all this worry over heatshields and reentry angle; with a lifting body, the vehicle glides into the atmosphere subsonically and heating is a nonissue.  SS1 has minimal heat shielding, and no active cooling.  A capsule is apparently simpler to design and easier to understand than something more airplane-like, but so is an ornithopter over a fixed-wing aircraft (kids ask how planes fly without moving their wings, because flapping flight is more obvious).  One design requires delicate control and handling though, while the other is elegantly robust, more reliable, and safer.",1285221658

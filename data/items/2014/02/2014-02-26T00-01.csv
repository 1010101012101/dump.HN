7301985,comment,7300291,7301355,2,0,Alex_MJ,,,"Thank you for saying this!<p>IMO there&#x27;s way too much fearmongering (largely from people who have no experience trading, or from traders who don&#x27;t want to see other people do better than them) about this. I&#x27;ve traded options on a very volatile commodity ETF before (SLV) and came out quiet well on top by playing with patterns and timing. This was in 2010, but there was the same &quot;THE COMPUTERS CONTROL THE MARKETS AND YOU&#x27;LL GET CRUSHED&quot; fearmongering hyperbole as there is today. It&#x27;ll be there four years from now, too.<p>There&#x27;s smart money and super fast algorithms and all that for sure, but there&#x27;s plenty of dumb money moving around too. There are also plenty of people (I will note: often nontechnical individuals) who make a good living day trading. You basically just have to find a pattern ANYWHERE, IN ANYTHING and trade it over and over until it stops working (...and catch on quick). You might lose money (especially starting out), but it&#x27;s not at all the experience of &quot;you will step in and BE CRUSHED BY EXPERT TRADING ALGORITHMS&quot; that people portray it as.<p>Start a brokerage account, do some reading, put in a sum of money that&#x27;s consequential but that won&#x27;t break you if you 100% lose it, and play around a little bit. Try focusing on one specific (preferably fairly liquid) security. You&#x27;ll be amazed at how sometimes you make the right call and magically you have more money than you started with, and how you don&#x27;t immediately die and get shot and lose all of your money to some corrupt evil high-speed algorithm while being eaten by wolves because, you shameful Icarus fool, you dared to trade on the public markets by yourself.<p>Risk-averse people (especially programmers) who have no experience trading will think you&#x27;re completely insane and lambaste you, especially if you make money.",1393376285

This isn&#x27;t at all controversial -- it&#x27;s equivalent to saying that half of people are above average in intelligence.<p>> What is the p-value that Warren Buffett&#x27;s random investment plan outperforms the market 39/47 years?<p>That&#x27;s not a particularly interesting question (and it&#x27;s not an improbable unbroken streak of 39 years, but a mixture of successes and failures, much more likely to result from chance). What is more interesting is to ask what Buffett&#x27;s market performance would have been without the announcement and herd effects? Everyone wants to invest in the same stocks Buffett invests in, and Buffet&#x27;s investments are public knowledge. The herd can be relied on to make Buffett&#x27;s choices <i>after</i> he has established his position, which means he&#x27;s positioned to benefit from the public&#x27;s responses to his choices.<p>Again, I never claimed that investing is random choice. I only said that random choices work for 1/2 the investors, and those investors are likely to attribute their success to genius instead of chance.",1393376163

Why the hell not steal from a thief?<p>I figure there are two ways this will play out:<p>1) The thief does nothing with the coins and goes uncaught, having performed the theft only &#x27;for the lulz&#x27;.<p>2) The thief begins using the coins, and eventually somebody somewhere catches up with him.  Hopefully for the thief, the law catches him first.<p>I don&#x27;t think decentralized issuing authority is important to whether or not the legal system can effectively prosecute thieves.  The general anti-government attitude may preclude victim cooperation with law enforcement, but I think in this particular case there is too much money at stake to bet on all of the victims taking an ideological stance against using every tool at their disposal.<p><i>(Keep in mind that by no means </i>all* of the MtGox victims are crypto-anarchists or anarcho-capitalists.  There are plenty of regular hapless &quot;investors&quot; too, or just regular old technology enthusiasts who like playing around with new technology.  There isn&#x27;t really a shared bitcoin mentality or political stance, only perhaps a majority that share vaguely similar libertarian-bent ideas.)<i>",1393375777

It has nothing to do with releasing along with FaceTime integration, and everything to do with 10.9.2. was already going through the GM process, and it was faster/easier to add this fix into that and continue trying to validate the GM than it was to spin up an entirely new train for a 10.9.1.1 with just this fix and try to validate that.<p>If this is true, then their process could use some adjustment. Contrast with Google Chrome which has the regular motion of changes going through channels, but the ability to update virtually all clients within a matter of hours if a critical issue is found.<p>(I realize there is a lot more QA necessary for an OS update, but I&#x27;m not convinced that a fix for this specific bug would have taken a long time to QA. Certainly not anywhere near as long as we&#x27;ve waited for this update, or as long as a lot of people will delay installing it because it is huge.)",1393375051

You also need to compare the time element, because it limits <i>how many</i> rewards you can get.<p>For an illustration of how dramatic this can be, consider that a major factor of Apples success, for example, is that their inventory turnover has skyrocketed - to more than 60 times a year as of 2012, compared to ~36 times a year for Dell (inventory turnover was one of the things Dell used to be famous for) or about 15 times a year for RIM.<p>In other words in 2012, for every $1m of capital locked up in in inventory at any one time, if Apple had 10% margin before considering capital costs for the inventory, they&#x27;d make $100k per turnover, for $6m, while RIM would have made $1.5m.<p>That capital is not free - you&#x27;re either facing borrowing costs or inability to invest it elsewhere.<p>(of course the shipping is clearly not the only thing affecting inventory turnover)<p>>  Perhaps investors could buy the goods (or make a loan) after they leave the shore, sell them when they get back, and pocket the difference.<p>Banks have had revolving credit facilities to handle this kind of thing pretty much as long as banks have existed. This changes the numbers but not the overall principle.<p>To be clear: It is likely that there can be savings to make this way - I&#x27;m not disputing that.<p>E.g. there&#x27;s already at least one cargo ship that uses a kite to save fuel costs by relying on wind ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkySails"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkySails</a> ). Clearly that&#x27;s one thing that might make it profitable to making smart decisions about routes that maximize fuel savings even if that may slow down the delivery.<p>My point is just that it isn&#x27;t sufficient to look at the savings for a single shipment - you also need to consider that the shipment will tie up substantial capital, and that has a cost per day too, whether in credit costs or in reduced ability to turn over inventory, and that will create very real limitations on how much you can slow down ships and still see benefits.",1393374140

For all the hype, the spread of bitcoin into the real world economy is a rounding error. For the 99.999% of the world population that has never held any crypto-currency, who&#x27;s to say that any of them should prefer bitcoin over any other? If the benefits of bitcoin are every bit as disruptive as supporters claim, then what makes bitcoin immune from the disruptive effects of new improved crypto-currencies, or for that matter innovations in nation-state-backed currencies?<p>What makes anyone think that 99.999% of the world&#x27;s population will hand over a portion of their wealth to 100,000 cool nerds, because those cool nerds decided for everyone else that bitcoin was their one and only?",1393373362

The reason you can&#x27;t tell what it&#x27;s doing is because it is quite concrete.  One really cool thing about this kind of type system is that the more generic your functions, the more you can tell about what it&#x27;s doing.  Consider this function:<p><pre><code>    foo :: (a, b) -> a\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s only one possible thing this function can do!  And there&#x27;s only one possible implementation--the correct one.  This is the case because the types involved are completely general.

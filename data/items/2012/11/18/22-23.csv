The received wisdom was that it was IBM's deliberate decision to allow clones that made the difference; nowadays we can see that this was only part of the story, but that original belief coloured how people saw things.<p>On the other hand, though, perhaps the decision to use off-the-shelf parts was also part of the wider clone-friendly decision process.  So it's not an either/or, even in hindsight.",1353279599

India, from what I can tell, is a very corrupt society, with bribes changing hands all the time. If you can get the job done with just the police being bribed, that might cost you X. If you need to bribe the judiciary too, and that includes judges, lawyers, a reputable firm, etc... the costs would quickly mount. And, of course, the lawyers themselves are paid (and not cheaply).<p>Basically, one lesson from this is that if you are facing a corrupt system, enlarging the case, dragging more people, more different groups into it, makes it harder for the corruption to have its effect.",1353279407

What's the value of diversity on a technical panel?<p>I'm not saying that diversity has no value, or that the speakers were the best possible speakers who just happened to be white men.  I'm saying that, if you're going to claim that the speakers should be diverse, you need to justify that claim.  Is it better to have diversity in speakers than the most technical accumen, or is it your argument that the best group of speakers will likely be diverse?  What about when they're not?  <i>Why is diversity important?</i><p>Now, for what it's worth, I believe the best group of speakers probably <i>would</i> be diverse, but only by virtue of the racial and gender composition of the set of experts, not because diversity itself has any significant value in this case.  That the selected speakers were white men may be evidence of a suboptimal selection process, or it may be simply a statistical anomaly.

Dogmatic Bayesians often come armed with assertions that probability calculus is the ""correct"" way of doing inference and, further, that there is some kind of ethical maximum achieved when you make your decisions exclusively via inference.<p>They have strong reason to feel this way, of course. Probability calculus is a very elegant theory that can be constructed from rather sane ""desiderata"" a la Cox's Theorem. Furthermore, if you think of ethics as an optimization problem, which is fair, then you're likely to be attracted to decision theory as a powerful tool for being more ethical. QED?<p>Unfortunately, neither of these reasons have the conclusive force that they appear to. The sanity of Cox's postulates and ethics of optimization are still (arbitrary) choices which serve mostly to create a formalized world for us to live in and study with efficacy. There is no doubt that people have derived great power from similar use of powerful models, but models they are nonetheless.<p>Asserting that modeling the world based on these postulates is ethically mandatory is weird. Feeling confident that you can become more powerful than others by doing so is a bet.<p>So, assuming you're a betting type instead of a religious type, would you rather use models that are elegant but incomplete or practical and battle-tested? I believe both Sampling philosophy and Bayesian philosophy to be mathematically elegant. I also have seen them both very practically used.<p>And once you're interested in measuring practical performance of these methods, once you decide to pick things like loss functions and philosophies of measurement, then it's easy to find places where either framework fails.<p>---<p>So really, in my mind, there are Bayesian methods and Frequentist methods and Bayesians who, probably following Jaynes' hyperbolic and recommended work, feel that there is a certain theory of mind which is correct due to its elegance. Most Engineers can pick between the methods and most mathematicians can pick between the theories.<p>And having a favorite theory isn't so bad either. I quite like some ""Likelihoodists"" as well and learn from them every time we talk.<p>---<p>I think the best model of the situation is that of logic. It's like we have ""First-order logicians"" and ""Higher-order logicians"", each of which espousing a viewpoint that a particular Theory is ""more true"" than the other. Truly, they both have fortes and foibles, though, and the practical mathematician studies both and uses whichever one lets them prove what they need to. The problem comes into play when ""higher-order logicians"" suggest that ""first-order logicians"" are inherently wrong since their very theory prevents them from being able to conceive of a better theory and this reticence is leading to disarray. But then the ""higher-order logicians"" can't come to a consensus on how to fix things and also take a potentially infinite amount of time to reach a conclusion.<p>Really, though, our thought is neither bound to first or second order logic.

What ARE you actually thinking when you make your career choices? Do you really think ""I probably won't get a promotion because I am black(?), so in the long run I'll probably make more money as a garbage man? OK, garbage man it is...""?<p>I mean, I'll spontaneously zero in on that one argument: suppose people of race/gender x are known to make less money in a given career than people of another gender/race. Does that really explain why there would be less of those people in the given profession? Seems to me that for that to be true, there would have to be other professions where the disadvantaged people would earn more.<p>Is that really the case for IT? As a black(?) guy, are there other (legal) professions where you are likely to make more money than if you would go into IT? Presumably discrimination would range across all jobs (even white garbage men might make more money than black garbage men), so it should be cancelled out as a reason for choosing a career.<p>Sorry if I don't understand you, but when I got my first computer I was 12. I really wasn't thinking about my career. All I knew was that I liked computer games and that it was cool that I could make the computer do things (actually make things appear on the TV). How would your gender or race change your reaction in the same situation? I really don't get it. And by the way, at the time the computer games of the day were Pong and Pacman, so nothing violent that would drive away girls.<p>Edit: sorry for my extreme examples (garbage men), I just like to use ridiculous examples to make things clear but often people take that the wrong way. I mean I use them for the sake of logic, not to offend.",1353277174

If you look at the time when people use different media (radio use peaks in the morning at 7, probably when people are in the bathroom or on the way to work, TV use massively peaks around 8 in the evening, Internet use is pretty evenly spread throughout the day) you can also see that radio use is also a prime candidate for replacement by podcasts.<p>By the way, the data I was looking at can tell you very little about how people use podcasts, because in the general population very few do. Only two percent use audio podcasts at least once weekly.<p><p> Im sorry, but Im too lazy to look up numbers for the US right now. The paper with the data from Germany is the one I have handy. As far as I remember the details of US media use are different but they are broadly similar (as would be expected for two similarly developed countries).<p><p>Source: Van Eimeren, Birgit; Frees, Beate (2012): 76 Prozent der Deutschen online  neue Nutzungssituationen durch mobile Endgerte.

The first season was an excellent long-form procedural.<p>By the last season, Simon seems intent on retrofitting a structure of ""each season is about one failed institution"" --- the police, the working class, then politics, then schools. For the last season, Simon chose the news media, a subject dear to his heart. But whether newspapers just make for boring TV (see _The Newsroom_ for more evidence) or the story arcs from the last seasons just brought too much baggage, the season was unbalanced and disconnected. Each season involved some degree of suspension of disbelief, but by the last season The Wire was trying to do so much that it was impossible to ignore how silly the whole serial killer plot really was.",1353276269

Even PG has said that the whole business is structured to find the one out of hundred that brings thousandfold returns, in order to finance all the gambling with the other 99.

I'm not aware of any TSA critic who hasn't thought of a different approach that they'd prefer to see. Sometimes that preferred approach is ""cut way back on airport security and let airplanes get blown up sometimes"", which is still a completely valid opinion.<p>You're absolutely right that it's a hard problem. However, the problem can trivially be solved better than the TSA is solving it. There's a big difference between a problem that's hard to solve extremely well (as this is) and a problem that's hard to solve better than it's currently being solved (which this is <i>not</i>, at least not in the US).<p>As an analogy, it's a hard problem to achieve six-nines reliability with a network service, but we can still observe that holding nightly chants outside the datacenter to appeal to the gods of uptime for their blessing is a bad approach.<p>Bruce Schneier has observed that only two things have been done to improve air travel security since 9/11: locking and reinforcing cockpit doors, and convincing the passengers to fight back against hijackers. I agree with him completely. None of the other measures taken have helped at all.<p>I can easily do better than the TSA. <i>Easily</i>. For example, ditch the liquid restrictions. Done. We're no less safe than before, and a huge hassle and cost has been removed. Improvement!<p>For a more comprehensive approach, you'd probably want to cut down on the invasive screening of every passenger. Ditch the body scanners, which provide very little benefit but huge costs. Go back to the metal detectors and regular X-ray machines for baggage. Then take the money you save from this and put it into behavioral profiling, to detect nefarious <i>people</i> rather than nefarious items, and intelligence, to find terrorists before they get anywhere near the airport.",1353276084

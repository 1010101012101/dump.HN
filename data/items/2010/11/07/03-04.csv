1878608,comment,1878220,1878220,0,0,sedachv,,,"Lisp Machines are something that you think is really cool when you first learn about them, then you come to the realization that pining for them is a waste of time.<p>I've had a flash of inspiration recently and have been thinking about Lisp Machines a lot in the past three weeks.<p>But first, a digression. There's an important lesson to be learned about why Symbolics failed. I think Richard Gabriel came to the completely wrong conclusion with ""Worse is Better"" (<a href=""http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html</a>). There are two reasons why:<p>1. Out of all the LispM-era Lisp hackers, only RMS understood the value of what's now known as Free Software. (If you haven't read it yet, read Steven Levy's Hackers - it describes the MIT/LMI/Symbolics split and how RMS came to start FSF and GNU).<p>2. Portability is really important.<p>The key lesson to draw from Unix isn't that ""Worse is Better,"" it's that survivable software is Free and portable. Free because getting software to someone's harddrive is 80% of success, and portable because you don't know where people will want to use your software (there are some really weird places).<p>Symbolics was neither. If Genera had been Free Software, it would by definition still be around today. If Genera had been portable, it's likely Symbolics would never have gone out of business (the Alpha virtual machine would have been done sooner, with less resources, and for more systems).<p>Being released as Free Software today wouldn't help. Genera's predecessor, MIT CADR, was made available under an MIT-style license in 2004 (<a href=""http://www.heeltoe.com/retro/mit/mit_cadr_lmss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heeltoe.com/retro/mit/mit_cadr_lmss.html</a>). There's a VM emulator which runs the code. The whole system is pretty useless.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>Now on to the inspiration part:<p>It's possible to make a very high-performance, portable Lisp operating system on modern hardware. This has been a possibility ever since the Pentium came out. The main bottleneck to conventional Lisp runtime performance is the way operating systems manage memory allocation and virtual memory.<p>A type-safe runtime that has control over memory layout, virtual memory, and is aware of DMA can provide extremely high throughput for allocation and GC (this has been shown by Azure's Linux patches for their JVM), true zero-copy I/O, almost optimal levels of fragmentation, and excellent locality properties. If you go single address space (and there's no reason not to) and move paging into software (object faulting and specialized array access), you've also eliminated TLB misses.<p>Throw in the fact that it now becomes trivial to do exokernel-type stuff like for example caching pre-formatted IP packets, and it should be possible to build network servers that have throughput many times that of anything that kernel/user-space split OSes like Linux or FreeBSD are capable of for dynamic content (ie - not just issuing DMA requests from one device to another).<p>The only problem is device drivers. Lisp doesn't make writing device drivers any more fun, or reduce the number of devices you have to support.<p>What to do?<p>The reason I've been thinking about this is that I came across this: <a href=""http://www.cliki.net/Zeta-C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cliki.net/Zeta-C</a><p>I've heard of Zeta-C multiple times before, but for some reason this time I made the connection - ""why not use Zeta-C to compile an OS kernel?""<p>I explored the idea further, and it seems to me that it wouldn't be an unreasonable amount of work to take the NetBSD device subsystem and have it running on top of a Lisp runtime with the necessary emulation of those parts of the NetBSD kernel that the drivers depend on. If you don't know, NetBSD's device drivers are modular - they're written on top of bus abstraction layers, which are written on top of other abstraction layers (for example, memory-mapped vs port I/O is abstracted). So the actual system twiddling bits can be neatly encapsulated (which isn't necessarily true for Linux drivers, for example).<p>I'm aware of Movitz (<a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/movitz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/movitz/</a>) and LoperOS (<a href=""http://www.loper-os.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loper-os.org/</a>). Movitz makes the mistake of trying not to be portable, but there's useful things there. I haven't spoken to Slava about this yet so I don't know what's going on with LoperOS. I am also aware of TUNES, and think it was an interesting waste of time.<p>The main thing is to get Zeta-C to work on Common Lisp. Then it's to build a new portable, boot-strappable runtime (I think the Portable Standard Lisp approach of having a SYSLISP layered on top of VOPs is the right way to go for this), and either build a compiler targeting that runtime, or adapt the IR-generating parts of one of SBCL, CMUCL or Clozure. Further bootstrapping can be done with SWANK and X11 once a basic networking stack is in place. I think such a system would be quite fun to hack on.<p>If you've gotten this far, let me know what you think about this idea. I also have some preliminary thoughts about how this can be worked into the base of a new high-performance/scalability transactional database startup, if you want to hear about that email me: vsedach@gmail.com",1289102094

1878606,comment,1878079,1878460,0,0,jerf,,,"I wish Yzupnick had left that part out, because the rest is true. Money falls out of a few simple assumptions, which just spewing them out in a simple HN comment (i.e. ""please don't hammer me too much on the mathematical details"") is something like: 1. For any given thing, different people have varying personal valuations of that thing. 2. As people have more of a thing, they value gaining yet more of that thing less per unit. 3. People can engage in the trade of goods.<p>From there it's a short step to bartering things for things I value highly with things I have too much of (or can make too much of) and therefore value less than my trading partner does, and from there only a slightly longer step before an economy develops in which there is a measure of fundamental market value, because the actors in the market conduct arbitrage until there are no more arbitrage opportunities, which mathematically implies the existence of a sort of standardized value measure.<p>I call money the most real abstract concept in the world. You can't actually have any of this ""value"", you can only have dollars or Euros or 1000 pounds of cabbage or something else real, but it underlies and informs every economic thing you do. You <i>just barely</i> can't touch it, it's just as real as it can be without quite being real. And money will exist until at least one of those three things is no longer true. (And even post-scarcity there will still be the little matter of <i>time</i>, and the trades thereof.)<p>(If this interested you, I really recommend at least the first few chapters of <a href=""http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC...</a> .)",1289101990

I'm also learning Ruby on Rails - at the same time. I figure it's good practice to have an actual product to work on while I'm learning the language/framework, especially because this web app is one of the driving factors behind my desire to learn how to program. On top of that, I've got some decent design chops and I've put together what I consider to be a beautiful landing page (with signup, headline, brief desc, etc) as well as a basic user interface page.<p>As long as school doesn't throw my schedule off, I'm shooting to have a very respectable (beta) product launched by Jan 1, 2011 with all core features. I won't release with every single feature I've ever imagined - big fan of the ""release early, release often"" mantra. Other features will be pumped out after release. Freemium business model.<p>Question: Do I release a ""teaser"" page right now requesting emails from potential users, or do I just wait for the initial launch? The teaser page would be designed in the likeness of the actual web app with header, info, product description, etc but would have a field requesting emails instead of a signup button (is there an actual term for this type of page?). If I do decide on a teaser page prior to launching, how early is acceptable?<p>I see pros and cons of both approaches, and would love to hear your thoughts on the subject.",1289100466

If it can build its community, Kik has a lot of new territory to cover if it wants to. It can layer on functionality as it sees fit. For example, it can let you take pictures, and show friends what you’re seeing. It can then let you stream the music you’re listening to, directly from your phone over your friend’s phone. The same can be done for video. And it can be done over any device. While none of this is available right now with the app, Livingston demonstrated this advanced streaming technology to me, so it’s clear he can turn it on at pretty much any time.<p>During the demo of all this, we sat hundreds of miles away from each other, but he was able to remotely take over the Chrome browser (with my permission, of course) on my MacBook. He then played music over it — all while remotely operating this from his phone. All I did was enter a code that he gave me so that my browser knew to pair with the phone and allow the stream. (A QR code can be used, too.)<p>It’s pretty cool. <i>Basically, Kik’s technology lets you wirelessly “sling” any content on your phone to any device running on any software.  This hasn’t been done before, as far as I know. Sure, AppleTV lets you stream iTunes content to the TV, but it’s a closed garden. You can’t run Apple content on other devices. Kik’s technology allows you to stream pretty much any content on any device with a browser, whether it’s a basic PC, or even a PS3, Wii or a Windows Media Center device.</i><p>It’s heady to think of the future of this application. I can scan my surroundings with the camera on my Droid, Blackberry or iPhone with merely a cellular connection, and then stream it to my friend’s phone.

You might not be a very good one (yet), but an entrepreneur is just someone who takes risks for an uncertain payoff. The risk in this case is your time, and the uncertainty is that a project might take off.<p>It is worth realising that the difference between ""someone who builds things"" and an entrepreneur is largely about focus. Why are you making these things? If you're building them in the hope that people will use them, then you should think about users. How might they find your thing and what would they like about it? If you're making things in the hope that they might make money, then you owe it to yourself to learn a bit about why people pay for things and keep it in mind. If you hope to work with others, then any effort you put into meeting people and figuring out if you should work with them is well spent.<p>I don't want to discount here the possibility that you genuinely don't want your projects to get users or make money. If you're building things just to learn and would be mortified if they got into the hands of real people, this probably doesn't apply to you, but I suspect that's not the case.<p>Otherwise, it's merely a question of how much are you doing to make your hope (project takes off) into a reality?<p>It doesn't have to be scary. Admitting that you're an entrepreneur doesn't mean you have to quit your job tomorrow. Many entrepreneurs wait before jumping ship, because they want to take a calculated risk. Nothing wrong with that. The point is that if you're starting side projects and you hope they succeed, you're doing entrepreneurial things.

Some factoids of note:<p>The Bem study isn't unique, there have been 1000s of studies exploring psi that have arrived at significant results. Look up Dean Radin for starters in case you're interested.<p>The Bem study is unique in that it is getting published in a mainstream journal, which is unusual since the mainstream psychology community doesn't believe or like the idea of researching psi, i.e. most consider it impossible. But that mainstream attitude is just that, an attitude.<p>Bem is fairly unusual as most researchers that do psi-research are considered on the fringe of the community and don't get in to the mainstream journals.<p>Researchers that do explore psi risk their reputations and careers.<p>Bem started out as a skeptic when he was invited to critique another researchers psi experiments. He's a well reputed researcher who has contributed his own theories that have been a real contribution to the field of psychology(non-psi related), something few scientists achieve in their careers.<p>So far, 2 papers have been written in response to Bem's study, as noted by another commenter. The first uses the Bem study to argue an entirely different agenda: the need for changes in the way general studies use statistics. The core of their argument would affect hundreds of thousands of papers across the entire field of psychology (and others). How valid the authors points are in relation to the Bem study is open to debate.<p>In the 2nd paper by other authors, it was attempted to replicate their findings. If you read the paper, you can't even tell how closely they followed Bem's original experiment, ie. what software did they use, how did the users install it etc? (and they didn't replicate all of Bem's experiments). One big warning bell is that they used internet participants, which is a shoddy way to do a psi experiment, or most any experiment for that matter.<p>For those that critique the design: Bem took 9 classic psychological experiments that the field is extremely familiar with and reversed them. Designing a good psi-experiment is incredibly hard and a lot more thought and scrutiny than the average experiment. Using classic experiments makes a great deal of sense.<p>@araneae: \nWelcome to psychology research. Almost all the experiments, findings and studies that make it into journals were paved in copious amounts of (pilot)studies and experiments that yielded no results. Such is the nature of doing research in the field of psychology. Designing a psi experiment that stands up to scrutiny requires even more work, failures etc.<p>The concept of backward causation has been verified in other fields, like quantum biology and from a physics point of view, it is widely accepted both by theory and empirical study. It's not that big of stretch of the imagination that the most sophisticated organ that we have encountered in the universe (our brain) might be capable of it.<p>Fact #389: number one reason start ups fail and random critiques are flawed: they're based on relentlessly operating on unproven, unverified assumptions.",1289099712

People don't really mind that much about these things (maybe they just have low expectations) AND it's really hard to implement.<p>I finally made it, right now the implementation is utter crap, with some missing features and some bugs but the general architecture is there and works. I'll clean it up and document it within a few months, probably.<p>It's one of the hardest things I ever made so far in programming.",1289099326

You have to be sensitive to social cues and have tact.<p>Getting in and out of conversation circles: hang out nearby and eavesdrop. If the conversation sounds like one that you have something to contribute, wait until you have something to say and there is an adequate lull in the conversation to jump in. It doesn't matter if what you have to say refers to earlier in the conversation ""I overheard you said x a while ago,...""<p>What's appropriate amount to talk about yourself/idea: as little as possible unless you are trying to sell to the person listening (and even in that case, as little as possible, but more than otherwise).  People like to talk about themselves. Good conversationalists mostly listen and interject with anecdotes of their own that are relevant and the other person can relate to.<p>How to approach FAMOUS GUY: just do it.  Wait for your chance and then ""Hello. I'm x. Big fan. ..."" Most FAMOUS GUYs are used to being approached and know how to deal with unwanted attention. Just be polite.<p>How to ask your friend for an introduction: I assume you mean ""how to ask someone you don't know too well for an introduction"" -- if it were your friend, just ask bluntly. If it is not your friend, ask bluntly, but provide a little bit more context. Why do you want said introduction, what's the goal, etc.<p>The best advice: just be yourself. You look approachable when you are comfortable.<p>Another piece of advice: don't look busy/purposeful. When you are by yourself, just stand in one place, smile at everyone, and wait until you see people that are by themselves. Introduce yourself simply.<p>Edit: whoaz, I wrote a lot more than I thought I would -- I should disclose that while I think all of the above are good tips, I suck at many of them myself.",1289099198

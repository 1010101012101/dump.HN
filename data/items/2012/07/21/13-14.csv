Your list certainly does nothing to prove otherwise.""<p>Just because those sites didn't gain the popularity that Google did, you are assuming the search engine market was ""pretty much stable""? That is classic survivorship bias. When Google started as a research project in the Computer Science department at Stanford, the goal wasn't to become a billion dollar company. They weren't even incorporated when they got the $100k from Andy Bechtolsheim. You draw from a fascinating version of history. Please do tell me more.<p>""Also, suggesting that Google's origin is somehow like cancer research is laughable; they were two CS PhD students playing around with basic hardware.""<p>And this is different than cancer research, how? Where do you think cancer research is happening? I assure you it isn't at a mobile app company being run by Kevin Rose or in somebody's dorm room at Harvard.",1342878979

And if anything goes wrong, then you'll have to pay hefty penalties/fines/royalties or close shop.<p>If your company is incorporated outside the country, granted you might find it a little hard to get your payment processor set up, but atleast you know that patent trolls [which, unfortunately seem to primarily originate from the USA] would be able to only shut down your business in one country.

Luckily I prefer the Lenovo ""nipple"" over a touchpad but most people hate it and bringing a high quality touchpad to a PC would be a big deal IMO.",1342876191
4274706,comment,4274505,4274505,2,0,zhoutong,,,"It's all about value creation. Assuming every party here is rational: Google decides to pay for the Sparrow team only because the potential value of these developers is much higher than the price they pay. And Sparrow team accepted the offer only because the big pay check exceeds the value all their own customers combined.<p>If we hate this, we can either make such talent acquisitions less attractive, or increase the value of software customers.<p>Talent acquisitions become less attractive when:<p><pre><code>  - The number of talents available increases significantly\n  - Economies of scale in software business is less substantial\n  - There's ethical pressure from online communities\n  - The act of ""selling customers"" (through data collection or ads) becomes less profitable or costs more (with things like DNT or ad blockers)\n</code></pre>\nThe value of customers increases when:<p><pre><code>  - More people are willing to spend more money on independent software development\n  - Access to software market is easier (with things like app stores)\n  - More revenue streams with higher payouts (like high-quality ad networks such as Deck and Carbon)\n  - Higher potential to get big (with VC money and building platforms/ecosystems)\n</code></pre>\nThe sad truth is, independent software developers tend to be less entrepreneurial than startup founders (but I don't think the line can be drawn clearly). They are only a little bit more entrepreneurial than consulting developers (which are even more likely to be hired by big companies, but we don't care much about them). Therefore they may not be willing to actively improve their revenue by taking risks, and hence the acquisitions happen.",1342876183

I'd be happy if Google was acquiring them to put extra muscle behind developing the app. But they are moving the developers to other projects. That means a fast, native email client for Mac isn't on Google's agenda. So I'm back to Mail.app or the browser.

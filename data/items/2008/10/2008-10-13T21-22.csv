331606,comment,331446,331588,0,0,arebop,,,"""Galenson’s idea that creativity can be divided into these types --- conceptual and experimental --- has a number of important implications. For example, we sometimes think of late bloomers as late starters. They don’t realize they’re good at something until they’re fifty, so of course they achieve late in life. But that’s not quite right. Cézanne was painting almost as early as Picasso was. We also sometimes think of them as artists who are discovered late; the world is just slow to appreciate their gifts. In both cases, the assumption is that the prodigy and the late bloomer are fundamentally the same, and that late blooming is simply genius under conditions of market failure. What Galenson’s argument suggests is something else --- that late bloomers bloom late because they simply aren’t much good until late in their careers.""",1223935191

If it only took 10 years of practice, Cezanne would have been at his peak by 30, not 60.  Likewise, Fountain was writing for at least 20 years before he had his breakthrough.<p>It also doesn't explain why (in the anecdotal evidence in the article) late bloomers start weak and improve over a long time, while early bloomers peak early and decline.",1223935149

331585,comment,331485,331485,0,0,mkn,,,"This research immediately reminded my of Daniel Gilbert's <i>Stumbling On Happiness</i>, which is a wonderful read. The book details many of the myriad ways in which we fail at predicting the affective result of various outcomes. For example, people will predict that they'll feel just awful for months after an election if the opposing candidate wins, yet report no change in happiness in as little as a month after their candidate loses. Amazing stuff.<p>Another salient point is that we almost never take into account the fact that we accommodate to the conditions around us. We truly believe that if we win the lottery we will be happy forever, even in the face of mountains of data to the contrary.<p>The most surprising result, I thought, was that (in the late 1990s U.S. dollars) happiness begins at $40k per year, and increases only slightly for incomes up to $100k per year, and then is essentially flat. One of the drivers for this was that, at $40k per year, you typically get health insurance through work, and this removes the primary worry that brings people's happiness down.<p>I think the really interesting thing would be to see if you could convince rich people of this so that they voluntarily, without legal compulsion, would give up some of their wealth to make others happy. I'd be interested to see if I would do this, if I ever became a .com/web 2.0 zillionaire.",1223934572

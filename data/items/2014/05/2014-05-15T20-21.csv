7752202,comment,7751110,7751733,10,0,josho,,,"Unfortunately, these companies are often quite subtle and make the initial product much better than predecessors. For example, my experience with the early DVDs was that they had no unskippable content. Then, years later after I had tossed my VCR every new DVD seemed to have all kinds of crap front loaded that I couldn&#x27;t skip. So, DRM done right from the content owner&#x27;s perspective makes the early experience quite better than what it displaces. Once everyone is locked into the format, then the DRM switches start to tighten and its too late for consumers to move on.<p>Of course there are counter examples, like you mention, but what scares me about DRM is how if it&#x27;s done right, nobody will mind DRM at first because it&#x27;s better than the old way of doing things. Then one day, we all wake up and realize that we&#x27;ve been tricked because we are locked in and can&#x27;t change.<p>Today, we all love Netflix, but I wonder what the experience will be once disks have vanished and their growth slows. At that point will we experience FBI warnings, forced ads & trailers?",1400187523

7752173,comment,7751331,7752126,1,0,jarrett,,,"> To get your tests to run in < 5ms<p>In principle, the current Rails architecture can support that. Rails permits the test environment to use a different database adapter. There&#x27;s nothing stopping anyone from decoupling the database at that level. I.e. you can pick a super-fast persistence strategy for the test database adapter, if you so choose. If there isn&#x27;t an adapter you find fast enough, you can even create one. (Such a project would not doubt be well-received.)<p>Anyway, for my part, I prefer to run my tests against the same kind of DB I use in production. It gives me greater assurances. Especially when a web app can sometimes depend on the peculiarities of a certain persistence layer. E.g., your app has a search engine that runs custom SQL--you really want to test that against the DB.<p>Would it be nice to run some of my tests without the DB? Absolutely. Some tests just don&#x27;t need to test anything DB-related. My guess is that Rails&#x27; support for that use case will grow organically over time.",1400187212

While in prison he was convicted for murder of another inmate, albeit on questionable evidence. Silverstein kiled and was convicted of murder for killing another inmate who was seeking revenge for the first killing he was convicted of. He led the Aryan Nation prison gang for a time. In 1983, he was convicted for a particularly brutal murder of a prison guard. Since then he has been kept in ADX (aka Supermax) custody and had no visitors. He is seen by a prison psychiatrist once a month and otherwise only sees his guards when they deliver food. Like other supermax prisoners he occupies a cell within a containment suite, so there&#x27;s no chance of him communicating with other prisoners by shouting or suchlike.<p>Now, obviously Silverstein is all kinds of bad, but I don&#x27;t buy the argument that the risk profile he presents has not changed at all in the last 31 years.

Let&#x27;s think about why such a post is problematic.<p>Rails has evolved over quite a few years in response to actual needs on the ground. Tremendous amounts of ink have been spilled, and tremendous amounts of brainpower have been expended to create a mature framework like Rails (or similar frameworks).<p>Despite the battle-tested history of the framework, so many of these architecture blog posts imply that Rails&#x27; architecture is somehow insufficient.

If this idea is so good, why hasn&#x27;t it ever found its way into Rails, even in diluted form? Why has the Rails team built the architecture they have, instead of yours? (Hint: They probably have a good reason.) Do you have strong evidence that your proposed architecture will serve me better than the one that I&#x27;ve been using successfully for years?<p>All that being said, I have no problem with idiosyncratic Rails techniques that only step a little outside what the framework provides. For example, service objects. Used appropriately (which usually means sparingly), they can help with organization without fundamentally warping the Rails app. Using a few service objects is a departure similar in magnitude to writing your JS in TypeScript instead of CoffeeScript. It&#x27;s not built into Rails, but it doesn&#x27;t really change any of the core concepts either.",1400186861

7752078,comment,7750036,7751539,10,0,briandear,,,"Au contraire. Europe has enormous problems. In places like France, cellular service has been getting faster and cheaper because of competition. For example, Free joined the &quot;big three&quot; in France for cell service and suddenly prices have fallen and quality has greatly improved compared the the days when France Telecom controlled everything. That&#x27;s the opposite of your theory that nationalization &quot;improves&quot; things.<p>Mexico is another outstanding example of what happens when you deregulate telecoms. When Carlos Slim had his nationally-endorsed monopoly with TelCel/TelMex, prices were exceptionally high however, once his guaranteed monopoly period expired and other companies could begin to compete, the prices dropped dramatically. Although Slim&#x27;s company has a huge 10 year head start over other companies in terms of infrastructure -- so the monopoly effects are still prevalent. For example, a cell plan that costs me $100 in the US, costs me over $125 in Mexico. In terms of purchasing power, that&#x27;s a massively expensive difference, considering many other things in Mexico are substantially less expensive than the US -- except electricity and telcoms, which are far more expensive because of de facto and de jure nationalization.<p>There&#x27;s a perception that &quot;Europe is better&quot; that seems to be almost a stereotype. I happen to live in Avignon and have a close-up view of things that are better in Europe versus the US and some things ARE better, but there is a tradeoff. Avignon has 20% unemployment for example. It has traditionally been very expensive to start a business in France as well. The labor rules and bureaucracy makes it exceptionally difficult to hire and fire employees. Public transport in Europe isn&#x27;t universally better than the US. Most people only visit places like Paris, Berlin, London, etc. However, when compared to New York, Chicago and San Francisco, europe&#x27;s transport isn&#x27;t that much better. Spend a few minutes in the Paris CDG airport and compare that to JFK.. not much difference. In the less famous cities and regions of Europe, public transport consists of possibly a train station and some buses. When I was in Wilstedt, German (near Hamburg) there was a bus, but it was so infrequent that it was useless. In Provence, the big cities have public transport, but if you&#x27;re in Salon de Provence, there isn&#x27;t much. I wouldn&#x27;t want to live anywhere else, but the rose-colored view of Europe is often not based in reality, but on an idealized view. La vie en rose to be sure.<p>The &quot;Better in Europe&quot; meme isn&#x27;t always true. Ask some of the people actually running businesses in France.

They&#x27;re going to make a label.<p>Why Apple doesn&#x27;t do streaming:\nApple hates committing to something unless it&#x27;s absolutely perfect. There are numerous examples, but NFC technology is a good one that comes to mind. Granted, they&#x27;ve made mistakes, like Mobile Me, but that was due to poor implementation, rather than immature technology and infrastructure.<p>A similar problem has been in their way as far music streaming goes. The obstacle in their path to connecting consumers to content are labels (the same applies to cable companies and iTV, but that&#x27;s a different story). Labels are greedy, difficult to deal with, and a general nuisance who provide little or no value. Meanwhile, the actual content providers, i.e. songwriters and performers, view labels as a necessary evil, but no one believes for a second that needing them is ideal.<p>The vision:\nThe idea is that Apple is looking to buy Beats to start their own label so they can cut out the label, who is an unnecessary middleman. My reasoning behind this is that Beats is a very strong brand, mainly because it&#x27;s been run by two very savvy music industry veterans who know how to &quot;produce&quot;, in every sense of the word. They&#x27;re more of a household name than any other headphone maker can claim. If any company had the power, skill, and recognition to pull off disrupting the record industry, it would be beats. The only problem is they don&#x27;t have enough money, do you know who does? Boom. It&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>Just take a look at this <a href=""http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/05/beats-royalty-sheet.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/05/beats-royalty-s...</a> and tell me, from Apple&#x27;s perspective, what the problem is with a music streaming service? The labels get all the money and the artists get none. All Beats has to do is say, &quot;Boom, we&#x27;re starting a label and we own the streaming service, so you can have a 30% cut per play and we&#x27;ll keep 70%&quot;. If you were an artist and you could literally improve your earnings by 10x wouldn&#x27;t you? $248K vs $22K is criminal.<p>Just imagine, from Apple&#x27;s perspective, what this would open up? Essentially, it&#x27;s total vertical integration, a pipe from artist to audience, unadulterated by stupid bullshit. For example they could have complete coordination of everything from the original recording quality of an album to specialized super high end digital to analog converters in the hardware - from lossless media formats that were recorded especially for that format to headphones that are tuned to provide optimal performance.<p>This is a complete bargain and no ones talking about it. It will serve as a prototype for what Apple would love to do to the television industry (think Apple acquires HBO, a win win for both), and they&#x27;re doing right under everyone&#x27;s noses because no one can think big enough. Apple would never, in a million years, purchase a company like that for so much money if they didn&#x27;t have a very good idea of how it would pay off 10x.<p>And remember, this is the same company that seriously considered becoming a carrier, in order to launch the iPhone.",1400185958

They didn&#x27;t do any math and do it out of inertia or because &quot;everyone does it&quot;, or because of the completely other and crooked reasons (like the article linked in the thread explains). DRM doesn&#x27;t affect casual or non causal piracy - this was already discussed at length in the past here. Because once DRM is broken, piracy occurs using those DRM-stripped copies. I.e. it takes one pirate to break it in order for others to never deal with it. Therefore it doesn&#x27;t lower piracy rate.<p>And I already explained how not using DRM can actually increase sales. And about DRM increasing piracy, there was an example from CD Projekt Red about their own game which they originally released with DRM (on disks) in parallel with DRM-free version (on GOG). And it was immediately pirated. But not the DRM-free version like you&#x27;d assume. It was the DRM-ed one! They said it was an interesting case study for them, which demonstrated that some pirates apparently break DRM for sport (i.e. who beats others to break DRM and pirate it). So it demonstrated for them that DRM boosted piracy. They never released games with DRM since, and advance the DRM-free distribution cause through their GOG service.<p>By the way, music is largely available DRM-free for quite a while already. You can buy DRM-free files on Cdbaby, Amazon or tons of other music sites. Which again demonstrates the point that DRM-free distribution works just fine.<p><i>> This is a huge industry with enormous power- why would they give that up over some upset rights activists?</i><p>That&#x27;s exactly the point. DRM is all about certain control (over the market for example), but not about piracy. Surely those who have that control want to retain it. But they lie to the public claiming that DRM is used for preventing piracy, while really it&#x27;s used for control. It just adds to the reasons to always oppose it.",1400185731

The biggest negotiation point for most people is the job offer, and the usual advice for that is to, as an applicant, never give them a number first. Perhaps the more important points are:<p>1. Never give them any of your previous salaries, as this may anchor you to a much lower price than they are willing to pay for your talents<p>2. Never negotiate salary before they have conditionally agreed that they want to hire you, as this is when their perceived value of you is the highest. If you start negotiating before this point, their value of you will be lower, and you&#x27;ll have to either refuse to go down and have to break off the whole thing, or anchor yourself to a lower number than your talents are really worth.<p>On top of that, giving them a number first is usually not to your advantage, as you probably have less information about what the market is really like and what they are really willing to pay for you, but this is a weaker point than the above two.

The death of the set-top box is predicted annually and I am afraid you have joined that long pantheon of people who have prematurely declared it deceased. I will now let you know why I am quite sure you are mistaken:<p>1) Set-top boxes aren’t a technological solution, they are a business solution. I know of one company who did actually eliminate them, but I am not aware of any other company who has followed their lead. The real essence of set-top box is about maintaining customer ownership. If the pay TV companies, and remember that a large portion of the market globally is satellite not cable, want to own their customer they have to own the access to content. Content access involves managing the user experience that the consumer sees, managing the programme guide, managing the channel numbers is an especially valuable business and managing interactivity.<p>2) Samsung has been in the set-top box business for a long time and they aren’t a dominant player in the sector. People see Samsung’s consumer electronics business and they see one big player, when in reality it is a conglomerate business with different leaders fighting for their budgets/resources/customers. The TV business has nothing to do with the set-top box business, nothing at all, they are completely different business units with different agendas and different tools. Samsung’s entry in to RDK is about as significant as that of Humax.<p>3) CableCARD: This is an predominantly American phenomena, in Europe there is the CI(+) CAM, but most Pay TV operators won’t allow it to be used because of the perceived security risks. The other interesting feedback I have from people who deal with the US market is that CableCARD is a PITA, so support is always going to be an issue.<p>4) All operators complain about the capital cost of set-top boxes, an asset that sits in the field and causes them support issues, but none of them want to dispose of them entirely. This is why the predominant trend in set-top boxes is towards thin clients with cloud services. Unfortunately copyright players have made the introduction of services in this area difficult. Add to that the USA’s fragmented local content offering the regional deployment of cloud services isn’t trivial.<p>Overall your post is very US centric and in my many years of travelling the globe working in television the one thing that I see as being constant: the USA is not typical of any other TV market. The USA has its own technology, its own legal problems and its own logistical problems.<p>While there might be an increase in cord cutting/shaving around the world the risk to cable operators is mainly for those that don’t adapt to the needs of the consumer. Those companies deserve to suffer, because nature as well as economics always shows us that those who don’t adapt die.",1400185276

Abstraction has value in these scenarios. And just like everything, it can be abused (e.g. abstracting over 3 scenarios with 5 lines of code in total to support a particular once off business case that is going to be discarded after running once).  That doesn&#x27;t mean abstraction no longer has value.<p>Furthermore, languages with static type checking require different styles of testing and coding (e.g. abstraction) vs languages with dynamic type checking.  Neither approach is universally better for all problem solving.

They also need to make money, so one can&#x27;t claim they have less business sense than legacy publishers.<p>For example, in computer games there are more and more DRM-free releases coming out each year. And this already includes funded by publishers, and not just indie games. With more competition releasing something DRM-free, there would be more reasons for publishers to change their attitude. With movie industry that doesn&#x27;t happen yet because competition is still weak. Most publishers are a tight conglomerate of related companies which follow the same policies and agree on common terms. It can be enough for one strong disruptor to break that situation.",1400184195

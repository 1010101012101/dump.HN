As a payor, they would have direct access to their employee&#x27;s medical records. Whereas under normal circumstances, the payor/insurer only provides the employer non-PHI data such as enrollment/disenrollment info and summary data (at an aggregate level) to support pricing discussions, which is why they aren&#x27;t usually a covered entity.

You still preserve most of the benefits of self-insuring while protecting yourself against outliers, in the same way that you come out ahead if you skip insuring the loss of your refrigerator, but do insure the loss of your house.<p>The biggest issue is the principal-agent problem - it costs some amount to insure against once-every-20-year claims, and by that time the CEO is likely to be retired, so why buy the coverage?<p>That&#x27;s one of the reasons why insurance companies per se are highly regulated.",1391979562

7207172,comment,7202146,7204914,2,0,akkartik,,,"The biggest limitation of functions is precisely what you point out: they create scopes. So you end up complecting (<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>) what variables you need access to at a time with what variables you want to describe and explain at a time.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s controversial that functions have limitations. For example, OO in many ways was an attempt to work around the limitations of functions. But what OO discovered, I think, was that any sort of modularity mechanism when baked into the language brings in its own constraints, which limit the situations where it can be used. The classic example is all the constraints on C prototypes that make any sort of refactoring of include files an NP-hard problem, dooming lots of codebases to never get the reorganization they need to free them from historical baggage. So I&#x27;ve gradually, grudgingly started to focus on more language-independent, tool-based approaches that can overlay an &#x27;untyped&#x27; layer atop even the most rigid language.<p><i>&quot;Because variables are accessible and manipulable in your snippets there isn&#x27;t any containment like you get with functions.&quot;</i><p>My claim (<a href=""http://akkartik.name/post/readable-bad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akkartik.name/post/readable-bad</a>) is that in seeking local properties like containment/encapsulation we deemphasize global understanding. Both are useful, certainly, but they&#x27;re often in tension and our contemporary rhetoric ignores the tension. The pendulum has swung so much in favor of local rules for &#x27;good style&#x27; that it&#x27;s worth temporarily undoing some of that work to see what we&#x27;re giving up, what the benefits of playing fast and loose with local structure might be.<p><i>&quot;..following the flow of control is a little more difficult..&quot;</i><p>Yeah that&#x27;s a valid concern. I think literate programming failed to catch on partly because we need at times to see the entire flow of control in a function. Like when we&#x27;re debugging. I have a vague vision that programmers of the future will work with the expository and &#x27;tangled&#x27; views of a program side by side.

That&#x27;s the benefit of naming fragments in literate programming, isn&#x27;t it? I hadn&#x27;t considered that; the examples I&#x27;ve seen never mention it. But emacs org-mode and <a href=""http://leoeditor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leoeditor.com</a> certainly seem to find reuse useful. Hmm. I haven&#x27;t encountered the need for reusing snippets so far. That might change, and we can probably come up with some syntax to support it if so. I suspect, however, that our languages already have plenty of primitives for enabling reuse. We don&#x27;t need any extra tool or meta-linguistic support.<p>---<p>Clicking through to your profile I ended up at <a href=""http://essays.kuntz.co/you-re-probably-not-for-hackers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://essays.kuntz.co/you-re-probably-not-for-hackers</a>, which suggests we have kindred sensibilities about these questions!

JavaScript is in fashion today, however, as web is replacing desktop apps we will have more and more capable and large scale applications. It won&#x27;t be possible to develop them in JavaScript because of its lack of support for large scale development. All these languages have compiler to JS (and in future probably will have compilers to asm.js), and I think, they will replace JS in the future.<p>- Algorithms and data structures (It&#x27;s very hard to find a person who can describe well how hash tables work. I interviewed many people who studied this at university).<p>- Programming language theory. It makes you better programmer, since you will have a better understanding of why languages are implemented the way they are.<p>- Mathematics which is relevant to software: discrete math, statistics (data science is on the rise now), mathematical logic. These skills are timeless<p>This part is more speculative (however, I personally bet on this stuff):<p>- Reactive libraries. They allow you to become so much productive. You can learn Reactive Extensions (<a href=""https://rx.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rx.codeplex.com/</a>) or one of its port to other languages. Also I can recommend you the framework which we developed at JetBrains: <a href=""https://github.com/JetBrains/jetpad-mapper"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JetBrains/jetpad-mapper</a>.<p>- Web platform. I mean WebGL, WebCL, WebWorkers, and other HTML5 APIs. The next generation of apps will be based on the web platform, and you need to be fluent in these APIs to be relevant.<p>- Emerging languages: Scala, Kotlin, Rust. Don&#x27;t learn Go, that language is defective by design. Also don&#x27;t learn Haskell, the language isn&#x27;t widely used and if we take a language + popular extensions it&#x27;s more complicated than C++. Haskell will probably be replaced by one of the dependently typed programming languages.<p>- Dependently typed programming language. Currently, they are mostly academic languages, however, they give us a promise of writing reliable software by construction without too much effort. The best language here is Agda. However, you might want to learn Coq or Idris.<p>Things you should stay away from:<p>- Do not learn dynamic languages unless you have to (for ex. JavaScript, I hate it, but I have to write code in it from time to time). Modern statically typed languages are so good now, that they give you almost all advantages of dynamic language while keeping code correct.<p>- Do not learn language which try to make themselves easier at the cost of correctness: Go (lack of generics) and Dart (optional unsound type system). I think they won&#x27;t work out despite the fact that Google backs them.",1391978868

Then when I was really fluent in it and started hitting its limits around the 9th grade (I was mostly interesting in writing real time games), I picked up z80 assembly. Later (10th grade) I wanted to write programs on my computer, I installed Linux and learned C (not that they&#x27;re related, but the hacker world really intrigued me. It also means that I spent my first &quot;real&quot; programming years as a member of the broad Linux community; I even submitted patches to large FOSS projects like Gnome, which still shapes me as an engineer to this day).<p>Then in university we used Ada for algorithms/application programming the first semester (partly because I&#x27;m French, and French professors love the fact that Ada is French; and partly for the reasons parent poster mentioned), before transitioning to C (at first for Unix programming, and then more general programming), and finally doing C++/Java in our final year (we also had a few domain specific classes where we used a different language: SQL for databases, assembly for electrical engineering, PHP for webdev, etc.).<p>I really like the progression I followed, as I feel like it was logically consistent, exposed me to a lot of different aspects of computer science, and forged me into a fairly solid programmer. I&#x27;ve tutored students whose first language was Java, and their mental model of programming/computer science was a big mess. The best of them figured things out a year or so in, but a lot of them remained confused throughout their college years.<p>Now I volunteer with a program that teaches kids how to program, and we use Ruby. I think Ruby/Python are great for giving beginners a taste of programming; and it&#x27;s enough for the kids who don&#x27;t fall in love with it. But with the kids for whom programming just clicks and is clearly going to be their field of predilection as a teenarger/college student, I&#x27;m starting to believe that C (ideally on an Unix system) is the way to go.",1391978098

Yesterday, in fact, we had 3 boys and 6 girls for our scratch class, then had 8 girls and 2 boys for our interactive fiction class, taught in Twine.<p>Couple things we&#x27;ve learned. First, girls default to pair programming. They cluster, they work together, when they have a problem, they solve it for one another before asking the teachers. They work together and don&#x27;t compete. The boys compete and try to get way far ahead of the teachers, and end up getting lost. The girls all move at the same pace except for the ones who were advanced-class level when they showed up.<p>Second thing: little girls are not affraid, and not any less able to do this. It&#x27;s a societal thing that pushes them away. They see the girls in their classes interested in other things, so they don&#x27;t get interested in computers. Instead, they get interested in facebook, not the computer itself, because their older siblings use it, their friends use it, and they then learn that computers are for socializing. Given the proper environment, they can learn anything a geek would learn, it&#x27;s just that they don&#x27;t get spoon fed computer knowledge, they get spoon fed facebook, Snapchat, Pokemon and Minecraft knowledge.<p>Third: Minecraft cuts across all genders. All kids absolutely adore Minecraft, and about 50% want to learn programming just to make mods for the game.<p>Finally, girls who come to our classes keep coming back. They have a little social group with the other girls, and they welcome in other girls. The boys are left out, mostly, but that&#x27;s fine as they&#x27;re not having trouble learning or keeping up.  The girls in our classes are their own support mechanism, and they tend to become friends outside of classes.<p>So, learn from this what you will.",1391977904

As a voter in a state with as many as ten candidates on the ballot in a typical presidential election, and some amazingly close three-way statewide elections,[2] I&#x27;m surprised that the Arrow paradox (Arrow impossibility theorem) isn&#x27;t more widely known. I learned about it in an article in Scientific American back in the 1970s. My state has three &quot;major parties&quot; that have automatic ballot access for nominated candidates, and I expect that this year we may add one more political party to the list of major parties by the rules established in state law. If voters have more than two choices, odd results can happen in elections.<p>AFTER EDIT: A comment posted while I was typing the first version of this comment mentions &quot;range voting&quot; as a response to the Arrow paradox. A commentary by an economist[3] and a problem set by a mathematician[4] may suggest to thoughtful readers here some issues to ponder while discussing whether or not range voting provides better trade-offs than our current voting system, and whether it indeed escapes the theorem proved by Arrow.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow&#x27;s_impossibility_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow&#x27;s_impossibility_theorem</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/arrow.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/arrow.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/11/franken-coleman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/11/franken-c...</a><p><a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24383.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24383.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/This-Is-Not-Florida-Minnesota/dp/0816670382"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/This-Is-Not-Florida-Minnesota/dp/08166...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/11/range-voting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/11/ran...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2008/anema/approval.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2008/anema/approval.h...</a>",1391977438

Like Rohlf, I learned to program TI-Basic in middle school, and like him, I&#x27;ve had the ability to see several different teaching paradigms when it comes to computer science.<p>In the high school computer science courses I was able to take, the programs were relatively simple with an, in my opinion, too-overt emphasis on object oriented programming. It was in java, and very little of the class focused on the &quot;how&quot; aspect of the language.<p>My first CS courses at university were in Ada. I don&#x27;t know how many of y&#x27;all have programmed in Ada, but I think about it like a wordier C that doesn&#x27;t let you just get away with shit because it&#x27;s strongly typed. This was the language we were taught basic control structures in and, to be fair, the way we were taught focused on good styling so that our code would be unreadable mush.<p>The UNIX class was in C, and it is, in my opinion, the most rigorous course that most of the students will take on their way to the bachelor&#x27;s degree. The students build, across a series of projects, a shell that can execute commands and run simple scripts. The sorts of problems encountered introduce the students to the nature of C at a very low level, as well as the sorts of structures that can be used to solve practical problems.<p>Many of the high level more theoretical classes are language-agnostic, and many of the students use either Python or C#. I think that it&#x27;s good that these higher-level theoretical classes allow us to choose our own language, because I think that the ways in which different programmers attack the same problem might bias them towards one or another language.<p>Recently, the lower-level classes had their programming language changed. Heeding the argument that Ada wasn&#x27;t super relevant in the higher-level classes, the faculty changed the language to Python. This was, I think, a mistake. My opinion is that the lower level classes should be taught in C for many of the same reasons Rohlf mentioned. I think it&#x27;s important that the students have an idea of how their data is being represented on the disk so that they could better understand the costs associated with certain tasks.<p>The best argument that I heard for Python was that not everybody taking these into classes go on to write the sort of code that requires something fast or efficient. Python makes data processing easy, which is really the most important thing that students should learn in intro-to-programming classes. I&#x27;d say this is a fair point.",1391976488

Oh, no wait, people are forking Linux because that&#x27;s one of the main ideas behind open source software: you can fork it and make it do what <i>you</i> want.<p>> Sure, except neither of those fulfils the contract of the API. They might be good enough, but if an app has a button that says &quot;share this on G+&quot; and it ends up sharing on Facebook instead, that&#x27;d be a little weird, don&#x27;t you think?<p>This isn&#x27;t how the sharing API works at all, and he&#x27;s clearly never used it. All you do is add a ShareActionProvider to your ActionBar and it works with <i>anything</i> that supports the sharing intent.

The Android platform has standards and you have to stick to them, just like any other platform you want to base yourself on if you want to be compatible. The APIs happen to be <i>the</i> standard for Android. Without them there would be no compatibility between various Android distributions. You can, of course, always add additional APIs on top, which is exactly what Samsung, Motorola, etc. do with their SDK add-ons. Really though, you can&#x27;t complain that &quot;[a]ny platform using Android in this way would have only a limited ability to take the platform in a different direction from the one Google chose&quot; because &quot;[v]arious aspects of how Android is used are determined by the underlying APIs&quot;, and then complain they don&#x27;t provide an API for other, more proprietary things like an IAP system (&quot;Why not ship an IAP system that has code that defaults to using Google&#x27;s services on the back-end, but could be swapped out without breaking apps&quot;).  This point is total insanity by Peter.<p>> Read Ben Evans&#x27; piece on how Microsoft should relegate Android to being nothing more than a stack of debugged device drivers.

7206929,comment,7206384,7206384,2,0,mrsteveman1,,,"I tried this for a while. Before, I was using chrome on OS X and safari on iOS, just tolerating the lack of bookmark sync. I switched to safari on OS X because chrome was being slow, and images would suddenly stop loading. But using safari full time made me run screaming in the other direction on all platforms and I just switched back to chrome, I&#x27;m even using it 100% on iOS now that I worked around the problems in the article.<p>Safari on OS X has so many annoying little behaviors that become a problem in constant use. Things like accidentally closing a tab (or a whole window with 40 of them) and being unable to get them back without scrolling through history, or the poor handling of the tab bar, forcing you to click the drop down to get to the rest of them when there are too many to fit on screen at once. One that constantly bit me: right click a selection and search with google. In chrome it&#x27;s in a new tab, in safari it blows away what you were doing in the same tab.<p>I also found out TLS client certificates on a websocket cause the connection to fail in Safari on OS X, it never authenticates and it shows up in a non-obvious way. I lost a whole 2 days of dev time on that thinking I did something wrong, only to notice it worked in chrome.<p>Safari was also crashing all the time, both in the middle of important things like writing a few paragraphs in a text box (and having them vanish), but also on stuff that is a major core function of the browser like typing in the URL bar.<p>I do like iCloud Keychain but it still works on iOS because Chrome on OS X puts passwords in the keychain and they get synced. It may not autofill in chrome on iOS (edit: it does I just tried) but I haven&#x27;t noticed, I only have to enter passwords 1-2 times every few weeks, the rest of the time sessions stick around.<p>Safari also made me realize I needed bookmark sync on iOS very badly, so I had to get that feature back with Chrome.<p>The main problems in the article about chrome on iOS - lacking the fast JS engine, and inability to set chrome as the default browser (which leads to other problems) - were solved by jailbreaking and I&#x27;m absolutely pleased with the result I&#x27;ll never give it up now. My stuff still syncs (yay bookmarks!), and chrome now handles all links from other apps and emails so I actually end up using it instead of accidentally ending up in safari. And it does a lot of little things better, like the reappearance behavior of the URL/tab bar during scrolling, VERY nice. Plus chrome dev tools are low friction for me, while safari again annoyed me to no end.<p>Something about google being a company whose developers spend a lot of time on the web doing development, and dogfooding chrome in the process, has resulted in Chrome being low friction in ways safari isn&#x27;t.",1391976236

Since we are only tabulating the final total, we can modify the &#x27;reduce&#x27; mawk invocation to be as follows:<p><pre><code>  mawk &#x27;\n  {games += ($1+$2+$3); white += $1; black += $2; draw += $3}\n  END { print games, white, black, draw }&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nMaking the bottle-neck data stream thinner always helps with overall throughput.",1421693320

Even before you consider corruption, the government is disproportionately helping rich people by enforcing that they have exclusive access to a larger share of the world&#x27;s resources. That&#x27;s fundamentally what it means to be &quot;rich&quot;.<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not going to suggest completely abolishing property rights. I just get sick of people using &quot;it&#x27;s coercion&quot; as an argument against any government intervention, while quietly ignoring the absolutely huge amount of coercion involved in enforcing a &quot;free market&quot;.<p>>Nobody will be able to make money by favoritism or coercion or corruption if there is no entity (e.g. government) that facilitates those things.<p>People are perfectly capable of favouring, coercing and corrupting others without any help. Centralised power can make it worse in some cases, but it&#x27;s not like all that power disappears when you take away the government.",1421692536

GNU can certainly control what is mainlined, but the GPL is not violated simply by creating a GPL plugin that provides a useful output target.<p>If Emacs were enhanced to support a standardized file format which contains the relevant information, then it could accept this format from any tool.  The GCC plugin could output this format, as could Clang/LLVM.  Because the format is universal, it likely would be mainlined.<p>Then, it&#x27;s up to the user.  If the user wants to integrate the two, the user can apply the appropriate patch to GCC to incorporate this independent plugin.

Marijuana was helpful too, though it had its moments of making things worse, but for the most part A+++ rating, would smoke again.<p>My anxiety manifested itself in some pretty severe panic attacks, extreme hypochondria and some pretty intense derealization.

8913156,comment,8912860,8913099,0,0,maccard,,,"> Cons: Playing with the Stress demos (especially #2) really shows the slowdowns and downsides to using a JS based engine. At 450 boxes (+ 4 bounding walls), it runs at 20fps on my Macbook and thats with a lot of jitter and overlap. Not as fun.<p>Have you tried enabling sleeping? Even most AAA games don&#x27;t actually have even remotely close to that number of bodies active in a game at once. Sure, the engines can handle it, but having a stack of bodies like the stress demos is the absolute worst case, as you normally have to resolve a chain of contacts, in this case a few hundred, iteratively. Most physics engines also benefit hugely from multithreading, something which JS doesn&#x27;t provide.<p>> I wish I could see a physics engine using WebGL and GPU acceleration for the web. This one is a great start if the author were to take it further and implement some of the logic with shaders.<p>That was tried on PC and consoles and most game developers are going back to using the CPU for physics calculation, and using the GPU for rendering. Using WebGL with this particular demo shouldn&#x27;t increase the performance if the bottleneck is the physics simulation.",1421691828

With a very distrusting attitude.<p>The last major MS ecosystem project I worked on was with a big MS fan, during his college summers he&#x27;d worked on Internet Explorer back when it was getting to be <i>much</i> better than Netscape.  And turned down a full time offer from them for more of the same to work on his brother&#x27;s company.<p>But circa 1997 he was not willing to trust SQL Server as it was then with the company&#x27;s fate when it was time to move from the superb Access Jet database engine, and I suggested and implemented IBM&#x27;s DB2 as a 1/2 price alternative to Oracle (biggest issue was no MVCC, but that was OK for a tight knit group of programmers; the sysadmin and DBA job was in turn easier than Oracle&#x27;s long evolved mess).<p>Fortunately never had to go back after that, and prior to that I learned Windows 3.0 though NT 3.51 the hard way, back when that wasn&#x27;t a nightmare.  NT 3.51 SP2 or so was when it started going to hell).  I made Windows GUIs work by starting with a sample program that worked, and carefully mutating and checking for viability each step.  Used SoftICE to debug the hard stuff.  Built a stunningly good system using Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of DCE RPC (the alternative to Sun&#x27;s haphazard stuff).  But as I note the stuff outside of my code kept getting better and better.  Oh, did I say in that last job that MS&#x27;s Visual C++ STL library wasn&#x27;t thread safe?  On a naively multi-threaded system, that I used with 2 CPUs until 2002?<p>Bleah.  You&#x27;ve learned a lot of stuff, but the price sounds like it&#x27;s too high unless you&#x27;re going to continue in this ecosystem, and I&#x27;m advising all my friends to leave it.  Especially with the new CEO, who very possibly has serious damaged its existing QA system without replacing it with something better (rather like one of the causes of the 2nd part of the Vista nightmare).<p>And, yeah, SQL is <i>GREAT</i>.  Just helped a friend with a project using PostgreSQL ... and its doc is great, like IBM&#x27;s for Windows and UNIX(TM) back then, and Oracle&#x27;s in the 1994-2001 time frame.

I&#x27;m right about that.<p>You are, but my argument is, even if HSTS reaches 100% adoption, we <i>still</i> need something else.<p>>  That would be a crazy plan if DNSSEC did something to solve the CA problem. It doesn&#x27;t. It adds a 1483rd CA to the trust model that is heavily influenced by NSA.<p>It&#x27;s naïve to think the NSA don&#x27;t already have keys to a whole bunch of trusted CAs. The NSA are irrelevant to this discussion. When it comes to rogue CAs or system compromise however, having 1 CA to trust is better than X hundred. And, iirc, current browsers rightly ignore HSTS/HPKP for self-signed certs without an additional trust anchor (like DNS pinning).<p>Around and around we go, avoiding the key point. It&#x27;s all about who you want to trust.",1421690591

8913033,comment,8911301,8912003,0,0,mraleph,,,"Ok reporting back. There are two issues here.<p>The first major one is related to mortality of TypedArray&#x27;s maps (aka hidden classes). When typed array stored in the Data variable is GCed and there are no other Uint8Array in the heap then its hidden class is GCed too. This also causes GC to find and discard all optimized code that is specialized for Uint8Array&#x27;s and clear all type feedback related to Uint8Array&#x27;s from inline caches. When we later come and reoptimize - optimizing compiler thinks that cleared type feedback means we need to emit a generic access through the IC (there is reasoning behind that) because this is potentially going to be a polymorphic access anyways. I have filed the issue[1] for the root cause (mortality of typed array&#x27;s hidden class).<p>Now there is a second much smaller issue (which also explains performance of the Buffer case) - apparently there were some changes in the optimization thresholds and OSR heuristics. After these changes we hit OSR at a different moment: e.g. I can see that we hit inner loop one that loops over `j` instead of hitting outer loop which leads to better code. In V8 OSR is implemented in a way that tries to produce optimized code that is both suitable for OSR and as a normal function code - this is done by adding a special OSR entry block that jumps to the preheader of the selected loop we are targeting with the OSR. This allows V8 to reuse the same optimized code without optimizing it again for the normal entry - but this also leads to code quality issues if OSR does not hit the outer loop because OSR entry block inhibits code motion. This is a know problem and there are plans to fix it. The hit usually is quite small unless you have very tight nested loops (like in this case).<p>Disabling OSR (--nouse-osr) not only &quot;solves&quot; the second issue but it also partially fixes (hides)the first issue: 1) we no longer optimize with partial type feedback - so we never emit generic keyed access but always specialize it for the typed array 2) we no longer emit OSR entry - hence no code quality issues related to it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=3824"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=3824</a>",1421690416

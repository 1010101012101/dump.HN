The vast majority of software is written for businesses and runs either on an intranet or is available on the internet to the users of that business.<p>For every public app you know about that needs to scale there are a hundred you don't know about that don't need to scale.  Most programmers work on systems that will never need to scale, EVER.  It is a tiny tiny minority of programmers that actually work on systems that become publicly popular on the Internet and actually face scaling issues.<p>Secondly, we're talking about programmers here, not the software, most email systems use <i>existing</i> mail software written by that tiny tiny minority of programmers who write such systems.  The vast majority of programmers will <i>NEVER</i> write a mail system, a chat system, or anything that handles large volumes of data or users.  Most of them of doing one thing, biz apps for in house projects at big and small companies exposing relational data to in house users.<p>How many IM networks are there? Now how many programmers are there?  I'll say it again, most software does not need to scale.  Because a lot of software does need to scale does not make that statement in any way false because a shit load more doesn't need to scale.",1229720003

Most people will never get to this level and the article is probably written for people that won't have to deal with this.<p>So, at a certain level, you need to optimize your code to shard data, avoid joins, etc. because you simply can't throw hardware at it.<p>Most people will never get to that level so throwing hardware at the problem is often the answer, but if you have a lot of quadratic algorithms in your code, you're going to hit scaling problems that will make throwing money at it expensive to the point where you'll loose money.",1229718634

Enter the We Media Pitch It Challenge. If you’re a finalist you’ll pitch your idea live at We Media Miami (February 24-26, 2009) before the leaders, innovators and investors of the connected society. A panel of judges will select the two best ideas - one commercial, one non-profit. We’ll invest up to $25,000 in each to help them turn the idea into reality. We’ve partnered with Ashoka’s Changemakers, a global network of social entrepreneurs, to help us select the finalists.<p>Hurry! The entry deadline is January 21, 2009.<p>To enter the challenge, visit http://www.changemakers.net/en-us/competition/powerofus.<p>2.

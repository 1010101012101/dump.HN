6960611,comment,6959332,6960202,1,0,dkokelley,,,"I agree with your point, although I think you miss the author&#x27;s point slightly. In our personal lives, the choice to buy the cheap analog version of things is still an option, while those of us with access to technology can leverage it in a way that makes our lives easier. This &quot;widens the gap&quot; between the haves and have-nots. At the same time, as technology advances, tools and services that the poor relied on (e.g. payphones, print newspapers, and coin-operated parking meters) are declining in availability. There is an ever-increasing pressure on people to adopt new technology, and those who can&#x27;t afford to must find ways to work around these limits.<p>In a way, we already live in the world described in the article. Imagine the impact on cars when they first arrived. &quot;The wealthy can afford to take jobs farther away, while the poor are limited to work only as far as they can walk!&quot; Having the perspective of a century of progress, I can tell you the impact, and I doubt many would argue that automobiles are a net loss to society. Unfortunately it sometimes seems like the only equitable solution is to restrict the use of technology so that those without it are not too disadvantaged (i.e. &quot;If we limit cars to walking speed, everyone will have the same job opportunities&quot;).",1387911391

Google are based in Italy.<p>There is a small Google there, but they are satellite, not headquarters.  (I assume.  Perhaps Italy is in the top couple percent and actually does significant things other than sales, then substitute another country here.)<p>>But what&#x27;s happening is the national sales people are closing deals but then book those ads through a different legal entity in Ireland, even though the sale happened with a local sales person, in a local company. This is with the express purpose of avoiding tax and claiming it was &#x27;only following the law&#x27;, when it is clearly deliberately avoiding tax.<p>Are you arguing that there is something unethical/immoral/unfair about a big company paying a small local one to sell ads on behalf of the big company?  I guess I&#x27;ll just have to disagree if so.  I see no reason the price of the ads should be counted as revenue for the local company.<p>Right now Google is funneling all the money through one country because it has the lowest taxes.  Even if they stopped using loopholes, I don&#x27;t see why they would stop selling from the country with the best tax rates.  So Google Italy, Google France, etc. would not still book the ads.",1387911342

And the deeper problem is that every country would like to shift its tax burdens to &quot;big multinationals&quot; but there are tax and trade agreements to impose some fairness and order.<p>If an advertising company really were running some of their operation from Italy, they should certainly pay tax there (and not, say, in Ireland).

A lot of the Ruby on Rails architecture concepts were very useful in figuring out how to architect my iOS application.

I also feel a lot more comfortable picking up JavaScript frameworks, such as Backbone.js and Angular.js, which were harder for me to understand and pick up when I was just doing Rails.<p>Next up, I&#x27;ll be learning a little bit of Android development, hoping to learn the different philosophies for mobile and how to better structure my layouts for different devices, and will probably learn a bunch of other things I can&#x27;t even think of right now!<p>Working with amazing engineers who are open to mentoring me has also been priceless.",1387910469

Sometimes they even arrive at the complete opposite (and equally incorrect) position that copyright and revenue from it is completely unimportant.<p>I can only assume that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here, given that nothing I&#x27;ve proposed would reasonably prompt your questions.<p>I suppose I&#x27;ll respond anyway, though:<p>> How much are you willing do distort the rest of your society in order to support one relatively minor, if wealthy, group of people?<p>Wealthy? I suppose there are some pop acts that make it so big that they become pretty wealthy. These are indeed folks (like Iron Maiden) that could continue to enjoy good business even without much recording revenue at all, but they&#x27;re no more a representative sample for the sake of discussion here than most hackers are (or ever will be) Mark Zuckerberg wealthy.<p>As it happens, I am willing to distort society a <i>little</i>, in much the same way that the original copyright bargain does, for the same reasons. I think that the norm should remain that recordings are something people should pay for. That&#x27;s it. No need for SOPA or DRM required everywhere by law or million dollar fines for vigorously prosecuted individual violations. Piracy still exists, and may even be often treated as discussed in the article, but people who do it know it for what it is and that the approved (and supportive) way to participate in getting recordings is to either purchase or download from where they&#x27;re explicitly free.<p>Probably wouldn&#x27;t do terrible damage to other &quot;more important&quot; industries.",1387909972

It is, however a low-level programming language not much different from assembly.<p>The reason it is that it operates on concepts that are not abstract but are of register machines.  A high completely abstracts underlying architecture so the code can be executed in any possible environment by means of translation, be it a $10MM Cray or a cellular automaton or a mechanical computer.  In essence, a high level language provides an abstract notation for computation.<p>C, however, is not abstract at all.  Variables?  How those will map to a dataflow computation?  Pointers?  Would not work beyond register CPUs (e.g. it is very cumbersome to translate C programs to Javascript as a result and usually leads to a memory array emulation).  Fixed-width types?  Volatile pointers?  Returns from the middle of a procedure?  Gotos?  Come on, how those are even going to run on a non-conventional architecture?<p>C also does not completely define the language semantics leaving certain operations implementation-specific or undefined.  It also (before C11) didn&#x27;t define any memory model, thus making it impossible to even describe an algorithm that depends on specific properties of memory accesses in a way that will be portable across different register machines.  C algorithms are close to impossible to translate to be run on memory-less computation devices as the whole concept of C is based around having local memory and a stack space with certain properties (unless one wants to emulate a register machine, see JavaScript remark above).<p>In certain areas it lead to some ugly solutions like Cuda where the language looks like C but semantics is completely different and GPUs are the closest thing to he original C target as you can get.",1387909112

Try to keep functions as simple as possible and to do one task per function, no more. Then message errors are not that hard to figure out, although yes, I agree that for example in Java errors are easier to figure out (but definitely not fixing them...). And anyway using the REPL you can test one function at a time, given it&#x27;s a pure function, which is also a new state of mind: eliminate all possible mutable state.<p>I&#x27;ve found that when using Clojure you have to think in a different way about the problems to be able to &quot;see&quot; how your problem can be resolved in Clojure in a more elegant and concise way.

Honestly 99% of string stuff I do is using a C++ library that keeps track of the allocation size (and also has small-string optimization.)<p>What I came up with in place of strlcpy/cat, which worked better for my own purposes, is below, which I call strmcpy/cat:<p><pre><code>  //return = strlen(target)\n  unsigned strmcpy(char *target, const char *source, unsigned length) {\n    const char *origin = target;\n    if(length) { while(*source && --length) *target++ = *source++; *target = 0; }\n    return target - origin;\n  }\n\n  //return = strlen(target)\n  unsigned strmcat(char *target, const char *source, unsigned length) {\n    const char *origin = target;\n    while(*target && length) target++, length--;\n    return (target - origin) + strmcpy(target, source, length);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nTruncation is detected by seeing if source[strmcpy/cat(...)] != 0, and very easy to wrap with another function. And in general, I find strcat functions kind of unpleasant (eg Schlemel the painter), so for that a strpcpy() that writes to a pointer will let you chain those, eg:<p><pre><code>  void strpcpy(char *&target, const char *source, unsigned &length) {\n    unsigned offset = strmcpy(target, source, length);\n    target += offset, length -= offset;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow I am sure you can point out a myriad of serious problems with these functions, just as I have for strlcpy/cat.<p>Hell they&#x27;re probably much worse than strl, but they work for me at least. If nothing else, they are at least easier to read =)<p>Full info on these functions is at the bottom of this dead article: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130121234920/http://byuu.org/articles/programming/strcpycat\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://web.archive.org/web/20130121234920/http://byuu.org/ar...</a>",1387908503

I agree that increasing power <i>should</i> be treated with great scepticism (But it isn&#x27;t, honestly. And that&#x27;s a shame).<p>Point: Police power is inherently a use of force on the citizenry. The Army is the same, loooosely.<p>Point: Taxing, coining, patenting are all applications of force.<p>Point: The 5th amendment clearly lines out uses of force.<p>Point: The 5th amendment also includes a key phrase, &quot;due process of law&quot;, indicating that the government is limited. The 3rd amedment supports this as well, requiring a limitation on quartering in time of war via law.<p>Point: Law & regulations, period, are the application of the government&#x27;s use of force to ensure a smooth governing (See Hobbes for a work known in the late 1700s).<p>Conclusion: The US founders designed the government to have power (Unverified statement based on recollections - <i>but</i> split in such a way that each arm of government was naturally incented to limit the power of the other arms).<p>Nit: The US is a republic, not a democracy.

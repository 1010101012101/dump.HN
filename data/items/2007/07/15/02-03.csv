So you tell me: if it makes them more money, and they haven't said they won't do it, what will they do?<p>This kind of comment is at least as misleading as a self-professed speculative article it is reponding to.<p>P.S. Which do you work for - Google or Pownce?",1184468202

But only <i>bad</i> design will get a reaction.  People expect websites to work, and to let them easily do what they set out to do.  Nobody compliments designers for building websites that don't get in their way.  But oftentimes the best compliment for a designer is to be unnoticed.",1184467035

My boss remarked about this to me - in the past, enterprise tools have been far ahead of the consumer apps technologically.  Software features that made it to home PCs in the mid-90s were available on enterprise workstations in the early 80s, and in some cases the consumer market <i>still</i> hasn't caught up (take a look at early Lisp Machines for an example of what was possible then).  Nowadays, it seems like Google and Yahoo have locked up many of the best developers, and the features that come out of Google/Yahoo!Finance often are <i>better</i> than the equivalent features from, say, Bloomberg.<p>I'm not really sure what this means for the enterprise market.  Probably not good.",1184466804

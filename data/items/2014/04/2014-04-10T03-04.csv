7564044,comment,7559915,7559915,12,0,lkrubner,,,"Erlang is more than a language, it is a philosophy, and the language is merely an expression of that philosophy. I strongly recommend that everyone read &quot;Making reliable distributed systems in the presence of software errors&quot;. This is where Joe Armstrong describes the ideas that fed into the creation of Erlang. I learned a great deal from it:<p><a href=""http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf</a><p>A few quotes:<p>-------------------<p>The central problem addressed by this thesis is the problem of constructing reliable systems from programs which may themselves contain errors. Constructing such systems imposes a number of requirements on any programming language that is to be used for the construction. I discuss these language requirements, and show how they are satisfied by Erlang…<p>History:<p>1998 — Ericsson delivered the first AXD301. The AXD301 is the subject of one of our case studies in Chapter 8. At the time of writing (2003) the AXD301 has over 1.7 million lines of Erlang code which probably makes it the largest system ever to be written in a functional style of programming.<p>…Telephone exchanges are expected to be extremely reliable: Typically having less than two hours of down-time in 40 years<p>…We organise the software into a hierarchy of tasks that the system has to perform. Each task corresponds to the achievement of a number of goals. The software for a given task has to try and achieve the goals associated with the task.<p>Tasks are ordered by complexity. The top level task is the most complex, when all the goals in the top level task can be achieved then the system should function perfectly. Lower level tasks should still allow the system to function in an acceptable manner, though it may offer a reduced level of service.<p>Programming a hierarchy of tasks needs a strong encapsulation method. We need strong encapsulation for error isolation. We want to stop programming errors in one part of the system adversely affecting software in other parts of the system.<p>The essential problem that must be solved in making a fault-tolerant software system is therefore that of fault-isolation. Different programmers will write different modules, some modules will be correct, others will have errors. We do not want the errors in one module to adversely affect the behaviour of a module which does not have any errors.<p>…Our applications are structured using large numbers of communicating parallel processes. We take this approach because [it] provides an architectural infrastructure — we can organize our system as a set of communicating processes. By enumerating all the processes in our system, and defining the message passing channels between the processes we can conveniently partition the system into a number of well-defined sub-components which can be independently implemented, and tested.<p>Concurrent processes with no data sharing provide a strong measure of fault isolation. A software error in a concurrent process should not influence processing in the other processes in the system.<p>…In our system concurrency plays a central role, so much so that I have coined the term Concurrency Oriented Programming to distinguish this style of programming from other programming styles.<p>In Concurrency Oriented Programming the concurrent structure of the program should follow the concurrent structure of the application. It is particularly suited to programming applications which model or interact with the real world.<p>Concurrency Oriented Programming also provides the two major advantages commonly associated with object-oriented programming. These are polymorphism and the use of defined protocols having the same message passing interface between instances of different process types.<p>…In the real world sequential activities are a rarity. As we walk down the street we would be very surprised to find only one thing happening, we expect to encounter many simultaneous events. If we did not have the ability to analyze and predict the outcome of many simultaneous events we would live in great danger, and tasks like driving a car would be impossible. The fact that we can do things which require processing massive amounts of parallel information suggests that we are equipped with perceptual mechanisms which allow us to intuitively understand concurrency without consciously thinking about it.<p>When it comes to computer programming things suddenly become inverted. Programming a sequential chain of activities is viewed the norm , and in some sense is thought of as being easy, whereas programming collections of concurrent activities is avoided as much as possible, and is generally perceived as being difficult.<p>I believe that this is due to the poor support which is provided for concurrency in virtually all conventional programming languages. The vast majority of programming languages are essentially sequential; any concurrency in the language is provided by the underlying operating system, and not by the programming language.<p>The inability to isolate software components from each other is the main reason why many popular programming languages cannot be used for making robust system software.<p>…”It is essential for security to be able to isolate mistrusting programs from one another, and to protect the host platform from such programs. Isolation is difficult in object-oriented systems because objects can easily become aliased. (An aliased object is one where at least two other objects hold a reference to it.)” — Bryce<p>Bryce goes on to say that object aliasing is difficult if not impossible to detect in practice, and recommends the use of protection domains (akin to OS processes) to solve this problem.<p>…In a paper on Java Czajkowski, and Dayn`es, from Sun Microsystems, write:<p>“The only safe way to execute multiple applications, written in the Java programming language, on the same computer is to use a separate JVM for each of them, and to execute each JVM in a separate OS process. This introduces various inefficiencies in resource utilization, which downgrades performance, scalability, and application startup time. The benefits the language can offer are thus reduced mainly to portability and improved programmer productivity. Granted these are important, but the full potential of language-provided safety is not realized. Instead there exists a curious distinction between “language safety,” and “real safety”. ”<p>In this paper they introduce the MVM (an extension to the JVM) where their goal is:<p>… to turn the JVM into an execution environment akin to an OS. In particular, the abstraction of a process, offered by modern OSes, is the role model in terms of features; isolation from other computations, resources accountability and control, and ease of termination and resource reclamation.<p>To achieve this they conclude that:<p>… tasks cannot directly share objects, and that the only way for tasks to communicate is to use standard, copying communication mechanisms, …<p>…Many of the features of the Tandem computer bear a striking similarity to the design principles in the OTP system, and to the fundamental principles of Concurrency Oriented Programming which where discussed earlier.<p>Here are two quotes from the paper, firstly the design principles on page 15<p>There is considerable controversy about how to modularize software. Starting with Burroughs’ Espol and continuing through languages like Mesa and Ada, compiler writers have assumed perfect hardware and contended that they can provide good isolation through static compile-time type checking. In contrast, operating systems designers have advocated run-time checking combined with the process as the unit of protection and failure.<p>Although compiler checking and exception handling provided by programming languages are real assets, history seems to have favored the run-time checks plus the process approach to fault-containment. It has the virtue of simplicity—if a process or its processor misbehaves, stop it. The process provides a clean unit of modularity, service, fault containment and failure.<p>More modern work with object-oriented systems has also recognised the importance of isolating software components from each other. In [21] Bryce and Razafimahefa argue that is is essential to isolate programs from one another, and from the programs which run in the host operating system. This, they consider, is the essential characteristic that any object system must have. As they point out in their paper, this is a difficult problem in an object-oriented context.",1397101429
7564043,comment,7561767,7562156,2,0,mbesto,,,"Background: I grew up in the midwest, lived in London, and now live in SV.<p>Here&#x27;s my 2c. The average person in SV is on their 4-5th startup (whether started or early employee), as compared to the 1st-3rd elsewhere (YMMV). Think of it this way - instead of BigCo wasting away money on a new product launch (good example - Microsoft Kin), there&#x27;s loads of money being poured into 100&#x27;s of Kin-like products, and only very few emerge victorious. This is only possible because of the massive amount of recycled money in tech startups.<p>The rationalization of failure in SV has less to do with commercial progress and more about sociological factors. In other words, there is a huge support network of people who have experienced failures, so it eases the pain of it happening to you. Think about going to an AA meeting where there are 100 recovering alcoholics vs one that has 5. The one with the 100 makes it much easier to recover. You get a large pool of like-minded people and can create allegiances/relationships with much more variety. Want to find someone who also failed a Fitness Tech wearable company in Chicago? Good luck. In SV? There&#x27;s probably one living down the street from you.<p>Lastly, there is a fair share of fakers here. Number wise, more than anywhere else, but relative to the successes, it&#x27;s no different than anywhere else. People can hustle their way into the industry with little effort. People rarely check backgrounds here, and there is a winner take all attitude (integrated with a passive, pay-it-forward mentality).<p>> <i>What is worse is that breaking into the funding market is rather difficult unless you have a success story under your belt.</i><p>This is slightly a myth. One thing that <i>is</i> preached here and does bode well, is that traction matters. If you can build something (that people want), get traction (prove they want it), then there is more than enough money floating around to get funding. Is it easier to get funding once you&#x27;ve proven yourself in the Valley? Absolutely. But you&#x27;d be surprised to find that funding isn&#x27;t everything here.",1397101429

The applications of scientific discoveries are nowhere to be seen in politics, economics, or law.<p>Starting in WWI, and ending with the Cold War, was the era of institutional science. During these times, scientists were respected and their input considered at every level of government. Yet, once the Cold War ended, it was back to business as usual. Science funding was cut, and scientists were exiled back to the lab, and replaced with financiers.<p>The MMR/autism zealots are a small blip in a much larger, metastasizing sickness in western society. Scientists, who are experts in the empirical rationalism which made the west what is today, are now marginalized and discredited as advisors to the public.<p>You reap what you sow. As NIH and NSF funding is cut, and STEM grads fight for dwindling employment opportunities, cases like this will become more and more common.<p>A society without science at its foundation is doomed to struggle in the dark forever.

7563992,comment,7561121,7563240,3,0,roryokane,,,"3. Wrap, and use a good editor<p>Many editors don’t fully support soft wrapping, sadly. But if you’re lucky enough to use an editor that includes the necessary features, there are no problems with soft wrapping. Soft wrapping has the advantage that you never have to manually re-wrap a line. These editor features make soft wrapping useable:<p>Display noneditable symbols at wrap points to mark them as nonimportant linebreaks. In Vim, `set showbreak=->` to display “->” at wrapped lines. Emacs supports putting arrow symbols in the “fringe”. Visual Studio has a preference to enable this.<p>Indent wrapped lines at the same indentation as the start of the line, optionally plus extra indentation. Vim does not support this but there is a patch for Vim that makes this enable-able with `set breakindent`. Coda supports it fully, with customizable extra indentation. This is the least-supported, most-important feature of making wrapping useable.<p>Separate logical-line movement and visual-line movement. Pretty much every editor supports this. Logical-line movement is really only necessary in macros, anyway. In Vim, it’s j/k (or -/<Enter>) vs gj/gk. In Sublime Text, it’s up/down vs option-up/option-down (or some combination like that).",1397100216

This includes the biggest treatment trial ever undertaken on oseltamivir that on its own included just over 1,400 people of all ages,” noted Jefferson. &quot;We are concerned that these data remain unavailable for scrutiny by the scientific community.&quot;<p>Following a public pledge by the manufacturer of oseltamivir, Roche, to make full study reports available to scientific investigators, the Cochrane team decided to focus instead on manufacturers’ clinical study reports (typically submitted to regulators) and regulators’ comments. They called reports and comments “regulatory information”. Availability of documents generated by national and regional regulatory bodies during licensing processes in the UK, USA, continental Europe and Japan, along with partial trial reports from the manufacturer of oseltamivir, Roche, and from the European regulator European Medicines Agency (EMA), enabled the researchers to verify information from the trials.<p>When the team compared published data with the more complete unpublished trial records, they found apparent inaccuracies in the published record of the trials. For example, while unpublished trial reports mentioned serious adverse events (some even classified as possibly related to oseltamivir), one of the two most cited publications makes no mention of such effects, and the other states “... there were no drug-related serious adverse events”.<p>Having pieced together information from more than 16,000 pages of clinical trial data and documents used in the process of licensing oseltamivir, the Cochrane team raises critical questions about how well the drug works, as well as about its reported safety profile. While the drug did reduce the time to first alleviation of symptoms by an average of 21 hours, it did not reduce the number of people who went on to need hospital treatment. Results from the reanalysis of data also raise questions about how the drug works as an influenza virus inhibitor.&quot;",1397100098

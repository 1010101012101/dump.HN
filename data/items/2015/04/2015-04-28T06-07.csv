It&#x27;s frightening.</i><p>It is a joke.<p>Idiocracy relies on the assumption that the &quot;more intelligent&quot; people are snobs and too busy and too perfectionist with their life to have children, while the &quot;less intelligent&quot; people are mostly having sex and are too lazy to apply contraception properly.<p>Essentially, the first half of the movie is a justification for elitism.<p>I&#x27;m less afraid of Idiocracy to become true, but more afraid of politicians acting as if they believed in this movie.<p>The second half of this movie is more interesting, though. It may be interpreted as an analogy of how the most gifted people (in the sense of &quot;intellectual giftedness&quot;) may feel living in today&#x27;s world. (by putting today&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; people into a dumb world)  But even that is, of course, a funny hyperbole, and nothing to take too seriously.",1430204336
9450817,comment,9450815,9450815,0,0,lazyeye,,,"For the ultimate in &quot;dark pattern&quot; user interface design check out the unbelievably awkward interface for removing your history from Google.<p><a href=""http://history.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://history.google.com/</a><p>1. Initially the history page asks you just to stop your search browser history.
   Most people would assume that this is all required but this doesnt delete your previous search history which has to be manually removed via a very clunky process by Google standards. This is all hidden away through several levels of menu.<p>2. There is no single click button to delete all your history<p>3. You have to individually remove your history from each of the following sections (hidden by default until you click on a button) -> Location history, Device state history, Voice search history, Video search history, Videos watched history.<p>4. You have to turn off history recording for all the sections individually and then manually remove the existing prior history on top of this (not obvious).<p>5. Even for each of the history sections, you cannot globally delete with one click, you have to delete one page at a item (20 items to a page).
   This means to delete a couple of years retained data your looking at 50 actions or so.<p>Again how easy would it be to make a button that stops all recording and deletes all history?",1430204319

I&#x27;d much rather have a single, small, and yet still powerful piece of software like Redis, and if Disque can be that without the performance issues introduced by mapping a message queue over Redis, that seems to be a huge gain.<p>This is different enough from Redis that I don&#x27;t see how they directly compete.

9450791,comment,9449167,9450639,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Good grief you guys. How many films do you think make that kind of money? Billion dollar film franchises happen about as often as billion dollar startups - often enough to be something you might get lucky with, but the odds of that happening for you are staggeringly low. And even then, those films have as much or more spent on advertising as on the production, which is part of why it&#x27;s such a high-risk business and major studio offerings are so conservative in terms of storytelling, casting etc..<p>A prepay model is what we have now. The largest 6 studios  have the resources to open a film globally if they really want to (eg this will probably happen with the new Star Wars movie, and most likely the new Avengers one coming out in a few days), but generally international distributors sign contracts to buy a film in advance at a certain price and those are used as collateral in obtaining financing, but this model is falling apart under pressures from piracy, Netflix, and other factors.<p>If you mean prepay as in Kickstarter, that model doesn&#x27;t work for features. Well, I should qualify a little - it can work for feature documentaries, because there is an existing community for many interests and people are very interested in seeing their pet interest/issue treated in movie form, without being too picky on quality. And of course it works well if you have  a book or a comic or an unfashionable old TV show or something that has a small number of very dedicated fans, eg the <i>Veronica Mars</i> project last year, or fans of a particular actor. I call these &#x27;fanservice&#x27; films - they&#x27;re basically franchise properties, but franchises too small for Hollywood to care about. You can also get some mileage out of community fanservice, eg if your story appeals to people of an under-represented demographic like people from a particular country, LGBT people, or similar.<p>But if you just want to make an ordinary narrative film pitched at a broad audience - a drama, thriller, whatever - it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Dig through the major (and some minor) crowdfunding sites, and you see hardly any feature projects meet their funding targets. This should (I hope) change a bit later this year or early next, when the SEC finally opens up the possibility of crowdfunding <i>equity</i> under title III of the JOBS act, because while the risk is high at least there&#x27;s an incentive to invest, whereas under existing crowdfunding models you have to come up with a mix of merchandising swag (which is not free to provide) and weird high-ticket rewards like getting a hot air balloon trip with the lead actor or something to land a couple of big donations.",1430203660

I find that the only people who parrot it are those who have never been on the other end of the table. I&#x27;ve seen random people run over and advise a witness to &quot;not talk to the police&quot; while they were describing what happened to an officer at the scene of an accident. You can&#x27;t package deeper context with something simple like &quot;don&#x27;t talk to the cops&quot; and expect people to understand it. I think this general advice does more harm than good because of the way it&#x27;s delivered.<p>The correct conclusion to come away with from the advice is to be vigilant when interacting with those who have the power to prosecute you, and often that means invoking your right to remain silent -- but not always. You should also know when you need a lawyer -- again, not always. If the cops knock on your door because they&#x27;re looking for a lost kid, calm down and get over yourself, they&#x27;re not looking for you.<p>Sadly, you and me get that, but others take the advice to the extreme and I&#x27;ve seen both of my examples firsthand.",1430202434

The EU Parliament (elected), the Commission (periodically nominated by national governments) and the Council (meeting of national governments) are the three &quot;heads&quot; of the EU political system, and they are locked in a constant struggle to determine the exact boundaries of their powers. The Parliament is the youngest institution, hence the historical disregard of entrenched interests; at the same time, it&#x27;s the institution most hungry for power, because it&#x27;s the only one with a clear democratic mandate.<p>As others mentioned, software patents were a battlefield for such struggle: the Commission repeatedly recommended their introduction (IIRC, at the behest of a certain Microsoft-friendly Irish commissioner), and the Parliament repeatedly sent them packing. You will find several other instances of this happening: the democratic mandate of the EU Parliament in most cases will eventually trump backroom agreements in the Commission, as long as the topic becomes mainstream enough to invoke such mandate.<p>In future, the institution that is destined to become more and more powerless is one between the Council and the Commission, since their scope overlaps now that the Parliament has taken over the &quot;legislative&quot; process earlier left to the Commission.",1430201826

For example, what is the probability of observing the features of a given trace had it come from the suspect versus had it come from another individual in the relevant population.<p>The concept of &quot;matching&quot; is also slightly more complicated in reality. Basically you have to account for uncertainty in measurements and other factors. For example, often you won&#x27;t get a perfect print from a crime scene but a smudged partial mark, which you then compare to an inked fingerprint. 
Studies about the validity and reliability of fingermark-to-fingerprint comparison that are based on fingerprint databases of inked fingerprints most likely overstate the accuracy of the method as compared to testing under conditions of real casework.<p>For some additional background on problems with fingerprints in forensics see:<p>National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Institute of Justice, February 2012 report: &quot;Latent Print Examination and Human Factors: Improving the Practice through a Systems Approach&quot; (<a href=""http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=910745"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id...</a>)<p>Edit: See this paper for a recent example of academic work in forensic statistics (I&#x27;m not affiliated with the work/authors etc.) : <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08234v1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08234v1</a><p>Edit2: fixed link",1430201749

If you&#x27;re producer of one of the top 50 or so films, yes people are shoving money at you. In the top 100, you probably broke even and people will be shoving money at you when it hits the home video market. In the top 101-200 films, You&#x27;ll most likely make your money back and enjoy a modest profit.<p>Outside of the top 200 films? Then your box office takings were certainly under $1 million (except for about 10 films), and more to the point most people haven&#x27;t heard of your film. Have a look at yearly box office #s on a site like boxofficemojo, and look at some of the other 6-800 films that get a US theatrical release each year. Many good films have box office numbers that are measured in thousands, and remember that box office numbers are <i>gross</i> - as a rule of thumb, only 1/3 of the box office goes back to the distributor, the rest stays in the theater.<p>What you seem to be overlooking here is that while some films do indeed make money hand over fist, for the many more than don&#x27;t, piracy is <i>just as big a problem</i> - not because so many people are pirating an obscure or somewhat unpopular film who would otherwise have paid for it (although this is a problem for quite a few films, eg Terry Gilliam&#x27;s last film had dreadful box office because they didn&#x27;t have much money to advertise, but was very popular on file-sharing sites), but because piracy makes it increasingly difficult to come up with any kind of meaningful estimate about a film&#x27;s long-term earning potential. that in turn makes it much harder to raise financing for a film. It&#x27;s definitely tougher than it was 10 years ago when I got into the business.<p><a href=""http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?page=1&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&yr=2014&p=.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?page=1&view=relea...</a>",1430201571

It is even admitted they know nothing about clouds.<p>What surprises me is that the author has the answer: &quot;our carbon dioxide emissions wouldn’t be anything to worry about&quot;.<p>One thing they are right, though, even though they interpret it wrong at some points, it&#x27;s the water, stupid. (Please, bear in mind this is an expression, and I&#x27;m using it as such, not to offend anyone).<p>The temperature regulator power of water lies in its latent heat property, which, for water, is one of the highest there is for evaporation.<p>Honestly, I do not know how many times this has to be repeated, and this alone would put all this &quot;global warming by CO2&quot; nonsense off: the irradiative heat from &quot;thermal (infrared) affected molecules&quot; (I believe the term &quot;greenhouse gases&quot;, apart from conceptually wrong, nowadays is misleading) cannot cause extra heating of the system. That would mean &quot;doubling&quot; the solar energy, thus suggesting &quot;creation of energy&quot;, therefore implying in something like &quot;infinite energy on a loop&quot;. It is like plugging those electric extension powers in itself, or saying that all energy necessary for anything is a candle. It is to say one can melt an iron structure with a candle. Besides, energy always flows from a warmer object towards a colder object.<p>It is that supply of water (almost 3/4 of the planet&#x27;s surface) that allows for optimal life conditions on this planet. And it is water that &quot;regulates&quot; weather, almost like a thermostat.<p>The reflection/absorption argument is also lame. There ain&#x27;t much solar power arriving at the poles anyway for its reflection/absorption to be of significance. Besides, it is only the visible light that is reflected.<p>When snow melts, it is because it is getting hotter anyway (winter to spring to summer). However, when snow is falling it actually gets warmer because of the release of energy in the process. It is water that is absorbing and holding most of the heating the Sun throws at us, thankfully. Without all that water and the atmosphere as well we would be frozen at -387ºF at night.<p>For those still insisting about the power of CO2, I invite them to spend a night in a dry desert.

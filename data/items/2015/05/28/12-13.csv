9617728,comment,9615885,9617670,0,0,linhchi,,,"I post here my 2 cent summary about game theory, if someone needs reference, i can post later:<p>In noncooperative game theory, a player is supposed to be rational and intelligent. Being rational at least means that player doesn&#x27;t use a dominated strategy (like in one-shot PD, cooperation is dominated by defection). Being intelligent means that player can bet in the rationality of opponents (which means one knows that the other will not play a dominated strategy ~ cooperation).<p>-> Just these two conditions can solve the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma. However, in other games, after iterating away all the dominated strategies, player needs a stronger\nnotion of rationality: player maximizes expected utility given accurate prediction about opponent&#x27;s strategy. As before, with the intelligent assumption standing, both players&#x27; keen consistency in their action will lead to Nash equilibrium (NE).<p>NE is a broad and fundamental concept. It&#x27;s broad because it bases only on belief, not necessarily on what&#x27;s real. Given the convergence of action and belief in equilibrium, what wasn&#x27;t justified before will become justified. However, too broad is also its inherent issue because game theory loses its predictive power in many games by dictating too many possible Nash equilibria. Speaking of that, this concept is still so fundamental that it becomes the unit test for any kind of stricter equilibrium concept that one would like to build.<p>-> Many giants have tried to make major refinements built on top of NE. But along this literature, the further they go, the heavier the burden of rationality assumptions on modelling decision makers becomes. Player has to bear an exhaustive rationality in analysing the game in all the nodes that may never happen, or in face of background noise, or in thinking from future back to present.. Even making mistake needs to be justified. That requires ability to do complex optimization and infinite recursive thinking of common knowledge. So they say, what is the point of a theory starting with assumptions about players that are not even close to the statistically real truth? And if the collective reality doesn&#x27;t matter, what matters?<p>-> Until now the narrative has substantially shifted from these ideal players to less demanding subjects. Just\nas applied economics of behavioral, experimental, neuro-economics trying to figure out a reasonable approach\nto modelling decision makers by adding cognitive and psychological knowledge, theorists bring evolution into\ngame theory. Starting from an amusing observation that nature doesn&#x27;t assume any rationality of its creatures\nbut its solution many times becomes our definition of perfect, evolutionary game theory (EGT) offers a less\npervasive way of thinking into games by replacing strict assumptions by adaptive learning and letting the itera-\ntive selection process do its job. Surprisingly, sometimes it gives us the perfect equilibrium just like in the classical regime.",1432817168

No one wants to lose touch, and facebook provides and easy way to make sure that (had I not deleted) when I wanted to go back to Europe I&#x27;d have easy access for communication lines to the individuals I might want to visit.<p>Everything is double edged and while I&#x27;ve enjoyed my time off of facebook (why does everyone have to hate on the poorest in America?

No effort to understand a problem even less \n  effort to understand is there really a problem...\n</code></pre>\nSo people who talk on this topic aren&#x27;t thoughtful? Sure some aren&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s the same for any topic. You&#x27;re cherry picking there, it doesn&#x27;t stick.<p>I&#x27;m currently working in an organisation that specialises in behavioural science, we have the actual data on this. If you look at the studies there&#x27;s overwhelming evidence to support an opinion that these problems are real. Women and different ethnic groups are treated in different ways with regard to things like hiring, performance reviews, etc. and there&#x27;s a significant enough difference that the system could be defined as racist and sexist, even though no individual feels that they themselves are racist or sexist.<p>If you want citations... here are some just relating to the field of gender and employment...<p>Female job applicants with children considered less warm, likeable and committed than male applicants with children. Successful mothers penalized for promotion, hire, and salary (Benard and Correll, 2010). Women expressing anger more penalised than men (Brescoll & Uhlmann, 2008). People in gender-incongruent roles penalised more heavily for mistakes (Brescoll, Dawson, & Uhlmann, 2010). Voluble women perceived as less competent and less suitable leaders, inverse true for men (Brescoll, 2011). Men who work for women in stereotypically male dominated fields accorded less status and lower salaries (Brescoll et al, 2012). Women who succeed in male-dominated fields percieved as not likeable (Heilman et al, 2004). Students question the competence of female teachers who evaluate them negatively, less so than male teachers (Sinclair & Kunda 2000). Female students seen as less competent than identical male students, offered lower starting salaries (Moss-Racusin et al, 2012)<p><pre><code>  ... even some words are taboo the concepts behind them are inaccessible \n  so people are not able to think about them. This results in people not \n  really understanding what racism is...\n</code></pre>\nThis point is broadly right (you have cause and effect inverted), but it doesn&#x27;t just apply to &quot;SJWs&quot; as you&#x27;re implying. People in general don&#x27;t have a vocabulary to talk about racism and sexism. People don&#x27;t typically identify as racists. They think &quot;racists are &#x27;bad people&#x27; and I&#x27;m a &#x27;good person&#x27; so I can&#x27;t be one&quot;, but in fact race is a more complex beast in the 21st century so we need a more complex vocabulary to describe it without triggering defensiveness.<p>Using &#x27;social justice warrior&#x27; as a snarl-word is a sign that you feel defensive and uncomfortable. But that discomfort doesn&#x27;t mean the &#x27;SJWs&#x27; are wrong, it just means we as a species don&#x27;t have a good set of verbal tools to communicate with each other about what&#x27;s happening.<p>I&#x27;d recommend reading this, it&#x27;s long but worth it if you actually care about this topic:\n<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/good-men-project/why-its-so-hard-to-talk-to-white-people-about-racism_b_7183710.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/good-men-project/why-its-so-ha...</a>",1432816221

9617607,comment,9611145,9611145,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"Let me argue in favor of coding problems.  Unpaid coding problems have a couple of very appealing properties:<p>1) They are available to all applicants (not all applicants have github profiles, or can show previous work samples, or are available for short term contracting work).<p>2) They do not cause problems with typical IP agreements or extra curricular work restrictions.<p>3) They can be standardized so all candidates receive the same process.<p>4) They are a closer proxy to the &quot;real work&quot; of development jobs than many other alternatives (and there is lots of research that indicates this leads to better results).<p>Those properties are very important and cannot be found in hardly any other style of hiring filter.  For this reason, its my belief that coding problems are central to a good hiring pipeline.  I believe this so much that I&#x27;m willing to replace nearly every other part of the hiring pipeline with just the programming challenge (though that is a hard sell with management often).<p>The problem with coding problems is that it is very hard to come up with good ones.  They should take less than 4 hours to solve (everyone severely underestimates how long their challenges are), they should be indicative of the kind of work you will you do, and they should be, if not fun, engaging.  So normally when I encounter bad programming problems I chalk it up to that instead of malice.<p>It is everyones decision to not do programming challenges of course, and I completely understand people who will not do them.  But to me the standardized hiring pipeline is the most important part and I&#x27;m willing to lose a few good candidates to get it.  For this reason, I view a programming challenge as a good sign for a potential employer, and the lack of one to be a serious red flag.<p>If someone is using a coding challenge to get free work, that is at the least unethical and likely against the law depending on your jurisdiction.",1432816011

I have many European colleagues who have similar values as Indians. Collective mentality is prevalent in many western societies too. Reason Americans are individualistic is because of foundations of American democracy which glorifies individualism. It&#x27;s not necessarily bad.<p>>It is also corrupted and racist. The thing is, even the victim doesn&#x27;t realise s/he is a victim of racism or sexism and so on.<p>This is rather a naive statement. Victims definitely would realize if something is sexist/racist. They might not be in a position to fix it. India has pretty significant legislation (Prevention of Atrocities Act) protecting minorities. Problem is enforcement.<p>>Like the author said... You&#x27;re reading viewpoint of exactly one woman in tech in India.<p>I could argue the same about the opposite viewpoint derived on a society by reading isolated rape cases or corruption cases in India. I don&#x27;t want to trivialize the problem of rape or corruption but I think it is unreasonable to think that every woman will be raped if she walks alone in India which is what the western media mostly portrays. My undergraduate class in India where I studied engineering had 40% women students. Most laboratory work was in mixed groups. My advisor was a woman. There were 40% woman lecturers. So I am definitely used to seeing women in Engineering. My mother is one too. If you will, this is an observation of society I grew up in.",1432815110

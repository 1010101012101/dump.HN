A car can take getting hit by a drunk driver or wildlife (they fucking jump out of nowhere), a motorcycle can't. I follow the writings of one particular rock drummer who travels extensively by motorcycle, especially on tour, and he wrote--referencing another prominent motorcyclist, who wrote for motorcycling magazines and was at the time recently killed by a deer collision--that the one danger a skilled motorcyclist can never fully mitigate is wildlife. Deer kill plenty of people in cars, too, but you have a better chance surviving having a deer jump on top of your car as opposed to your motorcycle.<p>(I read once that deer kill more people in North America than any other animal.)",1281519414

If you are paying less than $10 an hour, only assign operational/procedural tasks. The incentives in this range are to demonstrate they can ""work quickly"" so that you keep assigning work. Quality suffers<p>2. Expect to pay $500 to $1000 and between 10 and 20 hours of your time ""trying out"" a VA.<p>3. Create a wiki with lists of commonly asked questions / answers / information. Have the VA update this with any question that you ask so that you are only asked questions once. This becomes enormously valuable!<p>4. Ask and give feedback reguarly (what can your VA be doing better, and what can you do better in your business) I've been really suprised by how much insight someone actually dealing with customers email every day has. I changed an entire product line because of this.<p>5. Do not, under any circumstance, have a VA do fulfilment for you. Pay a profesional fulfilment service to do it.",1281518876

And then invest your spare time maintaining a house, which is a better hobby than TV but not for everyone. If you take all that time and money and commitment and invest it in something other than a house, then you can probably rent an apartment and still come out just as rich in the long run.<p>Also, if you rent apartments for 10 years you can spend 10 years moving around to follow opportunities. If you pay a mortgage for 10 years, you can look forward to spending the next 20 paying the same mortgage, and unless you want to pay for housing twice, living in the same place. Standard mortgages are 30 years! That's maybe half of your adult life you have to spend paying interest.

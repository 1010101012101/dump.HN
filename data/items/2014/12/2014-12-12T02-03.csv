I lived around the KS City area for a year and people walking in the middle of the street intentionally obstructing traffic was a thing that happened on a regular basis. They walk in the street while you&#x27;re driving and glare at you, basically trying to prove they can make you do their will by having to drive around them just walking there. Civility is already gone at that point, it is willful, aggressive disruption. Maybe the cop was dickish, but for the same reason you can&#x27;t blame Brown&#x27;s behavior for his homicide, you can&#x27;t blame Wilson for escalation that would make brown figure he could win a confrontation against a law officer.

My ancestors trace back through the paternal line to English speakers for as far back in history as you can go and still find speakers of English. And the last few generations of my family have included college-educated English majors who were very fussy about proper rules of English grammar. But none of that passed on to me in living speech the &quot;correct&quot; (irregular, or &quot;strong&quot;) forms of some of the irregular verbs in English. The attested historical process, as Pinker correctly writes, is that the category of &quot;strong&quot; verbs in English and in other Germanic languages has shrunk over time.<p>For onlookers, I should list here the English irregular verbs. All of you will see for yourselves how rarely used some of them are, and how unlikely it is that a child would learn them from home conversation. Others, of course, the ones we all know, are the ones Pinker thinks will last indefinitely.

</code></pre>
It did inject a function, it&#x27;s right there, in plain text. <i>Then</i> it did type inference. I mean, what else is &quot;lifting&quot; the asterisk to a Function supposed to mean, if not injecting a function around a placeholder? And what about &quot;1 + _ * 2&quot;? What is it lifting? The asterisk? No. It is lifting more than that.<p>> You had a Function[Int,Int] before, but now that you&#x27;ve passed that function value to Array.apply instead of getting an Array[Function[Int,Int]] as you would in every single other case, you get a Function[Int,Array[Int]]?<p>That&#x27;s besides the point. The question is, when the parser sees &quot;_&quot;, how much of the context does it grab along with it? In other words, I know it&#x27;s lifting stuff, what I want to know is <i>how much</i> it lifts. Here&#x27;s another example:<p><pre><code>    f(_, 2)(3)

    ==> x => (f(x, 2)(3)) ?
    ==> (x => f(x, 2))(3) ?
</code></pre>
Scala does the former. That&#x27;s a legitimate choice given common use cases, but the latter is simpler, preserves the invariant that &quot;a(b) <=> (a)(b)&quot; and has use cases as well, e.g. to make an expression like &quot;f(super_long_expression, 2)&quot; more readable.<p>> But not so much as you think. It&#x27;s just the &quot;lift&quot;. Type-inferencing lets you get away with what looks like a little more sometimes.<p>I still don&#x27;t see what type inference has to do with this. The error message makes it clear that the lift is done before type inference kicks in. In a dynamic language, you would stop at the lift, but it would otherwise work just the same.",1418351546

8738306,comment,8737292,8737292,0,0,jqm,,,"I see part of the problem being an extreme lack of civility in our society.<p>At one point I suppose the police felt they were members of the community. So they treated people with some measure of respect and dignity while carrying out their duties. They would see these same people at church, at the store, at baseball games, at funerals etc. So it was different.<p>Now, the police are often unreasonably rude and hostile immediately and without provocation. For example, the case of M. Brown... sure, it&#x27;s understood Brown probably did attack the officer and was shot. But, the officer pulls up squealing tires and shouts for Brown to get the F<i></i>* out of the street. So he gets Brown angry and is physically attacked. Then he _has_ to shoot the kid. Certainly Brown shouldn&#x27;t have been walking in the middle of the road. But what if the officer had pulled up and said &quot;Fellows, how are you doing today? Can I get you to get off the street? I wouldn&#x27;t want to see you get run over.&quot; Then, if they didn&#x27;t comply, ramp it up a little bit at a time as needed. Chances are there never would have been a shooting. But as it is, the officers hostile speech and generally dickish attitude led to a situation in which deadly force eventually was used. That officer is morally in the wrong, he did help create this situation, he should be fired, he should be punished.<p>We should demand our officers act with politeness and basic respect even as they enforce the law. If they can&#x27;t do the job without behaving like psychotic bullies, we should find some people who can.<p>On the other hand, looking at the people they deal with day in and day out, it&#x27;s easy to understand how they could get this attitude. Many citizens officers deal with have no basic respect nor manners themselves. Still... officers should be held the a higher standard (and appropriately compensated if it comes to that). They are still nominally public servants and should be acting in the best interests of the community. A community which includes the people they may be arresting btw.",1418351003

They are commonly used only for fatal errors; I use C++ exceptions for all kinds of things that aren&#x27;t really errors.<p>In C++, one calls a member function by dereferencing a pointer to that function from a table of such pointers.<p>In Objective-C, one calls a &quot;method&quot; by &quot;sending it a message&quot;.  That message is a small snippet of text.  To dispatch to the actual function that implements the method, the Objective-C runtime (libobjc.dylib on OS X and iOS) must match the name of the method that one has targeted, to the name of the method whose implementation is actually just a regular C function.<p>Of course that would be very slow, but the Mach-O executable format is optimized for this case.  Linux ELF and Windows COFF are not.  So while in principle one can use Objective-C on Linux and Windows, the same code will run slower than on an equivalent Mac OS X box or iDevice.<p>Your code can send messages to methods that are not defined at compile time.  If you actually call them you will terminate, but you can provide the implementation later.<p>I think Java can do that as well, but C and C++ do not have first-class language support for such a thing.<p>It&#x27;s most-commonly used for Mac OS X Cocoa and iOS (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch) Cocoa Touch GUI applications, but one can use it for GNUStep on *NIX as well as Cocotron on Windows.",1418350492

Where you place the borders between what you call &quot;English&quot; or &quot;Middle English&quot; or &quot;unnamed branch of Old High Saxon spoken by a particularly small group of villages&quot; is fuzzy, but nobody ever decided &quot;What I was speaking 10 minutes ago was Language A but starting now this is called Language B and they&#x27;re totally different in every way&quot;.<p>So we&#x27;ve been developing English for a very long time. If &quot;little used verbs become regularized over time, but new verbs formed [are] never formed as irregular verbs&quot;, then why do we have still have irregular verbs at all? Why wouldn&#x27;t they have been wiped out thousands of years ago?<p>In the most obvious cases, English hasn&#x27;t changed at a uniform rate. It&#x27;s experienced gradual splits, mergings, conquerings, being alternatingly a vulgar and prestige dialect, immigration, emmigration, wars, trade explosions, and regular old influence of other languages nearby.<p>The claim you&#x27;re quoting seems to be that if a language is left to its own devices that it will gradually approach regularity. I definitely disagree that point, and there are somewhat well-understood methods for these changes it occur even in an isolated language (for instance, vowel shifts that affect some words more than others, after which words that used to follow the same rule no longer do). But let&#x27;s set that aside. Even if we ignore the normal linguistic processes that can increase irregularity in an isolated language, what makes us think that the &quot;artificial&quot; events like wars or interactions with other languages will decrease? Why would those things stop?",1418349660

The point being that children in that age group are no less active today than in the past, so something else is causing obesity, type II diabetes and other problems.<p>The most likely culprit is processed food, where nutrients are not used in their natural form, but instead converted into something else.  So using corn to make high fructose corn syrup, soy and cottonseed to make oil, or feeding animal protein to herbivores are a few examples of where the food supply is getting contaminated.  For example, cottonseed oil is not only a relatively unhealthy oil, but it also contains one of the highest concentration of pesticides (because cotton was not traditionally a food crop).<p>Not to mention that plastics contain hormone-like chemicals like BPA, they use preservatives in things like canned food that don’t need them, and add animal byproducts like pork lard to foods like refried beans that don’t need them.  So our immune systems are getting bombarded by substances we either have no evolutionary history with or simply don’t need to be eating in the quantities that we are.  So that inhibits aspects of our immune systems and metabolism (triggering autoimmune disorders like allergies, asthma, arthritis and metabolic syndrome).<p>I could literally go on forever about this, so the gist of it is “it’s the food supply, stupid”.  Yes, being more active helps a great deal, but without proper nutrition we’re looking at a modern form of the wasting diseases similar to the ones they used to get in the 1800s before they understood vitamins and minerals, except it’s masked by obesity.  I think if we didn’t have the social stigmas around laziness and the political monkeying of the farm and retail lobbies, we would have recognized obesity as an epidemic the way we did with polio and done something about it decades ago.  Nothing short of going back to the foods we ate before about 1980 is going to work for the vast majority of the population.  And that’s going to start with campaigns to inform people about what’s in their food and reform the way we design cities so that food centers are near where people live.<p>TL;DR: They found medical evidence that the western diet disrupts metabolism via pathways other than caloric intake.  Now let’s do something about it.",1418349656
8738234,comment,8737559,8737937,0,0,A_COMPUTER,,,"I agree :-) But I suspect the (correct) distinction you made between the two different motivations for criticism are irrelevant to Hacker School because criticism of any kind is seen as an impediment because some groups find criticism intimidating, and a primary goal of Hacker School is inclusivity and diversity. That is why the conclusion of the essay was to stop being so critical rather than be more judicious about what you criticize. I totally agree with them that there is too much worthless criticism, but what works for them can&#x27;t be a universal prescription. But maybe I&#x27;m reading to much into it.",1418349629

8738231,comment,8736154,8738063,0,0,logicallee,,,"thanks - this was interesting.  Some of the numbers are interesting.  So, for example, he says to have ten million clients updating daily, he would need to sustain 40 MB 116 times every second. . .  that&#x27;s like 37120 megabit so if you pay $10 per megabit monthly, that&#x27;s $371,200 per month.  It&#x27;s pretty bad.  On the other hand you do have ten million users.<p>so the numbers are off, but they&#x27;re not five orders of magnitude off.  If we&#x27;re going to service ten million users, we might have something of a hosting budget for it.<p>So while I believe the author that the current trade-offs aren&#x27;t goods, clever academic mathematics might help in the future.  Cryptography itself came from there.",1418349623

I earned an electrical engineering degree a couple of years ago.  I also collect older texts in my areas of interest.  Using only material from the late-1950s I could have passed my classes.  Using material from the mid-1970&#x27;s, aced them.  (If you are curious, the reason for the difference is the development of the MOSFET.)<p>This is not to say that the material taught was 40 years old.  Rather that 40 years ago the body of core knowledge hit what could be reasonably taught in a four-year time span.  None of this &quot;old&quot; material has been proven wrong (at least at the scales undergrads deal with).

I created a script around this list, which is pulling the newest posts and letting users to vote for them and comment.<p>The idea has to parts:\n(1). A website HN-like list of posts with voting and comments.\n(2). A weekly newsletter [1] with summaries of the best articles from a given week. Most of the posts are very long, and if you are crazy busy (aren’t you?), having weekly summaries allows you to stay on top of the tech stories without spending hours on reading.<p>What do you think?\nOn the bottom of the page there is a link to Suggest a Blogger Form.<p>http://www.TechStarsDigest.com/<p>-----<p>[1] http://webdesigndigest.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9a5d5e2de300c8782ff8758a6&id=90e77955b5",1408974021

The problem is they can&#x27;t figure out how to do it online.<p>There is absolutely no reason why these Universities don&#x27;t offer complete degree&#x27;s online. Many offer a handful of starter/intro courses over correspondence but that&#x27;s about it. They don&#x27;t need to turn into MOOC&#x27;s, they just need to offer quality online education - not 10 year old material. If they offer it, people will take their programs.<p>The only University in Canada doing complete online degrees right now is Athabasca. And some of the material is horridly out of date (COMP 268).

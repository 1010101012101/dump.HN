Top US Journalist Attempting To Reach Israeli Consulate Assassinated - By Sorcha Faal<p>But it&#x27;s an interesting set of dots.

Which does make it about 9 miles from Hastings&#x27; crash site, fwiw.<p>But I&#x27;m more interested in identifying the exact crash location, and the direction he was going. In this article:

I&#x27;m wondering if the car clipped the foreground palm tree, then hit the next tree solidly on the front left of the car. So the car ends up spinning to the right, stopping at 90 deg to the street. This would explain why there&#x27;s little visible damage to the RH side of the car. But not really why the rear damage.<p>If that&#x27;s so, it must have been traveling away from the camera view point. But is that going Nth or Sth?
In either case, it&#x27;s hard to see how that fits with heading to the Israeli consulate.<p>Someone might like to go and see if there&#x27;s any shrapnel damage in the road surface anywhere before the impact point.",1371905828

5923411,comment,5923114,5923302,8,0,georgespencer,,,"I think this belief that form factor comes first or somehow dictates component use is a common misconception (doesn&#x27;t make it a dumb one).<p>Apple believes that design is essentially three things: form factor + hardware inside form factor + software. The three have to play together seamlessly for the overall design to be good. We can debate on how effective they are at this, but that is what Apple believes. Steve Jobs talked about the interplay of hardware and software many times.<p>Steve Jobs also frequently discussed compromises. He believed that consumers paid Apple to make decisions about what was useful and what wasn&#x27;t. So including Flash in iOS would have meant that users could watch all web video (only 25% at launch!), but they looked at the stability and the battery life and made the decision that, no, Flash was not worth it. So Apple believes in tradeoffs.<p>Sometimes these tradeoffs are at the cost of the aesthetic. For example the black plastic on the back of the original iPhone, or the black plastic used on the entire iPhone 3G when they wanted to increase margins and go for market share. This is design. This is a company making tradeoffs.<p>Sometimes the tradeoffs do come to preserve the form factor. I struggle to type on my iPhone, but I was so quick on my BlackBerry that the software lagged behind me. But Apple made the tradeoff.<p>The antennae on the iPhone 4 is a great example of Apple design. It&#x27;s accomplishing so much. It means there&#x27;s no need for black plastic on the device, so the aesthetic is improved. It also provides the structural rigidity for the device, which means they can make it feel super sturdy (love Samsung&#x27;s aesthetic, but if you hold an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy, there&#x27;s a real difference to the feel). That sort of outcome isn&#x27;t the product of a guy in a turtle neck with Auto CAD putting lens flares on everything. That&#x27;s serious design.<p>Jony Ive talked a lot about the process for making the MacBook Air. They wanted to build a fast, ultraportable computer without making it one of those shitty 9&quot; Taiwanese pieces of crap. So they had to work with Intel to build a 60% smaller Merom. Because they didn&#x27;t want to compromise the internal hardware by shipping a slow processor. They had to develop Unibody so they could strip out internal fixtures that would add weight and reduce the structural integrity of the product. Commitment to the aesthetic.<p>You&#x27;ve cited (it&#x27;s cited, btw, not sighted) the iMac. Apple wanted to make it thinner and lighter. At the same time they wanted to ship better components inside it. So they had to keep the space inside the same size or make it bigger, or they weren&#x27;t going to be able to ship the product. So they spent time developing ways to make it thinner and more aesthetically appealing without compromising the hardware components. In this instance I&#x27;d argue that deference to the hardware components came first. Much like the MacBook Air, where so much of the work went into developing a tiny logic board so the device could be full powered.<p>tl;dr Apple makes tradeoffs on behalf of consumers.<p>> Hence why apple makes the products they do<p>A quickie on this: hence why is never correct. Just use hence.",1371905205

5923359,comment,5923114,5923239,12,0,georgespencer,,,"> That&#x27;s pretty much how every Apple product since 1998 was developed.<p>This feels really lazy and borderline trollish.<p>Over the last decade or so Apple (and others!) have fairly consistently demonstrated a belief that design is multifaceted: the form factor, the software, the components inside the form factor.<p>Increasingly we see these intersecting. The form factor for the iPhone is also the hardware: the screen and the antennae. The unibody manufacturing process for MacBook Pro means that the trendy aluminium form of the product also provides its rigidity and reduces the number of components required to hold it together. More room for batteries, which increases the battery life. Apple and Intel worked together to develop a Merom chip 60% smaller than the standard in order to ship the MacBook Air, which was at the time the thinnest notebook around.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t design the form factor and then work out what components need to go inside it. Very often the overall design (form factor + software) is where Apple can innovate, because Apple doesn&#x27;t typically manufacture components, but they frequently make compromises of design in order to accommodate hardware (and vice versa). IR receivers on the original MacBook Pro (horrible black spots on the bezel), the home button on the iPhone (an absence of hardware buttons on the front of the device would be more pleasing). The black plastic at the base of the original iPhone for Wifi (since engineered out by a combination of component and product design).<p>People will look back on the last two or three decades as a renaissance for design. Apple has contributed, but across the board the importance of design -- and by design I mean the aforementioned intersection of form, software, and hardware -- is visible in products from Samsung, Sony, HTC. Heck even Microsoft has realised that design is more than commissioning Brian Eno to write the Windows boot music.<p>Back to the Mac Pro: I&#x27;m sure Apple threw out a dozen designs which had space for more RAM, or which had more CPU sockets, or which had internal expansion. But Apple makes tradeoffs for the overall goal. Sometimes the tradeoffs are such that hardware suffers (I can still type way faster on a BlackBerry than on an iPhone), and some times the aesthetic is diminished (I bet the visible sensors on the iPhone 5 really rankle with Jony Ive). But to suggest that since 1998 Apple has consistently developed the form factor for products first is ludicrous.",1371904124

At the same time it&#x27;s irremediably weaker than (some) currently available PC workstations in terms of CPU, RAM and bandwidth to specialised hardware. Presenting this as a new paradigm of GPU computing seems a bit spinny.<p>EDIT: However, if the Mac Pro (despite the name and the heritage) is really priced and sold as something more like a high-end desktop than a full-blown workstation, then the new-GPU-centric-paradigm thing might be borne out to an extent - it would be an unusually GPU-heavy machine compared to PC desktops, if not to the workstations of VFX professionals.",1371903090

What I don&#x27;t appreciate is guides that focus entirely on how to get women into bed via what is effectively trickery and misogyny. It should be teaching fundamental respect, social awareness, equality, consent, self-appreciation - these are the qualities that will allow you to form lasting connections with people (and not just women). Yeah, these tricks might help you get a drunk girl into bed but she&#x27;ll probably regret it afterwards and so will you!",1371902981

For this reason alone I&#x27;m surprised they went with it rather than supporting USB3 early on or that they didn&#x27;t come up with something similar but altogether new, like they did with Lightning. They seem to be trying to cut down third party kext development, and aren&#x27;t opening the sources for most of their own new kexts. Of course, with IOMMUs available in all Thunderbolt systems, they could have brought back the microkernel aspect of Mach for device drivers, but that would have been even more work.",1371902858

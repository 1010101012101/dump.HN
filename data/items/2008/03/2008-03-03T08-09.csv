I donated $100 back when Mozilla Foundation started up and despite them not even needing the money I still bought plenty of gear from the store. <3 Mozilla.",1204534032

Just because the founders work for free, doesn't mean they contribute the most critical work. ...""</i><p>Owners contribute disproportionately also by their willingness to absorb risk.

127929,comment,127675,127900,0,0,davidw,,,"I think the economic environment <i>has</i> tilted in favor of founders.  Companies don't take care of their employees much any more, so anywhere you go, you risk losing your job for reasons beyond your control.  Sure, as a founder, you are taking bigger risks, but maybe they're not so big these days as compared with working for, say, IBM in the 60ies.",1204533302

127923,comment,127711,127921,0,0,curi,,,"Your approach is to assume the parent is right, and that his rules must be obeyed. This is not a way to find good ways to proceed on any issue.<p>A better approach is to recognize that everyone makes mistakes, and the important thing is to institute policies that correct errors. That means rather than spending all your time making your rules be obeyed by any means necessary, there needs to be mechanism so that if you make a mistake you will be corrected (at least if anyone, including your child, is aware of it). This could be called ""philosophically enlightened parenting"" and it's better because it takes into account what we know about how knowledge is created (including knowledge of what to do in particular situations or how to solve problems in one's life including undesired behavior by one's child). That it doesn't hurt is nice too.",1204532070

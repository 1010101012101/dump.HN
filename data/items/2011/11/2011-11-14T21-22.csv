The history was that with x86 flavored personal computers, there was a 15 year period between 1985 and 2000 where you could take two machines, compare the specs of the ram/processor/video and come up with a 'good, better, best' scale. This made it easy for technology journalists, they could get a press release for the new HP or Toshiba or Alienware PC and say ""this is better than last years/competitor X's/etc model."" Easy sauce. But eventually PCs and laptops got to be good enough so that most people didn't care, it just worked, and having more features was better, or having better features. So the 'specs' or the details of how the manufacturer did, was less important.<p>Why Techcrunch's editors didn't figure this out, oh, 5 or 6 years ago, is anyone's guess.<p>Now it would be great if they would internalize this newfound understanding and stop pumping up OMGWTFBBQ we have PS3 graphics on an ARM chip! Type headlines and instead focus on the people and companies who are using the capabilities of this embarassment of riches to provide new and interesting products. They do some of that of course but so far, for me at least, its not nearly enough relative to this 'specs are dead' stuff.",1321307668

Relying on Disqus, a closed source platform, is not ideal because it slows down page load times, does not contribute to SEO, and it does not let you host and search for comments in your git repo.<p>Some people argue that adding a dynamic commenting system contradicts the static html goal of Jekyll.

After considerable review, the Committee has recommended that we replace Blackboard with Sakai.  The transition will take place over the next two years, with a targeted completion date of September 2013.<p>Peer institutions  including the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Michigan; and Stanford  have had successful and positive experiences with Sakai, as has our own School of Medicine.  And by moving from Blackboard to Sakai, the University moves from a sole-sourced commercial product to an open-source learning management environment that allows us significant say in the softwares development. It also provides an open framework to integrate the other important tools to support teaching, learning, and scholarship, such as Google Apps.  Finally, the University is piloting additional Sakai functionalities, and what we learn from this will inform our next steps.<p>Detailed planning for the transition to Sakai is now underway. The planning process will include broad consultation with the University community by the Teaching Technology Committee, including development of a plan for a smooth and well-supported transition.<p>The University will communicate about additional developments as our efforts progress.  I hope you share our sense of excitement at moving to a new platform that will better serve the teaching and learning process at NYU.",1321307386

Could you make money paying 750 per customer? Our product sold for 2500 so it was worth it.<p>And say you go b2b instead, companies give away their numbers on websites all the time. Can you get to the decision maker in a couple of minutes? Or are there barriers?<p>Overall I just think this article is badly titled and you shouldn't have mentioned adwords <i>at all</i>.

I would argue that the fact that C software works after 20 years is because it's been debugged for 20 years, everything that can possibly happen to it has probably happened and been handled. It's not because error return codes are a fundamentally better way to do this.<p>I know it's kind of unhip right now, but I would argue that what you're asking for is better handled using checked exceptions. That <i>really</i> forces you to think about error conditions, and it's enforced by the language. I'm continuously baffled by the argument that this is a bad idea.",1321304681

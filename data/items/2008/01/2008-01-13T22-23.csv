If you have no taken care of your sleep/stimulant/nap issues, I wouldn't even start on your concentration and productivity issues.<p>For me, that means 8 hours of sleep and often a 10 minute nap after lunch. Once I have that down, and interesting problem can keep me going 8-10 straight.",1200264500

97985,comment,97829,97829,0,0,tjr,,,"I've done a variety of jobs, from classic intro-job retail to working in a computer tape library to scoring essays to teaching to, yes, actually, programming.  :-)<p>In my experience, programming is perhaps the hardest of the lot to do consistently, all day, day in, day out.  Some days I manage to really get into ""hack mode"" and crank out lots of good code.  Other days I can barely focus and don't actually produce much.  I really think a lot of it is the cubicle, etc., environment, as my days spent programming in an office were generally better than being in a cubicle.<p>Either way, I had no problem working and staying on task while sorting computer tapes.  But serious programming requires a particular state of mind and deep understanding of the problem at hand.  The harder it is to achieve that each day, the harder it is to be productive as a programmer.",1200264118

Or more accurately, hasn't adapted for web pages evaluation yet.<p>My guess is that we use, to judge web pages, a sense of beauty that we developed for static graphic arts: painting, typography, advertising etc. It fails to take key points into account: a site's dynamic nature, its complex structure, its usability. My usual experience is that many sites which look shiny on screenshots are a PITA to actually use.",1200263407

From the Wikipedia article: <i>""when one finds a black raven, it is a much more important discovery than finding a non-black object simply because there are fewer black ravens than everything else""</i><p>Finding a black raven yields evidence that all ravens are black.<p>Finding a green apple also yields evidence that all ravens are black, but <i>very</i> weak, much weaker than finding a black raven. It offers the same weak (and in this case misleading) evidence that all ravens are pink.",1200262670
97980,story,,,2,2,louisadekoya,"Redeeming Gifts vs. Redeeming Gift Certificates",,"Does anyone know of an online store (preferably with an affiliate program) that allows people to redeem actual gifts rather than gift certificates/vouchers?<p>Basically, I am looking for something that would allow a shopper to buy something for someone else and provide the recipient's email address. The recipient would then get a redemption code and an email with a link to the product-order page. The recipient enters the code to redeem the gift and provides his/her shipping address. Only then is the order completed.<p>The point of this is that the sender need not know the recipient's shipping address in order to send them a gift - but the recipient can still control what orders get shipped to them.<p>In case you were wondering, a) no - Amazon does not appear to support this feature; and b) I need this for an application that I am developing.<p>Many thanks.",1200262399

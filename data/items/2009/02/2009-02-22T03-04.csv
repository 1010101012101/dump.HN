I've certainly heard such good things about (properly used) Smalltalk, but while many people compare Ruby to Smalltalk (and Ruby is the language I've used most, lately) I haven't really experienced these Smalltalk systems themselves, so I tend to refrain from saying too much bout Smalltalk (lest I make an ass of myself).",1235274146

490329,comment,490292,490292,0,0,alecst,,,"Stating cooking ""underpins all other [human evolutionary changes]"" sounds interesting if <i>corroborated</i>. I perused the web for some more information on Richard Wrangham's research. Wikipedia provided this:<p><a href=""http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=cooking-up-bigger-brains"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=cooking-up-bigger-brains</a><p><a href=""http://artsci.wustl.edu/~hpontzer/Courses/Wrangham&Conklin-Britain2003CBP%20Cooking%20as%20a%20Biological%20Trait.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://artsci.wustl.edu/~hpontzer/Courses/Wrangham&Conkl...</a><p>...and the evidence points against him. Fire doesn't appear to have been controlled until far after Wangham assests. Not only, but:<p><i>The mainstream view among anthropologists is that the increase in human brain-size was due to a shift away from the consumption of nuts and berries to the consumption of meat.</i><p>makes more sense. The transition from primitive food sources (nuts, berries -- chimp food now) may have catalyzed the transition to a regular high-calorie diet.

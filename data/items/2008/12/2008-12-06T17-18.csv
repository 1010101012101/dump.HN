Fact is that most large projects are not made of up entirely A+ developers (nor should they have to be).",1228586362

I thought that adoption and twin studies were pretty clear on the matter.<p><i>A few more articles and they'll be explaining why euthanasia for poor and stupid is a good thing.</i><p>There is actually a pretty huge gap between, e.g. ""People inherit traits from their parents, including intelligence,"" and ""All people with trait x must be killed."" Maybe if you didn't immediately make that logical leap to a policy conclusion, you'd be more comfortable considering the facts.",1228585796
388226,comment,388221,388221,0,0,bemmu,,,"Twittypic finds recently popular images people are mentioning on Twitter.<p>I'm a regular user of a site called irc-urls.net (sporadically NSFW), which finds images mentioned on IRC. I tried to think of some other sources of images, and Twitter came to mind. I created some scripts to automatically scan Twitter for images, and if an image is mentioned often enough, it gets added to the site. There is also an unrestricted raw feed.<p>I'm handling images based on a fingerprint taken from the pixel data itself, so an image with a different filename or even a sligthly different file are still regarded as the same image. Another fun feature from admin point of view is that it can guess a title for images based on the longest common substring of tweets about that image.<p>The site won't cure cancer, but hopefully provides another good source of fresh stuff to add to peoples' RSS feeds.",1228585437

do have their cognitive skills affected, usually for the worse.",1228584941
388218,comment,387950,388181,0,0,esessoms,,,"Oh, I don't for a second dispute that JavaScript is a much more elegant language than Java, and I would also put it on par with Python.  Remember, jQuery is always my first choice.<p>I only assert that once your (well, my) code base grows beyond a certain size---for me, a few thousand lines, but probably an individual threshold---JS can start to become unwieldy.  That ""unwieldy-ness"" is a problem that Java/GWT does solve.  In these cases I prefer Java precisely because it is more constraining.",1228584873

Let us judge them too.<p>How many other developers are on this team with you and your boss? Maybe you can get them to stand up and say something too.<p>Maybe you can get together with your team and do peer reviews once a week. Try reaching out to your boss about a function/module you have written that you know needs improvement and seek his opinions on what could be done. You have to start thinking of him as a peer who is trying to help create a successful business and not as an antagonist to beautiful code.<p>Your code might be pretty, but if beautifying code takes the place of bug fixing and adding features needed to sell a product or service, it doesn't matter.",1228584567

388210,comment,387921,388199,0,0,whacked_new,,,"My fault for not confirming the veracity of that story in particular, but I was using it as an illustration of accessibility to concepts in different language, independent of its truth. I just supposed that this story is widely known, but I could have (perhaps should have) easily used another example. There are several words in Chinese that describe taste without direct English translations that I know of (it is harder to sustain these ideas nowadays, given the quickness of word-borrowing like ""umami""). One of them is ""fish stink,"" which really isn't fish stink. A strong S-W will say the concept is inaccessible to the non-Chinese speaker, and, of course, that isn't true.<p>In fact you don't even need to cross language boundaries to see the same effect: layman versus technical terminology reveals analogous differences in ""perception."" Me not knowing the name of industry colors does not mean I cannot perceive these colors (let's assume a single-sex population), but I will gladly group together large groups of colors into single words.",1228584279

388208,comment,388155,388155,0,0,SingAlong,,,"I've dealt with such a guy during a freelance project. Heck my situation was worse. The boss and his whole team of 6 members were like an expired drug who couldn't even read the docs of a framework or language and would get excited and choose a framework in an (unstable) ver 0.1 for production env. Everytime I had to tell/explain the right way of doing things I had to explain to boss+6 guys. So I hit upon two options.<p>Let him run/test the web app or QUIT<p>Option-1: LET HIM RUN/test the webapp. When errors pop he'll surely come to you. Then explain the right way to him and don't tell him anything more than what he needs to know about the error. This is peaceful and will make your boss more happy that he has a guy who's capable of doing stuff. Days later you'll be called the hero who could do things the right way (yeah like Hancock coming thru the door and not breaking a wall to get in). I chose this. So now whenever there's anything wrong they call me for help even to this day long after the project is over.<p>Option-2: QUIT. There's no way you can work with these guys if you can't convince them.<p>I would suggest choosing the first option. Means a lot professionally.",1228584210

388202,comment,387623,387623,0,0,theantidote,,,"Definitely charge people extra for making intranet sites IE 6 compatible because they have control over that and they should upgrade. Otherwise you can consider a small surcharge for IE6 on internet sites but it's kind of unfair to punish your clients for the browsers their customers use because they can't really do much about it. On your own site more ads are okay along with copious upgrade links and links to Firefox/Opera.<p>Funny story: I've been working on a project for the past 2 weeks and I basically finished it in Safari and I was getting ready to do a long day or two of debugging for IE6 when I opened it up in IE6 and lo and behold it was (nearly) perfect!

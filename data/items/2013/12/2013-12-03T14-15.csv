6840602,comment,6839702,6839702,5,0,Pxtl,,,"That was really freaking long.<p>I can&#x27;t help but notice the recurring theme that the actual game designers are trying to make fun gender-neutral products but the marketing and leadership is the source of misogyny.  I mean, when they start talking about the PS1 era their examples are WipeOut (the only &quot;gendered&quot; thing in the game is the announcer) Tomb Raider (Croft has somewhat absurd proportions but she&#x27;s a far cry from the kind of exploitative stuff you see in the Dead or Alive games and whatnot) and Gran Turismo (masculine only by the technicality that it&#x27;s about cars).<p>I&#x27;m a guy, so this is obviously a &quot;check my privilege&quot; thing, but I feel like the misogyny of the gaming industry (and geek culture at large) didn&#x27;t really take hold until console gaming went online and the collective sea of poop-throwing 4channers got their he-man-woman-haters club into games.  The games were <i>targeted</i> at boys well before then, and the themes got heavily masculine in the mid-&#x27;90s with the FPS revolution... but the active You Are Not Welcome thing seemed to take hold later.<p>I mean, obviously geek culture was a bit unsettling for women before then because the combined awkward sexual frustration of a zillion nerds isn&#x27;t exactly <i>comfortable</i> to be around, but I don&#x27;t think the outright <i>hatred</i> of women had taken hold.<p>It seems like the door was open... not so much, anymore.",1386082743

6840591,comment,6838836,6838836,5,0,fat0wl,,,"if you are watching, modersky, please appreciate that a big reason these articles get upvoted is because people want to discuss Scala. many of the comments are positive :D<p>i for one see value in Scala, for many of the reasons outlined here, though I am experimenting and thinking it through for myself. the more interaction i have with it the more i see it as a marriage of several great worlds. One could argue that this makes for a jack-of-all-trades scenario. but let&#x27;s be honest, that is what the web world seems to be demanding.<p>& now, to fan the flames the tiniest bit -- when I was in the RoR ecosystem it made me absolutely <i>sick</i> how fervently the user-base seemed to glorify and idolize it. Go to any random blog post on the internet that paints Rails negatively and you will see a stream of tl;dr comments defending it that have almost NO technical basis. just my experience anyway... and in many cases all they seemed to be defending was syntactic sugar, a tangled web of OO, and mediocre gems. But my real disappointment was that the culture of convention seemed to be a cultural of programming ignorance and non-education.<p>This does not mean I hate RoR, since these discussions are irrelevant. But the point is that I appreciate that Martin&#x27;s views are at least rooted in programming philosophy rather than hype-mongering for or against. Scala is a student&#x27;s language at the very least, whereas many other popular web languages are an uninspired grouping of OO conventions. He seems to want to educate, moreso than proselytize. Perhaps this simply makes him the devil&#x27;s advocate but I see the potential for Scala to be much more than an exercise. And if some other JVM language gets a better foothold, I doubt Mr. Odersky will mentally implode. I expect more Scala ecosystem advancements far into the future.",1386082642

6840522,comment,6838836,6838836,44,0,pron,,,"As someone who &quot;bashed&quot; Scala numerous times in HN comments, let me explain why, but first, a bit about my background: Nowadays I program mostly in Java and some Clojure; before that, I developed in C and C++ for many years. I like both the OO and the FP approaches, and I am all in favor of incorporating FP concepts into OO languages (Java 8 lambdas) and vice versa (Clojure protocols).<p>I think that as a research language Scala is very important. It meshes features found in many different languages (OO types, algebraic types, duck-typing, macros) into one compiler, and so teaches us a lot about how these features can interoperate.<p>But Scala wishes to be a practical language as well. As such, I think it is an exceptionally badly-designed language (which does not, in itself, merits bashing) that masquerades, or claims to be, a well designed one, and herein lies the problem.<p>As Rich Hickey so eloquently puts it in one of his talks[1], a programming language is like a musical instrument. Every instrument has properties that introduce constraints. A trumpet can only play one note at a time, while a piano has very limited sustain. These constraints do not limit the artistic expression of the instrument – they assist it. An instrument with no constraints is a &quot;choose-a-phone&quot;, and as Rich Hickey says, no one wants to play a choose-a-phone. That is not to say that a rich piece of music cannot be composed for a piano-and-trumpet ensemble. In fact, the JVM, which Scala targets, is the perfect language-ensemble tool, as it offers a harmonic interoperation of different languages of different kinds.<p>Scala is the ultimate choose-a-phone language, with little or no constraints. When it removed the constraints by mixing all these disparate features, it lost most of their underlying justifications. It adopted JavaScript&#x27;s duck-types but lost the simplicity of the language; it adopted Haskell&#x27;s algebraic types, but lost the control over side-effects; it adopted Java&#x27;s OO types, but again, lost their static-type simplicity. But JavaScript uses duck typing <i>because</i> it can keep the language itself dead-simple and easy; Haskell uses those sometimes-hard-to-grasp algebraic types <i>because</i> they offer safety and carefully controlled side-effects; Java has a basic OO type system <i>because</i> it offers some safety while keeping the language relatively simple. Scala takes these features but drops their reasoning; in the process it lost its coherence. So the challenge of programming Scala turns from the challenge of simply expressing your artistic ideas with your chosen instrument into keeping yourself in line without those helpful constraints. It makes playing a harmonious melody difficult.<p>Scala masquerades as a well-designed language because it includes all of these modern, cool, features. Each of these features is well designed. But putting all of them together is the opposite of good design. The whole, in this case, is much less than the sum of its parts.<p>All this is not purely philosophical. Languages like Clojure and Erlang tell the programmer &quot;this is how you should write software&quot;, and if you need to do something else, you should integrate Java or C code. Scala, on the other hand, offers little guidance. Immutable and mutable variables are just as easy to declare; the &quot;expression problem&quot; is sometimes solved using OO and sometimes FP. As a research language - that&#x27;s great; as a practical language, it can be destructive.<p>It is also wasted effort. While it is certainly true that sometimes &quot;named types&quot; are better while other times duck-typing is more convenient, or that sometimes you want simple mutability and sometimes you don&#x27;t, or that sometimes pattern matching is better than polymorphism and sometimes the other way around, in 99% of the cases, either of these approaches works well. Good, working, efficient, complex software has been written in Java, Haskell, JavaScript and Lisp. Combining all those features into one language creates big, largely unnecessary, overlaps in functionality that mostly cause confusion. This wasted effort is not just a waste; it is downright harmful, because Scala has become a very complex language. So complex, in fact, that no one but veteran Scala experts can understand how Scala&#x27;s linked-list is implemented.<p>It is also unnecessary because, as I&#x27;ve said, the JVM is a multi-paradigm environment. If one paradigm is better than another for different parts of your software, you can write parts of it in Java, others in Clojure, others still in Erjang, and others in Frege. Even then you&#x27;ll find that one, simple, language is perfect for 98% of your project, while another simple language is the best fit for the remaining 2%.<p>I think Scala&#x27;s designers are stuck in their PL-research point of view. It is immediately apparent that Scala is not a language that grew from developers&#x27; needs and problems (like Clojure and Erlang), but from a PL experiment. Some years ago it might have been OK to overlook much of Scala&#x27;s complexity and use it as &quot;a better Java&quot;. Now, Scala has become ever more complex, and at the same time, better designed practical languages for the JVM have shown up. Given the wide choice, I think Scala is now a particularly bad option for a practical JVM language, especially if you&#x27;re working in a large team, as every complicating language feature causes compounded damage as the number of developers on your team grows.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Perfor...</a>",1386082015

6840464,comment,6839702,6839911,7,0,rayiner,,,"First, &quot;feminism&quot; is too broad of a concept to apply in this context. The subset of &quot;feminism&quot; you&#x27;re probably talking about, a counter-culture push back against gendered socialization, never got much traction to begin with and is certainly not more prevalent today than it was say in the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s. The mainstream of modern feminism embraces gendered socialization, and indeed there is a major contingent of modern &quot;feminists&quot; that are quite reactionary (extolling the virtues of stay at home motherhood). Moreover, birthing and medical trends have also gone backwards. For example, formula feeding, which unshackles mothers and allows fathers to assume the primary role in feeding infants, has been on the decline since the 1970&#x27;s. In 1972, only 22% of women breastfed in the U.S., by 1995 it was back over 60%. We&#x27;re still limping towards gender equality, but &quot;feminism&quot; as it used to exist is quite dead.<p>Second, it&#x27;s ridiculous to think that &quot;half a century of counter-culture&quot; would do anything to impact a sociological phenomenon that has roots in human society dating back hundreds if not thousands of years. Girls are given dolls to play with because the historical role of women has been primary caregivers to children. That was true a thousand years ago, and it&#x27;s less true but still very true today. In the 2000&#x27;s, almost 25% of families with children under 15 had stay at home moms, and out of the families where both spouses worked, the mother was the primary caregiver in 70%+ of cases. This sociological fact is reflected in the market. Household products are still marketed to women, and unsurprisingly, so are dolls marketed to girls.",1386081439

They certainly are only one amongst many choices in the present day too. Do USA-ians only have diamond engagement rings?<p>The cited Priceonomics article contains a logical flaw. It says demand was created in the De Beers campaign but then goes on to describe how great demand was purposefully under-supplied by Rhodes in order to prop up the price. Similarly it says roughly &#x27;you like diamonds because a marketer told you to&#x27; but also then says that diamonds prior to establishing large mines were the preserve of Kings and Queens ... why then did they like them; they are just people too. The answer of course is that they&#x27;re durable and look pretty and aren&#x27;t [or weren&#x27;t] commonly available. It&#x27;s a great article, but they like you I fear have just pushed it that tiny little bit further seems supported.<p>Some other citations from a couple of minutes searching:<p>- this patent suggests that large settings on narrow bands were the fashion in 1927, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/patents?id=LtZEAAAAEBAJ&zoom=4&dq=%22engagement%20ring%22&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22engagement%20ring%22&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.co.uk/patents?id=LtZEAAAAEBAJ&zoom=4&dq=%2...</a><p>- Beck vs Cohen, 16 March 1933 concerns the specifics of engagement rings being part of an obligation to marry; suggesting they were a customary part of betrothals at that time.<p>- from 1868, <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tL1YAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22engagement+ring%22+history&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tL1YAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22engage...</a>, suggests at pp18-19 that when betrothal fell out of fashion in the middle ages engagement rings were retained.<p>TL;DR - the suggestion in your post is that engagement rings were very uncommon [my word, AlexandrB&#x27;s was &quot;occassional&quot;] in USA prior to a De Beers campaign. This seems to be an exaggeration. Perhaps De Beers instead achieved the end of making diamonds the fashionable stone to choose for the already customary engagement ring.",1386081339

6840385,comment,6839702,6840029,26,0,mseebach,,,"Diamonds have a slightly more complex role than just being conjured from thin air by marketing.<p><i>Premarital sex is not, popular opinion to the contrary, a new discovery. In most societies we know of, however, men prefer to marry women who have never slept with anyone else. This creates a problem. Unmarried women are reluctant to have sex for fear that it will lower their ability to find a suitable husband, and as a result unmarried men have difficulty finding women to sleep with.<p>One traditional solution to this problem is for unmarried couples to sleep together on the understanding that if the woman gets pregnant the man will marry her. This practice was sufficiently common in a number of societies for which we have data that between a quarter and half of all brides went to the altar pregnant.<p>One problem with this practice is that it creates an opportunity for opportunistic breach by the man, the strategy of seduce and abandon familiar in folk songs, romantic literature, and real life. That problem can be reduced by converting the understanding into an enforceable contract. Under traditional common law, a jilted bride could sue for breach of promise to marry. The damages she could collect reflected the reduction in her future marital prospects. They were in fact, although not in form, damages for loss of virginity.<p>Starting in the 1930&#x27;s, U.S. courts became increasingly reluctant to recognize the action for breach of promise to marry, with the result that between 1935 and 1945 it was abolished in states containing about half the population. This created a problem for women who wanted to engage in premarital sex but did not want to end up as single mothers in a society where that status was both economically difficult and heavily stigmatized.<p>The solution they found was described in &quot;Rings and Promises,&quot; an ingenious article by Margaret Brinig. The practice of a man giving his intended a valuable diamond engagement ring is not, De Beers&#x27; ads to the contrary, an ancient custom. Data for diamond imports in the early part of the century are not very good, but Brinig&#x27;s conclusion from such information as she was able to find was that the practice only became common in the 1930&#x27;s, peaked in the 1950&#x27;s and has since declined.<p>Her explanation was that the engagement ring served as a performance bond for the promise to marry. Instead of suing, the jilted bride could simply keep the ring, confiscating the posted bond. The practice eventually declined not because of further legal changes—at present no states recognize the action for breach of promise to marry—but as a result of social changes. As pre-marital sex became more common and virginity of less importance on the marriage market, the risk of opportunistic breach, and thus the need for a bonding mechanism, declined.</i><p><a href=\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Laws_Order_draft/laws_order_ch_13.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Laws_Order_draft/laws_order_ch...</a><p>So there was an opening market for something that could be construed as both romantic and serve a strictly financial purpose. Diamonds could fit that bill, and DeBeers deftly latched onto it and milked it hard.<p>I think marketing has power to shape and inform already existing needs and desires, but it has extremely limited power to create need where none exists. That is, you can plausibly make me want a BigMac over a Whopper, but you can&#x27;t make be want a burger if I&#x27;m already full.",1386080688

It&#x27;s like their choices were wrong--they should have gone with X instead. This isn&#x27;t usually how the articles about X are actually meant to be read, but it&#x27;s how some people see them nonetheless.<p>Now, these people are feeling slighted (however unfairly). They&#x27;re not going to drop everything and pick up X. Fair enough: jumping to every shiny new technology would be madness. But chances are they won&#x27;t even bother learning about X properly. Instead, they want some plausible sounding reason about why X is not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, about why they&#x27;re actually smarter for not using it than vice versa, about why it&#x27;s all just more hype. They want to stick it to those smug X-using bastards.<p>So they vote up critical articles that just happen to be written coherently, regardless of how accurate they may actually be. And so we get dross on the front page. Happily, the HN comments tend to paint a much better picture: they simultaneously debunk the original argument while exploring the actual upsides and downsides to X. With these sort of articles, the contents are worth far more than the actual blog posts.<p>X here is anything from Scala to NoSQL to functional programming.

You can not say &quot;formal methods are a way not to think&quot;, because the theoretical existence of a sequence of transformations giving you the final program does not tell you how to find those transformations, so some thinking on the part of programmer is still needed. Of course you can come up with a program by a way of thinking completely uninformed by the formal specification, and then formalize it, but this is not what Dijkstra is speaking of in this article. What I am saying in the comment is that I do not believe many people benefit that much from a formal approach to program development, just like not that many new theorems in mathematics, outside of mathematical logic, were discovered using the tools of mathematical logic.

Their concern was well-founded: subsequent history has shown not only that <i>NSA actively intervened with IBM and NBS to shorten the key size</i>, but also that the short key size enabled exactly the kind of massively parallel key crackers that Hellman and Diffie sketched out. When these were ultimately built outside the classified world, they made it clear that DES was insecure and obsolete. In 2012, a $10,000 commercially available machine can recover a DES key in days.",1386079850

Perhaps the most high-profile of them is the continuum hypothesis.<p>Maybe P!=NP is such a conjecture.  Maybe the existence of a solution to the Navier-Stokes equation is such a problem.  For Poincaré, the very idea that there is math that can be neither proved nor disproved was not in his mental vocabulary.<p>On another note, Weil&#x27;s celebrated proof of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem relies  on the existence of inaccessible cardinals[1], although I&#x27;ve heard it conjectured that they are not necessary.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_cardinal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_cardinal</a>",1386079300

It asserts that you can pick a countable(denumerable using the terminology in the post) sequence from any infinite set.  The axiom of choice asserts (informally) that given any collection of sets, you can form another set which consists of one element from each set in the collection.  The axiom of choice asserts that this holds true even when the number of sets is uncountable (non-denumerable).<p>The axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are equivalent, meaning the assumption of either one implies the other. <<EDIT: This is wrong, see below>>",1386079289

I'm not saying you're wrong but you're certainly too sure of yourself.<p>Economic Models, by definition, have to make assumptions on psychology.  Those assumptions can often be wrong and that invalidates the model.<p>To put this in real terms lets look at the construction worker.  Say the government, as the spender of last resort, starts a bunch of construction projects.  The economic theory here is the construction worker will get a job which will put money in his pocket.  He will then go out and spend that money which will cause the places where he spends his money to hire more people.  That starts a virtuous cycle that gets the economy out of trouble.<p>The problem with that is, in my experience, the construction worker doesn't think that way.  He's been unemployed for a year or more already so instead of spending he takes every spare cent and saves it for a rainy day.  Because the construction job is finite.  Since he was already getting government subsidized aide as an unemployed person the money he spends on food and other essentials is negligible.  So if he saves his extra money then the government spending has no impact on the economy (until he's forced to use that money by a crisis)<p>Again there are valid arguments on both sides but your certainty that your side is right seems naive (and that's being polite to you)",1315774487

So, yes, I've gotten used to automating certain operations via shell scripts that wrap p4.<p>> ... or just checkout your entire clientspec and ask your P4 client to revert unchanged files...<p>If you do that, though, the server will tell everyone else that checks out any file that you have it opened for edit too.

I own my own servers and lease a full rack and I serve roughly 1 billion page impressions per month. My bandwidth consumption is measured in Mbps rather than amount of data transferred because I get billed using 95th percentile billing. I average around 130 megabits per second of transfer - constantly, peaking at 150mbps I'm transferring roughly 40 terabytes of data per month. 95th percentile billing and owning your own servers is they key here.<p>To give you an idea, for one month of your hosting bill you can buy 1, possibly 2 servers from Dell and put them in a half rack that will cost you around $800/month including power, secure access, bandwidth, etc. Those servers will last around 5 years with a possible drive replacement or two during that time for a few bucks.<p>But I think you have another problem that's making things worse. With 15,000 active users you should be able to support them on one or two small Linode servers using round robin DNS. That's a relatively small user base and the number of requests per second can't be anything more than 10 per second? So I'm guessing something about your basic app architecture is off. It could be that you're not using Nginx to reverse proxy to Apache and you think you need more apache children/processes, and therefore more memory, than you actually do. You could have a DB that doesn't have indexes in the right places and so you're IO bound.<p>I would suggest first looking at your app and seeing where the bottlenecks are in performance. Fix that first, then look at hosting.<p>Questions:<p>-How many servers do you currently have and give us a rough idea of config.<p>-How many app requests per second do you get at peak?<p>-What's your peak bandwidth throughput in Mbps?<p>-On your servers, is lack of CPU or lack of disk throughput the bottleneck?<p>-Have you had problems running out of memory that caused you to buy more servers? Which app ran out of memory?<p>-Give us an idea of your server config. e.g. nginx -> Apache -> MySQL & Redis. Do the servers talk to each other and if so what do they do?",1315773407

Anyway, that is true of all implementations of red-black trees I have seen, and intentionally so. When you consider the number of possible parent/child configurations when splitting and merging 2-3-4 nodes, there's a whole lot of them. By expanding a 2-3-4 node as a cluster of red-black nodes, the local combinatorics are more manageable.<p>Even the presentations of red-black trees in textbooks (e.g. CLRS) usually obscure the connection with 2-3-4 trees, with one exception being Sedgewick's own book. That's too bad.<p>> 4) If you're doing rbtrees in Haskell, you might as well enforce your invariants with the type system.<p>If you're going to do that, it's probably easier to use the isomorphism with 2-3-4 trees and work with that. There's a standard trick for representing trees with the 2-3-4 invariant using non-regular data types:<p><pre><code>    data Tree a = Zero a | Succ (Tree (Node a))\n    data Node a = Node2 a a | Node3 a a a | Node4 a a a a\n</code></pre>\nAlternatively, you could use left-leaning red-black trees, which have an isomorphism with 2-3 trees.<p>But it's not clear to me that there's much of a practical win in encoding the balance invariant in the type system here.",1315772975

A few things to consider...<p>Borrowing - When people discuss the Debt (National and Private) they focus on the wrong thing which is ""How are we going to pay this back?"".  That's an issue but the bigger issue is why we needed it.  Borrowing is a wealth transfer from the future to the present.  You're saying ""I'm going to take this money from my future and use it now"".  So our economic growth in the last decade has been built on taking money from the future and combining it with our present output.  So the real debt problem is we need to borrow to maintain the standard of living we've grown accustomed to and we can't borrow forever.<p>Unrealistic Expectations - One of the results of the above borrowing is we've seen spectacular growth in the stock market.  From 1971 to 1986 the Dow increased from 874 to 1912.  From 1986 to 2001 the Dow increased from 1912 to 9811  (and that was off a high of over 10,000).  Housing prices from 1896 to 1996 remained relatively the same (<a href=""http://nyti.ms/TxoI4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nyti.ms/TxoI4</a>) but then increased 100% between 1996 and 2006.  So the asset value increases a whole generation has come to expect aren't normal and were driven by borrowing (look at the national debt increase for these same periods).  In other words it isn't realistic to, for example, think a 401k will fully finance your retirement because stock values shouldn't grow that significantly.<p>Crash Fallout - This is a simple one.  As valuations fall so do people's perceived savings.  People who thought they had a $300,000 house and $1 million in their 401(k) find they now have a $100,000 house and $200k in their 401(k).  So they stop spending on luxuries for a long, long time to restore their savings.<p>Demographic Shift - If you ever get the chance there's a very short audio book by a guy named Harry Dent called ""The Great Debt Crisis"" that's worth reading (Its $23 on Audible).  He studies spending patterns of people by age.  The argument he makes is we're at the end of a spending boom.  People spend money from their early 20s until their kids graduate from college.  Then they start to save.  We're at the point where all the children of the Baby Boomers are graduating or are about to graduate college.  At that point the Baby Boomers spending will drop dramatically.  This is a problem because the Baby Boomers had far fewer children.  So we're going to see a major fall from that.<p>These four factors (along with other more minor ones) make me think we're going to see a major drop in the next decade.",1315771762

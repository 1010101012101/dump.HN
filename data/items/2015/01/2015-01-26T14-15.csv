8947274,comment,8946923,8946923,0,0,smhenderson,,,"Most of my HTML is generated by Perl so I am the opposite. Alls string vars at the Perl level are wrapped in double quotes in case interpolation is necessary. Attributes are wrapped in single quotes so my Perl code doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of \&quot; patterns scattered throughout.<p>I totally agree about consistency though; I even take the minor performance hit when interpolation is unnecessary by using double quotes anyway so that all uses of double and single quotes are consistent",1422284348
8947273,comment,8945477,8947224,0,0,mrchicity,,,"Yes that&#x27;s how things work on itch/ouch. Downside with that is you can see your order hit the feed before you know it&#x27;s yours. For people who want to exclude their orders from their view of the market, they have to build heuristics to handle this case or risk flashing/chasing their own tail.<p>Also doesn&#x27;t help the IOC case. If market data dissemination is usually faster than the private order entry/ack/fill channel, it would be better to know that a trade resulted from my IOC by seeing it on the data feed rather than waiting.",1422284322
8947271,comment,8946939,8946939,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"I have a sneaking suspicion that certain groups of people are just much less susceptible to ads. I never click on ads. I mean, literally never. If you run an ad monetized site, I am the moocher who never makes you any money. If I search Google for something, and the result comes up as both an ad and a non-ad, I click on the non-ad link. If it only comes up as an ad, I keep searching. With me it&#x27;s almost irrational, stemming from when long commercial breaks would interrupt cartoons and movies I watched. Ironically, I am building a mobile app that&#x27;s going to be ad monetized (well, at least the free version will be). I suppose that makes me hypocrite.<p>At the same time, I think I&#x27;m not alone. There&#x27;s just something dreadful about having your decision making so directly influenced. It&#x27;s sort of a &quot;why are you trying to push this thing on me? Is it not good enough to stand on its own merit?&quot; I believe that when I need something, I will find it and do my own research. This is why I also never put much value in Facebook. Who clicks on those ads? Aren&#x27;t you just there to socialize?<p>Edit: I should say that I am aware enough to realize that there are much more subtle form of marketing that definitely do influence me. If a person I respect gives something a good review, for example, I will be more likely to buy it. If a company has a good story to tell about themselves, that makes me think highly of them. If it&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ve seen on Shark Tank I&#x27;m more likely to consider it because I&#x27;m more familiar with what they do. Ads are just too obvious about it for me.",1422284316

8947259,comment,8947080,8947207,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"A lot of martial arts are wildly impractical in 99.99% of everyday circumstances. The list includes almost all martial arts involving bladed weaponry, most martial arts involving canes or blunt instruments, and most of the classical, unarmed arts that a layperson would recognize.<p>This is one of the major reasons why &quot;practical&quot; martial arts, such as Krav Maga, have become so popular in recent years. It doesn&#x27;t mean the less practical arts are not &quot;arts,&quot; or are somehow not &quot;martial.&quot; The history of martial arts is a history of the militaries, weapons, circumstances, etc., that have given rise to the <i>need</i> for formalized combat styles throughout the world. In feudal Japan, for instance, it was probably a very helpful and practical thing to be well-versed in the art of the samurai sword. In present-day Japan, a bit less so.<p>Some martial arts are practical in 2015. Some martial arts were practical in 1915, and some were practical in 1515. Circumstances change. The stuff people wear, or carry around with them everyday, or bring into a combat zone, change pretty quickly and dramatically. And of course, some martial arts have never really been practical at all, being used mainly for ceremony, discipline, and lifestyle.",1422284179

8947216,comment,8946939,8946939,0,0,corin_,,,"> <i>Premium ads can get well over an order of magnitude higher CPM, so the picture might not be quite as bleak as I’m making it out to be. But to get premium ads you need to appeal to specific advertisers. What advertisers are interested in an audience that’s mostly programmers with an interest in low-level shenanigans?</i><p>I&#x27;ve no experience marketing anything aimed at this audience, so have no idea what suitable companies think about this, nor what CPMs or CPAs they&#x27;d be used to seeing in their ad spends.<p>But as a rule of thumb, targeted means more interesting to advertisers who want to hit that audience. For example if a VPS company wanted to advertise, where better than on a popular programmer&#x27;s blog? (Again I have no idea on what margins or target CPAs a VPS company would have, so just a random example.)<p>Of course, a targeted audience that doesn&#x27;t interest any advertisers can have the opposite effect and drive your CPMs down, but more often than not it will help. It&#x27;s just a question of will it help enough to justify the time getting the right advertisers to part with their money to advertise with you.<p>(I also have no experience either selling or buying adverts for personal blogs, but the above rule of thumb is pretty scalable.)<p>edit: Got distracted before finishing reading, and will now add my thoughts to his last paragraph:<p>> <i>There’s the argument that ad blocking is piracy and/or stealing, but I’ve never heard a convincing case made. If anything, I think that some of the people who make that argument step over the line, as when ars technica blocked people who used ad blockers, and then backed off and merely exhorted people to disable ad blocking for their site. I think most people would agree that directly exhorting people to click on ads and commit click fraud is unethical; asking people to disable ad blocking is a difference in degree, not in kind. People who use ad blockers are much less likely to click on ads, so having them disable ad blockers to generate impressions that are unlikely to convert strikes me as pretty similar to having people who aren’t interested in the product generate clicks.</i><p>I make most of my living from people seeing digital adverts and I&#x27;d never argue its piracy or stealing. So I&#x27;m with the author on that one.<p>As to preventing people from reading your website if they don&#x27;t disable adblockers - I think it&#x27;s a shitty thing to do, it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d ever be willing to suggest anyone does, but at the same time I don&#x27;t see why a website shouldn&#x27;t at least be allowed to do it. If a site does it and you don&#x27;t like it then stop visiting.<p>Personally I like sites that show &quot;You&#x27;re using an adblocker - you can keep using it if you like, but we&#x27;d really appreciate if you didn&#x27;t&quot;. The reason for this is I disagree with the premise that those who use adblock won&#x27;t click adverts. The number one reason for people using adblock is that too many advertisers/publishers allow shitty adverts. Adverts that pop out of the window. Or cover up content. Or use too much bandwidth or memory. Etc. If you&#x27;re not one of those publishers, and you don&#x27;t allow those kinds of advertisers on your site, then there&#x27;s plenty of people who use adblock but might consider clicking on one or more of your adverts if they could be persuaded to view them. I&#x27;m not talking about asking them to click adverts, just that if they see them they might actually <i>want</i> to click on them.<p>I don&#x27;t have data to back this up, but have a couple of people I&#x27;m going to talk to and hopefully see if I can get numbers to demonstrate this, as I&#x27;m confident its the case.<p>Alternatively if anyone reading this has a decent-sized audience (preferably with a high pageview to unique ratio - i.e. more loyal visitors rather than just visitors driven by search enginges) and would be interested in testing, feel free to get in touch to chuck about a couple of ideas. I couldn&#x27;t really help on the execution side, but would happy to give advice on how to test if you&#x27;d be willing to share numbers with me afterwards. (The basic idea would be to see what % of people respond to polite requests to disable adblock, and how click rates are affected. If you have the technical chops to do more then could go further and either attempt to anonymously identify which clicks came from a previous adblock user, and also look at actual conversion rates rather than just click rates if your advertisers allow you access to this data.)",1422283656

However, leaving it completely open lets people do the &quot;lean two sticks together&quot; thing. It can also be much much worse than that. I remember reading about an exhibit someone was doing where they were letting a dog starve over several weeks while on display. The dog died. Shocking? Yes. Art? No.<p>Here&#x27;s a good working definition of art I like: &quot;Art isn&#x27;t art until it&#x27;s sold.

8947196,comment,8939328,8941145,0,0,alanctgardner3,,,"> The biggest issue with big data is most of it sits unused<p>This is really variable. If you&#x27;re at a place where they jumped on the bandwagon, then yes. There are also lots of companies (and not just Google/FB/LinkedIn) that build mission critical reporting and ML infratstructure on Hadoop. These companies appreciate the value of workflow coordination, and they wouldn&#x27;t move ahead without (at least) Oozie/Azkaban in place to give some visibility into their workflow.<p>> But, in the long term, there will be a big change.<p>I think more types of work will become commoditized. If you just want log processing, there are lots of on-premises and cloud options. Splunk has been doing this forever. Ostensibly with good-enough BI software you could just focus on ingest, and everything else is drag and drop. On a long enough time frame, hand-rolling pipelines will become obsolete. This is like a 10+ year timeline for any player to get significant market share. In the meantime, people have to actually get stuff done, and their skills will be transferable because they understand distributed systems, ETL, warehousing, and a lot of other stuff that hasn&#x27;t really changed in a decade.<p>> Becoming an expert in a particular data engineering component<p>Are you advocating that nobody writes Spark Streaming jobs, because they should rewrite Spark instead? Don&#x27;t learn to work with Impala, learn to rewrite Impala? I disagree, the tools are only getting better, and it&#x27;s going to take more and more work to replace the entrenched players.  Working on top of solid tools will make you far more productive than engaging in NIH and making your own SQL engine.<p>> Becoming an expert on quickly and effectively deploying cloud services to get the job done<p>Like RedShift, EMR and Amazon Data Pipeline? They&#x27;re hardly turn-key solutions. Amazon&#x27;s Kinesis is just Kafka with paid throughput - you can absolutely re-use your skills in the cloud, without having to cave and get locked in to a single vendor serving one specific use-case.<p>> What not to become is one of these OSS DIY bigots: not good enough to build truly differentiating technology, but adamant about building and running their own <up and coming OSS technology><p>So in your mind you either pick a vendor to handle all your data for you, or you&#x27;re an &quot;OSS DIY bigot&quot;? Something like owning your entire user analytics pipeline isn&#x27;t mission critical for a startup, it&#x27;s stupid to build it yourself?<p>> These folks will be wiped out in the next decade or so.<p>Even though Oracle is amazing and great, lots of people still use Postgres, MySQL, etc. There&#x27;s always going to be a continuum from &quot;We should buy his turnkey thing&quot; to &quot;we started by rolling our own SQL query engine&quot;.

But now the exchange has to deal with spoofers. Or not. but they must be explicit about their policy with regards to spoofing and rigoursly and rapidly enforce that policy. If they are not they create a syatem where some participants will break the rules to gain advantage and others will follow them and suffer. And allowing spoofing might be a violation of dodd-frank (i am not sure if this exchange implicitly falls under its scope or not) so again, some participants might feel to play it safe while others wont have such qualms.<p>Atleast using an order based feed makes it easier to track bogus orders which increases the difficulty for spoofers vs motivated play by the rules dont commit hundreds of felonies per day liquidity providers.<p>Trading ...ugh",1422283486

For one day, the hand computers kept up: &quot;The only difference was that the IBM machines didn&#x27;t get tired and could work three shifts. But the girls got tired after a while.&quot;<p>Feynmann worked out a technique to run several calculations in parallel on the punched-card machines that reduced the time required. &quot;The problems consisted of a bunch of cards that had to go through a cycle. First add, then multiply, and so it went through the cycle of machines in this room - slowly - as it went around and around. So we figured a way to put a different colored set of cards through a cycle too, but out of phase. We&#x27;d do two or three problems at a time,&quot; explained Feynman.

But I don&#x27;t find that at all convincing.<p><i>If you are a contractor or can build a network from the blog that 1700 pa is going to get wiped out in one deal.</i><p>No... it&#x27;ll still be there. And it&#x27;ll be there if you have a bad month -- or year -- and you end up depending more than you&#x27;d want on that otherwise paltry sum.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is without merit. I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s incredibly short-sighted. I like to look at the big picture as well, but to suggest that money you might bring in with minimal impact is necessarily useless in the face of the potential to bring in more money in other (largely or totally unrelated) ways strikes me as seriously out of touch with the lows reality can drop on your doorstep.<p><i>Stick a mailchimp form on your blog and keep writing interesting stuff.</i><p>This is at least much more reasonable than making blanket statements that start with &quot;No.&quot;",1422283037

You have the job at the salary you want. If not, then consider their counter-offer and decide if that&#x27;s something you want to accept.<p>The hiring managers for most jobs are not business owners. They are middle managers with multiple bosses. Most see the hiring process as an opportunity to show they are management material. If you give them a number that they know you will accept, they can pull whatever levels need to be pulled in the organization to get approval. What they don&#x27;t want to happen is that they overbid for a candidate who then still rejects the offer. That makes them look incompetent in front of HR and upper management.

There are two important factors usually being ignored in these discussions:<p>- Human labour is not only about producing <i>stuff</i> or advancing sciences, that&#x27;s a narrow-minded, or even consumerist view of life. We are also creative, we like to appreciate beauty and like to be appreciated for things we create. Even when every thinkable and unthinkable <i>thing</i> will be produced by the machines, we will be able to focus on arts. We will be creating unique things, re-distribute it among ourselves and inevitably some of us will prove to be better at that than the others. Appreciation on one hand and the show-off factor on the other are in our nature, I don&#x27;t think they will ever become an atavism.<p>- Scarcity of natural resources: something suggests our fight for (possession of) resources will continue until at least we have a technology that transforms any matter to anything, which has nothing or very little to do with the AI per se. But then there will be a problem of habitable space. We will fight for possessing more than the others, that&#x27;s also part of our nature. More habitable planets, more powerful machines, more possibilities. Because those who possess less have smaller chances to survive.<p>So no, inequality and survivalism (in a broader sense) are not going away. And to satisfy our need to be better and to have more we&#x27;ll have to maintain a socio-economic system that ensures inequality is always in place. It&#x27;s going to be Capitalism 2.0 rather than Communism.",1422281882

A developer that works strange hours<p>2.  A need to get everybody in the same room<p>3.  The &quot;perception problem&quot;, a.k.a. snide remarks from the peanut gallery.<p>The first thing to do is to be a good technical manager and admit that you do, in fact, have inconsistent requirements.  Something on this list <i>must</i> change.  You cannot satisfy all three.<p>The next thing to look at is what is the best (or least-bad) requirement to change.<p>The simplest option is to fire the developer.  I don&#x27;t actually recommend that, but it is simple.  Embedded in that statement is the implicit assumption that you will never again hire someone who works odd hours, and in my admittedly biased experience, people who work odd hours tend to be good, so there is a hidden cost to that scenario.<p>A more complicated option is to figure out how to eliminate or reduce your dependence on in-person meetings.  For example, having discussions via email or on GitHub.  I would probably argue that if your software developers are having meetings more than 0.5 times per day, they are not being productive to start with, so there are reasons independent of this particular developer to study that problem.  For more on this strategy, I would recommend looking at the GitHub model. [1]<p>Finally, to address the third issue, you need a performance review mechanism that isn&#x27;t attendance-based.  For example, consider mechanisms that are feature-based or deliverable-based.  Attendance-based performance is bad for a lot of reasons independent of any particular developer&#x27;s situation--it motivates working hard instead of working smart, and so on.<p>The thing to see here is that you&#x27;re either going to have to change the environment or the developers you place in it.  Personally, I would recommend the former, but in any case, something&#x27;s going to move.  The advantage of changing something now is that you get to decide what to change.  If you let the situation run its course, it will change in a manner and at a time that will be less convenient.<p>[1] <a href=""http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/</a>",1422281802

This allows market participants to potentially identify other market participants&#x27; orders based on their client order uuids e.g. if they are using a uuid generator that incorporates the MAC address.<p>I think I understand why they are doing this. They want to have a clean REST order entry interface, but still allow participants to know immediately when they are filled (via the websockets feed). Ultimately, they should implement a websockets order entry interface and stream accepts, fills, cancels, and rejects only to the involved participants. They should not expose any client generated ids on the public feeds, and only non-marketable orders and trades should hit the public feed. This is how it works literally everywhere else.

I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing some roles here, but the specialities I can think of are:<p>- getting data out of production systems and transforming it (infrastructure or ETL)
- analytical querying and reporting
- system administration
- machine learning<p>There&#x27;s also the wide world of NoSQL data stores, which people lump in with big data, but which require vastly different skills.<p>The Hadoop VM I linked to above is good for working through exercises for all of the above.<p>As a starting point, this book[1] walks through the motivation behind Hadoop, and then gets a little into internals and use cases. It&#x27;s out of date, but you can work through it and get into the right frame of mind, understand HDFS, etc. It&#x27;s a good starting point.<p>AMP Camp (that I linked to above) is an introduction to Spark for people with a little Hadoop experience. Spark is getting a lot of attention, you could run into it in a number of roles.<p>If you&#x27;re going to be planning the whole pipeline, or doing any sort of infrastructure role, I recommend Hadoop Application Architecture[2] for more modern tools and design patterns. This blog post[3] is a pretty good overview of distributed logs, which are essential for horizontal scale. Understanding Kafka and ZooKeeper is really useful for infrastructure roles, maybe less so for admins.<p>If you&#x27;re planning to be in the reporting layer, having a deep understanding of SQL and data warehousing is useful. This book[4] is old hat, but I would say it&#x27;s expected knowledge for anyone planning a warehouse, and it&#x27;s interesting to understand best practices. Most places will also expect knowledge of Tableau or a similar BI tool, but that&#x27;s tougher to learn on your own since licenses are brutal. Visualization with D3 is nice to have in this space, especially if you&#x27;re coming from a web background - Scott Murray&#x27;s tutorials [5] are a good starting place.<p>It&#x27;s harder to point to resources for sysadmins - if you weren&#x27;t a sysadmin before, you need to understand a lot of other concepts before you worry about Hadoop stuff. ML is similar -  you need to understand the principles and be able to work on a single node.

We&#x27;ve written a library for interacting with DynamoDB and Amazon Kinesis that uses these to handle the pagination of those resources behind the scenes so that when you&#x27;re using the library you can just treat the resource as an ordinary collection and take as many as you like.<p>We&#x27;re using the Phoenix framework <a href=""http://www.phoenixframework.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phoenixframework.org/</a> as a backend for a web app written in Angular, and also as part of a data publication service. Phoenix makes a couple of great design choices influenced by its erlang heritage. Most notably it is really just one of the erlang &quot;applications&quot; you run, so it doesn&#x27;t dominate or dictate the rest of your project structure. You can easily integrate it as just the web component of an application that has behind the scenes data processing or whatever else it is you&#x27;d want to do.<p>The only gotcha we&#x27;ve run into so far is that a lot of erlang libraries expect strings for configuration text (list of chars) whereas the convention in Elixir is to use binaries.This hasn&#x27;t resulted in any real issues though, just a perplexed minute from time to time.<p>If you have any particular questions I&#x27;d be happy to try to answer them.",1422281265

They basically just &quot;fake it&quot; by sending a bunch of guided waypoints with the offset of the phone or bracelet GPS location in airdogs case and hope it looks OK because of the really wide angle lens of the GoPro. There is a <i>lot</i> of room for improvement in this area that could be made by feeding that realtime tracking data back into the flight controller as you suggest.<p>The one startup in the drone space that is really putting computer vision stuff to work on drones is <a href=""http://skyd.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skyd.io</a> - some ex google project wing folks.

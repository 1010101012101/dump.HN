To give you a clue, when someone talks about Android to me, I think about the Android Open Source Project, the OS managed by Google. It&#x27;s essentially what the Nexus devices come with.<p>The problem with the study is that they claim to compare different operating systems, while more precisely, they are comparing different user experiences on different OSs. Big difference, I&#x27;m explaining it below, and they should know better.<p>In the case of Android, most OEMs do everything they can to differentiate their devices from other Android devices, and thus they offer a fundamentally different <i>experience</i>. They even give names to these experiences, e.g. TouchWiz or Sense. So the authors were actually comparing TouchWiz to other operating systems. This is evident by the fact that some of the features they felt were lacking are actually in Android trunk, and some of the features they found problematic are not.<p>Thus, I feel like the people who did this UX study didn&#x27;t actually know what <i>exactly</i> they were studying, based on their choice of words (TouchWiz is not mentioned at all).",1380281829

It&#x27;s this wicked modus operandi for fast growth that a hefty amount of startups go by. You trick users in early in the game (browse around <a href=""http://darkpatterns.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darkpatterns.org</a> for examples), when you have attained a large group of users, you distance yourself from your past activities. Common excuses range from &quot;we were young then!&quot; to &quot;we didn&#x27;t think we were <i>actually</i> misleading users because of this $xyz technically&quot;.

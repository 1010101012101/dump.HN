Content like a tip of the day, store locations of a retail chain, cocktail recipes etc.<p>I think this always is way too much effort. I either have to create a small web application myself to manage and serve the content in JSON/XML or configure a large open source CMS to do this (which is a pain). And I have to host and maintain those systems, which costs time and money.<p>My hosted solution is cheaper, flexible and allows developers to configure many different data sets. Editors can manage the content for these data sets and you can then easily load that content into your mobile apps with JSON. You could also load the JSON into your website with JSONP or into a desktop app, but this is currently not the focus.<p>Basically a CMS for non-HTML applications. What do you think of this idea? Would you use it? Is there a market for this? Thanks so much for your feedback.<p>http://storageroomapp.com",1288357140

Why restitution? In some cases - violent crimes - any amount of money would not be enough. Punishment has no positive effect for society.<p>Discussing and admitting the crimes would help the victim and be cheaper. In our current law system the victim, who is the one we should pay most attention to, is mostly ignored.<p>For more on this controversial standpoint read up on how Tutsi & Hutu learnt to live together after the genocide.<p>or:<p>When Brute Force Fails: How to Have Less Crime and Less Punishment

The library is just beneath what I consider necessary in terms of flexibility and robustness to be usable in production. Like no error handler in Zepto Ajax - seriously? An Ajax request will never fail... on mobile!? And this could be my perception - and I could be completely wrong - but when something is marketed as 'in only 2K!' or 'in under 50 lines!' there's a discouraging resistence to adding code in order to keep those metrics.<p>On the other hand, most micro-frameworks require the user to take more responsibility for making sure things don't break - which could mean lighter code... a good thing for mobile. For example, Emile does a fine job of tweening integers or colors, but watchout for inherited values - like fontWeight 'normal'.

Convert to smallest unit and use integers or the currency data type du jour in your language, and don't act surprised when operations on 32-bit floating point don't yield the intuitively correct values.<p>If you understood the representation format, you'd understand why.",1288354174

I share the concern of BirdLife International for the welfare of rare birds. But I think, as always, it’s important to do the numbers. It’s been estimated that 30 000 birds per year are killed by wind turbines in Denmark,
where windmills generate 9% of the electricity. Horror! Ban windmills! We also learn, moreover, that traffic kills one million birds per year in Denmark. Thirty-times-greater horror! Thirty-times-greater incentive to ban cars! And in Britain, 55 million birds per year are killed by <i>cats</i>.<p>--David MacKay, ""Sustainable Energy -- without the hot air"".<p><a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c10/page_63.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c10/page_63...</a>",1288354034

They either need to drop the word ""protection"" from that, or change ""Zero"" to ""Full"". Otherwise, it is pretty easy to read it as meaning the opposite of what they mean.

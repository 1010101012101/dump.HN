2099743,comment,2096545,2099522,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"> I didn't say I was horrified by the comment, I said I was horrified to have upvoted it by mistake.<p>Sorry I wasn't specific enough.  I actually realized this error after commenting, and considered editing, but honestly, I felt that it really wasn't that important, especially since my corrected statement would still make the same exact point.<p>>  The intent of my comment was not to insult you (it really wasn't) but to get you to consider your own remarks, which I (perhaps naively) think that downvoting generally does.<p>No.  Down voting isn't for getting people to think.  It's for saying ""No, this comment doesn't add anything to the conversation.""  Disagreeing with the sentiment is not good for down voting.  A comment that you believe doesn't provide value, however, is.<p>If your goal is to get someone to think, it's better to communicate that in a comment.<p>> Do you think that calling people ""a bunch of lemmings"" makes for a better HN?<p>Yes, I do think calling lemmings lemmings is useful: that's what they are.  You might disagree, but they are merely asking the same illogical and thoughtless questions.  I feel my description was accurate and precise.  Even the ""stupid"" remark, I feel, was justified.  I actually wondered if a better word could be found, because I don't like using ""stupid,""  but it's accurate.  Gruber's questions to Google concerning Chrome's H.264 decision are stupid.  This is especially true when you consider Gruber's history of defending Apple's decisions regarding it's support of Adobe.<p>> I've insulted plenty of people here in the past, maybe even you. For that I'm sorry.  But I'm trying to be better than that, and although I don't think it's in evidence here, I'd like to believe that you are, too.<p>It's fairly easy: unless it's obviously not contributing to the discussion, assume the person is contributing.  Even if you disagree.  The language might be direct (or even harsh to some, as I admit ""stupid"" is), but for the type of people that visit HN, this is probably just our way of being as clear as possible.  Even you had to comment on the specificity of whether you were horrified by my comment or the up voting of my comment.  A point that is meaningless when you consider the point of the original comment.<p>This is, I fear, obvious to others when we place ourselves in social situations.<p>Wife:""Do you want to take the trash out for me?""
HN Husband: ""No.""
Wife:""Take out the trash, NOW.""
HN Husband: ""Yes, dear.""<p>I'd much prefer someone clearly state how they feel then use weasel words constantly.<p>Consider for a moment my comment prior to this one, where I called out your ""I meant to downvote your comment.""  Yes, it was harsh, but only because yours was equally (in my mine) harsh.  However, the net result is now a discussion of the merits of downvoting, language, and the overall improvement of HN.  Alone, both our comments could be considered the worst of the worst of HN commentary.  Off-topic and insulting.  However, the result of this commentary is, I believe, a worthwhile discussion on comments.<p>Basically, could I have used something besides ""a bunch of lemmings""?  Sure, I suppose I could have.  However, it made my point easily enough, and expressed my thoughts accurately.",1294926886

They attribute Google's actions to abstract ideas of openness or competition between codecs.<p>But there is a concrete issue involved: under MPEG-LA's licensing terms, Google should be paying $6.5 million a year to distribute a H.264 decoder.  Under that license, the end users only get the rights to use the software ""for personal and consumer purposes"": they couldn't fork Chrome, redistribute it, etc.  The Ars article mentions this, but immediately moves on.<p>It's possible Google expects MPEG-LA to try to enforce the patents, and that's why they're dropping H.264 support.  After all, Google is the only browser vendor not in MPEG-LA worth trying to get money from.  The yearly licensing amount just went up by $1.5 million, which might have influenced the timing of the announcement.<p>Comparisons with Flash are irrelevant: it may be less open than H.264, but not in the way that matters to Google.",1294925698

time while knocking around in disreputable joints, usually late at  
night, every several months or so.  She looked so hot, so sleek, so  
sexy, so expressive, so exotic.  You'd end up back at her place and  
the night would just...  take off.  A complete blur of hot, sweaty,  
feverish, delirious, fumbling passion.  You'd do things to each  
other...  you'd do things to her, she'd do things to you...  things  
that you're not even sure have names, that you're pretty sure are  
illegal almost anywhere.  Even her kinks have kinks --- and after one  
of these nights, you'd realize that you yourself had a lot more kinks  
than you.  And it wasn't just physical, it was --- cerebral.   
Ethereal.  Transcendent.  But it would all whiz by in a blur, and by  
morning you'd find yourself lightheaded, a bit confused, and  
stumbling homeward to your regular gal.<p>Over the next few days and weeks you'd find yourself occasionally  
drifting away, thinking about her.  Haskell.  You'd be there, banging  
away at your regular girl, and find yourself thinking ""you know, if I  
was with Haskell, I'd be doing this completely differently.""  You'd  
think ""I could be doing so much bigger and better stuff with  
Haskell.""  Now, your regular girl, she's not as exotic as Haskell.   
Pretty, maybe, if you're lucky.  (Perhaps your regular girlfriend's  
name is Python. ;-)  But not nearly as --- weird.  Wild.  Cool.   
Exciting.  Don't get me wrong --- your girl, she's wonderful.  You've  
got a wonderful relationship.  She's --- comfortable.  You can bang  
away at her all day and night.  She's accommodating.  Easy going.   
You work well together.  But --- confidentially --- she's, well,  
maybe just a little bit boring.  You'd catch yourself thinking these  
things, and the guilty pangs would get to you...  You'd quash the  
thoughts, buckle down, and get back to banging away.  Comfortable...   
there's a lot to be said for that, ya know?  Comfortable...  just  
keep telling yourself that.<p>Months would go by.  Late some night you'd find yourself out,  
disreputable places again.  Maybe that hacker bar, LtU.  Somebody'd  
slip you an URL for some renegade paper, you know, one of <i>those</i>  
papers.  You'd run into Haskell again.  And the whole thing starts over.<p>Eventually, you're going to get the ultimatum.  Haskell's ultimately  
just like any other girl on some level;  she needs commitment.   
Eventually, after one night of wild, feverish, kinky, abstract  
passion, she's going to say to you:  ""All these times, and you don't  
understand me at all!  You know, you're going to have to get serious,  
mister!  I've got needs, too.  You're going to have to get serious  
about my monads, or that's the last time you're going to play with  
them!  Got it?""<p>...and then, you've got to make The Choice.<p>Chances are, you're going to go back to your regular gal.  Haskell's  
just too much for any one man, probably.  She leaves a trail of  
broken, brainy, embittered PhDs and former programmers behind her.   
She ruins you for the RealWorld.  You can ride a while, but you  
probably can't go the distance with her.  Go back to your regular gal  
and try not to think too much about what you've seen.  Done.  Felt.   
Thought.<p>Maybe you can salvage a little happiness;  but it'll be hard.  After  
all...  you've tasted Haskell.<p>She's not like anything else.<p>jb""",1294925106

Then on the next article(s) (in the near future) based on the words in the already classified article's words (which can be links to specific domains too (e.g. subscribed to some link aggregator, but it sometimes sends spams)) the unread article should be classified as probably ham/spam. And I don't want to see spam below a threshold... In short: Bayesian like learning...<p>And yeah I can use something like rss2mail and a MUA with spam filter... But I'd prefer a dedicated application (which lives on the desktop but syncs with the cloud, and multiplatform).<p>Is that too much? ;-)",1294923981

It takes a bit to understand photostreams, sets, collections, and group pools, and the online organizer is a little different. But for the most part it's efficient and is broken a lot less of the time that Facebook's photos.<p>But my average friend that would go look at my Flickr photos can't figure out how to navigate or download full-resolution. (That's mostly other parents.)<p>Leaving Flickr pro does mean losing letting other people download full-resolution of my photos, but I can only think of a handful of photos where that impacts me. I can upload those other places for free.  It does mean only seeing my last 200 photos in my photostream, but apparently all my photos already added to groups will remain visible in the group pools. There's some other pro benefits like number of sets, set size, video length, etc. that I don't think will bother me at all.<p>I think they're in a tough spot of giving too much to free users and not enough benefit to Pro users. I can't argue with their price though. I've considered dropping pro before but $29 for the year is an easy payment to make. The last two years I've just shrugged and payed it rather than deal with it.",1294923721

Then the compiler can use a simple common subexpression elimination optimization.  The SQL 2003 standard does this with functions in order to aid the implementor's compiler/optimizer ability to optimize functions that don't modify or read any data and are purely functional.",1294923685

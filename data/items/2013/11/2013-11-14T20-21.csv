It doesn&#x27;t exist and has no purpose without other people&#x27;s content. However, it is not the content that the search engine is serving, it is serving the ability to search that content, which is something completely different. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s meant by transformative, and there are many many things that could not exist if you could not take other people&#x27;s ideas, transform them substantially, and release the results.<p>Copyright and fair use is a balancing act, and I agree with Judge Chin that the benefits to having all of the printed word fully searchable (someday, at least) is a middling loss for the content creators and a huge gain for the public.<p>To address your specific analogy: you aren&#x27;t being deprived of being able to release your work, and they aren&#x27;t releasing your work with ads inserted, so I don&#x27;t think it really applies. Google Books doesn&#x27;t have ads today, but I wouldn&#x27;t have any problem with them on the search results page (just like I have no problem with (text) ads on web search results pages) since they are in fact providing content very distinct from your copyrighted work.",1384462726

I know there&#x27;s been at several cases where we specifically lost because of lack of imprint, but another thing I&#x27;ve learned in dealing with the credit card issuers is that, despite what we hope, there is MASSIVE inconsistency in the application of chargeback rules.

Depending on the exact card and terminal implementation a transaction would either use the default application or get an on-screen display asking you which you would like to use. But you&#x27;d have to get the banks to load the app on there as there are sensitive keys involved.<p>That&#x27;s not exactly the same as Coin - you couldn&#x27;t pre-select which card to use in which situation, and you couldn&#x27;t load them yourself.

* Coin essentially skims cards (through the reader) to playback for terminals. I don&#x27;t see how they can say with a straight face that it is less susceptible to the same techniques.

Devices like Square Reader just encode the magstripe as audio into an iPhone&#x27;s mic input.

According to my guide, grand masters can effortlessly memorize the positions of realistic matches. But for &quot;nonsensical chess matches&quot; where the positions were randomly generated, the masters were just as bad at recall as the noobs. From this data, my guide inferred that masters rely on recalling attack-patterns from their experience more than brute-force calculation. Similar to how a tourney-strength player has openings memorized by heart, I imagine that a master recognizes common middle-game patterns like the back of his hand.",1384460758

Then there&#x27;s stuff like tip vortices etc. So just one big rotor is great.<p>The problem becomes control. With many small rotors you don&#x27;t need to control blade pitch, as the electric motors have high torque and the blades are light, so you can control with quick engine thrust changes. And it&#x27;s that what makes the quad rotor system much more attractive than a normal helo. The traditional helicopter pitch control system is complex and requires precise high stress components that are well built and maintained.<p>But it&#x27;s a very inelegant brute force system in my opinion. The pitch control could be improved a lot as well if you have powerful electromagnetics with very precise control.<p>You still need a tail rotor though.<p>The real helicopter is seeing some real progress at the moment as well, all in the name of higher speeds. There&#x27;s Sikorsky&#x27;s X2 and AVX&#x27;s modified Kiowa. They have coaxial main rotors with a pushing tail rotor and two pushing fans respectively.
Then there&#x27;s tilt rotors by Bell and Boeing, IIRC. These were, at least at some point, all part of a US scout helicopter competition.

This will lead to chargebacks in favor of the customer. So this alone kills this company/product.<p>() Banks might change their terms forbidding customers to create digital copies / clones of their card. As per card holder agreements, if you (or Coin) has ever read one, you don&#x27;t own your card. You&#x27;re fully bound by the terms of the agreement.<p>() There is the issue of PCI-DSS compliance. They mention they&#x27;re &quot;in the process of earning&quot; it but this is a lengthy, difficult and _costly_ process ($100 k). They&#x27;re using a loophole to ensure consumer peace of mind but this won&#x27;t last at all.<p>() Adding a card seems flawed. You&#x27;re asked to take a picture of the physical card after swiping to &quot;prevent fraud&quot; ok but unless Coin uses some advanced image processing/OCR to validate the card with the swiped data, you can take a picture of any card. So big fail here.<p>() Coin seems to access a cloud service. Another major reason that this simply isn&#x27;t going to work. If you&#x27;ve paid any attention to the NSA situation within the past 6-months, ordinary/average consumers (not the HN crowd) are becoming weary of cloud/hosted service. Not to mention, Coin will never ever work outside of the US (or San Francisco for that matter).<p>Practical usability problems:<p>() Most users are totally fine with credit cards and big wallets. It&#x27;s actually empowering to them. I spoke to a guy who loves the fact that he has every color Amex card! So in essence, this is geared towards a micro-niche of tech savvy SF/NY/LA crowd.<p>() Selecting a card by tapping the button - great. What if the waiter taps the same button? Or someone you&#x27;re paying does? So many issues with this button here.<p>&quot;Weve designed the button to toggle cards in a way that makes it difficult to trigger a &quot;press&quot; unintentionally&quot; -- yeah, well most of the time, credit card fraud is an intentional act. What a stupid response. And quite frankly, offensive to anyone with half a brain.<p>() The obvious issue of losing Coin and losing everything. People like backups. It&#x27;s a mindset.<p>() Battery issues with digitizing a non-battery product (credit card). Be in no doubt that more than half of users will forget to charge their credit card (as if we don&#x27;t have enough things to charge). So you&#x27;ll see people having lunches and presenting a dead Coin. And since you don&#x27;t have any plastic, well, now you&#x27;re screwed.<p>Products are supposed to make life better, easier, more intuitive.<p>Conceptually, it sort of makes sense. But the execution is flawed in so many ways.<p>You&#x27;re being sold a product that now requires more steps than you did before. And that is the killer fellow HN&#x27;ers.<p>I don&#x27;t want to have to sync, take photos, select a card by pushing a button, make sure it&#x27;s within range to my device, update the app when needed for it to work, deal with merchants who won&#x27;t take it, CHARGE my credit card (!), deal with issues because I tapped/selected the wrong card - vs - take out and swipe.

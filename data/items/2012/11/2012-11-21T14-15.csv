4814438,comment,4813416,4813416,9,0,btilly,,,"I think that you ALMOST have it.  You've even explained the following tantalizing quote from July:  <i>I think we could actually make it self-powering if you put solar panels on it, you generate more power than you would consume in the system. There's a way to store the power so it would run 24/7 without using batteries. Yes, this is possible, absolutely.</i>  The cars in the loop store power.  A lot of it.<p>Now why do I say almost?  Let's make one small modification.  Let's put a lot of one way flaps in the tube so that it is easy for a puff of air to blow out, but not so easy for air to come back in.  There would be leakage, but that is going to be OK.<p>As each car comes by, it piles up air in front of it that blows out of the flaps.  Then the flaps fall back, and maintains a partial vacuum.  The partial vacuum is no problem for people because there is a pile of air in front of their car that can be tapped for breathing air, that can then be released backwards, where it circulates through the tube (and probably out the flap).<p>This makes his evacuated tube comment even more of a teasing joke.  No, the tube is not evacuated.  Nor did you pump air out of it.  But it winds up almost evacuated.  However it is still fine for breathing.<p>Now the point is that reduced air pressure inside of the tunnel significantly reduces drag caused by the air dragging on the edges of the tunnel and being pushed by the cars.  This does a lot to make the whole thing massively more efficient.  Elon's claim is then that it is efficient enough that it can be powered by solar panels placed on the tube.<p>My big question is how hot it will be.  There may be very little gas in the tube, but that gas will be very, very hot.  Over time the cars will heat up as well.  So you'd need to have the cars regularly coming in and out of the system so that they would have time to cool down.<p>The practical difficulties in building this are immense.  But I do not see any physical reason why it is impossible.",1353509850

4814432,comment,4814187,4814378,2,0,grotos,,,"I don't know it this is what you need to know, but:<p>As far as the front wing is concerned:
- the bigger, the more complicated means more downforce thus enabling drivers to go faster in a corner but such wing leads to more dangerous situations, such as puncturing oponent's tires.
The bigger wings were introduced in 2009 when many parts of the cars were streamlined in order to improve overtaking and reduce dependency on aerodynamics.<p>The rear wing:
- DRS was introduced 2 years ago. It stands for Drag Reduction System - driver can ""open"" rear wing to reduce drag (downforce is reduced). Basically means that rear wing is split horizontally into two smaller wings. This system improves top speed so it can be only used on straight lines. The failure of this system can lead to lost of control of the car in non-straight parts of the circuit.
The usage of this system is heavily reduced by regulations.",1353509735

The 20% state tax is only paid on <i>income in excess of 401 100</i> something that is always conveniently forgotten when discussing taxes. E.g. the tax scale is progressive which is to offset the trend that the more you earn, the likelier you have other incomes such as investments returns which are taxed significantly lower than salary tax. Yes, Sweden still has high taxes but the situation is not nearly as bad as you make it out to be.",1353509604

The article suggests that you bundle many sizes of the same image into the same file; say, a 1024x1024 version as well as a 512x512 version. This means that a browser that only wants the 512x image will also download the 1024x image whether it wants to or not. So why not just pick the 1024x image and resize it on the client size, if everyone is going to download it? This is something that today's chips do very fast.

It is well known that pieces of all the planets end up on other planets due to being ejected during meteor impacts and eventually landing on the other ones. We know this, because we have found some of the ones that have landed on Earth. It is a reasonable hypothesis that certain hardy bacteria could conceivably survive the trip. If Mars was ever hospitable to live, there is a plausible path for simple Earth life to get there.<p>So in the event Martian life is discovered, there's still some work to be done; is it ""just"" Earth life that got there, albeit presumably heavily-adapted, or can it be established that it is not from the same line as Earth? The second one is the real jackpot question that has profound implications for our place in the universe. The first one, less so. Not zero, but definitely less so.

Everything is almost all inclusive. Food, drinks, shuttles. Some early birds tickets are still available, get quick!<p>More information on http://takeoffconf.com<p>The call for papers is still open and is the following :<p>[CFP]
Take Off is a conference for passionate web developers and designers about trending topics for the upcoming year. From server side to pure front end through mobile, from design and philosophy to new languages, frameworks or development techniques, Take Off is your chance to show the world how the future of development and design should be.<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to : code (all languages are welcome !) - server-side or front-end, web experiments, tools and frameworks, new cloud usages, new user interface innovations, typography, (practical) innovations in user interfaces and data visualisation.<p>We are a bunch of open-minded guys and gals waiting to discover what's hot and new.<p>Our people using Ruby enjoy discovering new tricks in Javascript or Python (and vice-versa), our backend geeks enjoy scaling their virtual machines while coding cool data visualisation dashboards with HTML5's canvas tag and our web designers want to know how to deploy.<p>The attendees will know how to code and what we want is to give them the opportunity of launching new projects with new approaches in 2013, especially if it means switching a langage or shifting to a new platform...<p>Please email us at hello@takeoffconf.com with your proposal, with one email per proposal !<p>We do have an open proposal policy.

4814273,comment,4813734,4813853,1,0,lukeck,,,"I could have been clearer in my original post. Let me clarify by addressing your points.<p>1. People get into planes and cars every day routinely because we have been using these technologies for decades. Any new technology that comes along will be held to much higher expectations of safety and quality than currently available modes of transport were at their inception. Understanding the risks and learning how to mitigate them to an acceptable level will take some time but we should be able to get some of the benefits of high speed transport earlier.<p>2. I'm not suggesting making an unsafe for humans version or a version with incompatible design goals. At some point on the path towards having a system that is acceptably safe for humans, there must be a system that is safe enough to send non-human cargo so why not take advantage of that? Having a real functional system would allow larger scale testing that could provide very useful feedback when trying to work out all the kinks before human passengers get on board.<p>3. Good point. I've got no idea of the scale of any impact on road usage that this would have. It may or may not be a compelling goal by itself, but as a side effect of implementing technology that is a necessary stepping stone to transporting people, it could at least be a nice bonus. Negative PR from job losses comes along with many disruptive technologies and is generally an area where there's lots of room for improvement.<p>Shipping may be invisible to most but people do notice the ease of access to goods, in their availability and price. The eventual possibility of cheaper same-day shipping over large distances sounds okay to me. This doesn't have the same direct impact to an individual as being able to travel that far or fast themselves but its a start. I might be going out on a limb here but it seems to me that having faster means of moving goods around at large scale should make much more efficient distribution of resources possible. That's something we can all benefit from.<p>I'd be disappointed if Elon did shy away from the goal of a new form of human transportation but no one has said that's what SpaceX are doing when they send unmanned capsules up to the ISS.<p>Replacing a rail freight line with a system that can potentially move physical goods at the scale of road freight at twice the speed of air freight, and doing it cheaply, could be Hyperloop's minimum viable product.",1353507346

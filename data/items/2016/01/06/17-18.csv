I shoot digital but I&#x27;d like to shoot film too. The reality is that there are some artifacts that film gives you that you can&#x27;t replace in digital <i>yet</i>. In art, if the effect or feeling that you want is given on a certain tool then that is the tool for the job. In photography, if this is film, then film is the right tool for the job. There&#x27;s also the large factor of workflows. People get used to a workflow that influences their style and it&#x27;s important to them to maintain that workflow. What is measurably better in technical terms is not important.<p>What I see happening is that market trends like this will push digital forces to perfectly re-creating classic films. The difficulty with re-creating film with filters or presets is it&#x27;s notoriously hard to do and usually not perfect. Fujifilm is a perfect example of this with their film simulation modes on their X-Mount camera lineup. I suspect that the film trend is going to push photography giants into creating more accurate emulation of film baked into their workflows and devices rather than the current trend of generic hipster Instagram filters or playing in Lightroom for a few hours (and still not getting the effect you want).<p>Whether you&#x27;re a professional or a 16y/o girl with a K1000 and mix-matched 80&#x27;s leg warmers film still does have a place amongst people and this will in turn affect the development of digital processing.",1452102647

There are so many projects where a few programmers spend say 1.5 years building a components and hypothetically the application is feature complete,  but they are nowhere near running it on a real server or packing it up for the customer with an installer and all that and it takes another 0.5-1 yr to figure out how to make a release.<p>Then there is a stressful process of making a few more releases to fix the inevitable problems,  then they go off and work another 2 yrs on the next release and then find they&#x27;ve forgotten how to make a release.  The best thing about scrum is that it avoids that.<p>The idea that the phony deadline is fixed is another problem.  If you can slip the schedule by 2 or 3 days in scrum to address critical things in the scope there that is no problem but many agilists will fight that.<p>Another failure mode is the project that is hitting the goals for milestones well (estimating things about 10% accurately) and that makes people feel good, but somehow you never get to the last milestone.<p>I came in late and helped finish one of those severely troubled projects where there was a huge amount of blame to go around.  Scrum and Kanban concepts were being used by teams involved,  but a lot of people on my team including the boss and star programmer would not do what scrum required.  My boss would bitch me out for making &quot;rediculous&quot; estimates of 4 hours to do something that involved a 45 minute build process and I wondered how the other people on the team didn&#x27;t have this and I found I was the only one who was serious about estimating and that the star programmer did not do it at all.<p>In the end we gave up on scrum and got heavy on checklists.  We made a checklist with about 300 steps for a release process and it a was a stressful process but we learned how to do it reliably.  Also we had a checklist of things to have done before the final release.<p>It was not pretty but we did cross the finish line and get the product in front of customers and they liked it,  so I felt I did my part and felt free to move on when it was done.",1452102585

Then, you compose these in a semi-functional way to describe overall system. Seems the miTLS people did something similar for theirs that they call &quot;composite, state machines.&quot; The result was clean implementation and verification of what got really messy in other protocol engines.

Including self-driving cars.<p>I took a comparative world religion a long time ago; I can&#x27;t easily find the handy behavior list we had to memorize.  We were taught something vaguely Mandaville-ian, I don&#x27;t know if that outlook is still current and cool, but at least you can find Mandaville&#x27;s opinion in the wikipedia.  The &quot;aspects&quot; section of the wikipedia religion article would be a good start.<p>Shared faith based belief in the inevitability of some rather objectively unrealistic future outcome, in this case &quot;We&#x27;re all gonna use self driving cars&quot;, critically based solely on faith.  A mythology, using the &quot;a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true&quot; wiki definition, where progress has always happened in the past and therefore will always happen in the future, when reality is progress only comes from obtaining and using energy, and our petroleum is running out while our population expands, so you do the math on the realistic future trajectory of progress, furthermore there&#x27;s no question in the religion about the narrative that progress necessarily automatically equals self driving cars, instead of &quot;busses and trains and subways&quot; or not commuting at all or whatever.  There&#x27;s a fair amount of superstition involved aka everything the general public or journalists say about anything technical, legal, or economic WRT the topic of self driving cars, they&#x27;re just making unreasoned noises at each other.  Its always accompanied by extensive and exhaustive ethical baggage, in this case about preferred lifestyles, the value of work, urban planning, as if the self driving car is actually important relative to VPN deployment or subsidized public transit or star trek style transporters, yet despite its irrelevance there&#x27;s a great pile of associated ethical baggage and related extreme judgment.  There&#x27;s a strong self policing society, where certain aspects of the religion are strongly amplified via endless ceremonial repetition, and the not-devout-enough are tossed out or punished via ridicule or otherwise.<p>Note that you can discuss self driving cars in non-religious ways, much as you can scientifically study aspects of a religion.  That doesn&#x27;t mean the adherents are not thinking/believing, communicating, and organizing in a religious style or manner, that just means you looked at them from a non-religious perspective.<p>Some historical religions being a little hard to believe in the modern scientific world, doesn&#x27;t mean all religions are false; quite possibly we will have self driving cars in the future.  That future success won&#x27;t be a disproof of past observational behavior, under the &quot;walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it IS a duck&quot; doctrine of what is a religion.  Praying to each other for deliverance in the form of a self driving car won&#x27;t bring it here any faster, but if it does somehow arrive anyway, the physical manifestation of that idol/miracle doesn&#x27;t prove the praying was the cause of the effect/idol/miracle.",1452101774

Even if it&#x27;s silky smooth and you can use it for hours on end without issue if you run out of quality content in two hours there&#x27;s a problem. Quantity/quality are even more important to the user after making such a significant investment.<p>The problem here is if developers will be able to make money creating quality experiences for Oculus if the userbase is tiny because no one can afford one. The user market is already being fractured by the different units available - if I develop a game for the HTC Vive (which supports room tracking) is it easy or even possible to port the experience to the Oculus?<p>Developing a high quality gaming experience is EXPENSIVE, and AAA regularly do not recoup their costs even when they&#x27;re being offered to a huge user base (XBOX/PS4/PC/etc). Due to the nature of VR a quality experience is going to require a significant investment to build. If companies can&#x27;t recoup that cost they&#x27;ll stop developing and if there aren&#x27;t any killer experiences people will stop buying the Rift.<p>For Oculus (or any of the upcoming units) to be successful they need to walk the line between quality and price, and I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;ve done it.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think Sony is in a better position even though it&#x27;s looking like they have inferior hardware.",1452101486

10851884,comment,10849458,10849458,0,0,jerf,,,"It is, in some sense, a very simple problem. When and if we advance to the point that AI algorithms are themselves capable of writing AI algorithms, what happens then? Quantify (albeit vaguely) the rate at which AI algorithms can improve AI algorithms. If that number turns out to be roughly as slow as human beings, there&#x27;s no significant problem. If it turns out that number is greatly larger than human beings, that&#x27;s a problem.<p>It is not particularly clear than the number is large; hard problem is hard. No sarcasm; arguably &quot;general intelligence&quot; is the hardest possibly engineering problem. Adding a bit more intelligence to the problem when it will already be getting worked on by a lot of humans may not move the needle much to speak of at all. But it is not particularly clear that that rate is small either, though; humans are smart, yet at the same time, really dumb in a lot of ways. We have terrible working memory (7 +/- 2 items is absurdly small). We have lots of irrational biases. We have lots of things to do in our lives that are not &quot;thinking&quot; (eating, sleeping, etc.), and the vast majority of our brain is dedicated to those problems, not rational thought. We are terrible at manipulating vast symbol systems without taking immense shortcuts, which inevitably completely color our manipulations. What happens when something that lacks those restrictions is turned loose on the problem of writing AI algorithms?<p>Heck if I know. I&#x27;m a human too.<p>I honestly think that those people who are utterly convinced the rate must necessarily be slow are just as wrong as those who are utterly convinced it must necessarily be fast. We really don&#x27;t know, <i>but</i> it is hardly an invalid concern.<p>So far, AI algorithms have not written very many AI algorithms. I&#x27;ve seen some toys where one AI algorithm is hooked up to tune another one, but I&#x27;m not sure if any of them have ever been practically useful. (All I know is all the ones I&#x27;ve personally seen have amounted to toys.)

He has a mastery that continues to have value.  He may find all of that blunted in the digital realm.  Can&#x27;t blame him.<p>I think we will eventually find the art in high resolution digital comes down to things other than perfection.  Sometimes too much of a good thing is too much.<p>On another thread, I mentioned Pink Floyd, &quot;The Wall&quot; and how it has been reissued on CD and a remastered gold version that is insane good.<p>Actually, it is too good.  The average person may well appreciate the production values from the earlier work more, despite its considerable distance from perfection.<p>The trouble on all these discussions centers in on what people like as opposed to perfection.  Those two are not always the same, and &quot;better&quot; has that subjective component to it always.<p>Many digital movie productions I see have subtle aspects to them one can find distracting or that break the immersion a movie is supposed to deliver.  Not breaking that is Cinematography.  I remain unconvinced everyone really understands that.<p>That&#x27;s where the art is.<p>This is not to say advances in tech are bad or to be discouraged.  Neither is true.<p>However, value perception of said tech may vary considerably from expectations.<p>On your last point, we actually lose the pixel art, and often the discussion goes to other things.  Fine, but it&#x27;s not always bad to see the pixels.<p>With gaming, extreme realism, or just extreme quality, can break some of the escape and fantasy, abstraction inherent in the entertainment form.  There is definitely room for both and an active retro culture and indie scene taking liberally from retro in order to see that art continue.<p>The are also some economies with analog means.  I&#x27;m on a chip project right now that can offer up great analog display.  (Truth is, it will do a 4k on analog, no sweat, if one wants to do that)<p>Some of that is lost on digital devices.  The thing is, generating the analog is at least an order more lean, while being able to offer comparable quality.  Barrier to entry is low.  That is also high value.<p>Raising that bar is good in many cases, but not all.  So I find myself dealing with many subtle timing matters, artifacts of A to D conversion all a non issue on actual analog displays.  I will end up with a lean device that can do HDTV signals nicely, while still maxing out an old TV, which does way more than most expect, and do so sans an awful lot of hassles.<p>As a &quot;do it myself&quot; kind of person, I do not always see the benefit of complex, resource intensive signals, compression, etc... as a good, or the better thing.  And there are IP concerns too, all near completely absent from analog means and methods.<p>So then, &quot;better&quot; takes on some new depth when on is making or building from first principles.  In the end, the system will deliver a great display for a fraction of the effort required to employ a fully digital path.<p>That&#x27;s tech I know down to the core, can trust and control in any way desired.  Does exactly what I want.  High value as far as I am concerned.  Timeless too.  Works on anything ever made.<p>I just got a media player that refuses to interface with my other goodies.

We generally move through those stages throughout our daily lives. Animals display wide variations in qualities of self-awareness as well. So we can define consciousness as the sum of all of these qualities.<p>What I think is going to happen is that we&#x27;ll start separating out lots of aspects of consciousness and explore them in software, adding more and more of them in as the state of the art of hardware gets better. The consciousness algorithms will slowly, over time, shed complexity.<p>Eventually, well before we get to even human-level self-awareness, we&#x27;ll run into hard physical limits and realize that biology is way more effective at making the sort of compact, yet incredibly complex evolved system than any design process could be.<p>Biology has an advantage we don&#x27;t have, it does not have to understand what it is doing, and it works ceaselessly.

But as crazy as this might sound, JavaScript is an implementation detail of the Node platform, not a defining characteristic. For instance, there&#x27;s a project [1] that replaces JavaScript in Node with Lua.<p>But if you go back to the origin story of Node, it&#x27;s all about libev (though it now uses libuv for the same purpose) and that pervasively-asynchronous mindset. JavaScript was chosen as the developer interface because it met the need to support that asynchronous philosophy. The result is that everything in the Node world is asynchronous and asynchronous is the path of least resistance for the developer. Other platforms that weren&#x27;t conceived with this mindset often force developers to fight to be asynchronous.<p>> It seems like whether you&#x27;re aiming for ease/speed of prototyping, pure performance, a good concurrency model...<p>It&#x27;s a mistake to look at JavaScript as a fit for all of this. Instead, you should consider how the Node platform fills the need. For easy of prototyping, it&#x27;s not JavaScript that makes Node excel, it&#x27;s npm. The only package management system I&#x27;ve found that I prefer to npm is Rust&#x27;s Cargo. And npm is still well ahead of Cargo in the richness of the package ecosystem. For pure performance, you can always write a native Node addon [2]. And, as mentioned, while JavaScript isn&#x27;t concurrent at all, the Node platform provides the concurrency model in a way that has proven to be scalable but without most of the pain that comes with writing concurrent code. Writing concurrent code is hard...that&#x27;s not news. The Node framework make writing concurrent code significantly easier by creating abstractions that hide the the fact that code is concurrent.<p>I know it&#x27;s bizarre to look at it this way, since you would be writing most of your application logic in JavaScript, but try to look at it as an implementation detail and consider the advantages of the Node platform and the ecosystem that surrounds it. When you take this perspective, Node becomes a lot more attractive than the JavaScript language is on its own.<p>[1] <a href=""https://luvit.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://luvit.io/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html</a>",1452099916

The believers in the AI threat normally perceive themselves to be different from other people due to their (self-perceived or real) higher intelligence. They therefore describe that property (that they believe makes them special) as being particularly dangerous, and therefore powerful, because they want to believe that intelligence imbues its possessor with power and a lot of it. Sadly, superbugs, meteorites, H bombs, climate change, human-rights violations, inequality and other threats don&#x27;t require or possess much intelligence, but an unstoppable AI is the purest manifestation of intelligence-as-power.<p>In the human world, intelligence is not very correlated with power, except very roughly. The most powerful people are generally more intelligent than average, but the correlation doesn&#x27;t extend far beyond that. If anything, charm, confidence and courage seem to imbue their bearers with much more power than raw intelligence. Which is why I fear (only partly jokingly) a super-charming machine than a super-intelligent one.

Airplanes weren&#x27;t a practical means of travel in 1910, but by 1960 it was a different story, and some people in 1910 had already realized that plane travel was coming.<p>Secondly, it does a lot of handwaving about &quot;religion&quot;. I am an atheist, and think most religious beliefs are irrational. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean that every belief that &quot;looks like&quot; religion (in some vague, poorly-defined way) is irrational. The Aztec religion was false, but Hernan Cortes and his army of men with guns was very real. It would have been stupid for Aztec atheists to ignore Cortes because &quot;that sounded like religion&quot;. The right question to ask is &quot;is this claim supported by the evidence?&quot;, not &quot;how much like religion does this claim sound?&quot;.",1452099718

Of course, it&#x27;s also fueled by a lot of hype and hand-wavy statements about exponential growth and the like.<p>Like many other aspects of AI, I&#x27;m not sure just about anyone thinks we need to have strong AI to make self-driving cars work under the vast majority of conditions. We &quot;just&quot; need to create automation that can handle a reasonable number of corner cases without flipping out or grinding to a halt. But that&#x27;s a debate about engineering timelines not something more philosophical.",1452099698

You are much better off making 1 bet per year and then stopping, than lot&#x27;s of little ones.  EX: I am up over my lifetime on slot machines.  How? I did a few bets on a fixed amount got slightly lucky <i>and never played again.</i><p>That said, if your doing this for entertainment then minimizing the money your betting is reasonable.

Might have to make a revised version of it.<p>Many of them are hardware-related but you can&#x27;t solely blame it on proprietary hardware. The times where work was put in got things done. Tons of work has been put into Linux with all kinds of features and fixes. There&#x27;s even enterprise distro&#x27;s aimed at business desktops bringing in revenue. Yet, core functionality for desktops has problems it&#x27;s had for a long time that can only be explained by lack of effort.<p>So, author&#x27;s (and my) point still stands even after knocking out bad references or ignoring truly hardware-specific problems. If you doubt it, just check out autotools to see the state of software maintenance that sometimes shows up in FOSS UNIX&#x27;s. ;)",1452099601

Goes out of her way to please everyone, sacrifices greatly, terrible financials.  All because she loves the attention that is bestowed upon her.

Thinking that you start with 0 is IMHO a fallacy (if you are staying within the same industry). If you are no antisocial you have made at least 1-2 (or better: 10-20) good friends at college/school with whom you can team up, or build your network. If you haven't, reach out to your ex project group partners.<p>Many ex-students think that they don't deserve high wages yet  - ""I have to learn X,Y,Z,... until I can demand X$"". Thing is that we never stop learning, and you HAVE to charge money for learning. Projects are by definition a nonrecurring enterprise (else you could fully automate the outcome), so there will always be things to learn to finish it.<p>If you think that your skills are not worth a lot of money, you will not even try and demand it - that makes it exactly a zero chance of earning a lot. For many people the only thing that separates them from earning much is their self-confidence (or confidence in their skills) - or choice of wrong market/industry (what are my talents?), but that's a different post.",1331402343

3688240,comment,3688098,3688098,1,0,EdwardCoffin,,,"I suggest starting with a simple, straightforward representation for the data model, and start programming the functionality you want.  As you implement this functionality, you will encounter pain-points which make you wish you'd used a different representation.  After a number of these, you may have some ideas for a different, more appropriate representation you wish you'd used.  If the two representations are close enough, you may be able to just refactor what you have into this new form, then continue.  If they are different enough, declare what you have done so far a learning experience, abandon it, and start over, using your new idea(s) for a new representation.<p>I can think of two different major projects I've done in the past five years in which I started again from scratch, after major revelations made it clear to me that it was the right thing to do.  In one I settled on the third object model, and the other I know I did at least two.  These were quick iterations though: I settled on the third and final object model within a month of starting, and the project completed in seven months, so it's not like I was throwing out that much work.<p>Avoid premature optimization with all your might.<p>Fowler's book Refactoring might be helpful with ideas of how to morph data models.<p>A couple of quotations from More Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley:<p>""Plan to throw one away, you will anyhow.""

The proxy server works in concert with a client on the tethered machine, and the script just relays data between those two connections.<p>The interesting thing is that iOS permits a single web page to connect over both network links simultaneously.

You'd expect that she is of the so-called lower class, but no - she's VERY intelligent and only hasn't finished her master thesis yet because she ""has so much other stuff to do"".<p>Swombat casually mentioned that success might be a lifelong habit - in her case it seems that UNsuccess can also be a habit. Whenever a decision comes along, she decides for what's good for others.

She also hates money, and starts inviting people for dinner (who earn a lot more than her) whenever she got some  to spare.

Such sacrificing personalities are well thought-of in our society. Many people admire her for her ability to work 15h a day, while earning almost nothing. But it's a life I would never want to lead.<p>Recently, her life has finally improved, and she has been forced to earn more so her husband is allowed to move to Austria.

As someone who's spent a lot of time scrutineering elections, here's how the day runs down.<p>1. I show up before the polls open, sign myself in, and have the opportunity to look inside each of the ballot boxes. Once I (and other people from other parties doing this) all agree they're empty, the boxes are taped up and the polls open.<p>2. Over the course of the day, people come and go and vote. At any time, I can continue to be sitting and walking around the room supervising things.<p>3. At the end of the day (when the polls close) the deputy returning officer closes the doors, leaving only the election workers and any observers inside the room. At that point we (the DRO and the scrutineers) go from table to table verifying that the tape is intact, cutting it open, dumping the pile of ballots on the table, and verifying that the box is empty.<p>4. The clerks for each poll count the ballots. It's rare for there to be disagreements on who a vote should count for (all ballots look like <a href=""http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=yth/stu/gui&document=dx&lang=e#8c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=yth...</a>, with that circle on the right being about an inch in diameter), thought it happens. When it does, we (the representatives of the parties) discuss who we think the vote was for, but ultimately the poll clerk decides. Generally one of the partisan observers objects to this, which his noted in the log.<p>5. Once all the ballots are counted, the poll clerks fill out a mathematical worksheet to make sure all the numbers (ballots counted, electors checked off, unused ballots, and ballot stubs) match. About half the time these numbers don't, so we recount everything a few times until they do.<p>5. Each partisan representative gets a carbon copy of the official return form (specifying the result of the poll), and witnesses the DRO calling the results into the regional office.<p>6. Everything is packaged up on a per-poll basis (used and unused ballots, paperwork, etc.) into a nested series of plastic envelopes, which everyone signs along the seals. These are kept for a few years for auditing.<p>One of the main benefits of this system is that it's dead-simple, and the counting can be explained to anyone - which is something that many proponents of cryptographic voting don't sufficiently take into account. As for making ti difficult to trace back where fraud took place, I'd say that's almost a selling point. If you could work backwards to exactly where someone faked something, it seems like it would be only a small step further to be able to work out who people individually for.",1331401030

It's long been predicted that the next large-scale war will be over water supplies; there are already a number of simmering conflicts that go back to access to water.<p>Why are we running out of resources? Significantly, because there's too many people for the resources we have.<p>Why do we have too many people? Explosive population growth over the past 100-150 years, particularly in the last 50. World population has gone up nearly 50% in 25 years.<p>What's historically been the best way of arresting population growth? War; kill lots of people. Hmm, not really an acceptable plan. What's the next best? Education, in particular <i>female</i> education.<p>Now, at its core I agree with your point that the list was under-ambitious. Well, let's refine that - only <i>parochially</i> ambitious. So let's go big. We want a sustainable, long-term end to hunger and world peace.<p>What do we do for that? Give a man to fish - teach a man to fish. Food parcels and free medicine are a sticking plaster - necessary in the short-term, insufficient in the long-term. Fair trade helps but alone is improving their position at the bottom of the supply chain. Get improved education and access to knowledge though and we enable a long-term culture shift that both better equips the presently impoverished for the future and attacks the root causes of the resource instability that currently so impoverish them.<p>Which is where projects like OLPC and the Indian tablets are so important, and where (if done properly), the startup idea to replace universities is the biggest and most important on the list.

In fact, I'm not even sure that my understanding is correct.<p>The problem with not using new data to test each new prediction is, that if a scientist wants to show A on data X, but data X doesn't confirm A, the scientist modifies A slightly and now tests A' on X, which is again rejected, and then modifies it again, testing A'' on X, and so on... until the data X actually confirms hypothesis A'''''''!<p>That's the real problem - using data without a predefined plan for how you will use this data. In the above example, the data that you collected affected your decision-making process, so your results are not independent of the data (and thus not replicable!).",1331399476

3688128,comment,3686840,3687080,12,0,bane,,,"Similar, but different story. In the 800s, looking for an immortality elixir, man discovers a solid black chemical explosive. In time (around 1132), this finds itself as an early propellant in ranged missiles. Later it uses in other applications: mining, firearms, entertainment, bombs and myriad others.<p>But the use as missile propellant remains. Looking for similar, but more powerful propellants for these missiles (to give them more kinetic impact, longer range, and other properties).<p>Progress was slow until the late 19th and early 20th centuries when liquid fueled rockets were invented as well as an entire host of various chemical explosives with vastly different properties.<p>Progress was rapid, and soon missiles could travel hundreds of miles, and had enough extra capacity to deliver even more powerful explosives to their target.<p>However, accuracy was poor at best. Various types of complex control systems were designed and built into the missiles. As man realized that missiles could be scaled up and lift payloads up into orbit and beyond, bringing the payloads down in the desired location became even more important.<p>Inertial systems, radio control, celestial navigation and even attempts at manned guidance!<p>However, navigating is a general problem, and not just useful for missiles. Ships, people, surveyors, and others, all need to know where on the earth they are. In the 60s, with the advent of orbital missiles and satellites, a system of satellites was placed in orbit. And using a complicated collection of quartz oscillators, early computers, and various radio receiving equipment, one could (after a number of minutes collecting data and inputting it into dedicated guidance computers) determine where they were on Earth to accuracy of a few hundred meters.<p>Enter the nuclear age which gave us ultra-precise clocks, combined with transistors, then integrated circuits and all segments of the navigation problem were improved. By 1978, these components were small and reliable enough that missiles pushed constellation after constellation of satellites into orbit. Ground receivers were small enough to fit into the bodies of other missiles enabling them to navigate to targets with accuracy in the single meters with constant positional fixes along the flight path.<p>Realizing that the navigation computers and radios were now small enough to fit on a missile, it also meant they could be fit onto ships, large aircraft, and large trucks.<p>Later improvements to atomic timekeeping, computers, radios and other pieces meant that the receivers could be made man carry-able and fit into backpacks, small vehicles and on and on. Accuracy was improved to inches, and missiles could suddenly be dropped into selected air vents in specific buildings.<p>Except suddenly nobody cared as much about moving missiles, they found that knowing where they and their stuff was in the world was far more interesting and useful. Further improvements in computing meant that the navigational radios and computers could fit into a handheld device, then be integrated with high quality geospatial data, heuristic path finding algorithms and suddenly we have satnav in our cars.<p>Reusing the same navigation tech and we find we can improve the geospatial data considerably, improving navigation. Fixing these devices to the ground and we can measure plate tectonics for the first time, track fleets of vehicles in real-time, saving millions of dollars in fuel, compute phasors in power lines improving power delivery systems, ultra precise atomic clocks means precise time synchronization (with accuracy +-10 ns).<p>Further improvements in miniaturization puts navigation into handheld phones, and suddenly we know what restaurants are nearby. Tie it to a database collecting reviews and we know if it's good. Tied to the previously developed navigation system and we can even get walking directions there.<p>In other words, most people don't need to guide a missile, but they do need to find a good place to eat. And when the technology developed for busting a bunker left the avionics systems it got people and their stuff where they wanted to go faster and with less confusion than before.<p>Today it's hard to imagine a time when we didn't know the exact location of just about everything.",1331399469

I think successful people learn how to be successful through trial and error.<p>There are formulas for success and failure. Some people learn faster, some people learn slower; some lessons are better than others and get you there faster; some people are fortunate enough to be able to fail in more modest ways while they're simultaneously being successful in the grand scheme of things (Zuck). Sometimes randomosity bails you out of stupid choices, sometimes you hit the floor hard; the choice to learn or not is up to the individual either way.<p>Some people become successful early, and fail late. The list of former Forbes 400 members is littered with these people. Some people fail early, and succeed later, and for the rest of their lives, having learned their lesson.<p>In my experience, failure can feel a bit like living through a great depression. You become emotionally reflexive based on what you've learned / digested. Same way people learned to be extremely frugal after The great depression. If you learn the right lessons from it, your reflexes will keep you from making similar stupid mistakes later on.

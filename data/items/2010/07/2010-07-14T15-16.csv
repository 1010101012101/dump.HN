It is impossible to reason about what intrinsic values cause one model to be more highly touted than another because there aren't any. The value ascribed is entirely extrinsic.<p>This is the obvious way in which markets are different: even though prices get way overinflated from speculators chasing trends, there is in fact a real fundamental value buried in the noise and sooner or later the people who are good at finding that value will outweigh the noise traders and trend chasers. Then the momentum turns into fear (because none of the speculators knew what they were doing) and we have a lovely crash. It's painful and irrational but eventually enough people wake up and realize that prices are nowhere near valuation.<p>Models don't crash. They disappear, but there's no ""reckoning"" in which their popularity is brought back to true values of beauty. The momentum is the only source of value.",1279123083

Aesthetic tastes differ, and the paper does provide some anecdotes suggesting that MySpace's profiles appealed more to certain racial and socioeconomic groups.<p>However, social networks do a pretty good job at segregating - as long as your friends are bourgeois and share your bourgeois design sensibilities, you can use MySpace without bumping into too much 'profile bling'.<p>Instead, it seems that some white and Asian kids of high socioeconomic status joined Facebook because it was associated with elite universities and therefore reflected their aspirations - and once this process started, people went where their friends were, self-segregating along racial and economic lines just like they do in high school (and throughout the rest of society.)  Aesthetic tastes became a socially-acceptable <i>justification</i> for that move, but I don't think they were the primary cause.<p>That said, a good knowledge of the aesthetic preferences of various social groups could be valuable.

If you've read his books then you probably know what is coming.<p>His proposal to look at evolution from the gene point of view is something that is simple and logical to me. He points out that individuals are temporary collections of genes, and it is these genes that play games with us not the other way around. I love it how he puts; we are survival machines built by our genes.<p>However, for some reason some of those machines have developed this ability to talk to one another over things they have created. They seem to be able to reflect upon their own decisions and instincts in order to improve their response to the environment. There is no doubt that the gene/s that enable this became wildly successful in the gene pool. So, in a quirky way we have this ability given to us by genes that prevent us from carrying out the sole purpose of our existence to those genes; replication.<p>On the other hand we can argue for the-men/women-you-don't-have-sex-with example by pointing out that each time we mate there is a finite cost attached to it, and in order for the genes to be propagated most efficiently we have to take that into account. To a gene what is the use of having 30 descendants if none of them live long enough to reproduce?<p>What I am trying to say is that we aren't governed by our gene programming to the extent suggested in pop-culture. The genes themselves have given us a backdoor, and we exploit that backdoor a lot. It is an extremely strange recursion that boggles my mind.<p>So, at the end, yeah, you are right.

Ruby has a bit of a reputation for being on the slow side, and sometimes that can be an issue, but other than that, it's a general purpose language with a vibrant community, so in the end rather capable.<p>I think the difference lies more in the cultures. .NET was born out of the largest software company in the world with billions at stake. That alone ensures it will be on the conservative side. Whereas Ruby was born more in the open source and start up community, it has more freedom to just go for it. Look at Rails 3, massive changes and a general attitude of ""this new way of doing it is better, so buck up."" Which is fine, perfectly fine, for Ruby. Microsoft would never get away with that (take ASP.NET 4 for example, they went to exhaustive lengths to make sure it can be ran in ""legacy"" mode). The jump from .NET 1.1 to 2.0 was a painful one, and so was 3.5 to 4, and Microsoft knows that. Yet they still maintain admirable backwards compatibility despite all of that.

It's going to crash from time to time,  run out of memory,  and otherwise make trouble for you.<p>PHP's mode of integration with the prefork Apache web server is almost trouble-free...  It's such a big difference that there could be a ""blub"" factor here...  People who program in other environments often have a really hard time believing that a large fraction of the sysadmin activities that they are doing just don't need to be done if you're running PHP.  (You can go five years and never ""kick Tomcat"",  something that some shops have to do every 5 hours).<p>That said,  scaling comes to play here.  For a small company  or for a company that's doing a number of small projects,  the cost of system administration that comes with other programming environment matters a lot more than it does for a big company.  It's not such a big factor for a company like Facebook.<p>On the other hand,  PHP forces people into a ""shared nothing"" model that scales well and ~eliminates~ a wide range of concurrency-related problems that are endemic to thread-based backend apps.  For instance,  quite often I've seen a race condition in an ASP.NET app and had everybody on the team swear up and down that there's no shared state,  then I spend a few hours looking at the app and there's a static variable that nobody knew was there.<p>Another strength of PHP is that it has a very complete library that's largely correct.  The PHP team is much more honest about what works and what doesn't work than a lot of others (PHP and Python have the same problem with threads,  for the same reason -- PHP says ""don't use them"",  Python says ""jump in the water is fine"".)  If you program in some weird-o language like Haskell you'll probably have to write your own urldecode function and you'll probably be so busy thinking about higher-order functions you won't pay attention to details...  Like making it work right.  (Perl has a broken urldecode function in CPAN FOREVER)<p>Don't get me wrong,  there's plenty to hate about PHP;  but try to get some real work done in environment X and you'll find plenty to hate too.",1279120817

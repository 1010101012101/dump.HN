Safari, Chrome Firefox, and IE have wildly different animation performance hazards on the same markup and debugging this often isn&#x27;t trivial, for example, finding out that the GPU is stalling on texture uploads deep inside of the render loop.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8999716"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8999716</a>",1423460990

HUAC investigated all kinds of subversive organizations, including German sympathizers during WWI and the German-American Bund during WWII.<p>HUAC acted purely as an investigative body and didn&#x27;t have (and, per the Constitution, never had) the legislative power to blacklist people from working in any given career. The expectation was that HUAC would carry out the investigations to bring information to the public light. The studio executives who acted on the information discovered were doing so of their own volition; HUAC had no real power to compel them to do anything in particular.<p>House committees investigate things all the time, too; even things that are purely in the domain of the public sector.

Just as, if the owner of a basketball team were discovered to make racist comments in private to his own girlfriend, he would be immediately blacklisted from the league and forced to sell the team to Steve Ballmer and everyone would think this was OK.<p>Well, for a brief moment in American history, people figured that being a Stalinist was just as bad as people today think making racist remarks to your girlfriend or using steroids to break the home run record is, and reacted in exactly the same way.",1423460694

Inflation pushes the price of assets up, and the real value of the debt down. I agree that the assets you purchase should generate a cashflow to cover the financing drag. Inflation also increases dividends, rents and coupons.<p>Because the poor have expenses (outgoings) equal to or greater than income (wages, salary), price inflation erodes their disposable income, and price inflation is elastic, but wages are sticky, so the poor are always playing catchup, and in the interim, the rich are buying up their assets with cheap debt.",1423460340

Tie it to user pleasure, effectiveness, business metrics, anything, but citing the idea that somehow since the web was not designed with Javascript everywhere in mind meaning we should use it as the exception not the rule isn&#x27;t much more than appeal to tradition argument to me. There are definitely areas of software engineering where you can find many examples where a lack of respect for the craft, or a lack of knowledge of history/standards results in failure, but I&#x27;m just not buying the idea that if you build a SPA with a fancy new javascript framework instead of making sure NoScript works you&#x27;re somehow going to be paying for that in spades down the road because it&#x27;s breaking some set of rules handed down by the high priests. There are about a million other technical decisions that have more of an impact in a serious project. (For example, instead of arguing about SPA vs non-SPA, or what framework, or whatever, ask yourself: &quot;Is anyone on the team an expert in any particular flavor of this?&quot; If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then going with any one of those is almost certainly the best strategic decision <i>regardless</i> of the supposed merits or flaws of that particular approach.)",1423460120

That style of third rail isn&#x27;t as solidly mounted as ones where the pickup runs on top. In this accident, the third rail broke loose and penetrated the first car of the train, with the power still on.<p>There&#x27;s a solution available to prevent railroad crossing accidents, but it requires blocking the highway for much longer.[1] This is a fully interlocked grade crossing.  There are gates on both sides of the tracks, vehicle detectors for cars on the tracks, and interlocking with the railroad signals.  As a train approaches, first the bells and lights come on. Then the entrance side gates go down. The control system checks that there are no vehicles on the crossing; there are traffic detectors and radars for this. Only then do the exit side gates go down.  When all gates are fully down, and the crossing is clear of vehicles, the train gets a clear signal.  If there&#x27;s an obstruction or a damaged gate, the train will slow and stop if necessary.<p>This requires that the gates go down about a minute before the train arrives, because the stopping distance for trains is so large.  Drivers hate that. Railroads aren&#x27;t too happy with it either, because they&#x27;re going to have to stop trains when someone is still on the crossing a minute before the train gets there. Current FRA rules are that such a setup will be required for grade crossings with trains operating above 110 MPH. Only the Northeast Corridor has such speeds.<p>There&#x27;s been one accident at the US at a fully interlocked gate.  A car went through a lowered gate into the path of an Acela high speed train.[2]  Barrier gates capable of stopping a truck are being considered.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ansaldo-sts.com/sites/ansaldosts.message-asp.com/files/manuali-ansaldo/CatalogCutSheets/RSE-5A3_Quad-Gate%20Sys.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ansaldo-sts.com/sites/ansaldosts.message-asp.com/...</a><p>[2] [<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/nyregion/30acela.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/nyregion/30acela.html</a>]",1423458785

It isn’t clean or well designed by a long shot — but it is extensible and it can learn from many products built with it.&quot;<p>That _was_ the great thing about web technology: &#x27;worse is better&#x27;, but it is no longer an aspirational goal. As a developer I need a well-designed web to build on, and these modern frameworks are doing exactly that.<p>> If we do everything client-side we do not only need to deliver innovative, new interfaces. We also need to replicate the already existing functionality the web gives us. A web site that takes too long makes the browser show a message that the site is not available and the user can re-try. When the site loads, I see a spinner. Every time we replace this with a client-side call, we need to do a lot of UX work to give the user exactly the same functionality.<p>There is no &quot;Loading&quot; spinner anymore on a well-built JS-heavy application. Good frameworks (React, Ember with FastBoot) use Javascript on the server to send a fully rendered HTML to the client. That works. And they rehydrate this HTML with JSON data and client-side logic so that any further JS interaction is smooth and can be done using the conveniences of the framework.<p>But if were to follow the gist of what the article is trying to tell us, we should instead be rendering HTML using typical server-side technologies, and use progressive enhancement to add dynamism in the client. This is not a good solution: we have to duplicate rendering logic on both the client and server using two completely different stacks. It is a lot of cognitive load, needs duplication of effort, and is a maintenance nightmare.<p>A better solution is to simply render everything using Javascript, and remember that Javascript is no longer a client-side technology. Use the same Javascript to render contents both on the server and the client and rehydrate the rendered HTML transparently on the client.<p>I also disagree with the author&#x27;s implied assertion that people who use conveniences like SASS do it more because of incompetence in wielding CSS. The kinds of abstractions CSS promotes are selectors, specificity, and cascade. They are not the kind of abstractions one needs to build a maintainable and reusable body of code. We programmers know what they are: variables, modules, objects, control structures, expressions..  SASS provides some of those missing pieces: variables, mixins, conditionals and expressions. In fact SASS pushes CSS closer to a programming language than CSS is, and that is a good thing.<p>The article closes on this note:<p>> A lot of our work on the web goes pear-shaped in maintenance. This is not a technology issue, but a training one. And this is where I am worried about the nearer future when maintainers need to know all the abstractions used in our products that promise to make maintenance much easier. It is tough enough to find people to hire to build and maintain the things we have now. The more abstraction we put in, the harder this will get.<p>I&#x27;m as close to an abstraction-hater as the next person. But there are good abstractions and bad ones. Mutating DOM directly using spaghetti Javascript? That is just no abstraction. Once we understand the rendered view as a function of state, then it makes sense to have abstractions based on that idea (like one-way or two-way data binding).<p>The need for training is not a point of contention. But assume we have competent developers working in good faith, and they still find it hard to write well-maintainable code for the web, then it has to be something else that is broken. Having used these newfangled frameworks for a while now, I do think that is very much the case. Anyone should be able to put together reasonably written web-apps without being masters at the craft, but it has so far been hard, not because of people, but because of tools.",1423458527

They stuck the shuttle on a 747, and there&#x27;s no particular reason to think it couldn&#x27;t go on an A380.<p><pre><code>    > When dealing with air cargo dimensions are more

Weight and fuel efficiency are by far the most important air-cargo considerations, absolutely dwarfing _every_ _single_ other concern. Awkward loads are a miniscule edge case, which is why there was precisely 1 AN-225 built, 5 Belugas, and 4 Dreamlifters, as compared to the mind-boggling amount of air freighters, and passenger aircraft carrying freight.<p><pre><code>    > you need to engineer from the outset for a pivoting nose

The Beluga and Dreamlifter both are modified version of existing non-pivoting-nose airframes, and there&#x27;s even a 747-400 (747-400F) modification where the front lifts up.",1423458117

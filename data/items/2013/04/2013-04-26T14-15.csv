5613259,comment,5612131,5612805,1,0,Intermernet,,,"Have you by any chance seen the Futurama episode ""A Big Piece Of Garbage""?<p>A few points:<p>Onkalo is in Finland, and the storage facility is ONLY for waste from Finnish nuclear plants. It also isn't complete as far as I'm aware. I see that Sweden are also building the same style of storage facility in sthammar, but I don't see any similar construction going on in the USA, France, UK, Japan etc. It may be happening, but there definitely isn't a lot of press about it. This leads me to agree with the grand-parent's point about honesty. Surely, if this form of storage is actually a solution, everyone would be doing it and advertising loudly that they were.<p>Secondly, the KBS-3 standard's final step involves storing the waste for 100,000 years! And, according to the Wikipedia article on it (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBS-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBS-3</a>, linked from the article you provided the URL for) there were some questions raised about the copper capsules used as one of the storage layers, and the fact that the Finnish company building the Onkalo facility (Posiva, owned by the 2 main players in Finnish nuclear plants) seems to be being duplicitous in the way these questions are being dealt with. From the article ""independent research conducted in Finland has supported the results of Szaklos's group. However, in public, Posiva dismissed the independent research in Sweden and Finland, referring to its own safety studies.""<p>So, to quote the grandparent comment, ""As long as the pro-nuclear crowd circumvents addressing those concerns ... I'll be on the anti-nuclear side.""",1366988341

5613256,comment,5612043,5613057,2,0,da_n,,,"I would mostly agree with you that flat design is a new style if we limit the context to only web/application GUI's. No one can really disagree that flat design is an already historically established visual aesthetic in the real world.<p>So this is <i>digital</i> flat design. With digital there are different metaphors to consider, like user interaction, boundaries, display capabilities etc. This is the web adopting some of the best things about established design aesthetics in the real world (minimalism) and integrating them in an entirely new way to incorporate those considerations.<p>I agree that it is inevitable there will be some new design trend in a few years time (please hopefully not one that involves monstrous glossy buttons and gradients), however this current flat design feels like it is laying the groundwork, especially in how a design should be technically achieved. The flat design is naturally more vector, which makes it inherently more native to web technology (CSS, HTML). This is very different from previous web design trends I can remember  which were essentially hacks, initially involving tables, and later divs compiled from static bitmapped assets exported from Photoshop. This I believe is a new chapter in the evolution of design on the web.<p>-- Edited for clarity.",1366988298

Yes, there will be external pressures, because others can start using their code to also look for interesting results. But that's the way things should progress. The original authors will still have an enormous benefit from having a deep understanding of the code, and the techniques they used in it.<p>I'm a computer scientist. I work on systems software research. I work in industry, so I can't release most of my code. When I was a PhD student, I always released my code. I <i>wanted</i> people to try to build on what I did. In fact, releasing my code is what has actually gotten me citations - people have either used my code directly in a larger project, or they have extended and improved upon it.<p>In systems software, academics <i>always</i> release their code. They want people to use it and build on it. The frequency with which other groups are able to beat out the original authors is almost zero - understanding a non-trivial code base takes time, and if the original authors are still working on the same problem, they have an enormous advantage.<p>Your attitude protects you, but prevents other from learning from you.",1366987830

E.g. the McMansions of the megasprawl: rolling hills of former farmland are graded and leveled off, enormous balloon-like, energy inefficient stick frame houses pop up, and twice a day their inhabitants wait in lines of SUVs on the clogged roads between the exurbs and the suburban office parks. The entire enterprise is completely dependent on vast quantities of energy being available to participants in the system. People are comfortable in their SUVs and McMansions, and aspire to this lifestyle. But the environmental footprint per capita is enormous. Without some penalty for the external costs (which are long latency and hard to measure), there is nothing to slow the spread of this pattern of economic development.<p>In this light, when you say:<p><i>Energy very well may be the 20th century's internet.

But if the LTV of each member is $12.50 and you've added 12 new members, you're LTV amount is actually $150 thus making this a $50 profit.

I can't write desktop or iOS apps in Erlang. Small utility scripts are cumbersome. There seems to be no kind of strong graphics or game support for it. For web apps the lackluster performance means is not really a step up from Ruby, which I currently use, so in that area there is no reason for me to switch.<p>In fact, the only area where Erlang is really perfectly suitable is in developing fault-tolerant, concurrent, parallel, distributed systems. And yet when I do need to write such a system, I look to Go instead.<p>> <i>Don't those [commas and periods] make more sense though?</i><p>No, they really are a bad choice. First, any kind of statement terminator/separator should be unnecessary, as I have argued elsewhere. Secondly, distinguishing between two types of terminators is a bad idea because it makes editing harder. If I have<p><pre><code>    A,
    B.
</code></pre>
and I want to switch the order to:<p><pre><code>    B,
    A.
</code></pre>
then I can't just use my editor's nifty line-transposing mechanism. I have to edit each line and change the "","" into a ""."" and vice versa. It's incredibly badly thought out.<p>Really, I like Erlang, but whenever its syntax is discussed, its defenders come out of the woodwork to make arguments without ever really wanting to listen. Syntax does matter. From speaking to lots of people, I know that Erlang's antique and cantankerous syntax is the number one problem preventing people from adopting it. As long as erlangers do nothing about their syntax, it will remain a weird little language that people admire but don't use.<p>Just look at Elixir -- people actually get excited about it. Because it has a nice syntax.<p>> few languages rival Erlang's pattern matching<p>Erlang's pattern matching is cool, but its reliance on ordered lists (which it calls tuples even though the fields are unnamed) makes it less cool again.

A good (1.5+) programmer is worth <i>at least</i> $300k/year working on his own stuff, because (a) he actually gives a shit, and (b) his competence will grow faster than it would in a typical paid job.<p>So for 4 years of a good engineer's work, $1.2M is a fair sight-unseen valuation. Scale this up for team size and include existing validations from the market, and $5-10M isn't unreasonable (with a 4-year vesting period on founder equity; unvested stuff going to investors).<p>The indefinite duration to profitability is a problem, because it's such a huge unknown that renders valuation calculation a joke. When you're valuating <i>a person</i>, any number that comes without an amount of work (e.g. a duration) is meaningless.<p>I feel like an Autonomy Fund model is better. Broad-strokes overview, minus the regulatory stuff and incentive problems and adverse-selction protections: there isn't a specified time line, but you get 75% of your market salary, and investors get a <i>passive</i> 30% equity in whatever you build (including side projects, that being the one downside for employee). The going assumption is that you're worth 2.5x more to the economy when you work on your own stuff than when you work for a typical company.<p>Of course, there are various protections that need to be in play to prevent people from scamming it (i.e. quitting the Fund, then launching something next-day with 100% equity) and there would be a need for some kind of audit cycle (to push out people who are coasting) but I think the overall model is superior to anything that exists now.<p>One thought I had is that local governments would have an interest in setting these kinds of things up, because even if the concept fails and they ""lose"" money, it goes back into the city and the network effects also build up the technology ecosystem there.",1366986261

I was living in Boulder, had been reading the Austin hype on HN and then watched the movie Slacker (set in Austin) and a month later I was on a plane to Texas.<p>But I was deceived by craigslist apartment ads. The apartment locators in the city were posting beautiful downtown apartments for ridiculously low rents, it seemed amazing. When I got there I found that occupancy at the mega rental complexes was running over 99% and it was incredibly difficult to find a place to live. I also found that most of those postings were fake. The MO is to post a nice place for low money and when a prospect calls say that one is gone but  they can show you others.<p>I eventually took over a lease from someone at a nice complex right next to the Google office. I had heard Austin was easy to get around without a car, but that wasn't really true. I was an hour ride from downtown on the bus and felt stranded up in NW Austin. The bus stopped running around midnight, and if you missed that the closest bus dropped you off an hour walk from your home on a desolate and dark highway.<p>The buses are ok if you are going north/south, but east/west involves a lot of transfers. I wouldn't want to live in Austin again without a car, as the summers get so hot (100+ for 60 days in a row) you can't show up for a meeting with a client without being a sweaty mess by the time you get there.<p>My rent was raised almost 20% when I renewed my lease, and I am sure the rents are even higher now. I moved to NYC and am only paying $150 more a month to live in great studio in Astoria. It's a little smaller, and I miss the outdoor pool and hot tub I had in Austin but other than that everything else is better here.<p>Austin can definitely be cheap if you buy a single family home, but beware the insane rental market as the city is growing rapidly.",1366986136

Severe sleep deprivation can result in all the psychotic symptoms of florid mania even for most people without a medical history of mood disorders, and it is particularly dangerous for people who have already been through an episode of mania. So as other people here have already commented, regularity of sleep (sleep while it's dark, and get up while it's day) is helpful for mood disorders, up or down, and sleep deprivation by itself will not be a cure-all for all cases of depression.<p>AFTER EDIT: I appreciate HN participant falcolas reminding all of us, in a first reply to this comment, that the submitted article is about an animal model of a proposed drug treatment that may have some of the effects of sleep deprivation without having other effects. Yes, that is what the article is about, and I acknowledged that even after reading the article, the first part of this comment's text (above) had as much to do with other comments here as it had to do with the actual article, maybe more. That said, as investigation of new drug treatments moves from animal models to human clinical trials, the thing to look for in any drug proposed to treat ""depression"" (depressed mood) is whether it might trigger mania (elevated mood) in the patient receiving the treatment. It's tough to develop an animal model of the psychotic symptoms of mania, which is why this is not an easy problem to solve--how to develop a drug that makes depressed patients enjoy normal mood states without breaking through to florid mania.",1366986085

Yes, yes, oil and coal are storing energy from the sun from a billion years ago. But the energy there is already stored. You can't replace that by making a better battery, you need somewhere to get the energy to charge your battery. If you have a cost effective source of energy (wind/nuclear/solar/etc.) to replace them, you can at worst produce carbon-neutral oil synthetically, though alternatives may be more efficient. That doesn't mean storage isn't a problem (efficiency is king there), but it's a different problem -- if we solved the supply problem then regardless of storage we could shut down existing coal and oil fired electrical generating stations. If we only solved the storage problem we would still be burning coal to make electricity.",1366985499

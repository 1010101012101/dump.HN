The number of people who have trouble grasping even what most of us consider <i>very</i> basic concepts like iteration over a list is astonishing.

I usually resorted to doing a manual step-through on a whiteboard or piece of paper, but this is much nicer.<p>I <i>would</i> discourage people from using this constantly, just because I think having a step-through debugger handy constantly will prevent you from developing necessary debugging skills.

The current crisis is a nice example of that.<p>Effectively it is a single giant economy with lots of subtle and not well understood dependencies, wrecking one on purpose will likely wreck the other one as well.<p>Besides that, you are painting all Europeans with the same brush and that is just as stupid as those that like to paint all of the US with one brush.<p>America is not 'the evil empire' (and neither is Europe), but on both sides of the Atlantic there is plenty of stuff going on that does not have the interests of the general public at heart. I don't mind those that expose those things, and I don't mind people trying to avoid making past mistakes again. They're braver than me in many respects.<p>We're moving into uncharted territory with respect to the amount of impact surveillance technology and anti-terrorism measures have on the lives of ordinary citizens. It remains to be seen if the net result of that is beneficial or not (I'm skeptical and I think that it will be a net negative). The United States seems to me to be the party pushing most aggressively to achieve this with the EU following along and sometimes trying to outdo its counterparts.<p>What bugs me is that there is no - or very little - accountability on this front and the extent to which commercial interests and political interests are entwined. It may take a lot of work to undo the damage that we're doing to ourselves and our societies. To polarize that into a US vs Europe debate is silly at best and 'batshit crazy' at worst.

3609441,comment,3609071,3609319,4,0,demallien,,,"It's not as simple as that when you're planning for the long term.  Firstly you need to examine the changes and make sure that they aren't going to create any compatability problems, of the type ""if you activate this option, then you can no longer link to libraries that don't use this option"".  Garbage collection in particular had a lot of those sorts of problems.<p>But even if you can convince yourself that it <i>is</i> just syntactic sugar, you have to have a long hard think about whether or not you are going to adopt the style.  Adopting means going back and changing the code you have already written.  Not adopting the style is not tenable in the long term - the new syntax is clearly superior to the old syntax, so there will be a lot of pressure to code the new way. This is particularly true when playing in Apple's backyard, as they have a habit of taking a nice new technology that is optional in one release, and then building on that optional feature for a next release.<p>For me, in this one particular case, I'll probably go with the new syntax, going back through modules that are already written and redoing them with the new syntax each time I have to touch one for a bug fix/feature.<p>I'm just getting frustrated because my project started about 18 months ago - I work on it nights and weekends, and I have to keep stopping work on the project and spending time adapting to new tools.  The last 18 months or so have been particularly tumultuous.  XCode 4 was a <i>big</i> change compared to its predecessors.  I started using the garbage collector just to have it more or less replaced by ARC.<p>None of this is insurmountable, but as a one person, part-time shop with a fairly ambitious project, this is really starting to become painful for me, which is the point I was trying to get across, and I suspect that I'm not the only one to be feeling the pain.  Perhaps I would feel better about deciding not to follow Apple on this one if I could be sure that that decision wouldn't mean me finding myself with a big code base on my hands that is unable to take advantage of the new hotness in the <i>next</i> version of Objective-C because I decided to skip <i>this</i> version's changes...",1329662664

The left seems fine with this, although they'd never openly admit it, aside from a bunch of pundits complaining, as long as they keep and energize their voter base with their issues.<p>The left seems to generally want to support a class warfare us-versus-the-corporations narrative which seeks to make more and more laws about all companies, 10 employees or a 1000. The right seems fine with this, although they'd never openly admit it, aside from a bunch of pundits complaining, as long as they keep and energize their voter base with their issues.<p>The political debate itself seems to be in a spot where the trick is not to get holding the bag. Do only as much as it takes for voters not to blame you. It's much more crisis-driven than it ever has been.<p>These trends don't look well for conducting international business. I don't think there's any disaster coming, but I think the complex social and political systems we've created will actually become less and less stable the more we try to over-manage them.<p>Right now my money is on ""friendly for business"" but the situation is slowly and inexorably changing for the worse. So if I were a foreigner looking do do a startup, I'd probably be in the states -- and probably would not plan on staying there. (insert long discussion about qualifiers that might change that plan, such as requiring a large, trained workforce or special infrastructure issues.)<p>EDIT: This ""instability in complex systems"" I brought up is exactly illustrated in the JotForms case. The law over-allocates power to an agency, registrars bend over backward to comply with whatever the agency wants (lest they get on the shit list too.), then some pencil-pusher kills several man-years of work. Not out of malice or evilness -- just by simply not being aware of the implications of her actions. The most frustrating thing is that there are no nazis or evil political parties required here. For the most part it's just good, smart, clever, and responsible people all acting as best they can. That's the real tragedy. It's not some kind of comic book, good-guy-versus-bad-guy situation.

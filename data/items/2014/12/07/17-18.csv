The submitted article purported to be about a worldwide phenomenon, and on a worldwide basis, what the Western countries and their democratically elected governments are doing for Internet freedom looks quite good. On a worldwide basis, regarding Internet freedom, the performance of China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, and a lot of other countries and their governments is much worse than that of the Western countries, and yet some participants here who enjoy Western freedom are trying to shut down the broader discussion here by pointing only to the wrongs of Western governments. We know a lot more about what the Western governments are doing than we do about what the other governments are doing precisely because we live in an environment of much more free press in the West than elsewhere. This bias in availability of information shouldn&#x27;t bias all of our discussions of worldwide issues on Hacker News.

The goal is to reach 56M in a few years. After many years where the prices were expensive, we have started to liberalize it and prices have go down. Now it&#x27;s reasonable cheap. You can buy one-way tickets for 30€ for a 1h30 route (like 4h by car). Madrid-Barcelona is one of the most demanding routes and flights can&#x27;t compete with the high speed train. In just a few years, people have moved from using flights to most of them using the train. It&#x27;s way way more comfortable.<p>Of course, the key question is geography.

8712882,comment,8712462,8712700,0,0,jdlegg,,,"I disagree with this assessment.<p>The distance from Chicago to Houston is roughly 1100 miles. Non-stop flights from O&#x27;Hare to Houston Hobby are listed on Kayak.com at 2 hours and 45 minutes. Add approx. 1 hour for pre-flight check-in, security and an average delay factor (it&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare after all). That&#x27;s a 3 hour and 45 minute trip time. We could add post-flight transportation from the airport to where you actually want to be and probably add another hour, but let&#x27;s ignore that detail.<p>In 2007, the French TGV set a speed record on conventional track of 357 mph. The unconventional track (maglev) record belongs to the Japanese SCMaglev and is 368 mph [0]. These were set under very experimental conditions, but if it were possible to realize equivalent speeds in a practical setting (perhaps via underground tunnels), the train trip from Chicago to Houston would require only 3 hours(!).<p>But let&#x27;s assume the above is impossible in real operating conditions. French TGV passenger routes regularly attain speeds of 200mph. This makes our Houston trip a little under 5 1/2 hours. That strikes me as quite efficient.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert, but given the deplorable state of American infrastructure, especially rail, implementation of a system like this would most likely require starting from scratch. As such, equivalence of the French TGV seems very attainable.<p>More likely, new innovation would lead to performance improvements over their system, which was conceived in the 1970s. Is 300mph attainable? I don&#x27;t know, but it seems like a reasonable goal. That brings our Houston trip to roughly the equivalent of a flight, when including pre-flight check-in procedures. Of course, trains are safer, less energy and infrastructure intensive and a lot more pleasant.<p>All of this without mentioning the fact that SCNF, the operator of the French TGV, achieved a $1.75 billion operating profit in 2007.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_speed_record_for_rail_vehicles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_speed_record_for_rail_vehi...</a>",1417973952

After that we got moving and made some decent time but then a freight train had issues ahead of us so we sat somewhere in Colorado for a few hours waiting.  To top it all off, the woman in the sleeper next to us ran out of extra oxygen because she wasn&#x27;t expecting to be at higher elevation that long and without access to more oxygen supplies and so we had to wait for an ambulance to come.<p>We flew back.<p>Some of this was Amtrak&#x27;s fault, some of this was not.

Because free open source is, well, <i>free</i> and <i>open</i> for everything and everyone, and nobody has any obligations to it, and you can never take for granted work somebody does for you for free, ever.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8712035"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8712035</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5106767"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5106767</a>",1417973130

I created a pull request, added a good description of what I had done, and sent it off. The author got back to me pretty quickly with a few changes he wanted done, I happily obliged, and then sat and waited for a week.<p>Then over the following few weeks he proceeded to nitpick and ask for changes that really just amounted to over-engineering for some future possibility he imagined for his 200 line script. I will also point out that beyond the initial commits he had made six months ago, he hadn&#x27;t touched the project since.<p>Regardless, I obliged, made every change he asked for. That was almost a month ago and he has now gone completely silent, the pull request sitting idle.<p>What I learned from the experience is that beyond the points the author made, the balance of power in these projects is often an insurmountable barrier. For instance, if I say something that pisses this guy off, he simply ignores my pull request and it sits in limbo forever. Or I fork his project and other users are forced figure out which version is the best (great example of this is the shitty state of AWS libraries in the Go language).<p>All in all, this experience isn&#x27;t enough to turn me off to contributing to open source projects.

One was expected to learn any required languages completely on one&#x27;s own.<p>I have only taken one CS class in my entire life, Caltech&#x27;s CS 10, which is commonly taken by first year CS majors; I took it my second year.<p>I found it quite puzzling that the CS majors were often stymied by the final project, which required us to write a full-featured GUI vector graphic editor.  That was a tough project but I aced it.  Many of the CS majors would go totally out of their minds trying to get their editors to work, but were unable to.<p>When I entered the workforce after dropping out of school, I was quite concerned that the folks with CS degrees would eat my lunch, so I worked very, very hard to perfect my craft.  However it was not long at all that I found that recent CS grads often knew very little about writing the kind of code that was required of coders in private industry.<p>Consider that an algorithms class would teach all the common ways of sorting - quicksort, mergesort and so on.  One is then expected to write a program that sorts an array of integers using quicksort, a second program that sorts the same array using mergesort, a third that uses insertion sort.<p>None of these programs are very large.  They&#x27;re easy to debug.  You&#x27;re not expected to handle edge cases, like what would happen if someone unplugged the network cable while your program was running.<p>In the kind of code that&#x27;s sold for retail sale, or for eCommerce websites or what have you, you wouldn&#x27;t be expected to implement quicksort, someone else would already have done that so you&#x27;d call a library function like the standard C library&#x27;s qsort().  However what your code WOULD have to do, is handle all that nastiness like unplugged network cables.<p>It&#x27;s not that Computer Science schools could not teach that stuff.  It&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t.<p>Also, it&#x27;s quite uncommon for CS students to collaborate on large projects.  While I do know of it being done, it&#x27;s uncommon.  It would be very helpful, were CS students - at least occasionally - required to collaborate.<p>Finally, many of the technologies which are of crucial importance to private industry, are of very, very little interest to CS professors.  I learned all about what most refer to as &quot;Game Physics&quot; in my upper-division physics studies, but I can&#x27;t imagine a CS instructor wanting to teach her class about how to do, say, ad syndication.",1417971778

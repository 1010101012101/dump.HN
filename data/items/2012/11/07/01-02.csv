That approach is unscientific. It completely ignores data. And the numbers you're fuming about are a trick. The republican proposal is to cut 5 trillion in taxes. How does that help the debt problem. And the debt isn't a problem at all. The entire professional economist community is against you, just like the entire professional climatologist community is against you on climate change.<p>I don't know if you're purposefully being a caricature of republican voters or if you genuinely believe what you're saying, but when you mess with Norvig, you mess with the best. You cannot win against Norvig, he is a tech super-ninja. Those super-ninja skills can equally be applied to deciding who to vote for, and his opinion on this case is signed and sealed.

Firstly he doesn't use his entire bankroll on each trade, secondly he goes long-short consistently over very short periods of time, thirdly he's too tiny to actually move markets, and fourthly he is in and out within a day - where his max var. is 100% on thousands of tiny trades. Think of it like this - he has $100 - he bets $10 of that each day. He can blow that $10 - no problems.<p>Worst case he runs out of capital over a period of weeks.<p>He can't blow up in the way that you think - but he can have large drawdowns over a period of weeks.<p>Markets are eventually consistent scalable systems - and that is why we prefer them over central planning. In the medium term they prices things correctly, cheaply and efficiently (decade+).<p>In the short term however (sub-decade) - they can't price jack.<p>Markets are inefficient period - if they weren't, well then P=NP and you could just put your NP-hard problems into a market and get back cheap, quick, accurate results. Oh - wait - protein folding is actually harder than that.<p>There are 2 major ways to make money in the markets. Value-Growth and statistical arb (often high frequency). The former (Buffett) is highly concentrated bets on the future of business (I'm value - long TSLA/GOOG/Samsung). The latter is looking for thousands of small diversified statistically significant correlations above 50% (random guesses) and trading costs between securities/price movements over short time intervals (aka statistical ghosts in the data - RenTech/Shaw).<p>Both work.

4751821,comment,4751489,4751649,8,0,ekianjo,,,"Nope the article does not focus so much on price. It says 3d printers are getting cheaper and cheaper. But his points are valid: just like it does not make sense to carve your own furniture for everything, it does not make sense to do 3D printing for everything in your house either, because you need different kind of materials for different kind of purpose and no 3d printer is going to be able to reproduce every kind of plastic used around you. Plastic is not just plastic, there are thousands of different polymers used in different industries. Not all of them could be used in a 3D printer setting (some can only be molded under high pressure and high temperature).<p>I may be wrong, but I think you are falling into the typical false technological assumption that a new technology will revolutionize everything just because it becomes available. I mean, look at computers. Even though they are becoming ubiquitous there are not computers in every object we use every day. A lot of our home equipment is still based on ""stupid"" electronics because it's good enough in most cases.<p>3D printers will become more common, more reliable and cheaper as the market develops, but when you can order something on Amazon for 3 dollars and have it delivered at your door in one day, there is a strong competition as to what is the best/most effortless way to get the thing in question. If your goal is to make unique objects that you cannot find anywhere, then, sure, 3d printers are the future, but most of us are living in environments where many things have been standardized, and products fitting these standards are readily available.",1352253435

My initial reaction to it is that I don't have a day-to-day need to manufacture stuff, because when I moved into my first solo apartment, I gradually bought the stuff I wanted to have (thinking things like furniture, various electronics, dishes, storage, etc.). I occasionally add or replace something, but that's something that happens at the scale of once or twice per month at most. I certainly don't need a machine sitting around that I have to buy and maintain and supply to fulfill this need.<p>With computers, there are a lot of day-to-day tasks that become much easier. For example, before computer, everyone had to balance their checkbooks in order to know how much money they had. Now you can just log into your bank website or mint.com. People used to correspond by phone and physical letter to keep in touch with relatives (also on a daily or at least weekly basis), and now that's much easier.<p>It's hard to say though.

There is already an entire set of industries built to produce widgets.  3D printing doesn't offer any benefit except for customized items.  So how often do you need something customized?  No matter how cheap 3D printers are, it's always going to be cheaper to get somebody else to print a one-off for you using their machine.  You don't use it all day multiple times a day.

Even worst:  You don't seem to be willing to (or capable of?) distilling through data on your own and have to resort to being supported by others.<p>If you even took a few minutes to play with the numbers you'd be horrified to realize where we are and, more importantly, where we are going.<p>Creating an economic model with a spreadsheet is a really scary and sobering exercise.  I've done a couple.  The aim was to see what needed to change in order to achieve what most would recognize as solid economic recovery over a period of time.  I played with periods in the range of 25 to 50 years.  And, while the numbers can never be 100% accurate, the reality painted by the model is nothing less than scary.  Even if my numbers where 100%, nah, 200%, off the reality they paint is horrible.<p>No, you can't fix it by taxing the rich.  Not even close.  You can't even fix it by taxing everyone.  You just can't.  You have to cut spending with a vengeance and, yes, adjust taxes --for everyone-- slightly.  Let's not get facts get in the way of a good bullshit discussion.<p>Do a model, discuss it with a few people and then go read the likes of Peter Norvig and see what you think of them.<p>Here's my answer to Norvig's ""Why do you support Obama?"" segment on the page you linked:<p>""End of war in Iraq"".  Who the hell cares.  The war is a rounding error compared to what we've been doing to this country under Obama.  What? Five, maybe six trillion dollars in additional debt?  Please.<p>""Focus on al Qaeda and Taliban""  Who the fuck cares?  What happened in Libya demonstrates full-well that terrorism wasn't challenged in any way by getting this guy.  Old history.<p>""Universal Health Care"" Disaster.  Talk to a few business people to get real data.  They are scared to death.  If Obamacare is so good, why did he have to grant exceptions en-masse to unions?<p>""Increase US Manufacturing""  I used to own a manufacturing business.  I saw, first hand, what was going on and have the scars to prove it.  The economic dump was so deep that some kind of a pull-back was inevitable.  I love it when people take credit for things they had nothing to do with.  I use to do a lot of day-trading.  There were days when stocks would over sell to such a degree that you absolutely KNEW --if you were conscious enough to remove yourself from the fray-- that they were going to come back up.  Some of the easiest money I ever made, both on the long and short side.<p>""Save Detroit""  Detroit has been an ugly mess for decades.  The coddling of the unions made us less competitive and allowed abominations to creep into contracts.  GM had, at one point, thousands workers actually reporting to work and getting paid a full salary to do absolutely nothing.  Detroit needed a good hard reset.  They didn't get it.  We'll see where the story ends.  I don't see any option for a happy ending because the culture and rules are the same, thanks to Obama.  He needed those people to vote for him in future elections and swiftly bought their votes via the rescue plan.  I wonder, how would Norvig feel if the Federal Government threw billions of dollars at a failing competitor.  Ford did not need any money.  The government artificially altered the market.  And this is good?<p>""Bring back jobs"" Government can only create government jobs.  Obama did not create a single private sector job.  The private sector created these jobs.  Again, I refer you to my explanation when a market is over-sold.<p>""Cut taxes on middle class""  Really, we are diluted and stupid enough to be happy with an extra $400 a year in our pockets?  Wait, then they take it back out through other taxes.  I get it if you want to believe in His Excellence Obama no-matter-what, but this is silly.<p>""Support green energy"" I am still waiting to get a number from someone, anyone, on how many of the over five million jobs his holiness created were ""green energy"" jobs.  Crickets.  And Norvig is quoting a comedian for his facts?  Whew!<p>""Avoid another banking crisis""  So, our politicians create the mess that causes the economic downturn by allowing, no, demanding, that Freddie Mac, etc. create an environment where a McDonalds cook can buy a $750,000 home.  And then we praise them for avoiding a banking crisis?  Are we insane?<p>""Monitor and contain loose nuclear material"" OK, I'll give him that one.  Only because I have no way to refute any of it.  I am tempted to say ""who cares, any president would have continued to move in that direction"", but I just don't know enough.<p>There's more, but I'm done.  Thankfully the election will be over today.  I hope I don't have to live with your decision.  What's worst, I hope my kids don't have to live with your decision.  I'll accept it if it happens to go that way, but it will be sad to see.  We can compare notes in four years.<p>Peace.<p>Do the numbers.<p>Think.",1352251159

Hopefully you can put them to good use, or at least understand what some old fuddy-duddys that aren't impressed by ""the cloud"" and ""social"" think.  Or have a beer and laugh at the old guy saying ""get off my lawn"" - I'm OK with that too.<p>When you make claims like ""the worlds most sophisticated layout tool"" you're making impossible claims.  I've yet to see anything that your tool does that Protel (now Altium) and others weren't doing a decade ago.<p>I understand different markets, but at $299 / user / month for your ""professional"" offering, you're not too far off of Altium Designer's cost.  You're roughly double Eagle's price, and yours is a subscription service, rather than a pay once and done.<p>It appears you also have to pay separately for simulation - another cost that Altium and Eagle do not have.<p>You make pricing hard to find on your website.  I'm looking for pricing, not a ""try upverter now"" button - to me that says ""get the demo"", not ""pricing"".  Your package names look like something designed picked by someone just out of college and trying overly hard to be hip, not something meant to convey any meaning.  ""Open Source"" ""Awesome"" and ""Professional"" - really?  Why not just ""Free"" ""Personal"" and ""Professional""?  Conveys what you get with each package much quicker and more clearly.  You have very little about what's included with each package.  For instance, what's a ""Team+User"" account type vs a ""User"".  How much simulation time is included with each package, since you make a reference to paying for only what you use?  What's the cost of additional simulation time?<p>From your ""Professional"" registration page:  ""Welcome, Professional.  This is going to be awesome!""  Really?  Awesome?  I thought ""Awesome"" was your middle-tier package.  It creates confusion and impressions you may not want.<p>Too much emphasis on buzzwords.  Do you really need to use ""cloud"" that often?  How about ""Awesome!""?<p>Your ""Terms of Use"" basically say you're not responsible for the security of anything.  Not something you want when you're trying to entice people into doing creative work with your service.  You say you can end the service whenever you want with the only notification being via the webpage - Not something to make businesses shell out $3588 / year.  Likewise, you say you're able to revoke access entirely or in part without notification, and that the website may be unavailable at times, and that you may, at your discretion, delete a user's uploaded data.<p>From a business standpoint, these terms are completely unacceptable - would you pay $3588 / year with no guarantee that you'd be able to use the service, or that you'd be able to access your data?<p>As a hobbyist, are you willing to have all your work and data disappear on a third party's whim?<p>From a business customer standpoint, I'd rather pay the extra to Altium, sink the cost of the software, pay half your yearly cost for Altium's subscription, and keep my propitiatory data in-house, instead of trusting an unknown 3rd party's claims to privacy, security, and longevity.  Knowing where Protel was a decade ago - I'll also say that their software does a lot more than yours, again putting your claims at being the ""most sophisticated"" in question.<p>From a hobbyist standpoint, I'm still not comfortable putting things that are as tedious to reproduce as schematics and board layouts under the control of a third party.  Eagle ""Standard"" is $169 (individual hobbyist use), and the copy will be good as long as I have a computer that will run it.  That cost just over two years of paying for your ""Awesome"" package.  Eagle ""Light"" is $69, less than one year of your ""Awesome"" package, and I again have something that lasts as long as I maintain a computer that can run it.  I can buy a new ""Light"" package every year and still save money over your service.",1352250667

This partly explains why some Republicans on the West coast could be considered ""too liberal"" to win in the Midwest, while some Southern Democrats from the last decade formerly endorsed segregation.<p>And the parties encompass so many issues, it's nearly impossible for anyone to be a partisan down the line while remaining consistent. Isolationists and libertarians will clash in the Republican's tent, while union supporters and environmentalists might clash in the Democrat's tent.<p>Parties aren't awesome, they often get distracted by short term tactical goals that hurt the country rather than pursuing long term strategies to refine public policy. But I think that's a vision and leadership problem, not a problem with parties themselves. The wide range of views within each party should at least provide some reassurance that the parties aren't always just giant soul-crushing machines.<p>Just sometimes.",1352250346

It's not like email where I can go on and connect with someone. It doesn't give me something that I didn't have before. I can't print the expensive things in my life, I can print stupid things like cups, cases, boxes, clips, holders, etc. Light things, cheap things. I can customize them, that is the huge thing 3D printing allows - customization. Short of that, it doesn't have any of the fancy flashery that electronics do.<p>This isn't to say that it won't happen, but it needs a new spin. It needs the 'killer app' that makes people want it. 1 Kg of ABS plastic (1.75 mm in diameter) is ~$30. PLA is more expensive, but it is renewable (~$45 / kg). It's not free to make stuff once you have one (it will last for a while, but you'll still need raw material).<p>They are slow, at least for 1D printers (filament printers are parametric printers, we move our nozzle in a line that gets longer with time). SLA printers are faster, way faster. They print planes at a time. They also can have better resolution. The trouble with them is that the liquid material is significantly more expensive as they are UV cured (so they need special handling, and whatnot).<p>I've been trying to think of something cool for what could be done with the situation (as it would get me a lot of money), but it's a hard problem. We're spoiled by how luxurious electronics are, how precise they are, and how little we have to think about how well they work. Little electro-mechanical things would be cool, and I could probably hand out a lot of personalized presents, but do I really need one in my house? Yes. Do my parents need one in their house? No.",1352250006

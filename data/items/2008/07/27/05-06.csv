258059,comment,258000,258014,0,0,jmtame,,,"I don't know of any startups that outsource their development.  I know of startups that pull in the assistance from other studios or extremely talented contractors nearby, although the last startup I was in, we did that early on (seed funding stage) and the studio that worked for us did a terrible job.  It was a nightmare and in the end, I was sent in to fix all of their problems in Flash.  It was a combination of incompetence on behalf of the studio, and they weren't physically present, so the pressure on them for succeeding wasn't as strong as if they were in the same room as us.<p>What happens if you outsource?  You'll either save on two things: time and money.  If you save on time, you're going to pay a high price for good quality.  If you skip out on price, you're going to get crappy code, and you will spend just as much time explaining to the developers how to build your product.  And I know of startups at my school that have re-written their entire code base simply because of how rapidly they're iterating.  Can you imagine what it'll be like trying to get a company from another country to write your initial code base, and then eventually hiring someone to manage it?  I'm guessing it will be a nightmare.  There's a reason why companies like Google and Facebook are desperate for top engineers, it's because the quality becomes a competitive advantage, it's pretty important in a startup and investors know this.  That's why so much emphasis is on your team, and not necessarily your idea.<p>Why not stick it out for a month and write your own prototype?  It will take the same amount of time to find, hire, explain, review, and finalize code being done by someone else.<p>I want to say that any ambitious angel investor or VC will NOT fund you if you outsource your development.  Why would they?  You aren't bringing much to the table at that point.  And if your only advantage is some code that was written, well I'm sure your angel or VC already has several programmers in their rolodex that could do the same thing, with better code, much faster.  So you'll have a very hard time convincing someone why they should invest in you, instead of just pass the idea off to one of their existing startups to work on if their current gig is failing.<p>I don't want to discourage you from pursuing your idea.  Just keep all of this in mind when you make your decision.",1217137959

Why? It wasn't good enough. If you're going go use it, make sure the framework you build isn't decent but excellent, and I'm only saying this because there are people who have written great frameworks before. The problem is that you might get caught up in your own ""but I built this so it must kick ass"" like I kind of did. Doing so is like using a software package from a sketchy vendor (no offense) and you wouldn't do that, would you?",1217136989
258056,comment,257958,257958,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"If you're doing web development for money, then you should go with whatever is the most expedient solution that produces reasonably attractive results.  The danger here of course is that in the long run what's expedient now may lead to problems down the road - such as when you hit a problem the pre-built solution can't handle, or if it causes you to do more work than you would if you only had a better understanding of the underlying technology.<p>With that said, if you're doing this to try and learn something, then you will be doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least try to roll your own version of everything you will want to do with the web.  Even if you start out with your own stuff and decide to swap in freely available components (open source, etc.), at least then you'll understand the infrastructure you're working with at a level you would otherwise not.",1217136672
258055,comment,257391,257523,0,0,drewp,,,"The proof of Proebsting's Law seems kind of silly because running a compiler with optimizations turned off wouldn't actually disable all the years of advancements of compiler technology. It seems quite reasonable that many compiler advancements have to be added at the same time as hardware support. That doesn't make them purely hardware contributions.<p>Also, the proof skips more than a few critical steps when it says ""Let's assume that this ratio is about 4X"" and then uses that number as a multiplier in the answer.",1217136619
258054,comment,257917,257917,0,0,dhbradshaw,,,"I'd like a new model for academic publishing.  Normally, two of the most important roles of a publisher are quality control (hopefully), and marketing.  In academics, mechanisms are probably already in place to take care of both of these functions.  In any case, distribution should no longer be an important part of the services a publisher provides.  For academic publishing, then, the most important function of a publisher may be to provide the actual physical form of the book.<p>This is the new model: let the authors compete on the quality of their content, and let the publishers compete on the physical quality and price of the books they publish.  Let the authors keep the rights to the books, but let them then allow many different publishers to compete with different form factors and prices for the books.  Maybe then we would get much lower prices for higher quality physical books.",1217136610

No way the NY Times just goes through TPB looking for the most piquant torrent and write a tilted article about it.  Seriously....revenge?<p>College students are frugal people. Between work and school it's not easy making a living to put food in your belly and pay the costs of student housing month after month.  They want to save money, books cost astronomically more to purchase than they do to produce, and this columnist reduces all of this down to ""revenge""?<p>I've got to admit, this is one tilted article if I've ever read one; quotes from publishing companies, none from TPB who if this writer had done PROPER research instead of stating oversimplifications would have seen are happy to talk with the press rather candidly about their operations.<p>No quotes from students, no quotes from TPB directly about the issues, and Randall Stross has the capacity to call this whole thing ""revenge""?

258044,comment,253682,254562,0,0,dhbradshaw,,,"Thanks for replying to my comment.  I was a bit surprised that no one did for a little while.<p>Although I said ""weakness in logic,"" I didn't mean to say that logic is weak or flawed.  I really meant that it is insufficient to use logic in the absence of shared assumptions.  As you point out, sharing of assumptions can come through communicated and shared experiences.<p>I think that your description of how learning comes about in science is a powerful one.  I believe that some aspects of it should apply to religion.<p>In my particular religion, the process of gaining faith, and then of moving from faith to knowledge is framed almost as a science experiment.  You apply particular principles and see what the outcomes are.  As you see the outcomes your faith grows.  (See Alma 32:26-36 in the Book of Mormon--available online through LDS.org.)  Faith is a word for something less than knowledge that becomes knowledge only through experience.  You might look at it from a Bayesian perspective and say that with more data uncertainty grows smaller.<p>""How do I render a religious experience for myself?""  This question strikes me as a little bit odd, and that may be because of a weakness in the metaphor between science and religion.  Science studies things.  Religion studies the Divine.  What I mean is that religious experience may be more of a conversation than a solitary experience.  Conversations happen by mutual agreement.  However, it is still a good question because it shows progress from worrying about a tool that processes information to worrying about how to seek new information.<p>Here is a simple religious experiment: pray to God and ask if He can hear you.  Document your frame of mind when you prayed.  Did you actually want an answer?  Were you willing to accept the possibility of no answer?  Document any answer or lack of answer you experience.<p>In science, we generally come to knowledge only slowly, over time--although sometimes things progress more quickly than other times.  It is the same in religion.  The most likely answer to such a prayer is a gradual one, something spoken quietly to the heart.  Such an answer is partial, at best.  Maybe you manufactured it mentally.  Maybe you didn't even hear anything.  It was so quiet.  Was anything really there?   But something was there.  At least enough to follow up on.  And you move forward from there, performing experiments, seeking answers, asking questions and listening and acting.  Just like a signal, over time, can appear out of noise, so religious truth, over time, arises out of uncertainty.  You talk with others and compare notes.  But in the end, for something this important, you really want to know for yourself.  You have to perform the experiments, you have to have the experiences, you have to gain the knowledge for yourself.  Besides, it's not like physics.  With religion, everybody seems to be saying different things than everybody else.  So it becomes up to you.<p>LDS missionaries seek to guide one person at a time through experiences that lead to enough personal knowledge of the gospel to warrant baptism.  As far as I know, this is the only way that they can be effective.",1217135296
258043,comment,258028,258028,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I'm actually sort-of impressed by the wide variety of different types of ""extremism"" that article identified. Normally, it's just ""a few hillbillies wearing wifebeaters, nothing to see here, move along...""<p>As usual, however, the point is missed entirely.<p>There are people out there who genuinely hate human sub-groups because of membership differences. Such people are rightly marginalized--literal hatred is an ignoble, dangerous quality. But the vast, vast bulk of what is described as ""hate"" is simply ordinary human inclinations that happen to deviate from the beliefs of international elitists.<p>Take Tibet. The Tibetan movement (which I <i>don't</i> follow closely, so correct me if I'm wrong) is essentially a nationalist movement. Do we call it a ""nationalist"" movement? Not usually. Liberals are collectively enamored of Tibet, for some reason. If the good people of South Carolina try to secede from the union, that's a tremendous sin...and blood will have to flow. Yet...it's the same impulse. People who are just trying to govern themselves, rather than <i>be</i> governed. That's the heart of nationalism.<p>When the Chinese government moves to keep their country in one piece <i>THAT</i> is called nationalism. Okay, whatever. It's actually imperialism, but...whatever. Any lie will do, if it works.",1217135225

That's what I would've done.<p>The only thing I can think of is that the article's author doesn't want to have to move between the parentheses.  His initial complaint was that adding a function 'fab' in between foo and bar means you have to rename everything.  If you chain the functions in one long expression, you need to navigate to between bar and foo, type 'fab(', then add a separate parentheses onto the end.<p>It also gets really ugly when foo, bar, and baz are instead line-long expressions, which they often are:<p><pre><code>    X1 = big_long_expression_containing_some_stuff_and_baz(\n              big_long_expression_containing_some_stuffand_bar(\n                     big_long_expression_containing_some_stuff_and_foo(X))).\n</code></pre>\nWhile if you have a sane linebreaking policy (as both Haskell and Eve do), you can do:<p><pre><code>   X = big_long_expression_containing_some_stuff_and_baz\n     . big_long_expression_containing_some_stuff_and_bar\n     . big_long_expression_containing_some_stuff_and_foo\n     $ x</code></pre>",1217135070

The fact that a web based list is always up to date, and the idea that it is publicly readable.

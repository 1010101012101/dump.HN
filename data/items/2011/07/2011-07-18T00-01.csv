2774695,comment,2774254,2774254,29,0,bluehat,,,"A housemate of mine had a very creative solution: as a teacher he said that he would give anybody who cheated a 0 and that appeals could be filed with the Dean's office to prove they did not cheat.  Most importantly, nobody would be told if they had been caught cheating, the zero would just show up on their grades.<p>The system plays on the student's mind: when they submit the first assignment and cheat their motivation to bother to make the minimal effort to dick around with the next one waivers. Most of the cheaters apparently dropped before the midterms.  Any whiners with the balls to claim they had not cheated get to make their case to the Dean and voluntarily submit themselves to the school judicial process, but this was generally unneeded as apparently most cheaters dropped the class before midterms.  No whiners in your office, and the reviews of you as a teacher are in before you fail them.  Seems like it addresses all your problems.",1310950612

When people have an attitude that says ""forgiveness is required"", this can have a lasting and widespread influence.  Nations with a strong history in such teachings, even if they are not particularly religious now, may retain that attitude toward forgiveness.<p>[0] A friend of mine wrote, after his sister was murdered, that he had no option but to forgive, that regardless of his emotions, his theology required it.   <a href=""http://darrow.faithweb.com/murder.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darrow.faithweb.com/murder.htm</a>",1310950373

The remaining 5% are considered fair game by the students.<p>Most tests (as in over 90%) do not allow you to use books or any other material; sometimes students would try to hide notes or get an answer from a fellow student but ultimately with the teacher watching and the situation in the class room being really quiet, in most cases there is hardly anything you can really do or find out anyway but maybe you can get one or two hints tops.<p>Also, most exams (at least where I studied) did not have multiple choice tests instead you would have to write a proper answer and apply knowledge.

2774581,comment,2774254,2774531,6,0,wisty,,,"A math majors can just copy the homework. 90% of it is mechanical, and 10% requires a ""twist"". You can copy the ""twist"", and the rest is easy. Or copy it all (in a slightly different format), and just claim that it's the same because it's ... well, the same. Unless you both make a mistake. But it's even easier than copying essays.<p>Still, the exam will be a problem. But if lots of students cheat, the lecturers will start making exams easier, because so many students struggle. And in Australia, there's a big belief amongst the education policy mandarins that exams are useless because they don't teach anything.<p>Still, most Math majors know their degree is useless if they don't learn anything, and they chose a brutally hard course with no set career path just to learn, so why bother cheating? But Engineering majors is another story.",1310947519

Usually you wear a lot of hats when you start. However, I've worked as a project manager and later, as a CEO. I can definitely agree with you that your job runs more akin to being a ""captain"" of the boat, rather than a dictator who pulls all the lines and sets all the sails by him/herself.<p>Also, any good product manager (or designer, or creative, etc) will do quality work orders of magnitude beyond your own capacities - your job as CEO when working with other collaborators is to choose the right people to get on the bus with you, and make sure they have the right mix of order, incentives and other elements necessary to be successful. You could help determine some comon goal, but usually the execution changes greatly from what you originally expected as your collaborators bring their own skills and interests to the table. It's a beautiful (and hard!) process, really.<p>CEOs or leaders who fail to control costs, pricing, sales, promotions, etc and instead focus all their energies on product, usually will ruin their businesses in the medium to long run. A CEO makes sure all of those bases are covered, while a product manager does not.",1310947214

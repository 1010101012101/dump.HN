The fact that many older people aren&#x27;t in positions where&#x27;s comfortable or easy to do doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not needed.<p>One could also make the argument that many &#x27;older&#x27; people also tend have have more disposable income and savings to bootstrap their own ideas, have larger networks of people reach out to for connections, etc, and often may have many of their life stuff behind them (kids, house, etc).  Therefore there&#x27;s many older people who are in a better position to be risky than a young person.  The &#x27;risk&#x27; factor is all relative, of course, with people at different stages of life.",1393261194

However, grad students are underpaid, overworked indentured servants in a vicious dictatorial status hierarchy (do what the PI says or you&#x27;re out). Very poor career prospects, guaranteed negative return on time invested. The road to PI is sure to destroy your love of research.<p>2) Industry - Decent pay but work is extremely mundane. Very few &quot;unicorn&quot; positions which allow freedom for creative roles. No control of hours. Promotion becomes a very serious game of office politics, which can get very nasty.<p>3) Professions (Law, Med) - Enter at your own risk. Savagely competitive and draconian entrance requirements, incredibly expensive education, inhuman hours, constant stress at every milestone, and a never-ending barrage of standardized tests. However, if you endure, you can start your own practice and potentially have a comfortable life.<p>4) Entrepreneur - By far the riskiest option. Due to the get rich quick mantra of current investors, social/web/photo apps are the name of the game. Have an idea for a radical new research project with a long term focus? Forget about it. Build and flip is the only game in town. Build an app, get acquired or go go public, make your billions and get out. If it fails, try again, and again, and again....<p>So, now that we have looked at our options, can we really blame someone for going to work at a hedge fund? I can&#x27;t. Especially if one is burdened with massive student debt.  Ironically, hedge funds and investment banks pay employees much more fairly than any other industry, due to their profit sharing systems (bonuses). Meanwhile, tech industry execs are screaming over how high (!!) engineer salaries are, and are going across the globe to find H1-Bs and changing legislation to push those salaries back down.<p>If we want everyone to work on world changing projects, we have to set proper incentives. That requires a radically different setup than we have now.<p>TL;DR: Go to the hedge funds young man. Don&#x27;t look back. Nothing else makes sense.",1393260997

Why,  because they had to respond to Google who did exactly the same thing that Microsoft was lambasted for doing with IE: pushing proprietary, unsafe technology before it became standardized and forcing other browsers to catch up.

Not only is WebGL inherently flawed, but Google — one of WebGL’s strongest proponents — even knew about the DoS and cross-domain image vulnerabilities months before they were thrust into the limelight by Context’s report.

First, consider why we use HTTPS (in an overly-simplistic view):<p>1. Integrity<p>You want to make sure the data you&#x27;re getting is from the source you expect, and that it hasn&#x27;t been compromised. HTTPS does this with PKI by enabling you to verify the destination host is really who they say they are (Certificates) and to only trade data with them. Anybody who doesn&#x27;t pass the signed-certificate-verifying test, doesn&#x27;t get to give us data.<p>2. Secrecy<p>We don&#x27;t want anyone else knowing what our data is because it may contain sensitive information. Once we verify the identity of the sender, each session is independently encrypted to prevent later decoding.<p>So what would we need to cache our content and retain its integrity and secrecy? The simplest thing would be encrypted blobs of data signed by our destination host&#x27;s certificate. A proxy could keep data for a set amount of time, perhaps each piece of data encapsulated in a different session. All our client would need to do was connect once and initiate a session, and the server could deliver a copy of the encrypted/signed payload to the proxy.<p>With some magic flags in the new protocol our client could be instructed that the server allows the client to make a &#x27;proxy request&#x27; to the destination for content. This request could be made in such a way that it allows a proxy to intercept this request from the client (which could be plaintext actually), get the encrypted chunk from the destination (which could also be done plaintext), and the proxy could deliver the chunk to the client, similar to what it does now with HTTP. Since the chunk was signed and encrypted by the destination, the proxy can&#x27;t do anything but deliver the exact copy the destination gave it. Our client receives the data it wants from the proxy and verifies it&#x27;s from the destination, unpacks it and loads it.<p><pre><code>  1. Client requests content from server (HTTPS)\n  2. Server replies back that server allows proxy requests (HTTPS)\n  3. Client sends request again with proxy-request flags and arbitrary content identifier & session identifier (HTTP)\n  4. Proxy receives request, gets content from server (HTTP)\n  5. Proxy replies to client delivering content from server (HTTP)\n  6. Client verifies content was signed by server\n</code></pre>\nOf course this would be limited in its usefulness compared to plaintext caching; it would be user and session specific, so only lots of requests by the same client in a session would benefit from this. But it would theoretically save on bulk requests of encrypted content while preserving integrity and secrecy.",1393260144

You can ask what would happen if you perturb the system: &quot;What if I do <something often interpreted as upsetting the chain of command>?&quot;<p>If you know the industry, or can speak with a friend in it, that&#x27;s good. Then you can predict much of what they do/think, and watch out for irrational/ignorant deviations.<p>Will they give you contact info of a normal employee, or leave you alone to speak with them? If they&#x27;re really good, they&#x27;ll do it without you needing to ask.<p>Bosses are professional liars. (This includes technically true statements designed to mislead. Whether they&#x27;re even aware of it is not relevant.) Conditioned daily to say what maximizes their interests, or they fail.

I had some problem where a Data.Text was being passed into a function where Data.Text.Lazy was expected (Network.Mail.Mime.simpleMail for the record). The error message was deep in the internals of Data.Text.Lazy rather than in my code.

I didn&#x27;t feel like the compiler helped me at all.<p>Stepping through a program linearly doesn&#x27;t seem possible (though not entirely sure why not) so I have no intermediate or step through capability.

You still wanna job here?&quot;<p>2. some will not hire you just for asking because they prefer employees who can take the risk<p>To find out what their true health is, ask them:<p>1. How many paying customers did you have last year?<p>2. How many paying customers did you add this year?<p>3. How many paying customers canceled, or what&#x27;s your cancellation rate?<p>A good answer indicates healthy year-over-year growth with a low cancellation rate that speaks to good customer retention and customer satisfaction. Especially in a subscription business retaining customers is critical.<p>If the company has less than 20 people are the answer is &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; or &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; or &quot;We weren&#x27;t in business last year&quot; or &quot;We don&#x27;t charge any customers yet.&quot; then it&#x27;s has approx 50:50 odds of surviving another year.",1393257701

No. Possible? I have no clue, but I&#x27;d rather not gamble on it.",1393257606

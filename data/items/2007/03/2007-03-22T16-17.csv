I don't know that I'm really convinced that we suffer from the first--in fact, I consider being vertical as a virtue and don't believe we've crossed the line (although we could), and re: not enough money--well, we're working on it. :-)<p>I'm not convinced that living in the Bay Area (or a similar hotbed) is essential.  However, I do agree with what I believe is the underlying premise--that living in an area of concentrated geekdom will expose you to other geeks in a good way.  But that can occur in college, or at a great company, and many of those exist outside of the Bay Area, albeit with much less frequency . . . but to say that you couldn't find a great hacker in Chicago or New York or Houston if you hung out at the right schools and businesses is a little strong.  Then again, if it's a numbers game, then by all means go to San Fran.  But in some sense it reminds me of how many people hang out in Palm Beach hoping to fall in love with someone that just happens to be a millionaire.  My suspicion is that geek cliques do form, and they often form in college.  That to me is the bigger point than saying 'if you want to start a startup, you should put a flower in your hair and . . .'.

And if you think you'll have nothing done by the end of three months (but will still have talent and ideas), you also don't get funded.<p>And if you're able to create something of great value after three months but you'll still have lots of value left to add, then just unask the question because the answer is irrelevant.

5715,comment,5572,5590,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Cal addresses that by arranging his book in roughly the order that you should think about things.  He recommends that you think about:<p>1. Version control<p>2. Issue tracking<p>3. One-click deploy<p>4. Internationalization<p>5. Security<p>before you start building your application, then you build and release it, then (and only then) start thinking about:<p>6. Email<p>7. Web services<p>8. Scalability<p>9. Statistics & monitoring<p>10. APIs<p>This mostly squares with my experiences (both with my own startup - currently on step 3, with 4, 5 and a launch-ready app already done - and working for others).  The only changes I'd make are:<p>1. Move statistics and monitoring up the priority list, before launch.  You want that data available to drive feature implementation.<p>2. I'm of two minds on internationalization.  I think that most apps can wait until they're popular before they need to internationalize.  However, i18n is really difficult to do later, after you've already built an app.  I watched LiveJournal go through the process, and it wasn't pretty.  So even though you don't need it, you may want to do it upfront because it'll be much harder later.",1174582020

5713,comment,5529,5624,0,0,jamongkad,,,"I think you're onto something here. What I truly believe is to make something customers want. A sin that I fall in at times is making something customers don't want and by and large letting supply get ahead of demand. Another thing I believe is that if your product is going to do something then it might as well make life easier for the regular Joe instead of the computer nerd. Why? well in my opinion the regular Joe is more likely to belong to a larger market segment.",1174581777
5712,comment,5700,5708,0,0,jadams,,,"Er. I recommend not immediately pissing away $200K, but that's just me. If you're in your early 20's, a $200K investment could easily be  $1M by your thirties.<p>Taking a $1M lump-sum means never having to work again. That's not to say you won't work again, or won't be productive again. But I'd feel really stupid if at some later date I <i>had</i> to take a job, just because I pissed away my capital.",1174581504

That's why it doesn't fit the pattern.<p>We could make a whole separate list of schemas for creating good products too.

5710,comment,4304,4737,0,0,jadams,,,"You're using the word ""incorporate"" incorrectly, which was my original point. To incorporate means to start a corporation. Therefore, registering a sole-proprietorship is, by definition, not incorporation. <p>The more general term is ""register"", which applies to the three forms of business: sole-proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations.<p>What you're thinking of is a business name registration. If you do business as your exact name, you don't need to register a name. If you make more than, $30k (I think), then you <i>do</i> need to register for a GST number.",1174580968

5708,comment,5700,5701,0,0,sethjohn,,,"A good way to start might be the rule of thumb that startup investors typically want a 10x return on their money (for companies that succeed). If YC invests $20K in your company in return for 6% of the company, and the company sells for 3.3 million, they get 200K.<p>Our three founders came up with a number in our own heads, then we agreed on something in the middle...which turned out to be pretty close to 3 million.<p>As to the question of whether to sell so soon, my personal feeling is that selling soon in a case like this would be a fantastic deal. Each founder would walk away with $1M, and the experience of being a successful entrepeneur. Next, take 100K and throw a tremendous party, take another 100K on go on a ridiculous vacation...then get back to work with the $800K you have left over and start up your next company!",1174580350

5706,comment,5572,5574,0,0,bhb,,,"""The Long Tail"" is definitely worth reading, although I sort of felt it was a topic that only deserved a long essay expanded into an entire book. Then again, I felt the same way about ""The Tipping Point"" - interesting idea and points, but it probably could have made just as big an impact in a book half the size.",1174579869
5705,comment,5487,5601,0,0,notabel,,,"I agree with you; Tumblr seems to fill a niche somewhere between a public del.icio.us feed and a blog.  It lets you show people things in a genuinely unified manner (unlike del.icio.us, which is links, only links, nothing but links), without obligating you to go into commentary.  It's kind of like a multicast, pull version of emailing something nifty to a friend.  I think there's definitely a market for that.",1174579660

Obviously, it's not possible to produce a number with any real meaning; just discuss potentialities, grand strategy, basically the conceptual framework you'd use for producing that number.<p>NB: As usual, this is me, guessing.

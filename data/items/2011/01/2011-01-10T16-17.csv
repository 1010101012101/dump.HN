It's chancy, fickle, and composed of so many moving parts that any one is basically meaningless in the context of the real world. By studying what successful ventures have in common (persistence, for instance), people miss the invaluable lessons contained in the far more common experience of failure.

On long distance links, my guess is that the propagation delays might dominate latencies.<p>I disagree with the point that a solution to bufferbloat is purely end-to-end, if that's what the author implied (Apologies if the author didn't mean this).

""How much buffering do we need in a network?""  ""What if I run a network with as small a buffer as possible?""  There are some people who believe that there should just be O(1) buffering in the network.  It has been theoretically and experimentally shown that TCP loses only 30% of the throughput if the bottleneck link in the network has a buffer size of just ONE PACKET!  So the question here is:  is 30% thput loss acceptable?  If latency matters, then perhaps yes.",1294677283

2088805,comment,2088718,2088718,0,0,kleinsch,,,"I have my doubts. One main criticism of Groupon and other daily deal companies is that their business is much less defensible. Aside from the size of their email lists, there's no reason a small business shouldn't go run their daily deal on another competing site. In that case, it comes down to how many users Groupon can get the deal in front of. With their daily email, they can get one page view per day per user. Google gets 10-1000 page views per day per user because of their search and display business, and has one of the largest reaches of any Internet company.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Groupon is going to fail. I think they're going to be worth a bunch of money in a year or two. I just think they're going to get a much lesser share of the daily deal market than Google has of search/search-advertising. Right now they have a huge percentage, but I think that's going to fall and stunt their growth.",1294675444

Or want to move there with us?",,"My cofounder and I are looking to move within the next week or so to Mountain View (or nearby) to build/launch our startup. We may be open to other areas as well. I was just curious to see if anyone either had some extra rooms that they were looking to rent or if anyone was interested in moving with us and looking into getting a larger space. Both of us are fairly neat, relaxed, and value quiet, and we're mainly just looking for a place to stay on a month to month (or 6 month lease) basis. If you'd like to know more or have a place already please send me an email (in profile).  Thanks!",1294675296

It might seem strange to some but this is a solid image to see when you're camping - there are machine cycles going on that is keeping your data alive and you have no control over those machines, and you don't have your own data.<p>Which is crazy to me, and i would never let that happen.

I have just written a hello-world application in Tapestry. And I have no experience in developing using tapestry. My understanding from tapestry 5.2 docs is
1. Tapestry retains the state of the pages and components. (you need to annotate your state variables though). So,  I am surprised that you need to reinitialize the field every time.
2. Tapestry provides parameter blocks to pass parameters to a component. It looks similar to a function call. What am I missing here?",1344667939

I have written a distributed crawler at my startup Semantics3* - we track the price and metadata fields from all the major ecommerce sites.<p>Our crawler is written in perl. It uses an evented architecture (written using the AnyEvent library). We use Redis to store state (which urls have been crawled - using the hash- and determine which urls to crawl next - using sorted sets)<p>Instead of using a bloom filter we used sorted sets to dedupe urls and pick the highest priority urls to crawl next (some sort of priority queue).<p>For the actual distribution of crawling (the 'map reduce' part) we use the excellent Gearman work distribution server.<p>One major optimization i can suggest is caching the dns (and also do it asynchronously). You can save a lot of time and resources, especially at that scale, by simply caching dns requests. Another optimization would be to keep the socket connection open and do the download of all the pages from the same domain asynchronously.<p>*Shameless plug: We just launched our private beta.

The author does not deny that when you break down the US scores by ethnicity, Asian-Americans do as well as other Asians, European-Americans as other Europeans, etc. He bases a large part of his argument on the contention that the US should actually be doing better than it is right now - that ""we can do more"" - simply because we have a higher GDP per capita.<p>One example he cites is that the mean PISA score for Asian-Americans is 534, while the mean PISA score for Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong is 533. The author argues that since our GPP per capita is much higher than Japan / South Korea (and especially the Asian-American GDP per capita, which is probably slightly higher than the overall US number, given that Asian-American median income is about $1-2k higher than White median income), we should be doing better than we are now. This ignores, of course, that even this alleged observable underperformance must then be shared by Singapore and Hong Kong as well, which have higher GDP per capita (adjusted for purchasing power) than even the US (Singpore has $10k higher GDP per capita, in fact), but do only equally as well as US Asian-Americans / Japan / South Korea.<p>The author also argues that it the explosive growth of private tuition services are propping up US test scores, completely oblivious to the fact that the pervasiveness and ubiquity of private tuition services in many Asian countries (especially South Korea) make US private tuition services look like day care centers.<p>Finally, link-dumping 3 articles and a book that we'd have to purchase on Amazon really does not add much.",1344666284

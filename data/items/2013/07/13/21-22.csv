6038964,comment,6032944,6038528,1,0,clicks,,,"> There is nothing all that silly about it. It simply interprets the Constitution in the way you would a contract--based on what the parties intended the document to mean at the time of the agreement.<p>For contracts relating to small situations that would make sense, but for a piece of writing that is meant to apply to a whole country written by a few old men centuries ago is that really the most prudent choice?<p>We know so much more than they did -- e.g. science now tells us that we can actually quantify pain (both physical and emotional) with remarkable accuracy [1]. With the understanding and new knowledge that has become available in recent time it&#x27;s likely that the founders would have had a totally different take on things, so I see slow and small nitpicky rectifications on minor points to be misguided in numerous respects since for all one knows founders&#x27; approach to several issues would have been altogether different if they had access to the abundant new findings and data that has only become available recently.<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example: before I started getting into John Rawls writings, some contemporary philosophy (a lot of Sam Harris stuff), some writings on determinism, I was a libertarian. It was my access to new knowledge that informed my world view with a new and more scientifically rigorous take on things.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-04/brain-scans-offer-super-accurate-measure-burning-pain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-04/brain-scans-of...</a>",1373752713

6038863,comment,6032944,6036829,1,0,mpyne,,,"From the ruling given in 1942:<p>&quot;...an <i></i>enemy combatant<i></i> who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war, but to be offenders against the law of war subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals.&quot;<p>Likewise, from the very same two paragraphs you reference you would find that the Bush-definition of enemy combatant describes an &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; who has <i>no</i> right to POW status under Geneva or the LOAC.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that such civilian combatants have <i>no</i> rights whatsoever, but they are far limited compared to what Geneva provides for uniformed forces, and there is indeed precedent in international (and U.S.) law. For instance, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld was argued to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2004, which ruled (among other things) &quot;... repudiating the U.S. government&#x27;s unilateral assertion of executive authority to suspend the constitutional protections of individual liberty of a U.S. citizen. <i>The Court recognized the power of the government to detain unlawful combatants</i>, but ruled that detainees must have the ability to challenge their detention before an impartial judge.&quot;. Congress tried to clarify in 2006 with the &quot;Military Commissions Act of 2006&quot; which does indeed contain a definition of an unlawful enemy combatant (one not reliant solely on the will of the executive). Likewise, several Supreme Court rulings have further eroded the position taken by Bush regarding the legal rights afforded to unlawful combatants held in Gitmo and other places.<p>And going back to the subject <i>here</i> (of whether the executive can unilaterally declare Snowden to be an &#x27;enemy combatant&#x27; and send him to Gitmo): &quot;On 18 December 2003, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals declared that the Bush Administration lacked the authority to detain a U.S. citizen arrested on U.S. soil as an &quot;illegal enemy combatant&quot; without clear congressional authorization (per 18 U.S.C.  4001(a)); it consequently ordered the government to release Padilla from military custody within thirty days.&quot; (Padilla was a U.S. citizen arrested on U.S. soil).<p>But, that case ended up being thrown out on a technicality. When it was re-argued in the right court, they &quot;ordered the Bush administration to either charge Padilla or release him.&quot;. They relied for that ruling on the Supreme Court ruling I&#x27;d just mentioned.<p>So no, Snowden should be perfectly safe from treatment as any kind of weird unlawful combatant should he return. In fact the term &#x27;enemy combatant&#x27; was dropped in 2009 coincident to a certain regime change in the U.S.",1373751466

There has been dispelling of a lot of myths from both sides, but I do strongly feel all 10 of your rebuttals to the OP are narrow definitions of the points or exceptions, as a result of selection bias from the kinds of Americans or internationals you primarily interact with. Exemplified via hyperbole and mostly personal experience:\n1. Really, people are impressed when an American is like a &quot;normal&quot; person from the rest of the world: &quot;Wow you can speak some language other than your malformed version of english? Impressive! I can speak four -- my mothertongue, my national language, English, and some scrappy French from two years of high school. But it&#x27;s amazing that you grew up in America and can now speak two!&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t really call that being impressed.<p>2. Sure, America gets dumped on in media all over the world. And blamed for economic disparity across the world. But the general populace, as the OP states, really doesn&#x27;t think about America. It&#x27;s true. Unless they have a relative or a friend in America they think about, or there&#x27;s some global news going around, they really couldn&#x27;t care less, which = not hating. Which is why they give you a break -- they don&#x27;t care (although whether they should care is a different question)<p>3. Foreign language is not the only thing. Almost all of us can speak English, believe it or not. Just talk to us in English to get to know about us. And I&#x27;m amazed you can call American immigration &quot;open&quot; in the midst of all the conversation going on about it right now. I&#x27;m strongly led to believe you don&#x27;t know very many non-Americans entangled in immigration in the last 5 years. Myself, I&#x27;m getting the boot by the end of this year (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5708206"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5708206</a>). I&#x27;ll leave it at that, always a separate discussion.<p>Agreed, there are countries worse than America for immigration. But really, for all the immigrants, how many do you think nationals really interact with closely? How many of those are just outliers to the typical citizen of their respective countries? Large parts of the country that aren&#x27;t Atlanta, Seattle, Boston or California have very little cultural intermingling and really, Americans know little to nothing about the rest of the world there. Of course, there are world-aware Americans and those who interact with others. This is a terrible terrible minority. And I suspect you have a selection bias here, where you probably interact with (and are one of) those kinds of people more than your average bumpkin who only cares about a 50 mile radius of his existence.<p>4. I completely agree with you here, countries like South Korea and many parts of India are far more ridiculously poor at self-expression than America. The author&#x27;s expression is compared to the most open cultures in the world.<p>5. Of us immigrants, I imagine a large number do it because of proximity (Mexicans/South Americans), and relatively better, yes. Immigrants from other developed countries are here not for the standard of living, but for the innovative economy and career opportunities, fun products to work on, etc. The American Dream, in practice, is a thing of the past, and to people still groping for it, it&#x27;s a delusion. People in those countries just aren&#x27;t advertised to by any other country (like Sweden or Finland) as much as by the US via popular media. For the record, my quality of life here is certainly below where it would be if I worked a job commensurate to my qualifications back in India or the Middle East, but I love my work here more than anything I could see myself doing back home, as the markets exist today.<p>6. Yes, the US is a developed country. So it would be unfair to really compare it to most of the world. A lot of places really are slum-ridden shitholes (inside the US too, but moreso outside), but a LOT of places aren&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t see why you really disagree with the author here.<p>7. I&#x27;m sure you aren&#x27;t paranoid, and I&#x27;m glad you aren&#x27;t raising your kids to be. Again, I call selection bias on you calling baloney on this. If you pick any article that talks about international anything on the internet, and read a couple comments, you&#x27;ll hear how paranoid they are about foreigners, about crime, about the government, about bomb threats, terrorists, etc. A lot of it is grounded, a lot of it plain stupid. The media, law-enforcement and public reactions to events in general all depict this paranoia, and a lot of it is grounded in Americans believing the rest of the world is out to get them and ruin their pretty lives (goes back to point 2).<p>8. This is probably true over the entire world. Maybe you don&#x27;t seek status, but my parents, my friends, my cousins, and I&#x27;m sure to a great extent, myself, all are pretty status-obsessed and seek attention. Americans have eaten up social media tools more aggressively than most of the world (not surprising given most of it started here) and so seem more explicitly attention-seeking, but really, the whole world does this. That&#x27;s being human in a society.<p>9. Long lifespans and being &quot;healthy&quot; are correlated, but not equivalent. However, there are definitely worse health problems over most of the world. In fact, I think more Americans think the country is unhealthier than it actually is. However, healthcare is definitely <i>cheaper</i> in the rest of the world. If I had to do serious surgery, it would cost me far less to buy a two-way plane ticket to India and pay for the best hospital and doctors the country can provide there than try to go to a default hospital here in California to get it fixed. If only I didn&#x27;t have such visa issues if I tried to do that...<p>10. Do you really feel you are representative of Americans choosing to not pick a penis-car and go for homeschooling and encourage multiculturism and human relationships? People I know who I never thought would mistake comfort for happiness when they were in college, have rapidly turned into those looking for &quot;nicer&quot; suburban houses, routine expensive getaways and big televisions, and, believe it or not, penis cars. However, this is true in a lot of the world wherever people have significantly more than the baseline required money, and I don&#x27;t think is an exclusively American thing either.",1373751096

New research from some of the leading housing \n  economists in the country, however, examines the long \n  history of mortgage market innovations and suggests that \n  regulators should be mindful of the potential downside in \n  tightening too much. ...\n \n  These economists followed thousands of people over their   \n  lives and examined the evidence for whether mortgage \n  markets have become more efficient over time. Lost in the \n  current discussion about borrowers income levels in the \n  subprime market is the fact that someone with a low income \n  now but who stands to earn much more in the future would, \n  in a perfect market, be able to borrow from a bank to buy a \n  house.

In \n  retrospect, it shouldnt have been hard to notice the rise \n  of shadow banking, banking that is carried out by non- \n  depository institutions such as investment banks financing \n  themselves through repo. And it shouldnt have been hard to \n  realize that an institution using overnight borrowing to \n  invest in longer-term and somewhat illiquid assets was \n  inherently vulnerable to something functionally equivalent \n  to a classic bank run  and, furthermore, that the \n  institutions doing this were neither backed by deposit \n  insurance nor effectively regulated. Economists, of all \n  people, should have been on guard for the fallacy of \n  misplaced concreteness, should have realized that not \n  everything that functions like a bank and creates bank-type \n  systemic risks looks like a traditional bank, a big marble \n  building with rows of tellers.\n\n  And I plead guilty to falling into that fallacy. I was \n  vaguely aware of the existence of a growing sector of \n  financial institutions that didnt look like conventional \n  banks, and werent regulated like conventional banks, but \n  engaged in bank-like activities. Yet I gave no thought to \n  the systemic risks.\n\n  Even more broadly, economists should have been aware of the \n  dangers of leverage. This was hardly a new concern. Back in \n  1933  yes, 1933  Irving Fisher published his classic \n  paper on debt deflation, that is, on the way high levels of \n  debt create the possibility of a self-reinforcing downward \n  spiral. And the paper remains astonishingly relevant; aside \n  from a few archaisms of style it could have been written \n  from todays headlines. So remembering Fisher all by itself \n  should have been enough to rouse at least a few worries as \n  household debt rose dramatically relative to income, not \n  just in America, but in a number of European nations too.\n\n  Again, I plead guilty to negligence. I had especially \n  little excuse for being oblivious to these dangers given \n  that I had actually laid great stress on balance-sheet \n  factors in causing financial crises in emerging market. \n  True, those crises had a lot to do with currency mismatch  \n  basically, private debt in other countries currencies, so \n  that a speculative attack on a currency could quickly \n  translate into a crippling collapse of domestic demand. But \n  I and others should have seen that this was only one \n  possible channel for balance-sheet crises, that plunges in \n  housing prices or for that matter income could have the \n  same effect.</code></pre>",1373750233

Per picture #2, you can see that this mixer accepts 32 audio signals as inputs and can route them to 16 different outputs, with varying degrees of additional signal processing along the way. In a studio or live situation, you do use broadly similar configurations from day to day - eg you may default to always putting the drums on channels 1-8, even if that leaves a few channels unused sometimes - but it&#x27;s never exactly the same and sometimes the requirements can be radically different. Part of a sound engineer&#x27;s skill is being able to keep track of what sound sources are assigned to what channel and mix the signals in some musically or narratively appropriate fashion (eg for a dialog and FX in a movie). Now, one can do that on autopilot for perhaps 8 channels but for 16, 24, or 32 that&#x27;s not practical. The traditional way of dealing with this is to put a tape strip along the bottom and write down what the channels are assigned to; some engineers swear by a product which consists of colored magnetic tiles that attach to the (usually steel) panelwork of the mixer.<p>Here, dynamic LCD buttons are used to good effect in a realtime situation where performance matters, albeit not in the life-and-death way of an aircraft cockpit.",1373749243

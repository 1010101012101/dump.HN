If I send it to your company, I've done at least a couple hours of research on your company (home page, crunchbase, glassdoor, first page of G results, etc) and written a custom cover letter explaining why I'm interested, where I think I fit, what I can do for this company in particular, and how I think that matches its needs.  Good companies, in particular, send an email saying yes, no, or maybe inside two days (to an interview, obviously, not to a job).  And if the answer is no, it's not personal; just not the right fit / right time etc.<p>Companies that don't email me back?  I keep a spreadsheet with their names.  Companies that don't give me a quick no thanks email after a phone screen or test or in person interview?  I actively share that blacklist with friends.<p>Edit: Also, companies that email me back promptly -- even if the answer is no -- go on my spreadsheet of companies to look at first next time I'm thinking about a new job.

1326092,comment,1325253,1325747,0,0,marcamillion,,,"Well...the Greece situation is a horrible state. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. What Greece has done to date is an inordinate amount of spending (financed by cheap Euro loans from banks all over the Euro) - think of what caused the credit crisis in America (people spending money they didn't have - by leveraging their house, etc.).<p>Ok...well now those loans are coming due, and Greece has further compounded their problem by essentially lying about the state of their finances. Eurostat (an EU watch dog) recently released a report confirming that Greece has essentially been lying about the bad state of it's finances and revised their budget deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio upwards - <a href=""http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/publications/collections/news_releases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/publicat...</a><p>Then, to add insult to injury Standard & Poors recently downgraded Greece's gov't bond ratings to junk status. That basically means that if they wanted to borrow money from the international capital markets, they would pay much higher interest than say Germany. That was expected though, because news was slowly being released that Greece is in a much worse state than they are letting on. The downgrade just 'solidified' it.<p>Now, in terms of the domino effect, every country in the Eurozone is connected by a number of elements. The eurozone is the largest economic area of cooperation on the planet (geographically). All the countries use the same currency, but not all are controlled by one central bank. Each country has their own individual central bank. But they all share a promise that no one will let any fail, because that invalidates the purpose of the single currency. It would be the equivalent of California going bankrupt. The Federal government will never let that happen, because it would undermine the entire union.<p>Anyway, so the other countries within the Eurozone that have a similar fiscal profile as Greece are Portugal, Italy, Ireland & Spain (also known as the 'PIIGS'). By similar fiscal profile I mean that whatever happens to Greece, something similar will have to happen to the others. So if Greece is allowed to bankrupt, then investors fear the same thing will happen to the others. If Greece is bailed out, then the same will happen to the others. It really is damned if you do, damned if you don't, because if Greece is bailed out - then they are essentially being 'rewarded' for their profligate spending and 'devious' fiscal behavior over the years. But if they don't bail out Greece, the entire Euro will likely collapse. So they have no choice, assuming they want to preserve the Euro. If they bail out Greece though, moral hazard is created because the other countries are essentially given a guarantee that the Euro authorities (and IMF) will not allow them to go bankrupt either.<p>All in all, every countries banks have extended loans to (and bought bonds from) companies, governments, and individuals in other countries. So if the debtor defaults, many banks throughout the EU will have an increasing amount of bad loans on their balance sheet - which could force their governments to bail them out (provided the defaults are big enough). Not only that, but credit will dry further and companies that rely on short-term financing for purchasing inventory and paying employees will go out of business because they can't get access to this financing (i.e. the financial crisis will restart). That will then spread to America, the UK, etc.<p>I know this has been pretty verbose and might be a bit confusing, but I hope that kinda sheds some light on the situation.<p><a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63Q3FF20100427"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63Q3FF20100427</a><p>P.S.

If the demand is elastic, they would have sold more than 10 times the amount and would net a profit by decreasing the price.  If the demand is inelastic they would have sold less than 10x and made less money.  Ultimately this is an empirical question that can be tested and validated.  Once you know the elasticity of demand (as it is called) for a product, you can calculate the optimal price.  e.g. the price that will yield the highest profit to the company.<p>It's very easy to say what you think the price should be, but the preferred method is to empirically test it and get the optimal value that way.  It's a lot easier for the OmniGroup to run a sale and test the change in sales once they have some baseline sales numbers.  In almost all cases it's better to be on the high side of the optimal price point and come down to it.<p>For those interested in starting their own company, it's easy and tempting to start with too low of a price.

While the harsh feedback was painful at times, it was important for us to hear.<p>We are sincerely grateful for the advice and criticism that we got from the very smart people on HN.  The conversations we have had with people here were instrumental in our understanding what was bothering people about Scribd, and how to fix it.<p>Today we're launching the largest product change ever on Scribd, and one that goes directly to the heart of those concerns.  We are leaving Flash and moving to all HTML5.<p>The #1 problem people had with Scribd was the Flash reading experience.  Scrolling was problematic, you said.  It didn't respect your browser's search, text selection, or keyboard shortcuts.  It didn't feel like your PDF reader, either, and it was missing functionality you expected in a document reader.  Sometimes it slowed down or crashed your browser.<p>At a higher level, people challenged why we were using Flash to display documents in the first place.  A lot of you suggested we build a Google books style viewer, using AJAX and images.<p>We ended up taking that suggestion, but we took it a step further. Rather than building yet another reading application based on images, we used the magic new stuff in HTML5 to convert documents into fully native webpages.  It took us a while because we built this from scratch, and it was hard to do.<p>The result is that the reading experience on Scribd is now incredibly light and fast.  It's no different, really, from reading a blog, since it's all in plain HTML yet it still preserves the exact complex and rich formatting of the original document.  While it's an early beta product, I think it is already way better.  But don't take my word for it - try it yourself:<p>http://www.scribd.com/html5<p>What is Scribd, anyway?\nThere’s been a lot of confusion among HN readers over what Scribd is supposed to do, and I want to clear it up.  The point of Scribd is, most emphatically, <i>not</i> to replace your PDF viewer, and that’s why we encourage users to download documents in whatever format they want.  If you try to think of Scribd as an Acrobat/Preview/Foxit competitor you’ll never understand it.  The purpose of Scribd is two-fold:\n1) For authors/publishers: to provide a place where they can publish their book, essay, presentation, magazine, legal document, poem, catalog, scientific paper, etc. to a wide audience\n2) For readers: To provide a place where you will occasionally find interesting content generally not available elsewhere and make it easy to share that content with your social graph.<p>Scribd’s real value is in the unique content – not available elsewhere – that we have added to the web. It is that store of content and the community around it that has made Scribd popular among authors, students, business professionals, musicians, cooks, companies, publishers, and other wide-ranging types of people.<p>What HN made clear was that while building out that community, we could not ignore the reading experience itself.  When you find an interesting document on Scribd, you expect to be able to read it in an easy, natural way.   That’s what we’ve tried to build.<p>Feedback\nWhen we've gotten feedback from HN, it has ended up dramatically improving the product.  I have every reason to expect the same will happen this time.  And I think we've shown that we do pay attention to what gets written here.  So, please, tell us what you think in the comments (or email me directly).  Kindly keep the discussion to the reading experience itself for now – that’s what we’re really trying to improve.<p>What else can we do to make Scribd the best reading experience on the web?  The whole team at Scribd is anxiously waiting to hear your answer.",1273187317

33297,comment,33246,33256,0,0,jey,,,"Then by your measure, is Perl the most-LFSP language out there? I think Perl reads like line noise. High-density syntax with clear, simple concepts is a desirable feature in a language. Assigning some function to every possible permutation of symbols (a la Perl) is just stupid. Ruby falls into the ""just stupid"" bin in this case.",1184004836

It's a nice language and all, but I still prefer Python over Ruby since Python is a simple, clean and elegant language with just a small number of elegant concepts.",1184004569

If he'd sold OSX by dryly listing its features, you might think ""ah, UNIX, yeah, probably good idea, failed before with AUX, though"". But when Jobs described OSX to people, they came away thinking ""wow, this is a major leap in operating systems design."" Part of this is pure charisma and great delivery. Another part of it is just a knack for picking up on genuinely great aspects of a product that others might not think to highlight.",1184004159

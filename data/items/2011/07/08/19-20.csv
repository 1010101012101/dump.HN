Since the thief is in the wrong, he controls the risk. But you also control the risk in the situation described, where you choose to meet the thief and take your laptop back. You <i>both</i> had an opportunity to make other choices.<p><i>My instinct is that if someone does a self-motivated major immoral harm to you, are in a position to relieve or remove that harm and chooses not to then you're pretty much justified in carrying out any pre-warned harm against them.</i><p>So for instance, if a thief is running away from me carrying my laptop, may I tell them to ""Stop or I'll shoot?""<p>This is one of those things where different cultures take different positions.

It's been born out of the numerous scientific studies done that continually show that by saying to a child 'I am very proud of the effort you put forth on X' as opposed to saying 'You're so smart! You studied hard and got a B instead of a C!' you are placing the emphasis on something the child has control over (their effort), over something which is innate (their natural ability).<p>I agree with you that learning to work hard is not a worthy goal on its own, but the praise effort vs ability debate isn't about encouraging a child to work hard but simply to praise them on what they have control over (their effort) vs their innate abilities.<p><i>Now, when it comes to child psychology and keeping a child engaged, maybe you're right and it's better to praise effort. But that should not come at the expense of praising intelligence; ""intelligence"" is the end product of many years of effort directed at the process of learning and thinking, not something that's doled out of a box at birth.</i><p>This idea of praising effort vs ability has been discussed previously here, so instead of repeating it I'll just link to it :)<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2237874"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2237874</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2562632"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2562632</a>",1310155008

And responses like ""Great job, even though you did poorly on that math test you studied really hard!"" are not helpful if you actually want someone to get better. [Note: I'm not saying that ""Bad Timmy, you clearly suck at math and I'm giving you an F!"" is any better, though unfortunately belief in that false dichotomy is pretty common in the world of education]<p>When someone ""intelligent"" gets a bad grade on a math test despite having studied hard, they realize that something is wrong with the way they studied.  Or that they have a deficiency in earlier material that they need to correct.  Or that they need to sleep more before the test.  Etc.  They never accept that they didn't work hard enough (they did!), and they never accept that they're not smart enough (they are!) - they assume that they somehow worked <i>wrong</i>, and they set about fixing that problem.<p>When someone ""unintelligent"" gets a bad grade on a test, they chalk it up to the fact that they're not very good at math, but hey, they tried hard, and that's what's important, right?<p>That's <i>not</i> what's important.  Learning to work hard is not a worthy goal on its own if you don't learn to work <i>better</i> at the same time (or at least it's not the most worthy goal).  This is as true in programming as it is anywhere.<p>Now, when it comes to child psychology and keeping a child engaged, maybe you're right and it's better to praise effort.  But that should not come at the expense of praising intelligence; ""intelligence"" is the end product of many years of effort directed at the process of learning and thinking, not something that's doled out of a box at birth.  Unfortunately it's something that we've never really learned to effectively teach, which is a shame.<p>[Edit: I'm also not claiming that there's no natural difference in smarts that <i>does</i> come ""for free"" at birth, there is absolutely some sort of Bell curve happening there, and some people are destined to be at the high and low ends of it, for sure.  But my point is that the way the people at the top handle failure is vastly different from the way people at the bottom handle it, in that they're never satisfied with mere effort.]",1310153752

A few observations:<p>1) The first time you teach a class, it's incredibly hard and time consuming, but the difficulty drops like a logarithm to a relatively low plateau after you've done it a few times.<p>2) At one point I thought about teaching high school English. Seattle Public Schools paid $36K / yr with a Masters or $30K / yr without starting, and those numbers topped at around $70K and $55K after 30 years (IIRC, Bellevue Public School teachers made something like ~10K more). That doesn't count retirement; teaching is unusual because a lot of the benefits are backloaded in the form of retirement pay. One woman in my grad program taught English for 26 years in Michigan and took an early retirement offer; I think she gets 70% of her last year's salary for life. Granted, those deals are going away because of the budget crisis, but a lot of the retirement stuff is still baked in.<p>3) You can multiply those numbers by 1.2 or so because teachers only have mandatory work for nine months of the year.<p>4) After two to three years, you effectively can't be fired because of union rules (unless you sleep with a student and get caught in a flagrant manner, don't show up, etc.). See this post: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2009/11/12/susan-engel-doesnt-get/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2009/11/12/susan-engel-doesnt-get/</a> for lots of citations on that, as well as a lot of the information that's going into this comment.

To say that ""teachers make shit"" isn't really true. It is to true to say that teachers have back-loaded compensation packages that tend to be high in benefits (e.g. good health care, retirement) and low in upfront salary.<p>My smaller impression is that most teachers I had didn't seem to work that hard after their first three - four years of teaching.",1310153259

Their consumption was some 55% of GDP in the 90's. Then it came down to 46% around 2000 and now it stands at 34%. [[1]] All the efforts that China made to increase consumption didn't materialise. The fast growing Chinese GDP is only giving an illusion that Chinese people are massively consuming. But that's not true.<p>On the other hand, the percentage of fixed-investment (roads, bridges etc.) to GDP has been steadily increasing in China. If Jim Chanos is to be believed, the fixed-investment now stands at a whopping 70% of GDP. [[2]] This seems to be the actual lifeline of Chinese economy.<p>So in order to maintain the GDP growth, China has been recklessly building roads, bridges etc. fuelled by local government debts. [[3]] This has been creating massive bad-loans, over-investments and bubbles. China is building not <i>'because of'</i> its economy. It is building <i>'for the sake of'</i> its economy. This won't see a happy ending.<p>[[1]] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-16/consumers-fade-in-china-economy-racked-by-inflation-with-peak-days-gone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-16/consumers-fade-in-c...</a><p>[[2]] <a href=""http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/jim-Chanos-Soft-Landing/2011/02/02/id/384774"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/jim-Chanos-Soft-Landing/...</a><p>[[3]] <a href=""http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/features/why-china39s-local-government-debt-is-so-scary_563013.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/features/why-china39s-local...</a>",1310152905

Sometimes it's just honest surprise, like a guy I know that was shocked the person he talked to occasionally over text and had respect for being pretty good at what I played was female the whole time. Most times it's just someone being an idiot. Usually the latter seems to be because there is some kind of anonymity involved (see also: <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/3/19/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/3/19/</a>).

I never claimed women weren't capable of doing that. I have participated in female-majority communities where the men were hit on and treated badly, and I didn't like it. Everyone needs to treat others with respect as much as possible.<p>2. A big part in whether or not that is acceptable behavior from <i>anybody</i> is if the other person is/people are okay with it. I feel okay flirting and hitting on others when I know the interest is mutual, and I don't feel bad doing it. I can be as sexually suggestive and crude as I want in front of friends and people I know. What is distasteful is doing this to someone that doesn't want any part of it. What is also distasteful is misreading someone's behavior as implicit permission to do things like hit on them.<p>> otherwise there's very little difference in the way that people act towards people that they suspect to be girls online<p>I like to subscribe to the theory that the vast majority of people are somewhat reasonable. Most of the time there isn't a difference and that is where I'm perfectly fine being open about who/what I am.

Malaria also has a 3-day pre-roll period where you know you are about to get malaria, but you are not yet in bed. Also, Malaria is the #1 drug every chemist stocks in malaria-infested areas. Furthermore, taking a malaria pill even if you don't have malaria has no side effect.<p>What this means is that if all the criteria of bad luck come together:<p>1. Person does not know the symptoms for malaria<p>2. There is no chemist around who stocks malaria pills<p>3. The illness for some reason instantly hits the person without the pre-roll period<p>...then the person for whom all these criteria comes into question is about 99.99% not likely to have an Android phone around.

2743665,comment,2743258,2743549,2,0,sorbus,,,"The current tests have very low accuracy (the article says 40%). These tests are likely being administered by trained professionals, and if the cost of each test is sufficiently high (for materials, and that it would take several tests to get a reasonably accurate answer), it might be cheaper in the long run (or even short periods of time) to buy these medical professionals smartphones and the lenses instead of the supplies for existing tests. If the cost of a smartphone and lens is greater than a full microscope with a webcam attached (to allow the computer or a dedicated device to do the analysis), then smartphones are still a useful proof of concept as well as being far more portable and being easier to power.<p>It doesn't seem logical on the face, but once you start adding up costs it's quite likely that it would be, especially if they can convince a smartphone manufacturer to donate a few hundred or thousand units (I'm sure that there are smartphone manufacturers donating money to the anti-malaria efforts already, as it's good publicity and can be used in advertising. Donating smartphones instead of money is a very small step, as well as possibly cheaper - the retail price for a smartphone is not the price of manufacture).",1310151907

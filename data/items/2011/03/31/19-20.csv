I'm dealing with one for the last year, and enjoy reading about them whenever I can. Thanks for the article.<p>One problem for your approach would be handling of deletions. You should visit all the recipient feeds to delete the item, and it's not that uncommon.<p>Another one is handling comments, which is the real thing creating the buzz if you're providing the feed for the network effect. The article assumes a twitter like publishing if I got it right. In a Facebook like feed, you may want to include a couple of comments with the original item to display the action (first two is always displayed with the feed item, for examle)and async. load the rest. You may want to keep the exact number of comments to display something like ""6 more comments"", and this means updating all the copies with every comment.<p>There's also the problem of changing permissions, if you have one. In my case, a parenting social network, user can set feed permission to ""family only"" or ""friends"" or ""my partner"" etc. anytime, hence adding and deleting again to other user's feed in your case.",1301601588

Whether IQ is highly heritable depends on whether you define it as the result of the test or something that the tests are trying to measure.<p>A lot of tests tend to embed a ton of middle-upper-class cultural touchstones that you don't even realize are there until you find yourself explaining them to a test-taker who's never been camping or on a boat.<p>EDIT:  The concept of ""intelligence"" that IQ purports to measure is probably highly heritable as well, of course.

WP seriously began to lag Word in the 90s.  While WP wss the undisputed king in MSDOS, on Windows it was buggy and late.  Office 95 in particular was pretty crushing.<p>Borland was somewhat similar.  They had a good set of dev tools, and for example, their C++ compiler was blindingly fast and the VCL was relatively clean (at least compared to MFC).  But around VC 4.0 that began to change (at least build speed).  VC started to beat Borland in build time and seemed to spread its lead in code quality.  This coupled with a better IDE made is Visual C++ become the more common choice.  Although I also think the strength of VB played a large role in the uptake in VC.  No data to back it up, but anecdotcally I saw a lot of ISV shops bring VC along, because they were building a lot of internal tools with VB (and no one really had anything to compete with VB).<p>And lets be clear...

I think the video is tasteless and in many ways vile. However, I want to comment specifically on trophy hunting.<p>In my opinion, allowing big game hunters to pay for trophy animals is an important and integral part of animal conservation. In many impoverished African countries, their is little to no government funding to conserve animals.<p>Yes, there are risk factors. But personally, I believe the additional amount of animals that are killed due to the argument of excess demand is a lot less than the number of animals saved by the increased funding for poaching prevention.<p>Furthermore, I believe the economic benefits of this to the local community hugely improve the lives of the local people (who I believe are a lot more important than the elephants, as important as I think the elephants are), and that this improvement will decrease poaching.<p>To summarize: \n- I agree that Trophy hunting can have negative effects. \n- However, I believe the positives for animal conservation of Trophy Hunting offset the negatives in two major ways. \n- Trophy Hunting decreases the ease with which poaching takes place by funding anti-poaching measures. \n- Trophy Hunting decreases the extent to which poaching takes place by improving the situation of the local communities.<p>So if you are pro animal conservation, and pro human rights, you should be pro Trophy Hunting.

I, and many others, would not trust the OS nearly as much if they included things like Flash or other binary only blobs.  These binary blobs could be doing anything.  We know Flash works against the user's interest, and who knows what other binary piece might do?<p>Secondly, how would they license?  Most of the code they could license requires a charge per copy.  RedHat , Ubuntu and most Linux distros encourage the free redistribution of their disks.  You can download it for free(aside from bandwidth charges which RedHat is not involved with.  They don't even know how many copies are really in use.  So, either they would have to change their whole distribution model or they would have to pay for something that is fairly nebulous. Fluendo has published a version of the MP3 codec that can be distributed for free.  They purchased a license that has no per copy costs, but that is unusual to even have that as an option.<p>Finally, the RedHat company produces the RedHat distro for commercial use and the Fedora distro for home use.  There is an active community of Fedora users who happily use it after 5 PM and you can find how to get most codecs working in Fedora, if you search a bit.  The freedoms associated with Linux make it much more pleasant to use that any proprietary solution available today.  I would also say Linux is more powerful and easy to use, but I can see how not everyone would agree about those, since your experience and workflows can drive those comparisons.  OpenSolaris was making good progress.  It is a shame it was killed a little before it got to the point where it was usable for everyday duty for the average person.",1301599009

2393090,comment,2392952,2392952,1,0,gojomo,,,"I started to write a comment that suggested 'Ebeats' was no better than just trying to popularize GMT/""Z"" time for coordination.  These Ebeats <i>are</i> GMT-based; their benefit is that by their format they can't be confused with TZ-based times; their problem is they don't mentally map to the old divisions like hours and minutes.<p>But the more I think about the problem, the more I suspect that the instant-distinction is the key success factor. I can imagine future calendaring software always showing both customary local time and Ebeats alongside each time-range. It'd still be hard to casually set an Ebeats meeting time, without your software open, but with software open it becomes easy.<p>The one refinement I would suggest to prevent day-rollover confusion would be to add an optional one-letter A-G prefix to each Ebeat time specifying the GMT day-of-week. Thus without including the whole traditional, locally-varying (2011-03m-31d) date or day-of-week (Thursday/Th/R), or relative phrasing (""Tomorrow""), any off-by-one day errors can be avoided.<p>By this convention, the Ebeats time right now is @d792. This time tomorrow will be @e792.<p>(A potential problem is that 'f' now means GMT Saturday. Moving the first-day 'a' back to Sunday makes 'f' line up nicely with Friday, but goes against ISO/international practice calling Monday the first day. I suppose another convention for getting a day-of-week 'check-digit' in would be a 1-7, but set off somehow to avoid confusion with beats... eg @4.792 or @4d792 or 4@792.)",1301598170

Android will help push the move from QR to NFC, but QR needs to be kept alive for a while still.",1301598154

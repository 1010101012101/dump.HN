3233896,comment,3233526,3233526,5,0,Strilanc,,,"Note to everyone: don't confuse 'try-catch sucks' with 'exceptions suck'.<p>There's no inherent reason an exception-throwing method can't be invoked in a style that gives back a value/exception pair. That limitation is a property of the specific language, not all languages. For example: exceptions could be caught succinctly if method invocations prefixed with 'catch' returned a value|exception tuple (`v, ex = catch ParseInt(""test"")`).<p>The primary difference between exceptions and error codes is the default behavior. Error codes default to 'ignore' and exceptions default to 'propagate'. The rest of the differences (requiring acknowledgement, succinctness of handling, availability of stack traces) are more of a coincidence based on the common decisions in languages like Java, Go, C, C++, python, etc.<p>I think the main downside of existing exception implementations is they discourage programmers from defining useful error cases for functions. It's so easy to propagate or suppress that anything else feels like massive busy work. Simple improvements would be to make wrapping exceptions easy and defining new types easy (throws FileNotFound as forge MissingNetConfigFile).<p>On the other hand, the main downside of error code implementations is the ease of ignoring. Go has a very good idea in the ""x, _ = funcWithIgnoredError"" style, but it extends poorly to otherwise-void methods like 'flush stream'.",1321278566

If you believe that 'meh' should be there in your program, it's fine to 'let it raise an exception'.<p>However, if 'meh' <i>could</i> be there, it's better to use an error style such as:<p><pre><code>  x = some_dict.getDefault('meh', 'some-neutral-value')\n</code></pre>\nAnd continue without raising because there's <i>no need</i> to raise as there's nothing exceptional here.<p>Ideally, raising an exception should have the meaning ""Hey, something is wrong here and I don't know what to do next"". And <i>someone</i> in the call hierarchy would handle this and say ""Oh, the connection stopped.. that's why it's not working. I'll reconnect and call you again"".<p>And note that this ""parent handling"" might be way higher than where the problem occurred..",1321278511
3233894,comment,3233156,3233156,4,0,apaprocki,,,"While this tagged pointer construct is pretty common but makes some people wretch, realize that the entire web is built upon this same concept, only bigger. The nan/nun-boxing that is used by various dynamic engines (e.g. All JS engines) relies on the fact that pointers on x86-64 hardware only use 48-bits of memory address space. They use the remaining 16 bits in the double for flags pertaining to what type of object it is. This has a nasty side effect of preventing these engines from running on any 64-bit architecture that does not have this memory address space restriction (e.g. Sparc, POWER). One either has to force the environment to only allocate space out of the lower 48-bits or come up with some other kind of encoding scheme to indicate if the address is a ""far"" address and should be added to the 48-bit base.",1321278497

I cannot tell you how many times I would have killed for Lisp-like conditions. If I were to tell you that, however, I would also have to tell you that most of the killing would have been in vain.<p>The trouble with the never-ending ""try-catch versus conditions versus return codes versus fail-fast"" argument is that there is no easy way to have the conversation about big swaths of code. The log parser is a great example, yes, but it is exceedingly simple. The fact is that 'low' in the linked example is exposing its guts to 'high' whether it likes it or not, and that in any reasonably large body of code this too can become unmanageable.<p>Wherever you see a religious war, your Spidey sense should be tingling, telling you: people are arguing over which tool is better for all jobs when in fact you might want to learn all of the tools and choose the best whenever possible. And that you will at times show up to a job site where they're using the wrong tool and you'll have to learn to change them or live with it -- whichever makes more sense/is more possible.<p>That said, sometimes consistency just wins out.

Truth is it's lagging behind, it does not enjoy good community support (everybody in the *nix community is against it) and to top it Novell was acquired recently and the new management put a lid on mono. Miguel has started a new company but it seems their priority is standing on their feet first ( making money and being profitable). So, no. Mono is not a good alternative for .net at this point.",1321275672

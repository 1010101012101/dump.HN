10890745,comment,10887978,10889233,0,0,iheartmemcache,,,"It&#x27;s absolutely no surprise that they&#x27;re not factoring ad-revenue in. If you have a market  with people who have the intent to purchase (a la Zillow) as well as the means, that traffic is worth about as much as commercial insurance leads or recruiter leads for a good candidate. The estimate made by the grand-father poster is right in terms of how startups are traditionally valued; however, I&#x27;d argue that you&#x27;re not a traditional SaaS (that tends to see explosive growth).<p>Grow it like a small business or find someone who&#x27;s a professional real estate agent with extensive experience in the online markets, and figure out an edge. Whether it&#x27;s selling insurance affiliate services or something else along the lines of that, what you have right now is a very valuable entity that&#x27;s being severely under-capitalized.<p>The fact that you have paying users is indicative that youve generated trust and deliver value. Right now you&#x27;re in a powerful position. I&#x27;m assuming most of that affiliate marketing is for creditkarma credit checks/mortgage prequalification leads. I&#x27;m not sure what your numbers are in terms of conversions but I can tell you definitively with the traffic youre pushing you&#x27;re at the point where you can call up those agencies and threaten to take your business elsewhere unless they make an offer to increase your rate. If you&#x27;re going through an affiliate marketing program, they&#x27;re taking a cut between you and the lender. You have the power in that relationship (that is, you leave and he loses all his revenue without any recourse; if he leaves you, you can just sign up with someone else who&#x27;ll happily take your leads). Alternatively, I&#x27;ve seen deals go through where mid-sized regional banks offer a massive rate for exclusivity.<p>Those numbers are great especially for mobile. If you do sell it, sell a chunk of it (~30%, no more than 49%, you want to retain ownership on this trust me. He might want majority, in which case the middle-ground is to structure the deal with buy-out terms that are amenable to both parties, allowing you to essentially defer the large decision of selling a potentially profitable, under-utilized business until you see how it develops) for _significantly_ more than that 270k-350k estimate. The reason Zillow/Redfin/etc are making an offer right now (whatever they&#x27;re offering, ask for 3x) is because they know how valuable your traffic is and are aware that you&#x27;re undercapitalizing that traffic. If you find the right person who has experience in that market and offer him that 30% ownership with a huge incentive bonus for any revenue growth that&#x27;s beyond the estimated growth curve.<p>Think about it this way: 250k is the price of a moderately decent house in a non-major city. If a real estate agent manages to close 20 deals over the course of 3 years at a little over 6 houses a year at 250k, he has already passed your one-time revenue cash out at 250k. I can safely say that at least 20 agents are making their 6% rip a week because of your site with those numbers.<p>Those SEO numbers are insanely good, especially since mobile is so important in housing sales (e.g., 100k will get you a fantastic app that someone can turn on when they&#x27;re driving through a neighborhood they like, and you can sell those listings to agents for premium access for 200-300/mo. Compare that to reddit where mobile-aware doesn&#x27;t add much to the value proposition).<p>Email me if you want to chat more. Contact information is in my profile.",1452635998

10890728,comment,10881413,10881413,0,0,6stringmerc,,,"Very interesting reflection on identity in the modern world as it relates to family, fame, and trajedy. I have to say that the situation does feel very familiar to me based on some other readings and historical examples. I&#x27;ll explain. The most prominent correlative is with respect to Hunter S. Thompson. He created Raoul Duke as a character, and Gonzo Journalism as the method by which to report and embellish/comment on the world.<p>I view it very much as a &#x27;persona&#x27; and, in my opinion, most all highly intelligent individuals - especially those in the public eye - <i>must</i> have one (or quickly develop one) in order to cope with the needs of being self-confident to carry forward with beliefs and goals and values, yet also be able to &quot;put down the microphone&quot; and live a wholesome, personal life. This is the elements of celebrity and notariety that are weaved into the essay, and it&#x27;s very touching to see the care expressed toward himself, his brother, and trying to understand and work through the behavior of outsiders. Aaron, from what I saw and recall, had a very prominent persona. It&#x27;s pretty much &#x27;immortality&#x27; in the Achilles sense.<p>To me, and this is just from one musician and writer who has embraced using pen names and personas for years, this article is very useful to give some thought and consideration to how, generally speaking, US society and culture has decided to value &#x27;authenticity&#x27; and &#x27;transparency&#x27; to the point of being a little bit intrusive. I&#x27;m possibly under-stating it, but I also don&#x27;t want to get too far away from what the essay is conveying to me. It&#x27;s an affirmation of a perspective I formed and was guided to form as a youth in the arts: Notariety, whatever its source, has significant baggage.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r31hV_BPFf0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r31hV_BPFf0</a>",1452635838

So I&#x27;m fully on board with the concept.<p>But frankly, the execution seems lacking. The qrcode/sms polling is fine, if you care about that sort of thing, but there are many similar and better solutions [1] out there. \nYou can already mirror and do remote displays easily even with stock powerpoint/ooffice/keynote.<p>The one feature this and UW CP really bring is the annotation. In UW CP, especially my hacked version, the annotation tools are very good quality. You can use an active pen (e.g. wacomm digitizer on a Lenovo laptop/tablet) for accurate writing and drawing, and it has very low latency response, pressure sensitive line width, etc. In software you can zoom slides, delete/move annotations, change colors and pen types via a tablet-friendly palette. You can save your annotations and import them back into ppt as &quot;ink&quot; objects, and vice versa.<p>I don&#x27;t see any of that in the poster&#x27;s demo. The drawing is clunky, unresponsive, and looks bad. Can you imagine trying to write a note on a slide with that system?<p>Having worked on the guts of UW CP, I know that one of the hardest things was export/import from powerpoint. It is <i>very</i> hard to get right, especially with build animations. Font size 24 doesn&#x27;t export correctly in many cases. Margins and objects shift and move slightly. Exporting can be very slow -- many seconds per slide, depending on complexity. Parsing the actual pptx files and replicating the actual look without using powerpoint APIs is essentially impossible.",1452635834
10890726,comment,10886253,10887783,0,0,PopsiclePete,,,"There was a time not too long ago that nobody ever said &quot;C++ remains&quot;, what they said was &quot;Nothing can challenge C++&quot;. It was <i>the</i> &quot;business programming&quot; language. The fact that it&#x27;s now &quot;surviving&quot; and &quot;remaining&quot; is a testament to how far it&#x27;s fallen, not how successful it&#x27;s become. It didn&#x27;t rise from 0 to &quot;used&quot; over the last 5 years, that&#x27;s something a new language Go can claim with pride; no - it went from &quot;used everywhere by everyone&quot; to &quot;still used, somewhat&quot;. C is <i>still</i> more popular, at least according to TIOBE.<p>Java stole it&#x27;s crown for &quot;enterprise&quot; programming and Microsoft even pretty much abandoned it in favor of .NET. I&#x27;m not sure their massive push for &quot;C++ is back!&quot; that happened &#x27;round C++11 has really met with that much success - the world moved on, honestly.<p>There&#x27;s fewer and fewer niches for it - the web could care less for it, heavy-duty &quot;enterprise&quot; programmers aren&#x27;t giving up their safe and GC-based Java/.NET languages and giant 3rd-party eco-systems, and even video games now can be written in a higher-level language where only a small core 99% of people never interact with is in C/C++.<p>The problem is, IMO, that it&#x27;s too late for C++ to be a decent language. If the first iteration of it was C++11, then sure. But there are vast code bases out there written in the horrible mid-90&#x27;s or late 80&#x27;s dialect of C++ that aren&#x27;t going anywhere. Even something like Qt isn&#x27;t true &quot;modern&quot; C++, and don&#x27;t get me started on MFC. Look at Google&#x27;s official C++ guidelines - they <i>barely</i> allow any modern C++ into their code-base.",1452635833

My initial thinking was something like (basically): current market forces (especially in SF) favor the consolidation of ownership in the hands of the few people who can afford the large capital investment required to build new housing.<p>IOW: home prices are ridiculously high at least in part because the future value of rent extraction makes these homes good long-term investments for people who don&#x27;t live there. See also: removing units from rental for AirBnB service in the long-term (sources differ on how many units in SF are lost to permanent AirBnB hotel status, but they seem to all agree that at least <i>some</i> are off the market for this reason).<p>So, what happens if this element of the market is removed? I know, I know: it&#x27;s central to capitalism, I&#x27;m becoming a communist, etc etc. What happens when the supply - demand relationship is between residents and other residents?

Unsafe leaks into the module, <i>not</i> into the entire crate.<p>> &#x27;Just verify the unsafe blocks&#x27; is something I&#x27;ve literally heard people say.<p>Well, so did I - that&#x27;s why I wrote the post.<p>> My point is that there is at least an order of magnitude more safe code than unsafe code in an unsafe module, and I suspect it is not scrutinized nearly as much as the unsafe code.<p>I think many developers are aware that the safe code inside an &quot;unsafe module&quot; needs just as much scrutiny. The Rustonomicon documents this, now my post does, too.<p>If you used to assume that only literally those blocks need verification - yes, you underestimated the effort. I think it is still manageable though, modules (like Java classes) are kind of a unit of programming that people can get in their head &quot;as a whole&quot;. This is important not just for the safe/unsafe discussion, this is important because modules form the privacy boundary in Rust. Even when you only do safe stuff, you care about the abstraction boundary because you want to hide implementation details behind it.",1452634958

It&#x27;s to make an elevator behave <i>better</i> than they do today.<p>For example:<p>* I don&#x27;t want an elevator to close and reopen its doors on the same floor. That&#x27;s horrible user experience.<p>* All the interesting problems arise when there are multiple elevators servicing the same set of floors. So let&#x27;s control more than one elevator at the same time.<p>* If the elevator is on the ground floor, and has downward calls on both the 1st and 20th floors, then it is likely more efficient to service the 1st floor first rather than bypassing them just so you can keep travelling in the same direction.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a version of this that, rather than enforcing arbitrary rules, just has a lot of series of inputs and lets people compete to service those inputs in the shortest number of steps.",1452634922

It somehow manages to be simple and very featureful at the same time. Personally, a good chunk of my effectiveness in workings with servers and cloud provisioning can be directly attributed to it.<p>I&#x27;ve been using pre-releases of 2.0 for a few months now, mainly for its improved support for AWS services like dynamodb and IAM policies. I&#x27;ve had nothing but good experience with the new version, which cleans up the code and brings more consistency. Working with AWS, ansible shows its strengths by exposing to the developer a simplified API which gets you 95% percent of the way -- pretty much what you wish you&#x27;d get from Amazon. I feel that ansible does cloud provisioning not just easier but better than most other tools, including Amazon&#x27;s Cloud Formation.<p>Ansible&#x27;s playbooks (recipes for provisioning servers or infrastructure) read like pseudo-code, and although it&#x27;s sometime not obvious how to write an idempotent playbook for a piece of software, it is always obvious what an ansible YAML file does (despite the obvious shortcomings of YAML for this job). This is important in the devops world: all knowledge about the infrastructure is codified in version-controlled ansible code and doesn&#x27;t get lost when the job passes to a new hire.<p>This also means that you can often find a playbook for software you want to deploy already written on github (search with &quot;language:yaml&quot;).

To be honest a lot of this is still unmapped territory and I&#x27;m not even one hundred percent certain that these things are all that useful.  My main goal is to empower individuals by creating a relatively inflexible engine - that sounds weird but if you have a totally flexible content pipeline you are giving users enough rope to hang themselves.  I guess the proof of usefulness in limitation can be found in things like Minecraft - it appeals to a broad audience of not just people who want a game, but people who like to tinker.  Minecraft, by many people&#x27;s accounts, is not really a fun game, but a great sandbox.

When it comes to games, I&#x27;m just not wired right to enjoy hand-authoring content. So when I do game-like stuff, I tend to lean towards procedural generation because it lets me avoid that unpleasant task.<p>But, I&#x27;ve learned, painfully, time and time again, that that tends to be <i>way</i> harder than hand-authoring. It kind of makes sense. If hand-drawing a fun level is difficult for me to do, why should it be easier for me to write a program than can author a million of them? In some sense, the latter must be strictly harder since it is a superset of hand-authoring a few one-off things.<p>Tool-building does matter, of course. But sometimes you just gotta make some stuff.<p>Another option is to push it onto the player: make the gameplay itself creative. That can work (SimCity), but it can also fizzle out (Spore).<p>The problem there is similar, I think. With hand-authored content, you have to come up with a narrative path or maybe a tree through the possible game space that&#x27;s fun to play. With player-authored content, the <i>entire play space</i> has to be fun. Otherwise they&#x27;ll be able to make anything, but most of the stuff they make won&#x27;t be <i>fun</i> to make.",1452633616

A certain group of ideologues from a certain city all seem to have very similar style. Some people do not enjoy wasting their time reading the work of ideologues.<p>To illustrate, I&#x27;ll throw myself under the bus.<p>If I can read a summary of a book and accurately guess &quot;This came from an author based in San Francisco&quot;, I will disregard it entirely. I cannot speak for others, but I know I&#x27;m not the only one. There are a few other cities that come to mind, but SF is easily the worst offender. The most <i>extreme</i> and <i>vehement</i> bias festers in that place and it is not worth my time. The people who speak from that place are more similar to a cult-like mentality than individual or innovative thinkers. I don&#x27;t bother with listening to cults and so I don&#x27;t listen to people from SF.<p>Which is unfortunate because I am sure there are a few precious gems that don&#x27;t tow the party line who may be worth the time to read. The unfortunate bit is I don&#x27;t have the time to read <i>everything</i>. Part of my decision-making process for whether or not time should be allocated to read something involves assessing the likelihood that the author is so entrenched in their own biases as to make their work a waste of my time. Looking like an ideologue, talking an ideologue&#x27;s talking point, and coming from a place known for its ideologues are tell-tale signs for me that the person is <i>very</i> likely an ideologue.<p>I will let others risk wasting their time reading the work. If it gets enough charitable mentions from &quot;outsiders&quot; (those outside of the cult) then I may give it the time of day. Until then I will dismiss it just as some people would dismiss anything from Alex Jones and his ilk.<p>As for your last statement - there are most likely people who do. And, for what it&#x27;s worth, I didn&#x27;t.<p>(Also take my throwing myself under a bus as a separate talking point than the book recommendation you made. She is not from SF, I&#x27;m just illustrating the point about dismissing ideologues based on some small amount of known criteria.)",1452633181

That&#x27;s all it means. Saying precisely what you&#x27;re doing or what attributes your aiming for are what the formal work is all about. Whether your <i>security policy</i> is enough and your design embodies it are different things altogether.<p>&quot;what does &quot;encrypted&quot; mean? Is it just a word that you use in your specification language? if so, does it mean what you think it means? etc etc etc...&quot;<p>That&#x27;s actually one of the easiest things you could ever check in formal systems. It&#x27;s helpful to think of it like programming. Actually, done side-by-side. You implement a formal spec for a requirement and/or high-level function that takes plaintext as input and outputs ciphertext. This typically uses Red/Black separation model. You also produce and vet an implementation for the encryption module. Now, how to know if something was encrypted in the system before going on the wire? Wait for it... wait for it... answer: it went through the encryption module first while it was initialized and in a state saying it&#x27;s encrypting. Just like that. Labels and checking at interfaces were used for identifying what went with what and making policy enforcement easier.<p>Note: Guttman has a security kernel in cryptlib that does this at the interface level for every function in the system. In CompSci literature, it&#x27;s called Assured Pipelines if you want to look it up. Easier to support now with Design-by-Contract and advanced typing systems. Past systems were kludgy when they happened at OS level except with capability systems.<p>Anyway, such components and functions are composed with the interactions and compositions analyzed. Each component and composition usually has a small number of execution traces it can perform so one can brute force the analysis if necessary. Finite state machines, both success and fail states, were common in high assurance development because they can be analyzed in full in all sorts of ways.<p>Note: It was Dijkstra that invented the method for this in the THE multiprogramming system. I think PSOS did it for security first. VAX Security Kernel Retrospective has nice sections where they show layering and assurance activities plus effect they had on analysis and defect hunting.

Page 120, Section 4.5 &quot;No gratuitous incompatibilities with C&quot;.

Partial quote:<p>&quot;C++ doesn&#x27;t aim at 100% compatibility with C because that would have compromised the aims of type safety and support for design.  However, where these aims are not interfered with incompatibilities are avoided  - even at the cost of inelegance.  In most cases, C incompatibilities have been accepted only when a C rule left a gaping hole in the type system.&quot;",1452632470

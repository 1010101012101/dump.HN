With logographic systems, there is practically no connection between written symbols and their sounds. Even competent writers can know what a symbol means, but not know how to pronounce it. Or they&#x27;ll be able to use a word in speech, but not be able to write it down. The first time I saw this happen with native Mandarin speakers, I thought they were playing a joke on me.<p>The main advantage of logographic languages is written information density. If you&#x27;ve ever seen a Chinese or Japanese copy of a Harry Potter book, you&#x27;ll understand. (They&#x27;re quite thin.) Also, Twitter is a totally different experience when using hanzi or kanji. The character limit is enough for a paragraph instead of a sentence.",1453460169

The RST syntax on the forum supports the GitHub-flavored ```lang ... ``` code blocks, and many people don&#x27;t realise that.<p>Your other points are also valid.<p>But now let me give you the Nim communities perspective. Why did we decide to write our own forum? Well, for three reasons:<p>1. The old forum used phpBB which is horrible. When the Nim forum was initially written, the &quot;nice&quot; forum software didn&#x27;t exist (Discourse).<p>2. (Kind of a continuation of 1) popular forum software was always spammed to death by bots, because of the software&#x27;s popularity those bots were far more prevalent. It was our belief that a custom forum would have a lower chance of getting spam, and we are mostly right about that.<p>3. We want to test Nim. The amount of bugs that the development of the Nim Forum (as well as Jester which the forum uses) uncovered is phenomenal. The Nim forum is also a showcase of what Nim can do, and I think that&#x27;s important.<p>What I find puzzling though, is the fact that many of your points could also be said about Hacker News. Hacker News has no notifications, no friendly GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax and also has awkward little buttons (the upvote/downvote on mobile is irritating).

Because of this, the longbow could be adopted only by, or with the permission and support of, a nation’s ruler, who alone wielded the authority and resources required to undertake such e orts. Indeed, given the nature of longbow technology, to have even attempted to adopt the longbow without his ruler’s permission, a noble, for example, would have needed to successfully hide the fact that he was continuously training large numbers of archers for years—a highly improbable proposition.\nSecond, conditional on a nation’s ruler adopting longbow technology, a usurper noble with an eye on the Crown, or a prince interested in independence for his territory, could lead an effective rebellion against his ruler by supplying the inexpensive weapon to large numbers of citizens, whose ruler-sponsored training and practice with the bow had made them proficient archers. Thus, to be willing to develop longbow use in his country, a ruler had to be confident that his efforts would not be turned against him.&quot;",1453459276

It&#x27;s better to sell hardware at the price point it would be at if you are doing it large scale to test the market, even if you are selling it at a loss. However, it sounds like you are almost beyond that point and know there is a demand and at what price, but it was probably hard to compete for investment (and talent) when investors were willing to throw money at zany schemes with hopes of unicorns.  I hope for you, once investors become more careful again, that a business with something more proven and where the cash was managed sensibly will be exactly the type of company that most investors will be keen on.  This was roughly the situation after the dotcom boom, except investors were poorer and less confident (well, I hope).  I also think investors will have to increase their appetite for hardware, because IoT and autonomous vehicles are showing a lot of promise.  I also think money that would normally go to unconventional oil and gas projects would be seeking something new.  Good luck!",1453459273

It&#x27;s unfortunate that new technology will let parents hover forever.</i><p>That&#x27;s me. I &quot;stalk&quot; my children. Here&#x27;s the long story of why.<p>I live in a relatively safe area, the suburbs of Portland Oregon. There&#x27;s a fair amount of petty property crime, which tends to be tolerated if not quite condoned.<p>Fortunately the region has generally investigated violent crimes quite aggressively, and the violent crime rate is relatively low compared to many parts of the country.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t bad guys, violent sociopaths who live in the area. People like that live everywhere. E.g. here&#x27;s something horrible that happened just a few miles away to two girls, one age 12 the other age 13: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Weaver_III#Murders_of_Ashley_Pond_and_Miranda_Gaddis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Weaver_III#Murders_of_Ash...</a><p>My girls were just about that age when they got iPhones. So, I try to keep an eye on them. There&#x27;s a slight chance they&#x27;ll run into some serious danger and I might be able to help.<p>But, more realistically, it helps kids stay out of trouble, because they know there&#x27;s an increased probability that they will get caught. It&#x27;s not perfect. E.g. my older daughter was only supposed to drive my car from home to high school and back. But she chose to drive off campus at lunch. And, since she was a very inexperienced driver, she got into a car accident. So, even when she knew that dad might be stalking her, she chose to be a free spirit. That&#x27;s just how some kids are.<p>Certainly some kids will be resourceful enough to hack their phones. More power to them! But there are simpler ways. My older one simply turns off location services and then blames it on &quot;Low Power Mode&quot;.",1453458122
10951893,comment,10951545,10951545,0,0,reuven,,,"I have been learning Chinese for about 18 months. Before I started my studies, I had similar opinions to the author of this article -- that Chinese characters are antiquated, hard or impossible to learn, and a hindrance to anyone who wants to learn or use Chinese.<p>Since starting my Chinese studies, I&#x27;ve changed my mind entirely.<p>First and foremost, the characters are far from random; the system is very different than an alphabetic one, but it works -- providing the reader (or even the learner) with hints as to the meaning and pronunciation. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as you might think.  But yes, it means that if I see a character I haven&#x27;t learned before, I can be a bit stuck.  And yes, Chinese children spend lots of time learning characters in school.<p>Secondly, Chinese has a ridiculous number of homophones. Even if you take the tones into account, there are lots and lots and lots of characters that sound precisely the same when spoken.  However, they look completely different.  For example, the character 店 (for a shop) and 电 (electricity) look totally different, but sound precisely the same, diàn.   This makes understanding the language difficult (as I&#x27;m learning), but a switch to Pinyin (the Latin-character transliteration) would make the written language as ambiguous and hard to read as the spoken language is to hear.<p>Thirdly, there&#x27;s a huge amount of national pride associated with characters.  I can&#x27;t imagine telling the Chinese people, or even a subset of them, that they&#x27;ll be abandoning characters in favor of Pinyin.<p>Now, does this mean that Chinese is unlikely to overtake English as the international language of business and academia?  Yes; I think that English has firmly cemented itself in that position for a long time to come.  (I say this one day after returning from teaching a course in Brussels, where my students were from Belgium, Holland, Italy, Portugal, Germany, and Serbia... and spoke English among themselves.)  But there&#x27;s a difference between saying that English will continue to dominate in business, and saying that Chinese characters have to be tossed out.  The latter just isn&#x27;t going to happen.",1453458087

I live in the Netherlands, where we have subtitles on English shows and films, because that is much cheaper. So we&#x27;re used to English, we all speak English. We have German tv channels here as well, and especially back in the 70s and 80s, when there were only six channels on tv, that was annoying and kind of funny. Maybe Germans growing up with these German voices makes you ignorant about the fact that what you see and what you hear does not match, but for everybody else it&#x27;s absolutely clear. I see this on Spanish tv as well.<p>But I disagree with you &quot;comparable ridiculous English word&quot;. The thing is that any foreigner can read it, look it up, type it on a keyboard, and pronounce it, probably remember it with a little effort and then use it at parties or to impress people.

Surely if everyone used the same language, that would have the opposite effect and open up far more writing to more people - Chinese people could read Shakespeare. Translators would only have to convert from each old language to the lingua franca, so Hebrew speakers could read Confucius too.

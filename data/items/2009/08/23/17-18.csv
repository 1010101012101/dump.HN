Ask yourself: What's the one question you're answering for the audience so the next time they're thinking about similar stuff you, and your answer, come to mind. Then provide all relevant contact details. Be sure to save time for questions then have a few slides in your back pocket in case you have extra time. If your talk is good enough, that's your sales pitch right there. You're selling yourself through how you convey the main idea.<p>If you don't know people, conferences can be somewhat lonely. Just keep putting yourself out there. Try to arrange meetings beforehand and then try to spend meals talking with new people. Worry more about exchanging thoughts than business cards. It's easy to forget that you're there to learn. Find out when meeting people what they're learning there. It's a good opening and you'll soon find like minds.",1251049878

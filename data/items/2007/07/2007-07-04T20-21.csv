Ae you referring to the form at <a href=""http://help.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/mail/cgi_bulkmail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/mail/cgi_bulkmail</a> (This link was at bottom of the article that you gave me).

I tried to find the site with the form and some info for you, but for some reason I can't find it now. =/<p>I did come across this article that may give you some help:

What will advertising look like as video programming and advertising dollars shift to the web? Where are those advertising dollars going to go, who will decide on the content these dollars will fund, and who will provide this content?<p>I think the most important thing Garfield notes in this article is the huge shift in power has occurred with the advent of dvr and web video. People don't have to sit through flashy, in-your-face ads that shout 'buy me!.' These ads can be fast-forwarded or deleted. On the web, the attention span of the viewer is drastically reduced by the sheer volume and choice of content. Why would I watch an ad when I don't have to on this site over here? The audience is no longer captive. The student has become the teacher. We are in charge. <p>Advertising and networks are not doomed in any sense.  However, traditional, 'flashy' ads will have to be replaced by more informative, interactive, gentle, pull advertising content. Think product placement, contests, video games, informational videos... Ad content will also be interactive-the best way to extend the short-attention span of the average web user. Just because networks are reeling in costs does in no way mean that they are 'over.'  
  
Yes, traditional purveyors of advertising and large networks should be concerned, but only if they do not adapt to this huge shift in power. These networks and ad companies became successful because of innovation and I am sure they will temper the storm. However, who should be taking close note of this market shift is ambitious independent producers and content providers. There is a huge gap in the market for a few companies to sneak in and make an absolute killing. <p>To summarize: Because the viewer is in charge, ads in the future will inform rather than entertain, engage rather than impress, so really, the only question to answer is, what do the end users want to know and from whom?
I believe local expertise and endorsement to be the untapped goldmine of this 'new' advertising.",1175795954

9296,comment,9286,9286,0,0,zaidf,,,"I really don't think most of these mashups INHERENTLY will die. They might take a huge beating in how fast they grow but I think if the current mashups continue to focus on their CURRENT userbase's needs, they can turn it into a modestly profitable venture. Not everything has to return a fortune financially:)<p>I do pity the startups that raised millions and were based off of google maps. It never made sense to me but hopefully they know something I don't about their long-term strategy.<p>-Zaid",1175795597

Only if you release the node (or lose it otherwise -- it's not guaranteed to stay with you), the HD contents are lost. <p>I suspect lots of startups are finding it ""stable enough"", and the backup/redundancy planning needed manageable.",1175795420

(Mostly the same couple spammers; I don't know why they haven't banned their IPs yet).  I've been keeping showdead turned on because I'm curious about seeing how the situation evolves, but once spam reaches about double its current volume I'm going to turn it off because it'll be too annoying.<p>Edit: Maybe they've banned them now; the new queue is currently clean.",1175795409

=== The Artist ===<p>. <i>The Non-Designer's Design Book</i>, by Robin Williams.  This short, easy read details four essential design principles that will help you consciously communicate better visually.  It's also available on O'Reilly's safari service.<p>. <i>Universal Principles of Design: 100 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach Through Design</i>. This book will help you build your design vocabulary and better understand concepts in design that you likely haven't thought of.  It will help you describe the ways in which this page - <a href=""http://www.sandstromdesign.com/nav.html"">http://www.sandstromdesign.com/nav.html</a> - sucks (it lacks external consistency and it contains interference effects, to begin with).  The book has a great format, describing a topic on one page with visual examples on the following page.  The descriptions are short of enough that you can read them in about 4 minutes.<p>. <a href=""http://www.hallwaytesting.com"">http://www.hallwaytesting.com</a> - this is actually my own site.  You can post your site for usability feedback and give usability feedback.  Live usability tests allow you to get more details, but the users on my site also give valuable feedback, and it doesn't cost you any money or nearly as much time.  I try to give feedback for as many sites as possible and am usually pretty thorough about it. Users have told me that the site has helped them a lot.<p>
=== The Seller ===<p>. <a href=""http://www.marketingexperiments.com"">http://www.marketingexperiments.com</a> . This site is absolutely the best web development resource I've found, ever.  It contains articles on developing a unique value proposition, doing competitive analysis on the Internet, and of course actually marketing your site using PPC, SEO, and other online marketing techniques.  Perhaps the most valuable thing I learned from this site is that online marketing <i>is</i> online testing.<p>. <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>, by Dale Carnegie.  For a long time I didn't want to read this book because I thought doing so would make me a sleaze ball.  Instead it's made me a more effective communicator.  When you think about it, honing our skills in most areas involves learning how to communicate with other humans better.  As The Tech Wizard it's essential that you communicate the purpose of your code.   As The Artist it's essential you communicate the purpose of a site and each of its elements.  As The Seller you must know how to communicate value.  Dale Carnegie's book will show you how to effectively communicate value.

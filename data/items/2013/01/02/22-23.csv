4999865,comment,4999406,4999778,1,0,elbear,,,"Well, the Django ORM also allows you to write SQL by hand and if you make a mistake you can fall pray to SQL injection, so I'm assuming that there's something different about this exploit. From what I understand the current issue appears because the person who implemented the faulty method uses SQL directly and doesn't pass the parameters separately.<p>In Python, you would do something like this:<p><pre><code>    execute('select name, age from employees where id=?', (params['id'],))\n</code></pre>\nThis passes the id as the second argument to the execute function. If you do this, on the other hand, you open yourself to SQL injection, because %s is replaced with params[id] and no escaping is done:<p><pre><code>    execute('select name, age from employees where id=%s' % params['id'])</code></pre>",1357167476

I would prefer it if the author said why he cared. By that statement I mean Microsoft mail fail, they may not. Steve may leave, he may not. Technology will change. But unless you're long on Microsoft in the market I'm not sure why you would invest so much time disparaging Ballmer.<p>Microsoft is a big place, it may land in the toilet it may not. I watched Sun fall from being the #1 server company in the world to an acquistion for a software product. Does it matter that they didn't make the right moves once the server market shifted? Wasn't it even possible?<p>""Confronting Reality"" [1] is a good, although somewhat depressing, book about how organizations resist seeing things they don't want to see. As a companion to ""Execution"" (also by Bossidy) I think folks who want to manage companies should read both.<p>The key point in Confronting Reality is that even when ""you"" see things clearly, you are but one pixel of an image sensor of potentially damaged pixels. As a leader you have to understand how people become afraid of seeing an unpleasant reality and then just simply do not see it, like your eye doesn't see the big opaque circle in the middle of your vision.<p>Microsoft's world changed, the successful people got promoted but the stuff they were successful at became irrelevant. If they started again on their same project from the same place they would not be successful now. But that doesn't change the fact that they <i>were</i> successful and now they are calling the shots at some elevated place in the organization. There are so many things that shape an organization, some can be changed, some cannot.<p>I don't know if Microsoft will survive. I know they are not having the impact in the market they would like, but I'm not sure they know what market they are in. They need a mission, which is something Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple have but Microsoft does not. At least not obviously. No mission, no market, no way to measure your effectiveness.

For everything. $40.<p>I was chided for suggesting that Microsoft leave Windows Desktop behind a couple of days ago, but I can't see any long-term future for it with consumers. Microsoft would do better by spinning off Entertainment & Devices into a new company, and having Microsoft solely focus on the enterprise customer where crazy pricing and naming and options for <i>everything</i> is commonplace.<p>That these two were so entwined in the first place was the idea that consumers want to use what they use at work, and vice versa. This worked, until consumers said ""Actually, we all want iPads"" and Microsoft is far too late to that game. Consumers aren't in a symbiotic relationship with what they use at work anymore.",1357166903

4999816,comment,4999528,4999528,4,0,binarycrusader,,,"Personally, I believe part of the problem is the artificial barriers to platform adoption that Microsoft continues to insist upon.  For example, Windows Phone 8 is basically a good platform.  But there's no support for OpenGL -- the graphics interface of choice in the mobile world today.  If they wanted more ""apps"" (games) for the platform, then choosing to support OpenGL would have been a sign they actually care about that.<p>There's also a bit of ""not invented here"" going on.  They could have embraced and contributed to webkit, and made the web better for everyone, instead they wasted millions of dollars recreating what someone else had already done in IE10 and then limited IE10 to the newest of platforms.  While I'm not suggesting that they slavishly follow what everyone else does with webkit, they could have at least used it as a base and contributed meaningful changes back.<p>And finally, yes, as a Windows 8 user myself, I can tell you that while the underlying OS is clearly loads better, the Modern UI is a mishmash of UI ideas with razor-sharp usability edges.",1357166844

This is typically solved by using parametric, prepared statements. Basically, you prepare a SQL statement that contains ""?"" for the parameter values and then bind values to the statement.<p>2) (Common in ORM frameworks) A user provided string is used to compose some other (non-parameter) piece of the SQL statement, such as a column or table name. This is usually caused by laziness. Rather than combining the string provided by the user (form values, URL components, etc.) you should instead look up the string to use from some internal data source, such as a list of domain classes, etc., and use that instead. In that way, the data that is user provided is kept entirely separate from data that will be executed.<p>You'll hear a lot of people talk about ""why isn't this being escaped"". And, frankly, it's a good question. But the real question is ""why are you trusting data that could come from anywhere on earth?"". Don't take it for granted that only your users will be sending queries to your application.<p>The code you write for Django (Post.objects.get(pk=request.GET['id']) is only secure from 1 and 2 if the framework is written in an appropriate manner to avoid trusting user provided data.<p>The fact that this keeps happening on Rails is the #1 reason I haven't bothered to take the time to do anything real with it. I don't have the time to read the code for the framework and I don't trust that it's written with security in mind.<p>ps.

It's to be expected that weekends or special events affect availability. But there are <i>so</i> many lots around its easy to walk an extra block.<p>I've been in 2 accidents in their cars. First time was pretty bad, 2nd one was minor. Each time the most I had to pay was a $500 deductible. That sucked, but was <i>nothing</i> compared to how much I had to pay for an accident many years ago in my own car. (This all makes me sound like a terrifyingly bad driver, but I'm not!)<p>Just in the last 2 days I used Zipcar. I was heading to Stinson Beach for New Years. To rent the car overnight was $101. It was 2 blocks away.<p>I called Enterprise downtown and got quoted a car at $28/day. Awesome, I think. Well, no. They closed at 3pm that day. And they're downtown. And although I only needed the car for 1 day, they were closed on Jan 1 and would have cost me $45 to drop the car off when the place is closed. So then I would have bad to worry about parking a car I didn't need. Also, since I refuse to carry a credit card, in order to use my standard bank card (the thing that has all the money I actually have, and not artificial debt like in a CC), they want <i>paper</i> copies of two bills to my house and my last pay stub. Seriously? I don't get paper <i>anything</i> anymore, much less a pay stub.<p>So in the end, I payed a little more for the Zipcar rental. I got the convenience of it being local, flexible, and less shit for me to worry about. That's why I like Zipcar.<p>I've had the occasional frustration with them. Dirty car, no gas, broken card. Little infrequent things that are frustrating at the time but are rare. You call and report the previous driver, they get fined and don't so it again. It's happened to me a couple times.<p>So I refute your claims about Zipcar being so bad. I've used them a lot longer and quite happily too.

As for consulting, I have had some really awful experiences and some really good ones.... \nHere are some tips that might help you with your 2013 goal to consult more..\n1. Unless its an established client, take at least a 10-20% fee up-front once you and the client AGREE ( as in, they agree in writing by email or on paper ) on the requirements.\n2. Then take 50% of the balance upon demo when the client agrees that the app is up to their liking followed by the remaning 50% on app launch.<p>Of course, you can vary the percentages to you liking but this  has worked great for me so far...<p>Where I went wrong was being too eager to get the business and getting started on a project without getting any money upfront.<p>If they are serious about the project and generally a professional entity ( person/business ) they will pay upfront..otherwise run like hell.<p>You will obviously make a few mistakes along the way but you will get the idea of filtering clients the more you consult.<p>Some clients can be more demanding than the others, but in general as long as they are paying, you will be alright!<p>Good luck and thanks for the great post!",1357164332

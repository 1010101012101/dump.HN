41304,comment,41065,41065,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Good luck. I guess...how do I say this? There are some aspects to this that you're either missing or not highlighting.<p>First, this page:<p><a href=""http://micropledge.com/help"" rel=""nofollow"">http://micropledge.com/help</a><p>SHOULD explain exactly who owns what when software is made. Do the pledgers have any ownership? Just the coders? Do you force coders to use GPL? I'm sure you explain this somewhere, but it needs to be more clear, and I'm not going to do a lot of research...<p>Anyway. More importantly...Software, as soon as you leave the YC forcefield [1], is extremely expensive to produce. My company's tiny projects are billed in the upper 6-figure range. Are you going to get anyone ""pledging"" USD 750,000 for anything non-trivial? <p>[1] Remember that the 15,000 dollars or whatever YC gives people is just a token, maybe just a legal formality, to ensure their status as ""investors"". What they really give is exposure and advice and community. If you can get people pledging 15K, it still isn't enough.",1186768992

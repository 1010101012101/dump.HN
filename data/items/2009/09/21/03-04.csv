833964,comment,833635,833780,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'd disagree with this, but I do think it's important to understand the limitation of what you can learn in a corporate environment.<p>My path was the opposite of many people: I worked for 2 startups, founded one, am now working for a big company, and hope there's another startup in my future.  Google was the first company I've worked where I <i>didn't</i> have to set up the build system.  And naturally, Google's build system is better than anything I've ever set up.<p>When you work for a big company, you get to draw on the accumulated wisdom of thousands of people that have come before you.  A lot of things that seem obvious once you've looked at them - like how to organize your code, or how to design C++ programs with clear object ownership, or how to unit test libraries with lots of dependencies - require lots of laborious trial and error to get right before yourself.  Many startups are filled with people that are fairly new to programming (because that's all they can get) and don't have that experience.  You can easily go through several jobs thinking that SourceSafe and zip files count as a version control system, it's normal for functions to be 400 lines long, and deployment consists of FTPing a JARfile to the production servers.<p>The weakness in big companies is that you don't see all the false steps that led to these ""best practices"" being instituted.  So you might leave and found a startup thinking that you absolutely must have 100% unit test coverage for everything, because that's the way things were in your 100+ person division in the old company.  Or you might go too far in the other direction, and think that you don't have time to setup a decent build system.  It takes experience - in both environments that have them and those that don't - to understand the particular circumstances where ""best practices"" are really best practices.<p>IMHO, the ideal career setup for founding a startup is to intern at startups in high school & college, then work for a fast grower or big company for a couple years afterwards.  (And start lots of little companies while you're in classes, of course. ;-))  Startups typically demand more from interns than big companies do, because there's more to do, and you also get to see firsthand all the problems caused by inadequate development practices.  And then you can see things done right at a big company, with enough time to actually dive into the meat of it.  You still probably won't succeed with your first company (almost nobody does), but at least this'll expose you to what both success and failure looks like.",1253505216

Even then, there is some finite limit as to how many bits can be transferred. How do we handle scalability beyond it then? By abstraction. Rather than sending raw data we only send what is relevant & decode it at either ends.<p>Now transactions are raw data that flows in the bitcoin network, but there will always remain a practical limit. Throughput of the network is number of transactions per unit of time it can handle, which translates to number of blocks per unit of time.<p>To increase the value of this equation, 3 things can be done: 1.increase block size 2.Decrease block time 3.Abstraction<p>The problem is that XT side considers increasing blocksize is the only way. The core side has presented sidechains as one of the methods of abstraction, but since they invented it they formed a company out of it and now it appears as conflict of interest. Anyways, XT side is painting the Core side as anti scaling, which is totally untrue, but since sidechains are not even being heard, they are inviting other proposals to be presented at the workshop in Montreal on 12th Sept.",1440589782

Apple will continue to make more money from the iPhone and iPad than many entire countries&#x27; GDP, patents or no patents.  They don&#x27;t need any additional artificial &quot;incentives.&quot;<p>Another reason is to reward those who finance expensive long-term R&D efforts.

10122175,comment,10120986,10122022,0,0,viraptor,,,">  But if you are actually concerned about the identity of the person, passport numbers, etc are better uids.<p>Why not just name + email? I don&#x27;t think putting anything like a passport number is a wise idea. It&#x27;s just putting one more semi-secret information on the internet.<p>I think the encryption and signing+trust gets mixed here. If I know someone only by email address, I don&#x27;t trust their key very much. But I&#x27;m still going to use it to encrypt messages to them, because it&#x27;s better than nothing. I&#x27;m going to trust it if it&#x27;s got a track record of reasonable messages on mailing lists or git commits over some period of time.<p>But back to the main topic: email-only, and passport number are two extremes and the second one is even hard to verify. Most people actually just use name+email combination in uids. And that&#x27;s what gpg invites you to do when generating keys. Why didn&#x27;t you mention it?",1440587654

For larger structural changes, however, I&#x27;ve found core.typed has paid off. Obviously some people have a visceral reaction to type systems, but even if you don&#x27;t use it at the outset, the ability to gradually add type information to existing code is great for paving the way for larger refactorings.<p>The workflow I have grown to love in clojure is an initial freewheeling, REPL-driven, dynamically typed phase in which you explore the problem you&#x27;re working on, followed by a period of stabilisation that results in nicely factored, mostly-typed code.

The programs are so new and rudimentary, the universities don&#x27;t really even know what to teach the students in an &quot;Intro to Data Science&quot; class. But it&#x27;s a buzzword in the media, and there&#x27;s employer demand now, so I think that universities saw the $$$ and just ran with it.<p>It&#x27;s really more of a technical skillset and toolset for statisticians and other actual scientists who use statistics to test their hypotheses. Make Intro CS, Relational Algebra and Set Theory, and Computational Statistics electives for Bachelor of Science degrees. This really doesn&#x27;t need its own degree program, and neither did &quot;business intelligence&quot; back when that was the buzzword for this.

Jenkins took me less than a day to set up (as someone who had never set it up before), and while it wasn&#x27;t all smooth sailing, everyone was capable of diagnosing problems that we encountered.<p>To be fair to both Circle and Jenkins, between Github, Heroku and/or <insert other virtual services here>, there are a lot of &#x27;black boxes&#x27; that have to work in concert (for us, and probably for many others out here).

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don&#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I&#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside 
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.
  
  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit 
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a World Class bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43
  
  - If youre renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.
  
  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youve used a lot of technologies, but youre not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

He&#x27;s been wildly successful with data science despite not having a deep academic background, which is not the common case. His story is a useful data point though.<p>Do you need multiple degrees to master data science? Hell no. The practice of statistical inference requires only a few key skills. The important part is understanding how to think in terms of probability and algorithms, which doesn&#x27;t require a rigorous understanding of proofs and formulae. An advanced academic degree is useful but not required. The world is looking for people who can consistently get the right answer, regardless of their background.<p>The other side to this is that a degree will be required to work for wall st, google, harvard, etc. Degrees still matter and social signalling and so on and so forth. We all can&#x27;t be as well known and popular as Nate Silver and at some point institutions need a way of establishing that a particular candidate is truly qualified. So if you&#x27;re not a messianic ml rock star, sweating the degree might be a good idea.<p>The beauty of a purely empirical craft is that results are the only arbiter of success. Anyone can get the right answer. It might be awhile before society catches up to and utilizes this powerful idea, but the hiring competitions on sites like kaggle are a great start [1]. Until then the best case is being the next Nate Silver.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extr...</a>",1380634733

 I will admit I was quickly lost while trying to read this chest beating bravado manifesto mixed (strangely enough) with a lack of self confidence oozing from every other sentence. You know what impresses hackers? Code, quality code that does something non trivial. In academia either no one pays attention to your work and you can think it&#x27;s great without anyone arguing with you, or they try to tear something truly novel apart like a pack of rabid hyena. When you get on the front page of hacker news some people are going to do the same thing. Think of it as publishing a ground breaking paper. Programmers can be rather laconic, and if this means using a short sentence to let you know you aren&#x27;t explaining your product/project succinctly enough, or you are requiring to many clicks just to get to the meat of what you want to tell people perhaps it&#x27;s good advice and you should take it (along with a grain of salt because SOME people are just assholes but assholes rarely give actionable valuable feedback) especially if it&#x27;s multiple people.",1380633669

The size of 8 bytes had been chosen because it was small enough to allow a large number of allocation to be performed so that timing were quite accurate in the results, however the main goal was to show the difference between was are called the &quot;contended&quot; and the &quot;uncontended&quot; case: your program may perform properly with single-threaded workload, but poorly in a multi-threaded environment, not because of explicit locking in your code but because some resource sharing is hidden behind the allocator.<p>Also, the choice of lot of allocations + lot of deallocations pattern was chosen because this is an issue we ran into quite recently: we allocated a huge tree structure progressively and sometimes we flushed it to disk. The flush was quite efficient, but the deallocation blocked the program during approximatively 30s. As a quick fix, we put the deallocation in background, but this slowed the tree construction down by approximatively 50% because of the contention of the allocator. Even if the size of the chunks in the article were not realistic, the results were near-realistic enough to be considered publishable.<p>I provided (in a separate comment) the result of the benchmarks with a 32-bytes payload (in that benchmark, all the allocators had the same 12% overhead in term of memory, but we clearly see the same performance pattern as with the 8-bytes payload).",1380632850

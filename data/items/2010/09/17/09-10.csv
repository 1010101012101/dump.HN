My dad was (still is, in fact) working in the computing department at a university all those years ago and managed to get us all kinds of nice little extras.<p>Like duel floppy drives - no tapes for me! And I didn't even realise how lucky I was until I visited a friend and we spend 20 minutes loading a game from tape. And visited another friend who saved some of his work to tape, only for the tape to get corrupted somehow, so it never loaded again.<p>Like sideways RAM. I always thought it was called this because it plugged sideways into the motherboard, but apparent this is not so: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideways_address_space"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideways_address_space</a>. This supported an extra 16kB (I think) of memory, and allowed us to run a complete word processor, and my dad used a Pascal compiler - which took up to half an hour to compile his code! I remember him setting it going over dinner... But it used to die on the first compile error found, which did tend to slow things down even more. And we had a daisy-wheel printer, which gave fantastic quality so long as you only required one font at a single size.<p>Then, a couple of years later, we got a 6502 co-processor connected via the 'tube' (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_%28BBC_Micro%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_%28BBC_Micro%29</a>) - an expansion port on the BBC micro. This more than doubled the memory, and ran faster. But various optimizations didn't work. You could no longer write directly to screen address-space, as this was still in the hosts address-space, whereas user programs now executed in the co-processors address space.\nBut, excitingly, there were API calls that allowed you to read/write to/from memory in the host system, so I wrote a (very simple) windowing system that stored the graphics contents beneath each window in the host memory, while executing on the co-processor.<p>The most ambitious programme I ever wrote was a sideways scrolling shooter game, which was written almost entirely in assembly, and could have up to 50 moving sprites on the screen at the same time without dropping frame-rate. Sadly I never fully completed it, as my dad had just got his first PC at the time and I moved over fairly quickly.<p>And of course, no discussion of the BBC is complete without mentioning Elite, which was a truely awesome game. They completely re-implemented line drawing routines, as the inbuilt ones weren't fast enough. And they used two screen modes _at the same time_ to allow high definition at the top of the screen, but only in black and white; and lower definition, but in colour, at the bottom of the screen. Try doing _that_ on a PC!<p>Sigh... Wonderful times... And all in less than 32kB of memory...",1284716864

Microsoft completely killed them off with NT Server and then Active Directory with Win2k. We had around 50 clients running Netware, and within 12 months of Active Directory being released, we had switched almsot all of them over to Windows (usually with Linux servers alongside for web stuff).<p>Some customers were so desperate to move over that we actually installed and rolled out preview releases of Win2k - since it allowed them to manage their network using the GUI and it was a total cost reduction.<p>Novell simply never responded. They were still stuck on DOS when Win2k provided a familiar GUI and much easier management. In our bespoke rollouts, even we recognized that Win2k wasn't the best at everything, which is why we would almost install some Linux or BSD servers as well (with Samba) (we did so much of these hybrid installs that I ended up writing NDS drivers for Squid, Apache and a bunch of other open source apps - I think that same code is still being used today). Running Windows also meant that you had one unifying network protocol - TCP/IP, instead of IPX/SPX on the network and TCP/IP on the outside.<p>RFP's from government and large corporations flooded out with requests for Windows rollouts to replace Netware. It was amazing how quickly this happen. A lot of consultants made a lot of bank at that time ripping Novell out of the enterprise and replacing it with Windows, and often Linux as well.<p>By the time Novell picked up SuSE, it was too late - they had blown the massive lead they had in the enterprise server market and never regained it.

Normally entrepreneurs and CEOs round here write a short note that they are the founder or CEO or whatever. I didn't put 2 and 2 together. Mae Culpa. But do I now have to double check every submission? Wouldn't it be ""normal"" to say that you're affiliated if you're affiliated. My hunch says yes.<p>Personally, I don't think it's ok that a CEO posts here for financial gain - I don't like that motive and I don't like in what direction it would take this site. I feel like this site is like a tech-news link aggregator with a entrepeneurial spin. I don't think it should be used by established businesses to boost traffic. Yes haveing a CEO of any company is of value to the community but only if they are here on merit, and not if they try to manipulate the community.<p>Like I have said again and again, it is neither here nor there if I agree or disagree with the article - the discussion I want to have is that I think this one: this guy when he submits 2 posts (written by himself on a corporate blog!) one day after another on topics that are guaranteed to cause a stir is cynically trying to boost traffic plain and simple. I don't want up-votes, I just think it speaks of the mob mentality and group-think on HN that you can't dissent or point something out like this without being down-modded.<p>I am taking it is. Thanks for taking so much time to respond. I hope you see my point of view. I don't see why I keep getting down-modded for it. You seem reasonable and if you say you feel this kind of thing is fine then I'll certainly take you opinion into account and I feel like you're the type of person who would extend me the same courtesy.<p>Phew!",1284715793

However, I think the Principle of Charity applies here—Apple <i>generally</i> employs good engineers, and they got everything <i>else</i> native-ized, standardized, POSIXized, etc. for 10.0. There must have been a particular reason for iTunes being the one thing that got left out of HIG-ification in 10.0 <i>and every update since</i>, and I propose that that particular reason is Windows support.<p>Yes, Windows does have hooks to add functionality—but hooks aren't enough. The reason Apple could remove components from iTunes was that it could, itself, integrate them into all shipping copies of OSX. Apple doesn't decide what drivers and plug-ins get shipped with Windows, so anything they'd install would be third-party and after-the-fact (which is what already happens: e.g. the CD burner driver bundled into the Windows iTunes installer.) You can't slim down Windows iTunes because you have to ship all the programs that make up the functionality of iTunes, whether modularly or monolithically. However, you <i>can</i> slim down OSX iTunes if you just start saying ""this will be an OS feature, not an iTunes feature.""<p>Also, on a completely unrelated note:<p>>  The phone almost gets it right except for the gratuitous password nag.<p>I've always taken that to be a sudo escalation prompt.

Similarly I do not find that this article contains good or valuable info, it's just zeitgeisty and filled with folksy homespun truths.

You want to short-circuit combine two (or more) values, returning the first one that is valid, without evaluating the later ones.<p>You need a type that represents a possibly-unavailable value. ""Boolean"" is not that type. ""Maybe"" is Haskell's type-safe ""Nullable"" type. It has two kinds of values: ""Nothing"" or ""Just a"", where ""a"" is a value of any type.<p>Some quick simplified definitions of Haskell terms:
""Control.Monad"" is Haskell's generalization of ""flow control""
""mplus"" is Haskell's generalization of ""or"" (as it means in Perl/Python).<p>backticks are used to make a regular prefix function into an infix operator.<p>""undefined"" is like Perl's ""die"" or Java's uncatchable Exception, used here to show where short-circuit happens.<p>ghci is a Haskell interpreter.<p><pre><code>  % ghci

  *** Exception: Prelude.undefined

  > Just 1 `mplus` undefined

2634200,comment,2632510,2633800,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"Ok, so as the client processes more requests with the server the resource use increases, so in theory the higher the benchmark numbers the faster the server would actually respond without the extra load of the client. So (in theory) the server with the highest performance actually performs better than perceived (assuming that the tester is hitting resource bottlenecks somewhere on his server during the test, which isn't shown).<p>Luckily this benchmark is incredibly simple. It's not a complex system as the test is using a single set of data with two pieces of software in a single contained environment; the only thing that changes is one piece of software and one configuration: the server. Separate the server/client and your test is still the same, only with extra resources for the server and client to take advantage of (and less network bandwidth and higher latency). Knowing how http clients work, and knowing how http servers work, is it possible that the client or server could be utilizing resources in such a different way after being separated as to skew the results in a significant way?<p>I don't believe so. Even if you saturated a 1Gbps network link, you will see differences in CPU time between processing of requests and differences in memory use, and unless they are all fast enough to saturate that link you will see some servers process more requests than others. If you want to verify this you can follow the benchmark's set-up and try on two separate machines and let us know if there's a significant difference.",1307555620

The short-method school of OO came from the Smalltalk world. It has since been extrapolated to other languages. I am skeptical of this extrapolation. It's fashionable to say language choice doesn't matter that much, but I think language choice has a powerful effect in conditioning how one thinks about one's program. Different languages give rise to different ideas, and ultimately very different programs. It wouldn't surprise me if the short-method style makes good sense in Smalltalk environments for reasons that don't naively extrapolate to other languages. But that's just a guess.<p>By the way, the reason the above language effect doesn't get discussed is that when we compare languages we're almost always talking about already-existing code (look at how you can write X in Haskell or whatever). This leaves out the most important factor, which is how the language affects the creation of X in the first place.",1307553943

I agree, both about the short methods school and about programming dogmas in general.<p>I went through a couple years of working in the OO short method style. Recently an old client called me back to help modify some code I'd done for them in 2004, so I went down for an afternoon to help them out. I was really embarrassed. It was obvious to me that I had strung things together in endless chains of delegation (tiny classes and short methods) not because that was simple but because it, at the time, was my belief about programming. I got that belief from other programmers I admired.<p>The truth is that this is how most of us work all the time. I don't mean short methods; I mean picking a style based on our beliefs -- mostly for emotional reasons -- and then seeing the entire programming world through that filter. To be able to just <i>see</i> the problem is difficult when you're operating from one of these positions. Much (most?) of what we do in software development is add extrinsic complexity, which is bad when the problems themselves are hard to begin with.<p>My experience is that your moment of ""the problem itself is actually very simple if you approach it in the right way"" does eventually come, if you make getting there a high priority. But it's challenging. Most of the time we don't even know what our assumptions and beliefs are, let alone have the flexibility to adapt them to the problem. It's usually the other way around: we adapt the problem to our beliefs because they determine how we even see the problem in the first place.",1307552947

How many small static files you can serve per second is just one (not very important) criteria when choosing one of these servers.<p>I think more important criteria are:<p>1. Stability.  How often are you woken up in the middle of the night because your web server is shitting the bed.<p>2. Configuration.  Can you configure it to do all the things you will need it to do?  Have others who have come before you been happy with it throughout the entire life of their product, or have they outgrown it?<p>3. Simplicity.  Can you set it up to run efficiently without weeks of study on how this server is properly deployed?  Is it easy to mess up the configuration and take your site down when making a change?<p>4. Generality.  Are you going to need something else to sit in front of your dynamic pages, if you require them?  This is also a factor in stability, if you have 2 server solutions, all else being held constant, that is twice as likely to break down or get broken during a configuration change as just one.  Actually, it is much more than twice as likely, since you are spreading your competency to learn the ins and outs of 2 pieces of software, so you are less capable on each than you would have been if you just had one server solution to worry about.<p>So, given all this, my advice to anyone trying to make an initial decision on what webserver to use is: (Apache|nginx) (pick one only) should be your default until you believe you have a compelling <i>reason</i> to use something else.  Both are capable of doing more or less everything you need, have lots of extensions, are widely used, and have comprehensible configuration.

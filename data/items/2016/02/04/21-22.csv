Though for most games, everything not tied to the player really can just be its literal location.  It&#x27;s crucial that these directories have a mix of models, textures, and whatever else you need, instead of a mass of parallel structures.<p>If there are automated tools, they should run on the entire asset directory and dump to a new directory in whatever hierarchy makes sense to the tool. When that turns out to be slow, check &quot;file modified&quot; timestamps in the tool instead of dumping required knowledge on the artist.<p>Getting artists to actually use source code control instead of having personal folders full of things like rock01_retouched_new_final_final.3ds is a bit of a pipedream, but you can at least put the asset directory under source control and make that the only way to see things in the engine.",1454623181

Do people really keep a policy of &quot;every branch must pass CI&quot; ?<p>I like rebase on my branches so I merge as a single commit at the head of the branch I am merging into, but rebasing a shared branch is total ick.<p>As for needing every branch to pass CI forever to use git bisect.. that seems a bit extreme. I think I have used git bisect like 3 times in the past 5 years?  And each time I wrote a very simple unit test and fed it into git bisect and was able to figure it out without a problem. If you are using git bisect constantly I guess I can see, but that has another smell. Who cares when it was broke, just fix the broke thing!!",1454623116

I worked with C++ for 10 years, on mostly server side software, and never encountered a problem that we traced back to heap fragmentation.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly why this was the case... perhaps the use of object pools prevented it, or perhaps it just isn&#x27;t that big of a problem on modern 64 bit servers.<p>At Cloudera, we still mostly use CMS because the version of G1 shipped in JDK6 wasn&#x27;t considered mature, and we only recently upgraded to JDK7.  We are currently looking into defaulting to G1, but it will take time to feel confident about that.  G1 is not a silver bullet anyway.  You can still get multi-minute pauses with heaps bigger than 100GB.  A stop-the-world GC is still lurking in wait if certain conditions are met, and some workloads always trigger it... like starting the HDFS NameNode.",1454623089

My father works construction and between the UCC being dozens of chapters long and every municipality having its own grandfathered in or exceptional bullshit make breaking ground a minefield of bureaucratic nightmare.<p>In hindsight, I wish we could have produced third party unaffiliated review boards for new construction so that builders could get their blueprints and finish products certified. We could have had an industry of competitive certification processes directed towards homebuilding, and the most trustworthy and reliable certifications would have gained name recognition builders would desire for well built property. Then we could avoid this entire trainwreck of bureaucracy, but understandably volunteer certification doesn&#x27;t help the poverty stricken when being offered a &quot;cannot be beat&quot; deal on a derelict unsafe house, which is the root problem in all this.

I find out when they fail and someone, usually customer service, complains.<p>If the server goes away, then even once I redeploy, I&#x27;ve lost all those cron jobs. Who knows what will happen then.<p>On systems I build, cron jobs are added as part of the deployment process and managed as code, in the git repository.<p>That&#x27;s just one example. Others include iptables rules, FTP server configuration, startup scripts, and such. If it&#x27;s not in your codebase, it&#x27;s unmanaged state on the server that you will lose if your cloud provider takes a shit. All of that needs to be managed as code or as configuration and deploy scripts should contain idempotent commands that add them if they are not present. I consider shelling into a server for any reason to be unideal and will think of ways to avoid it.<p>If you are asking about database being on the same server as the application, it&#x27;s because it makes infrastructure management more difficult. Application servers are set up quickly, torn down quickly, and work as soon as you deploy. Database servers are fortresses, you don&#x27;t build new ones and tear them down half as quickly, unless you&#x27;ve got scaling requirements.<p>It is tempting to want to put data on the same server as the application early on in order to save on hosting costs, with the understanding that you&#x27;ll separate them later, but that&#x27;s a rookie move.

Partly because FAA certification requirements make it prohibitively expensive to develop software or electronics that go into certified aircraft.

Sometimes the government protecting us from small risks exposes us to much bigger ones.<p>(I agree that Apple&#x27;s cash hoard does not make $1M sound like a lot, however, they also have much more software to tend to.) Overall, it seems that today you have to trade correctness for features and development time, and the cost in features and development time cannot be borne by a market participant unless the market is regulated so that all competitors have to do it, in which case the user is going to get way, way less functionality. I believe that the cost of bulletproof correctness might drop significantly enough at some point to change the game - and I really, really hope formal methods will take off big time, without being sure they can - but it doesn&#x27;t seem like we&#x27;re there yet.

It gets added to a lot of stuff (after extracting it from wheat of course), usually to make it stickier, so it&#x27;s used a lot in baked goods, pastries, etc.<p>The problem with it is that a small but significant portion of the population either allergies or sensitivities to it, so it&#x27;s best that they avoid eating it.  The rest of us don&#x27;t have that problem.  But those that do look for alternatives, leading to the rise of &quot;gluten-free&quot; foods today.  Traditionally, making GF alternatives has been difficult because the gluten is what helps stuff stick together, so GF bread for instance ended up being hard and very brittle, not chewy like normal bread.  But GF stuff has gotten better; I think Xanthan gum is a popular gluten substitute in such foods to give the same effect.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m usually pretty well-aware of pseudoscience regarding stuff like this, &quot;chemicals&quot; in foods, etc., and I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone thinking gluten is an artificial chemical.  The GF faddists (the ones who don&#x27;t have a genuine allergy or sensitivity) usually just think that GF foods are somehow &quot;healthier&quot;, though they have absolutely nothing to base this opinion on.  However, it&#x27;s not all bad: because of all these GF faddists, there&#x27;s a much, much bigger market for GF foods now than there used to be, so people who are genuinely gluten-intolerant now have far more options than they used to.  Just 5 years ago, such a person couldn&#x27;t eat anything from, say, Domino&#x27;s Pizza if their buddies were ordering from there, but now they can since Domino&#x27;s has a GF pizza option.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s plenty of foods which are perfectly natural, yet some people can&#x27;t eat them because they have allergies to them.  I believe some people are allergic to shellfish, for instance.  And of course, peanuts are a well-known food allergy; they can outright kill people in small doses, even though there&#x27;s nothing artificial about a peanut.  And don&#x27;t forget the absolute poisons out there like hemlock, ricin, etc.  Those are all-natural too.  Even apple seeds have small amounts of poison in them.",1454620896

I met a person whose first job out of college was VP of Engineering for a 4 person company which he used to convince a 10 person company to hire him as their VP Eng, which he used a 20 person company to hire him as their VP Eng, up the line until he was hired by a 1500 person company as their VP Eng where he was fired shortly after being hired.

There&#x27;ve been periods where it seemed that there were a large number of new technologies being promoted -- OLE, SOAP, and XML were several of the big ones, with a burst seeming to emerge just as the first dot-com bubble shattered.  I still recall walking into a (now closed, of course) technical bookstore in a tech hub, and finding an O&#x27;Reilly title I hadn&#x27;t seen before, with the blurb &quot;The only book on $TECHNOLOGY_X you&#x27;ll ever need&quot;.  I did my standard scan:  title page, contents, introduction, index.<p>I never got the least idea of what $TECHNOLOGY_X was.<p>That said, the blurb was accurate -- it was the only book I&#x27;d ever need, it only neglected to consider that I never needed it.<p>For young techies <i>who happened to cut their teeth on a skillset that is widely adopted by the industry</i>, the world is your oyster.  Eventually, that skillset erodes or is abandoned.  I watched that happen to mainframe and VMS programmers, to Perl hackers, to various all-inclusive toolkits aimed at what were once called &quot;Open Systems&quot; (apparently nobody wanted to say &quot;Unix&quot;).  And many Microsoft technologies (though some have been surprisingly robust).<p>I&#x27;m watching it now with the set of Web technologies that have emerged post-2005.  For many HN readers, Rails, Ajax, Angular, etc., are all you&#x27;ve ever known.  For others, they&#x27;re one more set of word-and-TLA-salad tossed out in front of us.<p>When I cared to do so, I&#x27;d learn the technologies in front of me, well, and try to keep an eye on what&#x27;s coming down the pipe.  But with tech half-lives measured in single-digit years, if not months, that&#x27;s increasingly difficult.  And frankly, the results are also increasingly difficult to deal with.<p>I see a recaptitulation coming, almost certainly with a vast simplification.  I strongly suspect that someone&#x27;s going to look up from Node.js-SOAP-COBOL one day and realise that they&#x27;re accomplishing nothing Codd, Englebert, or Ritchie didn&#x27;t pressage decades ago.<p>We&#x27;ll get a simple document format.  Probably based on HTML or LaTeX.  We&#x27;ll get an applications platform.  Commerce will be standardised to a small set of apps, almost certainly growing out of iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, eBay, or Craigslist, or someone taking on one of their positions.  Media will get its own dedicated standalone player.<p>And the titles &quot;Web Designer&quot; and &quot;Web Applications Engineer&quot; will be consigned to the same Schumpeterian scrap-heap of history as &quot;stable boy&quot;.  Perhaps retained for sentimental value by a small group of eccentric (although, by definition, fanatical) hobbyists.  But otherwise rightly forgotten.",1454620671

Watch OS was slow, buggy and limited at release. It&#x27;s pretty much at a 1.0 state right now. The new Apple TV is by far the best version of the Apple TV, but the OS is buggy and still needs refinement.<p>My take on this is two-fold:<p>1) Apple is doing more and more products, causing there to be issues with newer products. They haven&#x27;t been putting in the QA work on newer software. OS X is old and mature software, so it&#x27;s pretty stable, but something like Watch OS is very new.<p>2) Apple&#x27;s insistence on yearly OS upgrades is causing there to be a lot of 1.0 roughness each year. Just slowing down to a two-year cycle would allow for a lot more time to refine and more time where the OS has been patched and is the latest OS. iOS 10 will be announced in a few months, but iOS 9 still has at least one major point update to go.",1454620632

11037253,comment,11032428,11033632,0,0,tempestn,,,"> Do you think people who own a house should be allowed to buy a 2nd one and push first time buyers out the market?<p>Just to address this, first, <i>yes</i>, I absolutely think people need to be able to buy a second house.  There is also a natural impediment in place of investors buying up &quot;too many&quot; houses.  The reason is, if there are more houses on the rental market than there is demand for rentals, it will drive rental rates down.  Similarly, if there are not enough houses for sale to fill demand of all these investors as well as purchases for-self, it will drive house prices up.  As those two things happen, the rate of return on an investment property will quickly become lower than that of other comparable investments, so people will not rationally keep buying investment properties until either prices go back down or more houses are built (which will also drive prices back down).<p>Obviously in the short term people don&#x27;t always act rationally, but that situation can&#x27;t logically persist indefinitely.  (And while it does, renters get below-market rent, subsidized by owners.  That was has been the case here in Canada for the past few years, and I happily rented for several of those years.)  Long term though, investment owners will earn just enough return to make it worthwhile for them to provide the service of rental housing to people who want it.  That&#x27;s a good thing.<p>Now imagine if people <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> buy second houses.  It would be impossible to rent, because there would be no unoccupied homes.  Yes, it would bring house prices down, but what if you were just starting out and didn&#x27;t have the money to buy a home, even a cheap one?  You would then have no options.  I know you&#x27;re not really advocating for outlawing second houses completely, but incentives for first-time buyers over investment buyers would have a similar effect to the lesser extent.  You would be making first-time ownership cheaper, <i>and renting more expensive</i>.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think that <i>some</i> help for first time buyers is terrible policy.  However, I think better policy would be to focus on helping young people in general.  For instance, instead of a first time home buyers&#x27; credit, there could be a special reduced tax rate on the first $X (or £Y :P ) that a person earns after age 18.  (Possibly varied on a means-tested basis.)  That would help people get started, either saving up a down payment, or starting an investment portfolio, without skewing the housing and rental markets.<p>Of course I recognize that the problem with that plan is that many, or even most, people would waste that money instead of saving it.  By tying it to house purchase, you force people to put it into an asset, and in turn, owning a home forces people to save (in the form of equity).  However, we need to find a different solution to that problem, because we&#x27;ll never be (or want to be) at the point where everyone is a home owner, and right now the people who most need that leg up early in life are the ones who aren&#x27;t getting it.  I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, but there are certainly possibilities.  For instance, a defined benefit state-backed pension plan can prevent people with no savings from being screwed in retirement.  It could be made possible to borrow from one&#x27;s state pension plan to buy a first home.  In theory that should not skew prices vs rents as much as a straight tax break, because it&#x27;s not free money.  And it would be more equitable, because people who choose not to use it (or who aren&#x27;t able to) will still get an equivalent benefit.",1454620340

So libraries like tornado, django and flask are affected, and likely some scientific libraries as well.<p>This problem should be fixed in Python 3.5: io.BytesIO becomes as efficient as cStringIO for read-only cases since Python 3.5.",1454619896

11037209,comment,11033718,11037122,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"<i>The benefit that a free market is expected to give to society is, as far as I know, that it will cause a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; scenario in which the best solutions for a problem gain widespread acceptance and bad solutions die out.</i><p>Not at all the case. You&#x27;re injecting Social Darwinist assumptions. The benefit of a free market is in having individuals coordinate their plans most efficiently based on their subjective preferences and valuations, with prices as an epistemic vehicle for conveying notions of scarcity, opportunity for arbitrage or other criteria. It is thus a continuous and dynamic disequilibrium process that one cannot anticipate through outside observation, as optimal outcomes are by definition always being revised, renewed and discovered endogenously.<p><i>But that of course only works if there is actual competition - which in many fields isn&#x27;t the case in our current situation.</i><p>Competitiveness is one aspect, but a much more important one is constestability. Free markets are by definition ones allowing for the greatest degree of it. And I absolutely agree that our <i>current</i> situation is far from optimal. We are not discussing our current situation, however. Monopolies are a multifaceted subject, many of them based on rents obtained from IP law and hardly &quot;natural&quot;.<p><i>Similar thinks can happen with large-scale accumulation of property.</i><p>There are things called diseconomies of scale that put upper bounds on the profitability and viability of being too big. Economic calculation issues set in, principal-agent inefficiencies, coordination problems and so forth. It is only through the subsidy of an exogenous body such as government that one can hobble along in inefficacy for exorbitantly long times.",1454619873

We visualised all the money that we spent in 2015 in a nice infographic (18% R&D, 12% PR&Marketing etc) so we can show it to our current and upcoming investors to increase their trust towards us and our credibility as young entrepreneurs. Transparency is always a great thing.\nThis post could be a good example for fellow entrepreneurs to get an idea how to plan their budget (definitely will depend on what, where, who and how but it can provide good hints). To also see where you could save money and where to spend more to make your startup better. \nNo one can predict if this is the right way to do it but in our case, this year we will save money on R&D and Operational Costs and spent more in Sales & Marketing to increase revenue.\nAny feedback would be more than welcome.\nCheers.",1454619805

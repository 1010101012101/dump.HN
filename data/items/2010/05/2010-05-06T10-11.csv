I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have.' I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision.

It did some of those magical things that their computer does, and that they think they couldn't understand in a million years.  And all of a sudden, instead of people's eyes glazing over, I started getting comments like ""I really don't know how you do this stuff, that's amazing!""<p>There seem to be two things that are important here - one is that you need to be working on a product that is user-facing, so that they can actually use what you have just made.

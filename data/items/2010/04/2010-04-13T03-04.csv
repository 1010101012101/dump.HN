Recently they also announced using unity on Android, PS3, XBOX360 and more to come.  They already supported exports to desktop (Mac and PC), web player (all browsers) and widgets.<p>I imagine that their recent news about cross platform can't have helped their favor.  But many flash devs bought a Mac and started doing iPhone dev simply for Unity 3D.<p>I am a game developer and bought a Macbook Pro just to use Unity 3d before when it was a Mac only IDE.   I also bought an iMac later and many touches and iPhones.  Unity might be solely responsible for making me a Mac user to start since 2006-7 (intel based and being <i>nix rooted with the best </i>nix GUI ever as well maybe). Sad that Apple doesn't see that much. Many, many, many game devs bought a Mac solely based on Unity.",1271130533

Each one is excellent and interesting in its own way.<p>> A lot of writeups repeat a ""nine nines"", ie 99.9999999% reliability claim for Erlang-based Ericsson telephone switches owned by British Telecoms. This works out to 31 milliseconds of downtime per year, which hovers near the edge of measurability, not to say plausibility. I was present at a talk Armstrong gave in early 2010 during which he was asked about this. There was a little foot shuffling as he qualified it: it was actually 6 or so seconds of downtime in one device during a code update. Since BT had X devices over Y years, they calculated it as 31ms of average downtime per device per year. Or something like that. Either way it's an impressive feat.",1271129777

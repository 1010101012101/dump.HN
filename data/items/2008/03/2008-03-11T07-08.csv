134043,comment,133612,133741,0,0,maximilian,,,"On this tangent.  I think that the moment I realized that nobody thinks as complicated as we think they do.  Basically it boiled down to this thought, ""If that girl came up to me right now, how would I feel?"" ""I'd feel great thats what!"". And then I get up the balls to go and talk to her.  The idea of putting myself in other's shoes really changed my attitude on a lot of things.",1205221458

Come to think of it, I felt enlightened by it even despite a teacher who wanted to be an actuary but had to teach AP Stat instead because she couldn't pass her actuarial exam, in addition to all the usual horrors bemoaned in the Lockhart essay that was posted the other day.  I suppose that suggests that under more organic learning conditions, it would have been quite exciting.",1205220637
134029,comment,133978,133978,0,0,jmtulloss,,,"I agree. I personally don't really want to listen to people that care immensely about their karma scores.<p>I think an exponential decay on how much karma you get based on upmods per second would be sufficient to avoid people rampantly upmodding. It takes time to read an article and its comments, and it seems like measuring that would be an effective way of preventing rampant abuse.<p>Of course, people could just write scripts then to upmod all the time once they figured out the optimal delay. Then there would be an entirely different form of karma inflation to fight. Like spam, it seems to be a never ending battle.",1205220618

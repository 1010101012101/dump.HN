2256186,comment,2255698,2256161,0,0,lincolnq,,,"Hmm. An interesting observation, but is mutation really the problem here? I'm not sure it is... we are able to transform any program with mutation into an equivalent program where each variable is assigned once upon allocation. (If you don't already know what it is, this transformation is called static single assignment.)<p>Anyway, it's really hard (undecidable in the general case) to compare two programs and determine whether they do the same thing. Is that what you're proposing?<p>And even if you could compare programs like that reliably, it seems impractical to apply it to the giant body of today's source code, but maybe you have an idea for doing that?",1298501913

The old regime in Iraq also had a penchant for both as well. Going back further, Japanese and German nationalists also were huge proponents of both big domestic infrastructure projects and nationalistic wars.<p>If you are looking at US politics, the wars mentioned by danenania were all started by US politicians who were also proponents of big infrastructure (Truman, Kennedy, Nixon). I don't think they were nationalistic wars, however.<p>Am I missing something here?<p>(Note: I'm ignoring former Communists, since Communism officially disavowed nationalism. In cases of other nationalistic wars, e.g. Rwanda or Kosovo, I don't know the opinions of politicians on infrastructure.)",1298501807

Given the indeterminacy of much of game theory (i.e., it depends on how you model the scenario), I'm sure you could be right under the proper assumptions.<p>But to bring it back to the SO example, it's hard to imagine a scenario where giving high ability workers the ability to truthfully signal that high ability hurts. Low ability workers can be hurt i.e., either I know you're bad from your SO rep, or I start to think ""hey - where's your SO profile? you must be bad."" In the pre-SO system, the low ability workers were getting an unearned rent (assuming the market existed at all) at the expense of the high ability workers and firms (which is market-killing).",1298501725

    A: As Jeopardy devotees know, if you're trying to win on the show, the buzzer is
    all. On any given night, nearly all the contestants know nearly all the
    answers, so it's just a matter of who masters buzzer rhythm the best.

    Watson does have a big advantage in this regard, since it can knock out a
    microsecond-precise buzz every single time with little or no variation. Human
    reflexes can't compete with computer circuits in this regard. But I wouldn't
    call this unfair...precise timing just happens to be one thing computers are
    better at than we humans. It's not like I think Watson should try buzzing in

So what's the problem? Doctors can't get paid for any of this.<p>Despite common belief, doctors don't get paid that much, particularly doctors that work in the public setting and must deal with Medicare (and in California, MediCal) patients. If a neurologist in San Francisco sees a Medicare patient in Los Angeles through video conferencing they can't bill Medicare because LA is not a non-Metropolitan Statistical Area. No doctor wants to deal with dismal MediCal rates. There are little to no codes to bill for home-based monitoring, and if even those exist, there is no code for a specialist to diagnose remotely. We have 30 years of academic literature praising TM. So who's holding everything up?<p>We need a new insurance company that focuses on TM and monitoring technologies from the start to usher in what everyone and their mom has been describing as ""preventive"" healthcare. Sure, we'll still need traditional methods for surgeries and catastrophic events, but I'd pay out of pocket to be able to forward an image of a rash to a dermatologist or the back of my throat to my physician any day.

Little did I know, after working on it for a month, I saw vast potential in the basis of the project and decided to start over but make everything insanely flexible.  Being arrogant as I was, I figured it wouldn't take more than a month or two.  But of course it added on a few more months of (hard!) work and now almost 8 months later I'm literally less than a day away from actual release.  (Look out for a rate my startup thread, hopefully tomorrow! ;))<p>Now, my determination (more like obsession) to get it 99% to what I'd imagined it to be months ago has led me to probably a situation that could be better.  I probably could have released the app months ago at 50% and received awesome feedback along the way molding its design to exactly as customers want... while having a much larger customer-base and awareness than I do currently (practically none! :()... but I was afraid it would get a bad reputation early on and turn off more customers in the long run.  But now in retrospect, if I'd known this from the beginning I'd have gone in a direction that allowed me to release much earlier without compromising the app's reputation.

But in the end, what we really want to show to musicians who come to Weeizc, is  that it is possible to go much further than just sheet music, or even play-along mp3s.<p>I hope this ambition of bringing a new dimension to classical music practice is clearly visible.

I recommend that you describe what the product does for the users rather than describe what how its implemented :<p>""A web app that teaches robot children how to speak in idioms.

But print books (and ebooks from random House) are still sold under the old wholesale model. Amazon pays about half the cover price and can set the retail price at whatever it likes, generally at a big discount.

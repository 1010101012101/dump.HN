Assuming that is the case, it's less important for trains to minimize weight per passenger than it is for airplanes to do so, and space/comfort is directly related to weight per passenger.",1360555194

5199285,comment,5198679,5199234,7,0,kposehn,,,"It isn't that I assume they'd use existing lines, it is just that most of the good mountain passes are already taken. Furthermore, the existing alignments show how difficult it is to cross those mountains in the first place. Hell, there are many places in the US where even the Interstate network couldn't find a better route - like along the Colorado River east of Grand Junction.<p>A lot of politicians and advocacy groups like to point to existing lines as a solution to crossing mountains and getting through cities. This is rather short-sighted as rail lines in the US are designed for slower moving heavy-tonnage and don't take advantage of the differences HSR alignments have.<p>When you want to run an HSR line, your requirements are quite different. Regular (read: freight) lines require easier grades and can take sharper curves due to their slower speeds and heavier tonnage. The busiest mountain passes typically have no more than 2-2.5% ruling grades, using curves to lessen the steepness. HSR can use much steeper grades (5%) but requires extremely gentle curves, which then demands a lot of expensive tunnel and bridge work.<p>When you want to take an HSR rail line across a series of mountains like the Tehachapi range, you run into a major problem. The change in elevation is extremely sudden and drainages are short, curvy and have steep walls. The end result is that you have to do many cuts, fills, bridges and tunnels to get up the grade. The expense is astronomical compared to a regular highway, yet most proposals don't actually take that into account.<p>However, the man who designed the map is at least a bit more realistic about the cost (several trillion). I do firmly believe that HSR is actually quite viable in the US in many places, it just isn't something we can draw on a map and say ""here we go!""<p>We have to solve the problem of topography vs. budget. If we want a truly national network like shown in the map, we have to accept that the cost will be enormous - likely many times that of the interstate system (in today's dollars). If the people are willing to take that cost, then it should be built, but we should be careful what we propose to make sure it is truly viable.",1360554698

-visual analytics on photos/videos (via object recognition) 
- text analytics on comments/tweets
- likes/+1s
- browsing
- ad/deal/commerce activities<p>We also offer APIs for personalized recommendations, persona similarity, and likely intent score.<p>Vufinds Interest Graph platform allows you to:
personalize your app/sites user experience
deliver behavioral/contextual targeting of ads/recommendations/deals etc.
offer image based commerce (think identify a purse in a photo, offer  buy a similar purse at amazon)
do some cool audience clustering based on granular interests<p>You can try all of these APIs for free.
Checkout the API documentation on our developers site.

There is a reason Amtrak is absolutely destroying air travel in the Northeast corridor, especially among business travelers. I can get work done on a NYC to DC train trip. I can't get any work done on the corresponding airplane trip, between the tight spaces, the cabin pressure changes, etc.<p>> 2) As a practical matter, you don't need to. It takes you 30 extra minutes to get from the outskirts of cities to the centers, versus an extra 8 hours for train travel to get you to the city center. Perspective.<p>But not all trips are NYC to LA. The shorter the distance, the more time spent getting from an airport into the city impacts the overall travel time. HSR would get you from downtown NYC to downtown DC in 95 minutes. Getting from downtown to LaGuardia is 30 minutes and from Reagan to downtown is another 15 minutes best case, possibly a lot more with weekday traffic. More importantly to a business traveler, that's 45-60 minutes they're probably not getting any work done, while the train traveler is getting work done the extra 25 minutes the train is actually traveling versus the flight.<p>HSR is supposed to do Boston to DC in 3 hours, versus 90 minutes for a plane trip. Add in airport time and time spent in the airport, the total travel time is probably a wash, but again much of the travel time for air travel is cabbing and waiting in line at the airport during which you can't get any work done. So the HSR still wins.<p>DC to Boston is about 450 miles. There are a lot of major North American cities within ~500 miles of each other. E.g. Chicago to Toronto, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Milwaukee, etc. There's tens of millions of people in a ~500 mile radius of Chicago, and HSR would beat air travel for those trips.",1360553727

The other most important thing is that you keep making things. Even little things. Make them and show them to people and get feedback. Lather, rinse and repeat.<p>Anyhow... You will want to specifically look for books on Typography, Color, Layout, Photography, Contrast/Scale, and Poster Design. Poster Design is actually sui generis despite appearing to be a subset of graphic design.[1]<p>My belief is strongly on the side of typography being the most crucial skill a designer needs (since its use of space/contrast/layout) is basically design in a micro level, rather than on the macro (page) level. The skills you pick up in typography <i>do</i> translate over, but it takes lots of practice. Since illustrators are readily hopping into many design jobs, our best bet is to differentiate ourselves with our exhaustive knowledge of typography.<p>A great book on ""Book Typography"" is Cyrus Highsmith's Inside Paragraphs.<p>A good book on ""Display Typography"" is Wolfgang Weingart's My Way to Typography.<p>Three good books on ""Typographic Fundamentals"" are: Ellen Lupton's Thinking With Type, John Kane's Type Primer and Erik Spiekermann's Stop Stealing Sheep (and find out how type works).<p>One excellent ""Typographic Reference"" is Robert Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style.<p>One good book about ""Design Process"" is Nancy Skolos & Tom Wedell's Graphic Design Process.<p>No design book suggestion will be complete without mentioning Emil Ruder's Typographie, Josef Muller-Brockman's Grid Systems and Armin Hofmann's Graphic Design Manual.<p><i>That</i> said, a good starter is layout/formmaking Christian Leborg's ""Visual Grammar,"" part of Princeton Architectural Press' Design Briefs series[2] (all of which are good for skimming the next time you find yourself in a bookstore/amazon showroom).<p>Finally, I never realized it until I made a joke about it, but you can summarize many of the principles of good UI Design in PEP 20, which is to say that if you care about API Design and Code Cleanliness and all that stuff, then you probably already have the right attitude towards graphic/visual design. Take those principles and apply them visually when you make anything or use them as a rough litmus test for your designs then break the rules as you see fit.<p>Have fun! Relax. Don't Panic!<p>[0]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1605228"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1605228</a>
[1]: While poster design employs many of the same structural techniques as Capital-D Design, it has its own rules which are useful to know, but above all it is free to play with scale in a way which is <i>difficult</i> in web and book design. Still, knowing about it will inform your own work and probably make it wayyyy more fun.

You have been warned.<p>My favorite system that supports hot-swapping is Linux.<p>It works with every language, there is an excellent scheduler, processes are protected from each other, there are all kinds of interprocess communication techniques available, you can choose between files and databases for persistence.<p>I think the lame workflows people have while working within a conventional OS are a failure of imagination and a lack of understanding about how operating systems work. In particular, I suspect that a lot of people overestimate the cost of exec and IPC. Or, for example, do you really appreciate the fact that the operating system keeps file system data in RAM even if you exit the program and start up another one accessing the same file a microsecond later? Image-based persistence is not necessary for responsiveness.<p>Use exec(), use a database, create the editors that make you productive.

And it's not really just a Windows thing, as far back as I can remember, across several OSs, you don't really have to ""figure out"" how the file manager works. You click on something and it pretty much does what it says. You drag something and it moves there. Various *nix window managers, Amiga, geos, BeOS, and on and on and on are pretty much just walk-up usable.<p>With Finder I feel like I'm gambling. Where in the filesystem hierarchy will the new folder I just created get made? Why is enter rename? Why do you show me a useless file path that I can't use for any navigation? Network shares disappear. It's never wide enough to actually see the names of my files. All my files is probably one of the dumbest notions I've ever seen in a file management tool -- yay, I have a uselessly long list of all 2.7 million files I can go through, and we'll default to it also! and on and on and on, hour after mind-numbing hour. How about this folder? How much space do I have left? How big is the selection of files I have currently selected? Why don't the unintuitive iconoglyphs have some kind of description? Why are these ones down in the window, but other ones I need to use a million times a day up in the tool bar?<p>Almost every interaction with Finder feels like I'm about to lose data, or the default is so completely brain dead that I have to go into preferences to fix almost every interaction to make finder even remotely useful. It's no wonder there's a dozen or so finder replacements that end up as default installs for most of the old-timer Mac guys I know.<p>It's unbelievably unintuitive bitrot -- endless preference fiddling, and the feeling of walking a tightrope anchored with eggshells with every interaction. There's really few pieces of software I loathe to use, and it's a shame that it's pretty much the most basic piece of software in the OS.<p>In the context of how abysmal finder is, it actually makes sense that Apple has gone out of its way to abstract the user away from the file system. From the perspective of a Windows user it seems like madness, but after enough time in OS X finder hell it makes perfect rational sense. You simply don't want to subject users to this level of frustration just to organize their mp3s or pictures. It may also explain why similar efforts in Windows land don't do as well, managing and organizing files is no less mysterious or confusing than any other organizational app, usually less so.",1360552715

The major problem facing the Global Financial System(tm) is not high-frequency trading, it is large, illiquid, unhedged assets held by systemically important financial institutions. The nature of an illiquid asset is that it is traded infrequently, which makes it especially un-affected by a transaction tax.<p>OTOH, a tax like this may discourage high-frequency trading [despite it not being at all a systemic risk], but it also discourages certain legitimate and extremely useful forms of hedging, such as large notional currency swaps [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_swap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_swap</a>]. And in the likely event that some esoteric forms of derivatives are exempt from the tax [they may be executed overseas, or just be exempted from the statute due to lobbying pressure] then it will encourage banks to shift trading activity from actual assets to much-more-fragile derivatives.<p>Bottom line: it's very likely that the net result of any Tobin Tax type implementation will be to actually make the Global Financial System(tm) <i>more</i> dangerous. And that's assuming you can actually discourage HFT, which is not at all clear. It will probably just migrate to some island that sets up a tax-shelter exchange.<p>I have no great love for HFT, but this proposal is the epitome of dangerous, populist feel-goodery.

We're discussing a 6 year span here, career politicians can potentially spend decades in office depending on how little their constituency changes and how happy their constituency is with their voting record. The second part is critical as it's not usual to have a vote by vote explanation that could be used as fodder by either a primary challenger or a challenger from the other party.<p>Like I said, I admire the guy, especially if his libertarian-ism extends to areas that dovetail with the GOP and Tea Party on social issues like gay marriage or marijuana legalization.

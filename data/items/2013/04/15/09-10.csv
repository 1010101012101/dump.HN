5550618,comment,5548730,5550112,1,0,zanny,,,"But I'm asking for a <i>specific</i> example of a natural monopoly that <i>isn't</i> the result of infrastructure (which is best not even done privately and is best a public good) and <i>can't</i> have its prohibitive costs to enter the result of artificial government scarcity (arguing a nuclear plant is prohibitively expensive to build because the designs are all patented, for example, falls into that category).<p>I just can't think of one. Almost any ""natural"" monopoly (roads, healthcare, power grid, network cable, etc) I think should be done by local government, not private business, because structural aspects of society aren't effective platforms for competition if they just supply the foundations to build markets upon.<p>Actually, I just thought of one - maybe agriculture. While it is structural, it isn't an inherent infrastructure because it has specialized purpose. The post green revolution has demonstrated (though I imagine it is the result of regulation this happens) that megafarms are the most efficient way to organize modern farming. This naturally leads to a few big players because the cost of equipment to properly maximize productivity of land has high expenses (though they aren't at a comparable scale to say, a road network, or laying fiber in a city - one tractor, plow, tiller, etc plus the seed, silos, barns, etc, but these are tools to maximize productivity, not infrastructure).<p>It might be the product of land ownership and zoning, but I'm only familiar with my local zoning code, which has a large Mennonite population, so most of the farmland in the region is restricted from being sold for other purposes. The midwest is a much different story that I'm not familiar with.",1366019875

I once studied procrastination while I was procrastinating at work and here are my 3 tricks that work, at least half the time:<p>1. Just don't do what you have to do.  Just sit there. BUT the catch is you are not allowed to do ANYTHING else.  After about 15 minutes of doing nothing, your interest creeps back for your the task you are working on.<p>2. Make a big 3 list.  At the very beginning of the day, write down the 3 most important things to get done that day.  Only work on those things.<p>3. Cut up the elephant.  This is the biggest thing helps me.  Many times the items on our todo lists are really gargantuan tasks!  Your brain unconsciously knows this and will try to avoid these loaded tasks.  Break them down into bite sized elephant chunks.  Elephant wasn't eaten in a day ; )  You'll feel better as you knock through those smaller todos.  I also recommend Tudumo (www.tudumo.com) as a todo tracker.  It has a lot of keyboard shortcuts.   I have a list called ""elephant chunks"" and as soon as I tackle an item on the main list, I create the elephant chunks list and start hammering those suckers down.<p>I still lapse into massive procrastination, but these tricks have helped me a lot.  You aren't alone.  And I don't think you are lazy.  If you are anything like me, this is probably some of the stuff you are most passionate about and it's killing you that you are avoiding it.  Make a new big 3 list every day and don't give up!",1366019440

The evidence from science suggests that business people must be insane to use brainstorming groups, wrote the organizational psychologist Adrian Furnham. If you have talented and motivated people, they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority.<p>> The reasons brainstorming fails are instructive for other forms of group work, too. People in groups tend to sit back and let others do the work; they instinctively mimic others opinions and lose sight of their own; and, often succumb to peer pressure. The Emory University neuroscientist Gregory Berns found that when we take a stance different from the groups, we activate the amygdala, a small organ in the brain associated with the fear of rejection. Professor Berns calls this the pain of independence.<p>I feel like productivity and creativity are both absolutely possible in a team setting, just as much as they are in solitude.

5550569,comment,5549250,5550441,4,0,mrb,,,"InclinedPlane, your anti-deflationary arguments can be refuted in 4 different ways:<p>1. A deflationary currency strongly encourages businesses to maximize revenues today instead of tomorrow, because they know they can get more units of the deflationary currency today rather than tomorrow. This incentive does not exist with inflationary currencies.<p>2. If you had 100% confidence in Bitcoin being deflationary, you would invest in bitcoins. But the fact you do not (I presume) shows a very important point: you, like many, doubt Bitcoin will remain deflationary on the long term (eg. it might crash to zero). This uncertainty is why, despite being in theory deflationary, Bitcoin will continue to see a growing economy. People will continue to invest and spend bitcoins, because the future of Bitcoin, like the future of any currency (inflationary or deflationary), is fundamentally uncertain.<p>3. There is an often-cited counter-example to the argument that ""people will not spend if they know prices will decline in the future"" (as prices will in a deflationary currency): the electronics industry. Laptops, smartphones, servers, etc: prices are always decreasing. Yet this industry is very successful. Buyers are not afraid to spend money today, even if they know they can get the product for less tomorrow. This is because prices decreasing over time stimulate spending.<p>4. The traditional arguments against a deflationary currency only work within a self-contained economy anyway. Bitcoin currently exist as a side currency next to all other (USD, EUR, etc). People will still want to invest these currencies, and the Bitcoin economy being tightly coupled to\n others will naturally benefit from these investments.

5550562,comment,5550366,5550402,3,0,tomelders,,,"> My personal read on this is that, if you have difficulty focusing, you're not really interested in what you're doing.<p>I don't agree. I personally have lots of trouble focusing, and the more <i>into</i> something I am, the harder it is for me to focus. It's as though my thoughts go into overdrive and I feel actual pleasure in processing all the different facets and scenarios related to a particular idea, so much so that it incapacitates me and if I stop thinking about it, I start to feel miserable. Take writing for example, I'd love to write for a living but whenever I have an idea that I absolutely must get down on paper, a few things happen.<p>1- Nothing else matters, so everything else suffers.<p>2- Writing is too slow. Before I've finished a paragraph, my head has moved onto another chapter and trying to get back to where I was is like trying to tell myself to stop doing the most fun thing in the world and clean my kitchen instead. (I hope that makes sense).<p>3- It begins to dawn on me that I'm not making any progress. I start to feel mildly depressed and all by energy and excitement begins to dwindle as I realise <i>this time</i> is going to be like <i>every other time</i> and I'm not going to finish ""it"".<p>And then I go back to what I was working on before, all my energy and excitement in that project is renewed and then I repeat steps 1 to 3.<p>There is a huge difference between this and working on something that doesn't interest me. As a programmer, I often have to work on things that don't interest me, that are slow and laborious and repetitive. But the strange thing is, I can do that stuff to completion. It bores me to tears, and I start to hate my job if I have to do too much of it, but my brain gets out of the way for a while and lets me finish what I'm doing. Until I have another awesome idea for something, and then I'm screwed.<p>Luckily, I enjoy most of my work, and I get interesting problems to solve that, even though I've no burning desire to solve them, keep me interested and happy none the less.<p>This has gotten very personal very quickly. Reading this back, it sounds like I have will-power, self-control problems more than focus issues.<p>Well thanks HN, this has been very therapeutic.",1366018556

If you're studying for an exam: Try to summarize what you want to remember in as few words as possible - 1 or 2 words per point.

For each point, very quickly (e.g. less than 2-3 seconds), go through the entire point with your mind, then move on to the next. Repeat points that you feel you can't process as fast, they are what you need to get more familiar with. Once you get to the end, as long as you still got energy, go back to the beginning. Eventually try to recall every point the unit without even the single page of paper.<p>Do this as soon as possible after you wake up. (e.g. study after breakfast).

If they can afford 1 million, I offer 50 million. It doesnt make a difference to my life, because I have 1 trillion, but I put it out of reach of all the people who have 1 million.<p>In 1977 my parents bought a 1 bedroom apartment for INR 47000. At that time, my dad told me, salaries for average jobs were about INR 600. 100 times 600 = 60,000, so the max leverage was about 100 times.<p>Today in 2013, an average white collar salary in India is about 50,000 a month. Today In Bombay in my locality a 1 bed apartment is 85 lakhs (INR 8.5 million). What's the leverage?<p>50,000 x 1000 = 50,000,000 = INR 5 million. My leverage is > 1000 times. But wait, if you consider the dollar (my dad was a marine engineer who earned in dollars), I have seen it go up from INR 18 to today's INR 50. So multiply that another 4 times, my leverage is about 4000 compared to 1977. What happened? Inflation.<p>a.

I need an asset where I do no work, but earn money.<p>Every year people do economic business activities and generate wealth. Private equity companies invest in these companies and hence are able to increase their investors holdings.<p>But consider the extra income from 6% dividend. This is money that gives them an extra edge over everybody else. If the US raises 1 trillion dollars in bonds from the FED at 1% interest, the FED income is USD 10 billion. 6% of USD 10 billion is 600 million USD. But that income is only for the year 2013, to understand the total interest you must add up for all the bonds raised where the debt has not been paid back.

V8 is pretty awesome, but outside of a relatively narrow niche, the advantage of Node doesn't seem that huge to me.<p>* Yes, your code runs a lot faster in V8 than in CPython or Ruby, maybe a factor of 3 to 10 slower than C (<a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=v8&lang2=gcc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?te...</a>) instead of the factor of 30 you get with CPython or YARV (<a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=yarv&lang2=gcc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?te...</a>) or the factor of 100 you get with MRI Ruby.  But much of the time, if a factor of 30 is a problem, so is a factor of 10!  And there are plenty of language implementations that get closer to C than V8 does, without being as error-prone and verbose as C (Java, SBCL, Ada (just kidding), Haskell, OCaml, Scala, occasionally LuaJIT).  PyPy has similar performance overall to V8, but a different performance profile.  See <a href=""http://speed.pypy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://speed.pypy.org/</a> for details.<p>* JS is a pretty reasonable language, and CS is even better, despite its lack of getters and setters, its stupid Ruby-derived inclusive-bounds ranges, and a few other minor warts.  But it's not nearly as clean as Python or as flexible as Ruby.<p>* Node makes you rewrite your program into explicit continuation-passing style every time you do I/O, in order to maintain responsiveness.  Also, every time you do a potentially long computation, unless they've finally gotten around to adding Web Workers to Node.  I've done this in order to get massively scalable I/O in high-performance systems in C, Python, and JS, and it is my considered opinion that it is sometimes not the best way to do things.  In cases where this <i>is</i> the best option, Python has Twisted and Tornado, which give you the massively-scalable nonblocking goodness while they still let you run other threads if that's what you think best.<p>* npm is a pretty amazing ecosystem, but the Python, Ruby, and C ecosystems are orders of magnitude bigger.  On my netbook right now, among other things, I have Python bindings to 0MQ, D-Bus, GConf, TidyLib, DNS, GObject, CUPS, Cairo, and the GNOME keyring.  Of these, 0MQ, D-Bus, DNS, and Cairo have bindings in npm, while GConf, TidyLib, GObject, CUPS, and the GNOME keyring do not.  In realms like natural language processing, symbolic mathematics, and numerical computation (e.g. DSP), there's nothing in the JS world that comes close.  Note that this objection applies also to PyPy, since many Python bindings do not yet work with PyPy.<p>PyPy also offers massive multithreading (a la Erlang, Golang, or rust) and sandboxing (the ability to run untrusted code safely, at least in theory); it contains a generalized JIT compiler generator that allows you to write JIT compilers for other languages very easily; and the PyPy people are working on software transactional memory and dynamic code generation for numerical algorithms.<p>In summary, I agree that Node is pretty awesome, especially, as you say, coupled with CoffeeScript, and also when you want to share code between browser and server.  But there are still valid reasons for choosing other alternatives.",1366016459

Sure enough, there are some things that dynamic binary modification(DBM) does that can also be implemented another way (e.g. generic application level profiling), but even some of those things are sometimes done faster/better by DBM tools: Want to log the system calls to RANDOM_SYSCALL? Sure, use ptrace and do these context switches: app>kernel>ptrace_app>kernel(actual syscall)>ptrace_app>kernel>app every time any system call executes... Or use PIN and take the usually small performance hit. ptrace also messes up signal delivery.<p>Want to profile dynamically generated code? libelf won't be much help there. Or do you want to run memory accesses through a cache simulator? ptrace won't be much help. There are plenty of uses when DBM is the right (or only) tool.",1366016452

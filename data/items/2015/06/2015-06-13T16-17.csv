Generally begins with something aptly labeled the &quot;Four Noble Truths&quot;.  To &quot;choose&quot; to falsify these is  ignorance, (the default starting point for everyone born) and subsequently realising that it cannot be done, is the experiment you must do on yourself.  There is no one else who can write it down for you to read and then think about it once over and to &quot;get&quot; it like a math theorem is not what you should be expecting.  This is more and more obvious once you take a look at the the substantial buddhist writings; all of it is entirely based in solid logical thinking, yet where it points is not a place where logic can go.<p>To clarify, reincarnation in this context is happening dozens of times every second.  So then, &quot;you&quot; don&#x27;t really last all that long, and there really isn&#x27;t a constant &quot;you&quot; anyway.  And what happens in-between those beats?  Ah, look into -that-.",1434214799

To understand Go, you need to understand the history of the Bell Labs gurus somewhere around the late 9th and 10th editions of Research Unix, when the vestiges of what would become Plan 9 and Inferno began to take shape (the sam editor that would influence acme, the rc shell, mk and the predecessor to 9P [streams] would all originate here - see &quot;Interprocess Communication in the Ninth Edition Unix System&quot; [1]).<p>Meanwhile, Rob Pike and his contemporaries did language research, particularly related to the semantics of CSP-style concurrency. Syntactically they were all C-like, as the Plan 9/Research Unix community all generally liked it.<p>Newsqueak was the first and it was a cross between C and with special syntax and semantics for procs (green threads). It was written for GUI workstation environments in mind, the idea being to easily build multi-seat applications. From Newsqueak arose Alef, which refined on it but had manual memory management. Then from Alef came Limbo, the language running on top of the Dis VM that formed the core of the Inferno OS.<p>Fast forward some years later, Rob Pike and some other Bell Labs vets are at Google. Some event happens which painfully reminds them of mediocrity in computing, that gives them the drive again and they resume right where they left from Limbo.<p>Go is born.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cm.bell-labs.co/who/dmr/ipcpaper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cm.bell-labs.co/who/dmr/ipcpaper.html</a>",1434214739

9711630,comment,9708282,9709789,0,0,thoughtpolice,,,"It&#x27;s worth clarifying this a bit because there are a lot of subtle implications about what it means to be &#x27;reproducible&#x27; or &#x27;deterministic&#x27;.<p>To make the terminology clearer, I like to use the term &#x27;deterministic&#x27; vs &#x27;reproducible&#x27;. A deterministic build is one which, if it works, will <i>always</i> work, and follow the same steps. A reproducible build is one that you can reproduce identically, down to each individual SHA1-hash. This is what Debian has spearheaded, and what they mean by &#x27;reproducible build&#x27;.<p>At the moment, Nix packages are deterministic - but they are not reproducible.<p>If I have a specific git revision of nixpkgs (the repository containing all package descriptions), and I say &#x27;install mutt&#x27;, I&#x27;m guaranteed that I will always get the same build results. No matter when/where I do it. That means I&#x27;m always going to get mutt version x.y, with dependencies A, B, and C, all with their own exact versions, and features enabled. The same optimization levels. The steps the compiler uses to build everything will be the same, etc.<p>You can essentially think of a &#x27;nix expression&#x27; as a program that gets compiled to a shell script, which does a build, and you run the shell script. So if you have git revision DEADBEEF of the &#x27;nixpkgs&#x27; set, and you &#x27;run the compiler&#x27;, so to speak, to generate a &#x27;builder&#x27; from a Nix expression - it seems very obvious it will do the exact same thing, every time, regardless if you run it today or next week.<p>The thing is, this is a pretty nice property. In Debian for example, if I &#x27;apt-get install&#x27; something, I may <i>not</i> get the same program if I do it today and then do it tomorrow, because it may get updated. This, in practice, is kind of a big deal actually. It means it&#x27;s impossible (unless you use your own mirror) to actually have things like prod/development environments the exact same without imaging them like Docker. And of course, this makes rollbacks impossible because the set of packages on your system is really a bunch of mutable variables.<p>For example I used to do security research, and it was a massive pain in the ass when I would try to &#x27;apt-get install&#x27; mysql and get a patched version already. I needed to write code to find this vulnerability, AND I want to regression test that code in the future. But I can&#x27;t. It makes it very hard to do things like write automation to make sure you can detect if mysql is vulnerable (because where will you get the pristine package you originally tested with?)<p>Similarly, because of this property, you can be sure a developer&#x27;s computer is <i>exactly</i> the same as a production or staging environment for example. Because the &#x27;state&#x27; of your whole computer is really a function of two arguments - a function of your configuration.nix and your nixpkgs package set. This is what it means to be a &#x27;purely functional&#x27; distribution!<p>But the builds aren&#x27;t reproducible yet. There&#x27;s all kinds of actual &#x27;non-determinism&#x27; in the build process for any one specific project that makes bit-for-bit reproductions difficult. For example people use `__DATE__`, or they do weird things like rely on build mtimes, or other crazy stuff. Debian has tracked tons of these down - so it&#x27;s doable!<p>There is a branch of Nixpkgs that aims to fix this. Hopefully it will be solved for NixOS 15.10.",1434214668

Europe will never be the US and does not need to. Germany itself is a federal project with differences among the states. Take the UK, Spain or Belgium for even harsher examples. With these differences even within the European states, you cannot expect them to give away control over economic and fiscal policies without any gain of influence. That is not how democracy works. If my money is spent, I want the right to vote on how it is spent.<p>I also want the UK in. For hundreds of years Europe’s situation was decided by how well its great powers got along with each other. I think the UK is essential for the definition of Europe. Besides that: The UK has virtually no industry left and London is the biggest financial market in Europe. As someone living in Frankfurt I am okay with that. But do you really think the UK does not know, that Germany will not let them leave without taking London away? I recently talked to a German MEP, who said this in nicer terms.

The C standard library was incorporated into the language spec for C89.  The behaviors of the named functions within it are specified, and the compiler is allowed to inline it&#x27;s own version (ignoring your custom code) and then optimize out the inlined portion.<p>So while it&#x27;s possible that the external linkage approach still works with certain compilers, it&#x27;s not portable.  I believe you are OK with the external approach if you use a non-standard name (my_secure_memset_pretty_please()), but that just shifts the problem to forcing the compiler to generate your external function without making the same dangerous optimizations.<p>In the end, I fear you are left with three options: blind faith, non-standard language extensions, or switching to a more secure language (likely assembly).

About 6 weeks after I left, the owner dissolved the corporation and created a new one so he wouldn&#x27;t have to pay anyone shares that were promised.<p>This sort of behavior is common in the valley (re-incorporating to push undesirable people out) and playing semantic and number games on paper to liquidate employees shares.<p>It&#x27;s this sort of behavior that forces me to be unemployable as an experienced engineer.",1434212666

Though the people involved would be called &quot;friends of friends&quot;, I only very rarely agree with the second-order conclusions that FemFreq makes and I think their politics in particular around violence in media are profoundly weird and wrong. I have no beef with Mortal Kombat, and I own MKX. I&#x27;ve met Zoe Quinn probably half a dozen times and I don&#x27;t really care for her schtick or even the games she makes (though I&#x27;ll give her credit for Crash Override, I think that&#x27;s a good idea). I think Brianna Wu is kind of personally odious and is being as vocal and visible as she is to help raise her own profile. I think Shanley Kane is kind of a bully who wants people to feel bad at least as much as she wants things to change.<p>But all of that--yes, literally (who), all of that--is secondary to this: on the big, important things, they&#x27;re right. American culture is profoundly racist and sexist and video game culture is worse than average. Games are built largely to pander--not even just your average &quot;catering&quot;--to young white males, and even as a young(-ish) white male that kind of sucks. This is something we should talk about. This is a real thing.<p>What <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a real thing is the straight-up fiction told by Eron Gjoni that led directly to destroying a woman&#x27;s life. What <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a real thing is the catastrophic misreading of a couple of articles about the sublimation of &quot;gamer culture&quot; (what a joke) into the mainstream. &quot;&#x27;Gamer&#x27; is meaningless because everybody plays games&quot; turned into, in the minds of some very scared and very small people, &quot;fuck gamers they&#x27;re dead.&quot; The request for more representation in games permuted somehow into &quot;no representation for people like us&quot;, even though there&#x27;s literally (who) no way on God&#x27;s green earth that video game publishers would not still and forever cater to that population. &quot;Some people who like games and make games hang out with and know some people who like games and write about games&quot; turned into <i>ethics in games journalism</i>, while, all along and completely unmentioned, IGN et al, with their million-dollar ad spends (not necessarily corrupting, but a sort of bias that none of the GamerGate talking heads mention), and the straight-up YouTube <i>payola</i> schemes (you know, <i>actual corruption</i>) have gone unmentioned, almost certainly because they aren&#x27;t &quot;anti-GG&quot;.<p>So even setting aside the bad behavior that <i>overwhelmingly</i> comes from one side of the aisle, we are starting at a position of fundamental reasonableness versus fundamental unreasonableness.<p>Some of the people involved are people I would characterize as extremists, others to a large degree just bad actors. And if the criticisms <i>actually were</i> &quot;FemFreq makes stuff up for attention,&quot; I&#x27;d probably honestly be partly in agreement. But it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s really not. In the heart of hearts of the people doing this shit, it&#x27;s that women and minorities are elbowing their way to the table and the specter of loss of relative privilege is <i>scary</i> so we&#x27;d better fight back and the only way we know how to fight back is to try to make them give up by making it not worth the damage to their lives.<p>The fact of the matter is this: you lose when you start trying to hurt people. You just <i>do</i>. That, in the rhetoric you don&#x27;t actually care about, there&#x27;s a point to be considered actually and truly stops <i>mattering</i> when you are attempting, as a group, to hurt people in a concrete and tangible manner.

There are lots of ways you can make a mistake in writing the commands to be executed in a way that the command you intended won't run but will fail silently and you won't get any trace of an error happening. It is hard to even extract some common parts of commands and put them into a variable. I wasted hours and hours debugging weird cron errors. One case was where the crontab of one of the users was moved over to be the system crontab and strangely didn't work. Well, turns out the system wide crontab has one more field, but cron will not signal an error even in an obvious case like this, it will just fail silently (and this is the thing cron is really good at in my experience).",1363423256

5384874,comment,5384491,5384843,4,0,neya,,,"Your argument would be valid, but the scenarios you cite are totally orthogonal. Here's why:<p>1) You don't pay Facebook for their API. If something isn't working, you can't question anyone, nor are they liable to answer you. In short, they are doing you a favor by letting you use their API free of cost.<p>2) A credit card processor like Visa/Mastercard takes your money, and returns you a service instead. IF something isn't working as it should, you can call them and ask them what's wrong and they are liable to answer you, you can even request a refund, failing to provide which you could possibly drag them to a court, which isn't the case with an free API provider like Facebook/Twitter.<p>3) When you integrate the Facebook platform as an additional feature to your site, it's totally fine as long as it doesn't affect the core business model, because even if something gets screwed, users will not worry about a tiny missing feature. But when you build a business on top of someone else's API, be it Twitter or Facebook, it's like building a sand castle at the scale of a real world house and expecting it to be there forever. That's how vulnerable your business model becomes, because there is SO much that you have no control over. In the case of a credit card processor, they don't control your business model, they just do you a service in exchange for money, which is totally different, and you can change providers at a later stage if you find them unsatisfactory, which isn't the case with building something on top of an API like that of Facebook's/Twitter's.",1363422967

I think rotating the cookie on every request would be challenging (because, at any given time, there may be several requests active), but it's very easy to rotate the cookie every couple of minutes. Such rotation would mitigate all attacks that rely on forcing browsers to submit thousands of requests.<p>Web applications that use HTTP Authentication cannot be fixed in this way, because you cannot change the password regularly. Other protocols that carry plain-text passwords (after SSL) may be even more vulnerable, for the same reason. For example, authenticated SMTP may be the worst case if the attacker can consistently force an automated client to reconnect and try again.",1363422947

If you anticipate hitting scale, this can be tricky to engineer properly. Facebook clearly has the framework developed for doing all of these things but since their API lacks a real strategic purpose (other than to trick companies into a hostile dependency with Facebook), it is under-designed and frustrating to use.<p>If Facebook were to offer a service where they would charge some amount of money for an app to get an app-specific feed of friends, feed of yourself, list of friends using an app, hosting/indexing of open graph objects (read: just the metadata), and notifications on any activity related to your app, I would bet companies would pay. You can do all of this today, but it's a hodgepodge of FQL, periodical scraping, your own distribution, and gross overreaches in privacy.<p>In other words, if they actually ran the Graph API like a business and not some poorly disguised attempt at being ""Open"", Facebook could a) add another revenue stream, b) increase usage/engagement on their own platform, and c) save a lot of developers' time.",1363422175

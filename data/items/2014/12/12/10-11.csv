8739411,comment,8738939,8739307,0,0,vidarh,,,"Anything that takes time and that can be farmed out without creating lots of contention over access to the same memory is an &quot;obvious target for offloading&quot;.<p>Consider that many people were arguing that IO, graphics and sound offloading was totally unnecessary even in the face of seeing what it did for architectures like the Amiga until costs came down for it and CPU speeds remained unable to do the stuff that the offloading made possible.<p>IO in particular seemed pointless to many people: After all you&#x27;re still going to wait for your file to load, aren&#x27;t you? But loading data can often be made into a massively parallel task: For starters, you can widen the amount of data transferred with each unit of time. But secondly: you rarely just want to dump your data into memory; you usually wants to do some processing on it (e.g. build up data structures).<p>AmigaOS went further, and demonstrated that there were architectural benefits from even increased OS-level parallelism via multitasking for even basic stuff like terminal handling: One of the reasons the Amigas felt so fast for its time was that the OS pretty consistently traded total throughput for reduced latency by removing blocking throughout. E.g. the terminal/shell windows on the Amiga typically involved half a dozen tasks (Amiga threads/processes - no MMU so not really a distinction) at a minimum: one to handle keyboard and mouse inputs, one &quot;cooking&quot; the raw events into higher level events and responding to low level requests for windowing updates, one handling higher level events and responding with things like cursor movements,  the shell itself, one mediating cut and paste requests (which again would involved multiple other tasks to store the cut/copied data to the clipboard device (which would usually be mapped on top of a ram disk, but could be put on any filesystem - potentially involving even more separate tasks))<p>Many of the &quot;primitives&quot; of that kind of architecture can be offloaded:<p>The process appears largely sequential, but it has numerous points where it&#x27;s possible to do things in parallel, and more importantly: even sequential operations can be <i>interleaved</i> to a large extent, so you can start processing later events sooner. Many contemporary systems appeared laggy in comparison despite higher <i>throughput</i> because AmigaOS interleaved so many operations by processing smaller subsets of the total processing in small slices in many individual tasks. While you can do that by simply taking the CPU away from a bigger tasks doing everything in parallel, that takes control over the &quot;chunking&quot; away from the developer. I did some work on the AROS (AmigaOS reimplementation) console handling a few years back, and it was amazing how much difference tuning the interactions between those components affected responsiveness (running on the same single core of an x86 box).<p>The limit is whether 1) you can do things faster (reduce latency) - if you can do things faster with offloading, it&#x27;s a candidate, 2) if your main CPU has other stuff it can do while waiting, if so, you have a candidate.<p>Consider the complex font engines we run these days, for example. Prime candidate for offloading, because it&#x27;s largely a pipeline: &quot;Put this text here rendered with this font&quot;, and we usually render a lot of text with a small set of fonts. We treat it as a sequential task when we usually we can interleave it with other work and just need to be able to have sequencing points where we say &quot;don&#x27;t return until all the rendering tasks are complete&quot;.<p>We can do this with multi-core architectures, but it&#x27;s hard to do it <i>efficiently</i> without extremely cheap context switches (which are hard to do if you do it as a user-level task running under a memory protected general purpose OS), and we rarely want to dedicate cores of our big expensive CPUs to tasks like that.<p>Have an array of cheap, wimpy cores, and it becomes a different calculation.",1418381069

After all, healthy people do not have chronic conditions whereas the obese & smokers can spend 20-40 years being treated for hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, arthritis, emphysema, COPD, etc. How could people living, on average, an extra four to seven years without such chronic care possibly wind up costing more? As it turns out, the study you reference was not based on data from actual patient outcomes but is a mathematical model: <a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050029"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fj...</a><p>David Strip calls into question the validity of the model thusly:<p><i>&quot;Much in line with the response by Mittendorf, the validity of the results lies very strongly on key assumptions that are not demonstrated. The analysis assumes that the cost of an incidence of the 22 key diseases is independent of the risk factors being tested. Likewise, remaining health care costs, which account for 85% of health-care spending in the Netherlands , are assumed to be uncorrelated to risk factors. Given that this latter class of spending dwarfs the former, the importance of demonstrating the lack of correlation is particularly important. The incidence of numerous co-morbidities with obesity argues, in fact, that one might reasonably expect to find that the annual health costs are higher in the obese and that the cost of treatment in the last months preceding death may be quite different from the non-obese.</i><p>Kim McPherson, emeritus professor of public health at Oxford, wrote in response to the van Baal study here: <a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050037"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fj...</a><p><i>In a sense, Van Baal and colleagues&#x27; study is a useful antidote to current concerns. But let us be clear: it does not attenuate them. Obese people cost less because individuals die younger and hence with less chronic morbidity associated with old age. This is a useful thing to know, but how might it affect public health strategies for obesity? In particular, does it mean that concerns about increasing population obesity are misplaced, as least as far as health-service costs are concerned?<p>Sadly not. Examine an obese population and a lean population of the same age and sex distribution, and the former will incur far greater health-care costs throughout the life course. Much more diabetes, and more cardiovascular disease and cancer will occur amongst the obese—even amongst the older obese [3]. Compare health-care costs now with those thirty years ago, and—holding everything but obesity constant—the current population costs much more to the health sector than it did then [4]. Moreover, quite apart from health-care costs, the other costs to society from obesity are also greater because of absences from work due to illness and employment difficulties; these costs amount to considerably more than health-care costs [5]. It is not clear that these extra costs are intrinsically related to health-care costs, but they are currently estimated to be around four times as great in obese than in lean people [5].</i>",1418379747

And that&#x27;s where I think the difference is between rich and poor; yes, there are networking differences, yes, there are differences in local crime rate and other environmental stressors and so on, but the biggest factor is motivation.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a peer ditch school to go to the library to use public terminals, back at the time when computers still weren&#x27;t that popular, and there was no Google or Wikipedia. But even then I could see that some people have a different heart -- starting from an early age, they had a yearning to learn that surpassed the praises of parents or the soothing structure of school.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t access. The access is already <i>intense</i> for rich and poor alike. Most people don&#x27;t possess the psychological traits to pursue their own intellectual growth. Almost everyone I&#x27;ve met, rich or poor, stop learning when society stops pressuring them. They may have high or low IQ, be rich or poor, but they are not interested in self-directed learning, at least not without strong external reasons like parents or social shame.<p>Almost everyone is not an intellectual.",1418378849

Very few people use them in that fashion.<p>The iMac has a 5K display. The Mac Pro has two high-power GPUs. These are not server features because they&#x27;re designed to provide explosive graphics power for a single user at a time. Using &#x27;80s terminology, both those Apple computers would qualify as workstations, IMO...<p>I think an interesting analogy could be made with physical training. Some athletes train for endurance, e.g. running a marathon. Others train for muscle strength, e.g. powerlifting.<p>A server is an &quot;endurance-oriented computer&quot; -- its power needs to be distributed evenly over multiple active sessions. One remote client can&#x27;t be allowed to hobble the server.<p>In contrast, a client is a &quot;strength-oriented computer&quot;. For much of the time, it&#x27;s sitting idle because the human in front of it is so slow.

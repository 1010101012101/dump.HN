But sharecroppers?<p>Sharecroppers didn&#x27;t &quot;choose&quot; to move away from the south. They were basically poor uneducated people without any other form of work available to them. A good portion of them were the direct descendents of slaves who used to work the same land in the same way. They lost their indentured servitude when they became obsoleted by the mechanization of farming. There were no other jobs in the area, but as luck would have it, a big push for more industrial workers was happening in the north and west.<p>That&#x27;s not some kind of &quot;admirable trait&quot;. They had no choice but to go find work elsewhere, and were lucky to find it. You don&#x27;t have to be an economist to figure out that today, people aren&#x27;t going to be spending lots of money they don&#x27;t have to move around the country for jobs that don&#x27;t exist.<p>We live in a global marketplace now, and almost all of our exports are things machines assemble for us. Unskilled labor is shrinking fast. Our economy is weak. Our government is hobbled. Our education sucks. Our healthcare gets exponentially more expensive. The only incentive I can think of to move is for educated people to move toward centers of white-collar business for the remaining and new jobs, and maybe gentrification away from expensive metropolises people can no longer afford.<p>So yeah, NYT, we&#x27;re not going anywhere.",1387177077

6913279,comment,6912198,6913004,2,0,waps,,,"Let&#x27;s think this through ... how much would they pay more ? Well, for most unrewarding jobs I think you&#x27;ll find that labor costs dominate. So any wage rise needs to be reflected in the cost of those services ... which results in a need for more money (since cost rises in basic goods will disproportionally affect poor people, resulting in the need for further basic income rises)<p>So it&#x27;s obvious there is a feedback loop here. Basic income -> price hikes -> more basic income -> more price hikes ... The question is what multiplier we have between the steps. If that number is << 1 (much smaller than one) ... then no problem. If it&#x27;s anywhere near 1, basic income will result in total devastation of the economy.<p>There are jobs that would be affected more than others. Elderly care, for example, is a very dirty, very unrewarding job. With basic income it&#x27;ll become completely impossible to pay for. So that looks to me a very basic tradeoff : you can have one of these : elderly<p>And that is a consequence that&#x27;s very unlikely to be appreciated by either rich or poor.",1387176932

While they are dishonestly marketing that stuff as &quot;buying&quot; media, in reality you&#x27;re just indefinitely renting it, and could lose it at any time. This is why I recommend to never exchange money for individual titles like this - if you&#x27;re going to pay for DRM&#x27;d streams, at least pay for something like Netflix that rents out its whole catalog for one (monthly) price.<p>The saddest thing about this whole ordear is that, generally speaking, you can&#x27;t even genuinely buy digital video - as-in, you can&#x27;t buy DRM-free downloads. The only way to actually own something is to either buy a physical copy and strip it of DRM or to pirate it, and that&#x27;s a sad state of being.

Disney in particular has arguably the most valuable content portfolio in the world and has tremendous influence. If Amazon, Apple, and Google didn&#x27;t want the terms, the licenses wouldn&#x27;t have been struck, and we&#x27;d probably be shopping for these kinds of videos at atrocities like imedia.disney.com and sony-evideostation.com.<p>The only reason why this is happening is because online sales is still a very small portion of their total revenue. Check out slide #31 of this deck [x]. EST = electronic sell-through (&quot;buying&quot; a movie/show), and it&#x27;s completely dwarfed by the other channels. (FYI: BD=Blu-Ray, VoD/PPV = cable rentals). So rights holders can screw over their tiny, small-revenue user base in exchange to keep the larger ones happy and profitable.<p>Also, the consumer reaction will be largely inelastic. No matter how bitter Corey Doctorow is bitter at Amazon and Disney, he&#x27;s going to still going to buy/rent/pirate the content because his kids will want to watch it. This is why Disney is so powerful.<p>In the next decade or so, as consumers continue to shift their viewing habits, we&#x27;ll start seeing the options be more consumer-friendly and probably cheaper. Remember it took the music industry 10-15 years from the rise of MP3s to today&#x27;s DRM-free iTunes, VEVO, and Spotify options.

6913166,comment,6910687,6910687,4,0,mcgwiz,,,"TLDR: Don&#x27;t worry. We have civil liberties orientation. You can trust us.<p>The author understands their is a misconception at play, but it&#x27;s not that the public thinks NSA agents aren&#x27;t upstanding or law-abiding, it&#x27;s that NSA agents think their idea idea of patriotism is broad enough. It&#x27;s telling that he dismissed an examination of patriotism, because that&#x27;s the root of so much discord over civil liberties and national security.<p>There are two major currents of patriotism in this country. The first is that we take pride in our accomplishments, and we must defend our borders, protect our treasure and lives, and maintain the status quo. The second is more idealistic, that we take pride in having an open (vulnerable, ever-changing) society, and we must defend our democratic identity, promote participation, protect individual freedom, and be skeptical of concentrations of power. The first is practical, easy to quantify (and therefore appealing to a data-thirsty culture). The second is strategic, asks more from the average citizen, and rests on an understanding of alternative forms of society (what is lost when we prioritize security and order over those &quot;inalienable&quot; rights).<p>Ideally, the NSA would be staffed by patriots of the second type. They&#x27;d embrace &#x27;public service&#x27; as having deep reverence for the public (not just their physical safety, but their liberties as well), that appreciates the philosophical underpinning of democracy (including it&#x27;s necessitation of vulnerability and cultural evolution), and that prides itself in taking on their intelligence goals while ardently building checks and balances. They&#x27;d never just ask how they can get the information, but how it can be done in a way that proudly upholds American values. With bureaucracy you&#x27;ll always have some amount of inefficiency and misalignment with top-level goals, but a pervasive culture can go along way.",1387173772

They could have interviewed anyone outside of the NSA skeptical of their practices and spliced together numerous views. They could have asked hard questions and then shown NSA&#x27;s refusal to answer them. And this whole piece was very light on facts. I kept expecting a voiceover of the journalist to explain how the NSA&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t match the facts leaked.

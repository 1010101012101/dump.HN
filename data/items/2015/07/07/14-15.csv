The scenarios ignore basic facts about humans and technology. The simple fact is humans are resourceful and criminals have proven to be very dedicated.<p>Consider two things,<p>a) Regarding:<p>> in particular, it would take a lot to convince me that private ownership of assault rifles is anything but bad news.<p>The technological different between an &#x27;assault rifle&#x27; and a semi-automatic hunting rifle is very small. As Cody Wilson has demonstrated, with a few 3d-printed parts you can turn a simple rifle - which is already restricted by law from being an assault rifle - into a fully blown assault rifle with a relatively small amount of technical knowledge.<p>The same was true for decades with anyone with metal machining skills.<p>So how much of a difference will it make if the tech available is merely restricted and not banned? If you can easily modified the technology?<p>b) The proposed encryption laws must insist that they <i>won&#x27;t</i> interfere with American corporations from creating, selling, and exporting encryption to valid purchasers. The development of better-and-better encryption will not stop. It will still be one of Americas greatest exported technologies. An industry the US dominates (software).<p>So now taking that into consideration, will it be feasible to stop criminals from getting access to encryption?<p>Similar to encryption, America is the largest exporter of weapons in the world - unlike the UK or Scandinavian countries.<p>The simple fact is that there will be a huge market of both weapons and people (with specialized-skills) which will leak their guns/knowledge onto the black market. Combine that with the internet and decentralized tech and you have a very challenging regulation environment.<p>At best, it will be become yet another &#x27;arms race&#x27; between criminals/police that is ultimately a net-negative investment for society (see: drugs).",1436281139

In the 20th century, the only bad social engineering event I can think of that could even remotely be considered the outgrowth of a broad movement of the masses is sort of Nazi-ism. Everything else was led by somebody with an idea from academia. &quot;The masses&quot; don&#x27;t originate many ideas, and in the era of the all-powerful State (which the 20th century is firmly in), &quot;the masses&quot; don&#x27;t run around committing genocide, or doing any of the things they may have done in previous social systems, because all that power is now reserved to the State.<p>And the State and academia have <i>always</i> been attached at the hip, as they are today.

As a result of the severely restricted supply, they&#x27;re very expensive and rather rare. But even before the registry was closed to civilians, registered machineguns were only used in a handful of crimes since they were regulated in 1934.<p>In the US, there is a pattern of politicians pushing for their pet gun control measures after some mass shooting, regardless of whether or not it would have stopped the incident that justifies the legislative push. The most recent example is the reaction to the Charleston church shooting, where some politicians pushed for an &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban (which is political term about cosmetics—these are not machineguns) and background checks for private party sales, despite the shooter not using a weapon that would have been covered by the proposed ban, purchased from a licensed gun dealer after passing a standard background check. While universal background checks are arguably a good thing regardless of what motivated the push, the &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban is pure political nonsense. Such guns are almost never used in crime and previous bans were shown to not have any effect on crime. When a gun is used in a crime, it is almost always a handgun.",1436280986

Are there any good examples of when and where to use Docker over something like OpenVZ?<p>Docker is exactly like OpenVZ. It became popular because they really emphasize their OpenVZ Application Templates feature, and made it much more user friendly.<p>So users of Docker, instead of following this guide: <a href=""https://openvz.org/Application_Templates"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openvz.org/Application_Templates</a><p>They write a Dockerfile, which in a simple case might be:<p><pre><code>    FROM nginx\n    COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html\n</code></pre>\nSo no fuzzing with finding a VE somewhere, downloading it customizing it, and then installing stuff manually, stopping the container and tarring it, Docker does that all for you when you run `docker build`.<p>Then you can push your nice website container to the public registry, ssh to your machine and pull it from the registry. Of course you can have your own private registry (we do) so you can have proprietary docker containers that run your apps/sites.<p>From my perspective, the answer to your question would be: Always prefer Docker over OpenVZ, they are the same technology but Docker is easier to use.<p>But I&#x27;ve never really invested in OpenVZ so maybe there&#x27;s some feature that Docker doesn&#x27;t have.",1436280615

9845753,comment,9843654,9843654,0,0,danharaj,,,"I&#x27;d much rather prefer to lurk Hacker News but these comment chains have just been so exasperating.<p>I&#x27;d like to know how many people actually believe that science is engaged in a widespread effort to dissimulate the truth of sex differences? Everyone knows that there is a sexual dimorphism in humans. It&#x27;s not that pronounced compared to other species. Our dimorphism is not anomalous amongst great apes, nor is it indicative of much: Our closest relatives are Chimpanzees and Bonobos where the former form hierarchical male dominated communities while the latter form egalitarian communities.<p>Let me ask some questions just as an efficient way of throwing up historical and social context. These questions are rhetorical and aren&#x27;t even the best questions to ask. I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time thinking up the best questions. I think a few examples are enough to convey the general line of inquiry I&#x27;d like to show is possible.<p>Do the differences between humans caused by sexual variation account for the structure of our society? If yes, when did this become the case? Was it the case in 1800 United States of America when married women could not own property? Was that caused by some sort of sex-linked genetic variation?<p>Was it the case in the 1940&#x27;s when lobotomies were in vogue, and most of the operations performed were on women? Do women have some sort of sex-linked genetic flaw that leads to brains that need to be lobotomized?<p>Is the nuclear family a primordial family unit optimized for the innate sex-linked variations between humans that form viable reproductive pairings, or is it optimized for the division of labor and capital of bourgeois society?<p>When exactly were the unimpeachable doctrines of male supremacy promulgated by law, church, and capitalism purged from our consciousnesses, our institutions, our social networks, our education centers, our philosophy, our _science_ so that society immediately restructured along more _objective_ lines where all individuals realize their full potential and enter into the social relationships most suitable to their essential nature?<p>Because that is the subtext that speckles this page. That male supremacy was banished from human reason and what remains is a hegemony based on some _rational_ _objectively verifiable_ sex-linked variation that is unimpeachable by human means. The power structures in which this truth is intelligible, that verifies and reproduces this truth is left implicit, because it is normalized in so many social groups, HN intersecting with a great many of them. I don&#x27;t think I am capable of deconstructing this logic, but I will just throw out my conjecture:<p>This is the neoliberal paradigm squaring its beliefs in the free market, meritocracy, minimal governance, the free flow and concentration of capital, dissimulation of relations of power, the privatization of ever more institutions, the application of market rationality to all spheres of human activity, an epistemology based on private institutions and capitals competing in a market of ideas, and the refusal to regard as legitimate any theory that posits power structures and modes of truth that do not follow analytically from these doctrines, with systemic inequality. The cause _must be_ the sublimation of truth from the market of _free_ individuals pursuing their rational self-interest, where the market and the pursuits it comprises _define_ truth.<p>As a last note, I don&#x27;t think I am familiar with much feminist theory that tries to dissimulate sexual differences. In fact, many feminists would probably agree that the most significant and easily verifiable sex-linked variation between people accounts for a great deal of interpersonal inequality between men and women: Men are bigger and stronger and thus have an easier time getting what they want through personal violence. But this is in fact a minor point. There have been a great many societies on this Earth, in spite of their systematic obliteration and assimilation throughout the years, ever accelerating to meet the hunger of capitalist societies for new places and peoples to put on the market. They have had varying levels of equity between people-- there are even non-binary systems of gender, and their existence ought to pique and interest to critically examine the cultural institutions that separate and regulate the biopolitical realities of people in bourgeois society.<p>Feminist theory, by and large, especially the theories of leftist feminists (none of that bourgeois, liberal crap) emphasize systemic inequality, not interpersonal variation. They certainly don&#x27;t need to resort to such minutiae when so much effective theory and action has been executed against institutionally imposed male supremacy. It seems that it is a tenacious enemy though. Once it can no longer reproduce itself along certain power structures (e.g. church) it will find ways through more contemporarily legitimate power structures (e.g. neoliberal rationality).",1436280380

However the difference between docker image and openVZ images is the inclusion of an init system.<p>> Have to disagree here, primarily because each service should live in each own container, docker is a process container, not a system container. Assemble a system out of several containers, don&#x27;t mash it all up into one - most people don&#x27;t seem to get this about docker.<p>I understand your point,<p>I much prefer each service having an IP that is registered to DNS. This means that I can hit up service.datacenter.company.com and get a valid service. (using well tested dns load balancing and health checks to remove or re-order individual nodes)<p>Its wonderfully transparent and doesn&#x27;t require a special custom service discovery in both the client and service. because like etcd it has the concept of scope you can find local instances trivially. using DCHP you can say connect servicename and let dhcpd set your scope for you.<p>> None is required. Containers are ephemeral and generally don&#x27;t need to be migrated, they are simply destroyed and started where needed. Requiring &#x27;hot migration&#x27; in the docker universe generally means you are doing it wrong. Not to say that there is no place for that.<p>This I have to disagree with you. For front end type applications, ones that hold no state, you are correct.<p>However for anything that requires shared state, or data its a bad thing. Take your standard database cluster ([no]SQL or whatever) of 5 machines. You are running at 80% capacity, and one of your hosts is starting to get overloaded. You can kill a node, start up a warm node on a fresh machine.<p>However now you are running at 100% capacity, and you now need to take some bandwidth to bring up a node to get back to 80%. Running extra machines for the purpose of allowing CPU load balancing aggrieves me.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating writing apps that cannot be restarted gracefully. I&#x27;m also not arguing against ephemeral containers, its more a case of easy load balancing, and disaster migration. Hot migration means that software is genuinely decoupled from the hardware.",1436279963

When writes happen, they&#x27;re performed on the new VHD, and reads have to use both the main and the snapshot VHD. And you can create a chain of snapshots, each pointing to the previous snapshot, for versioning.

If you need to vary the number of, say, web servers from 5 to 100 over the day, then Docker is good because you can start them up very quickly.<p>The down side about docker is that it takes longer to set up your docker in the first place, it is harder to keep secure, and it runs slower than a traditionally deployed application, but compared to VM deployed applications the performance is usually better.",1436277662
9845460,comment,9843654,9845165,0,0,0624213997,,,"I&#x27;m a female computer scientist / developer, and after my experience both online, at school, and at work, I would really just rather ignore it. I went to a college with 4:1 ratio of male to female.<p>I&#x27;ve had periods in my life where I felt like I was the beautiful princess at the school, and periods where I feel like a somewhat disfigured monster with an average intellect. It really sucks when culture places so much emphasis on appearance, and I don&#x27;t have that when I engage in dialogue and activity online.<p>The fact that I&#x27;ve been able to think about this since I was maybe 14 years old, on a hypothetical and applicative level, shows that there is more that varies to predicting individual differences than what these tests measure, and what causes are inferred, as the act of measuring may change the outcome. Males may take more risks because culture rewards them if they do, supposedly, and I as a female have sought stability, predictability and consistency in my education. When people are trying very hard to either sleep with you, hit on you, or even screw with you (because for some reason, your existence bothers them), it&#x27;s very hard to know whether you are learning the truth, or whether the truth has been distorted, made easier to swallow, or prepackaged otherwise, because of your teachers&#x27; and classmates&#x27; perceptive biases.<p>I take a lot of risks in learning. I try to avoid taking those risks in real life, because while at one point, I did, I found myself on the precipice of losing almost everything.<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly, that the individual is different from the aggregate. But even myself, I am a hypocrite, because these are cynical inferences I made along the way, about my education, while I was receiving it. And I made those inferences mostly from having a behind the curtain peek into boys clubs, online. I was judging my classmates and peers by assholes on the internet, and that really isn&#x27;t right, but neither is it right to assume that a person fits on the distributive curve of which they can be categorized into, based on a very small subselection of data.<p>Thinking about this has led me to the conclusion, that I really don&#x27;t know a lot of things, and it seems neither does anyone else. Every point in time can be as unpredictable as infinity. People make so many assumptions about what is stuffed up in other people&#x27;s heads, what guides how they think, what they do with that knowledge, how it directs them, and the resulting thoughts, the determination of envisioning, assisting, and planning the life paths of others.<p>My greatest comfort level is being an anonymous blob with no face, on the internet, where I learn a little bit of haskell here and there, and maybe find some elegant nuance and subtlety in code, computational theory, mathematics, philosophy. It&#x27;s a bit hypocritical for me to share my gender willingly, over and over, but at this rate, I go through probably hundreds of aliases in a year.<p>Thank you though, for clarifying an important point concisely. The last time sex differences came up on a forum, I don&#x27;t remember feeling quite so calm.",1436277657
9845459,comment,9843389,9844499,0,0,PavlovsCat,,,"I have a huge problem with the word troll. Call me oldschool, but to me a troll is someone who claims to believe something when they really don&#x27;t, and that just can never be proven either way. So why even go there? Trolls just like anyone else make statements, those statements are either off-topic or can be dealt with. If they&#x27;re very aggressive, or just wrong in their claims, there is no need for the additional charge &quot;troll&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t feed distractions&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t feed negativity&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t waste time on this, it&#x27;s red herring because [insert solid argument here]&quot;, having rules for accepted behaviour, those and more all work perfectly fine, and they have the added benefit of not making someone an unperson with the word &quot;troll&quot;.<p>The author(s) really just could put two things they said in separate places together:<p>> Mob mentalities seize hold of &quot;the villian of the moment&quot;, and no person has any incentive to stick up for someone who is the &#x27;bad guy du jour&#x27; of the crowd, regardless of whether or not all claims are merited.<p>and<p>> With dewDrop, those making the baseless charges can just be denied, with the subject issuing a DISTRUST statement. Anyone who trusts the subject can now immediately know to distrust those issuing the baseless claims - as well as anyone who trusted them.<p>... surely you can see how the combination of those two things could be a problem, right? I mean, what is a &quot;baseless claim&quot;, who gets to decide that, and how?<p>I&#x27;ve been baselessly called a troll before simply because my claims were NOT baseless, and I asked others to back up their claims about me. And the best bit is, the FB page admin let that thread exist as long as someone else calling me a troll had the last word; but when I replied, insisting that just calling someone names does not constitute addressing what they said, and that my points stand, the whole thread got deleted like 30 mins later, and I had to fish the whole comment thread out of a browser process dump with a hex editor because I was so dumbfounded.<p>In my eyes then and now, I wasn&#x27;t trolling, I was throwing pearls to pigs; I posted a &quot;wall of text&quot; which I had indeed thought about quite a bit in a forum where 99% of all responses to anything ever posted is just &quot;you&#x27;re doing a great job, keep it up, it would be so great if everybody was aware that you&#x27;re just so great&quot;. Which is not even something I disagree with, I just wanted to <i>add</i> to that :/ But oh well, I was banned from posting too, though that I only realized weeks later when I pondered wether to translate something for that page, because they asked for volunteers.<p>So.. sure, I can flag a whole page with ten thousands of likes as &quot;they all suck at reading comprehension, admin may even be dishonest&quot;, but where would the fact that I can back my claim up, and they can&#x27;t, that I&#x27;m the one fishing that stuff out of memory which they swept under the rug, fit in there? What if I don&#x27;t want to flag a whole page? What if I think someone is absolutely wrong about topic A, or for some reasons unable to learn, but has no stake in topic B, or is intellectually honest about it even though they do?<p>Sorry for rambling, but the anecdote I described actually did hurt me a bit when it happened. It&#x27;s the discussion equivalent of getting killed by a drone without trial, simply not cool. Now imagine one &quot;trusted admin&quot; being able to simply delete the voice of people from this vague group of everybody representing &quot;human progress&quot;... ugh!<p>It&#x27;s tricky over the web, but in person, the idea is generally, the more healthy and sane you are yourself, the easier you notice the bad &quot;vibrations&quot; others send out. It&#x27;s just we usually are all over the place or unhappy ourselves, but the less you are, the easier you notice the patterns and disguises around you. And while we don&#x27;t have pheromones and body language and a lot of other things over the web, I do feel something more limited but similar applies there too, it just can&#x27;t be formalized easily and tattooed to people&#x27;s foreheads or user ID, just like we can&#x27;t do that with character, sanity, intelligence, knowledge, and all the other things that go into the one word &quot;trust&quot;.<p>&quot;I trust this person&quot; is just one simple word for something you could not fully describe in a book. I trust various people to various degrees, each relation is completely unique, and I cannot easily or at all transfer my experiences with a person in one area to another area. I would also never say &quot;Oh, you need a (dis)trust relationship with person X you never met? Here, just copy mine&quot;. It&#x27;s like I wouldn&#x27;t make a copy of my toothbrush for them, I&#x27;d rather help them get their own. Of course that&#x27;s not entirely true, we gossip and criticize or laud others in their absence all the time, and we take that into account; but I would rarely let that keep me from getting to know a person, at least from even getting a first impression of my own. I know people do that, but I consider it harmful.<p>If anything, the very idea that someone would rather talk about the person who said something, than what they said, would count <i>against</i> them in my books. I&#x27;d say &quot;the&quot; (any) mob itself is standing in the way of its own progress, the appeal to authority or current consensus, sometimes expressed in just numbers, and always coming with labels. To put a point on it, the problem is that too many people can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to think for themselves or examine evidence, not how to do it for them (kinda like IMHO the problem is also that people don&#x27;t configure the software they use or read manuals, not <i>just</i> what the best default setup or tutorial would be). Tools can help people reach maturity, but they cannot replace maturity, which to me implies such things as critical thinking and <i>climbing</i> that &quot;hierarchy of disagreement&quot;, instead of getting stuck in one of the lower floors.<p>Last but not least, either you require each physical human to have just one root identity, or you already have lost to anyone willing to make more than one account, if not hundreds. If it can be done it will be done, if it can lead to influencing what people vote or buy, doubly so. This already happens, sure, it would just be more of that, but the more it was trusted the worse it could be abused.<p>If you read this far, thanks, and apologies :)",1436277633

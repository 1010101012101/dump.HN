With a pseudoname, this was not an issue.

2843572,comment,2843442,2843442,2,0,jeffremer,,,"I went to a talk given by the Meebo founders about what to consider when designing your front page. A big part of the talk boiled down to making a single call to action very clear and tailoring it toward the majority of users that are going to hit your front page.<p>Your call to action is very clear, ""Try it Free"" (I'm assuming you're going to make it so that the content on the left of the slideshow/carousel doesn't fade in and out). I think this is a Good Thing (tm).<p>It seems clear that your goal is to convert new users who land on your home page. I'm guessing the decision between login form versus link has to do with a compromise between conversions and engagement.<p>That said, without a way for an existing user to find their way back in your engagement is going to suffer dramatically - <i>unless</i> going to your homepage is not the primary way your users access the app. So you obviously need at least a link to sign in.<p>Deciding whether or not to include a form over a link depends entirely on how much you want to push for engagement over conversion. Your homepage is pretty clean (not a lot of noise), so perhaps there's room for a login form eventually - but since I assume your initial goal is conversions then I'd start with the link.<p>You can optimize for engagement by making ""remember me"" the default for logins and then taking logged in users directly to their dashboard when they hit the homepage.<p>For non-cookied users you could also A/B test the homepage with a link or with a form and then see if you are getting drop off in either conversions or engagement from having one or the other.",1312412168

2843565,comment,2840543,2840543,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Voxels have a bad reputation in the graphics community. Back when I was absorbed in this and writing my 3D 'engine' I got to see this debate in its infancy.<p>There is an intermediate form, non-uniform rational b-splines or NURBs, which the first nVidia card rendered directly. That made it possible for the NV1 graphics card to render a perfect sphere with just 6 NURBs vs triangle based engines which required dozens if not hundreds of triangles to approach the visual quality of that sphere.<p>Of course 3Dfx (and Matrox, and NEC with their PowerVR architecture) made triangle engines, they needed fewer gates and had far easier texturing pipelines. Once the NV1 was retired I haven't seen hardware NURB support re-emerge (although it would make for a wonderful thing given a multi-billion transistor GPU).<p>Voxels make the argument that once you get below the oversamping fraction of a pixel, be it 1, 4, or 16, you don't need a complex structure. And while geometry culling using a z-buffer and clipping rectangle is well trod, voxel culling has some subtleties that make it more challenging.<p>Voxels have, to date, over promised and under delivered.<p>Notch's analysis is pretty much spot on, with one minor exception, the math. Just like polygon engines don't bother creating layers of polygons to represent solids, a voxel 'rock' or other solid doesn't need to represent the 'inside' with voxels, it only needs to represent the surface of the solid to a degree where you can't see between the voxels. As long as voxel resolution is comfortably above the pixel resolution of the 2D project plane (aka the screen). So lots of data to represent surfaces, but they can be 1 'atom' thick so less than the petabytes he supposed.<p>Rendering then is the process of taking a rectangular solid which is 1x1 pixel at the screen surface and then expands based on the field of view out from the eye, and once you've gone deep enough into the geometry such that the cross section parallell to the screen has no gaps, you can compute and render that pixel and move on. And, as the Euclideon people point out, since you're not really doing polygons at all, changing the 'complexity' (in terms of surfaces) on the scene doesn't change either the render time or the effective voxel count.<p>Yes, its pretty abusive of memory bandwidth, since at range the number of voxels that have to be looked at to fill a single pixel can be large. Imagine a 747 airplane flying across the sky at a visual 35,000', if its only 2 x 3 pixels by the time it renders, its still made up of potentially billions of voxels which form the surface you can see.",1312412092

2843562,comment,2840440,2843261,1,0,rpearl,,,"No, my argument is that the point is moot. If a task_struct on linux does not trigger an address space switch it is a thread. While to the kernel they are (regrettably) the same entity, they still have relevant performance characteristics of windows {process, thread}; the difference in cost is the cost of switching address spaces.\nThat cost appears in either operating system. If there is any difference from the way Windows handles threads it is simply negligible in terms of this benchmark.",1312412065
2843561,comment,2841414,2842581,1,0,reinhardt,,,"I can think of at least two opposite mindsets:<p>A. On the one end, one optimizes for overall expected yield. There's no finite target, the goal is ""as much as possible"". With this objective, walking away from a lot of low-risk money for much less and high-risk is much harder. Similarly, the lower the starting point, the more open you are to take up risk because you don't have much to lose anyway.<p>B. On the other end, one has specific targets. Once these targets are met, money ceases to be a decision criterion. With this frame, it is actually <i>easier</i> to walk away from a lot of money after you have achieved X, Y and Z.<p>These are simplified extremes of course, in reality it's a mix of both and shifts over time, but it goes to show that there's no single ""correct"" answer.",1312412024

Every company would be granted full license to use these patents, as long as they commit not to sue anyone else (in or out of the pool) for patent infringement.  Ideally, they would commit their own patents to the pool as well.<p>With enough buy-in, this could effectively null out software patents without any legislative change, at least among non-trolls, since with a large enough pool it would be almost guaranteed that a company would violate more patents in the pool than vice-versa.<p>Ideally, this pool would be managed by a non-profit institution, patents would be committed irrevocably, and the  organization would have lawyers to actually sue any other company that filed a patent lawsuit.  This may be similar to what's been done for WebM etc., but it seems like the same idea on this much larger scale could be much more powerful.<p>Main challenges I could see are (1) patent trolls, since there's nothing to sue them for, and (2) who decides what's a software patent -- not sure how clear-cut of a line this is.",1312411788

Now take that idea and make it part of the language: header files. You have to declare every method in the source file, and then again, in the header file.<p>That at least made some sense for C, because header files were small, compared to source files. Only a few key methods needed to be in the header files. Now take C++: the entire class declaration has to be in the header file, including all the private methods. Now every source file has to parse a much greater amount of header files.<p>For bonus points, don't change the rule that a header file can be included multiple times, with multiple different active #defines. So you cant optimize that.<p>Then, even if you do start using microsoft specific #pragma's, of compiler-recognizable #ifdef MYFILE_H #define MYFILE_H, these files can still render different syntax trees between different source files, so you can't parse them one per project.<p>Then, introduce templates. Basically, remove the need for a source file at all, and declare that huge reams of code will actually be in header files. Bonus: dont declare a new form of source file, just keep using header files for this, again with the rules that the same header file (of templates) can mean multiple different things in any given source file, despite the fact that this is guaranteed to Not Do You What You Expect even if you were foolish enough to do it.<p>The only template ""improvement"" in C++0x is ""extern templates"", which is basically a huge goddam hack that says to the compiler ""look I know you've had to parse+comprehend this template code for every single source file but please dont actually generate the machine code in my object file"".<p>Finally, get together and decide that of all the things fucked up about C++, its the lack of <i>threading</i> support that is the big problem for us all. Seriously?<p>There isn't any way to make Visual C++ ""efficient"" because it compiles C++. Likewise, ""modern"". If you mean ""efficient"" for typing / editing, then I'd recommend you have a look at Visual SlickEdit (if you are the IDE type) and even then you will be light years behind what a modern IDE can do with a modern language.",1312410075

It was a better feature phone OS. After the iPhone came out, Google changed courses and counterfeited the iPhone.<p>If google wanted to compete, they could have spent 7 years investing in fundamental innovations-- like Apple did with touch-- to create their own new UI. Maybe they could have done a voice driven phone. OR, if touch was inevitable, they could have done their own, innovative take on touch UIs.<p>They did not. They turned around and cloned the iPhone and then gave the OS away for free.""<p>Fundamentally incorrect; the T-Mobile G1 running Android 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 (with modification), did, in fact, come with its own user interface, utilizing widgets on the home pages, wallpapers before iOS was even capable of such a thing unjailbroken, and a different method by which the applications are accessed -- those particular elements are present to this day in Android software. Notably, it wasn't until 2.x that the G1 gained multitouch. Back then, Android's home screen metaphor more resembled the standard desktop of a computer than anything else -- of course, with the addition of widgets. On top of everything else, Android did notifications in a brand new way -- in fact, in a way that was so innovative, Apple ripped them off in iOS 5!<p>Also, in 2.x, Android gained the feature of dynamic image wallpaper -- i.e. ""live wallpapers"" -- where the wallpaper is quite dynamic. This is a feature Apple simply does not have yet.<p>Furthermore, there are different interface conventions in application design, different methods of application development -- in fact, an entirely different language with a platform-agnostic binary format, and, in general, different UI mechanisms for everything.<p>This is not even to mention copy & paste, which Android had before iOS proper did.<p>In short: they did not clone the iPhone nearly as much as you say they did. Manufacturers are the ones that did that later, with form factor.<p>""They were able to do this because the patent system requires Apple to publicly disclose their inventions. In exchange for this disclosure, Apple gets a monopoly on the use of their inventions. If you don't like this, that's fine, amend the constitution, and take it up with your congressman.""<p>Actually, just because Apple publicly disclosed their patent doesn't mean Google read the patent and purposely implemented anything exactly the same way Apple described. In fact, I'm absolutely positive that multitouch doesn't work quite the same way simply because the API to access touch is completely different. The end (user-facing) result winds up the same, though -- but the end result is what's at issue here, isn't it? To that end, I'd say, sure, multi-touch is copied -- but, there aren't a whole lot of common-sense ways, on a screen like that, to enlarge something (beyond buttons and such).<p>""Google is now claiming that the government should step in and use force-- that is, decrees backed by men with guns and the threat of violence-- to allow google to steal other companies innovations and get away with it.""<p>Blatant, incorrect hyperbole -- unless you can back up the ""use force"" part. No, the DoJ is stepping in because the major parties involved with the Nortel patent acquisition are also direct competitors with Google -- in fact, the parties are all the major mobile companies that <i>aren't</i> Google. These are companies that did <i>not</i> invent or patent the technologies themselves, but the patents are going to them and are potentially usable for the purpose of crushing Android with litigation rather than by the merit of the products themselves.<p>""Think about that. Google cannot compete fair and square, so they steal their competitors technology. When this is pointed out, they call for the use of violence to let them get away with it! Talk about Doing Evil!""<p>""They call for the use of violence"" -- citation needed. Honestly, the fact that <i>Google's</i> competitors seem to be (may not be, but the patent acquisition seems to be far more than coincidence here) colluding to squash Google by means of patent litigation is more evidence that Google's <i>competitors</i> can't compete ""fair and square"", that is, by technical merit.<p>""People only say 'anti-competitive' when someone is competing successfully and they don't like it.""<p>This sounds like something that would be strangely pro-Microsoft back when MS was abusing its monopoly... but a move to block new competition from entering a market, or a move to exclude (by disqualification) a very specific competitor seems pretty anti-competitive to me.<p>""Either way, Once again, Apple-- the only company in Silicon Valley with a track record of genuine innovation--""<p>Are you ignoring Facebook or something?

The remaining 11 map to either 30 days or 31 days . ie. 30+0, or 30+1.<p>3. So the object is to write a many-to-one function that maps some members of the set to 0, rest to 1. Add 30 and you get the right answer ie. number of days in that month.<p>4. So you want to map {1,3,5,7,8,10,12} to 1, and {4,6,9,11} to 0.<p>5. Write down a 13 bit number. If you rightshift x times and AND it with unity, you get 1.<p>6. So then, x belongs to {1,3,5,7,8,10,12}.<p>7. That means the bit in each of those locations must be on. The rest of the bits must be off. That gives you the number 1010110101010, which is simply 5546 in decimal.<p>8. So that's ((5546>>M)&1)+30, except for M==2.",1312409547

In such a situation it is in Nokia's self interest to use their immense patent portfolio to create a moat around their business to keep upstarts like Apple / Google away.<p>On the other hand lets consider another hypothetical situation where Nokia were innovating and trying to reimagine what a phone could be. Perhaps they were doing interesting things in software to displace desktops and make the phone the central location of the users global state. In this case they would be encroaching onto areas where other entities (like Microsoft, Google) might hold significant patents.

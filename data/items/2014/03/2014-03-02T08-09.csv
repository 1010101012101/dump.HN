I&#x27;m constantly using Relay and there is something magical about being able to instantly send a related GIF reaction to your friends. Every new GIF that pops up sends me head over heels. What is so powerful about this app is that it provides daily content, new GIFs, for users to enjoy. This makes it incredibly sticky as well as being able to share newly discovered GIFs to friends. It&#x27;s the newest way to communicate because very often text by itself can be misinterpreted. GIFs prevent that miscommunication by relaying personalized GIF reactions.<p>SnapChat has just become a dump of unwanted snaps. My thumb has better things to do than press and hold down to see food pics.",1393750581

This is a non-issue. 95% of what you read on Hacker News is essentially froth, the ephemera of technology. You can ignore it all. The problem is that technology is both your job and your hobby.<p>I had my first son when I was 22 (now 31), and my career has continued to go from strength to strength. There is adequate time in the evenings, or on commutes, to read and ponder, and I find time at work to investigate technologies that will have a positive effect on the business, because that&#x27;s my job. Since then I&#x27;ve learned three or four new languages, taught myself a whole bunch of crypo-stuff, got down with the Agile crowd, implemented machine learning and search techniques, and become a software architect.<p>I think you&#x27;d be surprised at how many employers would rather employ happily married young men with children, because they know that they&#x27;re less likely to be job hoppers; you might be right that early-stage startups are no longer a viable choice, though, unless you&#x27;re sure they&#x27;re going to be around for at least a couple of years.<p>Having said that, I joined my current company six years ago as employee number 5. It was founded by a mid-thirties guy with a wife and kids, who re-mortgaged his house to get the capital he needed.<p>Having children needn&#x27;t prevent you from doing meaningful and interesting things with your career, you just need to distinguish between what&#x27;s important, and what&#x27;s recreational. After a few months, once you and your wife have started to get a handle on this whole parenthood thing, you&#x27;ll find more time to do the things you love.<p>Of course, you might find that you&#x27;d rather spend the time playing with your kids :)",1393750384

7328345,comment,7327600,7328264,5,0,nieve,,,"I should have phrased that more clearly.  The cyberpunk thing is that we&#x27;ve got more aggressively open carrying and more dramaticly stupid shooting incidents like the string in Florida, very much the way a lot of cyberpunk has the trope of heavily armed idiots opening fire at the slightest excuse.  We have nothing like cyberpunk levels of violence and as you point out it&#x27;s mostly getting better, but we do have more incidents that&#x27;d fit nicely in a book than we used to and we have more people displaying weapons.  I&#x27;m thinking about the little color bits thrown into cyberpunk to clue the audience in and things like the Zimmerman, Dunn, and Reeves cases fit in perfectly with that (modulo actual human tragedy).",1393750336

7328343,comment,7324159,7324649,1,0,goggles99,,,"><i>Nonsense. People want to send their kids to the best schools because the best schools are the gatekeepers to the upper class. Someone who graduates from an Ivy League school gets to build a network with affluent alumni and has a high chance of landing a job that pays six-figures right off the bat. Someone who goes to a merely good state school though? There is a very good chance they won&#x27;t even find a job after graduation.</i><p>If this is the case then these people need to quit whining. It&#x27;s their choice - this is like saying that you need to mortgage your house to join a yacht or country club so you can make connections. Some people just have to work harder than others to make it, life isn&#x27;t fair cry me a river. Many people from cheaper institutions are better at making connections because they excel in the personality and charm dept (thus they have the advantage). Is that fair? Many poorer people make it big because they are smarter or luckier... Is that fair? Your argument just shows how blatantly ridiculous this is.<p>People are complaining that education is so expensive and yet they are going to the most expensive school is ridiculous.

Well let me correct myself, I didn&#x27;t mean to do that.<p>The single line while loop there is just bristling with pitfalls. I&#x27;d reject such code in code review and ask it to be rewritten in more readable C. As an added bonus, this exercise would probably also have caught the original bug that started this discussion.<p>The pass-by-value question came from someone who hadn&#x27;t written C code in years and I&#x27;m pretty sure a practicing C coder (in production code) would not have that question in the first place.

Your time will get further crunched with kids, but did you have enough time for everything pre-newborn? You have start-up ideas, why didn&#x27;t you work on those? Not enough time?<p>Maybe you just need more focus and better manage the time you have.<p>If you are a good engineer, then you will have a job. If not at your current employer, then somewhere else. Do the work for your employer at your job, not on your own time. This includes learning new things. You learn by doing, so if you need to evaluate X as a possibility of solving Y problem, then do it on the job. If it&#x27;s not valuable enough for your employer to be paying you for this time, then why bother evaluating it? If X is something none of your devs know anything about, should you really be using it? Maybe there is something less sexy which already well serves that purpose. Maybe you should hire someone who knows X well. Or maybe hire a consultant. If you find yourself regularly having to devote more than a typical 40 hour work week to your job, then maybe that&#x27;s a result of bad management from your employer. In this case, find a different job. Let the founders slave away at their business, it&#x27;s their baby, not yours.<p>For your start-up ideas, maybe you need more focus. The Apple approach is to start with the customer experience with the product and work backwards to the technology. It sounds like you might be too wrapped up in the engineering side. Think of one thing that people will love or that will really help people and work backwards from there. Try selling the thing before you write a single line of code. Put aside a block of time every night when the child (and mother) is sleeping. You can probably accomplish a lot more with a heavy focus put into two hours of time than you can with little focus in a whole day. Repeat this every day and I bet you would be amazed at what you could accomplish.<p>The tech culture is great, but more important is probably the culture of the people you are trying to sell to. Find your customer and you find the culture you should be immersing yourself in. You can probably find that culture outside San Francisco, so move and save some money.<p>WhatsApp was bought for billions of dollars because they built something people could use on feature phones. That&#x27;s the type of phone the world uses. There are all kinds of problems to solve outside of San Francisco, to understand these problems, move there.<p>Once you get your life back, take a look at your start-up ideas. Pick one. What&#x27;s the next step? What&#x27;s the first excuse for not doing it? That excuse is the first item to tackle. By the way, that first step probably isn&#x27;t to start writing code. Finding customers should probably be near the top of the list.<p>This is from someone living in the Philippines with lots of kids. Houses in my area are as cheap as $100 / month. I could literally live the 4 hour work week through client work. Luckily in my case, the oldest kids are old enough that they help a lot with the younger kids. I give them a long leash to explore life without me getting in their way. There are lots of problems here which could use a good engineer.<p>So, don&#x27;t be an engineer for engineers. Go out into the outer world and become an engineer for the people. Being among those people is where you will find your start-up ideas.",1393748411

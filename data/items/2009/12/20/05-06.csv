The necessary technology is mostly here, the main obstacles to implementation are ethical and political.

1005795,comment,1005281,1005281,0,0,sethg,,,"There's a very nice sign in ASL to describe this article.  It uses two hands, and one of them is a fist with the index and little fingers extended, like the horns of a bull.<p>(1) I'm pretty sure it was Klima and Bellungi's book <i>The Signs of Language</i> that pointed out that arm muscles are slower than vocal muscles, and therefore ASL does things that spoken languages <i>can't</i> do in order to maintain the same communication bandwidth.  (That book was written <i>ten years ago</i>.)<p>(2) The handshape is only a very small part of what conveys meaning in sign language; <i>one of the classic newbie mistakes in learning ASL</i> is to look at your conversation partner's hands, rather than his or her eyes.  A great deal of <i>grammatical</i> information is communicated purely by facial expression; for example, raised eyebrows can indicate a yes/no question, lowered eyebrows can indicate a wh-question, and just looking in one direction or shifting the body slightly can substitute for a pronoun.  There are also movements of the mouth that act as adverbial modifiers for a sign, to indicate things like ""almost"", ""carelessly"", ""with difficulty"", ""distant in time or space"", and a whole bunch of other stuff.<p>(3) With regard to the hand and arm movements themselves, the location and movement of the signs are as significant as the handshape.  The signs for ""father"" and ""mother"" differ only in location.  The signs for ""paper"" and ""cheese"" differ only in movement.  Skimming the article, it appears that the authors didn't bother taking location and movement because linguists disagree on how to categorize those other features.  But that's no excuse for <i>completely leaving them out</i> of your analysis.  That's methodological laziness.<p>(4) Modulation of movement also has grammatical significance which in English would be conveyed by modal verbs or adverbs.  For example, a change in how you make the sign for ""to be red"" turns it into ""to become red"".  The Klima and Bellungi book above has more of this kind of thing.<p>(5) There's also the ASL classifier system, which provides a concise way of using the relative position and motion of hands to indicate the relative position and motion of objects in physical <i>or metaphorical</i> space.  I once saw a lecture at which a woman very eloquently used this to describe herself advancing through all four years of her college education while a friend of hers kept repeating her ""prep"" year.  (Gallaudet has a pre-freshman year for students who, thanks to the ocean of suck that is the American deaf-ed system, don't arrive with adequate college preparation.)<p>There have been <i>over thirty years</i> of serious linguistic research into ASL, and judging from the references, these jokers didn't do more than strip-mine it for a list of handshapes.

1005793,comment,1005520,1005689,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"An equilibrium will develop.<p>If you want to fight an interplanetary war, your soldiers have to travel through an environment that will do to them what a wood-chipper does to decomposing animal viscera.  It's unavoidable.  If it turns out we can't make survivable ships, space is the ideal interdiction environment.  Kill 'em out there before they can get down here.<p>Some areas of space (e.g. certain planetary orbits) are naturally important because they allow you to exert influence on combat elsewhere (e.g. by dropping dense objects on the enemy).  So as ships become more survivable, it becomes more feasible to try and garrison strategic positions, and space battles will 'just happen' as opposing garrisons come into contact.",1261287708

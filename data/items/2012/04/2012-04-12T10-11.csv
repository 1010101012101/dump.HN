You're right. Being immoral isn't black and white, in this case it's a line drawn in relation to your relationship to the friend you're considering stealing from.
Now it's clear he obviously holds some value in the friendship since he's willing to fully disclose his ideas to you, ideas which he likely plans to do work on. By stealing his ideas you're not only robbing him of something he cares about and a potential income/customer base etc, but you're also betraying that friendship.<p>Your example of waiting 3 years is a valid one, the reason why the morality changes is because after 3 years he likely will care less about the idea (I mean he didn't do anything with it for 3 years, right?) because it's become apparent he  doesn't care much about it, the robbing and betrayal have less of an impact, to the point where it's so much less of a deal that it's just overwritten by you friendship",1334227941

This would be underutilization of its assets if it were donated because a company usually isn't formed for the purpose of handing out money<p>In other words, why not leave the company to do what it's best at doing and let its shareholders who profit off the company donate or utilize the profits as they see fit. If a company chooses to donate to Red Cross for no specific practical business reason then it is essentially robbing a shareholder the right of choosing to donate his share of the profits to another charity, or of his right to spend it on strippers.<p>Unless the company is donating to further its goals (such as enhancing corporate image or brand), I do not see a place or purpose for arbitrary corporate charity.<p>The 1% equity however can be seen as a contribution from the founder's personal shares, but even then it makes little sense to commit to that early on vs later on especially if the founder plans on not failing.",1334227146

They didn't have great performance but were crazy cheap to make and super easy to overclock. Then they started cramming in just a little bit of on-die L2 cache (about 1/4 of the minimum for a regular Pentium II) to help out performance. This turned out to be wildly successful, and eventually this formulation (one chip with on-die L2 cache) became the predominant design for the mainline Intel micro-processors. Afterwards the Celeron family of processors were identical to retail Pentium/Core cpus but with sections of cache disabled, reduced clock rates, etc. (either due to binning by defects or intentional deactivation).<p>Interestingly, Intel now offers ""upgrade cards"" for low-cost CPUs whereby components are deactivated via firmware or suchlike and special codes can be entered into the bios screen to turn them on (for a price, of course).",1334227068

3831764,comment,3824908,3825442,2,0,geoffschmidt,,,"I agree with all of this :) Meteor is self-contained and installing it in /usr/local is totally optional. The reason we install into /usr/local is that it is a way to get the 'meteor' command into the user's path without trying to edit their dotfiles for them, and without setting obscure system preferences that the user would have trouble unsetting. We went to a lot of trouble to make it easy to try Meteor, and we thought that ""great, now go edit your dotfiles"" would have lost a lot of people.<p>If you don't want it in /usr/local, you can check it out anywhere you like and just run the 'meteor' in the top directory of the checkout, and it'll work great. This is mentioned in the README/on Github, and it's how we have been developing Meteor. You can have as many copies of Meteor on your system as you like, and they can even coexist with a copy at /usr/local. So for me, I type '~/co/meteor' to run the meteor that I'm developing on, and 'meteor' by itself to run the latest official release.<p>You can either build the binary dependencies (node, etc) yourself by running an included script, or if you do not, the first time you run meteor it will automatically fetch a prebuilt binary kit for your convenience. All of the binary dependencies are kept in a directory in the checkout and managed by meteor, meaning that each meteor install on your system can have its own version of node.<p>Finally, to your last point, 'meteor bundle' does exactly that :P In fact, right now on our deploy servers, we have live apps running that were deployed with a variety of historical versions of meteor, all coexisting side by side.<p>I'm sure we'll have to revisit all of this as the Meteor ecosystem gets bigger and more complicated -- when all of the packages do not fit in a 'packages' directory, and when there are more binary dependencies than node and mongo. But I hope that this helps to persuade you that we're not totally nuts, despite how sleep deprived I was when we recorded that screencast.<p>If you thought this was a helpful answer, could you repost the question on Stack Overflow (with the 'meteor' tag), and drop me an email (address is in my HN profile?)

3831751,comment,3831649,3831723,26,0,jaspervdj,,,"> To me, it looks like you haven't ""done"" anything at all. You haven't emulated a single instruction. This part of the emulator in C++ would be a couple of structs and helper functions thrown at the top of the file.<p>It seems there's a bit of a misunderstanding. The code in the blogpost consists of incomplete snippets, taken from the actual implementation, found in this repo [1], e.g. the emulator [2]. The reason why I have not included the entire codebase in the blogpost is conciseness; I only wanted to include what's necessary to illustrate the points I wanted to make. I realise this is perhaps a bit unclear and I'll update the post to state this more clearly.<p>> As far as I can see, you've just written a bunch of very complicated code and monads, to get you to place would would have started at in a non-functional language. In that case, what exactly have you gained by using Haskell at all?<p>As much as you would gain by implementing a basic skeleton in any language. In this case, what the blogpost focusses on, is that I have written two backends ways, the ST and the IO one.<p>The advantage of the ST backend is that is guaranteed to be deterministic (which is possible in Haskell): the code cannot perform any side effects visible to the external world.<p>The IO backend does not offer this guarantee, and needs to be able to communicate with the outside world in order to grab keyboard events and display video.<p>The advantage of using the monadic abstraction is that the actual emulator implementation is the same (completely shared code) for both these backends. This allows you to e.g., get deterministic results for tests, while still being able to support all features in the actual emulator binary.<p>The deterministic property is an advantage of using Haskell. I am sure an equivalent of the monadic abstraction could also be implemented using some OOP system.<p>> P.S. Sorry if this comment comes across as insulting / argumentative. I do not have the time to write it in a more pleasing way.<p>No insult taken.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/jaspervdj/dcpu16-hs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jaspervdj/dcpu16-hs</a>

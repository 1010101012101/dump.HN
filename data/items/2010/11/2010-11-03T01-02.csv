Her time travel books play (partly, obviously) decades in the future yet there are constantly people running around and frantically looking for each other and not finding anyone. I always want to scream “Pick up your goddamn cellphone!” (Some of those were written in the nineties which explains their lack of cellphones but even her most recent books from this year have the same problem.)",1288749592

Some people use Google Docs, others use <a href=""http://happyjobsearch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://happyjobsearch.com/</a> (free) and some like <a href=""http://www.jibberjobber.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jibberjobber.com/</a> (freemium).<p>We built <a href=""http://linkup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linkup.com</a> for that very reason that people prefer and get better results applying straight to company's own websites. If you'd like to discuss it more, email me at eric@linkup.com.<p>That biggest point that I wanted to talk about is ""Have I already applied for this listing"" problem. When sites talk about having 9M+ job openings in the US, that's because they show the same job opening multiple times. They have algorithms that take a job title, break it into chunks, and then remerge them in multiple methods. A good test is Microsoft - see how many jobs whatever site you're using has for openings at Microsoft - at any time Microsoft has around 2k openings, so if you see some multiple of that then something fishy is afoot.<p>Bluntly, it is a pain in the ass because the sites make money by having a huge number of repeat jobseekers continually visiting the site - who think that the site is 100% doing everything in the jobseekers best interest. But when you introduce a pay-per-post or pay-per-click model into the mix, delivering the best, purest jobs becomes contradictory to making a short-term profit.

The potential is there - the same cannot be said for anywhere else in the world.<p>Europeans take their ideas to the U.S. because in Europe there's no money for innovations. There's no infrastructure for it. China is trying the wrong approach and producing nothing. Japan has incremental improvements ingrained in its culture.<p>However I think he's right about the stimulus and money. The big government approach doesn't produce anything innovative either. We're building roads in the USA - that's good, but... not gonna change the world now is it? Printing money is currently undermining the USA - it's surprising inflation isn't much worse than it is but at some point something will have to give. 
It reminds me a bit of the housing bubble - for years house prices were going up, way into silly territory, and beyond. But eventually, the market corrected itself. Now, we're printing US$ Tns every year and there seem to be no negative effects - but that, also, is going to eventually hit home. It's going to make America a country of cheap labor. Inflation will catch up.",1288748897

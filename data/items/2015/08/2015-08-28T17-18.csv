These are things that are basically not going to happen in Ruby, Python, Go, Javascript, or etc.:<p>1) You get the benefits of Erlang/OTP as others have mentioned in their replies.<p>2) You also get the amazing macro capabilities (runtime code execution and runtime code generation, a la LISP) that Elixir brings to the table.  Many of the language features of Elixir are written in macros in Elixir.  The source to both Elixir and Phoenix are quite elegant and educational to browse, and demonstrate this runtime code generation aspect very well.  It&#x27;s straightforward in Elixir to introspect code, represent that code as data structures, manipulate those data structures, then generate or execute that code, as you can in LISP.<p>3) Immuatable data and functional style leads to better code in lots of ways.  This is what really makes the benefits of OTP possible (updating the code without restarting the servers, easily migrating state between servers, and so on).  But it also makes certain kinds of situations easier to understand and fix, since all state in the system can be expressed as parameters to functions.",1440784478

It will not have memristors, and will run a slightly modified form of Linux. It is supposed to have 2,500 cpu cores and 320 TBytes of conventional RAM memory. That is about 500 times less memory than the 157 PBytes they were talking about last year. I am guessing without evidence that the processing distribution will be about 1250 Xeons with 20 cores in each, but really don&#x27;t know. That amount of conventional memory suggests it won&#x27;t be in a trade show, but will be in a controlled environment for invited guests, where HP can better control the message and defer all the questions:<p><a href=""http://bit.ly/1fyBtO6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1fyBtO6</a><p>Essentially, the point of all this is that HPQ has a long history of failing to deliver on and/or lowering the expectations of while pushing out delivery dates of announced products. There is no real reason that I can see to believe that HP Enterprise or whatever will suddenly establish the follow-through integrity that has clearly been lost in HPQ. Those fast/slow/soon/late/high yield/low yield memristors might never be available from a financial corporate descendant of HPQ.<p>I think there is a small fundamental flaw in the message HP is promoting about distributing their processors far apart from one another in an effort for each processor to be closer to local memory while having a seemingly contradictory flat memory model. That is that most of the tasks one would want to execute on such a machine would certainly be multithreaded. In many multithreaded tasks, parent threads need to quickly know when daughter threads have completed their tasks so that they can use these interim results to continue. The speed of light in glass fiber is typically about 2/3 that of light in a vacuum. It is reasonable to assume a typical thread process will execute (at maximum efficiency) at more than 6 billion instructions per second in the year 2020. So, let&#x27;s say that a daughter thread is running 50 feet away (not physically, but as the optical cable bends) from a parent. This means that the daughter process could have executed over 450 instructions while the &quot;thread complete&quot; message is in transit to the parent (in addition to the overhead in more conventional architectures) and would have to wait out more than 450 additional instruction executions while waiting for the parent thread to begin issuing something new. Translated, the concept of &#x27;The Machine&#x27; would lose its speed advantage in a programming environment where thread execution instruction counts are relatively low, such as the majority of in-memory database object manipulation.<p>In contrast to &#x27;The Machine&#x27;, successful architectures will, I think, increasingly move their processing cores together more akin to directions of the Nvidia Tesla, Intel Phi, and AMD FirePro, to name a few. Speculating further, massive amounts of memory may likely be arrayed spherically outward, perhaps on a 3-D radiant structure with cooling fluid [such as helium gas] running within the fingers. If each of these limbs comes with threading, contacts, and a seal system so it can be removed and replaced, then the mean-time-to-repair can be kept low.<p>My guess is that even though there has not been any disappointing news about &#x27;The Machine&#x27; in over a month now, there will be a lot more as the dog-and-pony show that is supposed to occur late next year nears, and there will be more still prior to 2020",1440784174

If you have more tips, let the Hacker News community know.<p>1. If you have dynamic serving on your website, ensure we send a vary: http header.
2. Optimize for finger clicks rather than cursor clicks. For important links, we should have minimum 7mm width/height (48 CSS pixels) and for lesser important links, minimum of 5 mm.
3. Line spacing is important. Minimum 1.2 em.
4. Load time matters- a lot. Average mobile website page load takes 7 seconds. In Google&#x27;s tests, 1 second is the point beyond which people get distracted.

Within the debian directory is the build system, including local patches, which live under debian/patches.<p>> Changes are atomic. They use the bdb transactions and rollback. Either something was installed (via CPIO) or it was not. Debian package manager uses flat text-files! Those flat text files live under /var/lib/dpkg [Figure 1 below]. There are about 3-4 of these files per package, and they often times corrupt, resulting in impossible to uninstall packages. This simply doesn’t exist with rpms.<p>I have seen the RPM database become corrupted several times over the years, including if I tried to install an RPM while low on disk space! I have never seen the same with the dpkg database. And dpkg is no less &quot;atomic&quot;; dpkg keeps track of a package&#x27;s state, and if interrupted a new instance will clean up or resume whatever the old instance was doing.<p>> •	The Debian package format lacked multiarch support until Jan 31, 2012[2]. Up until this version, installing a 32 bit deb on a 64 bit operating system involved creating a full system 32 bit chroot (I shit you not!), with hundreds of megabytes of silliness. Rpm has had multiarch basically since the majority of Fedora compiled with 64 bit compilers (around early 2005).<p>This is not a valid comparison. Multiarch in RPM means something completely different to what it means in dpkg. dpkg&#x27;s multiarch system is much more powerful and complete.<p>> With dpkg, it is possible to get into states which are impossible to resolve with the cli utilities (even dpkg –-configure –a). This always results in having to manually edit the pre/post hacky script under /var/lib/dpkg and is serious voodoo black magic that only experts should ever do. The problem is that it isn’t uncommon. If the pre/post scripts do ever fail bad enough to where you can’t fully remove a package, you can do rpm –e –-noscripts.<p>This is 6 of one, half-a-dozen of the other. In the RPM world you end up without the cleanup from the script ever taking place, and so the package ends up leaving traces of whatever throughout your system.<p>I&#x27;ve never thought of editing the maintainer scripts under /var/lib/dpkg/info as &quot;serious voodoo&quot;. They are simple shell scripts, written to dispatch off of argv in the machinism specified by Policy. Errors in good quality packages are rare and trivial to fix.<p>> Debian packages have this “rc” state where they are partially installed / uninstalled, but not fully either. Then you have to purge them using dpkg –-purge, and that is assuming that you’ve successfully hacked up the scripts that read the plain text files under /var/lib/dpkg.<p>This is a good feature of dpkg. It allows packages to be removed without their conffiles or other important data (e.g., your PostgreSQL databases) being removed along with them, unless the admin takes the manual action to purge the package.<p>> The entire design is unbelievably fragile. They make it a bit less fragile by writing an ENORMOUS debian packaging policy[5] to try to get people to work around silly limitations in the software via policy. This is against one of the fundamental design choices of rpm, which is that package installs should be atomic. It is either installed, or not installed. There is no “I’m half installed” status for rpm packages.<p>So then, what state is a package in if RPM is interrupted while unpacking files? dpkg puts the package into &#x27;half-installed&#x27; state, from where you can run a new instance to continue the installation or remove the package.<p>As for CDBS or debhelper, the vast majority of packages in the archive use debhelper, and debhelper use is increasing over time. Developer documentation tells you to use debhelper. The rest of the complaints about the build process I really don&#x27;t understand, but perhaps I have just been building packages for too long. I&#x27;ll take &#x27;dpkg -i foo.deb&#x27; over &#x27;rpm -ivh&#x27;, oh wait, I meant &#x27;-Uvh&#x27; any day. :p",1440783015

It&#x27;s not because women aren&#x27;t as interested in dating but because I&#x27;d think women have an easier time hooking up than men. If a woman wants to meet men all she has to do is visit a pub and you&#x27;ve got the attention of 5 outgoing, more chatty than usual men for every 1 woman. The opposite probably isn&#x27;t quite as true. The 5:1 ratio surely exists the other way around but a yoga class isn&#x27;t exactly a place to hook up and most would be really bothered by an advance at a yoga class. So unless you happen to have a certain social circle, as a man you&#x27;d be more desperate to try to meet women online than a woman, who has various opportunities to meet men in the real world.<p>But then AM adds a whole extra layer ontop, which is marketed for affairs. And there I feel the disposition towards cheating also differs between sexes. At least, intentional, planned cheating. i.e. woman probably cheat just as often, but it&#x27;s probably very much a male thing to register on a website specific for dating guys who cheat (and being comfortable then, with the notion that whoever you&#x27;re meeting is also a cheater), pay a whole load of money for this, and then hook up with guys you know are cheating on their wives. Whereas a man who&#x27;s looking to cheat probably doesn&#x27;t care much that the woman he&#x27;s hooking up with is cheating on her husband. There&#x27;s this whole layer of &#x27;family wrecking&#x27; and notions about sex that men and women probably, on average, think differently about. Most women who are comfortable with such relationships are probably part of a swinger couple anyway which isn&#x27;t cheating and not part of AM&#x27;s market.<p>The combination of the two is such that you get ridiculous ratios.

This depends on the precise definitions of &quot;case&quot; and &quot;petition.&quot;<p>But you are way too late to the party when it comes to deciding the legal meaning of these words. The prevailing judicial understanding, for more than 100 years, of the &quot;Case and Controversy&quot; clause has been that Article III courts can only hear lawsuits involving more-or-less concrete injuries.<p>And as tptacek has pointed out, this is probably for the best. Imagine the chaos if the courts were constitutionally required to hear every grievance brought by a member of the public, even if it did not affect his or her interests in any concrete way. Then also imagine the quality of the legal reasoning that would result from such a farcical system, where there was no guarantee that a plaintiff actually had any interest in its outcome.<p>You may wish that courts had the power to hear petitions for the redress of grievances when it is your grievance you wish to see redressed. But you should also consider the wider universe of grievances and whether you would really want to see them all ventilated in a court of law.<p>Edit: There are very many cases that state this clearly but here is is a somewhat random selection:<p>&quot;The party who invokes the [judicial] power must be able to show, not only that the statute is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.&quot; - COM.

It&#x27;s extremely fast and supports RPC-style request/response.<p>You get load balancing and discoverability for free, since NATS will distribute messages equally to consumers: Just fire up new consumers, and they will get messages to the topics they subscribe to, and all a client needs is the host/port of the NATS server, which is going to be the same for all parties. Couple that with some hand-coded serialization — Protobuf, Msgpack or even JSON — and you have a fairly resilient, fault-tolerant RPC.<p>You could trivially do streaming RPC if you handled the request/response matching yourself — if you look at the clients, NAT&#x27;s RPC is all handled on the client side, using ordinary messages with a unique topic name generated for each request/response. Extending it to support multiple replies per request would be simple.<p>There are other, more feature-rich message queues, of course, such as RabbitMQ. NATS&#x27; advantage is that it&#x27;s extremely simple.<p>Another option is ZeroMQ, but it&#x27;s a bit lower-level and doesn&#x27;t solve the discoverability part.

That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re even slightly listening, and why their line to date has been variants of &quot;Can&#x27;t you just try harder?&quot; From their point of view, the only thing that has to happen is that customers of American businesses need to be <i>convinced</i> that they are secure; real security is to them a fully separable concern only loosely related to perceptions.<p>I personally would observe that over time, perception of security and reality of security would tend to synchronize, but one thing you must understand about government or it will forever be mysterious to you is that it is full of people who are used to <i>creating</i> perceptions, wholesale, with varying and often small relationships to the truth. Watch the next high-level policy debate that happens on CNN and Fox, and yes, I&#x27;m deliberately picking mass media because it&#x27;s actually where it is clearest to see. Note how the debate is almost <i>never</i> about facts, real facts, provable and disprovable facts. It is about manufacturing perceptions, and the other side trying to manufacture a perception that fits into people&#x27;s heads more easily and therefore wins out. If you try to argue that actually weakening security will directly, via facts, create a perception of weak security, you are almost literally saying words that they can not even represent in their brains.<p>Perceptions don&#x27;t come from reality for them... perceptions are <i>created</i>, by acts of will and clever spin. When we technologists say that people will perceive our stuff as insecure and not buy it, the solution that leaps to their mind is to use their usual tools to create the necessary perception, then weaken the security under that cover, and to them, we sound like children who believe that reality somehow creates perceptions independently and reliably in people, which to them is snicker-worthy childish naivity.<p>And worst of all, they&#x27;re being rational. <i>It works</i>. All the time. Even here on HN in a lot of other of the perennial debates. It&#x27;s very difficult to rationally argue them out of this position because rather a lot of the facts support their view.<p>A disturbing number of them accept the perceptions created as a whole as reality even though they are witnesses to or authors of the creation of perceptions themselves, so a disturbing number of these people on one level or another essentially believe they are <i>creating reality</i>. (I find this observation an incredibly important aspect of understanding how the very highest level of politicians operate, as after decades in this world, most of them fit this.) It&#x27;s basically that observation about how when you read your own field of expertise in the paper you see how crap the reporting is but still believe the other bits of the paper, writ large. Others realize the process consciously to one extent or another and are simply cynically exploiting it.<p>Now, I believe the technologists are still correct, because for the most part, security purchasers at the high end are fairly rationally evaluating products, and real weaknesses will create perceptions of weakness, and probably little to nothing the government perception-writers can do will change that. But it&#x27;s hard to explain the government how this is one of those rare places where the engineering and the math are just too hard and too rigorous, the connection to reality too direct and too strong, for <i>their</i> toolset to be of much use. They encounter that situation so rarely they don&#x27;t really believe it exists.",1440781684

10136627,comment,10136014,10136453,0,0,alejohausner,,,"This also gets me thinking about pesticides in apples, of all things.  I read Michael Pollan&#x27;s &quot;The Botany of Desire&quot; a while ago, and was really struck by the story of Johnny Appleseed.  For those of you who didn&#x27;t grow up in the USA, he travelled through the country planting apple seeds, so that later settlers would find whole apple orchards in place when they moved in.<p>The interesting thing is that apples don&#x27;t &quot;spring true&quot; from seed.  In other words, an tree that bears sweet apples will almost certainly have seeds that lack the gene for sweetness.  Apple trees grown from seed will certainly bear crab apples.  They are sour, and are only good for fermenting and making alcoholic apple cider.  Settlers were certainly happy to have crab apples, because cider is fun and easy to make.  But they certainly didn&#x27;t <i>eat</i> those apples.<p>If you want sweet apples, you have to use grafting: if you are lucky enough to get a tree with sweet apples, you will probably immortalize it, but taking cuttings from its branches, and grafting them onto ordinary crab-apple root stock.  The part of the tree above ground will be genetically different from the part below.  If the root stock nears death, you&#x27;ll take cuttings from the part above ground and graft them onto new roots.<p>This is all very nice, but it sidesteps evolution: you&#x27;ve created an immortal organism, which won&#x27;t be able to fight off insects, fungus, and bacteria that attack apples, and which are constantly evolving to overcome a plant&#x27;s defenses.  Since the tree can&#x27;t generate new chemicals that kill or repel these attackers, humans have to invent fungicides and insecticides to do it for them.  That&#x27;s why apple farming relies so heavily on spraying scary chemicals on the trees.<p>Any war you declare on time and change is a war you will lose.",1440781562

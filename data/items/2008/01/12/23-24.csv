Simple as that.<p>For a similar reason, the infamous OS wars are not as pointless as they seem. If I invest in Linux or OS X, I also have an interest to protect that investment, which means the OS in question should keep a minimum level of popularity.",1200182276

But he is wrong.<p>I'm confident that on a long enough time scale, human death wont be necessary and we'll be able to backup and fork our intelligence in machines.<p>On that time scale, colonization is entirely possible, even without the inevitable expansion of knowledge of physics that might enable faster than light information transfer. Information is all that is necessary to transfer if you upload your intelligence.<p>That said, the steps to get into space for scientific purposes and for eventual colonization are identical and largely divergent from the current approach.<p>Scrap the shuttle and all human missions. Focus on telepresence and robotic intelligence. Build the infrastructure to make it easy to get humans into orbit.",1200182138

97672,comment,97587,97587,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I always thought that Drucker said it best: ""Profit is the cost of doing business.""<p>Businesses exist for a purpose: to provide goods and/or services to customers.  They don't exist <i>just</i> to make money.  You can make money in plenty of other ways and not have a business.  (Think about a lottery winner or speculator.)<p>But if you want to keep doing business, you have to make money, and you have to make money over and above the cost of capital.  Otherwise, you'll never be able to marshal the resources necessary to keep providing your goods and services.",1200181603

97669,comment,97587,97662,0,0,gigamon,,,"I agree with that.  I think they are closely related.<p>However, my experience is that as entrepreneurs we can lure ourselves into thinking that bringing good to the world and building a great company is the end and not the means.  And if we do that, then money will follow.    This is the primary message from Guy Kawasaki whom I have tremendous respect for.<p>However, my own experience is that this is true is if the stars and moons are aligned.  So I am offering an alternative which is to focus on making money first.<p>This is in contraction to what a VC would want to hear.  But I am of the opinion that taking VC money is not the prerequisite of building startup.<p>At the same time, I am not trying to demonize VC's.  They have a place in our world and when appropriate, it can be very important to us.<p>In summary, I just want to provide some food for thoughts.<p>Thanks for your comment.<p>--Denny--",1200180373

They are really the same thing, although they appear to be different. Fooling oneself into thinking they really are separate things is harmful to the wealth of an entrepreneur.",1200179233

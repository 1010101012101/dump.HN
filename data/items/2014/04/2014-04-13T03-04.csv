There&#x27;s a note in the menu saying &quot;a service charge of 15% will be added&quot; or something like that.<p>Those sorts of restaurants are often already the most expensive; and of course it&#x27;s a ruse to keep the apparent price low. The &quot;service charge&quot; is just creative accounting though, the servers just get paid as normal, it&#x27;s really just a part of your food-bill.<p>Why do you find it unlikely that a law would be passed to force restaurants to be included in minimum wage laws and so actually have to pay reasonable wages?<p>Also when you charge $35 people consider your lobster better, even if it&#x27;s just a comparatively inflated price.",1397361565

At the very least this seems to indicate that the co-founder is essential for fundraising.<p>I want to stress that you as a co-founder should never let anyone talk you into staying with the company through fundraising and then leave. Telling an investor that a co-founder is leaving just after fundraising does not instill confidence, and planning to leave without telling prospective investors violates their trust. If you do this then you&#x27;ll get a bad reputation with investors and it quite honestly makes you look like a bad person, so don&#x27;t ever do that.

I like the idea of a similar weekly tradition for HN. Weekly feedback is great motivation, and the ideas that come out of here are often superb. That being said, screenshots are not the best format for every progress report. It works well for game developers because such a large part of games is visual, but that&#x27;s not the case for a lot of things hackers might be working on. Something like &quot;Side Project Saturday[1]&quot; would work much better.<p>Another problem is agreeing on who would post these weekly threads. If something semi-official wasn&#x27;t decided on people may race to be the first to post every Saturday because of the guaranteed karma, which would lead to threads starting at pessimal times. While the optimal time would be 9 AM EST[2] for maximum exposure, people might be posting the second it turns midnight (or even earlier), which would lead to empty threads and ultimately the death of the tradition.

An analogy to medicine might be worrying about your ability to take a good history and physical exam, but in the meanwhile the patient is bleeding in front of you.<p>The problem is not your ability to write code - the CTO even admits as much when he says he needs you now but wants to replace you later. Your code is desperately needed. But I don&#x27;t really care about this.<p>Assuming a normal situation, the company is yours and your co-founder&#x27;s (by ownership), and the CTO likely has a small amount of equity (relative to yours). In an early stage company that hasn&#x27;t yet raised money, your company is basically an extension of yourself. You don&#x27;t have responsibilities to shareholders or employees because you don&#x27;t have either yet. You have a responsibility to yourself and your vision. The CTO did not found the company and that alone tells you that you have some amount of vision, ability, or ability to take advantage of chance that he did not have.<p>If you want to remain involved in the company, and it seems that you do and should, then you need to clarify for the CTO where the boundaries of his responsibilities lie. His job is not to ask you to quit, and he may be beyond the point where you can continue working with him (or not - I don&#x27;t know enough detail). But if he is to continue working for you (and do recall that he works for you at your pleasure), he needs to focus on solutions that don&#x27;t involve him trying to fire you.<p>Most founders don&#x27;t end up coding very much after their companies grow, and the CTO may be hopeful to get more experienced programmers working for the company. But there are about 10,000 miles in between &quot;we should hire people with deep experience in X&quot; and &quot;I want you to leave the company.&quot; The latter is a political gambit that needs to be dealt with after careful consideration in a way that shows teeth.",1397360680

You&#x27;re mostly just stating advantages/disadvantages of one design over the other, without explaining why this should be correlated so very strongly with manual/autonomous control.<p>> Autonomous helicopters are multi-rotor for simplicity and reliability<p>Simplicity (less upkeep) and reliability (safety) seem <i>more</i> important for expensive, manned helicopters!  So this argument, on its face, <i>contradicts</i> what we actually see.  The only argument working in the right direction is something like &quot;simplicity for tiny vehicles (which are necessarily unmanned) is important because number/complexity of parts makes up a larger fraction of total cost compared to large vehicles where raw materials dominate&quot;.<p>> Piloted multirotors aren&#x27;t as popular because they need computer control to be stable<p>Large helicopters are expensive.  The computers necessary to stabilize them are going to be just a tiny cost.  On the other hand, for a drone the computers could be a sizeable fraction of the price.  So, again, this argument appears to go against reality.<p>> batteries don&#x27;t scale well,<p>Then why is this truck-sized vehicle (presumably using internal combustion) a multi-rotor?<p>> and combustion engines have slower throttle response<p>Ok, so this is close to an answer.  The (weak) argument would be &quot;humans want quick throttle response but robots don&#x27;t much care&quot;.  But this isn&#x27;t too convincing, as I could easily see it being true that humans are better able than robots at compensating for slow responses.",1397360395

He&#x27;s mindset is so wrong for the startup world, just assuming things will take-off and by-then you are not needed anymore. You are desperately needed now; that makes you valuable.

It sounds like the best outcome might be a (hopefully amicable) separation, if the professional relationship doesn&#x27;t look like it has a future, but in that case you&#x27;re well within your rights to expect fair compensation for anything you&#x27;re giving up.<p>But before you do anything else, talk to a lawyer who specialises in this kind of subject, discuss the details of your exact situation, and take advice accordingly.",1397359064

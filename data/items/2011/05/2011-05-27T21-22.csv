2593229,comment,2591102,2592755,10,0,raganwald,,,"Sometimes, a really simple statement is a Tabula Rasa. We read into it what we believe, or what we think others might believe. Nothing exceptionally wrong with that, and so we ask the author: ""Did you mean such-and-such?"" If they didn't, they clarify their intent and we move along.<p>I have spent more time thinking about the nature of programming languages than editors, so I will perhaps ruin a perfectly good neutral statement by talking about my own beliefs. I think there is such a thing as a power continuum in languages. I have no idea whether Haskell is more powerful than Clojure, but I am comfortable describing Java as far down the continuum from Scheme.<p>I also think there is such a thing as <i>design</i> in programming languages, and I think it has value. So while Python may be less powerful than some other languages in an absolute sense, I understand why many people choose it. It is well-designed in exactly the same way that the original iPod (No Wireless. Less Space Than A Nomad. Lame.) was well-designed. And by well-designed, I don't mean ""Has all the features, "" I mean, ""Has a carefully selected set of features that complement each other.""<p>Given my beliefs, I understand people who prefer to work with more powerful languages and why they might argue that you never need to step down the power continuum. Makes sense. I also understand people who argue a certain tool that is less powerful in an absolute sense but has a design that suits them in some fundamental way. I even understand people who argue that certain languages are more powerful <i>and</i> well-designed, like Haskell.<p>I honestly don't have a strong feeling that either person is wrong, and I'm fairly comfortable saying that we haven't done enough research to settle the matter empirically.<p>So no, I am certainly not ridiculing Lisp users who claim that there is no need to step down the power continuum. They may be right, and we don't have enough solid evidence to disprove their claims, just what amounts to folklore about readability and design patterns and significant whitespace and monkey-patching.<p>Likewise, I cannot really argue with an emacs evangelist. Who can say that such an argument is anything except Blub? I value certain well-designed text editors--I have been enjoying Byword lately--but can I prove that I'm more efficient with Byword than I would be if I spent two weeks or a month or a few years becoming an emacs guru?<p>So anyways, no I was not being derisive, but I don't fault anybody for wondering if I had something on my mind considering that I tried very hard to say nothing about whether Emacs is or isn't superior to Byword, or whether Ruby is or isn't an acceptable Lisp.",1306533530

My last job (academic research) I was a full time MATLAB coder, and I can say that MATLAB has many problems of its own.  It has a decent all in-one IDE/REPL that makes it easy to get started and do off the cuff work.  It has very well optimized matrix operations, you can cook up some decent scripts and it has some nice toolboxes, but for anything larger it very quickly becomes a huge mess.  Try maintaining and updating a 100k+ loc MATLAB script with others.  Or writing a GUI.   It's not pretty.  MATLAB might not quite deserve the terrible reputation it has within the larger software community, but I would never go back, and can testify that there is a massive and rapid migration among the scientific community away from MATLAB into Python going on right now.",1306530626

PAW and CERNLIB were standard in the 90's but now most major experiments use ROOT. You can use ROOT with Python but most people don't bother. Programming comes pretty naturally to most physicists and learning the details of the ROOT libraries and experiment specific libraries takes much more time than picking up C++. I've seen most grad students get comfortable with the basics of C++ in a couple of days while they typically struggle with the usage of the libraries for a number of months. The documentation is autogenerated from the code so in many cases you need to read through the library code to figure out how things work. In these situations it's very helpful to be as comfortable as possible in C++. The benefit of using Python instead of C++ would be fairly minimal in my opinion because so much of analysis work depends on understanding these libraries that are written in a lower level language out of necessity.<p>What occurred to me while reading this article though is that we should perhaps be using Python for our scripting needs. We have a number of scripts that we use regularly for querying databases and submitting jobs and most of them are written in Perl. I think that Python would be much easier to read and hack; especially because most of the physicists don't know Perl.",1306530360

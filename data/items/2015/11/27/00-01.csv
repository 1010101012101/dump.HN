I want to know where these perceived benefits even are, because they keep the discourse about how to <i>fix</i> copyright unproductive when half the people are defending it for... some reason?",1448585963

It&#x27;s that you&#x27;re unfairly discriminating against the vast majority of medium/poor-credit people, while giving free money to equally poor-credit banks, who, as we all know, would be bust long ago because the liability side of their balance sheets are much bigger than assets, were it not for the prop-up of free money and wholesale transfer of bad assets to the public, at par prices instead of the steep discounts that should be warranted.<p>We&#x27;re free-funding a zombie banking system in the hope that by inflating assets we&#x27;ll bail them out &quot;on the sly&quot;, meantime, all that money is being siphoned off by the wealthy into getting wealthier.<p>The working and middle classes are paying more than their fair share of the crisis, while capital (banks) has not been haircut for its bad decisions. Free markets are based on the principle that mistakes are punished, good decisions rewarded. We&#x27;re instead short-circuiting the punishment warranted by poor capital allocation decisions pre-crisis.<p>It&#x27;s squarely a political problem, a problem of huge discrimination in favour of the incumbent wealthy at the expense of everyone else.",1448585056

If the sugars (fructose) are locked in a matrix of cellulose (AKA dietary fibre) they&#x27;re released gradually as your body digests the bulk matter. If you plot the blood sugar concentration of the person consuming a solid piece of fruit you see a nice curve where the levels rise, peak, and non-violently fall.<p>Now when you process the fruit you&#x27;re effectively pre-digesting it - the sugars are free of the cellulose matrix (the bulk of the fruit) and when you plot the blood sugar concentration after consumption of juice, because no work needs to be done to digest it, the blood sugar level quickly spikes. This provides a rush, then your insulin response peaks, sending your blood sugar levels crashing. This happens much faster than the curve in blood sugar from eating unprocessed fruit.<p>The only argument I&#x27;ll accept from people who drink juice: They like it. <i>That&#x27;s OK.</i> You&#x27;re allowed to like things. I like beer, which acts similarly to juice with regards to blood sugar concentration.",1448584508

Since I was confused as to why there were other clips with the same person that didn&#x27;t seem to be from this show, I wasted some time researching this and determined the following:<p>There was a series of dumb comedy tv shows that were supposed to be lessons in how to make people angry. In these shows, this actor (Shinichi Usui) was supposed to be a professor, who demonstrated how to make people angry by disrespecting them. The person who directed these shows then went on to direct the show the clip you have linked is from, and apparently brought on the same actor to do essentially the same thing but as a different character.<p>This was simply a short gag on two different shows directed by the same person that was more about the silly facial expression made by the actor than about the actual destroying of the business cards.<p>I have taken the time to write a reply (to this comment that is arguably only tangentially related to the original link) that is arguably unnecessarily detailed because misinformation about Japan and Japanese TV shows seems to be so prevalent on the internet. In particular, I want to dispel the idea that the very idea of crushing business cards is somehow so shocking to Japanese people (more than it would be in other countries) that there would be a reality show just about someone crushing business cards.",1448583833

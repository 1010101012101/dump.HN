Although some of the specifics no longer apply because 30-year Treasury bonds aren&#x27;t near 10% like they were when the author became financially independent (in the 1980s), a lot of the rest sounds like something you&#x27;d be interested.  Actually, it looks like there&#x27;s a revised edition (2008) that I had not seen until just now.  In brief, the book is about cutting un-needed expenses, and earning as much as you can, in order to start making enough interest income to no longer need to work, at which point you can do what you would do if you didn&#x27;t have to get paid, if you so desire.",1377129590

The United States Geological Surveys National Water Quality Assessment Program has gathered limited data since 1991 on representative study basins around the USA. These data indicate a median manganese level of 16 g/l in surface waters, with 99th-percentile concentrations of 400800 g/l (Leahy & Thompson, 1994; USGS, 2001).

OK, I have a lot of time on my hands so I&#x27;m game:<p>I think that exaggeration of the effect of Manning&#x27;s leaks is what led to the overly harsh sentence in the first place. The least we could do in discussing it is not make the same mistake.<p>I think Manning&#x27;s sentence is much too long. But at the same time, I don&#x27;t think misrepresenting how harsh it is does any side of the argument any good. I&#x27;m sensitive enough to realize that if we want reasonable sentences, we will have to be honest about how harsh a sentence really is. I can also predict that critics will write us off as irrational or whiny if we make a habit of overreacting every time something happens we don&#x27;t like.<p>I&#x27;m not insensitive. On the contrary, I can imagine much worse sentences that could have been handed down, up to and including capital punishment for treason. As crushing as the final sentence must be to Manning and those near him, I can also understand the coping mechanisms they will resort to to deal with it. One of those is that the sentence is not as bad as it could have been.",1377126823

Obama is thinking about the situation like a lawyer and as a result he can&#x27;t understand why there would be such a vociferous objection now of all times.<p>As the recently declassified FISC opinion shows, most of the NSA program is broadly within well-established law. Third-party doctrine means it&#x27;s not illegal to get data from third parties like Google or Facebook, and it&#x27;s well-accepted that 4th amendment protections don&#x27;t apply to foreigners. The U.S. has been surveilling foreigners for decades now, and has been gathering records from third parties like banks, etc, for decades as well. The <i>legal</i> nit to pick with the NSA&#x27;s recent efforts seems to be that it&#x27;s doing searches on purely domestic communications that indadvertedly get caught in the nets (though it also seems that the NSA isn&#x27;t trying very hard to make the nets finer). But you can&#x27;t object to the very foundations of the program purely on legal principles.<p>If you&#x27;re looking at it from a legal point of view, it seems like a lot of uproar over something that&#x27;s bad, but not something that&#x27;s bad down to its foundations.<p>But to the digerati, it&#x27;s a much bigger deal, and as someone who is not in that group I think Obama can&#x27;t appreciate that point of view. The idea of getting e-mails from Google strikes a chord with many people in a way that the idea of getting bank records from banks doesn&#x27;t. The digerati oppose electronic surveillance on principle, and don&#x27;t care if analogous programs have existed in other areas for decades.<p>Incidentally, I don&#x27;t expect Obama, or old line politicians like Feinstein or Pelosi to &quot;get it&quot; any time soon. This seems to be a &quot;you either get it or you don&#x27;t&quot; issue. Either you have a visceral aversion to the idea of electronic surveillance or you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s much more an emotional issue as anything else, and Obama&#x27;s not an emotional guy. He&#x27;s also a big government liberal, so he doesn&#x27;t have any reason to oppose the NSA program on those grounds. He&#x27;s got the most aggressive foreign policy and national security policy of any Democratic president since, well I don&#x27;t even know who. He&#x27;s the second-coming of Reagan on that front. He has no reason to view this as anything other than some NSA programs that stepped out of line and need to step back on the right side of the line.",1377126498

Unfortunately, I was looking for something more than just &quot;do a lot of work and do it well&quot;... but I might just be wishing for something too good to be true!<p>On a related note, one of my favourite features of the Stripe webhooks is the UI for showing logs/events/etc. Makes developing SO MUCH easier when it&#x27;s not just some magic black box.",1377126137

I would guess that today you would not dream of going to the first two - simply because your strengths lie in JS.<p>You have specialised - and as such become more valuable.  But you could have specialised in many things other than language and still gotten good jobs.  A specialist commands more money, due to scarcity and percieved increase in the probability of success.<p>However I still think patio11 is <i>also</i> right - of two equally qualified specialists, one that is better at marketing and promotion and negotiation is going to do drastically better.<p>But no matter how good Ramit Sethi is on negotiation, if he goes for a C++ job he is not going to beat out a specialist even if the specialist just says yes to the first offer.<p>(Little assumption there about Ramit&#x27;s C++ skillz)",1377126008

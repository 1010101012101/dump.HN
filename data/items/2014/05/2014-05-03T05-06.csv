It uses the RabbitMQ library[1][2] and Acid-state library[3] to have a per-node config-DB and uses RabbitMQ&#x27;s guarantees for delivery of updates to the nodes.  Messages are serialised using Aeson[4], the Haskell JSON library.  I implemented a vector-clock versioning system on top of the Acid-state store to allow the clients to do conflict resolution.  It really was a joy to write (around 350 lines of code).  The C# client less so, 1000s of lines of boilerplate.<p>I think there&#x27;s something really impressive about haskell; I tend to have significantly more trust in the code I write because mostly I know the edge cases don&#x27;t exist.  9 times out of 10 if your code compiles it will work.

This would be true until the first time you called a C-FFI function that took a full CPU-second to return. Then all the other tasks in your system would wake up wondering what year it is and how their beards grew so long. Erlang added &quot;dirty schedulers&quot; (basically, extra scheduler-threads that will get spawned above-and-beyond the default one-per-core-with-CPU-affinity set) precisely so the preemption of CPU-heavy tasks could be pushed off into the OS&#x27;s capable hands.",1399096244

7689779,comment,7689402,7689516,8,0,mietek,,,"Haskell is great for DSLs.  Some loose thoughts:<p>- The syntax is clean and extensible.  (Function application is `f(x)` in C, `(f x)` in Lisp, and `f x` in Haskell.)<p>- The core language is small, with a suprising amount of functionality implemented as library functions.  (Not surprising to a Lisp programmer, though.)<p>- You can define your own infix operators, specify their precedence, and their fixity.  (Left, like most mathematical operators, or right, like the exponentiation operator).<p>- Because of Haskell&#x27;s lazy evaluation, there is no distinction between special and non-special forms, so you don&#x27;t need macros to build up syntactic sugar for your DSL.  (Special forms, such as the C short-circuiting operators `&&` and `||`, only evaluate as much as is necessary, which is what Haskell does across the board.)<p>- But if you really want macros or quasi-quotation, they&#x27;re part of the language.  (Macros are named Template Haskell.)<p>- There is also built-in syntactic sugar which can be re-used for your own instances of common program patterns, such as monadic do-notation, monadic comprehensions, and arrows.<p>There are many examples of Haskell DSLs online.  A particularly amusing one is Lennart Augustsson&#x27;s embedding of BASIC in Haskell, proving beyond all doubt that Haskell is in fact an imperative language, and all this talk about purity is poppycock. [1] [2]<p>Haskell is also great for performance.  GHC 7.8.2 is now ready to use, with the Mio high-performance multicore IO manager merged in. [3]  The composable nature of Haskell also lends itself to surprisingly powerful optimisations. [4]<p>Now, generating code at runtime and integrating it (interpreted, or even compiled) into the running image is definitely a strength of Lisp, and other under-appreciated artefacts of a future past, such as Smalltalk.  I do not know how Haskell fares in this area, but I would like to find out.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://augustss.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/regression-they-say-that-as-you-get.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://augustss.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/regression-they-say-t...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://augustss.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/more-basic-not-that-anybody-should-care.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://augustss.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/more-basic-not-that-a...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hask035-voellmy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hask03...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/ndp/haskell-beats-C.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers...</a>",1399096046

The fact that this is possible, regardless of the content of the sound bite, should be very scary to anyone interested in maintaining free dialogue.<p>Free dialogue necessarily requires people to feel capable of expressing very unpopular things without major ramifications.

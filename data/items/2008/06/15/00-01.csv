Because he was on TV tricking america and laughing and playing and making people like the parent comment think he was all sunshine and jolly ranchers while at the same time he provided cover for people committing crimes against humanity.<p>Having malice towards people who let people like Dick Cheney get away with hurting hundreds of thousands of people is part of a well developed, integrated sense of humanity.<p>My hatred for people like him flows from a deeper place of great love for all beings.<p>(BTW: For what it's worth, One less fevered ego... and the hate parts were based on bill hicks quotes I liked.  I don't know if that changes the implication or not.)",1213491595

Argue your point, forcefully, and let the people you think are wrong downvote you.  It tells you more about them, then you, if you are right, and if you are wrong you can learn things.

The dropdowns would have various positive categories ""agree"", ""insightful"", ""humorous"", etc. and various negative categories, ""disagree"", ""inane"", ""troll"", etc.<p>Instead of clicking up or down, you click the positive or negative attribute you use to categorize the comment.<p>What with clicking the drop-down, it's a two click system instead of a one-click system, but heck, to me it makes a lot more sense.",1213489728

As a moderator (with the down arrow), you have the responsibility to be generous with where others are taking the discussion.<p>Slashdot does meta-moderating, but it works because downvotes and upvotes have categories that it's possible for a relatively neutral observer to agree and disagree with. Here, there's a lot of ambiguity when you upvote or downvote.",1213489080

And the biggest picture of all, IMO, is other people.  The bits and bytes are cool, but it's the difference they make in other people's lives that keeps me going.<p>I don't know whether this thread is appropriate for hacker news, but I do know that some of the comments here are totally inappropriate in <i>any</i> forum.  Frankly, I'm a little embarassed for our community (I'm glad he's dead - wtf?)<p>Politics, religion, sports, and popular culture belong on other boards.

217778,comment,217591,217769,0,0,LPTS,,,"Unable to separate the disease from the doctor?  A doctor would not assume that all information he got from direct contact from the disease was not to be used in fighting the disease.  It was his personal rule to have communications default to off the record.  Don't worry if you're talking to Tim and you screw up.  He'll even take it off the record after the fact.  That's why Cheney's communications office thought his show was the best alternative to control the message.  That's why, and how, he got access, and that's what made him so useful to those that were granting him access.  That's not being one of the doctors treating the disease.<p>Did Bill Moyers or Jim Lehrer do better?  I bet, but then they don't get access.",1213488962

The only way to enforce norms about how generic up/down voting should be used, that are not implied by the interface itself, is to constantly comment on uses of voting that are suspected to be illegitimate and to start threads like this one.<p>After seeing several such threads, I suspect that, at best, you will only be able to convince a fraction of the community to conform to whatever norms you think are best.  Everyone else will simply use the up/down arrows as a catchall for any positive or negative sentiment they feel like expressing.  Total conversion is pretty much impossible, partly because some people will disagree with those norms, and newcomers will be oblivious to them.<p>In my opinion, there are much bigger problems here than how up/down votes are used.  Constant submission and upvoting of news that's utterly irrelevant to hacker-entrepreneurs is one.",1213488847

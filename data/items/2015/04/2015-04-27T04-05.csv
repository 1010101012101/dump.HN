9444441,comment,9443200,9444198,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"Hmm, I don&#x27;t think anyone seriously believes that a system where you can&#x27;t choose your job would be superior to capitalism (after all, it wouldn&#x27;t be very free). I think a more serious competitor is one where the underpinnings of capitalism remain in place, but some form of wealth distribution prevents all the gains from accumulating at the top (our current and probably dire within a few decades situation).<p>For example, after world war two, the top tax rate was 90% and the world didn&#x27;t end. This decimated the concentrations of wealth at the upper reaches of society and excessive luxury spending plummeted (for instance, once basic needs are satisfied, rich people start trading around excessively expensive pieces of art or excessively large houses). It, amongst other policies, also broke the intergenerational passage of wealth. However, it didn&#x27;t remove the temptation to still create wealth. Think of it like playing a game on hard mode, you only get 1/10th the points a n00b gets, but you can still increase your relative position compared to others (which is what I assume rich people really care about when it comes to personal finances).<p>I&#x27;m not advocating a particular course of action, but it seems the current course is unsustainable and similar things have been done successfully before. The political rhetoric is out of control these days though.<p>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, guitars and canvases don&#x27;t really cost that much. ;)<p>EDIT: Thinking about this, what if we explicitly posed tax rates as validations of people&#x27;s success and allowed them to get &quot;achievements&quot; past a certain point? Then playing the game at a harder difficulty would be a badge of prestige.  This sounds a little crazy here, but in, e.g. the netherlands has entirely public tax returns and it&#x27;s been debated and enacted here at various times: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/business/yourtaxes/14disclose.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/business/yourtaxes/14discl...</a>",1430110523

External recruiting agencies can cost somewhere in the range of 15-25% of the candidate&#x27;s first year&#x27;s salary. You can see how referrals would make a lot of sense from just a financial standpoint. There are other benefits though - for one, referrals have a higher likelihood of responding to outreach, making it through the interview process, fitting in, and sticking around. I&#x27;m sure the referrer doesn&#x27;t mind the extra dough either :)<p>In terms of referral bonus amounts, my company (PagerDuty, YC S10) offers between $5K and $20K depending on the role and priority. This includes engineering roles as well. The cool thing is we pay out for external referrals. Anyone can send a referral our way and if a hire is made, you&#x27;ll get paid the full amount.

In the campaigns I have administered (after the incident that the article reported), I&#x27;ve created carefully targeted campaigns with high-quality copy. The New Republic article, however, discusses our first campaign, which was unfortunately low-quality and poorly targeted.

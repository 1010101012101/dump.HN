The Federal Reserve lent $16 trillion in <i>total transactions</i> at the primary credit interest rate to banks over years worth of time. This number is clearly cited to provoke populist rage but is completely ridiculous when analyzed intellectually.<p>Look, consider this analogous situation. You're having trouble meeting your short term debts but had a solid line of income so you come to me and say, ""I need $10 for lunch today but I can pay you from my paycheck at the of the day."" I know you have a job and confirm your paycheck so I say, ""OK. I'll lend you the money."" So Monday comes and goes and you pay me back. Now, times are tough so you have to do this for a full 2 weeks before you can get back on your feet. During this time I lent you $10 on Monday, got payed back on Monday, $10 on Tuesday, etc. At the end of the two weeks would it be accurate to say I lent out $100? No, because I only really lent out $10 at a time. In fact, I really just lent out the same $10 ten times.<p>This is exactly the same situation. The $16 trillion is in total amount of money lent but it doesn't actually reflect any amount of money lent at any given time.",1313387905

He's pretending he doesn't pay very many taxes, but he does, he just pays different taxes. In this article he mentions capital gains, income, and payroll taxes but does not mention corporate income taxes. Corporate income taxes are taxes on the owners of corporations. I don't know exactly how much he paid, but some quick math I'd guess he alone paid 1.6 billion last year in corporate income taxes. (Berkshire paid 5.6 billion, Warren's worth 53 billion, Berkshire 178 billion, giving Warren 29% ownership, if you have better numbers feel free to share). So he mentions 6 million dollars in taxes but omits 1.6 billion from the discussion.",1313387593
2885708,comment,2877563,2885219,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Seriously?  It's not about me.  It's about that book.  For my remarks, you will have to look at them and not at me.<p>I nailed them on their description that the simplex algorithm was like Gaussian elimination for systems of linear inequalities.<p>No, The simplex algorithm is selecting elementary row operations to improve the value of the objective function.<p>Gaussian elimination also uses elementary row operations, but that is about the end of the direct connection.  In particular, how Gaussian elimination selects elementary row operations is quite different from how simplex selects them.<p>For more detail, I explained the role of artificial variables where we just 'glue on' an identity matrix.  So, since we just glue on an identity matrix, we never, directly in simplex, go through anything like Gaussian elimination to GET an identity matrix.  Yes, at times, for numerical reasons, one should 'reinvert' the basis in simplex, and here Gaussian elimination, etc., might be used, but such 'reinversion' is not really simplex.<p>The authors mentioned Gaussian elimination when they should have mentioned elementary row operations.  Next, what is special about simplex is improving the objective function, not working with linear inequalities.  Indeed, simplex doesn't work with linear inequalities; instead, we just use 'slack' and 'surplus' variables to get a system of linear equalities (with non-negative variables) before simplex even gets the problem.<p>The authors were being sloppy.  I called them out on it.  It was appropriate that I do so.<p>If you believe that my remarks about simplex are in error, then by all means make your claims.<p>But the issue is not me; it's the book.",1313387578

2885693,comment,2851470,2854202,2,0,MissBridgit,,,"Have to say something.  Using statistics to quantify a change in IQ based SES is similar to using statistics to show that an algae bloom is due to increased sunlight only.  The drop in IQ has more to do with limiting educational opportunities and community supports for struggling families.  Yes, our government has let us down in many ways but it is a generational problem of trying to give the people what they need to survive and be successful without the people really understanding what it truly is, to be successful.  Mass media promotes an idea of success that is NOT successful in terms of true human success and the average Joe buys into such fallacies.  It should never be a handout but a hand up to a better life, short term, look for solutions, educate, change, move on.  If that is not possible for a ""family"" to do this, it needs to be discovered specifically why, not just surface appearances of what may truly be stopping appropriate growth and development of the human being.  It is never one thing only, there is always a system involved and the system is broken somewhere along the way preventing it from working entirely successfully. Who said it takes a VIllage?  It really does, a whole village of people concentrated on the development of each individual within that village to ultimate success and success does not equal money or power unless it is a means to an end for change and a better future for all.
1. topnotch prenatal care for all
2. topnotch education and services from birth, identifying potential problems in development right from the start and providing supports to prevent issues
3. Proper diet and nutrition education and availability, across the board
4. Fewer identifiers of low SES on a daily basis for growing children to prevent the stigma from pushing them into poor decision making.
5. A village for every child<p>It is all out there, you have to fight for it sometimes and sometimes you are treated with suspicion just because you want to fight for it, but in the end, it will always be worth it, for posterity's sake.",1313387106

2885689,comment,2884268,2884864,1,0,CognitiveLens,,,"That's probably a fair general characterization of what is going on, but the core part is that our perceptual systems respond primarily to change - if things in our field of vision are not changing, they produce less of a ""signal"" in our brains. It's not our perceptual system that is switching modes as much as it is the world changing between active and static.<p>In the MIB case, most of the field of view is constantly changing, providing a lot of signal, but the yellow dots are low signal, and so our brains happily fill in the static dots with the in-motion background around it. Moving your eyes, blinking, or moving your head around all introduce enough visual change to re-set the full visual field, which is why the yellow dots reappear.<p>Through top-down attentional control, you can have some influence over whether/which dots disappear - in effect, you are turning up the signal gain on particular receptors in the visual field around the target dots.<p>You can also see why this affects people with monocular vision just as well - a lot of this perceptual processing happens at a very low level, well before binocular cues get integrated.",1313387079

Maybe $100,000/year would do it in most parts of the country?  And probably a lot less.<p>Now suppose you had a million dollars (and <i>just</i> a million, ignoring these billionaires for the moment).  That mean you could risk, without really blinking an eye, $900,000 on any investment; even if you lost every penny, you'd still be left with enough to live ""well"" and feel pretty ""rich"".  At no point would you fear missing your next meal or losing the roof over your head, and you probably wouldn't care if you had a job.  Of course, the odds of losing all $900,000 are slim; you'd probably see some payoff, and never really approach that unfortunate low.<p>Rich people will <i>always</i> have opportunities to make money that the poor will never have.  Even if you tax a millionaire or billionaire at a very high rate, they'll have enough money left over to take many risks and <i>very likely end up richer anyway</i>.  At the very least, they won't miss the money that went to taxes.<p>Now suppose you only make $15,000/year.  Not only would it take <i>years</i> to reach the above ""rich"" $100,000 level, but you'd be insane to risk much of that low income on any investment: failure means you come out with <i>zero</i> and miss your next meal and lose your house.

The demographic was somewhat limited by technical and geographic constraints but Sam figured out a way to broaden (a small portion of) the benefits to a wider audience. To my mind that is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the original experiment (i.e. spreading goodwill and kindness).<p>Also, it's worth noting that Sam did not explicitly moralize about this - other than to say that he didn't ""find the idea of yuppies buying yuppies coffees very interesting"".<p>Can anyone explain why it has provoked such an aggressive response?<p>EDIT: I've no connection with Jonathan or Sam or Starbucks (really).",1313384492

We could raise taxes to invest in infrastructure, which would increase future GDP.  A charity cannot do this owing to eminent domain issues.<p>That's the real rub about this deficit/debt limit drama: it wouldn't be so bad if the government spent in areas to increase future GDP.  However, the government is basically an old-age insurance program with a large army.  I don't see these expenditures contributing greatly to future GDP.",1313384490

2885551,comment,2884431,2884909,1,0,6ren,,,"Thanks. I can see how this would lead to ""derailments"", particularly if the story line was modeled as arcs (given it's a ""connectionist model""), but the ""delusions"" seem less obvious... unless things, including identities, were also modeled as arcs between different ways of referencing the same thing (e.g. my address, where I live, my home). Sort of using the same model for instances (events in a story) and schema (actors in a story) - which makes sense, and may well be how it works in the brain. Reuse, don't reinvent, is what nature does when it can.<p>I have doubts about Science based on making up computer models and seeing what happens (although it is a lot of fun to do). OTOH, they clearly casting this as merely a hypotheses - which is pretty reasonable.",1313384482

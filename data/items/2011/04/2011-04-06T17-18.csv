In general I find people who have no real value to add with usually criticize not the ideas but the person. It shows low self-esteem in my eyes.<p>My biggest beef working with start ups - they only focus on technology.<p>When I am doing sales and marketing for them the times I have succeed is when I figured out a well defined market that not only feels the pain but it actively looking for a solution and that also easy to reach. An example:
software security inspection software<p>Before I came, the company focused on VPs of engineering for SMB market. Now this is well defined. But no VP of engineering is going to say - oh we need to pay someone to find all the security breaches in our software. However I went after CEOs and VP of Sales - and angled it as 3rd verification if they are in the middle of strategic relationships: OEMs, exits for buyouts, selling to financial or insurance industry, or even working with Fortune 1000 companies. What a difference - we suddenly had their attention and were able to close some business quickly.<p>I am very good at B2B. But I refuse to sell anymore. I hate doing business with people are want the easy money and screw customers meaning they fail miserably in operations. They also think very badly of sales. Typically coders who have never sold, being a techie I have looked at some times at their code - for shame!<p>So I am on my own. I am trying the B2C market but have yet to succeed: 30 itunes apps, 3 websites, etc.<p>I am tempted to go back into B2B since that where my strengths are but I just want to a small shop so I am kinda stuck until I succeed :-)<p>Your point about not doing business in a domain that is not of your interest or expertise - valid point. I would suggest getting a partner that does have the domain expertise and enthusiasm. I know plenty of successful who are not enthusiastic about the industry they are in. And tons of CEOs who can not tell you a single benefit statement of why to use their product/service. It would be odd but to me it is normally. In front of customers, I always have to check my CEO to make sure they don't hang themselves.",1302112369

Nor are you as likely to spend as much time trying to define your market, identify your customers, and work out your acquisition costs.<p>In other words, your need to iterate is probably a lot lower, since and older founder is more likely to be operating with a measure of specialized or otherwise hard-to-get insight, and are aiming for something specific that isn't low-hanging fruit, and that may depend - critically - on well established relationships.<p>From what I understand, the tech world is one of the few places where founders are commonly so young.

E.g., anything that you'll find in the 10$ bargain bin when it first gets released<p>Macro Game - a group of people working together. It took a couple of years to put together. It is flawless, it's got a marketing campaign behind it and chances are it's going to get played by professional gamers and make a lot of people a lot of money. E.g., Starcraft, GTA, Quake<p>Nano games are < 10k, micro games are less than 100k and macro games anything more than 100k.<p>I would argue that the vast majority of games fall into the nano and micro camps.

Few people in their early 20's have had enough life experience to have developed these qualities.<p>The problem with the co-founder model is that when life is peachy everyone is working hard and having a good time.  However, when things turn ugly if all founders are not equipped to manage the situation it can easily turn in to a nightmare.  Things like not being able to make payroll, facing lawsuits, facing bankruptcy, catastrophic supply chain problems (manufacturing), etc. can easily create a set of conditions that can break apart a partnership that was great during good times.<p>While I will not dispute that having like-minded co-founders can be an advantage, I am of the opinion that --for a certain type of businesses-- I'd rather go solo than run the risk of partnering with someone who might become my worst enemy when things become difficult.

One of the major differences between alpha males and the rest of the population is that <i>they will always assume they'll end up in the top spot.</i>  Your prototypical alpha male won't even consider the odds of being on the bottom in that lottery.<p>To push it further,  those same aggressive types will have the passion and voice to draw support for their views, no matter the substance.  A ""flat"" structure overvalues the opinions of the loud and aggressive, with little room for more pensive contributors, especially women.<p>In other words, if you leave the authorship of the social contract to the loudest people, you may end up with a rather oppressive outcome.  This is a universal rule, often overlooked by the alpha males who spend their time talking to Inc. Magazine.",1302109238

Welcome!<p>You said, ""The problem is that relational databases (at least the ones that are available to us) are not at all fluid and flexible.""  Since I disagree with this and find you so eloquent in your arguments, I wonder if this debate is over ""semantics"".  I don't know what you think is ""available to us"", but I have worked for ages with RDBMS that are so stunningly fluid and flexible, they have never failed to deliver what I needed for any app.  Perhaps you haven't had the same opportunity (and joy).  Remember, just because it's relational doesn't mean it has to be Microsoft, Oracle, or open source.<p><a href=""http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/u2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/u2/</a><p><a href=""http://www.jbase.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jbase.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.rainingdata.com/products/dbms/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rainingdata.com/products/dbms/index.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.revelation.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.revelation.com/</a>",1206579492

My reason? I was actually reading this at school and I've had friends sign up who could really care less about anything about programming...and end up treating this site like its Slashdot. Perhaps similar episodes have occurred elsewhere?",1206578807

147439,comment,146860,147008,0,0,trevelyan,,,"One word: Fujitsu.<p>Just bought one of their S6410s. 13-inch screen ultralight with good performance and great battery life. Don't know if the machines are available in the US yet, but the laptop rocks. Small enough you can use it on a plane with the screen fully open, or throw it in a knapsack. Large enough to be my main computer, although I like to browse the web with F11.<p>My gripe with the Mac is that it's too expensive for what you get. I've never been inclined to put a laptop in a manilla envelope though, so I'd guess I'm not their market. Only problem with Fujitsu is that the company seems actively disinterested in selling their products (took ages to find a local reseller) and the company has literally nothing in the way of Linux support, not even ""unofficial"" drivers. They also do that awful ""backup as a partition"" that screws up when you repartition the hard drive to do things like install useful software.<p>Ubuntu is up and running now though, and it's great.",1206577933
147438,comment,146916,146916,0,0,phony_identity,,,"This is an evolved response, made for the paleolithic era.  Your brain thinks your tribe was just conquered by the neighboring tribe, and that your women and livestock have been taken.  Evolution thinks you're lucky to be alive, and the best way to preserve that is to lay low for a while and be submissive as possible.  The mechanism by which is does this is by temporarily cutting your testoterone level.  Your T is low, so you feel low and hopeless and the world seems a bit grey.<p>That was the smart move 50,000 years ago.  Not now.  You need to do things that bring the testosteroone back: hard exercise, especially weightlifting.  Try to arrange for plenty of small, guaranteed wins in anything you're good at: video games, basketball, trivial pursuit, whatever.  Get lots of sunlight!  That's an easy one that boosts testosterone.  There are probably other things that boost T.  Google.<p>Bravo for asking this question.  Great job in doing a startup in the first place.  Consider this a hearty slap on the back.",1206577892
147437,comment,147077,147077,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"His theses in the older article are that A) More complex relationships between more disparate data are becoming more useful; B) It's hard to establish new entity relationships or new entities in a relational database.<p>B) Not really true.  Learn relational theory.  It's definitely easier than updating  data structures, file formats, and all affected routines, which seems to be what he's suggesting.<p>A) True.  But absolutely nothing about this is easier to deal with by not using a database than by using a database.  Loads of new flatfiles, query APIs, graphs, and datamining algorithms don't mean it's time to throw out the DB.  It just means things are harder.",1206577753

Some were better looking and skinnier than others (Heysan, for example).  And the software dev shop I worked for in Austin, Texas was chock full of good looking dudes with good looking wives/girlfriends (and it had double nerd power--they developed scientific computing applications and had geologists and mathematicians who were also software developers).<p>Perhaps you haven't looked at the average American lately...",1206577675

Plus, the time-zone differences with, say, working with folks in India vs. working with folks in Canada is important.  It all boils down to competency, execution, and communication.  In some cases, it has worked very well for me.  In others, it has been horribly bad.  It's still a gamble today, as far as I'm concerned.",1206576315

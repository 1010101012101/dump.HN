Given that btrfs itself remains \na &quot;stabilizing, but not yet fully mature and stable filesystem&quot;, while \nbtrfs raid will often let you recover from a bad device, sometimes that \nrecovery is in the form of letting you mount ro, so you can access the \ndata and copy it elsewhere, before blowing away the filesystem and \nstarting over.<p>I have hotplug and online-replace with ZFS and mdraid. btrfs wants a special degraded remount that might or might not be able to recover to rw someday... replacing a disk online is not really possible. Handling a failing drive is not really implemented.<p>Don&#x27;t call it stable or don&#x27;t call it RAID. It&#x27;s nice that I&#x27;m able to pull of the data of my ro-mounted degraded array when a disk fails.. however all of this stuff is not really documented and was very surprising to me. If you have production machine e.g. on btrfs RAID10 it sucks to not be able to replace a broken drive on the fly online.<p>ZFS/mdraid just do it..<p>[RAID II]<p>> * The read scheduling algo is currently naive, using PID evenness to determine the disk in a pair to read, rather than current IO load on the disk.<p>> Did I miss something, or misunderstand something? If I didn&#x27;t miss anything, I don&#x27;t see how you can get &quot;RAID is utterly broken&quot; from &quot;RAID has less-than-optimal write and read scheduling&quot;.<p>Walking is a less than than optimal way to move from Moscow to Berlin. If I take a train I expect a train - btrfs is a train that occasionally stops and says: Well, just walk... okay, you see I&#x27;m kind of emotional invested in this shit. However it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s usually expected as RAID and it&#x27;s not documented.<p>We have here a lot of applications that do exactly that: a single PID reads lots of stuff very often sequentially... so RAID1 doubles throughput. Well not on btrfs.<p>[ENOSPC]<p>> I don&#x27;t run into those, and haven&#x27;t for literal years.<p>4x4TB RAID10 (90% free) -> ENOSPC - this was somehwere between 3.16 or 3.19 - how can this even happen?<p>[Corruption]<p>> I haven&#x27;t run into any, ever on the handful of systems on which I use BTRFS.<p>Good for you. \nWas hit by this nasty undeletable directory bug:  <a href=""http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg35789.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg35789.html</a><p>And then this: <a href=""http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg45108.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg45108.html</a><p>Umounting and running btrfs --check repair is not really cool if you want some uptime...<p>[Deadlocks]<p>Currently btrfs deadlocks reliable in a OOM situation... \nWith 4.2 things got better, before running some medium heavy Hadoop job or ElastichSearch indexing killed 20% to 50% of the machines due to deadlocks (with 3.19 IIRC)<p>> Look. I&#x27;m not saying that btrfs is feature-complete, suitable for every workload, or that any given person should use it for their workload. I&#x27;m just saying that the situation is far less dire than you&#x27;re making it out to be. I&#x27;ve been using it as the rootfs for at least one of my daily use systems for the past 5.5 years, and haven&#x27;t had any trouble out of it [3] in the past 2+ years.<p>It&#x27;s probably fine for personal use. But don&#x27;t think about using it for something that is demanding. You can google the presentations that say: Use it! It&#x27;s stable! Enterprise! It&#x27;s not.<p>Maybe in 5 years.

I recently attended DebConf 15, (the conference for Debian), and in an introductory session some long-time attendees were asked to express why they attended the conference.  What they said were things like “<i>This is where all my friends are.</i>” and I even heard someone say “<i>Debian is my family.</i>”.  This is emphatically <i>not</i> why I go to <i>any</i> conferences.  I go to conferences in order to advance the state of the field by listening to talks and getting to personally talk to people also working to advance the field, in this case the Debian GNU/Linux operating system distribution.<p>I <i>did</i> get a lot of that done, but this spirit of chummy familiarity was pervasive.  Every problem of getting people to cooperate and collaborate more was approached as a problem of not enough socializing.  But I <i>don’t</i> want to socialize with lots of random people.  I want to <i>make Debian more awesome</i>, not shoot the breeze with random people with wine and cheese (yes, DebConf has a Wine and Cheese event <i>in addition</i> to the large social outing).  Beyond having a title and summary for talks (and some rather narrowly scoped BoF sessions), there were <i>no</i> concerted efforts to get people in the same field of interest to get to speaking about common topics and solving common problems.  I voiced a complaint to someone about this, that in order to find anyone who was interested in the topics I wanted to discuss I would have had to basically randomly wander around and ask every person I met about what they did, which would have taken a lot of time and energy.  But the person I talked to saw it as a <i>good</i> thing to essentially force me to socialize with people <i>even though pure socializing was not my goal</i>.<p>Optimizing groups to be more social <i>to the detriment of all else</i> is <i>not</i> what you want to do if your group has any other overriding reason to exist beyond being a pure social club, since you exclude people who would rather work towards the group’s proclaimed goal than being social and chatting with friends.",1447620448

I often think of these as the core contributing past and current &quot;fathers&quot; and &quot;mothers&quot; of our industry, people ranging anywhere from Ada Lovelace to Vint Cerf.  Reality is, those core thinkers are probably where many of us learn from anyway - that and &quot;hacking/tinkering&quot; which is what many of us do and can still lead to progress too.<p>To me it&#x27;s all connected, but something about our community always holds us back... maybe there it is the element of not wanting to be forced into structure either.

See not religious,&quot; political&quot; goals.\nSame with islamophobia, these words are overused on the internet without people understanding them like the word inception(most people on the internet think it means a thing within a thing within a thing, its not that&#x27;s recursion) also like hashtag#, people started using hashtag everywhere, without knowing it&#x27;s use.<p>Second of all you can learn a little about different religions , but search using keywords like &quot;is Islam a religion of Peace&quot;, &quot; what are the basic teachings of Islam&quot; do not start by searching &quot; is the prophet of Islam a pedophile&quot; the keywords you use directly impact the results. So always look for legitimate information.<p>Next you can learn a little about psychology and learn why people do what they do. Now I&#x27;m not a expert on psychology, all I know about psychology comes from American TV shows(like criminal minds, law and order etc), one can question their accuracy and methods but its hard to miss the point. People do henious crimes coz of certain things that can scientifically explained. Regarding our current situation you can look into how Cults are formed and their inner working and ideology. A cult leader is some with leadership qualities, has brainwashing skills, Is very charming and motivational. The leaders just brainwash psycopaths, orphans, impressionable kids.\nOsama bin laden never wore a suicide west, he just coordinated and planned the attacks, his followers follow him blindly and there are reasons for that, well documented and researchered for you to read. Do you think that ISIS leaders actually go to ground zero to fight ?? They probably sit inside bunkers surrounded by all the things &quot;haram&quot; in Islam.<p>Next thing you can do is start questioning...\nQuestion how such a remote and cut off place is getting hi-tech western guns and ammunitions.\nHow are these guys getting funded.\nHow come Afghanistan is the largest producer of heroin, how they can snuggle heroin in US(biggest consumer of heroin) without the help of americans.\nThen you can ask why do these terrorist plan for years to coordinate something like 9/11 when they can burn oil wells in their own country and actually cripple western countries in a matter of days.<p>Don&#x27;t sleep on it, educate yourself on how modern society works , how money and power are so important and root cause of all evil.\nNot religion, Islam was founded in the middle East to fight evil like all other religions.\nAll religions are practically the same ..they all preach the same things with minute differces.<p>Just educate yourself more on current world affairs and remember there&#x27;s nothing wrong with any religion or country.\nIt&#x27;s all political propaganda for power and money.\nEvery such act is based on profit of the cult group and for the people funding them.<p>You can also help human beings who are suffering, its the best thing you can do, help anyone and everyone it&#x27;s the only things in your control , for things out of your control you cannot do anything, but you can always educate yourself and fight ignorance.<p>PS:English is not my first language.\nPS:I&#x27;m a kid so please refrain from blunt/harsh comments.",1447618708

When you&#x27;re putting things on faster hardware you&#x27;re moving yourself upwards along all axes, but when you add a type of computation (e.g. Mystery module) you&#x27;re introducing a new axis, capturing a wider volume of cognitive ability. In that sense the title is alluding to a cognitive step on the 1-D function of the total volume, not of any individual axis of it.

I&#x27;m refuting the humanitarian benefit touted by Facebook: &quot;people who wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford or access the Internet can access at least some parts of it&quot;. That&#x27;s wrong. People who can afford the Internet will be able to access it more freely, agreed. And I did say that that is a benefit, but not major, especially the way things are going with respect to connectivity and data costs.<p>And as countless others have mentioned in this thread, Internet.org is not the only solution in place that tries to provide this.",1447617986

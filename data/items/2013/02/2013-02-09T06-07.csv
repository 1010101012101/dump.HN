In public speaking, you are trained to take the common denominator, which to some extent ""dumbs down"" the message, but makes it more comprehensible by anyone.  Such a skill would be beneficial to a team, especially if you're trying to explain a bug to QA (who will never have to understand the underlying code), or propose a feature to a superior (will this earn us revenue?).

It's a foreign national funneling six figures across borders through multiple anonymous PayPal accounts even after being advised, by PayPal directly, to stop doing so. Above and beyond the breach of contract and ignoring PayPal's guidance to stop using a US account when he's not a US citizen or even in the US, the activity looks pretty much exactly like money laundering. On top of that, PayPal has its own legal obligations to the United States, which it can't fulfill since he's not providing a tax ID while he's passed the IRS reporting threshold by a factor of 10.<p>They closed his US account, which they gave him warning he wasn't supposed to be using. He hasn't claimed they are keeping any of his money, and they didn't stonewall him about why it's being closed.

What the journals offer is a branding that certain articles rise above a minimal level threshold of value, and a central point of accessing such articles.<p>Nobody is forced to use their service. Your point that untenured professors must ""publish or perish"" doesn't fully analyze the situation. Tenure committees have no intrinsic reason to favor these publishers. They care only to the extent that these publishers have the brand that signals to them and others: ""hey, this author doesn't completely suck.""<p>Now, the publishers largely inherited these brands, from back when publishing was a more involved process involving paper. But there is nothing nefarious keeping them in the system. Any open access publisher could rise up tomorrow and as long as they could develop the brand and signaling power they could take on the publishers. But regardless of anything else, branding, sorting, filtering, and signaling are things people want, even more than free and easy access to information. And the publishers stay in the loop because they offer those things.",1360390788

What part of having a really spiffy site on the internet instantly translates into someone running a legitimate company rather than a shell corporation?<p>To be frank, you're talking out of your ass here. You have no idea of the problems that paypal is facing, and you are imaging that frozen funds are somehow identical to profit for paypal. That's not the case at all. In reality paypal has to deal with a veritable army of fraudsters and organized crime members on a daily basis. And they are hugely sophisticated, well funded, and impressively capable. Paypal's successes against such folks happen in the dark, because typically these guys aren't going to go blogging and tweeting up a storm about how paypal shut down their international money laundering operation. But it happens all the time. And that's why paypal is often so aggressive in these cases. Because they've seen the ""clueless international student with a side-business and no paperwork but a really fancy website"" gambit played out a thousand times already. How do you tell the difference?<p>Easy, when the legitimate operation goes and gets its legal issues sorted out, gets a business license, gets a tax ID, EID, inputs an SSN, etc. and sorts out any other legal or ToS violations they have then paypal won't have a cause for freezing the funds anymore.<p>Now, you might say that we should change the rules, and make it easier for anyone and everyone to toss around hundreds of thousands of dollars across international borders without any documentation or the involvement of any sort of registered business entity. I'm somewhat sympathetic to such notions, but such changes would entail a plethora of complex and thorny ramifications that I think most people who implicitly hold such ideals almost certainly haven't thought through.<p>There is one complaint against paypal that is sensible and backed up by evidence, and that is that they often have crappy customer service. That does indeed suck, and it aggravates these sorts of situations beyond a level that is reasonable, and, of course, generates a lot of antipathy toward paypal that isn't fully warranted.<p>If people want to switch to paypal alternatives, they are certainly able to try. Of course, one wonders why there are so few which have a global reach and the convenience of paypal. It couldn't be that the problem of peer-to-peer international payments is at its core fundamentally quite difficult and that only one company has done the immensely challenging work to actually make it possible, could it?<p>Surely not.<p>Paypal sux.",1360390417

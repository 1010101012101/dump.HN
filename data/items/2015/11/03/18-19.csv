You believe voting in those districts matters? Oh we should spend our time in long and arcane primary votes?

10501693,comment,10491649,10491649,0,0,bpatrianakos,,,"These are all great ideas. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these types of projects/guidelines is the almost religious, strict adherence to them that some people who pick them up like to rant about.<p>The examples are great and realistic but they will inevitably break down in any project with just a moderate amount of complexity. When this happens I see people decide that they&#x27;ve done something wrong and think they either need to restructure the UI to fit the guidelines or find a different set of guidelines to fit their project. Both are wrong.<p>After years of studying these guidelines and trying to perfect the perfect, most efficient, small, and understandable set of CSS styles I&#x27;ve come to the realization that we need to simply accept that there are going to be exceptions and that&#x27;s okay. Yes, think in components, give classes sane names, don&#x27;t use ID attributes, etc. but also know that at some point you&#x27;re probably going to have to break a rule and it&#x27;s not the end of the world. Think about the problem for a few minutes but don&#x27;t waste your time trying to shoehorn your front end code to fit a set of guidelines so you can feel superior because of your strict adherence to RCSS or SUITCSS or whatever. There are more pressing issues than a few unused or single use classes. If you can follow the rules more than 80% of the time then I say you&#x27;re as close to perfect as you&#x27;ll ever be. Anything else is reaching for an impossible standard.<p>It&#x27;s funny that the stricter you adhere to some of these guidelines the less productive you become as you spend more time thinking about how to create components so they fit the rules rather than getting the damn styles to look however you want.<p>My point being this: I love all the different philosophies and think they&#x27;re all worth studying but let&#x27;s be realistic when it comes time to implement stuff.",1446577023

However this has a variety of issues, including but not limited to getting the big email services (especially gmail, ironically) to trust your server as a non-spam gateway. Part of the problem here is that running a quality email service isn&#x27;t cheap, and I&#x27;m not sure how much I&#x27;d have to trust a provider for it to be worth ditching google as my provider.

If you learn x86 assembly language and read the x86 reference manual from Intel (which tells you what effect each instruction has on the CPU&#x27;s state), you too could write one. A basic overview of computer architecture would also be helpful (the author provides some references at the top of the file). It could take a few years to get that knowledge (depending on how much you already know), but not a lifetime. It looks like a lot of code, but that&#x27;s because the x86 architecture has a lot of machine instructions.

Subdivision coupled with looser coordination and knowledge exchange means systemic failure at the top of each system can be contained by leaning on the others. E.g. the UK National Health Service is split into many &quot;trusts&quot; and failing trusts are often either put under the control  - temporarily or long term - of successful ones, or given more focused support from surrounding trusts to get back on track. Any number of trusts can be badly mismanaged without creating existential threats to the health service as a whole.<p>The larger the overall system, the more such trusts can be run at whatever the ideal scale is for optimizing system cost rather than having to scale them down to spread the risk; and the more such trusts, the easier it becomes to absorb individual failures without too big effects on surrounding ones.",1446576471

This issue is very close to my heart, due to harsh and difficult to overcome life experiences.<p>The ACA is what was possible at the time it was enacted.  One party holding a blanket &quot;no&quot; position very seriously diluted what was actually possible.  Most notably, the opposition wasn&#x27;t over a better way.  It was all about simply not beginning the process to improve.  Today, that opposition is pointing to tepid results, and they are right about those results, while completely ignoring their reasoned and deliberate efforts to insure the results are tepid at best.<p>They desire failure in the hopes that we can return to ignoring this problem, not that they have a better vision, or can contribute in some other meaningful way.<p>Understanding that is important.<p>Really, the most meaningful aspect of the ACA is that it represents us getting started on health care reform long overdue.  Popular support for the idea of improving health care runs consistently high.  Our costs are roughly 2X above the second most expensive system in the world and are not sustainable.  Most of us feel this impact, and the need to improve is obvious.<p>A handful of votes would have transformed the ACA from the tepid legislation is is today.  One notable omission is public, &quot;cost plus&quot; insurance access, potentially a Medicare buy in plan.  This would have done a lot to improve on price control and foster competition as well as experimentation with public, &quot;cost plus&quot; type delivery systems too.  We could take care of a lot of people for a lot less money given just a little innovation in this space.  Some nations get by on tech from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s and have overall outcomes comparable and, in some cases, better than our aggregate outcomes now.<p>Regardless of where you stand on all of that, the reality is we finally got started.  40 years overdue.  And it&#x27;s all a little bit better now in aggregate, and life changing for some 20 million plus Americans today.<p>Now that we have started, it&#x27;s time to improve on the ACA, and the more we do and the sooner we do it, the better off we all will be.  That&#x27;s the real message.<p>Don&#x27;t like the ACA?  Great!  Neither do I.  We had to get started somewhere, and the ACA was that possible start, diluted only by people unwilling to actually start to do the work to improve this for everyone.<p>The question really isn&#x27;t repeal or not.  The question is how to continue to improve.  Given the costs, we need to very seriously improve.<p>There is no death spiral.  The ACA is working as intended and it&#x27;s doing a lot of people real good in terms of access to health care and debt / bankruptcy related to health care.  Had the ACA been law a few years before, I would have been able to avoid the choice between losing everything, or losing somebody I love.<p>Of course, she is still here, and that is good, but my financial life will never be the same.  Just imagine all your gains, home, etc... gone at 40 something.  That is what happens to people.  And it still does, but the ACA puts some real options out there that really do help a lot of people avoid that scenario and doing that is really worth it.  I know my life would be very different today had the ACA been law.<p>It&#x27;s easy for people of means, or who have good insurance through their employer, etc... to rage on about the &quot;injustice&quot; of the ACA.  Whatever.  No joke there.  I really am being dismissive, because the value of getting started on this problem in the USA really is as big of a deal as proponents make it out to be.<p>It&#x27;s much harder to talk about fact based, data driven rational policy intended to improve the deplorable state of health care policy in the USA today.  Quite frankly, it&#x27;s not enough to repeal.  The end game on that is unacceptable to the vast majority of Americans.<p>No, the real denial is over the great need to continue the journey we started with the ACA.  A &quot;replace&quot; type proposal is plausible.  An &quot;improve&quot; type proposal is likely possible and practical.<p>Repeal is a dead end with no meaningful end game for anyone really.",1446575729

At Teespring, “full stack” means anything from warehouse management systems to our 3rd party API to the number crunching analytics behind our campaign dashboards. It’s up to you to pick the challenge which excites you the most!<p>What is the job?\nWe take code quality and engineering efficiency seriously. Engineers pair about 50% of the time, and we have a robust but lightweight code review process to disseminate knowledge. Nothing goes to production without automated testing. We do 2-week sprints, with engineers&#x27; input a key part of the planning process. Your expert input will also be considered when planning new feature work: both in terms of implementation decisions, and product experience.<p>Who is the ideal candidate?\nA passionate programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are a definite boon, since many features have some user interface component. Deep, professional experience with Rails will be especially useful. A person with strong opinions, weakly-held.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now:\n Your team-mates will look to you for technical advice, guidance, and mentorship. You will have architected and led the creation of a significant piece of the team’s technology. Our collaborative environment and generous training budget will have substantially enriched your technical abilities. You will be speaking as an expert in your field at conferences and meetups.<p>Our Environment:\nModern Rails Stack, React.js, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Golang. A big push towards CD and SOA at the moment.<p>What do we offer?\nHappiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive: working with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams. Medical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, and pet. Unlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays. Generous stock options. Free (delicious) catered lunch and dinner daily. Fully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar. Training, career development, and meet-up hosting. Fun SOMA office offering easy access to Muni, Bart, and Caltrain with commuter benefits.

Firefighters routinely fought fires without SCBA up until at least the 70&#x27;s, and probably into the 80&#x27;s in rural areas.  And if they weren&#x27;t using SCBA for structure fires, they probably weren&#x27;t using them for rescue calls in most cases.  It was a cultural thing... for a long time, firefighters just didn&#x27;t understand/appreciate the importance of SCBA.  In hindsight that seems hard to believe, but it&#x27;s been a slow process to get to a place where every firefighter is rigorous about making sure they use SCBA at all required times.  (To some extent, that could be said about other protective gear as well, including turnout gear and PASS alarms).<p>Also consider that many (probably most) fire departments don&#x27;t receive a lot of specific training on confined space rescue.   Of course, you might ask, &quot;why not?&quot; and the simple answer is &quot;time&quot;.  Especially with volunteer firefighters, you can only get folks out for so much training a week.  And fire calls are many times more common than confined space calls, so most training time is spent on the routine firefighting stuff.<p>Similar thing with hazardous materials training...  it&#x27;s a relatively recent thing for the majority of fire departments to receive specific haz-mat training, and even then, unless the department runs a specialized haz-mat team, their personnel probably only train to the &quot;awareness&quot; level.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to excuse the fire chief, as I don&#x27;t know the details of that specific story.  But for something like that to happen, especially that many years ago, isn&#x27;t a <i>complete</i> surprise.<p>Source: I was a firefighter and certified firefighting instructor throughout most of the 90s / early 2000&#x27;s.  My dad was also a volunteer firefighter and I&#x27;ve had a lifelong interest in the fire service.",1446573748

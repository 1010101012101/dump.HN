The problem is the focus is on end of life treatment which is the most expensive.  50% of all heath care is paid for by the US Government / taxpayers the other half is a mix of out of pocket and private insurance.",1248613161
724359,comment,724272,724347,0,0,mellis,,,"What makes you think insurance companies spend money efficiently?<p>For one thing, they tend to have much higher administrative costs than publicly run health care programs.  See, for example, Wikipedia's article on health care in the US: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States#Administrative_costs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_State...</a> or this blog post by Ezra Klein: <a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/07/administrative_costs_in_health.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/07/administ...</a><p>There are also all the reasons cited in Krugman's post.<p>Then there's the fact that the U.S. spends about twice as much on health care as any other developed nation and gets results that aren't clearly better overall.  Is it a coincidence that we have the largest component of private spending?<p>If the insurance companies aren't already good at spending money on health care, what makes anyone think that if you give them the whole system to run, it will be any better?",1248613043

724356,comment,724272,724336,0,0,Retric,,,"I actually support the opposite model.  Public heath care funding for generic drugs / cheep new drugs and basic heath care.  Private insurance for extremely expensive drugs, experimental or high risk treatments, and life support once you are brain dead.<p>The first 20% of heath care spending goes increasingly far.  The last 20% is pure waste.  The problem is people want to try and help the old live forever so medicare is a black hole that will suck this country dry.  Unfortunately I don't think we are going to have a cap on spending if you have less than a 20% chance of being alive in one year.<p>PS: Want to make heath care cheaper pay for the first 100$ of any drug / month if and only if it has zero advertising.",1248612802

I consider their predicament a disease and I truly feel sorry for them. However, as long as we can not cure that illness (and we can't afaik), the safety of my children and relatives comes first. I believe the point of laws and crime deterrents should not be to ""even out the guilt"", it should be to prevent crimes from happening (Edit: that's of course a broad generalization, a balance has to be found between preventing crimes and overly restrictive laws. Hopefully the experts on psychology etc. can find the appropriate judgement).<p>(Note: obviously I don't talk about urinating in public and kissing your sweetheart when you were 17).",1248612466

A lot of business success depends on who you meet, and how you get on with them, rather than how well you build your product. If you're totally anti-social, you'll probably miss out on a lot of potential business contacts that could make or break your business, no matter how good your product is.",1248612350

One one hand, I like the idea of a free, good resource and a gentle introduction for those who need it, and on the other hand, I fear that some people really shouldn't be exposed to programming in the first place, and too gentle an introduction leaves them with an unwarranted feeling that they actually know what they're doing.

Doctors can prescribe an unnecessary procedure because they're paid for it or because they fear malpractice claims.  Or they can prescribe an expensive drug or surgery with a high chance of saving your life.  In America, we don't do a very efficient job of spending our health care dollars.  In Denmark (where I'm living now), you may or may not get treatment as good as in an American hospital (you should try some of the public ones before you judge).  At least you get the treatment you need regardless of your ability to pay, and without bankrupting you in the process.",1248612009

If we had a system by which taxation had some sort of optional element (e.g. it's up to you but if you don't pay you can't vote) then we could debate the morality of taxation.

724340,comment,724272,724272,0,0,cwan,,,"""There are, however, no examples of successful health care based on the principles of the free market, for one simple reason: in health care, the free market just doesnâ€™t work. And people who say that the market is the answer are flying in the face of both theory and overwhelming evidence.""<p>I'm quite curious where it has even been attempted (I'm assuming that Krugman is aware that it's difficult to prove a negative).  There are submarkets where markets are being tried - prescription eye glasses for instance.<p>There are all types of insurance that cover complicated risks as well - this doesn't mean they are uninsurable (excess of loss coverage on any variety of things).  But I think Krugman's biggest failings is in making a convincing argument that all healthcare is necessarily expensive.  Back to the prescription eyeglass example - where the competition between opticians, optometrists and ophthalmologists have made costs rise considerably less than healthcare costs as a whole.  Further, if you look at the innovations in ambulatory care centers, there have been dramatic reductions in costs.<p>Finally, let's also be reasonable about government run healthcare that has its own set of issues with spiraling costs and often lower standards of care.  As a Canadian, you often see the effects of rationing - ie people wait.  People die in the waiting line.  The system is still quite expensive and is set to become even more so given demographics.  It is however an interesting debate - where I worry though is given the US is the dominant innovator in healthcare, will the tinkerings to how and what incentives are offered dramatically reduce innovation?  Despite being an obviously imperfect system (which one is perfect for that matter?), most Americans at least say they are satisfied with their own healthcare insurance.  Are these really then acceptable tradeoffs to move to a largely government run system - especially given the level of competence we have seen them run the recent stimulus packages?",1248611353

That way if technology makes what used to be expensive treatments easy and cheap they can be pushed into the private market.<p>Don't know, it's a tough nut to crack.",1248610869

Since it's iterate process its gets better by time and goes well with agile development.<p>At first your goal is to define your assumptions, test them with potential customers and gather facts. Next integrate the facts into your product development. Continue verifying your product and business with customers, start your sales and go-to-market activities.

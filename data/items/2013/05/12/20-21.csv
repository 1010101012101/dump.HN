5695811,comment,5693365,5693365,2,0,eschaton,,,"""[M]ulti GPUs may not have existed when XP was released""<p>The NT kernel had been shipping for about 10 years by the time XP was released. Windows NT 3.5 and earlier didn't have any kernel-level graphics (though they did have kernel-level drivers); kernel-level GDI came in NT 4 (1995-1996)  for performance.<p>Windows NT was also used by some graphics workstation vendors like Intergraph and SGI, whom I presume did support multiple GPUs like most workstation vendors did.<p>Macs also had actual GPUs (not just frame buffers, but real QuickDraw accelerators) and supported multiple GPUs in the late 1980s - on System 6!<p>All it really takes is a reasonable display abstraction model/API, and an ability for that to interface reasonably with hardware drivers. Seems Linux could've handled that too - and it wouldn't surprise me if it did, at least theoretically.<p>I didn't follow Linux's initial development as 386BSD had already come out. I do remember the first accelerated X11 for 386BSD supporting some card with a number like 911. I don't recall that it required explicit kernel support, other than perhaps a bunch of ioctl calls or something like that.",1368392353

It is very easy to replace Google apps commonly found on Android phones (such as Gmail, Google Maps, Google Talk, etc.) with non-Google apps. If Google's services start to get shitty, manufacturers will simply replace it with alternatives. For example, in China, where Android phones are popular but Google services are largely inaccessible (due to the government censorship rather than anything that is Google's fault, but the situation is sufficiently similar to Google losing its edge), Android phones come with Baidu as their default search engine. There was even a phone released on Verizon that had Bing as its default search engine (Microsoft probably paid Verizon a ton of money for that).",1368392074

5695759,comment,5694893,5694893,4,0,philwelch,,,"The reason retirement doesn't work the same way as a bicycle shop is because the incentives can get badly misaligned. With a bicycle shop, the better you are at fixing bicycles, the more money you make, at least to a good-enough order of approximation. Taking your customer's money just isn't possible unless you give them back a working bicycle. But retirement--especially ""defined contribution"" retirement--has a much weaker requirement. You give money to a mutual fund, and then who knows what'll happen? The mutual fund takes their fee off the top regardless. You let the company that's servicing your 401k or IRA pick funds for you and they'll just pick some plausible combination of their own funds. At least with pensions they have to maximize their return to have any hope of profiting.<p>Probably the closest analogy to retirement is auto repair and maintenance. You go in for an oil change and you get back a hundred-something-point inspection where they want to do a thousand dollars worth of work on your car. If you don't know anything about cars, there's no way to tell whether they're ripping you off. With retirement it's even worse, because you started off by giving them the money without any guarantee of how much money makes its way back to you. And the only solution is to actually know something about investing, which was pretty much what you were paying these companies for in the first place.",1368391552

In fact, its even worse than that. The original designs for networking, going back to Ted Nelson, kept track of everything everybody was pointing at so that you would know who was pointing at your website. In a way Facebook is just recovering information that was deliberately lost because of the fetish for being anonymous. Thats also true of Google.<p>Wow, this is so wrong I am annoyed by it. The Internet is not ""anonymous"" (it really isn't, for the most part) because someone designed it that way. You can read the design rules set out by DARPA and see that they were concerned about infrastructure above all else [1]. The fundamental goal was the multiplexing of many different networks. The top three secondary goals were:<p>1. Network resilience\n2. Multiple communication types\n3.

My main workstation basically runs Chrome, Emacs, and some xterms.  On my Pixel, I can just use Secure Shell to ssh to my tmux session and be working on exactly what I was using on my desktop.  (Port forwarding works too, if you're developing a web app or something.)  It's like being at my desktop except the keyboard and ergonomics aren't as good.<p>If I need to edit a screencast or image, two things I've never done for work ever in my life, I can just use Chrome Remote Desktop to log into my workstation.  (I have a friend who logs in to his Windows machine at home using Chrome Remote Desktop and plays Final Fantasy.  It's that usable!)<p>For what it's worth, I never really used a laptop until I got my Chromebook Pixel, because it was so painful to keep it up to date and my configuration sync'd.  My Thinkpad X220 has been sitting dead on my windowsill for about a year.  With ChromeOS, I don't have to deal with that anymore; I can just open up my computer and use it.  And it's that usability that makes it worthwhile to me.

One thing that made me apprehensive about switching from a Linux laptop to a Chromebook was that I wouldn't be able to use all the features of my portable HF SDR ham radio (an Elecraft KX3) while traveling with only my laptop.  But, fixing this is just a simple matter of programming -- you can write a Chrome app that controls a USB device, and you can read incoming audio.  (Meaning that you can tune the radio and read the I/Q signal via the soundcard.  The only snag is that the Chromebook Pixel has only one channel of input, and you need two to reassemble the nearby radio signals.  But a USB dongle can fix that problem.)

Kodak didn't get blindsided by the advent of digital, in fact they were the first ones there (literally the first commercial DSLR was a Kodak).<p>Their main problem appeared to be both technological and competitive. In the <i>very</i> early stages of digital SLRs Kodak provided sensors to <i>all</i> of the big players, establishing themselves as the go-to OEM for sensor tech.<p>And then Canon decided to not put the most important component of their camera in someone else's hands, and folded sensor tech into their own company as a core component. This was also the age where Canon was eating Nikon for lunch through superior design and marketing, so Kodak lost not only a large customer, but their remaining ones were being pummeled in the market.<p>Nikon followed soon afterward, though in the long run they were unable to sustain their own semiconductor R&D and now run primarily Sony sensors.<p>Kodak went from the go-to OEM for sensor technology to nibbling at the extremely niche sector of scientific equipment photo sensors and rich-surgeon-toy cameras like the Leica M9. It's a sad tale really, and while I'm sure Kodak had many opportunities to avoid their demise, the whole story isn't <i>quite</i> a textbook tale of ridiculously bad management.<p>Nowadays there are few companies actually building digital sensors. Canon is the big one, Sony is the next big one (which also power Panasonic, Olympus, Nikon, Pentax, and Sony's own cameras). Samsung is the straggler - their OEM business has gone kaput in recent years, but they are still building sensors for their own cameras (which are largely failing in the market). Fuji is the standout in the pack, still making their own sensors despite being comparatively a tiny fish in the pond.",1368389396

This has nothing to do with Schleswig-Holstein.<p>The only interesting question is whether you as a German company or individual can be held responsible if you include facebook's like button on your website. Thilo Weichert says yes, but we'll have to see how the first judges will decide on this matter. If he is right then this is true for whole Germany.",1313773194

I've noticed that the personality style of ""algorithm obsessed, Knuth worshiping, all about optimization, hardcore coder"" doesn't have a lot in common with ""creative, new software, good UI, unique application builder"" personality. While its important to have some of the former under your belt, its the latter that gets shit done and makes things. I consider myself a maker, not a coder or a computer scientist. I'm getting a little sick of the attitude that you need to be this hotshot coder to be into software. Its just this geek macho poseur mentality that's harmful.  A mediocre coder with a few good ideas is all it takes.  I'd rather see a slow python app or a simple web app that's unique than some super-fast C or low-level me-too implementation.<p>I feel this dichotomy is typical of geeks. My poor metaphor is we learn the notes, scales, and do our practices, but at the end of the day we're supposed to be writing songs, not waxing philosophic on music theory or who makes the best pianos.  Geeks are just too prone to being ""technically correct, the best kind of correct!"" and those of us who want to create unique things really need to think more like artists than engineers half the time. Oh well, back to our typical barrage of ""Why PHP sucks"" and ""real coders walk like this..."" articles",1313772996

That goes for any white collar profession, like say lawyering.  See that unrich lawyer, what's wrong with him?  Maybe he's not good at lawyering, but is good at writing about lawyering or playing a lawyer on a social network, which describes quite a few SEO ""experts.""  Maybe he's good at lawyering but not good at extracting value from it.  Maybe he works in a sector where money does not naturally concentrate, like public interest law.  Maybe he doesn't really care for money.  Maybe he's rich and doesn't feel like talking about it.  Maybe he's playing a different game or one with different time horizons.<p>As to whether you can make a full-time living doing SEO: yes.  People do.

The theorem asserts that a continuous function on a compact set (for our purposes closed and bounded set) has a maximum (and a minimum). In this case the the closed and bounded set is the sphere of all possible orientations for solar panels. The theorem is mentioned in most introductory calculus courses, but the proof is definitely not 'trivial'.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theorem</a>",1313771937

The devices really are ONLY for reading.  I spend my entire day in front of a full-blown computer, so when I have a break I don't want another full-blown computer in front of me.  I want a book or a reading device.  This is the same reason why I don't own a smartphone.  I think I'm in the minority of geeks, but in the majority of regular people when I say this.

This is sometimes accomplished by adding features that give the company access to new markets for its products (selling a smartphone after gaining experience with portable music players).<p>Secondly, on an individual basis, the desire for excellence always comes from within, and results from an inward ethical focus.

In RDR, you progressively receive more weapons, mounts, and (to some degree) abilities as the game progresses. I think emergent gameplay pulls some players in, but I'm not sure it explains the statistics provided by the article.""</i><p>To your point, there's actually a very good argument to be made that emergent gameplay (or the possibility thereof) <i>decreases</i> the desire to finish the game. It increases replayability, and total time played, but it creates incentives to ""mess around"" within the game and not to play it in a linear fashion.<p>My overall thesis is that games seem to have shifted away from linearity on aggregate, to the point where ""story mode"" is now a value-add. Single-player, linear, traditional gameplay is the side option that multiplayer or sandbox used to be in the early days of console gaming. Fewer people are finishing games in the traditional sense, because fewer games are being published that are designed to be finished. [That design choice may not be intentional, as evidenced by the exhorbitant production values and costs being sunk by developers and publishers into ""story mode"" voice acting, cinematics, art direction, and so forth.]",1313770110

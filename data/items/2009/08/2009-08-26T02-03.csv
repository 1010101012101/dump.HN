It's probably better than 95% of small businesses out there.

Loads of young people with good ideas but needing funding, advice and connections<p>2. $20,000 is enough to make a worthwhile full-length film nowadays (have you seen Primer? It cost $7,000.)<p>3.

A single well-connected individual (the pg of film) could provide enough connections to give the films the maximum chance of being shown at festivals etc and eventually picked up for distribution. Alternatively, even the ones that weren't picked up for distribution could be marketed on DVD, and the fact that they were made as part of the ""YC-of-film"" program would attract at least some interest for them.<p>Foreseeable problems: the existing studios and unions might have a problem with it.

That they point out who he is adds to this, since not only is he only invited because of his job title, but the newspaper is also using the title to add weight and authority.  If the employees of a company offend you the best and really only way to influence them is to stop giving that company your money.<p>Really, as a practical matter, no CEO of any company should be out there publicly talking about their personal political views.

Many non-techie businesses don't really have that ""alpha"" stage until there's a lot more money involved, making 3 months and $10,000 a poor trade for equity from the founder's perspective.<p>Additionally, tech startups tend to have a serious valuation ramp-up and multiple investment rounds that many other industries don't.

And there is no limit to human ingenuity in inventing new technology to economically produce those resources. Any nation, company, or individual that bets on 'peak oil' is doing so on an ideological basis and is going to loose big. Having people who have never set foot on a drill rig babbling on about 'peak oil' is tantamount to someone who doesn't understand computing betting against Moore's Law.<p>For example: The combination of swell packers for multi-stage fracture stimulation of multi-lateral wells in tight oil and shale gas resource plays, coupled with multi-azimuth 3D seismic for detecting naturally occurring fracture networks,and microseismic for frac job design has completely revolutionized the US hydrocarbons business in the past few years. These are new technologies applied to produce oil and gas resources that used to be considered uneconomic.<p>Every now and then you hear some talking head warning about how Moore's Law is about to stop scaling. Meanwhile, Intel keeps adding new process technologies to their roadmap. Does the semiconductor industry have the technology in 2009 to build some of these fab's? No. Will the industry invent the technology to build that fab? Yes. It's the same thing with hydrocarbons.<p>BTW, a lot of the advances in semiconductor process technology are being used to discover new reserves of hydrocarbons. For example, one of the leading applications of NVIDIA's gp-gpu technology is for 3D-Seismic oil and gas exploration.",1251252685

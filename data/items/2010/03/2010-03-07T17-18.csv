Fixed price ads (like you see on TechCrunch or TheDeck) are generally based on a CPM rate.<p>Pay per click ads aren't generally worth enough money to sustain sites that produce content.  Aggregators, search engines, social networks, etc, have a much, much lower cost per pageview, and can do pretty well.  On Ars, we'd need to average about 50,000 pageviews per normal post to pay the writer for it with something like Google AdSense.  And that's assuming that the campaigns AdSense picks are pretty good.<p>There <i>are</i> whitepaper links and stuff you can get much better CPC rates for, but those generally only work if you're sneaky about them and embed them in content, or make them look like site resources.",1267984795

1173673,comment,1173226,1173226,0,0,scott_s,,,"Latex is better than its competitors (Word, OpenOffice), but it has its problems. Many of the environments are fragile and not composable. Last night, I was trying to embed a list inside a table.<p>I had this, and the problem was that the longer item does not wordwrap:<p><pre><code>  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Title A} & thing 1 \\
    & thing 2, but it's much longer than the other items \\
    & thing 3  \\
  \hline
  \textbf{Title B} & thing 1 \\
    & thing 2, but it's much longer than the other items \\
    & thing 3 \\
  \hline
  \textbf{Title C} & thing 1 \\
    & thing 2, but it's much longer than the other items \\
    & thing 3 \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
</code></pre>
The items on the right are not a list. However, you can not embed an <i>itemize</i> environment in a tabular environment. Further, this table does no word wrapping. I wanted an itemized, bulleted list on the right, so 30 minutes of Googling and experimenting later, I have a solution using the tabularx package:<p><pre><code>  \begin{tabularx}{0.9\linewidth}{|l|X|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Title A} & \begin{itemize}
    \item thing 1
    \item thing 2, but it's much longer than the other items
    \item thing 3
  \end{itemize} \\
  \hline
  \textbf{Title B} & \begin{itemize}
    \item thing 1
    \item thing 2, but it's much longer than the other items
    \item thing 3
  \end{itemize} \\
  \hline
  \textbf{Title C} & \begin{itemize}
    \item thing 1
    \item thing 2, but it's much longer than the other items
    \item thing 3
  \end{itemize} \\
  \hline
  \end{tabularx}
</code></pre>
This does as advertised. I get a word wrapped, bulleted list on the right. It's also fugly. The spacing of the list is atrocious. It's not fit for a professional publication. Eventually, I end up rolling my own bulleted list:<p><pre><code>  \begin{tabularx}{0.9\linewidth}{|l|X|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Title A} & 
    $\bullet$ thing 1 \newline
    $\bullet$ thing 2, but it's much longer than the other items \newline
    $\bullet$ thing 3  \newline
  \hline
  \textbf{Title B} & 
    $\bullet$ thing 1 \newline
    $\bullet$ thing 2, but it's much longer than the other items \newline
    $\bullet$ thing 3 \newline
  \hline
  \textbf{Title C} &
    $\bullet$ thing 1 \newline
    $\bullet$ thing 2, but it's much longer than the other itmes \newline
    $\bullet$ thing 3 \newline
  \hline
  \end{tabularx}
</code></pre>
Finally, this looks okay. But the road it took to get here is ridiculous, and the solution I came up with is silly. (Also note that I had to use \newline, because the end paragraph maker, \\, would screw up the table.)<p>In the end, I like Latex. It is, as I said, better than the alternatives. When what you want to do fits exactly into what's provided, it's fine. But when you hit edge cases, abstractions leak and you can sink hours into fixing things. I would love there to be a version of Latex that was not fragile like this.",1267983744
1173672,comment,1173619,1173619,0,0,tptacek,,,"This question comes up all the time here. There's a very simple answer: Yes. If equity is a significant part of your compensation, you need to be informed of how to value it.<p>Here are all the caveats and wrinkles I can think of:<p>* Ownership percentages are deceptive. If you're an employee (meaning: you start with a steady salary), 1% is a big number. With 19 employees preceding you, you're probably not getting 1%. After funding, the founders may be only high single digits themselves.<p>* 90% of 0 is 0. You need to be asking questions about how equity might become worth something. This isn't as hard a conversation as you may think it is. Startups often sell for rule-of-thumb multiples of revenue. Ask: two years from now, what's the top line revenue of the company going to be? Will the market value the company at 2x that revenue (a consulting company multiple), 4x (a product company), or 8x (a product in a red-hot market)? Take all the numbers you get and work back what the company is saying you might make if the company gets bought, and then scale it by the likelihood that any private company gets bought favorably. Otherwise, all the ""percentage"" you get is is a point score for your ego.<p>* (<i>most importantly</i>) Even if you know what the shares are worth today, you don't in fact know anything about what they're worth by the time they become liquid. That's because every single financing event in the company will reallocate ownership. Every round of funding is going to impact them. In extreme but not (unfortunately) rare cases, your shares can be worth nothing even in a tens-of-millions-of-dollars acquisition --- this goes double if you leave the company before the liquidity event. A company with a stock plan and 20 employees has spent a lot of money on legal to ensure that you have no rights.<p>I just got back from a huge industry convention in San Francisco, and after talking to a lot of friends there, I've come to this conclusion: tech people are <i>unbelievably</i> awful negotiators. Let me make a suggestion. Do what you'd do if you were buying a car. Negotiate the value of the transaction in an objective currency: dollars. Then, when the company tries to ""finance"" the deal in shares, you at least know the dollar value <i>they're</i> trying to assign to the shares.",1267983702

It usually leads to shots taken at a tougher angle, or with more arc, that ultimately are going to be less successful, on average.<p>Unfortunately this impact would be very hard to accurately quantify.  You could perhaps compare a player or teams average success of a given shot (especially near the basket) against the success of a given shot with the shot blocker on the court.  There may not be enough data to do this, and unfortunately this still doesn't accurate gauge the plays when the shot blocker truely affected the shot (if a layup was taken and he was 15 feet away, he most likely had little to no impact on the shooter's decision making (note he still could have some small impact, because players do take more notice of who is around them when taking a shot when a known shotblocker is on the floor.

It does. Look at the average TV channel or print magazine for evidence.<p><i>I’ve heard Google pass as little as one twelfth onto the publisher in some cases</i><p>While I'm not sure about Google, I do know that most display advertising networks pay their publishers around 30% - 50% of the gross income.<p><i>But seriously, advertising is a broken method of paying for stuff.  If we could unobtrusively pay for content on the Internet, I’m sure enough people would do so to more than cover costs of production.</i><p>While I agree that there is probably a decent community of people that would probably pay for content online, I'm not convinced that this would be true for most people. Sites that offer a subscription to get rid of the ads, usually have <i>very</i> few subscribers. People simply like free stuff, and don't like to pay for content. Now this could indeed be due to the payment model, I'm not sure; maybe something facebook-connect-like for paid content would work, but I'm still not convinced that a large enough base of people would actually pay the same money as they're generating in advertising value, to make this work.<p>Let's take a few very large sites, and imagine what would happen if they went to a payment supported revenue model, instead of advertising supported. Let's say, Google or CNN. What would happen if they started putting up a paywall? Would people really start paying for those services, or would they simply move to a competing site, which is ad-supported and for free?

Yellowpages), so much that when you come to them offering online advertising for ridiculously low prices ($50-100/mo.) they just go for it most of the time. A Yellowpages ad can cost $500-1500/mo. for a tiny little placement.<p>My friend essentially built a network of niche sites for his city, so {cityname}furniture.com, {cityname}dentists, {cityname}antiques etc. The sites were just simple directories with some content, a contact/request a quote form and a list of local businesses. He'd gather a list of businesses and contact them all explaining the site and how it would cost them $50/mo. for a listing, it would help their search rankings, bring traffic, generate leads and new business, etc.<p>He said his best money was actually made off dentists and he had to break the site up into {neighbourhood}dentists because there were so many in the city interested. A typical site would feature 3-4 banner ads that cost $100/mo. (little 125x125 squares for each dental firm), and then around 10 or so $50/mo. business listings (custom page, images of office, testimonials, etc).<p>It's fair to say a single site would net him $800/mo - of course this varies on the type of business being targeted, but there are so many kinds of businesses to target that you won't be able to capture every market in the city.<p>On top of things, he made money generating leads for the businesses. For the dentist example, he had a ""request a quote"" form that basically got people to explain what they wanted done, budget, their contact info, etc. He sold leads for ~$20 each (would make the different dentists bid on them). This is nothing for most places as a lead can turn into $1000 worth of business in the first appointment, and thousands more over the years as that patient returns.<p>If you can create a value added service locally and get people onboard for next to nothing (as they see it, $50 is nothing), then you have a real opportunity to make some cash. Take this to the next level and start managing their PPC campaigns and managing ad deals and you have yourself a healthy local market - most of which you can find someone cheap to handle (around the cost of a secretary, anyone with a bit of technical know-how will do).<p>Bringing all this stuff up again kind of makes me want to go back into it.. hmm. weekend project perhaps?",1267982048

Consider implementing some network protocol.

You could make this a static function and pass all the arguments in, correctly, each time and if you only need a single value back that works.

Most scientists definitely believe there is a single absolute unshifting reality below it all and they are outlining it.<p>I find that actually quite sad. From a man who actually died for his ""scientific"" convictions (<a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#On_the_Infinite_Universe_and_Worlds_.281584.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#On_the_Infinite_...</a>):<p>> It is then unnecessary to investigate whether there be beyond the heaven Space, Void or Time. For there is a single general space, a single vast immensity which we may freely call Void; in it are innumerable globes like this one on which we live and grow. This space we declare to be infinite, since neither reason, convenience, possibility, sense-perception nor nature assign to it a limit. In it are an infinity of worlds of the same kind as our own.<p>I think we can easily extrapolate an ""infinity of worlds"" to an ""infinity of Universes/realities"", or at least we can think about extrapolating, that's what philosophy was the first to do. Actually, I think Giordano Bruno would be seen as a lunatic by most of today's scientists, which I find it even more sad.",1340009967

4125582,comment,4125198,4125452,37,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Let's take an example, since they seem to work best: vaccines.<p>Vaccines protect you from the risk of contracting particular diseases, some of which are crippling, lethal, or incurable.  Plus, most are extremely effective: once you take your shots, you are effectively immune. That's good.<p>There is a downside however.  Sometimes, vaccines have side effects.  Most side effects are quite benign, but if you're unlucky enough, they can be crippling, lethal, or incurable.  That's bad.<p>From a medical point of view, vaccines are a net good (let's leave aside logistic considerations, or the effort required to go to the doctor).  When you look at the stats, you stand a much better chance at life and health if you take the shot.  Even for relatively minor illnesses like the flu.<p>Now, let's say someone post a heartbreaking comment about how her 9 year old daughter died of a vaccine shot, with all the gory details about the suffering, how she couldn't participate in her school's festival, the size of the coffin I'm quite sure there <i>are</i> stories of the kind.  Given the sheer amount of readers here, maybe one of you will more or less directly relate to that.  My apologies to those who do.<p>Nevertheless, what makes a good story doesn't necessarily make good evidence.  When you know of reliable statistics, and you read a contrarian anecdote, you should shift your belief in the direction of the anecdote by a precise amount, which is almost always tiny.  What your brain will actually do behind you back however, is shifting your belief by a <i>significant</i> amount, often crossing the ""reasonable doubt"" line.  That's not rational, but that's what will happen.  Nameless statistics feel abstract, remote.  An anecdote on the other hand feels concrete, real, close.  Worse, you can spend far more time reading about the salient anecdotes than learning about the end results of reliable, but boring, scientific studies.<p>Another example: you don't win the lottery.  Period.  You don't know of any close family of friend that ever did.  But maybe one of you readers do.  Maybe that one could comment and say ""Hey, but my cousin <i>did</i> win the lottery!"".  Would that prove me wrong?  Not at all.  It's just that when the sample size is huge enough, even the tiniest chance can actualize.",1340009224

I left philosophy because after all my reading, note-taking, class-discussioning, and debate tournamenting, I never felt like I'd made any progress, and that mattered to me personally. At the end of the day, the questions that were hard to answer were still unsolved, and the gray ethical areas were still gray. This is why I don't do philosophy, and I why I found the science bug.<p>I get your point, but for all intents and purposes that's one of the things that makes philosophy great, i.e. the fact that Heraclitus's sayings are as actual today as they were 2,500 years ago. You'll also have to agree that deciding once and for all (or ""proving"" by scientific means) what makes as taking ""moral"" decisions, or if ""morals"" even exist at all, or what makes us not kill each other once we've stopped believing in gods etc.,  is better left ""unresolved"", because this ""philosophical quest"" is what makes us humans.",1340008978

4125563,comment,4124183,4125001,6,0,masklinn,,,"> That's not an operator, that's a lambda. The end result is the same, but semantically it's very different.<p>It's not, actually. In most functional languages  including F#  operators are just a special case of functions. Haskell will let you both use operators as (prefix) functions (via sections):<p><pre><code>    Prelude> (/) 42 2
    21.0
</code></pre>
or use functions as (infix, binary) operators:<p><pre><code>    Prelude> even `filter` [0..20]
    [0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
</code></pre>
and operators are defined exactly the same way you'd define functions:<p><pre><code>    Prelude> let (><) a b = a * b in 3 >< 4
    12
</code></pre>
although you can define them infix if you prefer:<p><pre><code>    Prelude> let a >< b = a * b in 3 >< 4
    12
</code></pre>
then again, you can also define functions using infix syntax:<p><pre><code>    Prelude> let a `add` b = a + b in add 3 4
    7
</code></pre>
You can also partially apply operators (again, via sections):<p><pre><code>    Prelude> :t (1 +)
    (1 +) :: Num a => a -> a
</code></pre>
in roughly the same way you'd partially apply functions:<p><pre><code>    Prelude> :t map (+ 1)
    map (+ 1) :: Num b => [b] -> [b]
</code></pre>
> Passing around an operator means you don't need to know the types involved<p>Uh? You need to know them in exactly the same way you do for functions.<p>> you can have a function that operates on any two values and applies an operator to them.<p>No, you most definitely can't, both operators and functions are typed. They work <i>the exact same way</i> but for the syntactic difference that operators are infix and may have precedence junk on top. But that's parsing, aside from that, a functional language will treat functions and operators the same way (outside of the odd builtin)",1340008561

The same companies that you're criticizing are actually subcontracted by Bayer, etc. to produce their products so they can be sold in the developing world. If Indian did not produce these medicines, they would not be available to the poor at all. So at least they're saving lives that the developed world wasn't interested in saving.<p>Secondly: historically, Indian pharma growth was stunted due to old British laws. Once the industry was unshackled, it grew at a breathtaking rate, mostly by building generic variants of well-known drugs. This has allowed the Indian pharma industry to develop enough local expertise about formulation, manufacturing and distribution. Now they're moving up the food chain by patenting new drugs. Ranbaxy Labs, for example, is busy filing patents[1].<p>You can't expect the domestic industry to just sprout up organically. The Indian government never spent much money on R&D, so there wasn't much local drug research. But now that they're under the same patent regime, the Indian industries will have to figure out a way to survive.<p>Having said all this: please don't assume that Western drug companies' hands are clean. They are busy trawling the jungles of Amazon (among other places) to find new compounds, often taking knowledge from local shamans, etc. without any respect for their ""IP"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.financialexpress.com/news/ranbaxy-tops-third-world-patents-list/122766/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.financialexpress.com/news/ranbaxy-tops-third-worl...</a>",1340007134

But it is damageable to ignore some fundamentals, from Pythagoras to Descartes (regarding science).<p>As I think about it, it comes to me that whether philosophy is or isn't necessary isn't relevant.
Empirical necessity doesn't sums up human aspirations, and music or poetry play in the same field.

In some areas with less funding, it's perfectly normal for professors to have their students TA most of the time; but in most science departments, the prof's expected to pay a substantial proportion of their students from grant money, and it'll look bad if a prof is always ""dumping students on the department"" by funding them through TAships.<p>And if you're expected to pay your students, it takes a lot of money! One student, including tuition, stipend, and departmental overhead, costs around $50k, so if your lab is 5 students, you have to bring in $250k a year just to support your grad students. And if you start dipping below about $150k, so are supporting fewer than half your students, people will start grumbling, and it'll look bad for your tenure case.

1377010,comment,1376164,1376362,0,0,1369ic,,,"Well, somebody has to go the other way. If you haven't looked at Slackware lately, give it a shot.  The advances in the kernel and KDE and XFCE make it a really nice environment now.  Yes, it still has an ncurses installer, and yes, it still boots (at least the first time) to a command prompt.  But the installer really is easy, and it takes changing one number in one file to boot to a log-in screen.<p>Once you're in your desktop environment, the biggest difference you'll see is that Slackware is more responsive and more stable.  KDE 4.4 in particular has the non-technical user covered.  XFCE is easy too, but you might want to add some packages (which Robby Workman always seems to compile and have available on his site).  Oh, and you should install WICD from the extra folder on the DVD if you use wireless.<p>Slackware also has slackpkg in by default now.  You have to do it at the command line, but it updates the official packages with two simple commands.<p>Updating to a new release is still not as easy as a lot of other distros, but that's one of the bullets that most probably should bite and reinstall from scratch once a year or so.  And if you don't want to I'm sure a Slackware install will continue working at least as long as the Ubuntu LTS version.<p>The thing is, Slackware still gives you vanilla packages, but the advances throughout the system have made vanilla a whole lot richer.",1274783598

Admittedly, I lived in midtown in Atlanta, and mostly went to other places that have good subway service: Decatur, downtown, Buckhead, the airport, etc. To get to other places, the buses are kind of lame, but I wouldn't say they're any more lame than Muni's terrible buses.

1376989,comment,1376846,1376846,0,0,jacquesm,,,"No.<p>You can't inject data in to a system using the power connector unless it is explicitly designed to do so because the first barrier you hit is the conditioning circuitry that will stabilize the voltage and will strip any data that you are trying to super-impose on top of the supply line in to the system. In other words you'd have to make a non-trivial modification to the iphone first. I'm using the words 'powerline' here in a bit of a weird way, because normally when you talk about powerline transmission you mean the household circuitry, not the lower voltage line in to the device, but strictly speaking that is also a 'power line'. More accurate would be the charging voltage or supply voltage.<p>And even if you got past that it would still be pretty much impossible to get a reliable effect from manipulating the input voltage to the various chips at a high rate, most likely if you managed to bypass the filtering circuitry all you'd manage to do by the time the voltage swing on the power line would be high enough would be to either damage or crash the phone.<p>'Real' powerline modems work by having a capacitive or inductive coupling with the powerline to retrieve the superimposed signal that was placed on the wire with a similar circuit, and will use a separate channel to transfer this information to some other device. You could integrate all that in to a single box but it would make it much harder to get approval for a device (because it would be connected to the mains voltage directly).<p>So if a device is not explicitly designed with this in mind you can't do it without modification.",1274782845

I certainly like it more than some typical tag-lines but I understand it might be bad idea to general public. Your feedback about this is certainly appreciated.<p>2. Huh. I tried to make a clear/minimal page, but I guess I didn't succeed that well. Do you have anything specific that is confusing. About screenshot, I like the (hopefully) ""effective"" looks of it in same way I like looks of gmail. I will further work on this. Thanks for bringing it out.<p>3. mini as in minimal :).

These are two opposite extremes - the social mind and technical one. ^_^<p>btw, dividing of the tasks and responsibility is a good thing in general, and that is how (and why) YC works - they're searching for an appropriate state of the mind and help them to overcome people/business related difficulties..

The session key is then used to key the MAC and bulk cipher.<p>If an attacker records the traffic, then factors or steals the public key, they can decrypt the session key and read the traffic.<p>With ephemeral Diffie-Hellman, a random DH public value is generated for each connection and the server signs it with its public key. Each side then performs key agreement to generate the session key. Now, an attacker can solve the discreet logarithm and decrypt the traffic, but they have to break each connection separately.<p>The trick in the future is to perform Diffie-Hellman much faster (answer: write tuned code to work in an elliptic curve group) and then to perform EDH without the latency hit (longer term).",1278248372

Not that I really want to be picking nits over all this and getting hyperanalytical over one line from fleitz's inspiring story, but...<p>You know why petercooper disregarded the ""great, funny, vibrant, intelligent"" part? Because those are qualities fleitz values in his new partner that are <i>inherent to her</i>. But the qualities of being ""much thinner and younger"" than some other woman are not. Those are the sort of comparisons you make when you view women as trophies, which, I hope we can all agree, is pretty douchebaggey.<p>Now I don't actually think fleitz is a women-as-trophies sort of guy.

No mechanism has been proposed.]</i><p>Dr Jason Halford ... said: ""What the Japanese research shows is that individual differences in eating behaviour underlie over-consumption of food and are linked to obesity."" <i>[No, it showed there is a statistical link.

No hint of references given, so we can't find out for ourselves.]</i><p>... there was no evidence yet that trying to slow down mealtimes for children would have an impact on future obesity rates. <i>[So the one piece of experimental procedure that might really confirm this either hasn't been done, or doesn't support the conclusion.]</i><p>================================<p>Having said all that, when I lost weight recently I worked hard on eating more slowly, and I do feel that it helped me feel less hungry on my 1600 kCal/day ""diet"".

1485566,comment,1485184,1485184,0,0,_Lemon_,,,"Generally a good experience, needs adding to. Here's some feedback/thoughts:<p>1) The text boxes on the sign up page are massive and take up the whole line (same with the login).
2) Sign up process isn't that ""smooth"", how about an automatic log in instead of asking me to check my inbox? (I have my e-mail open and it made me sigh...)
3) The sign up e-mail has a massive wall of text on how to use the application. While it's good explaining, I feel that in the e-mail is the wrong place. Making it a webpage will allow you to more comfortably use bullet points and numbers and just easier to digest/find. Or perhaps an interactive thing and point to page elements?
4) You put a $ sign in amount field and I took this as an opportunity to change to £ which didn't work as expected. What about putting it as ""Amount ($)"" or removing it entirely.
5) Sensible default of ""1"" on the recurring once enabled?
6) Data entry is a problem.
7) Missed setting a transaction to ""recurring every"" and had to delete and re-add to set it.
8) Bug! Added a recurring transaction as 15 but set the type to expense, went to edit it and change it back to income. This only changed the first transaction and further recurring transactions were left unchanged. Clicking on the refresh button and it's now still showing all the items as expenses again.
9) You could drop the ""type"" entirely and get the user to enter -15 for expense and just 15 for an income!
10) Editing the recurring transactions and I hit edit and I don't realise the form above me has changed -- perhaps some sort of visual cue? Or perhaps, click the fields and they become editable?
11) No back button (browser's button uses stale data) to the page I was on before. Resorted to clicking the ""Dashboard"".
12) Bug! Still entering data, missed the ""Amount"" field and it has reset my type to ""Expense"". Strange that it doesn't reset the type when I miss ""recurring every"" value.<p>Sweet! I'm finished! Problem: I would quite like to have more financial projections but currently the problem is entering the data; you'd need ways to easily add it (e.g. various import functions or an API. The way I see things:<p>cost of adding data + cost of the app (what you would charge) < cost of doing this myself (e.g. investing time to graph the projections using my own database (saving on data entry time!))<p>Grouping would also be a good feature to have e.g. I would want to project transactions for separate things.<p>Controlling how far in the future I can see the forecase, although I realise this is probably just a proof of concept app.",1278246146

Looking at my own network, which includes a variety of .net, php, ruby, python and java folks, the overwhelming number of people involved in bootstrapping, freelancing or startup endeavours are not using .NET.<p>Again, I point to websitespark, bizspark, and MS' own efforts in helping PHP operate smoothly on their own platform.  10 years ago PHP was laughed at by most MS people I know.  Today, it still is by many of the same people, but Microsoft as a company must see enough demand for it that they spend time with some of the PHP development team making sure that PHP runs smoothly on Windows.  MS now provides a one-click installer for PHP on top of that.<p>Yes, certainly, all this is simply anecdotal, and I've absolutely no way of knowing for certain how many 'startups' use .net vs not using it.  When people still refer to facebook as a 'startup' perhaps the term has lost all meaning whatsoever, and anyone who's opened a company in the past 15 years is now running a 'startup'.  But again, I fall back to my own experiences in and around my network.  People * I know* using .NET are generally doing so in larger corporate environments (where it's much easier to afford all the tooling which makes .NET fun/easy to develop with)  People <i>I know</i> in smaller orgs, smallbiz startup mode, or freelancing are generally <i>not</i> using .NET, primarily because of price.<p>The pricing is part of the motivation behind websitespark and bizspark programs of the past couple years.  If MS themselves weren't seeing a defection in the smallbiz/startup scene away from the MS platform, I doubt we'd have seen these programs come in to existence in the first place.  We certainly didn't see them 12 years ago.<p>This belief was also largely reinforced by casual 'in the hallway' conversations with attendees at the recent CodeStock event in Knoxville.  While language-agnostic in theory, it's still largely an MS-oriented event, based on both attendees' background and session topics around 50% of the topics were .net-oriented)",1278244833

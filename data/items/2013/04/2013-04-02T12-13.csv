Tom's running his own email server, which is a huge chunk of privacy right there.<p>Distributing your identity across multiple companies means, at the very least, they've got to do more work to create a unified profile of you.  One of my major beefs against Google, and a reason why I separate my own use of the company's products among different (or no) identities and browsers is that its usage profile is drawn across such a wide range of products.  Google knows my search, my social, my video viewing, my maps usage, my email reading habits, and more.  That's ... fine until the regime changes ... or gets pissed off at me.<p>I've started thinking of ways in which the FreedomBox (plug-based cheap computers running Debian and largely self-configuring software tools) could take the place of most of the present generation of cloud computing.  The compute power and raw storage are effectively trivial requirements to meet.  Distributed storage for redundancy slightly harder, but still very doable.  The real key is bringing down the configuration and management elements to the level that Joe and Jane Average Internet User can just plug and play.  And I suspect it's not too far off.  A few years, but not much more.<p>Whether or not people will buy into it is another matter, but as with Linux, if enough do, it won't matter, and even if this means that small hosted services exist, the idea of separating out and federalizing people's data would be an advantage over the present regime.",1364907314

But the evidence from Japan, a slowly, albeit steadily, deflating advanced economy is compelling.<p>From January 1995 to January 2010, Japan's CPI (2005=100) has fallen from 100.8797 to 99.5851, or or -0.08% per year. In that time, real wages grew 0.23% [1]. Real GDP/capita at 0.61%. Hell, from 2010 to 2013 their CPI has fallen at 0.27% annually, but the hit has been mixed. Note that the Japanese monetary base (M2) has expanded at 2.5% annually from 1995 to 2010, so this is a demand-driven deflation, consistent with Morana. But the deflation we base our analysis on, the Great Depression, was similarly spurred by demand.<p>Similarly, Germany, through the Hartz reforms, engineered a wage deflation at the beginning of this century. Helping power the American recovery is wage deflation. The hope is austerity, structural re-alignment through deflation,  will similarly fix peripheral Europe's bloated labour costs.<p>Yes, it appears people will take falling wages if forced. All this said, I do not believe a deflating national currency is the right model for Bitcoin.

Why? Is deflation really that bad when it comes from productivity?  We know deflation due to massive decrease in money supply or velocity is bad, but what is wrong with slow, steady deflation from productivity?<p>2) With 2-3% steady deflation, won't interest rates adjust? People will lend their money out to earn a better risk adjusted rate than deflation.  There isn't some magical number or percentage where people will start or stop lending. It's more like behavioral economics where people have several choices at different risk profiles.<p>3) The biggest proponent for an inflationary system is the banking system and economists who are funded/trained/selected by the banking system. This casts a lot of doubt on 'inflation is bad for lenders' statement.  In a deflationary system, productivity gains go to the consumers (via lower prices).  In an inflationary system, productivity gains go to capital owners (via debt and higher prices).<p>The US experienced very strong but volatile economic growth under a capitalistic fixed currency system (gold standard) that had periods of deflation and inflation in the 19th century.

I am passing my prime (in the scale of software developers), approaching middle age.  Software development is something I love and have loved since I was a kid.  However, I've never had a natural talent for it; I would never use the term ""ninja"" when describing myself (partly because I don't have the skill and partly because I'm too old to use ridiculous terms like that).<p>It's hard work to gain the understanding that others around me easily have, but I don't and won't stop trying.  It's been a journey of education and the education is something I've quite enjoyed.  The group in which I work was guided towards learning better design principles and while I did not stand out in the group, I came away with a better understanding and better ability.  The group has since gone in a different direction, thus removing my motivation for remaining within it -- the pursuit of mastery (other than the obvious requisite paycheck).<p>Being 40ish, my ""forming"" years are behind me, so I'm not one to be ""shaped"" in the image of another.  I've been lucky enough to have fallen into jobs or have ""known someone"" for most of my professional track.  But now I'm wanting to leave a stable job that pays adequately with the goal of finding a position that provides more job and life satisfaction.  So I am wondering...is there a job market for a middle-aged developer who isn't among the best, but brings a desire to learn; a constant effort to become better and gain a more thorough understanding?  Or is this is a young man's game in which only the elite need apply and I need to consider an exit strategy before it's too late?",1364906524

There are tons of nice games for Linux, or at least buildable on Linux, out in the universe .. its no longer a dirth of 'good games', its just a matter of knowing what and where to find what you like and get it running.<p>I personally am a huge fan of Linux gaming, both on Ubuntu and Android, and as a developer myself have absolutely no problems getting into any game, either distributed or in source form, and getting it running on my system.  I rarely game on anything but Linux.<p>In the last few days, my sons and I have played:<p>* WorldWarVi (fantastic retro shooter)<p>* crrcsim (I play this on OpenPandora nowadays.. the boys have the big-screen Linux machine with the bluetooth gamepads .. we fly and are trying to make models, not there yet)<p>* PacPac (we're making new levels..)<p>* OpenCity (it needs love, but entertains..)<p>* PangZero (nice and easy)<p>* TORCS (makes me puke, the boys now want a proper drivers wheel)<p>* Faster Than Light (mostly me)<p>* Cave Story (mostly the wife)<p>* Serious Sam (also makes me puke, we boys get in trouble for playing it right now tho', but we do sneak..)<p>* Garden Of Colored Lights (very fun!)<p>* FlightGear (mostly me, and I also need a decent controller)<p>* AtomicTanks (mostly me and the elder son)<p>* Voxatron (we play this most of all lately, its just cute fun)<p>So, with many of those games .. the source is available.  Or at least the ability to edit levels.  Some games not so much, but where it exists .. we always poke at it.  And thats not a bad thing for kids who game with their Dads on Linux to be learning.<p>So maybe the answer to your question is, if you're not satisfied with Gaming on Linux right now, wait until another generation grows up with it first, it'll continue to keep improving ..<p>(PS; I'll go review the games above at the new site, I personally love it when things like this get a kick, its certainly worth watching when new game releasers/developers start utilizing these things .. in point of fact, merely keep an eye on <a href=""http://repo.openpandora.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repo.openpandora.org</a> if you want to know where the <i>bleeding</i> edge Linux gaming is happening .. oh and here is my personal favourite Linux game-review site right now: <a href=""http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=all&cat=Game&s=new&ipp=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=all&cat=Game&s=new...</a> ')<p>edit: list formatting

No-one said this 'feels nicer' it looks bad when pictures almost align but not quite with text, or when two columns of text don't align (check out CSS columns[1] for more examples of this lack of attention to typography in the spec messing up layout). If you call this a baseline, you'd probably steal sheep!

There are entire frameworks out there trying to address all the failings of CSS when doing proper design (Bootstrap, Foundation etc all feature grids, something CSS is lacking). It's a shame the creators of CSS didn't consider more deeply the centuries of thought people have put into placing type on a page (or vellum, or a stone wall, or a poster, or a screen, or a phone, many of these rules apply to any medium in varying degrees). If they had we'd have avoided a lot of the hoops people have to jump through just to produce pleasing designs.<p>I'm not clear why this grid is useful for web design, except perhaps as an illustration of another facet of CSS which is broken by design?

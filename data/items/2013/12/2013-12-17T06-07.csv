6919929,comment,6918180,6919039,1,0,smsm42,,,">>> They ask their god for advice and guidance, and claim to receive responses in various forms.<p>I think you taking it too literally. When religious person says &quot;God blessed me with the gift of children&quot;, they rarely mean that the God - as an actual supernatural being - came to them in person and produced their children as a gift. Most probably, they know exactly where the children come from, and were actually present when those were conceived and born, and even though God might have been mentioned on both occasions, rarely they would claim The Almighty was personally present there and did the work. It is a metaphor expressing the idea of the Providence and God&#x27;s control and responsibility about what happens to people. In the same way, when they say &quot;I prayed and God let me see the solution of my problem&quot;, they rarely mean God personally came down to them in a burning bush, spoke to them and gave them detailed step-by-step instruction of how to solve their problems. Etc., etc.<p>>>> Prayer is functionally indistinguishable from divination.<p>Prayer is nothing like the divination. Prayer is an expression of certain feelings or formulae about the supernatural. Divination is a mechanistic procedure in which one would, after performing required ritual, receive information about the future or otherwise inaccessible information. Of course, you can pray for success of your divination, or you can try to divine if your prayer would be followed by some event, but those are two functionally very different actions. Note that for prayer, one usually is required to be a believer, while for divination you don&#x27;t really have to believe in anything as long as you perform the ritual properly. This, btw, is a big different between modern religion and old religions - most of the old religions couldn&#x27;t care less what you think as long as you do proper procedures. Modern ones rather concerned about morals and feelings and beliefs and all that immaterial stuff.<p>>>>  I have, on more than one occasion heard protestants describe various aspects of Catholicism as witchcraft and idolatry.<p>I have heard the whole Christianity described as idolatry. So what? The question if Christianity is idolatry or not from the POV of anybody is not the question we were discussing.<p>>>> whether it is acceptable to ask them to pray on your behalf<p>I can imagine how it may be a problem for an ostensibly monotheistic religion, but that does not make a prayer a divination. Of course, that does not mean actual Christians never engage in practices which are, in fact, divination - but people violating the premises of their own religion is nothing new. I can give you Jews eating pork, Muslims drinking wine and Christians hating their fellow man. It happens. However, the religion as a belief system and as a social mechanism does not endorse it.",1387263531

Each commands a higher ad revenue by being more targeted.<p>It&#x27;s an unfortunate fact of human nature that many boys find toys less desirable if they see girls playing with them too. Toy marketers would prefer to advertise on a show with 10M boys and ~0 girls, than a show with 10M boys and 2M girls at the same price, because those 2M girls might buy their toys, the boys might see them and write off the toy as &quot;for girls&quot;.<p>With a few exceptions, toy marketing is an exploitative business.

It snatches defeat from the jaws of victory by coupling the &quot;workers starve&quot; outcome to the &quot;workers don&#x27;t have jobs&quot; outcome. There is no fundamental reason why they need to be coupled. Just because only 80% of people have to work to meet demand doesn&#x27;t mean the other 20% deserve to starve.<p>Many systems are possible in which marginal incentives are maintained (the farmer and tractor driver get significantly more money than the out-of-work laborers) but the laborers don&#x27;t go hungry. I search for my favorite solution among these (I&#x27;m a big fan of basic income / negative income tax).<p>As you note, we are automating away more and more of our economy every day. If we keep our current course, such automation becomes a club used by those who have enabled the automation (or otherwise accumulated capital) to beat down those who have not. I think that&#x27;s a terrifying idea that at best leads to terrible injustice and at worst leads to violent overthrow of its perpetrators (including myself).

6919914,comment,6919658,6919864,1,0,Brakenshire,,,"I know there are issues which are specific to the States, but I would say this applies almost everywhere. Almost everywhere doctors are paid 5-10 times the median wage, because they are chosen from the top few percent of students, and that difference in wages introduces an inherent asymmetry in how many hours of work are necessary to buy an hour of a doctor&#x27;s time. The majority of the population, certainly as people age, have low level health issues which they manage imperfectly. You don&#x27;t exercise enough because your knee is a bit gammy (perhaps requiring physiotherapy or knee surgery), your cholesterol is high, cancer is spotted six months later than necessary because you thought your dodgy stomach or sore throat was just something minor, etc, etc. And, you know, even in countries with good health provision for the poor, the middle-class still get much better care, because they talk to their doctor friends, know how the system works, research their options thoroughly, and so on. Perfectly reasonable behaviour, but the fact that it is necessary shows up the gap and the inherent limits in provision. The cheaper healthcare is, the higher the baseline and the average can rise.",1387262928

6919904,comment,6914805,6918698,3,0,jjoonathan,,,"That&#x27;s precisely my point.<p>Everybody is exerting &quot;force&quot; on everyone else, sometimes indirectly. The contract between Amazon and the laborer was signed under the duress of threatened homelessness / lack of healthcare / starvation. Amazon signed the contract under duress because it needs people to ship its boxes. Amazon is not special and neither is the worker.<p>Any deal we make must exert force on someone (a restatement of &quot;the world isn&#x27;t perfect&quot; within our framework). So who should be favored? Put quantitatively, there&#x27;s a scale between the minimum price at which a person will sell their labor and the maximum price Amazon can pay for the labor and still turn a profit -- where should the actual price lie? Market economics looks to supply/demand balance for unskilled labor and slides the &quot;final price&quot; all the way over to the minimum. A libertarian would claim that this is just (both parties &quot;consented&quot;) and reject attempts by the government to meddle on the grounds that the market knows best. A philosophy that rejects the notion that both parties &quot;consented&quot; (both were under duress) opens the door to policy adjustments that push prices away from one extreme end of the spectrum, because it sees these as less just. Since Amazon has all the power under the current system, such policy adjustments would favor the worker.<p>I would prefer that this be implemented IRL using a basic income or negative income tax scheme (ameliorate (!=eliminate) the source of labor&#x27;s duress at the source) rather than by implementing a minimum wage, but that&#x27;s beside the point.",1387262715

A computer network can literally aggregate experiences of many different doctors and cases around the world. A new superbug coming out, for instance, may have a treatment that few doctors know, because it&#x27;s more prevalent in another country -- but a person using the network will be made aware of this treatment. The network will have much more experience than an individual. It will aggregate the outcomes of many therapies and studies.<p>4) The knowledge of the network can be extracted from the experiene and be much more extensive. Both beause the experence is extensive and because various methods of statistical analysis can be employed. A doctor isn&#x27;t going to sit there and cross reference worldwide statistics on the success of using remedy X given factors of race, gender, age, etc. The computers can.<p>5) Finally, the judgment. Here is why the computers can beat a doctor&#x27;s &quot;gut&quot; overall. They can cross correlate the knowledge from all around the world and find the most major factors. Then given the symptoms, race, age, location, etc. they can suggest the possible diagnoses given realtime epidemiological statistics and the additional tests that need to be done to establish which diagnosis is most probable. In many cases this establish a path to just one diagnosis with statistical accuracy exceeding what one doctor can produce. It can also list the next several possible diagnoses and the tests to establish them. After the diagnosis is established, it can find the therapies along with risk factors gleaned from all the relevant outcomes from around the world.<p>And this is just for conventional medicine. When we get into genetic therapies, computers and information science will become a huge part of medicine.",1387261978

Similarly, we do not use our armed forces against our citizens, because those two bodies are intended to be used against the enemies of the country.

One may reflect on the degree to which the right to private communications is violated in warfare, but summarizing is beyond my abilities. The employment against citizens of these same tools, honed for deadly violence, is calamitous.<p>More succinctly, what on earth is the use of a polity having military specialists employed against itself?<p>That they have violated our right to freedom from investigation without cause as guaranteed by the 4th Amendment is secondary to the concern of the military running an operation against its own people.

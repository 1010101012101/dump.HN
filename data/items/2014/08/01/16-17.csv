We help students save money, and bookstores become and stay relevant, competitive, and transparent.<p>Metrics: 350 colleges and universities, serving 4.5 million students, tracking ~200k unique book titles, integrating with 7 vendors & 20 retailers, raising the “win rate” for bookstores to 80%, and dropping prices across the board. 17 employees, 3 part-time. 2 dogs. 5 cats. 3 children.<p>Profitable.

Books are simply way too expensive.<p>What surprised me the most when joining was that everyone in the company is very kind, that their customers LOVE them, and everyone is highly performing. This doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone just works long hours and burns out - no, it seems everyone is careful about being at their mental peak and intend to stay that way.

The only worry such a company has is that a larger, more incumbent company in a related industry will undercut them by taking a loss, either through expensive lobbying or aggressive underpricing.<p>Since Reagan, the US has openly been reducing taxes and extending subsidies and bailouts to the largest companies, and finance/media rules have been gradually dismantled enabling politicians to take better advantage of indirect payments.<p>The reason incumbents have been more successful since 1980 is a direct result of government corruption, and is no different than similar patterns within other corrupt economies.<p>edit2: I forgot the incumbent option of buying the competition though the furious M&A that has also increased steadily during the same period, along with increasing weakness of antitrust legislation which encourages the behavior.<p>It&#x27;s sad that we live in a time (due to computing and the internet) when starting or expanding a new or small business is less capital intensive than it has been in history, yet the incumbents have used regulation to make themselves more entrenched than they&#x27;ve been in nearly 100 years.",1406911253

How do you transform a password of, say, 15 characters to 128 bits? You guessed it, with a hash (well a key derivation function to slow down brute force). What they do is I think standard practice.<p>> but not increase the number of possible keys<p>So yes, if your password is weak, then it won&#x27;t make it strong.<p>> while actually lowering security (since hash collisions can occur)<p>But I think you&#x27;re wrong here.

They all know it was your project and you were free to do with it as you saw fit. They disagree with your choice, but it was yours to make.  You had good intentions, even if the actions played out badly, but that&#x27;s all now in the past.<p>Strongloop, on the other hand, has the ability to change the outcome, and have chosen not to. They&#x27;ve been given loads of evidence of what the maintainers want them to do, and so far their actions have not demonstrated a desire to resolve the conflict. Their public responses have been entirely self-serving and barely apologetic.<p>I am firmly of the impression that they want to hold on to Express so they can claim it&#x27;s development as an R&D tax write-off. This fits with why they&#x27;ve stated they would only give it to an organization backed by a non-profit foundation, since then it could continue to be a charitable donation.  They want to make money off this situation, and that&#x27;s basically thumbing their noses at the people who put their time into it for free.<p>As I said in the github thread, there are some major differences between this situation and when Ryan sold to Joyent. Ryan was still working on Node, and Joyent hired both him and Isaac to continue doing so.

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there&#x27;s no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We&#x27;re changing that.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating data problem as we&#x27;re mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody&#x27;s explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What&#x27;s the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?<p>We&#x27;re trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we&#x27;re building a team-facing solution, and we&#x27;re expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all.

8121123,comment,8118696,8120719,2,0,emotionalcode,,,"On a very abstract level, I don&#x27;t really think it makes a difference. If you start from one sub-domain as a primary foundation in mathematics, you eventually wind up realizing you can define that sub-domain easily, using different sub-domains of math. Realizing that is I think, where category theory sprang from. That last bit, I could be totally wrong on - I tried to teach myself category theory and wound up building webs using abstract algebra and formal logic.<p>That&#x27;s obvious if you program, though (to me). What you can do in one language, you can do faster, slower, more concise, more verbose, more symbolic, more literal, and so on, in another. You can build constructions and you can break them apart, depending on what layer of abstraction you can get to. You can call it by it&#x27;s specific name and functionality, in how the part interacts in relation to the parts around it, or you can call it objects and morphisms.<p>I might be totally wrong, again, or using the wrong words and confusing everyone including myself (which is why I like to study formal languages, too). But I think that no matter where you start from, you will eventually find yourself in a place where you are scratching your head, confused about what you know, what you don&#x27;t know, what everyone knows, and what everyone doesn&#x27;t know.<p>Oh, and it&#x27;s probably totally obvious if write proofs, believe in induction, and get very philosophical.",1406910290

That’s our primary mission.<p>The Analyst/Programmer in Enterprise Translational Informatics at the Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMi) is responsible for supervised development and implementation of highly creative and reliable tools in order to optimize informatics solutions in the research setting for bio-repository studies and enterprise translational informatics solutions.

This position demands an individual with superior technical programming skills who can quickly apply this knowledge to define a “best path” for a wide variety of projects. The Analyst/Programmer will develop solutions for a fairly complex organization to yield deliverables such as bioinformatic analysis modules that utilize large and complex data types, data extraction/analysis modules that are dependent on complex underlying healthcare data systems, and process-oriented modules that help maintain patient privacy and further the efficiencies in biorepository studies.<p>The programmer/analyst will work closely with the Applications Research team in Translational Informatics to understand and execute on client requirements, design of solution sets, coding, testing and implementation for programming projects that affect the bio-repository and translational research community.

Our core mission is twofold: to provide a platform for chefs to grow their independent businesses, while making it possible for people to connect over great food.<p>- Line chefs at the nicest restaurants in the world make at most $12-15/hour, yet the food they make is sold to diners at a hefty markup. We&#x27;re trying to bridge the gap.<p>- People are conditioned to expect great food in restaurants — and rarely elsewhere. We want to change the way people eat, while preserving the efficiency and hospitality of a great restaurant experience.<p>- Most internet service companies attempt to decrease human interaction through software efficiency. We’re building a company that does the opposite. We think there&#x27;s something magical about having a chef in your kitchen while you relax and enjoy the company of your guests.<p>How we&#x27;re doing it:<p>- We’re committed to code quality and productivity. With those values in mind, we pair program, test drive and practice continuous integration in a Rails environment. We don&#x27;t work &#x27;startup hours&#x27;, just normal ones.<p>- We&#x27;re a small team (currently 6 engineers). We rotate often between pairs and across projects.<p>- We deploy code whenever we finish a feature. As an example, last week we deployed to production 35 times.<p>- We have a collaborative culture where engineers work directly with product managers and designers to find the best solution to user problems.<p>- We work out of a townhouse in Gowanus right now, but are moving to Soho very soon.<p>Who we&#x27;re looking for:<p>- You&#x27;re interested in working with Rails and pair programming the majority of the time. You want to write tests for any feature you implement.<p>- You&#x27;re more interested in building a great product and shipping features than you are in figuring out the cleverest solution to a problem.<p>- You want to enjoy coming to work each day.<p>My name is Dan, I&#x27;m an engineer here at Kitchensurfing. If you&#x27;re interested in learning more, please get in touch: dan AT kitchensurfing DOT com",1406910181

Though myself should be blamed for that, the conventional classroom teaching and limited access of study material is also important factors.

Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>A few things we&#x27;re currently working on building right now:<p>– The next version of our personalized learning dashboard [1] to make the UI more consistent across subjects and to help people learn better<p>– Improved knowledge models so we can better know what you know and don&#x27;t know [2]<p>– Infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster for our millions of visitors every month [3]<p>– Better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code [4]<p>– A major revision to our iOS app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with iPads!)<p>You&#x27;ll be part of a small team working alongside both &quot;celebrity&quot; devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google&#x27;s first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven&#x27;t heard of but who are also really awesome.<p>We&#x27;re especially looking for new product designers (of all types) but we also have many engineering positions open as well as some positions for a teacher and contract question writers.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> and mention that you&#x27;re coming from HN.

8121021,comment,8120135,8120135,8,0,logicalmind,,,"I&#x27;m not gonna write my life story on hn, but I have the exact opposite experience as you. I grew up in a blue collar family. No real white collar mentors or apparent options in that world. So I followed my dad into the trades. I spent my summers in high school as a plumber (apprentice) and became a full-time plumber after high school, eschewing college even though I was accepted to a number of good schools.<p>After a number of post-high school years of being a plumber it quickly became obvious what type of life this would lead to for me. In particular, the physical toll. You are often carrying heavy equipment or supplies up or down stairs or ladders. You spend your entire day working with sharp edges, saws, and electricity. Accidents occur all the time and any of them can be debilitating.<p>You also have to consider the risk of the impairment of others and what damage it may cause you. Let&#x27;s say a co-worker in IT gets drunk at lunch and comes back to work. He may accidentally drop a table or even a database. That sucks for sure, but in the grand scheme of things, your life and ability to continue working aren&#x27;t impacted. But consider being on a job site with others and the electrician gets drunk at lunch. He could accidently miswire something that could end up with a severe injury to you or someone else. The risks from the mistakes of others upon yourself is much larger in the trades.<p>There are lot of things that seem similar. New development is akin to new construction. Both have maintenance and service. But IT is essentially a virtual environment. The data is important to many people and can even have lives depending on it. But in the trades, it is a completely physical environment. There is no undo. There is no restore from backup. Mistakes can and do result in physical injury and death. It is the difference between coming home at the end of the day sulking that you had to do some user support and coming home minus a few fingers because you or someone else sneezed at the wrong time.<p>My dad is retired now, not by choice. He was on a rooftop holding an air conditioner panel. A gust of wind kicked up and he had the choice of either letting the panel blow off the top of the building onto others below or hold onto it. He held onto it. In the process, destroying his back. He was never the same. That doesn&#x27;t happen in IT.",1406909794

We&#x27;re already cash-flow positive, and laptops, and office snacks, and etc. and so forth. and general good things. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s awesome: we have non-technical customers paying us for an online tool. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we&#x27;re making them happy. And that feels great.<p>But there&#x27;s one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We&#x27;re rapidly adding new features, and we&#x27;re quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it’s time to hire a UX/UI designer.<p>Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they’re flying through their day.<p>You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it’s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do.<p>What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we’ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, ‘make this button blue’ or it could be more elaborate like, ‘add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,’ or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they’ve noticed small, nice design improvements.<p>List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they’re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings.<p>List of Skills: - UI/UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML/CSS is great. At the moment, we’re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount.<p>We’re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square.

Resource accounting inside the network is settled with Bitcoin and purchases of compute instances can be made by users without an account. Additionally, groups of operators can form adhoc hybrid clouds, allowing fast scaling and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities. If you are familiar with cloud terminology, this idea may be one possible solution to some of the challenges in achieving a global cloud federation.<p>It is my belief that crypto currency technologies can bring a new category to the existing cloud offerings of compute, storage, and network. That new category is trust. While conversations about how crypto currencies affect our financial systems are definitely interesting, paying for compute, storage and network with stored trust is an awe inspiring vision of the future.<p>More information is available on the public Github repos for the project (keep in mind the utter.io site is not live yet): <a href=""https://github.com/StackMonkey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/StackMonkey</a><p>The fund raise for the company will be done using decentralized raise methodologies sometime in late September via token issuance similar to Maidsafe or Storj.<p>---<p><i>Objectives and Team Overview</i><p>This is a pre-raise, core team buildout of roughly 4-5 individuals who will join me in an Open Source project that spans two distinct technologies: OpenStack and Bitcoin.  Individuals are expected to be experts in at least one of these fields and moderately versed in the other.<p>I am 47, well versed in both technologies, program in Python/JavaScript, have written all the software to date in the repositories, have started, run and exited other startups, live in the SF Bay Area, excel at fund raising, marketing, leading, and enabling individuals to grow in their careers.  I believe passionately in this project because infrastructure is meant to be open, transparent and trustworthy.  To me, there is not greater cause and it is now my life&#x27;s mission to see this vison to fruition.<p>---<p><i>Desired Skills</i><p>Work will need to be conducted around operational crypto contracts, scheduling of Bitcoin micropayments, integration of blockchain nodes in the appliances, decentralized SSL tunnel solutions, OpenStack deployment methodologies, OpenStack SDN and general network architecture, distributed systems architecture, Python application frameworks, including AppEngine and Flask,  UX/UI/design experience with operational software, and developer focused evangelism.<p>If you find this opportunity interesting, worthy of your passion and you are looking at a 2-3 month timeframe for a change in your career, please drop me a line.

Your life might involve other elements, but for the vast vast majority of humanity, work/career/income is a very significant, necessary foundation for anything else to be possible. Without work you are left to wither and die, with either no or very very limited resources provided to you.<p>This is quite evident in how we treat the disabled when they are judged unable to work; serious disability in the US with no work history? Try living on the maximum $674 per month SSI payment(1), with no guaranteed section 8 housing (wait list is closed in many states for years at a time), and let&#x27;s see how good of a life you can live, with no family support, trust funds, or anything like that.<p>That&#x27;s not even taking into account the countless perennial homeless people that we let languish on the streets, because we&#x27;d never pay to have them accurately diagnosed, or directly allocate any funds so that they aren&#x27;t living a life of abject poverty, filth, and neglect.<p>But of course suicide is still illegal for everyone, disability or not, abject poverty or not, likelihood of improved quality of life or not. We pay lip service to being a moral, caring society, saying you shouldn&#x27;t ever kill yourself because there are other options, but then again we&#x27;d never break out our checkbook or trouble ourselves to ensure those options actually exist. Such societal realities would look despicable if they weren&#x27;t so peachy by comparison to much much worse atrocities humans have committed throughout history.<p>There are a few standouts in Western Europe and elsewhere, where it seems people actually take issue with poverty, neglect, and misery, but that is far from common worldwide, where indifference and schadenfreude are the norm.<p>Sorry for the rant.<p>Edit: forgot the citation<p>(1) <a href=""http://www.disabilitybenefitscenter.org/disability_benefits.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.disabilitybenefitscenter.org/disability_benefits....</a>",1406909301

However polished your app is, you are not bringing any significant value to your potential customers. There are tons of alternatives and many free ones. Basically, you can code and manage a project, that&#x27;s one side of the coin but you are also showing that you are not really creative in terms of building something new, that solves an existing issue and that people want to pay for.<p>Also, I agree with people mentionning the bad screenshots. If I&#x27;m going to pay $4.99 for an app, I want to feel it is a polished app and not a quick chinese knock-off of a popular one (which the current screenshots heavily convey).<p>When a niche market is already full, more thinking could have gone into the name.

You can avoid lightning strikes by always keeping yourself grounded. You can avoid dying in a bathtub by never taking a bath. These are actually <i>way</i> easier deaths to prevent than stopping terrorism, where you have an active adversary who, without your intervention, will work to attack you. There&#x27;s always a cost-benefit tradeoff with every risk you take.<p>Terrorism is an insanely small risk - in 2012 33,000 people died in motor vehicle accidents, which is about 2750 people each month. Compare to 9/11, which was the worst terrorist attack in history, where 3000 people died. Basically, there is accidental death on the scale of 9/11 happening <i>every single month</i> on US roads. And I&#x27;m not even saying we need to do something about that - everyone&#x27;s pretty comfortable with the level of risk they take when driving. It&#x27;s just not a big flashy risk like the kind that shows up on the news.<p>Terrorism probably feels riskier because it happens in big clumps. If you were anywhere except a very specific building in New York or a very specific building in Washington, DC on 9/11, you were at pretty much zero risk of dying of terrorism, but a huge fraction of the people in those two places were at <i>extremely high</i> risk for death by terrorism. By that logic, we should be spending a whole lot more on near-earth asteroid defenses and research into how to stop the Yellowstone caldera from exploding, because even though neither of those things is particularly likely to be the thing that kills any of us, if they do go off they&#x27;ll kill a remarkably large number of people.",1406909189

Can someone convince me why this law is necessary and in the public interest?<p>No, we don&#x27;t.<p>Not only is it extremely expensive to go in court to have such a judgement for such affair, but it is also extremely  complex as you are dealing with international laws and that most countries will not enforce a judgment made by another one for such &quot;superficial&quot; topics.\nAnd on top of that, you can add the Streisand effect.<p>Moreover, you still have the right to access the information, it will just not be shown by the popular search engines, as is the vast majority of the web.<p>This law is there to protect those that get a bad press on the web for things they already redeem themselves, have reach the prescription delay (e.g.: mistakes you did while you were minor) or that suffer from a side effect of some unrelated topic.<p>If you look at the questionnaire, it is long and complex enough to prevent most of abusive uses as it is the current case with the DCMA takedown idiocy.

I&#x27;m 29 at this point, was 27 then. I had to let go of a team of developers, maybe 3 of them, they had family, it was heartbreaking. I still talk to most of them. I went through a really dark period.<p>Few months later, we still hadn&#x27;t raised any money to keep things going and I find out my wife and I are expecting. I basically say, &#x27;Fuck it&#x27;, I need a real job. So I apply anywhere that would even possibly want me, and I end up interviewing at a Mechanical Contractor as a Project Assistant. Just pushing paper for Plumbing and HVAC jobs.<p>Two years later, I&#x27;m running my own jobs, and working directly with union pipefitters and sheetmetal guys. Here&#x27;s my advice.<p>Join the union in their apprentice program. You&#x27;ll be paid well to start with - you definitely, definitely won&#x27;t starve. You might not be making $150 per hour, but you might make $30 per hour all week long, plus the opportunity for overtime. It&#x27;ll take a few years, but you&#x27;ll end up becoming a Journeyman, and that means more like $40-$50 per hour, all week long, with overtime potential, incredible benefits, and more. Working for an established mechanical contractor will help you get more steady paychecks and if you&#x27;re good, you&#x27;ll end up becoming a foreman running larger jobs. The foreman that managed the last project I was on - it was a $2M job - made $65 per hour, plus opportunities for overtime and doubletime.<p>It&#x27;s dirty work.

Too many cheetahs leads to too few gazelles leads to skinny cheetahs and eventually to fewer cheetahs, etc. But that happens because one is the food for the other; the amount of predation is directly related to the current populations of both, and the amount of predation also has an impact on the future of predation.<p>Consider an alternate history scenario: No replacement for sperm whale oil was ever found. Sperm whales were hunted entirely to extinction to keep those big American cars rolling. When the whale oil ran out for good and all, Americans all learned to drive stick. Impact on human population of the planet: none. Impact on the rapaciousness of future generations: questionable. Feedback <i>loops</i> (as opposed to straight-line cause and effect) closed or otherwise in evidence at all: zero.<p>Human interaction with the ecosystem is fundamentally different from the interactions that arise between the other actors within it. Demand for sperm whale oil had virtually nothing to do with the number of humans alive on the planet, and the amount of whale oil left in the world had no impact on the demand for cars, either. With no reciprocal connection, there are no levers for a feedback loop to even take hold of.<p>One might even say that what separates humans from animals, in the grand scheme of things, is our ability to escape from the feedback loops the rest of the ecosystem is in the thrall of, or even to escape from the feedback loops the rest of the ecosystem <i>is</i>.",1321901985

3262297,comment,3261872,3261872,33,0,ramanujan,,,"The fundamental reason that most innovation has occurred in the computer/internet sector over the last 40-something years is that failure is acceptable in this sector. That is, when a computer or webapp crashes it's not the end of the world. But a failure in a drug or car or power plant means serious consequences, and sometimes fatalities, and subsequent regulations/laws to make sure such things are never tried again.<p>Now, you can make a pretty convincing argument[0] that we are as a society committing Bastiat's fallacy (""Seen vs. Unseen""), in that there are more lives lost due to not developing new drugs than there are due to failures of new drugs.<p>The failures are seen, the lack of new drugs is not seen.<p>However, the deeper point is that we are currently simply too wealthy as a society to tolerate the human costs (in deaths[1]) associated with rapid innovation in real world technologies. Wealth means necessities are met, but necessity is the mother of invention. This is why war and serious hardship gooses technological innovation. It's because life becomes cheaper, and test pilots and volunteers for new vaccines become more readily available.<p>I don't think Thiel would disagree[2] with this analysis, but it does mean that the problem can't be solved simply through shifts in entrepreneurial focus. Americans simply aren't ready for the kind of messiness that real world innovation involves.<p>[0] <a href=""http://bit.ly/mtGRyv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/mtGRyv</a><p>[1] Perhaps strangely, we are more ready to allow people to take futile risks like bungee jumping or skydiving than we are to allow people to consciously opt out of various health/safety/etc. regulations (and suffer the consequences).<p>[2] Taking the totality of his statements in context, including the article on the Founders Fund website (""What Happened to the Future?""), Thiel and Levchin's point is not that the iPhone isn't innovative but more that there hasn't been much innovation in big areas like energy, medicine, and transportation. Indeed, by some measures we're moving backwards in those areas: the real price of energy has gone up, new drug approvals have stagnated, and top speeds have gone down since the Concorde was retired.",1321901836

Notice he doesn't say ""Android doesn't have malware"", while the original article (and many more before it) say ""Android has malware"". True, anti-virus won't fix the problems, and true, there is unlikely to be a traditional ""virus"" on a mobile platform, but that's not the point. The point is, malware exists, and it exists more on Android than other mobile marketplaces. Remember the definition of malware, don't get tied down into the Windows classification of a virus. Malware is a broad term.<p>Instead of shouting and screaming and dismissing the claims with the wave of a hand, we should be working to eliminate malware on mobile marketplaces. Chris says malware isn't inherent to Android but the fact remains with an open market and training users that sideloading applications from a random website is safe and acceptable, malware IS more inherent on Android. None of their competitors allow for this kind of free and easy installation of random applications. Google needs to figure out how to stop malware without destroying the very thing that made their OS popular (the open platform).",1321901767

You need a blender to make awesome drinks at your next party.

Then you're comparing 5 speeds for $35 vs $45 for 7 speeds. Maybe there's some other small distinctions, like the finish on the $45 blender which would make it seem better.  You go with the $45 blender because it's the obvious better of the two, and you know nothing of blenders. A store may have some incentive to prioritize the selling of #2, since it makes them more profit, which is why they've shown you these 3 particular blenders.<p>However, there's a segment of customers who will buy the most expensive item because it somehow fits for them. In this case, it might be the stainless steel which matches their other appliances.

3262181,comment,3261872,3261872,-1,0,nirvana,,,"The iPhone contains a key invention, and several innovations.  This is the simple fact of reality.<p>The reason these stories are constantly appearing on HN, nearly 4 years since the iPhone was introduced, is because those who want to diminish the invention of multi-touch, like everyone else, sat awed at the iPhone when it was first introduced.   That was a very magical moment, and if the iPhone hadn't been a radical departure, then it would have been just another cell phone introduction.  It's not often you get to see a new technology that seems magical for the first time.<p>Theil is talking in terms of making a dent in society.  Obviously his standards for a ""dent in the universe"" are different than Steve Jobs.  That's fine for him, but don't confuse it for support for your ideology.<p>There were no multi-touch devices before the iPhone. (and every time I bring this up, some one posts a link to thin-plastic keyboards from the 1970s, or the screens of the automated ticket stand at movie theaters as if they were the same.)  The technology for understanding the shape of the finger when in contact with a touch sensitive display, and being able to reduce that amorphous blob down to a single pixel-- and get the pixel the user <i>intended</i> to touch, instead of the one at the center, or whatever, had never been done, let alone, tracking multiple fingers at the same time, a non-trivial problem.  This invention enabled a raft of innovations that Apple spent 7 years developing that resulted in only the second new user interface paradigm in my lifetime- touch UI.  (The first being the GUI, which was also developed under Steve Jobs.)<p>There's an entire ideology that is anti-intellectual, anti-science and anti-mind at work here. One manifestation of that ideology is support for things like welfare, etc, because they believe that it's just chance that separates Steve Jobs from you and me. (and not hard work.)  Another manifestation of it is to pretend like the products of the mind have no value at all, and one way they like to do this is to pretend like its only ""good marketing"" that made the iPhone successful because it was just a random collection of parts that had been invented before.<p>Sure, LCD screens, Mac OS X, ARM CPUs, RAM, Flash memory and lithium polymer batteries existed before, and with the exception of OS X, all had appeared in other phones.  To them, that means that there's nothing innovative about the iPhone.  Innovation doesn't exist in their ideology, in fact, it demolishes their ideology, so they have to pretend like nothing was invented for the iPhone.  Inevitably, when anyone expresses any defense of innovation you get a lot of nonsense claims about touch panel displays int he 1970s as if that were ""prior art"" for multi-touch. I've even seen people on Hacker News insist that Xerox invented the GUI. (showing either they don't know what a GUI is, or they don't care.)<p>To the extent that this ideology has succeeded in america, we have an economic depression, little growth in industry, a great shrinking in american manufacturing jobs (because this ideology has regulated them out of being competitive with the world market) etc.<p>This ideology might even succeed to the point where a major institution of this country, enshrined in the constitution itself, is destroyed, simply because Google wants to make a competitive phone without bothering to spend 7 years coming up with something innovative itself.<p>That would be a real shame... because the place that road leads is one where the president has a ""kill switch"" for the internet, things like SOPA are the law of the land, and startups have to get permission from government to operate their businesses, just like manufacturers do now, and said permission isn't going to come unless you have a lot of pull.  We've seen what government control over the purse strings in an ""innovative"" area results in:  Democratic contributors getting $500M loans from government for ""green energy"" only to go bust a few years later... its just a looting of the public for the direct benefit of politicians and their friends.  This is the aristocracy of ""pull"".<p>It's instructive to remember that Theil is a prominent libertarian, and thus very clearly not a proponent of this ideology.<p>All this has happened before, and repeatedly. The USA is the last remaining beacon of innovation in the world.  I understand that Hacker News is frequented by a lot of college age or early 20s hackers.  Don't fall for the anti-innovation, anti-mind, anti-science, anti-intellectual ideology that says Apple is evil for inventing new things or putting the product and customer first, and those who just ship ripoff products are to be commended.<p>Don't fall for the claims that inventing is useless, and that america is destined to just be like china (Where everything we make is a ripoff of something invented somewhere else.)<p>To paraphrase Margarat Thatcher: The problem with not inventing anything yourself is, eventually you run out of other people's inventions to rip off.<p>In fact you can see this now: The android market is commoditized.  Nobody is innovating, and nobody is making any money.  In fact, Apples commanding %56 of the entire phone industries profits with only %5 of the <i>smartphones</i>, while most phones still aren't even smartphones. (this is why android marketshare is surging, its becoming the new feature phone).<p>This is a significant lesson for people who want to do startups.   I learned it by trying to sell things on ebay when I was young:<p>If you don't have anything unique or innovative, you can only compete on price.  And that's a race to the bottom.<p>To the extent that innovative companies can succeed, it is good for the startup economy.  To the extent that anything innovative is ripped off, with no recourse, then the larger companies will maintain dominance because newer companies have nothing to compete with, and can't compete on economies of scale.  The more things go that way, the less viable startups become and the less innovation society will have from which to benefit.",1321900208

3262172,comment,3261088,3261088,21,0,socratic,,,"Could someone experienced breakdown what a transaction like this looks like for everyone involved?  I'm super curious.  I've never been acquired, so I really have no insight into the process other than what I've read.<p>Here's the facts as I see them: Crunchbase says Hunch started in September of 2007 and had 23 employees on LinkedIn when they exited.  (TechCrunch calls it a 20-person team, so I'm presuming that's all the employees.)  They've gotten $19.2m in funding, let's just say $20m.  TechCrunch claims the sale was ""around"" $80m.<p>So what does the breakdown look like?  Who gets what?  What are the likely investor terms?<p>My totally naive guess would be that the investors got at least a 1x liquidation preference, maybe more.  I mean, did Hunch have any revenue?  So there was at most $40m to go around to the people at the company.  Of course, most of that probably went to the founders.  Would maybe 20% of that have gone to the 20-ish employees?  So naively pretending that each of the 20-ish employees got 1% for four years, did they each end up with an extra $100k/year?  What's the likely distribution of shares among employees?<p>What are the transaction costs (lawyers, taxes, etc.) for this sort of acquisition?  How long will the employees have to be at eBay to get their earn-out, and will that earn-out be in addition to their common stock in Hunch?  Will they end up being paid less to work for eBay during their earn-out than if they were on the open market?<p>Of course, their are many other reasons to do a deal like this (passion for improving eBay's recommendations, for example), but let's ignore that for now.",1321900024

Simply, they are functions that permute, group, repeat and/or eliminate their arguments.<p>E.g., The T (thrush using the bird naming convention) combinator takes two args and swaps their order: Txy = yx.<p>The B (bluebird) combinator groups it's 2nd and 3rd args (overriding the default left-associativity): Bxyz = x(yz).<p>The M (mockingbird) combinator takes a single arg and repeats it: Mx = xx.<p>The K (kestrel) combinator takes two args and eliminates the second: Kxy = x.<p>There are two schools of 'lambda calculus' that use a set of base combinators to build arbitrarily complex ones. The first school uses B, M, T and I which is the identity function: Ix = x. The other school combines B, M and T into a single combinator that permutes, groups and repeats with one application. It's called S (starling): Sxyz = xz(yz). This latter school uses S together with K.<p>Whether using B/M/T/I or S/K/I, you can build up pretty much any other combinator:<p><pre><code>  B = S(KS)K.\n  E.g.,\n  S(KS)Kxyz, applying the leftmost S =\n  (KS)x(Kx)yz, dropping the parens (which are still implied when not present due to the left-associativity) =\n  KSx(Kx)yz, applying the leftmost K =\n  S(Kx)yz, applying the S =\n  (Kx)z(yz) =\n  Kxz(yz) =\n  x(yz) = Bxyz.\n\n  T = ((S(K(S((SK)K))))K)\n  M = ((S((SK)K))((SK)K))\n  I = SKK. E.g., SKKx = KK(Kx) = K(x) = x = Ix.\n  V**xyzwv = xyvzw.\n  V** is spelled: (S(K((S(K((S((S(K((S(KS))K)))S))(KK))))((S(K(S(K((S((S(K((S(KS))K)))S))(KK))))))((S(K((S((S(K((S(KS))K)))S))(KK))))(S(K((S((S(K((S(KS))K)))S))(KK)))))))))\n</code></pre>\nThe up-shot of all of this is that <i>any</i> computer program complete with arithmetic functions, boolean/propositional logic, list processing, etc. (i.e., Turing complete) can be expressed as a sequence of these base combinators. There are other practical (less theoretical) applications in programming. E.g., Using the T/thrush combinator to improve readability: <a href=""http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2009/09/thrush-combinator-in-scala.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2009/09/thrush-combinator-in-s...</a> .<p>The Y combinator, for which this site is named, encapsulates recursion (i.e., a fixed-point combinator). It's spelled: S(K(SII))(S(S(KS)K)(K(SII))).",1321898666

That's going to have a big impact in the future of technology.  The gestures pioneered by the iPhone (swipe, pinch to zoom) could very well exist 100 years from now and if they do the iPhone will be their ancestor.  That's a big deal.<p>2.  The iPhone saved Apple and Apple changed the conversation in technology. 10 years ago adding more features and giving users 20 different ways to do things was considered an asset.  Now the technology industry has changed direction back towards designing a product and giving the user 1 way to do things that's easier.  I'm inclined to believe we'll eventually reach a happy medium between those two philosophies but there's no doubt the design side was losing out before Apple's resurgence.",1321898615

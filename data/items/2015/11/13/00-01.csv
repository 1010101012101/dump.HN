With the caveat that this probably only applies strongly to people currently in their mid-twenties:<p>For a lot of social circles, facebook is the only service that almost everyone will regularly check and that lets you coordinate events. My friends who don&#x27;t use facebook will regularly miss (or not get invited to) parties, book club, skiing trips, etc. This isn&#x27;t because no one likes them or thinks to invite them, it&#x27;s because they opted out of the platform.<p>The other big point of stickiness that I can think of is that facebook is many people&#x27;s cloud. Years of photos are backed up there and only there. It&#x27;s unfortunate that they&#x27;ve relinquished control of their files to a closed-platform third party, but that&#x27;s the way it is.",1447375994

Or save money. Or some political crap. But really devops is about sharing pain and aligning groups. And not even just Dev and Ops, that was just where it started. Anyone at a big company that&#x27;s dealt with their finance, legal or HR teams knows alignment is critical.<p>Companies that abuse it are basically trying to save money by trying to coopt the concept into an excuse to hire someone to do both jobs (which typically results in average or worse results in one or more of the roles). Or it&#x27;s a power play by an exec. But ultimately it sours the whole thing for everyone that has the misfortune of being subject to it.<p>I know there&#x27;s a boatload of people that have &quot;devops&quot; in their titles these days and while I get that they&#x27;re just taking advantage of a bad situation to make some extra money I still can&#x27;t help thinking that most of them know they&#x27;re hurting the concept by cooperating that way and that&#x27;s pretty shitty.",1447375986

Whether users should be able to run any software (binary or not, proprietary or not) which they happen to have access to, on hardware that they own<p>and<p>2. Whether it is right for people to distribute, to users, software which is useful for a purpose, and therefore attractive, but where the users cannot change or even inspect the software itself (and cannot hire anyone else to do these things for them).<p>The issue at hand was the first one, and you answered by talking about the second one.<p>I believe the usual Free Software Movement arguments go like this:<p>For the first question, it is obvious that users should have a right to use the things they own however they wish – otherwise it can hardly be called ownership.  For the manufacturer to give such restricted hardware in exchange for money, but still retain this degree of control over the hardware after the transaction, should therefore <i>not</i> be allowed to be referred to as “selling”, since the recipients/possessors of such hardware cannot usefully be considered the full “owners”.<p>For the second question, while it is obvious that it is <i>unethical</i> to tempt users to give up their freedom to change and inspect the software, or have it changed or inspected (since this checking and tinkering is one of the things which drives a good society), it is certainly <i>not</i> obvious that it should be out-and-out <i>illegal</i> for anyone to offer such unchangeable and uninspectable software to users.",1447375980

If you&#x27;re eating at a restaurant rather than at home, meals probably contain a good dose of gutter oil too.<p>That should not be taken in any way as being healthy, and because it&#x27;s also relatively recent, the effect it will have on the health population is not yet highly visible.<p>In mainland China they also have a poor concept of proper nutrition and this is exacerbated by the one child policy, with parents and grandparents feeding their only child whatever they want to eat (often sweets, candy, soft drink) rather than what is good for them.<p>On multiple occasions in China I&#x27;ve known children under the age of 5 with rotting, horrible teeth and when I brought it up with the parents and/or relatives (who I also knew) they laughed it off and said &quot;oh it doesn&#x27;t matter, they&#x27;re just baby teeth and new ones will grown in soon and they&#x27;ll be ok&quot;.<p>They completely failed to realise they were setting their children up for a lifetime of diet, teeth and health related problems.<p>I&#x27;ve got no problems with the concepts of traditional Chinese cooking, but it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to find that in modern China.",1447375796

It is up to external checks from a government &quot;of the people by the people for the people&quot; to regulate and contain these factional interests.<p>Federalist #10 does a much better job with the discussions related to factional interest than I could ever hope to fit in to a comment box, as do the writings of Paine, Jefferson and, I really can&#x27;t recommend him enough, especially to the economically minded, Edmund Burke.<p>Also, all of the discussion and legal precedent around the anti-trust laws are very pertinent to any discussions of the limits of corporate power.<p>And yes, in case it isn&#x27;t clear, what I am arguing for is a form of conservatism, but a form not predicated on dogma.

You minimize land and energy use and human labor as well (humans have environmental costs, after all).<p>On the other hand, if you care about <i>animals</i> more than the <i>environment</i>, it&#x27;s probably the worst possible way to raise chickens for egg production.  Instead you want to maximize chicken happiness, you probably want small flocks free-ranging in a safe pasture-land, with chickens allowed to live out their dotage after the egg production has waned.  This, of course, will require far more land and other inputs.

The latter certainly warrants authorship, but I don&#x27;t think the former does.<p>I agree, and the distinction you have made is a big part of why I consider the notion of an academic research programmer to be an intriguing idea.  I think you&#x27;ve identified exactly the kind of innovation that isn&#x27;t really recognized or rewarded through the current academic system.  Your &quot;former&quot; example, for example, might still require a high level of innovation (perhaps a novel way of splitting up a calculation so that it can be solved in parallel on a cluster), but this innovation isn&#x27;t really part of the study itself. How do you recognize this as creative work?  And even if it isn&#x27;t part of the study itself, what if this &quot;solution in parallel&quot; was an essential part of the study (i.e.., solution times without would have been so long that it wouldn&#x27;t have been possible to refine the model to the point of having usable results?)",1447372869

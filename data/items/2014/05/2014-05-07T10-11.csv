US infrastructure is woefully behind compared to other nations (we&#x27;re only recently starting to see fiber optics as a serious competitor to DSL). Even still, as old and outdated as US infrastructure is, the idea of a bandwidth limit or speed restrictions are imposed by the ISP, not actually a physical constraint. Sure, there are limits to the loads a node can handle in an area; But with each node typically serving 200 customers, at a conservative $30/mo... That&#x27;s a $72,000 annual budget upgrade and/or expand THAT SINGLE NODE. A typical ISP will handle hundreds, if not thousands, of nodes depending upon a location.<p>We don&#x27;t need fast lanes or bandwidth caps on the internet.

Interventionism (well, mostly threats, not actual intervention) is what has kept the world stable the last 30 or so years. Stable, of course, relative to what came before and what will come after.<p>> I do not want globalisation, which seems to be your main problem with what I said. I simply made the point that one nation cannot lead all.<p>It not only can, IF it&#x27;s the right nation, but I would say that one nation&#x27;s leadership has lead to by far the stablest period of the last 4-5 centuries. Sure that period is ending, and very few people are likely to find that a positive, but it&#x27;s ending because the power of that singular nation is waning. I&#x27;m not saying the US is the only nation that would actually use it&#x27;s military in a somewhat moral fashion, but given what other nations did when they had their go at it, I certainly would not trust any European nation, Russia, China, Turkey (or generally any islamic nation, even Morocco has proven what it&#x27;s made of) or Japan to use their military right.<p>Because the period is ending, the name of the game is now finding blame for the wars that result from the power vacuum. The reality is that the military superiority of America is no longer absolute (it probably is, actually, but Obama is not willing to bet 100% on it. Then again, Obama has a better view than I do, maybe he&#x27;s right that the US could not easily win a conflict against Russia, or maybe Putin is just a really tough poker player)<p>Of course nobody sees fault with the nations that are mostly guilty of not protecting themselves, guilty of &quot;neutrality&quot;, chiefly the European nations, because they&#x27;re not doing anything, and nobody ever gets blamed for not arming themselves. But the reality is that they are responsible for the escalation. The problem is the hiding behind &quot;neutrality&quot;. As the recent weeks have very clearly illustrated : &quot;neutrality&quot; boils down to supporting the most aggressive party in a conflict, from a strategic point of view. It should be a crime.<p>There&#x27;s one other point I strongly disagree with :<p>> Christianity, as I am sure you know, is in the same religious family as Islam and Judaism.<p>I think the ideas of Christianity, Judaism and islam are very, very, very dissimilar. They have some of the same figures of legend, except of course the most central figures, which differ. In practice this creates a difference that is as wide as an ocean. Christianity and Judaism are basically concerned with creating a society of mostly farmers, a few traders. The goal : expansion, mostly through population growth. Islam creates a society based on constant warfare, with trade taking the place of supply lines (similar to the mongol society, for example). The goal : conquest, conversion through military means and the installation of a legally superior muslim society on top of whatever they found (like e.g. it happened in Northern Africa or India). You may call this &quot;same family&quot;, then I would probably say that Nazism, Stalinism, Communism, European socialism and the democrats are all the same family too. I think you&#x27;ll agree that rather large differences are possible &quot;within&quot; ideological families. Hell, even European socialists differ far more from the Democrats than the Republicans differ with the American Communist party.<p>And that islam doesn&#x27;t match the ideals of modern society is no more surprising than the observation that neither does Roman law. There&#x27;s just nobody stupid enough to attempt to bring back Roman law.",1399459575

This is nonsense.<p>Fact is, the US was a late adopter to more modern drones, or UAVs, having fallen behind countries like Israel and South Africa who had developed  propeller-driven surveillance UAVs and used them operationally in combat from the late 1970s.<p>Both gained much experience in the use of drones to evade surface to air missiles and developed stealth prototypes, including the South African Flowchart, and began early work on weaponising them. As a result, both Israel and South Africa were early exporters of drones, selling to dozens of countries and remaining major sellers. When the US needed to acquire tactical UAVs in the 1980s, it acquired Israeli Tadira Mastiffs. It wasn&#x27;t until nearly a decade later that the first Predator flew, in 1994.<p>Both the above countries have armed drones for sale, though refuse to publicise their sales. So even if the US were to scale back its drone research massively, it would not do anything to slow down this pace of development elsewhere, which has only increased with more countries and companies building drones and their subsystems.<p>It was only in 2001 that trials were first carried out to arm Predators with Hellfire missiles. Not because they were more effective weapons platforms than manned aircraft, but because the idea was to shorten the time needed between spotting a target on the UAV&#x27;s cameras and hitting it with a bomb or missile.<p>As such, most countries don&#x27;t actually need armed drones. They&#x27;re slower and more vulnerable than manned combat aircraft, are not designed to dash to target areas quickly and are typically more expensive to operate than aircraft like the Embraer Super Tucano or Aerosud AHRLAC because they need more ground equipment and a ground control station. The market for surveillance drones, especially those that can provide some level of persistent surveillance, is huge and growing bigger. The number of countries specifically requesting armed drones, however, remains low.",1399457929

Given that in Django you&#x27;re (mostly) explicitly importing classes and modules rather than autoloading, it&#x27;s handy to have them all in one place. OTOH, when your project grows, you end up with enormous model files (especially if you follow the fat models/thin views pattern).

(In a rails project, unless you&#x27;re bolting on engines and such, all your models are at least in one <i>folder</i>).<p>Where I definitely do prefer Django in this regard is that models declare their data fields, rather than them being in a completely different part of the source as in AR (not Mongoid, I now realise).

A language where functions can be passed as values allows functions to be injected as parameters (for polymorphic behavior). In Clojure, you can even replace a function definition just for unit tests without dependency injection at all.<p>For example, with-redefs. This allows you to replace a given function anywhere in the whole codebase with any lambda. This rebinding only lasts inside the scope of the s-expression. When I realized that, I realized everything I knew about DI and interfaces were just hacks of incredible complexity to get around a poor language that wasn&#x27;t built to allow unit testing. I now think it&#x27;s impossible to have both unit testing and a good design in Java/C#. Neither were made to be easy to unit test, it wasn&#x27;t even a concept when Java was made.<p>In C#&#x27;s defense, there is a way to mock a static function by replacing it using the Mocks library.

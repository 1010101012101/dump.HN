414354,comment,412772,413460,0,0,unalone,,,"<i>I don't care about pleasing smart people. How are they better than people who are less smart?</i><p>They're better because they're lucky enough to be born with greater faculty for comprehension. I understand you not wanting to appeal <i>exclusively</i> to bright people, but don't make the mistake of putting down bright people because they've got something going for them.<p>And you missed my point. You can't go out and easily devise something that will get lots of page views. To quote Roger Ebert, a person in a funny hat is not funny unless they don't know it's a funny hat. Look at the big YouTube ""indie"" successes and you'll see the the biggest ones are usually entirely unintentionally up there. The laughing baby. The kid playing Canon in D on his guitar. Yeah, they're great videos. But you can't put up a video expecting it to reach a certain threshold. And if you make videos specifically to meet said threshold, you're fighting against greater odds than if you just go out trying to better yourself as a filmmaker.<p>The point I was trying to make, more succinctly, is this. You can't rely on quantity. If and when you get that many views, it will be entirely by accident on your part. The only thing you <i>can</i> control in your videos is quality. And, incidentally, quality means a better chance at getting quantitative views.<p>Quality isn't about ""pleasing smart people."" It's about bettering yourself through mastering the skills required to make a film. You can go out and make shoddy film after shoddy film and eventually hit a lucky break, or you can go out and try to make your movies as <i>good</i> as possible, and when you get your break it'll be more deserved and, for that matter, attract a better crowd. (When I made my big Harry Potter redub, I got IMs from ""fans"" for a long, long time. I still do, on occasion. It's incredibly annoying because none of them have anything more to say than ""make another one just like that last one,"" and I've given up on the scene entirely. Later works I've done have attracted much brighter, interesting people, and that's a reward unto itself.)<p><i>It does not mean that simple pleasures are somehow lesser pleasures.</i><p>There is intelligence in simplicity. And not all simplicity is good simplicity, either. Don't let that let you think that there's no such thing as quality. There's eating a piece of fruit as opposed to eating a gourmet meal, and there's replacing the gourmet meal with a Big Mac. Both simpler, but with one there's something significantly lost.<p><i>If you can make a video 500.000 or more, it means you understand the how a lot of people think, and this is more important than understand how people very similar to you think.</i><p>You're only ever going to understand your own mind to any significant degree. If you become popular, you most likely won't know exactly how you do. If you <i>do</i> understand it, then you'll derive from the experience either a knowledge of a gimmick - ""These people love me acting stupid, let's do it again"" - or you'll understand it because you're creating a quality experience. It's why the best way of making a good movie is to adhere to your own standards and to focus on making, plain and simple, good movies. Any other way is riskier and will eventually demean you. Quality, on the other hand, always has an audience.",1230655950

To some degree it's a matter of being in the right place at the right time.<p>If Miley Cyrus wasn't part of the Disney machine, she would <i>not</i> have sold millions of albums. She probably would not have gotten a record deal with anybody but Disney. If she did, she'd fizzle out pretty quickly. I've listened to her stuff: it's incredibly bland.<p>Yeah, props to her for actually releasing an album at 16 - though, again, with Billy Ray Cyrus as a father and Disney as a corporate overlord that's far less impressive than her doing it with no roots at all. But don't mistake that for songwriting talent in the larger sense. Look at the history of young songwriters who made an impact in the past, and you'll see there's a radical difference. They innovated. They made something new. Miley is just recycling old things.<p>As I said: it's totally fine that you like her.

Once team size gets too large (say over 8-10 people) random noise and distractions take over. I've seen teams of 30 try to do collocated, collaborative work environments and it just falls apart. At that size, the best I've seen so far is cubes, ""study hall"" and private rooms. That is, cubes for \half the day, a group ""study hall"" type atmosphere for the other half, and easily available small group work rooms. By ""study hall"", I don't mean a bunch of people being quiet, just a bunch of people in the same area working on group/individual tasks.<p>There's an interesting phenomenon that goes on in collaborative work spaces. Many times programmers get lots of benefits from working together <i>but still would rather be left alone</i>. So many times the team requires time that it works together, say for a couple of hours every morning, like it or not. Not everybody likes it so much. Many times there's a gap between ""the way I like working"" and ""the way that I work that is the most productive""<p>Just goes to show that programming is not a technical exercise, as much as we like to talk functional code, security, and all the other bits and bytes bullshit.

A platform is only as good as its apps, and a company that is on the verge of bankruptcy is not likely to inspire confidence in developers.<p>The GP's car analogy falls apart here because when I buy a car, unless I'm an after-market modder, I don't plan to add more functionality to the car. Instead, I expect the car to continue to work as I bought it (aside from normal wear and tear of course), regardless of what other cars are on the highway. I expect my phone, on the other hand, to be able to run the latest and greatest apps and games, so when another platform keeps getting all the shiny apps, it impacts my user experience.<p>Yes, ""true"" multitasking might be a desired feature for some people, in which case it should be weighted accordingly.

No. But if you don't love what you're doing, it's unlikely you'll ever be <i>great</i>. People who are the best at anything reached that point through a combination of natural talent and vast amounts of work. Chris Broderick ( <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpZ645ztl0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpZ645ztl0</a> ) wasn't born this way... when everyone else was hanging out with high school buddies or going to college, he had a guitar in his hands 4-8 hours a day. Loving what you do is more powerful than desiring the rewards. If you love what you do, learning to do it better can feel effortless.<p>On the other hand, having a passion for a topic to the extent that it consumes your work <i>and</i> personal time isn't always a good thing. When you do it in lieu of things friends, a romantic life, spending time with your children or simply resting your mind, you may regret that later on.",1308286554

That is to say, it was a standard designed by a range of domain experts from across the industry, working to the remit of a standards organization. In fact, two standards organizations were involved: ISO and ITU. The specification was devised collaboratively, with its final ratification dependent on the agreement of the individuals, corporations, and national standards bodies that variously make up ISO and ITU. This makes H.264 an open standard in the same way as, for example, JPEG still images, or the C++ programming language, or the ISO 9660 filesystem used on CD-ROMs. H.264 is unambiguously open.""",1308286364

Let me explain.<p>Most of the programmers who produce large products, don't do much in the way of side projects.  Carmack seems to be heads down on Rage.  I don't see a Carmack GitHub project. Nothing from Tim Sweeney either.  I don't see anything from the devs that did GTA or Halo or RDR or the latest Mario game.<p>What about David Cutler?  Linus -- he did Git, I guess a side project(?) -- other stuff?  Any of the iOS architects have GitHub side projects?  WebOS architects?<p>It seems like we have two classes of devs.  Those that ship large products.  Whether its iOS or Grand Theft Auto 5.  And devs that ship little projects.  Small startups, little tools here and there.  The overlap between the two seems rather small.",1308286201

Presumably, balancing a checkbook is a solved problem but an enthusiastic accountant may have brushed up on Sarbanes-Oxley legislation to learn how their craft would get impacted.  Lawyers may not hold mock trials but they may read journals in their spare time which cover interesting precedent-setting cases.  Doctors don't do surgery for fun but they may read up on newly discovered surgical techniques for reattaching severed nerves. And someone in construction might read up on new, energy-efficient construction techniques and materials... but odds are good they don't lay bricks at home.<p>So yeah, don't go home after work and write Hello World or re-implement bubble sort yet again. But do keep up with developments in your craft. If you don't have this opportunity at work, hopefully (for your own sake) you still do take the opportunity outside of work. Software changes so fast that most don't have time during work to keep up. If you let your knowledge get too out of date, your value diminishes rapidly. I think this speaks for a need for more work-sponsored learning opportunities, whether that's courses, conferences, or Google-style 20% time.<p>Personally, I wouldn't want to be operated on by a doctor whose knowledge of surgery stopped in 1960.",1308286178

The ""big six"" are all American corporations that trying to monopolize American media industries, which leads to false sense of freedom of speech among Americans. As you know it will be hard to get this documentary produced and released to an American audience that lies in the middle an information monopolization that I have termed the ""media bubble"". All attempts to break the media bubble from within the media bubble will encounter a devastating attack from the big six corporations. So far no one has purposed a strategy that incorporates gaining support and using resources from outside the bubble. A place such as Europe, will allow the documentary to be very resistant from corporate attacks. While, Europeans might not be as compelled, to donate their money towards a documentary aimed at stopping a corporate takeover in America, Europe still has plenty of characteristics, which the United States lacks, that would be fruitful for making a documentary.<p>Ps. the chart, which is displayed in the article, cannot be zoomed in on and is rather hard to understand.

[1]</i><p>Sorry - I'm kind of chuckling to myself at how hard you're trying to think of this as a good thing for Samsung. Either Apple keeps the technology to themselves or they license it to others and risk others learning from it. This much you seem to understand - but you don't seem to acknowledge that these are the only two choices! Let's put it another way - either Samsung has to pay Apple lots of money to make a SoC to match the iPhone 5's performance, or they lag behind in the benchmarks race.<p><i>Samsung's choice of chips for the Galaxy S II blow away the competition with performance, losing the Intrinsity design is clearly not a problem.

It was Intrinsity's design innovation that set Samsung and Apple so far above their Cortex-A8 contemporaries. And now they don't have that. The S II has a fast chip in it. Faster than what Apple will have soon? No one knows, but I wouldn't bet on it.<p><i>Again, Apple is taking the expensive route with anti-competitive practices, whereas Samsung is learning from others and using its flexibility to overcome obstacles at lower cost.</i><p>The unfortunate truth is that all of the lawsuits that are being thrown around in mobile right now are dirt-cheap compared to the cost of building a new SoC.

It's always good for framework developers to be app developers themselves; and just from the feedback and collaboration today I've fixed several bugs in SproutCore. So, that's a net positive, even though I'm sorry there was temporary frustration while we got to it, and it didn't help that I was in a plane for part of the day.<p>The second reason is that this is just the start. I plan to add many more browsing and filtering capabilities over the next few weeks and months. I hope this can be a good demo for how to build data-driven applications in SproutCore.",1306742292

However what is one to do, when his PHB is incompetent/misinformed and supposedly damaging the company? Just quit? Is quitting the appropriate response to everything? Where are we (as species) going if we resign when something bad happens. Go away start anew and have people resign on us for our misbehaving?<p>Edit: Also what does one do when lets say - working as a contractor and people that hired you intentionally/out of stupidity do everything contrary to what they were supposed to do (a mission critical project and you wait 2 weeks for any response).

2598815,comment,2598778,2598778,4,0,apu,,,"SQLite is awesome because it's so easy to get started with and because it's a single file. This makes it trivial to move around to other machines/backups/etc. You also don't need to setup any server, etc.<p>All that being said, I've now been burned 3x because small ""hobby"" projects I started using sqlite have had major problems when they became ""real"". This is because sqlite is really awful when it comes to concurrency...they're NOT kidding about that in the docs! In one extreme case, I even saw major corruption of the database with heavy concurrent usage. In two of those cases, I've migrated to postgresql, and in one case to redis (a non-sql awesome database that's super-fast).<p>Migrating to a different SQL solution (e.g., postgresql) shouldn't be a big problem if your database adapter is built well. I'm not really familiar with Flask, but hopefully it should be fine. The things you have to watch out for:<p>- SQLite has dynamic typing and is very forgiving -- so it will save whatever invalid formats you give it as-is. This can really hurt you when you try to migrate to something more correct, like postgresql.<p>- Every SQL system has quite different date and time functions, which is really annoying<p>- Pragma's will of course be different, which might be an issue<p>- In general, any sort of ""advanced"" feature will be an issue.<p>Hope this helps, and good luck!",1306741980

When negotiating contracts they can only do it for the people being represented up to that point. Anyone that joins after that contract is signed is on a new, seperate contract. So when a union representative has to bring back the terms to it's members its usually like this, ""the company has agreed on the pay scale with us, but any new hires will be on a seperate contract. Do you vote Yay or Nay?"" Now each union member has to decide if they will accept the contract as it stands or do they go on strike for some ambiguously defined ""future hire"".<p>In fact, this sounds exactly like how our government decides to run its debt. Do we pay it off and take the lumps or push all the hard decisions on ambiguous ""future generations""<p>The fact is people are selfish and unions represent people.

It's ironic that the article labels the rationale primitive societies give for the importance of their media of exchange as ""mythologies that served more as proximate motivators of behavior than as theories of ultimate purpose or origin.""<p>Couldn't we say the same thing about what people think of money today? From ""money is the root of evil"" to our various economic theories, we are just telling ourselves stories that, as time passes, become more comprehensive (explains earlier theories and more). If our economic theories are myths, which I believe they are, then how should we mold the narrative to inspire us toward more cooperation and less starvation and violence?",1306740082

The clientele included a lot of business execs working nearby and they often met for meetings. Some of the regulars were casual, friendly, and very cool, but then there were always a few who had a snobby and obnoxious air about them.<p>I like this as a psychological indicator, not just because of the employer-employee dynamic, but because I think it shows how one perceives their own self-worth, as well as that of others.

2598739,comment,2597832,2598347,13,0,ericflo,,,"""I've done better than them"" vs. ""I am better than them"" is such an important distinction, it really is those subtle differences in attitude that make all the difference in how we view the world and what we get out of the world.<p>Somewhat off-topic example: my mom told me later in life that, when I was younger and I did something stupid and my parents scolded me they always phrased it as ""that was a stupid thing to do"" instead of ""you are stupid for doing that thing.""<p>It's a minor difference in phrasing and attitude, but it's a major difference in impact.  The former makes you feel bad, you understand that you screwed up, and you don't want to do it again.  With the latter, you either A) accept subtly that you're stupid, which has all kinds of negative consequences, or B) you reject the notion that you're stupid, so you don't feel the need to change the behavior and your anger can then be directed at your parents for calling you stupid.",1306739312

I think you will find the freedom you're looking for there. But, it isn't easy, as the ideal of power is nearly hardwired into our brains from many years of evolution. And, if you're successful, you need to realize that you are consciously rejecting much of society's sacrosanct value system, and it will bite you in the ass in unpredictable ways for quite awhile. You may find yourself less successful in areas where power is the lingua franca: business, dating, hell, even friendships.<p>At the end of the day, however, you can only be true to yourself. Success doesn't mean shit if you're not happy. Best of luck to you, you know enough to really set yourself free, but it only gets harder if you go down that route.",1306739048

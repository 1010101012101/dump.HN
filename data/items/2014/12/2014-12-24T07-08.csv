8792033,comment,8787347,8789075,0,0,waps,,,"> That doesn&#x27;t make philosophy useless. It just makes philosophy one part of the system -- a lot of times philosophy generates questions and ideas which are later addressed in a scientific way.<p>There is some truth to this. It is what I mentioned before : &quot;Given that no important scientific advance has ever originated from philosophy ... (ie. the ones by accomplished mathematicians that were -usually posthumously- declared philosophers don&#x27;t count)&quot;, specifically by the don&#x27;t count part.<p>So two points :<p>1) this definition actually excludes most parts of philosophy [1]<p>2) This part of philosophy can only be exercised productively by people who also have extensive credentials in at least one other field (otherwise the &quot;later addressed&quot; part doesn&#x27;t work). Which brings the question, is this philosophy ? Or is this logic ? (taking one example field that&#x27;s well represented in philosophy&#x27;s claims).<p>And to be honest, this is the same argument Religious studies makes. With one huge difference. Most important researchers were actually learned in Religion (vast majority were very learned in Christian religion, and they did credit or at least reference their religious knowledge with part of important discoveries, with Newton and Einstein as 2 very well known examples. Even though nearly universally learned in Christianity, I should probably mention some of them were Jews (including Einstein, of course). But there&#x27;s examples of people of other religions further back. Weird part is that there seem to be very large differences between religions on this point. From the large majority of islamic scientists, for instance, it is well known that they weren&#x27;t muslims, but rather non-muslim slaves at some court [2]. For Hinduism the reverse seems to be true. Like Christians, many Indian scientists credit their faith with pushing them to research nature (and like with Christians, the general population did not always agree with that assessment and killed a number of them for it))<p>I have actually seen this at university. There were several (about to retire, or even emeriti) professors that were monks. Given how they lived, I can understand how that would help with scientific research. One should take a look at, say the Jesuit atlasses of the sky, and you&#x27;ll be impressed with the quality and quantity of their work. They are not just credited with lots of discoveries, but also with absolutely incredible amounts of grunt work, and with keeping knowledge of science spread throughout western culture.<p>For philosophers you can say the exact opposite. There are many &quot;pure&quot; philosophers. None, to my knowledge, have been credited with large amounts of grunt work.<p>And sadly, like Christianity before it, philosophy can be credited with inhibiting science as well. The big current example is research into human races, but there are other examples. From the closely related &quot;bon sauvage&quot; incidents, the &quot;green&quot; morality (believe it or not, nature is what might be termed chaotic neutral, it is decidedly NOT &quot;lawful good&quot;, but we&#x27;re repressing knowledge about this). The same thing is true for research about humans themselves, where lots of things are repressed (e.g. the reason that Freud is so fixated on sexual experiences during early age is understood to be that a significant portion of his patients were victims of paedophilia, but again I&#x27;m told you can&#x27;t say this directly in papers). Humans must be good, especially scientists themselves (e.g. Galileo Galilei was deservedly a famous scientist ... who then decided to become a politician and a horrible, horrible human being. Which of those 2 things got him in trouble with the church (and with the state) ? Let&#x27;s be honest here : the second (otherwise the timing becomes very hard to explain). General lesson to be drawn here : no matter how you are, if you start sending letters to every politician and priest how &quot;their kind&quot; will all get tortured and hanged as soon as he can make it happen, you&#x27;ll be in serious trouble if it appears you are getting a following).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy</a><p>[2] For instance Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwārizmī al-Majousi al-Katarbali, who was instrumental in helping Greek and Roman algebra survive the Dark Ages was very likely a Zoroaster",1419407691

Software updates made Apple TV AirPlay incredibly unreliable for me. And its not just me, lots of people have had this happen. I btw still think Airplay is a stellar feature and if it ever got fixed it would continue to make me stick with Apple TV. 2. The UI sucks:...<p><i>> And of all things, scrolling.</i><p>Navigating episodes/content/movies/whatever on the Apple TV is a very bad experience. Its hard to explain without first using a good experience. On Apple TV, if I&#x27;m on the last episode of a show on Season 1 that I own, getting to episode 1 of Season 2 which I don&#x27;t yet own is very difficult. I have to go all the way up to &quot;more on iTunes&quot;, then choose a season, then get to that episode. On Amazon Fire TV, its just the next episode on the list. Apple TV also strangely sorts episodes you don&#x27;t own earliest to latest, but episodes you DO own latest to earliest. If I go to purchased Tv shows > all, I have no idea what the sort order is. I think it might be most recent, but then the very first show on the list I bought over a year ago, so that can&#x27;t be it. And as far as I can tell I can&#x27;t search the purchased section anyways, so I have to literally scroll down some non-alphabetical list of 220 shows in my case if there&#x27;s a show I&#x27;m pretty sure I bought but I can&#x27;t quite remember the exact name. I&#x27;m not sure how to properly describe this mess, which is why I just said &quot;scrolling&quot;, because thats what the experience feels like on the Amazon Fire TV: you just scroll through content and don&#x27;t find yourself endlessly going in and out of menu &quot;sections&quot;. It sounds to <i>me</i> that you don&#x27;t use the actual Apple TV UI but instead use Plex (on a jailbroken Apple TV?), which is fine, but it says nothing of the <i>Apple TV experience</i>.<p>Edit: BTW, your mention of Plex reminded me of another (long overdue) failing of Apple TV. I happen to also use Plex on my Amazon Fire TV. The install process was tapping the voice button on my remote, saying &quot;plex&quot;, then selecting install from the app store. The process on Apple TV is either jailbreaking, running an app that pretends to be the the trailers server (which may break on any upgrade of Apple TV) or accessing your plex content somewhere else and airplaying it.",1419406302

This is perfectly valid data-race-free code if the CAS is atomic, but is invalid if the CAS is not (assuming no other memory fences).<p>But sure, if you&#x27;re manually fencing then you can have data races that are benign; however, just because something has some relatively rare uses doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wildly unsafe for the general case, and so disallowing by default it helps the correctness of the vast majority of concurrent code.<p>In any case, Rust allows one to opt-in to that sort of behaviour using `unsafe` locally, e.g. one would use `unsafe` deep in the internals of the implementation of the lock-free data structure and with careful vetting to ensure it&#x27;s correct, and then all users can benefit with the compiler ensuring concurrency-safety by default.<p>Rust tries not to completely disallow behaviour, just make memory safety the default.

This is the top-rated reply to my initial comment, so I&#x27;ll try and fill in the gaps.<p>People choose Python instead of Perl because - and the reason they give may be different, but it comes down to the same thing - there&#x27;s one RIGHT way to do everything. There&#x27;s a _pythonic_ way to do everything. PEP 8 not only exists, but people take it _seriously_. Python code is predictable, and while people will bring different engineering approaches to bear on certain problems, good Python looks the same at every company.<p>Go is the Next Level Up of that. &quot;go fmt&quot; and &quot;go vet&quot; are baked right in. The language is small, and explicitly leaves out certain constructs in order that there is one, clear, obvious way of doing things. In short, Go code is meant to be predictable, and good Go code should look the same everywhere.<p>If you want to spend your time thinking about the problems, solving the problems, and zero time <i>decorating</i> your art, Python and Go are for you. They are the International Style or architecture, they are Brutalist languages, and that&#x27;s not only OK, but it&#x27;s a fundamental part of their success.<p>Me? I like Baroque.<p>I like my sigils, I like combining functional and imperative constructs in ways that I think look beautiful as I write them. I like cute tricks, and coworkers can see code I wrote because I come back to my favourite beautiful and intuitive idiomatic patterns over and over again, just as I can identify their code for what they do. I don&#x27;t think `map` is a dirty word, and I love starting with a list and whittling away at it, sorting it, reshaping it, exercising the differences between lists, arrays, hashes, and the coercions between those.<p>You go to the back of the Camel book, and it gives you four different code styles, depending on what you&#x27;re optimizing for. Perl Best Practices is the most controversial book ever written.<p>I&#x27;m still a Rust baby, but I&#x27;m telling you, it <i>TASTES</i> like Perl. The language &quot;features&quot; thing is reminiscent of someone suggesting you shouldn&#x27;t buy an iPhone based on processor speed.",1419404473

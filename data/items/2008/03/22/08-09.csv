No one is going to pg and saying, ""OK, you said our idea sucks, so what do we work on now?""  Instead, pg says, ""Your idea sucks.""  And the founders either say, ""We disagree, but why do you think so?"" or ""Yeah, we noticed.  We're thinking about switching to this...what do you think?""<p>In fact, pg is very likely to think your idea sucks at some point in the process.  I still think he's a little iffy about ours over a year later.",1206176114

I still think a clear plastic gizmo that just uses the sun to distill that merely cleans <i>most</i> toxins, especially biological is better than some giant refrigerator sized, patent encumbered, machine that needs to be plugged in that cleans <i>all</i> toxins.<p>The little plastic thing could be made so small, so light, and so cheap that they could just be dumped out of the back of airplanes where they are needed.<p>How do we teach the villagers how to use them?

And it keeps well.<p>Realistically though, we all owe it to ourselves to eat well. I've lost 10-20 lbs this year (depending on the day) by avoiding carbs and eating my vegetables.

143202,comment,143148,143148,0,0,staunch,,,"A lot of the comments I've read about this essay remind me of the comments on the idea that being in the silicon valley is an advantage for startups. 98% of the negative comments are from people who are responding defensively out of pure emotion.<p>> I work with young startup founders in their twenties. They're geniuses, and play by their own rules. Oh... you haven't founded a company? You suck.<p>The guy that wrote this is saying more about himself than the essay.",1206173362

Over 50 % of the world has more or less of a dictatorship, and that estimate was not including russia. Dictatorships imply no free press, not even free face to face communication. No knowledge of how the government works. A continuous filter in the back of your head that judges whether you'll get into trouble for saying what you say.<p>Freenet not only guarantees load balancing, but more importantly untracability of file storage and originator.",1206172915

6570752,comment,6568660,6569538,8,0,A1kmm,,,"I think that it is better to think about it in terms of the &#x27;colour of bits&#x27;. Bit colour can be thought of as an invisible property that follows a bit around whenever that bit is computed in a way that depends on another coloured bit.<p>Suppose n_1 is picked randomly (from a distribution that doesn&#x27;t take into account any &#x27;coloured&#x27; bits). Suppose n_2 is computed from illegally obtained data. Now suppose that numerically, n_1 == n_2. Mathematically, n_1 and n_2 are indistinguishable, but in the eyes of the law, n_1 is not coloured and therefore legal, while n_2 is illegal.<p>In practice, courts cannot see the colour of bits, so they have to infer the colour. If you claim that some data on your hard disk was randomly generated, but it is exactly the same as, say, a 100 GB copyrighted movie file. The probability of randomly generating such a small file (unless your distribution is stacked towards that file - which doesn&#x27;t count as being uncoloured) is so small that it is not credible that you coincidentally generated it randomly, so the court will likely infer that the bits in that file are coloured.<p>Another more complex example: suppose I give you four bitstrings, A, B, C, and D. Let ^ represent bitwise XOR. Suppose that A is a representation of the complete public domain works of Arthur Conan Doyle, A^B is a public domain representation of War & Peace, B^C is a copyrighted novel (and the person distributing the strings doesn&#x27;t have permission to distribute it). C^D is a public domain representation of the bible. Which bitstrings are illegal? To decide, a court will need to infer how you generated the strings. A is clearly not illegal because it matches a public domain work exactly. B is completely determined by A and the contents of War & Peace. To compute C, you would take a copyrighted work and xor it with B, so that makes C illegal to distribute without permission because it was derived from a copyrighted work. To compute D, you need C and the bible, and since C is coloured, D is also coloured.",1382094885

It seemed more like a test of life skills than school skills.<p>&quot;All the math formulas were provided, thank God, including the value of pi.

I can&#x27;t imagine many documents will include a large number of other content types.<p>I currently work on a site that uses TinyMCE and inserting images, videos etc. is a nightmare. There&#x27;s this combination of the burden of HTML sanitization and the illusion of total freedom that TinyMCE gives to content creators. Something with better separation of content types would be wonderful.",1382094230

Because remember the moment you are free to do anything, you also own up the consequences and failures of your actions. Most people are uncomfortable to be in these situations.<p>People blame their school, teacher, parents, siblings, country, company and what not their current state. But if they were to sit down and ponder, even if the hurdles they state were actually(Most of the times they are not) something they couldn&#x27;t overcome themselves- A scary scenario emerges where you are left staring at your deeper self. You know deep down inside you haven&#x27;t done your part, and you are actually in search of something to blame to justify your own short comings.<p>Beyond all, there is great benefit in victim mindset. Our society shows far more empathy towards victims(Who are presumed innocent and exploited) than failures(Who are considered losers).",1382094175

Surely that&#x27;s the sexist bit.<p>If one offers the same thing to people regardless of their sex how can that be discriminating against them <i>because</i> of their sex?",1382094163

Apple seems inspired enough to bake the good jailbreaks in, except for this one essential (for me) tweak.\n The Iphone was a revolutionary product and a great tool, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s also responsible for millions of hours of lost sleep due to late night blue light. C&#x27;mon Apple start forward thinking again and let us have this as an accessibility option at least.<p>I send feedback every single time IOS gets an update, hope others will too.",1382094008

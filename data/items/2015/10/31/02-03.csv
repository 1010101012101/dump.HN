10481632,comment,10476815,10481112,0,0,sanitychecker,,,"The difference is monumental. One relies on creating a huge, disproportionate, non-transparent transfer of power over the population to various (unelected) actors. Power which they wield over the many.<p>One relies on creating a huge stockpile of data, which we have no reason to believe will be secure, will not be abused now or in the future, or accessed via the proper protocols for the proper reasons.<p>One relies on making service providers extensions of law enforcement and government over the populace.<p>One measure affects the degree to which people will be able to freely express themselves without worrying about how it might affect their future, or the future of the people they love.<p>One measure relies on digital footprints made in the past which can&#x27;t be verified for actual human intent and authenticity, yet can lead to situations where, say, a hacker starts incriminating another person intentionally or unintentionally by creating digital footprints leading to them.<p>Both measures rely heavily on digital footprints that can&#x27;t be questioned or verified or even proved to be accurate or even reliably called into questioned by a person under investigation. In some cases it won&#x27;t even be clear that the digital footprints were used. At least with real time targeted surveillance the use of the data is more likely to be used to identify real threats and used to correlate digital prints with actual crimes, rather than what would occur with the blanket storage of information on the populace.<p>One measure weakens our ability as a society to function as a healthy democracy.<p>One measure is vastly more susceptible to abuse, misdirection, confabulation and mistaken identity.<p>One measure assumes we can trust government and law enforcement and service providers to do the right thing, all the time. Even when there is little evidence for that, just assess how many bankers and politicians are in jail for crimes committed. Unhealthy concentrations of power don&#x27;t serve the good of the population.<p>One measure makes it even easier for bad actors to acquire data and thus power over not just ordinary citizens but our elected officials and people with positions of great responsibility. This can be used to compromise many aspects of government and business and probably already does.<p>At least with realtime targeted surveillance, the measure can be executed upon reasonable conditions. There are no reasonable conditions under which we can justify the blanket surveillance and data storage detailing the mental life of millions of people.<p>At least with realtime targeted surveillance, an individuals breach of privacy is complete, with its effects fairly understood. The damages of which are at least confined to a narrow range of people.<p>With the mass storage/mass surveillance practices the natural inclination will be to expand over time. One years storage will turn into 5 years, and 5 years will turn into decades. It will be incredibly cheap. More people will gain access, more use cases will be used for it. We have decades of evidence that this is how powers are expanded beyond the scope of their original intent. The damage that does will far exceed its benefits, for which we don&#x27;t even have evidence today.<p>One measure is inherently coming from complacent motivations. Much more can be done to create more secure infrastructure. Much can be done politically to limit the proliferation of extremist violence and so on. Much more can be done, and isn&#x27;t done, to persecute criminals with means we already have, but we don&#x27;t. Yet certain parties are chomping at the bit to spend millions on these particularly gross measures under the myth that it&#x27;s needed to do a better job.",1446260002

Manning&#x27;s Early Access Version, or MEAP, enables you to access a book chapter-by-chapter while it&#x27;s being written and you get the final eBook as soon as it&#x27;s finished.<p>Are you a new Java programmer, or planning to switch to Java? Have you been thinking about earning your first professional certification in Java?<p>1) Oracle is offering 20% discount on all its Java certifications (use code Java20-valid until 31 Dec, 2015) to book your exam with Pearsonvue.com.<p>2) Manning Publications is offering 50% discount on &#x27;OCA Java SE 8 Programmer I Certification&#x27; (use code mlgupta3), valid at www.manning.com/gupta3.<p>To prepare for this certification, you should understand Java and the exam itself. You need a structured approach to prepare for this exam.<p>This book includes a lot of hands-on code so that you get a hang of the exam topics. I&#x27;ve used a lot of images in this book. Visual representation of concepts will help you to understand the concepts better. The images also help you to retain the Java concepts, which is very important when you write the exam. I&#x27;ve also used a lot of analogies, to make it simpler for you to relate Java concepts to real world situations. Again, this helps in better understanding of Java concepts and recall when you write your exam.<p>I have created &#x27;Twist in the Tale&#x27; exercises for all chapters in this book. These exercises use a modified version of existing code in a chapter and then they encourage you to determine implications of the modified code. As you know, small changes to code can make a big difference to its output. These exercises will help you to read all code in the exam very carefully.<p>During the MEAP (and later too), I&#x27;ll answer questions related to this book, posted at Author&#x27;s Forum, hosted at Manning&#x27;s website. Please post your queries, comments and feedback. They are important to me.<p>Thanks.<p>With much respect,\nMala",1446259787

If there are no security vulnerabilities in the trusted hardware, then there is literally nothing special Apple can do to help unlock it. Although we can hope for a stay (in the sense of not advancing the inevitable big picture) whereby USG successfully attacks the chip with acid.<p>There may then be a detour where USG attempts to compel Apple to push an update to a new (and unknowing) suspect that renders their security moot. This entire process would be under a gag order (since it&#x27;s an ongoing investigation), so perhaps it&#x27;s even already happening. Once again, I guess I hope this is successful to avoid the otherwise inevitable showdown.<p>The next move directly pertaining to this situation will be for USG to push for some law banning the sale of encryption that cannot be opened with a court order. Yes, this battle has been fought before. But this time we&#x27;re dealing with a purpose-built device, distributed turnkey by a commercial company. USG may not be able to compel Apple to act, but it can certainly constrain their actions when they do.<p>Also, technology is now acceptable to put on the &quot;news&quot; so the entire populace can be browbeaten with the four horsemen to make them compliant and dilute techies&#x27; informed voice. The percentage of civil disobedience will be insignificant - LUKS will likely not be setting precedent.<p>Plus the major technology companies having become part of the establishment and vice-versa, so cooperating with the government is in their direct business interest (as long as the PR is managed). In this larger situation, Apple will cry uncle long before USG does - I doubt they want an import ban.<p>So all of this points to such a law being passed, I&#x27;d guess 2-3 years out. If Free solutions aren&#x27;t outright criminalized by the same legislation (ala RIPA), then something supplemental after that. It&#x27;s a lot easier to &quot;address&quot; questions of constitutionality and basic human rights against a single unsympathetic defendant.<p>Will we successfully retreat to steganographic filesystems, and can we encourage enough drug dealers et al to adopt them such that the leviathan encounters effective technological pushback?

Or is it a fool&#x27;s errand?<p>I&#x27;m from a non-software field in my 30&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m tired of grinding it out with a salary that can barely cover the expenses.  I&#x27;d like to work remotely and live somewhere more affordable.<p>I don&#x27;t expect anything to happen right away, but over the next 5 years.  Because I don&#x27;t see myself saving my way to retirement, owning a business where you control your time is the only end game I can see.<p>I like building apps and take pride in my work, so it seems like a good avenue for me.<p>Thanks.",1446257204

Clearly that does not happen.<p>The reason is the buffer between you and the car in front of you is eaten by the difference in your speeds.  Going from 80MPH to 70 MPH takes ~0.7 seconds, where starting to break takes ~0.2 seconds.  Even if there is just 5 feet between cars the signal propagates plenty fast.",1446256922

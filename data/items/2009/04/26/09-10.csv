I think they found that the longer a granny lives, the better her grandchildren fare (and the more she might have). However, a similar relation was NOT found for granddads, so it is apparently still a mistery why men grow so old (last I read, there might be more info by now).",1240739950

People are saying things that can cause panic and so people who take what others say at face value without confirmation will also be panicked.""<p>The most alarming statement in this article was ""The question of whether we need to somehow alter our global information flows during global pandemics is not a trivial one"".

""god and country."" Not Milton Friedman. Not Irving Kristol. And not ""right-wing"", which is an ideology. Conservative might really mean Edmund Burke, but I think the linked article means Pat Buchanan.<p>Smart: is context dependent and means making the best decisions in a given context. In some forms of human endeavor being smart requires higher than average intelligence, like say being a surgeon. But most aren't especially aided by intelligence. Definitely not politics or business. Too much intelligence can even cause stupidity in some situations.<p>I'm not sure what the word liberal means to you, but to me, in this context, it's meaningless.",1240739765

Chrome will take FF's 30% market share, and IE will keep the rest.<p>Firefox has done its job:  It forced MS to release IE7 (and 8), and it inspired Google to build Chrome.  That's a good run, and the web will be better off because of it.  But now it needs to fade gracefully from the scene so that we move on to a world where we only need to develop for two dominant browsers.",1240739184

You probably won't go to any until 2nd or 3rd year.  In the mean time, steal liquor from the 24 hour Ralphs supermarket by campus and sneak them into the dorms.  If you want to go to campus parties just drive to visit your friends at UCLA.<p>Every quarter there is an on-campus festival where everyone gets SHIT faced drunk on campus.  Sun god festival is one of these - honestly I've never seen anything like it at any other college.  It's kind of ridiculous how far people take it since they don't get to party on campus.  There are 2 bars on campus though if you feel like getting a beer.  Make sure you have a real good fake ID though.<p>The cliffs by Blacks beach is a good place to bring a girl at night.  Just don't fall into the ocean.  If you get kicked out of the dorms for smoking pot or drinking, don't worry, it's not a big deal.  They can't even tell your parents.  I had a friend who got kicked out so far into the year he just didn't even move out, they refunded his money too.  He bought BBQ for everyone for the rest of the year.<p>Teach yourself CS on your own time and major in something that is less demanding academically.  Learn how to surf.  Use RIMAC to work out so you don't get fat.  Spend your meal points at the convenience store in warren instead of the dining halls.<p>Here's a tip for when you live off campus: instead of buying a parking pass, park in the Ralphs parking lot and ride the shuttle 2 stops to the top of the hill.  They may have started cracking down on this.<p>One more thing - STUDY ABROAD FOR HALF A YEAR.<p>I'm getting sort of choked up writing this post.",1240739106

579850,comment,579314,579314,0,0,cturner,,,"Reminds me of the Bloomberg UI approach, which is an established GUI that is an interesting blend of command line and GUI. I'm confident that this interface approach could be used to create a better hitchhikers' guide to the galaxy than the current mouse-oriented HTML+DOM+JS+flash horror. Part of the trick with a keyboard-oriented platform like this is that under no circumstance can something be allowed to hijack the keyboard to prevent you from getting back to the command-line in the way that flash does at the moment.<p>In Bloomberg, users type sequence of commands into a fixed console that is similar in concept to a browser bar. Pressing return causes the application to load. You get command-line power and more visuals than are possible in curses. I think this is so far the best example in common use of a blend GUI.<p>For the purpose of discussion, it's a shame its distribution is on an exclusive platform. If anyone has access to a Bloomberg terminal and necessary skills to export the video signal to a system whereby a video can be taken of it, it would be great to have some demos of this interface on youtube for demonstration.<p>My memories of it are weak - I've only had opportunity to play with it myself a couple of times. Every time I see it demonstrated I'm impressed by the model but think of a dozen things I'd want to improve about it.",1240738896

It's part of the same hype culture that I despise.<p><i>Growth Businesses</i><p>Google is a technology and product breakthrough - Pagerank, GFS, BigTable, MapReduce, AdWords, Server Design etc. Amazon - Cloud Computing, Recommendation Engine. Facebook - Social Graph. These are deserving growth businesses that have built out a true market niche.

What can we do to have less ineffective discussions?<p>If you think discussing the subject is pointless because discussing equality is useless, then... fuck knows, there's not much point in discussion is there :P<p>Additionally, it's worth pointing out that Matt, having heard and taken the criticism he was given, responded by removing a number of risque images from the presentation that is now posted on the ultrasaurus thread linked up here.",1240738231
579842,comment,579690,579690,0,0,hbien,,,"I'm a recent graduate from UCSD CS program.  You'll hear a lot that the UCSD campus isn't very social, it's true.  This has to do with the focus on ""academics"" so we don't offer any scholarships to athletes and we don't have frat houses on campus (no parties on campus).  On weekends, the campus is pretty much dead.<p>If you do go to UCSD, I hope you picked Warren college.  You'll live right next to the computer labs.  It was pretty awesome, I lived @ Black Halls which was a 30 second walk to the CS building & labs.<p>The CS classes are pretty easy, I managed to graduate in 3 years by taking 16-20 units a quarter and I know a guy who did it in 2 years.<p>I never met anyone who was interested in YC or doing a startup.  The mentality seemed to be get a good job in the corporate world.  I regret not meeting more CS students, especially looking harder for people who want to do their own startups.  Luckily, I live in Silicon Valley and there are a lot of us here =].<p>A lot of the CS professors are pretentious, I got the feeling that they didn't care about teaching students.  There were some awesome teachers though, like Rick Ord who teaches assembly and compilers.  Plus there's a great ""Games Class"", where you're given a quarter to make a 3D network game.<p>If you're interested in getting some real world experience there's AIP (Academic Internship Program).  They will hook you up with an unpaid internship but it counts towards your credits.<p>Also, the sweetest jobs in the world are at ACS (Academic Computer Services).  It really helps when you have a full course load to have a job where you can study most of the time.",1240738185

It just can't hang with the intellisense features of VS.NET.<p>I spend entirely too much time in Eclipse hitting ctrl+space and getting nothing back.  Often even when the thing I'm looking for is in the same file, let alone included thru an import.  ReSharper will find references for things I haven't even imported.  It really is that much better.<p>Oh, and VS.NET does have open source and commercial plugins (of which ReSharper is a good example.)  It's every bit as open as Eclipse as far as extensibility is concerned.<p>In general, I find it's best when offering comparisons of two products to have actually used both products.  That is the basis by which I consider VS.NET to be superior to Eclipse.  I'd suggest you try them both before making up your mind for good.",1240738142

He's just not, by any definition (except maybe some right-wing nutjobs, given that he's French and all, but then they'd probably call him a morally loose, cheese eating surrender monkey, more than an asshole).<p>He promotes tech, he contributes to the community, i've never seen him be mean or rude to anyone.  If his wife and the others he keeps company with are any indication, people like him and thinks he does well by others.<p>I saw the title and thought it was tasteless (i wasn't actually at GoGaRuCo), and maybe i should have said that it would have been upsetting, but i genuinely just thought it was going to be tasteless, not something that would offend (There's a book called ""How to make love like a porn star"" with the subtitle ""A Cautionary Tale"").<p>It's possible that Matt's presentation could have been executed in a manner that didn't offend.  Nor was his intent juvenile, as you have asserted.  From what he's said, he seems to have thought that people would be liberal (i don't mean that politically speaking) enough to handle the subject matter, which i think is a mistake he is not likely to make again.<p>So, there's the disconnect.  Matt had one impression of how his presentation would be received, and that assumption did not go challenged until after he delivered the pesentation.  The audience, not knowing Matt, have different assumptions and boundaries on what is and isn't appropriate in a presentation.  I'm willing to go so far as to say Matt was wrong on this.  He made the wrong decision.  But he didn't do it because he's callous, or mean, or misogynistic.",1240737346

As far as the compiler can see a function call, and can see the caller has nothing to do except returning the result of the call, then the compiler doesn't need to know which function is called (It doesn't even matter if the callee has some ""wrappers"" like decorators.  The caller can just jump to the wrapper entry).<p>Is there something peculiar about Python that makes it difficult?   (I don't understand how your self.worker example prevents tail call elimination, but maybe that's because I don't know enough about Python.)<p>> Secondly, it is difficult to deal with a tail recursive call inside a try-catch block.<p>A call made inside try-catch block is <i>not</i> a tail call, almost by definition.

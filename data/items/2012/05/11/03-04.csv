The internet is still not a proven business model for distributing shows profitably.<p>While I agree with others in this thread that an a la carte model is the correct one and would likely work, there is very little middle ground for them (HBO, TW etc.) in between selling their shows to cable companies and going completely independent and distributing through the internet.  As soon as they start doing that the cable companies will stop paying for their shows, and then at <i>best</i> there will be a long period of time while people switch over to consuming everything over the internet.

Move your ass and eat your veggies.<p>The connection between cholesterol and fat intake is tenuous at best.  You're likely to be able to cut your total cholesterol levels by less than 15 points through a low fat diet plus exercise unless it was ridiculous to start with.  In my family a healthy diet results in a total cholesterol level of around 250, while a strict low fat diet will bring it down to 235 or so, far above the recommended level.<p>As far as blood pressure is concerned, nearly everyone develops hypertension eventually.",1336705243

They simply cannot provide Internet purchasing of their content.  You don't really know what the CEO <i>actually</i> believes because <i>saying</i> the Internet is a fad plays directly into his market (the cable companies).<p>At this point in time, it might make more economic sense for HBO to ignore the Internet.  Although, I certainly hope they're planning for the future.  And if they are, it would still be foolish to let the cable companies know that.",1336705233

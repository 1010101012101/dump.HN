I don't see a need to <i>also</i> come out financially ahead of those who had the misfortune to need the surgeries, so I win the health lottery twice and they lose it twice.<p>The moral-hazard problem also seems pretty weak, at least when it comes to major things like surgeries; I doubt there are many people who would've avoided getting cancer if they had to pay for it, but if it was free decided hey what the heck (that is, the suckiness of major illnesses is already a bigger disincentive than the expense of treatment).

The sites are also a great way to introduce programming to people who otherwise wouldn't have known they'd enjoy it.  But I think we're kidding ourselves if we believe that even 25% of the people signed up for Code Year actually start coding.  Programming (not programming quizzes) is hard.  People, in general, don't like to do hard things.<p>I wrote a lot more about this here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3509620"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3509620</a>",1327979047

In the end,  this is probably the opposite of what the SFC intended and may result in the loss of their greatest legal tool.",1327978903

When pain in your mouth is approaching the 6-10 range you're playing with borrowed time at that point.  It's far cheaper, pain-free and healthier to:<p>* Invest in a great tooth brush.<p>* See your dentist at least once a year - and there are a lot of bad dentists (just as there are bad doctors) out there, so do some homework and avoid the ""chop shops"" of the dental world.<p>* Eat healthy.  We juice every day (once or twice) and greens like parsley, kale and spinach do a fantastic job of promoting a healthy mouth - the parsley does a great job of controlling bad-breath-bacteria as well.<p>* Avoid amalgam - ask your dentist to do composites.  The amalgam filings require much more tooth structure to be removed compared to the same filing using composite.  Plus, no mercury (amalgams have been banned all over the world already, but for some reason the ADA still has their head shoved in ass state side).<p>* Floss and scrape your tongue.<p>Pain free.  :)",1327978847

This must have happened the last 4-5 years.<p>Still, the links in my previous post are about purchasing power, not GDP/capita. But you're right, they are at least much closer now.<p>Actually, this is pretty good news for the US, because Sweden was in a terrible mess in the mid 90s but managed to clean things up in a relatively short time (less than a decade). Of course, the US economy is much, much larger, but it's worth noting that things can get better rapidly once you're on the right track again.<p>EDIT: here's a graph from 2009 showing GDP/capita where Sweden is still far behind the US:

2119489,story,,,1,0,tdoggette,"An ethical, focused content site with well-targeted ads?",,"There's not much really good information out there for a naive smartphone buyer-- reviews cover incremental improvements in technology and arbitrary lists of pros and cons that don't really touch the issues of what makes a particular phone good or bad for a potential buyer. And, after a phone is bought and a contract signed, there's not much to support a user who's got a phone and not much practical information on what they can use it for.
Here's the idea: a site that does more than review (or aggregate reviews)-- a site that guides a potential smartphone customer through their options and lays out the real differences between one $100 Verizon Android phone and another.<p>Beyond that, people who buy smartphones don't get much support from their carrier or their phone's manufacturer after the contract is signed. Most phone buyers aren't checking out appbrain and browsing their phone's app store. This site would offer straightforward ways for people to get real utility out of their expensive hardware.<p>The core of the content, alongside links to others' video reviews and so on, would be a few paragraphs dealing with practical considerations in plain English for the non-technical user, for phones, apps, carriers, and technologies. The value added is a distillation of the issues that a technical consumer can get elsewhere. Mainstream journalism is lousy for helping people gain useful understanding of issues like this, and the kind of person searching for help is also the kind of person likely to click on very well-targeted ads about the products that they're now well-informed about.<p>Do you thing there's enough value here to make a site along those lines? Is there enough money in targeted phone and accessory ads to make it worth the effort to build a trustworthy site that ranks highly for http://www.google.com/search?q=what+smartphone+should+I+buy ?",1295437560

So phone sales only exceeded Apple's in the US 2 or 3 quarters ago, and we only had data showing that about 1 quarter ago. Installed base is <i>estimated</i> to be moving above iPhone right about now, iOS (including iPads and Touches) will obviously take longer. Android share of the tablet market (the Galaxy Tab basically) is already at 25% for the last quarter apparently.<p>So in summary, anyone claiming Android was already ahead of iOS wasn't using any reliable figures, and mostly I've seen this in reverse (i.e. if Android is so far ahead where are all the quality games).

In the US you can create some practical experience (home projects) for yourself and usually find a lower-paying entry level position with a smaller company. After a few years experience you don't get asked about your lack of formal education anymore (this is what I did by the way, I have a Sociology undergrad).<p>In London, I found that people are much more interested in degrees and pedigree. Job interviews often started with education questions first, and I feel like I was considered less valuable because of the lack of CS background (that was my opinion at least).<p>In Switzerland, where I am now, the people I encounter place a very high value on training programs. Scrummaster training is more valuable than Scrum experience and programming certificates are important in a way I never expected. However, the Swiss have a very strong culture of apprenticeship and ""Lehrling"" programs, and both shops I have worked in have many more interns than I have seen elsewhere. And the interns are often in the last phase of their Masters degree!<p>This is all just experiential and not very quantitative. But my answer is it depends on where you live.

I find a lot of good, technical comments end up quite a way down the page in more detailed discussions between users who are more interested in the subject matter than having a conversation (or having their joke voted up the page.)<p>Really, I wish Reddit had something closer to Slashdot's moderation categorisation to filter on. Filtering out ""funny"" comments would be nice. Ignoring votes cast by people who just want to register their agreement or disagreement would be an incredible, impossible goal.",1295435672

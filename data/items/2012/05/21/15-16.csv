4003440,comment,4002638,4002638,3,0,christianbryant,,,"I would over-simplify this by saying true innovation is being killed by popular social media in general.  The real reason for pointing to Facebook and similar sites is that, popular media focuses all its attention on these sites, and so, then, do investors.  But why isn't extreme tech cool?  Why can't groups like SpaceX get the same wave of investors and popular media support that an app like Twitter can get?  In particular, I think project like SpaceX need to be better supported and more visible so the level of quality embedded in their processes is as high as possible.<p>""Give the people what they want"" is fine, but what if they don't know what they want?  What if, more than yet another way to splash pictures of their dog in a dress across the Internet, they really want to see experience their web browser in full immersion VR?  Or fold their computer into the shape of a pocket map after their done teleconferencing with Tokyo?  I love my LAMP as much as the next guy (though my P has been more R(uby) of late), but come on, simple isn't always better, and that goes for code as well as ideas.<p>That's my beef.  Not with Facebook or Twitter specifically, but with the continued support of mundane ideas rather than ideas that will put us into other solar systems, or computing at the quantum level.",1337615967

4003431,comment,4001727,4002231,16,0,hersisteralice,,,"TL;DR I actually made an account to reply to this<p>Hi, sister here. It's 8 AM and she's (^) currently sleeping soundly near me, but I'd thought I'd contribute my own 2 cents on the whole matter.<p>I'm Alice, and I've grown up with a partially deaf sister whose hearing has gotten progressively worse in the recent years. I've watched her listen to me with ease years ago to leaning over and struggling to what I have to say now today.  I'm currently studying music and aspiring to be a composer, and what does scare me is the thought that my sister won't be able to listen to my music when the time comes. She's the one who's supported my endeavor the most.<p>And now that I think about it, I never really ""feel"" that she has this hard of hearing situation. It's never been that way to me, I just accepted her since I was young and we've both been raised normally together like everyone else except for those awfully boring visits to The Hearing Doctors in which I frittered waiting around whining what's for lunch.<p>My sister has been fortunate enough to have the opportunities to grow into the person she is now. Of course, that doesn't undermine her struggles at all, but I understand that everyone has a different experience even within a group of relatable topics. I'm glad that my sister's never been socially isolated or bullied, like another close friend that I have.<p>I'll call him C here. He's an online friend (real as any other friend) and I cherish him a lot. He's 21, partially deaf, and has had cochlear implants. His life experiences differ a lot from my sister's. He's faced much adversities. C's been bullied when he was younger, has gone through depression, been socially isolated (at one point homeless) but is making considerable progress today in his game design education and I believe he'll succeed on his own someday. There was a time I didn't understand why he was so self conscious about his voice. The first time I heard him, I realized his speech was slurred - especially with the 's' and 'l' if I remember correctly. Once I got past a certain threshold, it was fairly easy to understand him and I didn't pay too much attention to some pronounciation difficulties.<p>Although we've been slowly drifting apart and now we're busy immersed in our lives, I won't forget the stories that he's told me or the things he's taught me. OP, thank you for posting your story. You sound like someone's who been through a lot.<p>And also -- don't give up on romance. I forgot to mention that there was a point in time that I liked C (romantically!), and he knew that very well. What can I say? I was attracted to his wisdom and motivation to keep on going, no matter how tough things got. :)",1337615877

4003410,comment,4002873,4002873,5,0,tomku,,,"For your Supervisor deployment to actually be secure, you need to make a couple changes.<p>First, you should be using a separate root-owned virtualenv for Supervisor itself.  If you use a virtualenv owned by another user, that user can effectively cause arbitrary command execution as root whenever Supervisor starts by modifying the virtualenv activation script.<p>Second, the Supervisor configuration file itself should also be root-owned and specified using the -c switch for 'supervisord'.  A malicious user with access to the Supervisor config file can do all kinds of malicious things with that access alone, usually starting with disabling the privilege dropping and proceeding to overwriting arbitrary files as root.  You should always specify the path to the config file as well, because otherwise Supervisor looks in the current working directory.  That's harder to exploit, but it's better to be safe and have zero chance of a root-owned process reading a wrong (and possibly malicious) config file.<p>Fixing this stuff is probably beyond the scope of the article, but they're things you should consider if you plan on deploying Supervisor on production systems.",1337615606

First, you have to buy an overpriced item from their catalogue. A $50 quart of ice cream or a $25 homemade candy bar are just two examples.  Not novel at all. Second, if Im going to spend that much on a gift, then they better be a close friend/family. No way I can afford to do little events. Third, I have to pay shipping fees so the cost adds up pretty quick. And fourth, I cant make this a group gift.have others chip in.  The only social aspect is that the gifting is done through Facebook.  Wow.<p>For the past few months, Ive been using EventSmart (www.myeventsmart.com) which is really what social gifting should be. Its free, the recipient can buy anything they want, and I can invite others to chip in. You can also contribute as little as $5 for anything. For example, recently a close friends son had several surgeries on a broken leg. I started a gift, chipped in some money and then invited some mutual friends who contributed as well. EventSmart collected the contributions and then let my friends son transfer the funds onto a gift card. He ended up buying some video games through Amazon. No fees. No overpriced items from a limited catalogue. Several people all contributed. Now thats social gifting!<p>Karma is good marketing with no substance. Their mobile app is nice, but their offering is terrible. Id never use their restrictive service for overpriced stuff.

Those values are treated as pointers even if they're not pointers, so the data they point to is assumed to be used and is not garbage collected.<p>Architectures/ABIs with 64bit pointers have a much lower probability of arbitrary values mapping to active memory space for the process, so memory bloat caused by the conservative GC strategy is much more limited.<p>The x32 abi looks like it would suffer from this 32bit conservative garbage collection problem too.  Short of changing the VM strategy, using 64 bit pointers is the only way to ensure that such VMs do not accumulate so much unused but not-garbage-collectable memory allocations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3814020"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3814020</a>",1337613510

4003207,comment,4002241,4002241,6,0,ouriel,,,"Hi there. This is ouriel co-founder of appsfire<p>Thanks for the comments and interesting conversation. Here is a comment i just posted to the author of the post. I hope it brings some light on the situation.<p>====================================<p>i wanted to follow up on your note regarding app booster.<p>First off App booster is a dialog system between the developer and the user. It includes a among other elements a simple feedback system which is not a review UI. It is a way for users to simply and directly contact the developers. Like thousands of apps we had at the beginning a simple email feedback system, but we realized that all it was creating was poor quality feedback - mostly blank emails. Many developers were in the same situation. So we decided to create our own app specific, mobile feedback system.<p>The idea behind this feedback system was, unlike the app store, to allow the developer to have a chance to respond before the user posts a bad review. Many times bad reviews are published for the wrong reasons and are wrongly attributed to the developer who has no chance to answer in the app store (eg users complaining of an app performing poorly, when the problem was the wifi connection or poor 3G connection..). We had to create a system that allow the developer to have a chance to answer first. If we were suggesting the user to drop a negative review in the app store, then we would simply kill that possibility.<p>When a positive feedback is sent, it is mostly likely one that does not need an answer and it felt right to entice the user to visit the app store to publish a review there. Note that unlike other methods you are describing in your post this is not forced to all users by a popup, It is natively integrated in the flow of a user already satisfied in the app. Jumping from there to the app store is not incentivized or rewarded in anyway (your post does not mention those methods used by many apps who will ask for a like on Facebook or pay users to review apps which are clearly manipulative methods). The review comes in context in a full optin way, with no tricks.<p>When using App booster, Users know they are not submitting a review to the App store and they send ""Feedback"" to the developer because this is the app messaging system. I am not sure why you would consider it differently and i would suggest an edit to your post. You seem to indicate we may try to confuse user with that approach?<p>We don't agree with your interpretation this is manipulation. As a matter of fact we believe this is the right thing to do. It just makes things right for the developer and the user. No one is forcing any one and a real dialog can take place. The real problem is that the review system is broken in the app store. It is being gamed, it is being manipulated, but you should look in a different direction: look at services paying or rewarding users creating massive pattern of ratings in a matter of hours.<p>For the record we created for our quality index (App score) a system that detects abnormal rating patterns. We know a little about that. <a href=""http://blog.appsfire.com/introducing-the-appsfire-app-score-the-ultimate-quality-score-for-mobile-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.appsfire.com/introducing-the-appsfire-app-score-...</a><p>App booster is an user friendly, developer friendly way to re-establish what the app store has never offered: a direct dialog channel with the user and a smart feedback system to treat efficiently bad and good feedback.<p>Let me know if you have more questions<p>PS: We actually showed our system to some people at Apple who actually reacted very positively to the initiative.",1337613143

In some cases, this means maintaining a flat stock price but paying healthy dividends (in other words, giving some of the profits to the shareholders). This was actually the dominant model for many years (link below, take a look at the growth rate during the '70s and '80s).<p>The somewhat more recent trend toward increasing share prices is just another way of maximizing shareholder value. In this case, it is done by increasing the market value of the stock being held by the shareholders.<p>It is quite common for companies today to pay no dividends. Since the shareholders don't get a piece of the profits, the only way to make money on the stock is to buy low and sell high (or buy low and hold for awhile, perhaps until retirement, and then sell, however you want to look at it).<p>So there really isn't any intrinsic reason for a company to seek a higher stock price. The point is to maximize <i>value</i>, which doesn't always equate to price.<p>Of course that isn't going to cheer up people who hoped to buy FB on Friday and flip it for a huge profit this week after the ""bump"".

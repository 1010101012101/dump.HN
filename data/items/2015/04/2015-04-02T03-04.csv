Does apple &#x27;monetize&#x27; JIT manufacturing as a &#x27;channel&#x27;?<p>Yes, keeping their stock pool as low as it does has real financial benefits associated with it. Cook&#x27;s entire empire at Apple was built on the back of his prowess at streamlining this, such is the value of it to the business. In that sense, they certainly did monetise their skills in JIT manufacture.<p>I&#x27;d argue they also did monetise the direct sales aspect, since the whole &#x27;Apple Store&#x27; experience is presumably of net financial gain to them, or else they wouldn&#x27;t do it.",1427947159

9308581,comment,9307685,9308496,0,0,kibwen,,,"It&#x27;s certainly a fascinating piece of tech and a very politically intriguing play by Google, but I don&#x27;t see it suddenly changing the calculus of app development. Here&#x27;s why: the set of apps that I run on my phone are disjoint from the set of apps that I run on my laptop or desktop. My laptop doesn&#x27;t need a flashlight, or turn-by-turn navigation, or the ability to hail a cab, because I don&#x27;t have it out or open or even with me when I do the things that need these apps. My phone doesn&#x27;t need Photoshop or Notepad++ because the form factor doesn&#x27;t favor it. Write-once-run-everywhere isn&#x27;t a selling point for your app because I don&#x27;t actually want to run it everywhere.<p>The one exception could be games, which are a lucrative market. That said, mobile games will offer a limited set of interactions compared to typical PC offerings, which will limit appeal to people who are already playing mobile games but who wish to play those games on their desktop as well. It will increase time spent in the app, but not grow the market substantially relative to new users coming in from mobile devices. And because it requires a browser anyway and because ARC is never going to run on iOS, if the web can advance fast enough to keep the market satisfied (asm.js is a start, but <i>payment</i> is still horribly lacking) then there will be pressure to just do everything on the web anyway.<p>Interesting times are in store, regardless.",1427946759

9308574,comment,9306036,9306877,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"> But do we really think that inadequate incentive to create new drugs or new movies is a major problem right now?<p>I found this line in Krugman&#x27;s text surprising, because there actually are a lot of questions about incentives in both drug and entertainment markets.<p>In drugs, pharma companies are focusing on high-margin &quot;lifestyle enhancing&quot; drug categories like erectile dysfunction, blood pressure management, and various mood and mental management. Basically, the drugs that rich healthy people will pay a lot of money for. Pharma companies are not focusing on low-margin but highly useful categories like antibiotics, pests, and vaccines. Basically, the problems that affect poor people in 2nd and 3rd world countries.<p>In entertainment, companies are focusing on iterating well-known and well-used franchises for which they know they can drive immediate demand with marketing. Highly original hits like <i>Inception</i> are not nearly as common as they were in say, the 1970s or 1980s. Instead we get <i>Furious 7</i> and a two remakes of <i>21 Jump Street.</i><p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the drug and entertainment industries are making a lot of money. But the issue is how they are making it. Drug companies stick to first world problems because first world countries protect their IP, so that is where they&#x27;ll get a return. Entertainment companies stick to movies that will pack the theater on opening weekend because the movie will be heavily pirated within a few days after that.<p>I&#x27;m not crying for the poor drug or movie executives. I&#x27;m saying that the rest of us have to live with the consequences of how we incentivize companies to do business.<p>edit: word fixes",1427946645

9308568,comment,9307624,9308491,0,0,vacri,,,"The water cycle has a net loss of 0, but only on a global scale. Water that is expired by a tree and ends up as vapour in the air does not precipitate straight out again, unless the air is already completely saturated (ie: it&#x27;s already raining/snowing). That water will indeed come down again... somewhere.<p>In general, something needs to change for the water vapour to turn into rain, like changing altitude from passing over a mountain (reducing temperature and pressure), or the air stream combining with a colder one. Deserts tend to be flat and featureless, so there&#x27;s little in the way of atmospheric change as you pass through them.<p>An interesting example of this is the continent of Australia - the most populated part is on a thin strip on the east coast as that&#x27;s where the water and hence arable land is. But the air moves across the continent from the west - in general, the air crosses an entire continent before giving up it&#x27;s water. It gives up that water because it hits the long strip of mountains slightly inland from the east coast, which changes the conditions appropriately. But until it hits those mountains, the entire overland journey is very consistent for the vapour, so it stays as vapour. There are several mechanisms at play here in dumping the water from vapour into rain - check out wikipedia, I couldn&#x27;t do them all justice.",1427946562

9308563,comment,9304541,9305294,0,0,timv,,,"This is covered in a little more details in other comments [1] but the basic idea is:<p>- The user generates a password. That password can be assumed to have relatively low <i>randomness</i> (entropy). It&#x27;s normally going to be 6-12 ascii characters which isn&#x27;t a particularly large input space. Expecting users to remember something substantially larger is not realistic.<p>- Because the input space is so small, good password hashing solutions need to have a high work factor, so that is it computationally infeasible to do a dictionary attack on the database.<p>- If the input space was larger [but everything else stayed the same] then we could reduce the work factor, because the size of the dictionary would increase, automatically making dictionary attacks harder to do.<p>- That &quot;everything else stayed the same&quot; is important. We still need our hash to be one-way, but it means (in overly simple terms) if we increase our input space by 1000 times, then we can decrease our work factor by the same magnitude.<p>- If you can increase the input space enough, then eventually you get to the point where a standard hash like SHA2 has a high enough &quot;work factor&quot; (CPU/GPU load)<p>And the missing piece is that it is argued (and is potentially true, but I haven&#x27;t done the analysis, so don&#x27;t take this as a recommendation or endorsement) that scrypt (used appropriately, with random salting) is an effective means of converting that small input space into a larger one.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9305504"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9305504</a>",1427946390

Small changes had to be done to accommodate some yet to be supported APIs. No big deal though. The performance is good. Even on the low end chromebook I test with. Myonly concern is related to how the (my) codebase might need to evolve over time to adapt to ARC updates. Right now it&#x27;s pretty sane with only a handful of extra settings on the manifest file. But I worry about being forced into forking. Having two similar but slightly different codebase for the same app is silly.<p>The overall experience with the Google team has been very positive.

The way the ARC team has gone above and beyond to help has been refreshing.<p>I do worry as to how this would affect the openness of the web. A closed source container used to run other closed sourced clients is not my idea of how the Web should be. Even Mozilla is going down this route with their browser apps.

But now they will target Android for the same reason because it can run on Windows, Mac, ChromeOS and Android smartphones.<p>This &quot;Android First&quot; model will affect several major areas, all in Google&#x27;s favour:<p>1. It strengthens ChromeOS over Windows.<p>ChromeOS is already a strong player in the education and low-price sectors.  Having a huge range of Android apps will make ChromeOS far more attractive and grow its market share.  Moreover if corporate, boring-office-CRUD developers switch to an Android-first model then it will very quickly kill Windows.<p>2. It strengthens Chrome over Firefox and IE.<p>Many apps will now <i>require</i> the Chrome browser to run. Oh, you are running Firefox on Windows and want to play that cool Android game your friend told you about?  Just switch to Chrome and sign in with your Google account!  Again there are network effects - the greater Chrome&#x27;s market share the more willing developers are to create Chrome-only apps.<p>3. It strengthens Android over iOS.<p>Android has about 85% of smartphone market share, but many startups are still undecided about an Android-first approach because a single Apple user generates far more revenue than a single Android user.  Having Android run on desktops will push some startups off the fence in favour of Android-first.  A few developers switching from iOS to Android doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but if there are a ever a critical mass of Android-only apps it will quickly kill iOS.  Apple should be worried.<p>4. It strengthens Native over Web-app development.<p>Ok this isn&#x27;t a huge benefit for Google, but it is significant for developers.  Back in 2005 every startup chose browser-based web apps as their target platform.  The rise of smartphones has pushed the pendulum back towards native development, but desktops have remained the preserve of web apps.  Many startups now develop both a Web App and Android version of their product - by dumping Web App development startups will now be able to (a) save costs; (b) produce a desktop app that has native performance and better access to Google Play Services.",1427945147

It&#x27;ll make for a good story to tell at parties later, sure, but it could also not end well. While you claim CS knowledge, I don&#x27;t see a link to your Github or Bitbucket in your profile, and I&#x27;m going to bet that you aren&#x27;t going to reliably find work if you need it in short order.

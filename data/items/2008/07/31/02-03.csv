I'd have called 37 Signals a startup (still might, when does being a startup end--I don't know how to draw the line).<p>I worked at a software company which has 5 buildings it owns outright, employs thousands of people, and has 300 million+ in annual revenue.

262594,comment,262341,262416,0,0,a-priori,,,"That paragraph in the article really got on my nerves, because the whole idea of a ""set point"" for weight is wrong. There is no set point for weight. The only reason people think there is one is because it's a nice, neat hypothesis. Unfortunately, it is directly contradicted by evidence.<p>Your body does not try to return to a some weight, but rather resists changes in weight. Given constant diet and exercise, weight will asymptotically settle at some value and stay there. Make a significant change to diet and/or exercise, and the asymptote changes accordingly.",1217472141

If we want to change to 100% green tech in 20 years it may be a good idea to postpone most investments in green infrastructure 5 years and focus on research.  Think in terms of a render farm if you buy 100k in PC's now and calculate for 5 years you generate a result. But by waiting one year to start and then buing 100k in PC's you will finish sooner and have a more valuable render farm.",1217471964

10057429,comment,10056593,10056593,0,0,kybernetyk,,,"I have something to add about the missing incentive for developers to update their apps in the app store:<p>The MAS actually penalizes you if you update an app which has a bunch of good reviews. Because after you publish a new update the average rating that is shown next to your app in the search results/category lists disappears until you get at least 5 new reviews for the current version.<p>Now this was introduced to the app store(s) because iOS developers bemoaned that they couldn&#x27;t get rid of bad average ratings when they published a well-received update.<p>So Apple changed from displaying an average rating of all version to displaying just the average rating for the current version. With the requirement of at least 5 ratings to display any average at all.<p>On iOS this might work because the volume there is large. But on the Mac App Store it takes months for an average application (read: one that is not permanently featured by Apple) to acquire said 5 ratings.<p>So you think twice about pushing out an update to your app when the current average rating is 4 or 5 stars. Because once your average stars are gone, your app doesn&#x27;t look very different from any other 0 rating app in the search results and it&#x27;s pure luck if the user likes your icon enough to click on it. (Which measurably impacts sales numbers).<p>I see this with my own software: I currently have an app in the MAS which has an average rating of 4.5 stars and hasn&#x27;t been updated since June 2014. Because I once made the mistake to update a well rated app and sales plummeted over the next few months until the app could re-acquire 5 ratings to show an average. So I&#x27;m not going to push an update of the app to the MAS anytime soon. And if a user complains I send them to the direct download version (which got several big updates during the last year).

You&#x27;re going to make yourself work on something for that 5 minutes, after which you can bail if you&#x27;re bored or dislike it. 9/10 times you&#x27;ll continue through until you finish (yay hyperfocus). If you do bail, take a break for half an hour and then take another run at either that task or a different one.<p>That technique is actually really useful for getting started on stuff. It combats the bit where you can&#x27;t estimate your own tasks very well so everything looks huge before you begin it. Also combats the bit where you&#x27;re sure you can wait until the last minute, but get caught out because, again, you can&#x27;t estimate well.<p>I&#x27;ve also found Getting Things Done to work well for me, or its simpler variant, Zen to Done. There&#x27;s also Personal Kanban, handful of other methods. Just don&#x27;t get too caught up in the methodology itself at the expense of doing actual work, and maybe give a try to simple task lists first.<p>Whichever way you track it, first thing in the day, write down stuff you&#x27;re going to do. Make sure at least one thing is actually a useful thing to be doing so that you&#x27;re always moving forward. Then do those. At the end of the day, make sure you review so you know what you did and didn&#x27;t do. And write down stuff you didn&#x27;t plan for that you did anyway--you deserve the credit!<p>If you don&#x27;t get all the planned stuff done, make your list smaller the next day--you either have an estimation problem around not knowing your unplanned work, or you&#x27;re just fooling yourself as to your velocity. Even if you eventually end up with a task &quot;list&quot; of one (remember, useful!) task per day, you&#x27;re still moving forward. Once you know how to move forward at all, you can start making incremental improvements towards moving forward two tasks, three tasks, etc.<p>That approach works pretty well in objective-based jobs like coding, where it&#x27;s usually ok to have some uneven speed for awhile as long as you don&#x27;t fully stall and as long as you eventually ramp up. My experience is that, deadlines be damned, most people who care about your output are considerably more worried about you being reliable and honest about your velocity than the velocity itself. The latter can always be improved as long as the former is there.<p>Edit: also watch sleep, diet, exercise, get meds, etc. But none of those change bad study/work habits learned before you get things under control physically. The above addresses those.",1439501479

(also also, agency models are closely tied to union models which freaks out tech employers.) Employees aren&#x27;t supposed to be job hopping every 3 months.  Sure, job hopping happens, but you should eventually reach <i>some</i> steady state where you&#x27;re not moving every 9 months.  Retaining a personal agent to do nothing after you get stable and are employed for 4 years is a waste.<p>The current drive-by-recruiter model exists because developers are valuable and companies don&#x27;t know how to find them on their own.<p>The entire developer+job problem is a classic information asymmetry issue.  If all companies registered their open jobs publicly at a centralized site (then if the same site knew all available developers and their skills) then the site could match available developers to openings [modulo culture fit, relocations, aggressive salary negotiations, etc].  Maybe it could even stabilize salaries so we correct the pay rates.  A lot of developers generate in excess of $5 million in value every year yet get paid 1/40th to 1/30th of their productive output.<p>Basically we need a non-evil version of LinkedIn combined with Angel List combined with Indeed.  Jobs would have to be better specified (no 10 years nodejs required!!!) and people would need to be better specified (not &#x27;recommendations&#x27; or &#x27;credentialing&#x27; — perhaps trust-but-verify).

Bucket the net volume audio levels across quarter-second intervals. Fuzzy match a bit. If the levels have some change in them, and the changes match, you&#x27;re in. Virtually no useful information in that signature.<p>By contrast, if you get &quot;clever&quot;, and want to go with that basic approach, but you want more bits to fuzzy match, so you break apart the frequency bands into 64 bands and sample on 50 millisecond intervals, and you&#x27;re getting perilously close to revealing speech in the signature with enough processing.

I don&#x27;t expect either of those would &quot;work&quot; on their own; I kept them simple to describe and simple to understand for the purposes of this post. The point is the info leak on the signature can vary quite widely depending on how they do it, and without knowing the algorithm you can&#x27;t speculate very effectively.

For the record the Thumbor cluster I was working on needed to have 100% uptime and be configured to mitigate any potentially DDoS situation even if the secret key was leaked. It also needed facial detection and GIF (animation) resizing support.<p>The tmp directory is never emptied unless you restart the machine. So to get around this you have to write a cron job to remove the older downloaded and resized images. However in my load tests this caused issues with Thumbor and so I ended up having the cron job only delete files over a certain age. However this still leaves the possibility that Thumbor could fill up the entire disk and crash the machine.<p>Other issues were having the ability to rotate the Thumbor key. This is somewhat supported by Thumbor, in that the previous keys images will still be available but the key rotation is not done for you. I was using AWS so stored the key in a protected s3 bucket and gave roles access to pull the key and when it detected it was modified restart Thumbor.<p>The last an main issue was the ability to spin up a new version of Thumbor itself. In the time it took me to get it from development through to production the dependancies changed so much that facial detection broke halfway though. I fixed this initially by freezing the pip dependancies but then the underlying dependancies caused issue at a later day. In short I was unable to spin up a new version which was identical to the previous. Generally were I work we tear down and spin up fresh instances all the time so this was an issue. We resolved this by installing Thumbor in a docker container.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong.

This is far from the biggest problem though.<p>There are entire classes of applications that you can&#x27;t find in the Mac App Store even when they&#x27;re free (like web browsers!) so it&#x27;s not just money that is keeping them away.  Worse, apps that &quot;add on&quot; to popular products <i>do</i> make it in, creating this weird situation where you search for $POPULAR_THING and you don&#x27;t find $POPULAR_THING but you <i>do</i> find all kinds of &quot;99 cent plug-in for $POPULAR_THING&quot; products.  It really serves to clutter up and lower the perceived value of the entire store.<p>Apple should be treating this as <i>the</i> way to find and install Mac software, and lower every single wall if necessary until the likes of Mozilla, Google, Microsoft and Adobe are <i>all</i> on board with that.<p>If price is the issue, remind big developers that there are costs to running an app store but negotiate with them until they are willing.  For the good of the platform.<p>If the sandbox is the sticking point (as it is perhaps for Firefox and Chrome), one option is to add an &quot;Advanced Install&quot; button so that all software can still be <i>available</i> on the App Store even if there is an extra hurdle.  Apple could still set strict sandbox requirements for default installs.  [The sandbox is one reason I didn&#x27;t submit my terminal app because I cannot find any reasonable default sandbox that wouldn&#x27;t utterly cripple shells and other common sub-processes.]<p>Licensing should <i>certainly</i> not be an issue.  The fact is, there is a ton of really important free software on the Mac and some of it is GPL.  Apple may not like this but they cannot deny that the value of their entire platform <i>has grown</i> because of such software.  They should add an option to bundle or link source code with App Store entries.  And if they really can&#x27;t bring themselves to do that, the very least they should allow is an official <i>entry</i> for every piece of software, even if that entry is only allowed to link to an external web site for licensing reasons.",1439499670

Rather, &quot;sets requirements for state driver&#x27;s licenses and ID cards to be accepted by the federal government for &#x27;official purposes&#x27;&quot;. Also the mandated IDs for &#x27;voter fraud&#x27; were largely a political ploy to prevent certain people from voting, not to collect information.<p>Maybe take off the tinfoil once in awhile.",1439499612

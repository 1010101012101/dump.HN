A lot of the gain from your experience, I think, was probably from having good instructors trained in how to teach students with those particular disabilities, and probably a good teacher-to-student ratio. If we were willing to pay public teachers more, public schools could attract the same experts, and if we were willing to employ more public teachers in total, we could achieve a similar ratio.

8689420,comment,8687804,8687804,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"The issues tech companies have with immigration are about costs. The argument that is about &quot;talent&quot; that the AeroFS blog post makes is <i>not</i> about talent distinct from cost, its about AeroFS&#x27;s preference to not bear the cost (including time, financial cost, and risk) of developing talent to a particular experience level and their preference to have that done for them, and the fact that they found someone for whom that was done in a way they liked and that -- except inconveniently situated with regard to immigration.<p>If we were honest that the issues in immigration (on both sides) <i>are</i> about costs (except for those that are about outright racism), then we could address them more effectively.<p>There is a fairly direct value to immigrants and to certain others (e.g., in the case of those with pre-arranged employment, as would have been the case for the worker AeroFS write about, to their employers) of admitting specific immigrants. There are also social costs and benefits of admitting immigrants. (This also applies to non-immigrant visas, includingthe H-1B, which are, in a sense, peripheral to the issue of immigration, though its mostly what the tech industry is focussing on when discussing &quot;immigration&quot;, which is one of many disconnects between the tech industry and the wider society.)<p>The basic structure of our immigration system -- in terms of the various immigration major categories and the decisions about which of them are unlimited and which are limited by quotas -- represents a judgement about the balancing of the social costs and benefits. Without challenging that basic judgement, there are sensible reforms that could be made which make the system better for everyone. The simplest that I see is to eliminate <i>all</i> the hard quotas in the family-based immigrant visa categories, and simply decide, in each category, on a fee to be assessed for supernumerary (above the now-soft quota) immigrants. (Generally, this should follow the structure of the family preference categories, with the more distant relation categories having higher fees.)<p>Instead of changing the structure of employer-sponsored immigrant visa categories, and to address some of the non-immigrant economic visa categories (particularly H-1B), what I&#x27;d strongly suggest is creating a separate no-quota (that is, all fee-based) individual immigrant visa category for candidates who are neither barred from immigrating to the US nor qualified in any of the existing family preference categories, with the highest fees, and allow economic entrants for work that is neither seasonal nor short-term to use that (and eliminate the non-treaty based non-immigrant visa classifications that this provision replaces, particularly the H-1B), while keeping the existing quota-restricted employer-sponsored immigrant visa categories.<p>If a company wants to give an employee an payment (up-front or in arrears) to cover the fee as a supernumerary immigrant (in either a family preference class or the new open class), they could through a relationship governed under contract law, but they&#x27;d get no special position with respect to the employee under immigration law.<p>This would address any &quot;talent&quot; issue that isn&#x27;t about cost that the tech industry has with H-1B limits (or that industry in general has with the limits in employer-sponsored immigrant visa categories), address those issues that <i>are</i> about costs by providing a direct mechanism by which the social cost of the cost savings to industry are internalized in the transaction, address the problems with hard quotas that cause real problems in the family preference categories which are both drivers of illegal immigration <i>and</i> undermine the entire purpose of family-centered immigration policy, and provide funds to address the social costs associated with the overall <i>level</i> of immigration.",1417550107

You can reallocate your units into different RIs, so if you bought a c3.2xlarge and want to upgrade it to a 4x large, you&#x27;d just buy a second 2xlarge and then recombine your two 2xlarges into a 4xlarge. Or you could split a 32-unit 4xlarge into 4 8-unit 1x larges.<p>ie, 2x c3.xlarge (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/hPl2WNJ.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/hPl2WNJ.png</a>) recombine into 1x c3.2xlarge (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/KhthjYo.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/KhthjYo.png</a>)<p>Granted, you can&#x27;t jump from a medium to a large; it only works within the same product class. But it does provide upgrade paths. It is bass-ackwards, though. And the fact that they sell &quot;instances&quot; rather than &quot;units&quot; but don&#x27;t let you bind RIs to actual instances is confusing as all get-out.",1417549893

This is in contradistinction to most objects which are either Pure Being (present-at-hand) or Process Being (ready-to-hand). Hyper Being objects are defined by Derrida in terms of differing and deferring, but we can talk about instead decoherence and delocalization of Software. Delocalization has to do with the fact that design elements are spread out within programs and in spite of object oriented design are not self-contained at the program level. Decoherence has to do with the fact that programs lack internal coherence intrinsically due to the nature of general purpose programming languages and their multi-paradigm nature and the solution to this is aspect oriented programming which attempts to render coherent elements that are non-localizable. But neither aspect oriented programming nor object oriented programming completely solve the problem of the intrinsic quantum like properties that occur in software. Software designs are like classical physics in relation to the quantum like nature of software. See my original paper on this called Software Ontology at <a href=""http://kp0.me/SoftOntos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kp0.me/SoftOntos</a>. There are in fact various ontological levels identified in Continental Philosophy and beyond Hyper Being is Wild Being and Ultra Being which both have implications for our understanding of Software.<p>Also I don&#x27;t see any reference to Fast and Slow Thinking by  Daniel Kahneman. There is some basis for understanding the difference between Fast Thinking and Slow Thinking in his work. Fast Thinking makes up narratives on the fly while Slow Thinking creates arguments more ponderously. Actually in Software Craftsmanship we need both and we need to balance these two forces in the patterning of our development processes.<p>Kent Palmer <a href=""http://kdp.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kdp.me</a>",1417549879

But just as &quot;agility&quot; and &quot;speed&quot; are not the same, agile development does not necessitate a race to the finish and similarly is not the antithesis of the slow programming style (as some commenters seem to be suggesting).<p>I think people have wrongly used agile as an excuse to implement first, reflect later, refactor never. In the original agile movement, there is a lot of time devoted to refactoring. You hack something together that accomplishes your goal. You get to see how it&#x27;s working, get user testing up and running, and then reflect. But underneath the hood the program is a complete mess. This is the time for an agile developer to go back and majorly refactor the program into a neat, well-organized system. Maybe even rewrite. The problem is people on the business side of things see a near-complete project that they want to launch ASAP. It may even feel that way to the developers. I think the refactor part of the process gets cut short because of the desire to push the product out the door or work on new feature sets. You&#x27;re only doing half the agile process in this case.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not in the &quot;plan first, build later&quot; vein of thought. It&#x27;s not how I program or do artwork (I&#x27;m a hobby artist as well). I need time to play around and experiment with different ideas in real-life implementations before settling on my plan of attack. There are so many ideas that may seem great in your head, but don&#x27;t do well IRL. Additionally, you may stumble upon a new idea in the process of experimenting.<p>The thing I long for the most as a programmer is more time to refactor. Time to refine my code. There is something to be said about craftsmanship as opposed to mere production. One thing I&#x27;ve enjoyed about my own personal programming projects outside of work is that I have time to sit back and reflect. Is this the best way of modeling X? Is there a more simple way of expressing X? And then I can do major refactors/rewrites that would never fit into a sprint at my workplace. But I do believe the investment will pay off in the future when it comes to maintenance. And extra day refactoring now could save weeks of debugging later on.",1417549454

That being said, both you and the anon person you replied to are right about the situation.<p>The position you came to fill is a relatively rare skill here in the US and it helps the US to bring in talent from abroad, but the person you replied to isn&#x27;t wrong. It&#x27;s not like compiler engineers don&#x27;t exist in the US. They most certainly do and they most certainly would make more money if you couldn&#x27;t get compiler people from abroad.<p>Personally, I would love it if we were far more liberal with giving out H1-B visas, but also required companies to pay those H1-B visa holders a premium over local talent. i.e. if the market rate is foo, then you need to pay 1.5x foo salary to bring that person from abroad. This would ensure that companies actually can get access to all the talent they need irrespective of origin, but that the talent that comes from abroad doesn&#x27;t depress salaries.<p>1.5x foo is friggin&#x27; cheap if the alternatively is not having the talent at all. It also forces you to always consider domestic labor first if it exists instead of abusing the H1-B visa program to get cheap labor like many companies do.<p>Such a system would also serve to help salaries rise to the levels enjoyed by doctors and lawyers (which is really where salaries should be for any solid engineer). If this means certain business models are no longer viable, then c&#x27;est la vie. There&#x27;s nothing that says that you have a right to a business model that wouldn&#x27;t exist if salaries were not depressed.<p>Alternatively, I would be okay with eliminating the lottery and giving visas out on the basis of the premium companies are willing to pay over the salary a domestic worker would be paid. If your company is willing to pay 2.0x foo for a position, then you will get the H1-B visa ahead of a company only willing to pay 1.5x foo. The floor would be set at something like 1.1x foo.",1417549129

One reads from the floppy into a ring buffer and the other reads from the buffer and drives the audio and video.  A few tracks are read to prime the buffer before the display thread runs in earnest.<p>The glitches you see are when a byte is dropped when reading a disk track.  This causes the display to shift by a column and the interleaved audio data is displayed as graphics.  And, conversely, one of the graphics columns is played as audio causing the screeching.<p>Some runs work better than others.  The byte drops could be due to slight motor speed variance.  Or just down to luck -- a few of the disk operations incur wait states as does writing to video memory.  These times vary depending on exactly when they occur so it could just be down to luck.  The code works in fixed 128 cycle steps with a few cycles reserved for wait state issues but apparently not enough to ensure correct operation.<p>And what about when the screen completely fills with garbage?  I&#x27;ve no idea.  Maybe the track didn&#x27;t write correctly.  Or maybe the drive misses a bit.  Shifting the graphics and audio data stream by a bit would surely scramble the graphics.

Primarily, the reason to send humans is because we have to in order to ensure the continued survival of (known) life in the universe. Sending a few people to Mars will be the first steps in becoming a multi-planetary civilization, which will reduce our dependency on a single-point-of-failure for all known life.<p>> Why not robots?<p>You ask as if we haven&#x27;t been sending robots to Mars for the last 3-4 decades. (Edit: We should absolutely send robots. We should send way more robots than people. But we should still send people.)<p>> Is it worth risking a human&#x27;s life for science, when a robot can do an equally good job?<p>Not sure if trolling. Humans have collectively agreed that it&#x27;s worth 10,000+ annual deaths in the USA in exchange for the convenience of cars. So yes, 1-5 human lives on Mars is worth the science that they&#x27;d get done.<p>Also...there are no robot scientists yet. Maybe there will be in the future, but we can&#x27;t bank on that and allocate budgets to imaginary robotic scientists that are better than humans.<p>I&#x27;ve been trolled haven&#x27;t I?",1417548342

I think that part of the appeal of the H1B is that it creates a pool of programmers who are only allowed to be programmers.  Keep in mind, the biggest competition for programmers may come from outside the field.  In my opinion, being a programmer is actually very difficult.  Even the much derided &quot;crud&quot; apps require a substantial amount of reading of dense material, tremendous persistence in the face of strange and obscure bugs and errors, the ability to communicate with (and negotiate with) non-technical stakeholders under deadline pressure… really, people who can do this are able to take jobs that often pay better with more stability in other fields, provided that they are free to do so.<p>For instance, registered nurses and dental hygienists in the bay area earn a bit more and a bit less than application developers, respectively.  Under the H1B terms, it would be difficult for a programmer to become a physician, lawyer, nurse, dental hygienist, mortgage broker, or many other jobs.  As a result a salary and prospects gap can emerge between programming and these fields - increasing the probability that those people with freedom and choice will avoid programming (and ensuring that the &quot;shortage&quot; continues decade after decade).<p>Truth is, visa programs that are designed to target specific jobs or industries by allowing workers only to work for a specific employer or in a specific field are likely to end up badly distorting labor markets.",1417547951

Thy&#x27;ve also <i>tripled</i> in-state tuition in that time. And since 2008, managers and executives have been the fastest growing segment of the UC workforce. In other words, they&#x27;re each doing less with more.<p>So yes, bad. And it gets even worse when you consider the socio-economic status of the people who are being expected to pay for the mushrooming admin layer. &quot;Looting&quot; is the expression that comes to mind. Only here, the people on top are stealing people&#x27;s future earnings, as opposed to money they&#x27;ve already made. Moreover, they&#x27;re forcing their victims to underwrite this unjust enrichment by making career choices that prioritize payment on egregiously inflated short-term notes over the kinds of decisions that may be in the long-term interests of students and society alike (e.g., a risky start-up with a long pre-growth lead).<p>And yes, &quot;forcing&quot; is a fair choice of words. The gun being pointed at their victims&#x27; heads is the very real threat of chronic instability (at best) if not outright poverty, which is a depressingly likely outcome for those who forego a college degree. And given the cratering value of degrees from cheaper but lower tier schools is no panacea.<p>Worth remembering: UC is not (on paper) a profit-making venture. It is an institution devoted (in theory) to public service.<p>p.s. UC admins can retire and start collecting pensions at at 55 or at 50, if they were hired before 2013. Added bonus: UC carved out an exception to the state&#x27;s $110/yr cap on pensions. Depending on your salary, you may be eligible for $250k/year for life. Conceivably, this can go on for 40 years, which would mean &quot;earning&quot; $10 million for...breathing.<p>Presently, UC is spending $1.3 <i>billion</i> per year on pensions, and have been since 2010, when the state of CA stopped covering the full cost of employer contributions to UC&#x27;s outrageous pension plans.<p>These fun facts are via Anthony York, formerly of the LA Times.

I run a small, one man, UK Limited company and was for a time VAT registered. This is because when I first started the company I spent a few thousand Pounds on equipment. All the VAT I paid on this equipment was able to be offset against any VAT I collected through invoicing. For a while I was ahead and it helped my cash flow, even factoring in the accountancy bills each quarter (which weren&#x27;t really all that much). I made this move on advice from my accountant, and at the appropriate time, when I was no longer &quot;ahead&quot; on VAT, I was advised to de-register for VAT.

It doesn&#x27;t exist. When a company claims they can&#x27;t find a US worker they are lying and going through &#x27;recruitment efforts&#x27; for Green Card and I-140 applications. \nHR uses a list of skills from the H1B they wanted to hire and then tailor a job posting to that exact list of skills in order to disqualify local applicants. By claiming they can&#x27;t find a US worker they can bring in their wage slave who will be an indentured servant. They will use that person&#x27;s visa and green card as a carrot to wave in front of their face to make them go along with violating labor laws. &quot;Someday you&#x27;ll be a US citizen if you just put up with this for a little bit more!&quot; They string this out into a decade long process often. Oracle and Yahoo were the worst offenders. Anyone who is &#x27;pro-immigration&#x27; is just an unknowing tool for multi-billion dollar conglomerates. Immigration has been turned into a public subsidy for the richest corporations.<p>Then you have outsourcing companies like Cognizant regularly scooping up 50% of the H-1b lottery: <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/article/2489146/technology-law-regulation-offshore-firms-took-50-of-h-1b-visas-in-2013.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/article/2489146/technology-law-...</a><p>It&#x27;s pretty disingenuous to claim there isn&#x27;t a US worker, the companies have no intent to hire an American. Their entire business model is built around outsourcing the work.\nNow if you want to talk to me about legalizing farm workers I have no problem with that. I think it&#x27;s pretty disgusting we have this shadow economy built on third class workers that we all benefit from and know exists. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t have the tech industry lobbying for them like the H-1B holders do.

How many Americans are going to work abroad in India? How many Canadians are going to work in China? It&#x27;s feel-good rhetoric but ultimately it&#x27;s just an excuse to flood richer nations with workers from poorer nations. I&#x27;d be all for this system if there was some kind of tit-for-tat program where India gets as many visas given to them as they give to us proportionally--but it will never happen. If STEM and engineers are so in demand why have their wages stagnated? Why has the average income actually dropped in Silicon Valley?

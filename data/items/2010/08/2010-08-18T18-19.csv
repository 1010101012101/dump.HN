We wanted to tear down these barriers and make opening a shop quick, free and easy.<p>We've developed simple shopping software which anyone can use to be up and running selling physical and digital products online in minutes.
The software is completely decentralised and customisable so sellers can theme their shops as they please and have them on their own domains. The software is also socially integrated so you can push your shop to a tab on Facebook/easily leverage twitter to get the word out about it.<p>During the customer development stage it was made clear to us that apart from the tech side of things, driving traffic and generating sellers was an equally important problem which first time/small sellers had to deal with - to solve this we've networked all the shops together creating a centralised marketplace.<p>Buyers can quickly and easily search across all shops in our network. The marketplace helps buyers find products and helps sellers generate traffic.<p>To make buying from a shoply seller even easier we've networked buyers shopping carts together across all shops. Buyers can hop from shop to shop across different domains adding products as they go - when they're ready then can checkout in one quick transaction. All the sellers then get their share of the sale in real-time directly to their paypal account.<p>Our software is built using django and we've utilised Paypal's new Adaptive payment API to facilitate one-to-many real-time transactions.<p>For sellers we are software providers and traffic generators. For buyers we are a discovery engine and marketplace curator.<p>We're not looking to compete with the advanced self-hosted shopping cart companies. We are looking to help first time sellers, individuals and small businesses, get started. Think Tumblr for ecommerce. In terms of disruptive innovation we want to be a new market and low-end disruption.<p>Would love to know what you think.<p>If you have something to sell - why not open your own shop!<p>http://shoply.com",1282157990

And anyway the famous (in those days) techcrunch's tablet was not going to use any PC OS.<p>Anyway, the only point I was replying to was that Apple did have a lot of pressure back in those days to come out with their netbook or with something that covered the same niche, and some people even suggested that Apple should have lost in the tablet market because there were already a few offers around or soon to be.<p>In other words I was not discussion what made the iPad a success (if it deserved it, or any of those more hot topics). Simply that it's not true that Apple was not under pressure to present _something_, which is the point the OP was saying.",1282157982

Over the last 20 years, we've seen <i>massive</i> deflation in the markets for consumer goods.  My first computer, not quite twenty years ago, cost $2500 and was a desktop with a 20 MHz processor and 2 MB of RAM.  I now have a phone worth roughly $400 with a 1 GHz processor and 4 GB SD card.<p>Meanwhile, there's been massive <i>inflation</i> in services, particularly health care and education.  When my mom went to college, a $3000 National Merit Scholarship basically covered a whole year's tuition.  When I went to college, tuition + room & board was roughly $40K/year, and is higher now.<p>People are responding to those price incentives, which is why you see people at the poverty level with blu-ray DVD players, iPhones, and netbooks, but with no health insurance or college education.  Prices for consumer electronics have come down so much that it's worth more to them to spend half a month's salary on a phone that they'll keep for a couple years rather than try to get health insurance that they can't afford anyway.<p>Whether this is a good thing depends on whether you consider phones, computers, and entertainment to be more important than health care and education.",1282157434

1615121,comment,1614051,1614642,0,0,kragen,,,"Dried soybeans are 36% protein by weight. Muscle beef is 32% protein by weight, although other parts of the cow are lower in protein.  A steer is 4% of the soybeans it's fed, by weight.  So feeding soybeans to cattle is even less defensible as a way of providing protein to people than as a way of providing calories to people: you waste 96.5% of the protein that way.<p>The picture is a little less egregiously bad if you look at some other foods (sweet corn is only 3.2% protein, so if you could get your cattle to grow on corn without supplementing their diet with soy or other protein, you'd only be wasting 60% of the protein).  But it still isn't <i>good</i>.<p>The fundamental constraint here is that <i>animals can't produce protein from carbohydrates or fat</i>. Animals can only produce protein from protein. In fact, most plants can't produce protein from carbohydrates or fat or carbon dioxide or water, either. They need to take up nitrogen compounds from the soil to make protein.  As far as we know, animals can't aminate carbohydrates using other sources of nitrogen, the way plants can.  So the protein that comes from your crops is the most protein you can possibly get. Processing it through animals can only <i>reduce</i> the protein yield per acre of crops.<p>The complexity of the proteins in the cow isn't an advantage, either. You have to break those proteins down to individual amino acids before your ribosomes can use them to build proteins of your own. If foreign peptides (protein fragments) get into your bloodstream, your immune system will destroy them. From the standpoint of nutrition, the less complex the proteins are, the better.<p>On the other hand, animal processing can make the protein and calories considerably easier to eat.  Ruminants' symbiotic bacteria can extract useful calories (and massive amounts of methane) from cellulose, even if they only pass 5% of them on to their predators; your body doesn't support these bacteria at all.  And cows have these massive jaws and teeth for grinding up cellulosic material to extract the nutrients from it.<p>So, veganism <i>as a diet</i> (I'm not sure what you mean by ""as a lifestyle""} isn't dependent on ""huge energy subsidies"". It's just dependent on crops you can stand to eat and that provide you adequate nutrition.  Eating animals is a huge cost to your primary productivity; the compensating advantage is that it renders you more adaptable in your crops. Eating animal products is somewhat less of a huge cost.<p>As for freezing, it's fairly unusual for people to heat their homes by burning animals, and in Europe, it was unusual for people to insulate their homes with animals or animal products.  Not freezing is really more a matter of thermodynamic engineering than it is a matter of acquiring adequate energy.  A good thick thatch roof, a couple of meters of straw bales in the walls, and some whitewash on the inside will allow you to heat even a largish habitation with a small fire.  No huge energy subsidies required.  (Please don't start complaining about the embodied energy of the whitewash.)",1282156630

We need help on getting progressive UI and graphic design, but we are in the ramen mode and don’t have enough monies to buy our way through to the design Gods. We want to be ready for TC Disrupt when it happens next (possibly Dec'10) but can’t seem to solve this problem as none of the local design firms are up to the task.<p>What should we do?

How the Times let him write without making it plain that he is a (failed) entrepreneur in an online education scheme, I don't know.<p>First, writers who go on about the how high tuition, but don't investigate how much people actually pay can never be trusted.  The only figures to contemplate are average and median tuition actually payed. The stated tuitions are simply the maximum; it is true that Trustees have spiked the maximum in the last 20 yrs, figuring, why not make Saudi princes pay as much as possible. This is not inflation, but a policy change that affects a vanishing minority of students. Any writer who doesn't make this plain is either stupid or dishonest, and my advice is, stop reading as soon as he or she pulls this stunt.<p>(I realized how much fraud there is in journalism on these themes, when I looked into in-state tuition at my old school, College Park, and was startled to see it is the same, after indexing for inflation, as it was in the late 70's. Admittedly Maryland is a fairly well-heeled state, most state schools have been savaged by legislatures in the last 23 years.)<p>Presumably the Times pays him because they like what he says; clearly there is no fact checker. In one of his earlier [diatribes](<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/7/19/what-if-college-tenure-dies/why-tenure-is-unsustainable-and-indefensible"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/7/19/what-if-colle...</a>) the claim was let pass that the average 'full professor' makes $12,198,578 / 30 = $406,619.26 per annum. He also suggests that it is typical to spend 5 years as an associate professor, then 30 as a full professor. The data on a large state university are before me:  these are the numbers for the humanities faculty:<p><pre><code>    62 full profs at average $99,431  --nice work if you can get it.
    69 assoc profs at avg $64,722
    51 asst profs at avg $53,687

His claim about full professors would suggest that there should be something like six full professors for every associate prof; in fact, there is less than one. (That the number of untenured assistant professors approaches the same figure though this status lasts only ~7 years; this suggests well over half of them will soon be in real estate at age circa 40 -- shows how savage and efficient a market Universities constitute....)<p>For all I know, the Universities should all be drowned at sea, but we'll never know if we are given out and out liars like Prof. Taylor to read.",1282155676

Since then, based on my own reading, I understood that aluminum was really expensive to make due to the high electrical requirements for the process of cracking ores to get the pure aluminum out (a substance that is hard to find in nature in pure form, since it’s readily makes compounds and ores due to its reactivity.) It was this basis that politicians and activists gave to push the first recycling programs here in the States. (Which always, without exception AFAIK, started with aluminum.)<p>My understanding is that glass was phased out in favor of aluminum not due to container creation costs, but storage reasons, since cans take up less room and shelf space than glass and were easier for stock boys and shoppers to carry. (The only eco-reason I came across was increased fuel use to ship glass bottles for the old returnable bottle programs. But this reasoning didn’t make sense to me since I thought shipping a pre-existing container was much cheaper than destroying and making new ones.)<p>Did some technology in recent years dramatically reduce the energy cost of making aluminum?

I do not think it has changed much in the past perhaps five years, much less than search. They looking to copy facebook, or twitter, or everything else and to tell me what I want to eat, but focus on their core products which is search and advertising.<p>So, there is a real opportunity for someone to come up with a much better algorithm than Google's in regard to targeting ads. But then, if you do not have much inventory, you can not really target, and a website owner would rather have an untargeted ad than nothing.<p>So I think the problem of targeted advertising is quite complex. For example, link adsense are targeted well, images not so well because perhaps they are more expensive to make and thus there isn't much of an inventory. Why would an advertiser, but the very few, design an image ad when a one hour to set up link ad might work just as well or better.<p>In any event, people like an image advert when they see it the first time, they might the second, maybe third, but soon they bored of it and start hating it. So changing the ads often is important too.<p>I suppose, to conclude, the issue is much more complex than simply saying that the problem is targeting the ads due to the many variables - which the ad network or publisher can or can not control - that go into targeting the ads well. That might perhaps be why there is not much progress in this area. The internet has basically just copied the model from the traditional world and tried to automate it.<p>It is an undervalued area though.

391361,comment,391235,391235,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>The lack of a class system and an import system means that a lot of libraries reinvent the wheel</i><p>I consider the lack of a class system a feature, not a bug, and Javascript itself one of the most fortunate accidents in computing history.<p>We're really lucky that Brendan Eich happened to have read some SICP and been in a Scheme-enthusiasm phase when he got the job of making a language for the web. Because of this, Javascript contains the messenger RNA of Lisp and Smalltalk and their regular, ultra-dynamic approach to programming - and because of that, it's taking over the world.<p>Of course it's half-baked in some ways, some of which go back to the C-syntax that was politically imposed on it. But we owe the world of web apps, full of incredible creations that go light years beyond anything that the browser was originally designed to do, to the dynamicness and extensibility that did make it into the language. (And that took 10 years for people to begin to figure out.) This recent talk about libraries and language extensions built on top of Javascript is missing one essential point: it's <i>because</i> of its expressiveness that we can build all these interesting abstractions.<p>When you consider how many historical and political accidents have gone <i>against</i> this style of programming, how poorly understood it has been and how nearly everyone thinks that to make things ""serious"" they have to redo it in concrete, we're really very fortunate that even one accident - and one of the biggest - went in our favor.<p>And I do think it was more or less an accident. Lord knows Eich has since spent years trying to turn the thing into Java. To support ""serious development"" don't you know.",1228837611

391325,comment,391288,391288,0,0,swombat,,,"<i>But back to laziness. A great programmer is lazy because he or she prefers thinking through a solution to solve a problem rather than hacking through it, which is way too much effort. Dick Vile, a developer I met at FAME Software, a company founded by Larry Rafsky, put it this way: ""What do I use to do my programming? A pencil."" Thinking things through, coming up with a great design and then doing the coding is the way a real smart, lazy programmer does things.</i><p>The article is interesting on the whole, but this point falls flat on its face, in my humble opinion. Some up-front thinking is always required, but aiming to have the whole thing thought through before you start coding is terribly wasteful - if only because you will always get (sometimes quite important) parts of it wrong because non-trivial systems are too complicated to hold in your head in their entirety while creating a new design.<p>Also, he's only got one third of the picture with laziness. As Larry Wall said, the *three greatest qualities of a programmer are laziness, impatience, and hubris ( <a href=""http://cranked.me/2008/07/laziness-impatience-hubris-three-great.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cranked.me/2008/07/laziness-impatience-hubris-three-g...</a> ).<p>Humility is in direct contradiction with one of them and in indirect contradiction with another. I personally feel that those are still more important qualities than humility when it comes to being a great programmer - which, I hasten to add, is very different from being a great designer... that requires far more humility.",1228835003

It isn't. 10% internet access is more than enough for some biz.  90% is more than enough for most biz.<p>To put it another way/use your own example, the fact that less than 100% of people go to medical school doesn't imply that there aren't enough doctors.<p>Note that ""access"" isn't enough - they have to be willing to use it AND willing to let you get to them via the internet.

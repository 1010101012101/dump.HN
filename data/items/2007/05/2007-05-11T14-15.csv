Occidental people don't understand this huge problem. Arabs and russian people are facing it too. Imagine a web page in english for english people and you have to write an url in asian or arabe script to reach it! Would you be able to remember such url when seen in an advertisement ? The most surprising is that they didn't solved this problem yet. This situation won't last. Yes urls are death ... in the sense PG gave to this concept. <p>The distributed information system (DIS) I am currently working on is planned to solve this. ",1178893981

Paul is far better off sponsoring this as a Firefox improvement (which would be copied by Safari and IE eventually). Even lobbying Adobe to put this in the next Flash release is a better idea. Creating a brand new plugin is a <i>big</i> mistake.<p>",1178893709

21336,comment,21161,21262,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I have some experience with writing in Lisp without good libraries for what I'm doing. It turns out not to be an enormous amount of work to turn an unmaintained unusable FFI to the C library you want into a highly usable, Lispish library. It can at times even be useful for understanding said library. I'm not saying this isn't a drawback of Lisp, but it's also not as huge a barrier as some might think. FFI's have gotten good enough that it doesn't really matter that much what language the library is written in. ",1178892142

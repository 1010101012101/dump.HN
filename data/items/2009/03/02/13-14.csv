And if you've seen enough of the world, you know that this is fair. But when the wealth is taken from the owner, it does not go to the system. It goes to the politicians, who redistribute it to other individuals who did not create the wealth. That's the rub.",1236002346

If you are getting that kind of sustained traffic, then you can likely pay for the conventional hosting.<p>The problem is what happens when you have normal trafic but get spikes? The NY Times links to your startup one morning and suddenly you have hundreds of thousands potential new customers kicking the tires at the same time. You'd like to be able to handle that easily, so you can convert some small % into paying customers and take advantage of the free publicity. But if your site goes down in flames you give a bad first impression to all those potential sales, and they will likely never give you another chance.",1236002111

PG talks a lot about reaching 'ramen profitability' and there's no easier place to hit that than China. It's going to cost me about $400 a month to live (frugally), and if I needed to, I could teach English for about $60 / hr.  Worst case scenario, a native English speaker could dedicate one or two days a month to paying the bills.<p>There is no lack of tech talent in Beijing - from personal work experience, Tsinghua's tech alums are just as bright as MIT's or Stanford's.  And you can hire a fresh graduate for about $20k / year.<p>If you can speak Chinese and you don't want to take external investment, screw Silicon Valley, Beijing is a bootstrapper's paradise.",1236001388

It was a survey, so what exactly were the questions? How were ""those who keep a check on their frustrations"" determined? Lacking that, it's difficult to guess which way causation worked. Were these frustrated people failing because they didn't express anger, or were they more likely to reply that they had unexpressed anger because they were not doing well personally and professionally? Or maybe the causation is that successful people feel more free to express themselves while unsuccessful people don't like to draw attention to themselves.<p>The BBC article on the same study (<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7918622.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7918622.stm</a>) mentioned that ""Outright fury was destructive, the researchers added"", which sounds like an important caveat.

2201630,comment,2200720,2200720,0,0,stcredzero,,,"My read: The piece is based on Anonymous propaganda.  Anonymous itself is actually an amorphous propaganda outfit.  The primary purpose of their actions is to produce media.  Anonymous achieves these ends in part by taking on opponents with good story value, but no consequential power.  They also engage in actions against significant players, like credit card companies, but these actions are most effective in creating media while only resulting in momentary financial damage.  Anon is a media entity, not a financial one.",1297339115

And here is why:<p>Zero points for coming out: Mr Elop was brought in by the board exactly with the goal of rescuing Nokia in mind. Looking from that angle the memo is a bit overdue.<p>Zero points for opening the letter with a metaphor - this is the way someone steering a major technologic corporation is expected to convey the direction - by projecting a vision.<p>Negative ten points for picking wrong metaphor. It broke down immediately. See for yourself: should Mr Elop's best employees take his advice literally and jump the burning platform? Followed with a change in behaviour meaning never again joining a severely fragmented bureaucracy ridden company? What was the lesson learned by the oil rig worker? What could he have done differently in the situation when he woke up on a burning platform in a middle of a sea?<p>I’d award one point for openly enumerating the challenges. But these are the symptoms of Nokia demise, he hasn't dug deep enough, the list is known at this point to every man and his dog.<p>Negative ten for the actual lack of a credible vision at this point. Let’s wait till the strategy comes out.",1297339114

2201573,comment,2201407,2201407,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Because programmers don't ask for more money often enough.<p>Seriously.<p>Here's the three minute version of doing it:<p>1. Work hard on tangible stuff, document and claim credit for doing it, and notify people with <i>what benefit the work provides</i>. This sounds maybe stupidly obvious, but a lot of non-technical people don't understand the value in something. So, ""Upgraded XYZ so our website loads faster, which is proven to make customers more likely to buy according to ZYX paper"" - I know, what a waste of time, right? Wrong! It's going to make you a lot of money. Tell people what you did.<p>2. Before you go to ask for more money, prepare a BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement) - if they say no, what will you do? You need to know this. Having other offers is obviously good. Savings are good. You don't even have to mention your BATNA, but you need a Plan B. Most people don't make one of these, so if their first attempt doesn't go swimmingly, they're in trouble.<p>3. Go in and stress <i>how much more you'd like to do going forwards</i>. This is <i>huge</i>. Do not mention what you've done in the past, except in the context of how it proves how much more you can do going forwards. So go in and say, ""Hi boss, as I mentioned in all my various weekly reports, I've been learning new stuff and kicking massive ass. [that was step one] Recently I've picked up some new skills, and I've been getting recruited for a bunch of projects [step 2], but I really like working here. Actually, I think I can deliver even more value here, if I take on new responsibilities. I'd  like to train a successor to gradually take over my current role, while I do ABC-stimulating-enjoyable-task that will bring the business new money. I don't even want to be compensated much more for it - I'm going to be bringing in lots more value/assets/sales/cash/whatever, but a moderately small raise is enough for me because I like working here so much."" Then lay out what you're asking for.<p>Business people learn how to do this. You're leaving lots of money on the table <i>and</i> not getting a chance to work on cooler stuff that you'd like to do if you don't do this.<p>1. Regularly update with the work you completed, and the benefit it provides.<p>2. Decide what you want, and what you'll do as Plan B if your current company won't give it to you.<p>3. Go stress that you'd be able to <i>produce more value</i> if you transition your role to a more highly paid and enjoyable one. Be friendly and complimentary. Whenever possible, try not to ask for more money for the same role from the same company - people hate price increases, so it's better to expand your role to something that's also more enjoyable and produces more in their eyes. If you want a raise for doing the same exact work, it's probably good to start looking outside the current company as well for other offers.",1297337304

I grab ebooks in my target language, along with their english translations, and I use some open-source software called ""hunalign"" to create a sentence-aligned text.<p>Hunalign is an amazing little piece of software that will figure out which sentences correspond to which other ones in the second text, independent of language. It uses some neat algorithms to find the correspondences using sentence length, and then builds a partial dictionary and rematches.<p>At the end, I get a two-column version of the book, with one language on each side, with sentences matching in each row. As I read in my target language, I can just glance over to the equivalent English on the other side in order to get the meaning.<p>Reading is the fastest way I've found to really get an intuitive sense for the language's grammar and to learn tons of words. And the whole process goes much faster with parallel texts. I learned fluent German through reading, and now I'm working my way through Dutch. I started Dutch in January, and used parallel texts to read through the Harry Potter series while listening to the Dutch audiobook versions of them...now I feel quite ready to jump into non-parallel Dutch novels.<p>More info available on my parallel text process coming soon on my blog: <a href=""http://languagefixation.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://languagefixation.wordpress.com/</a>",1297336205

Health concerns are mostly long-term, and there's no definitive answer on how much getting hit in the head is required for permanent brain damage. Re: concentration, I'm even less convinced; maybe it's not the getting hit that is bad for concentration but the switch between mental/physical activity. Or maybe concentration improves with more adrenaline.""<p>""Yes, for boxing champions, but even there it's hard to say what is caused by the boxing and what is caused by genetic factors. People often say 'look at Ali!' but there's no way to tell if it's really because of the boxing. But more importantly, note that I said 'how much getting hit in the head is required'. See e.g.<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070502093035.ht.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070502093035.ht...</a>.<p><a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/335/7624/809.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/content/335/7624/809.full</a><p>Both from 2007. First one says that amateur boxers do get brain damage, second one says they don't. (there are the top google hits, I looked into this deeper about 5 years ago; at that time there was very little research done, let alone consensus.)<p>Point being, the question is: does getting hit in the head pose linear risks/ I.e, simplified, do a number of cells die for each punch or kick to the head? Or does it require a certain threshold of damage for there to be any cognitive effects?<p>I don't compete in any sport but I've trained plenty of full contact sports over the last 10 or 15 years. I've been punched and kicked in the face a lot, with and without gloves, been knocked out briefly once, been choked out several times. Still my head/brain has taken nowhere near the amount of punishment a pro or even good amateur fighter gets; my brains gets plenty of time between trainings to recover. I can never know for sure if my training has caused brain damage, and if it did, in what form that will manifest itself (or has already, maybe), but I don't have reasons to believe it affected my cognitive functions. Maybe it did and the damage caused decreased intelligence, making me believe that it didn't :)""",1297335817

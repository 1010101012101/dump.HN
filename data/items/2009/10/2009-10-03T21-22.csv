859248,comment,856651,856651,0,0,dstorrs,,,"Last time I did a startup, it was made very clear to me that having IP was effectively a requirement; without it, our chances of getting investment money were enormously lower, and our likely value at M&A or IPO would be lower as well.  In other words, <i>not</i> getting a patent would significantly decrease the chances of success, and the eventual value of the company.<p>So I applied.  The short version of the story:  it was a revolting, morally abhorrent, tedious, timewasting and unbelievably <i>expensive</i> process.  It costs $15,000 to apply for a preliminary patent which offers no protection, but does set the date of your priority.  From the date you file the preliminary patent, you have 1 year to file the all-up version or all rights expire and you can't get them back.  Doing this second version would have cost $50,000.<p>Throughout the application process, the lawyers made very clear that:<p>1) We wouldn't get approved or denied for 4-5 years.<p>2) We wouldn't ever know until the patent was actually granted if someone else had already filed one on it that had priority over ours, because some patents are not visible to a search.<p>3) The patent was going to be useless to us in court, because a) we would not have the money to defend it and b) we had probably invalidated it anyway by discussing the idea in public and/or having a publicly-visible (if unpublished) alpha version available before the patent application was filed.<p>4) Whatever protection it did grant was only in the USA; international protection was an entirely different ball of wax that we'd need to deal with separately, and probably couldn't have gotten or paid for even if we had wanted to.<p>Tell me how this does not describe an utterly broken system that discriminates against small companies?",1254606570

Let's talk rhetoric.<p>The secret to dealing with these vague but useful nonscientific concepts like ""the Pareto Principle"" or ""Agile software development"" or ""cloud computing"" or ""startup company"" or ""Zen Buddhism"" is that you need to approach your essay with a positive attitude. You need to think like an improv comedian: Train yourself to say ""yes"". An essay about ""what the Pareto Principle means to me and how my specific interpretation might be insightful"" -- like the one I've just tried to write -- is potentially useful. But an essay on ""what I think the Pareto Principle is and why I think it's totally wrong"" often leads to an embarrassing place. [1] It's like trying to punch a cloud. No, actually, what it is <i>really</i> like is trying to attack a straw man, because that is what you're going to end up doing. Arguing with yourself is difficult enough; arguing with yourself and <i>losing</i> in a believable fashion is nigh-impossible. [2]<p>There's a reason why another term for unscientific things is ""unfalsifiable"". Don't set out to write an essay on ""why this unfalsifiable thing is false"". You're gonna embarrass yourself.<p>On the other hand, a brave attempt to falsify the unfalsifiable is an effective form of linkbait. So I take it back everything I just said. Tune in tomorrow for my award-winning essay: ""Why there is no such thing as a startup company."" ;)<p>--<p>[1] If you want to argue with a concept like ""cloud computing"", you will be more convincing if you choose to argue with a <i>specific instantiation</i> of the concept. You can flame Amazon AWS, or you can flame a certain form of client-server architecture, or you can flame 
the poor security of a specific online backup vendor. All of which is more credible, because these things can argue back.<p>[2] Though it can be <i>great</i> for a laugh: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH1Dk-rZ1IE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH1Dk-rZ1IE</a><p>(read the following only if the YouTube link is down: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_%22Bomber%22_Harris_vs_Colin_%22Bomber%22_Harris"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_%22Bomber%22_Harris_vs_Co...</a> -- this is meant to be <i>physical</i> comedy.)",1254605949

And on really bad days, it feels like the sky has completely collapsed on you and that the only logical thing to do is make the world a better place by leaving it. It may sound silly if you don't suffer, especially when you recognize much of it is brain chemistry, but it is very real to the person experiencing it.<p>If you know someone who suffers from depression and has communicated to you that they have suicidal thoughts from time-to-time, I strongly recommend that you let them know that you are there for them at any moment when things feel really dark. They can call, text you, get you on the computer, whatever. Things can go downhill extremely  rapidly, so if you ever get a 9-1-1 from a sufferer, react immediately. Get to them in person if it's possible or get someone who lives close to get to them, don't stop communicating with them until you do.<p>And don't try to fix the problem, telling them it's all in their mind.

859210,comment,857655,857655,0,0,Chronos,,,"I have a similar point that I like to make:<p>Imagine two wireless devices that want to communicate.  You can have them transmit omnidirectionally, but now you have two problems: (a) you transmit radio power in all directions, including useless ones, which wastes energy/battery life, and (b) you create interference in that frequency range, limiting the number of such devices you can cram into an area.  If your devices can transmit their signals more directionally, at just each other rather than everywhere, you can fix both problems: your devices would require less power and produce less interference, making the world a much more gadget-friendly place.<p>Well, radio waves being what they are, they have a tendency to spread out as they travel instead of following a straight line.  When waves bend around corners, it's called ""diffraction"", and when waves bend in empty space, it's called ""divergence"".  Even a laser beam doesn't remain perfectly straight forever -- it ""decollimates"" over a long enough distance.  The best way to keep radio waves from spreading out, and thus to obtain the full benefits of directionality, is to use a wave guide.<p>A wave guide is a device that forces the wave to flow down the center of the guide, usually in a straight line.  It works because, as the wave approaches a section of the guide, it produces tiny electrical eddy currents in the sides of the guide, and these eddy currents repel the wave and force it to the center of the guide.  As the wave passes by and leaves, the eddy currents are re-absorbed by the wave, ideally leaving the wave with 100% of its original energy content.  (In reality, unless the guide is superconducting, the eddy currents will experience resistive losses, thus converting some tiny bit of the wave's energy to wasted heat.  But this tiny resistive loss is still much, much tinier than all the wasted wave energy that would've gone flying off in useless directions if the guide hadn't been there.)<p>If they're so great, why haven't wave guides taken the world by storm?  Because their cheap, flexible cousins are already ubiquitous: we call them ""wires"".",1254605103

I think a better analogy would be a Subway or a Starbucks in which you have a small staff at each location.

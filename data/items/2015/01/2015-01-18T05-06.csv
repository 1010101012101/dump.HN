8906811,comment,8906167,8906676,0,0,tel,,,"It&#x27;s a model of programming. Rather, it&#x27;s a <i>remarkably simple</i> model of programming. Any language could be interpreted [0] into it and thus its behavior is important for the comprehension of what &quot;programming&quot; means.<p>But that&#x27;s a bit weak. There are tons of models which achieve these properties. Turing Machines are popular. Why lambda calculus?<p>One answer is that LC is easily augmented with things like simple types or System F types or Dependent Types to introduce the entire space of nice type systems that people are beginning to really enjoy these days.<p>A better answer is that LC is essentially nothing more or less than a minimal description of what a &quot;name&quot; means. LC provides the simplest, best notion of variable yet imagined and its influence strikes every time you use one in any language (programmatic, logical, mathematical, human).<p>This isn&#x27;t the only way to go (for instance, the SKI calculus is equally powerful as LC, but manages to avoid all naming) but it&#x27;s a remarkably powerful one which has, if popularity is any metric, been completely dominant throughout the entire history of languages.<p>So, studying LC is a good way to learn about all that.<p>[0] Side effects would have to be modeled &quot;in universe&quot;, but the principle stands.",1421560715
8906810,comment,8904980,8906281,0,0,skuhn,,,"The former NSA lawyer sort of has a point, but he is over simplifying in order to mislead.<p>The first option is to use provably broken cryptography, like 512-bit export grade RSA, that the government can just bust whenever they feel like it. Of course, so can pretty much anyone else, so this offers almost no protection.<p>The second option is to use secure cryptography, like 2048-bit RSA, that is thought to be difficult to bust in any reasonable timeframe. However, the government can compel you to hand over your private key, and they can then use that to decrypt whatever they want. An attacker could also steal the key and do the same thing.<p>The third option, which is what companies have begun to realize is the only method with actual security from criminals AND the government, is to transmit data without using a private key that they control. A good example is iMessage&#x27;s use of device keys for parties of a conversation, without the use of a central key that lives on Apple&#x27;s servers. They cannot be compelled to turn over the master key, and no one can steal the key either. If they have done their job correctly, there is no way to compromise the data that doesn&#x27;t include obtaining someone&#x27;s phone. This third option is what the ex-NSA lawyer doesn&#x27;t even want to include in the conversation, even though it is what everyone is up in arms about right now.<p>It&#x27;s also worth stating that this does not offer some new revelation in privacy. If I had sent you a letter in 1885, someone would have to actually GET the letter to read it and know what I told you. A system like iMessage functions in the same way: to know what I wrote you, you have to obtain one of our phones. The NSA is just sad that they can no longer pluck the message from the air.<p>One final note: there are so many methods of communication on the Internet, and more launch every month, that I can&#x27;t imagine how they could all be monitored. Terrorists could be communicating with voice chat on Everquest 2. They could be arranging plants in their Farmville gardens to spell out coded messages.

It&#x27;s easy to hate now, but Java back then replaced all the server-side Perl programming that I did in the space of about 3 years, from 1994 where CGI programming was king to 1995 and the applets craze to 1999 when I was still regularly having conversations with people about the benefits of Java vs Perl to 2001 when you were actively hurting your career by not learning Java (not least because it seemed like the only people hiring were doing enterprise Java with horrible things like EJB and CMP/BMP).<p>Why did Java beat Perl? Well, there&#x27;s a lot to that -- but at least part of it has to do with that fact that Java was simpler and didn&#x27;t have nearly as many tricks up its sleeves (also known as the write-only problem). This is similar to the argument people today make when picking Go over other options like Scala. I also don&#x27;t think it hurt that Java came out of Sun, which on the one hand was extremely influential because they sold the hardware everyone with money used, but on the other wasn&#x27;t influential at all because they were &quot;big iron&quot; to the web&#x27;s &quot;why would I buy a Sparcstation when I can just put a PC under my desk?&quot;<p>Fundamentally, though, Java was very successful at becoming the language you wrote code in if you wanted to be taken seriously as a software engineer building web applications and you didn&#x27;t already have 5+ years of C++ experience.

Lip service to the public about terrorism is just that.<p>> Is anyone going to attempt to argue that encryption facilitates more fraud than it prevents?<p>No idea.<p>Keeping things on topic financial fraud, insider trading, etc is an example where strong encryption does complicate the state&#x27;s ability to enforce and investigate illegal activity. The purpose here is to draw from a well of motivation other than oft cited but never seen use of encryption in &#x27;terrorism&#x27;.<p>The government&#x27;s fear is that ubiquitous access to these tools will deprecate the executive branch. All tools from nuclear enrichment to hammers to animal husbandry have noble and malicious potential. Encryption is no different. The executive branch&#x27;s job is to allow the noble purposes and to discourage, prevent, investigate and indict the malicious.<p>From the perspective of the executive, encryption presents a serious hurtle to the pursuit of the malicious.<p>Yet disagreements between the public and the executive about the the scope and breath of executive practices along with the US incarceration rate, of legal exceptionality of the rich and powerful, and general unease with current power structure coupled with traditional mythical US values means that the public would like guarantees about their ability to communicate without being searched.<p>The US public wants its cake and to eat it too. Secure and private communication for the masses that can not be intercepted. But it wants the executive branch to be able to enforce the law and to investigate broadly.<p>The executive branch has made many proposals to this middle ground: the clipper chip and key escrow, proliferation of weak cryptography and the use of third party doctrine as a buffer zone mechanism all represent compromises the executive branch has made.<p>What it comes down to is that the US public does not trust the executive branch not to abuse a middle ground - it points to historical and current examples of extralegal abuse - and in general feels that its government represents their interests but only after compromises with other &#x27;more important&#x27; interests (international and domestic elite).<p>That is to say that the current state of &quot;front door&quot; encryption is a compromise made by the executive but one that the public does not trust.<p>Yet the public still wants law enforcement to be able to investigate insider trading.<p>So the government is in a bind. The government is justified to the people by its ability to enforce the laws of the land - if it can&#x27;t, even for technical reasons - it will have difficulty seeming justified. The government&#x27;s solution is to invoke the boogieman. &#x27;Terrorists&#x27; will get you if we don&#x27;t compromise. &#x27;Pedophiles&#x27; will get your kids if we don&#x27;t compromise.<p>But no, it&#x27;s not about terrorism - it&#x27;s that the government does not know how it will be able to stand up to proper strong cryptography in the case of true and perceived malicious use.<p>Freedom is like a dove, yadda yadda.<p>Encryption is like osteoporosis.<p>> Right. I find it hard to believe that Obama and Cameron are going to take away our encryption and someone convince our adversaries to abide by those rules.<p>Entirely. Historically this has been achieved by subversion of cryptographic methods, consumer products and standards and misinformation about security margins. It has made legitimate strong cryptography hard to come by but not specifically illegal. It is likely to become more and more difficult to perform this sort of influence now that the cat is out of the bag.",1421559278

That&#x27;s true.<p>But Python3 is an obvious failure and no one is admitting it, yet. I&#x27;ve seen claims from the core dev team about how Python3 is doing well because it has more downloads from Python.org, which is so stupid I won&#x27;t even address it. A comparison of PyPI download statistics says it all.<p>Python3 migration had many ridiculous ways of pushing people to migrate. The answer for Python3&#x27;s adoption was always something new. It reads like the list of reasons for invading Iraq.<p>Originally (and today&#x27;s) overly optimistic EOL for Python2, then automated code conversion utilities, then porting all the major libraries, then &#x27;six&#x27; type libraries to allow an ugly PythonX middle ground, then adding 3.x-only new features as a carrot, now the bright idea from the core dev team is to focus on pushing Python3 as the default install on distros.
They all failed. 
Python3 as default on most distros won&#x27;t do anything either.<p>All that said, and I think this is the best-case scenario: Python3 will survive and eventually thrive. It will just be a shadow of Python&#x27;s former glory.<p>Is that -really- worth forcing unicode handling? For Zeus&#x27; sake, I wouldn&#x27;t think so.

Title could just as easily read &quot;Obama will seek to raise taxes on Startups to finance ...&quot;.<p>Thankfully startups have at least the QSBS Section 1202 100% exclusion on the first $10m of capital gains through 2014. It helps smaller funds and founders, but there are enough gotchas (e.g. 5 year holding period) that VCs would still be looking at that 28 percent pretty seriously. I wish they would make the 100% exclusion permanent to eliminate the uncertainty, it&#x27;s hard making decent planning decisions when all the tax rates are changed retroactively at the end of the year.<p>&quot;The administration’s proposal on capital gains at death would exempt the first $200,000 in capital gains per couple plus $500,000 for a home, along with all personal property except for valuable art and collectibles. The rest would be treated for income-tax purposes as if it had been sold.&quot; -- Bloomberg.<p>That is absolutely terrifying. It would be bad enough to eliminate the step-up in basis and make heirs pay tax on the full nut when selling... but to actually <i>treat</i> the property as if it were sold, that means you actually <i>have</i> to sell it in order to pay the tax! This is actually extremely hostile to middle-class taxpayers.<p>Imposing taxes in the absence of an actual sale is brain dead. If your parents spend their lives accumulating a couple million dollars in assets they want to pass onto the children, you should not have to liquidate their entire estate just to give nearly half in taxes the day after they die.<p>Maybe all of this is after the estate tax exemption, in which case it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as catastrophic.

something quite common for
linear programming software.<p>E.g., think linear programming
<i>tableaux</i> and appending a new
constraint with its own, new
artificial variable.  Then do
elementary row operations to zero
out the row of the new constraint
in the columns of the old basic
variables.  Then do elementary row
operations to zero out the new
artificial column in all rows except
the row of the new constraint.
Then do simplex algorithm pivots 
to get the new artificial 
variable out of the basis.<p>Changing costs is also easy and 
standard in convenient little operations
called <i>post-optimality</i>.<p>There are more details, but covering
all of those would need much of a
course in linear programming.<p>E.g., the IBM Optimization Subroutine
Library (OSL) is quite nice work,
likely heavily from Ellis Johnson
when he was still at IBM before he
went to Georgia Tech where George
Nemhauser has long been and does
what you mentioned.
Once I
wrote some 0-1 integer linear programming
software with some Lagrangian relaxation
based on the OSL -- it was nice.<p>From Bixby, the guy that did C-PLEX,
and two Georgia Tech students,
etc., I would expect more than the usual

some good results in integer programming,
numerical stability, much larger problems,
exploitation of multi-core processors,

My FB chat&#x27;s aren&#x27;t like my MSN days, but it&#x27;s the difference between my teen years and my mid twenties (today), not a difference in tech. I still chat my ass off with good friends on FB, very similar to my MSN days.<p>Meanwhile I haven&#x27;t put anything on my wall since 2012. I literally use FB messenger to just send my best friends any stories or pictures I want to share with them. The other 250... they&#x27;re more like colleagues to me than part of an intimate circle. Which is why my wall is so empty.<p>How everyone else does it (posting general stuff on their wall) is beyond me, I feel like an alien. For example someone I hung out with in Korea just posted: &quot;Colorado we about to be all up inside of u&quot;.<p>He&#x27;s probably going to take a trip to Colorado. Why he wants to share that with his 1800 friends is beyond me. That&#x27;s the type of stuff I&#x27;d send a few of my friends, it&#x27;s just not relevant to anyone else. Didn&#x27;t even spark a conversation or anything either. I&#x27;d feel like a giant asshole posting stuff like that every day. HN is a world of difference, it&#x27;s literally the reason I&#x27;m on here.<p>Twitter is a mixed-bag for me. Thing is I don&#x27;t follow friends or semi-friends on twitter. Mostly just industry/professional/journalists I want to stay up to date on. So it&#x27;s usually a feed of highly relevant bits of information, so I quite like twitter. The other side of twitter (people who tweet with their friends) feels like teenage MSN chats, only less coherent, less conversational, more one-liner, and of course, permanent so I stay away from that.<p>I mean imagine you&#x27;re in a bar or on a bus with your friends just talking about whatever, and you gave everyone in the bar or on the bus a little device with which they can read every single line of the conversation you&#x27;re having. I&#x27;d be the weirdest thing in the world, extremely awkward, there&#x27;d be no privacy and it&#x27;d be completely irrelevant to the rest of the world. But somehow some people use twitter like that, posting public permanent random conversations that you&#x27;d normally (in the real world) expect to have privately, instead of using PMs or Private Group Chat.<p>That extends to things like &#x27;liking&#x27;. If I like a new book, I want to share that with my brother who reads a lot. I really don&#x27;t care for a guy I had class with last year to see that. Say you&#x27;re in a store and you see a nice shirt, would anyone send a letter to 250 of his friends about that? But some people treat FB likes like that. It&#x27;s really weird to me.

Even stereo speakers are usually not set up properly, and even most musicians don&#x27;t set their speakers up properly. <i>I</i> don&#x27;t set my speakers up properly at home.

Expecting people to set up a surround system just to listen to music? Forget it - as the lady said, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that.<p>In a movie theater, everything is placed pretty precisely and calibrated for a consistent level of loudness - although mroe and more these days, films tend to ignore established standards. Action movies are ludicrously loud and over-produced these days, for example, and directors like Michael Bay are notorious for demanding that playback levels be pushed into the red, resulting in genuine ear fatigue for many audiences.<p>At home, you <i>can</i> get nice results with a good home theater but again it depends how much time and money you want to invest in making it good. I just watch movies via the TV speakers because I don&#x27;t want 6 more boxes with wires trailing all over the place, and between living in a somewhat noisy neighborhood and having a bunch of pets, the distractions to a great-sounding system would just be that much more distracting, if you see what I mean.<p>On the other hand, if I&#x27;m watching a movie in the theater and someone starts whispering near me I have no problem with telling them to shut up or get the fuck out in 99.9%* of cases. Having done it, I can tell you it takes <i>weeks</i> of painstaking work just to get an adequate competent soundtrack into shape, so the last thing I want to hear is some jackass &#x27;explaining&#x27; it to his girlfriend like they&#x27;re sitting in the living room.<p>* A very few movies benefit from vocal audience participation, and of course comedies are there to be laughed at.",1427966105

One of the primary reasons for using Redis here is not so we can use Lua (even if it is great!) - it&#x27;s so that we can generate IDs using a service we already have.

Recent developments around the web platform (service workers, etc) are supposed to make web-apps compete with native apps and even Microsoft is starting to embrace this (web based skype). At the same time now native apps run in the web. It will be interesting how to this will evolve.<p>It also shows why Google developed NaCL and that it doesn&#x27;t really matter that it hasn&#x27;t been adopted by other browsers.

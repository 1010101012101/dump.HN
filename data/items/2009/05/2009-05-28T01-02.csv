629557,comment,628670,629390,0,0,Kadin,,,"In the case of a fixed amount of currency in an expanding economy, or if the economy expands at a rate greater than the amount of currency expands, you simply have deflation.<p>I'm not convinced this is nearly as bad a thing as some growth-uber-alles economists seem to think it is; it would encourage savings and cautious investment while preventing bubble formation.  It would slow growth, but endless growth isn't sustainable anyway.  (And increasing the money supply too fast, which there's always a lot of temptation to do, fuels highly unsustainable faux-growth.)<p>Also, although the amount of gold on and in the planet is fixed, the amount usable as a currency increases over time as it's extracted.  At least in the short and medium term (probably at least the next few centuries) you would be able to have mild to moderate economic growth without deflation as the gold supply increased.<p>The best argument I've heard against gold-based currencies is that is mis-allocates resources: it creates a huge incentive to go around digging up gold, which is an activity serving no real useful purpose.  When someone spends time and energy mining gold, they're not doing anything else with it; it's basically a dead-weight loss.  Still, compared with currencies that can be created arbitrarily it might be an acceptable tradeoff.",1243475316

You seem to mixing up the levels of abstraction as we cross the boundary moving into the car analogy.  Cars have industry standards, too.  Nobody knows shit about them.

My understanding of the US system (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is that those without insurance have no other option than to attend the ER.<p>Here in Australia you'd generally go to a GP, a public health center or have a locum come out to visit you before heading to a hospital. There are certainly still wait times, and a system like this might be able to help, but in general I think there's a much better spread of patients to the right location.",1243475025

I don't disagree with what you said, per se, but with its implications.<p>Let's say an animal's intelligence is not different in kind to ours if its intelligence is at least (1-alpha)I, where I is standard human intelligence and for some low alpha.  But what about animals of at least (1-alpha)^2 * I intelligence?  By this definition, they would be different in kind to us, but not different in kind to a creature not different in kind to us (one with exactly (1-alpha)I intelligence).<p>The point I'm trying to get at here is that while our intelligence seems different in kind to that of a dog, there might be a reasonably smooth intelligence slope via a number of other species.  So I think it might be questionable to assume that our intelligence is qualitatively different.<p>That said, I do think there are certain emergent phenomena that occur only at higher intelligence.  Which, I suppose, could be what you meant in the first place.",1243473359

By showing that the logical consequence of an argument is absurd, you show that it's flawed.<p>Either way: the poster I was replying to made no reference to human rights, or the ultimate reasons <i>behind</i> the laws.

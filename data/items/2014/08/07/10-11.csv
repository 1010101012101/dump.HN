It&#x27;s an interesting observation that Houstonians might care less about taxis, Uber and Lyft than the average city-dweller, but regular political analysis would suggest that this would give taxi firms (who cares a lot) more, not less, clout in the decision.<p>My guess would be that the reason for this decision not being controversial is that the supply of taxis in Houston isn&#x27;t strongly limited the way it is in NYC and SF (some Googling didn&#x27;t turn up much evidence either for or against this hypothesis). Which of course, again, would mean that Uber/Lyft would be competing on a level playing field and not just be scooping up heaps of customers who hate the entrenched taxi firms with a vengeance.",1407408412

If I came to you and said, &quot;does anyone even use these tens of thousands of libraries in Maven? How do other developers work on this afterwards, they&#x27;d have to learn all these new APIs!&quot; I&#x27;d likely get a response like, &quot;they&#x27;d just be expected to&quot;, with a chuckle. The mindset I&#x27;ve seen a lot is that language features are &quot;too hard&quot; to learn and should be avoided, but library complexity is beyond reproach and is rarely questioned.<p>Clojure the language takes the approach that it&#x27;s better to provide a dozen simple but incredibly composable tools that can easily replace a lot of duplicated boilerplate in other languages. Like these transducers, in Java/C# they&#x27;d likely be one of the design patterns that needs a whole set of classes to make what he shows in a few characters. Would you rather learn to write and read maintain a handful of classes, or just learn what those few characters mean? I don&#x27;t get paid by the line, and any abstraction built into the language like that is a few more classes I don&#x27;t have to maintain and possibly implement incorrectly in some subtle way.<p>Like I said, it&#x27;s just a mindset change. I know a company that only uses Clojure, and they hire a lot of entry level developers who haven&#x27;t yet gotten stuck in a mindset that &quot;languages are too hard; libraries are easy&quot;. They have great success with that, and their entry level guys are up to speed much faster than those in my shop, using .NET, where they have to learn a new language AND a mountain of boiler plate code using dozens of libraries and frameworks.",1407407690

It&#x27;s been my experience as well. \nNot just in all my salaried jobs, but even in the freelance contracts I took up.<p>My solution to that might seem extreme to many, but here goes: I simply stopped applying for any salaried jobs and ignored almost all the freelance gigs that came my way! \nThe answer to your question is that I&#x27;m not getting paid by anybody. I don&#x27;t even want to get paid by anybody. Working for others on _their_ ideas is something I find downright unpleasant.<p>When I worked for others, many tasks seemed &quot;menial&quot; / &quot;time consuming&quot; / &quot;boring&quot; to my mind. \nIn the past, I did not realize that this unpleasantness is simply because I&#x27;m working on others ideas, instead of my own. Instead, I blamed it on the field of software engineering. \nI even remember confessing to a friend that I&#x27;d started to find programming boring. That was some 4 years ago. As I said, things have totally turned around for me since then. Now when I work for myself, everything becomes a new adventure from which I learn something more. \nI feel that the only way to get work satisfaction and make any impact is to explore the frontiers in different fields, work on my own, indulge my hobbies and build my own innovative products. \nIt&#x27;s definitely a risk, but luckily I had built up a nice nest egg during my salaried and freelancing days.<p>If all this sounds too radical or impractical to you, then you can gently start off by offering to develop a full fledged software solution for a small business you know about via your connections (somebody mentioned veterinarians above...I agree with that kind of thinking). I&#x27;d avoid the freelancing sites though - they are a whole different set of unpleasantness.\nIn small business freelancing projects, you are usually the only developer doing everything, and so you will make an impact without any kind of restraints on your technical creativity. Depending on the luck and nature of that business, that impact may even be widespread in some way.<p>Of course, like me, eventually you may get bored of this too, since most such freelance projects too start off as CRUD type applications. \nBut even when implementing such boilerplate, I kept my mind open for alternate solutions that involved unconventional fields like computer vision and speech recognition.<p>Many business processes today involve humans in the chain only because vision, cognitive thinking, reasoning and speech do not have practical software solutions. Imagine implementing a computer vision based system that is able to keep accounts automatically from handwritten bills, without requiring users to enter details. Such problems are most definitely not solved. I&#x27;m ok if all I end up changing is making one local business richer and happier...it&#x27;s still better than zero.",1407407375

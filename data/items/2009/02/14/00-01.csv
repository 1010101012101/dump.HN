They attract copycats and their followers and the club dies, because the initial 'intellectually curious' crowd gets run over. Meanwhile, clubs that are overly elite and gated just don't have the style and communication culture. I've seen this, as a music fan, in Munich, Germany, over a period of 10 years. Often places that look like a dump are able to maintain their fans (that's one of the strategies).<p>2. Gated communities become stale quickly. Silicon Valley culture developed, because it was beneficial to work together with others as the pie was growing for everybody. (That's also why the industrial revolution created a middle class). The academic community is a stark contrast to this, because there is no tenure position out there for everybody. IMHO (5 years work at university) the communication culture is probably in the order of 50% toxic intimidation games (noise).",1234571835

Rather than\ntrying to certify individuals (too easy to game!) I think it would be\nuseful to have a certification process for organizations that involved\nan actual extensive interview process and audit of code and practices,\nwith associated scorecards and registration in some sort of official\ndirectory. Yes, you would have to pay handsomely to get this\ncertification, and the result would not necessarily be what you\nexpect. The details for this is all very rough and frankly I don't\nknow the value of it, just an idea that's been in the back of my mind\nfor a long time so I'm  putting it out there for debate.<p>The name and concept is somewhat influenced by CMM, which I suppose is\nanathema to most Agilistas. I'm the first to admit that I don't know\nmuch about CMM other than it provides a scoring system for\norganizations.<p>In a Rails context, you would establish a scorecard that categorized\nyour shop on a scale of 0 to 3 (or whatever, just thinking out loud\nhere)<p>RMM0 ""aka Cowboy level""\n- No formal development process\n- No test coverage\n- No standardized business practices\n- Static analysis failures<p>RMM1 and RMM2 would have to be something in-between. RMM1 is\nconsidered negative. RMM2 is considered positive.<p>RMM3 ""aka Master level"" (Purposely exclusive territory here, I can\nimagine that only a handful of shops in the world could achieve this\nlevel!)\n- Agile software development practices\n- 100% test coverage WITH THE APPROPRIATE TYPES OF TESTS (For\ninstance, at Hashrocket lately we are doing much less unit testing at\nthe MVC level because automated acceptance and integration testing\nwith Cucumber is so powerful and effective.\n- 100% pair-programming (muahaha)\n- Formal and standardized business practices\n- Institutionalized continuous learning and process improvement\n- Positive customer testimonials\n- Successful deployment of Rails application(s) with substantial scaling demands<p>Incidentally, I'm bringing this up for discussion, but I might be\ninterested in a joint-venture along these lines with an out of work\nsenior Rails developer that feels like taking the idea and running\nwith it.

This would have a similar effect from my understanding<p>2) Titanium Dioxide is kinda nasty to manufacture, in that it uses large quantities of chlorine.  Also, it has been classified as a potential carcinogen.<p>With those being said, as long as the net effect is a reduction in harmful pollutants or carcinogens, rather than an increase, it's a win-win.

1498182,comment,1497601,1498049,0,0,m_myers,,,"""No longer is climate change accepted as a fact.""<p>I would argue that this statement is misleading in more than one way. Starting with ""climate change"": do you mean human-induced climate change or the natural cycling? If you mean natural cycling, there's so much evidence that only fringe-dwellers would dispute it. And if you mean human-induced change, you say ""no longer"" as if it were ever accepted as fact.<p>Perhaps there is human-induced global warming right now, but I think at this point the track record of scientists attempting to predict future temperatures isn't good enough to structure entire long-term policies on.",1278611936

It would be modal, so that you'd have to be holding down a button (perhaps on the edge of the iPad's bezel) to enable ""hoverability"", but it would probably work well.

1498149,comment,1497601,1498049,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I agree.<p>If you want to do a quick sanity-check, you should play this out in your head using opposite scenarios.<p>Scenario 1: scientists discover a grave, real, immediate, and imminent threat to mankind. Some persuasion of the population is necessary in order to take needed action.<p>Scenario 2: scientists without malice exaggerate a threat in order to make their work more relevant. Some facile models are cooked up. Reproducible testing is deemed impossible. Other scientists glom on, hanging their conclusions off shakier and shakier science. Some data is made up. Some data is destroyed. Some data is selectively mangled, Some data is ignored. People who disagree are ostracized. Everybody ""knows"" that the threat is real, but details, predictions, and assumptions vary widely. Scientists are just another political action group, using propaganda and spinning stories to advance their cause. New research continues to agree with the paradigm -- outliers are shunned.<p>In scenario 1 the threat is real and scientists need to convince folks to take action. It's something like an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. In scenario 2 the threat may or may not be real, but that's not the point any more. Scientists need to convince the public to take action because they've already emotionally committed to a course of action, no matter what the facts say. People who disagree are either paid shills, idiots, or malcontents.<p>But here's the kicker: <i>The practice of science and the interface between science and politicians should not be different in either of these two scenarios</i> After all, Joe Public doesn't grok all this shit. One day one talking head is on TV telling him one thing. The other day another talking head is saying something else. It all just looks the same.<p>The least we can do is get this mess straightened out. The GW folks should be first in line and should be raising all sorts of hell. If there were an asteroid on a collision course with Earth do you think I would keep my algorithms secret, play politics with publishing, name-call, and join some political group? Fuck no. I'd have every scrap of data online, every little thing I did would be public and wide-open. I'd be giving tours of telescopes to look at the asteroid and dropping hammers and pennies from towers to talk about gravity. I'd be squeaky clean, open, humble, direct, and accessible. I sure as shit wouldn't act like these assholes.<p>(Obviously the truth in this case is somewhere between the two scenarios, but this is about a fucking lot more than just GW) Apologies for the profanity.

Most scientists claim way more than can be supported by their evidence, and it's not always clear what assumptions are being made.  There's a great talk, I can try to find it if there is interest, that discuss the hubris that most climate scientists have.  Observing a system for a tiny portion of a cycle can in no way tell you the entire cycle.  If you then admit that ""hey we don't know, but here's our best guess, and here's why we think it"" then you've got something.  Once something is established like like copper conducts electricity or the speed of light then you can say ""hey we're pretty sure about this"".   It has a lot to do with the maturity of the science and the tools and techniques available to the scientists.  Complex systems that cannot be decomposed and upon which experiments can not be made have should have a much lower confidence value than repeatable tried and true experiments. To conflate them is to cause confusion and to weaken the trust in more established science. Peer review is more about how to position your work in relation to others for ease of understanding than to verify the results independently.",1278610912

It's the claims that trip up future developers.<p>The musician example is pretty much bogus, because method patents have been  pretty much disallowed, though there is a movement to get them accepted.

Many arguments are made that ""the science is settled"".<p>Such arguments are sound, the logic behind them is the following: intuitively, we start out believing that if there were evidence against our hypothesis (in this case, unprecedented warming), with a high probability the scientific process would have discovered/published it. Since evidence against this hypothesis has not been published, we conclude with high probability it does not exist. The lack of evidence against it increases our confidence that the hypothesis is true.<p>Climategate has reduced our estimate of the probability that the scientific process would have discovered/published evidence against the unprecedented warming hypothesis if it existed. Therefore, such evidence may exist, but may not have been discovered due to bad behavior by Mann/Jones/etc.<p>I'll geek out a little. Let H be a hypothesis and let E be evidence against it. I.e., P(H | !E ) < P(H), and conversely P(H | !E) > P(H). Now let O be the fact of E being observed/published/becoming known to us. We can compute:<p>P(H | !O) = P(H | E) P(E | !O) + P(H | !E) P(!E | !O)<p>Bayes rule turns this into:<p>P(H | !O) = [P(H | E) P(!O | E) P(E) + P(H | !E)P(!O | !E) P(!E) ] / P(!O).<p>Before climategate, we believed that P(!O | E) is close to zero, so therefore P(H | !O)  is approximately P(H | !E) > P(H). After climategate, we must increase our estimate of P(!O | E), which in turn reduces our estimate of P(H | !O).",1278610609

The core claim that there are people who put far too much stock in the words-treated-as-magic ""peer review"" is definitely true; I encounter them all the time, to the point that I've also come to recognize it as a pattern. The fact that this is not true is, as you say, tautological. But some people need this fact brought to their attention, as it is clearly not generally understood.<p>I've come to classify attitudes about science now into three broad categories. Hostilty: ""I don't care what science says, Homeopathy worked for <i>me</i>."" Religious: ""Peer review is never wrong, and therefore the consensus is also always correct in every particular and those who disagree are <i>heretics of science!</i>"" Realistic: ""Science is the best way we have to find truth, but it isn't perfect either. The history of science should be learned and carefully examined, and it should not be forgotten that everything we see in the past is still around today, the only question is <i>where</i>."" Rather a lot of people fit into that second one, and think it is the best understanding of science there is, and tend to label people with the third level of understanding as heretics on par with homeopaths, too. Trying to prod people out of religion-of-science into realistic-understanding-of-science is a noble goal, worthy of a blog post.<p>Science has been wrong before, for decades at a time in every discipline I've ever studied enough to learn about its history (in addition to the current consensus), and the question is not <i>whether</i> there are disciplines every bit as wrong right now, but <i>which ones they are</i>. If you don't understand that or haven't internalized it, you <i>don't</i> understand the process of science, even if you can recite its tenants at will. When we say that science is a process, not an end-result, that isn't just words, it is the reality, and what it means in practice is that the consensus is very frequently wrong. There's nothing to ""correct"" in consensus if it's presumed always correct. The religious idea of science <i>makes no sense</i>; consensus <i>must</i> be wrong at some points in time, it is a <i>necessary step</i>.<p>(This is all discipline-neutral, by the way. I do have my opinions about which disciplines are most likely to be wrong right now, but I freely acknowledge those are <i>opinions</i>. Certainly in the past entire disciplines have made glaringly-obvious-in-hindsight-and-common-sense mistakes before and it is no great insight to think that there might still be such errors around. But again, I freely admit that only time will really tell, and there are certainly other wrong-consensus-views I agree with.)",1278608825

Optimize, optimize, optimize! If you're implementing a network app and there are no events coming in over the network, your process should be doing <i>nothing</i>, blocked in the kernel.<p>- Drop as much RAM as possible before you go under. There's only so much RAM on the device. Apple's frameworks try to drop as much as they can, but if you're holding onto a cache or anything that can reasonably be reconstructed, now is the time to drop it. This increases the likelihood of you surviving in the background after your process has been put to sleep, too.<p>- Work seamlessly.

""a well-placed little birdie told me over the weekend that they sold a grand total of 503 Kins before they pulled the plug"".<p>The ""over the weekend"" phrase is marking when he was told, not when the sales took place.  This interpretation is further supported by the ""that"" which immediately follows it, so as to separate the part of the sentence about the act of telling from the part of the sentence about that which was told.  And further supported still by the use of the term ""grand total"" in the phrasing ""grand total of #X before time_Y"".<p>That pedantic enough to prove the point?<p>Accounting for registrations by unsold units is a more likely source for the difference in numbers.",1278608803

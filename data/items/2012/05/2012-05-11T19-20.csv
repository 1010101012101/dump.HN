I'm saying that the value it has is finite (i.e. it saves money equal to the amount of fraud it eliminates) and needs to be weight against the cost of replacing all the card reader infrastructure.  And I argue that the fact the US has not upgraded is an existence proof that the upgrade cost[1] outweighs the savings.<p>[1] Really the amortized upgrade cost.  Remember that chips are dinosaur technology already, and have known problems.  What's the point of doing an upgrade if you need to dump it all and start over in 6 years anyway?",1336766358

What I mean by that is the App Store doesn't discriminate on an individual basis. Apple is generally consistent in their ""unfairness"". Looking at what Microsoft is doing, their decision to restrict Firefox immediately struck me as an anti-trust monopoly issue. They're not restricting Firefox on the basis of some policy that applies to everyone but singling out one piece of software.<p>The argument in this article is a red herring. This isn't about fairness. It plays on the whole Apple v. Microsoft thing and tries to drum up sympathy and or guilt by playing the ""you're just hating on MS because it's trendy"" card in a way. It really looks like Microsoft has decided to restrict Firefox capabilities on ARM devices so their browser can have a leg up and deliberately and negatively impact the user experience of Firefox on certain devices.<p>Framing this using Apple and it's policies/practices are an attempt at misdirection. If you take this attempt to play the Apple v. Microsoft card out of the equation and for a moment pretend Apple never banned FF and FF never even tried to get on iOS what you're left with is Microsoft unfairly discriminating against one company in an obvious attempt to stamp out any competition.

Now spending $115 mill per year doesn't count buying assets like mansions or fancy art, those are investments.

In both cases you have more money than you can spend year in and year out. You're really getting diminishing lifestyle returns the more money you make.

This was the early days of Linux (IIRC in ~1994 I downloaded SLS running Linux 0.99.x onto ~30 floppy drives over a 2400 baud modem!). Macs were an expensive niche product. Personal computing just wasn't possible without Microsoft.<p>Microsoft very much used this position to kill Netscape as they saw the Internet as an existential threat (fearing Netscape would be the new OS). They tried to subvert Java (the threat of ""write once run anywhere"" being a threat to the Windows lock-in) and partially succeeded. It was at this time that the DoJ stepped in.<p>I can't overemphasize the perception the tech community had of Microsoft then. Windows was rapidly evolving. Windows 95 was, I believe, a major turning point for the company (and where it achieved at least technical superiority over MacOS having preemptive multitasking and dynamic memory management). Microsoft really had an aura of <i>invincibility</i>.<p>We are not in this situation today. Apple seems unable to do no wrong (in the marketplace; there are what are still fringe elements criticizing them for any number of things) but don't have the market position Microsoft did.<p>In fact, Microsoft doesn't have the position Microsoft did in the 90s. At this point I believe we have viable alternatives to personal computing between mobile devices, Macs (you can get a Mac Mini for $600), netbooks and--dare I say it--even Chromebooks (you'll note that I left Linux off that list as I believe it will never be a viable mainstream desktop OS and of course I know it powers Android/ChromeOS).<p>I certainly don't see an issue (yet) with Apple blocking alternative browsers. Don't like it? Buy an Android. Or a Windows Phone 7. Or a Blackberry (OK, I couldn't keep a straight face with that last one).<p>Windows and Office are the geese that lay the golden eggs in Microsoft. Everything is beholden to them. As an organization, Microsoft seems terrified they'll die and as we've seen time and time again it's that fear and that switch from innovation to defending your turf that ultimately leads to the death of companies.<p>I believe the whole Metro API browser thing is just more evidence of Microsoft's stagnation. Let them I say. It'll probably, at least in some small way, hasten either their demise or them attempting to turn the boat around before they go off the cliff.<p>EDIT: yes Netscape was complicit in its own destruction. I used Netscape up until version 3. By Netscape 4 on a 486DX4/100 at least, IE4 was <i>significantly</i> better and faster and I never switched back (not until Firefox 1.5/2 years later).<p>Netscape eroded at both ends (IMHO). At one end obviously was Microsoft giving away the equivalent to their consumer product for free (as well as bundling it with the OS, making it harder to use non-IE browsers and so on). At the other end was actually Apache. The Apache Webserver I believe it incredibly difficult to build their server software platform (anyone else remember Netscape's Web servers?).<p>It wasn't until the rise of search engine advertising some years later that Microsoft's hold could be broken, it being the only thing that makes Firefox and Chrome possible.<p>As an aside to all those who are anti-ads: how exactly would non-OS browsers exist without advertising?",1336764058

3960847,comment,3959500,3959941,2,0,Canada,,,"> I would bet that the reason housing prices have outpaced inflation is due almost entirely to the popularization of rent-seeking activities and real estate speculation (not including the relatively recent distortions due to late 1990s deregulations that led to CDS and other financial ""innovations"" created to derisk the asset class beyond what was rational).<p>LOL. No. The reason real estate prices are so high is because when the central bank forces down interest rates money pours into investment class assets, driving prices up.<p>Our shadowy banking overlords wisely started tightening up years ago to avoid a US style disaster. CMHC (our equivalent to Fannie Mae) tightened credit to qualify requirements for mortgage insurance. As soon as these changes took effect volume of real estate transactions plummeted and price increases halted. But then they started creeping up again... and the reason has nothing to do with Canadian policy...<p>There is a sizable Chinese community here, particularly in Vancouver. Monetary policy in China is constantly devaluing the RMB, and Chinese citizens are scrambling to unload them. Tons of them are coming over here and buying up tons of real estate. So anyone in Vancouver thinking of using a real estate agent to sell their property: Make damn sure you choose a Chinese one who has mainland Chinese buyers. If you hire a native there's almost zero chance he will directly find a buyer and so they'll be no way to reduce the commission you will pay. I sold my condo a couple of years ago and NONE of the non-Chinese buyers whose offers I accepted were able to clear the conditions because their lenders had cut back on their borrowing limits. I ended up selling to a Chinese family moving here who paid for the $700,000 place with cash.",1336763902

3960844,comment,3958506,3959088,1,0,krschultz,,,"Interestingly, I have found this varies by region.<p>The major employer in my area (that I work at) has 15,000 people. The unions (factory workers and draftsmen) have to show up between 6am and 7am depending on their specific project (everyone has an exact time, and can actually be 'late').<p>Engineers can show up anytime they want and leave whenever they want, but typically 9-3 is encouraged as 'core hours' so there is overlap, but other than that we can set our schedules. Thus, I come in at 9am on most days. Most engineers come in more like 7:30-8am.<p>Because the main employer sets the tone, a lot of other companies in the area run an earlier pace. My girlfriend works at a completely unrelated company and started work before 8am. Most of the schools start very early (because the parents are probably out of the house really early). All the union guys are leaving work at 2:30 or 4 in the afternoon, so restaurents open early and close early.<p>Coming from an NYC office where 10am-6pm was the norm, 6:00am-2:30pm seems strange. But it does have some advantages.<p>First off, did you know the sun comes up EARLY. Holy crap was I missing a lot of daylight on the 10-6 schedule. I was up at 5:30 this morning and it was basically broad daylight out there. I went surfing before and after work yesterday while also putting in 9 hours at the office. That only happens if you wake up at 5 in the morning.<p>I personally like to maximize my outdoors-in-the-sun time so getting up at 530 in the summer and 6-630 in the winter has been a revelation. Yes, you have to go to bed earlier. But my girlfriend and I ditched the habit of watching TV before bed we both had from college (and don't have a TV in the bedroom) and that helps a lot.

Your signature is on the contract that you sign, not on some mythical un-marked-up copy.<p>In fact, this is often a good negotiating tactic: someone hands you a contract, and they just want to get it signed.
You strike out the price and write in a new price (or whatever), initial it, sign it, and hand it back.<p>The psychic weight is now on them - they have a SIGNED CONTRACT and all they need to do is to sign it themselves.<p>Taking the conceptual step backwards from a contract (albeit only signed by one party) to a contract signed by NEITHER party is a bit hard to do.",1336763395

I'm worried about spending a lot of time on this, only to realize that the performance hit is simply too large. I want this for debugging, and what I really want to try is to write a web-based byte code VM and compile Outlet to it. But the same concern exists there: can I get it fast enough to run sufficiently?<p>I'm leaning more towards the CPS route though. First of all, there's tons of research going into it. Secondly, I lose all the benefits of JIT-ed Javascript if I run it in a VM. There's actually a much higher chance that I'll be able to get CPS-ed code running fast than compiled byte code.<p>I admit that my current implementation is naive, and yes, the trampolines require even more thunks.<p>I'd love to talk, I'm very interested in this as well.

10393494,comment,10392578,10393147,0,0,drewg123,,,"There are multiple levels of compression.<p>What typically happens here in the USA is that your local TV station gets, via satellite, a &quot;master feed&quot; which typically is very high bitrate Mpeg4.<p>It then converts it to Mpeg2 (which requires a higher bitrate for the same quality), and compresses it to fit into its 19Mb/s ATSC 8VSB broadcast standard.  If your local broadcaster has no subchannels, then you win(1).  The network show gets all 19Mb/s of bandwidth.<p>However, if your local station has many subchannels (eg, 24hr weather, local news, re-runs of shows from the 1950s, etc), then they all share that 19 Mb/sec and you get far less than 19Mb/s allocated to the network show (especially when there is a lot of motion on the subchannel).   The worst I&#x27;ve seen is some ABC affiliates who actually had a <i>SECOND</i> &quot;HD&quot; subchannel for the &quot;livewell&quot; network, which made their network programming look horrible.   I put up a bigger antenna to pull in ABC from a neighboring market & avoid a local affiliate that was doing that.<p>Your local cable company picks up the MPEG2 broadcast and if you&#x27;re lucky, it just passes it through (re-muxing it into a 38Mb/s QAM subchannel).   If you&#x27;re unlucky, it takes the already compressed MPEG2 stream and compresses it harder.<p>Back in the &quot;good old days&quot;, the network satellite feeds were not encrypted, and people with the right equipment (Big Ugly Dishes) could pick up the raw network feed, which was reportedly awesome.<p>(1) That is, you win if the equipment doing the MPEG4 -> MPEG2 transcoding doesn&#x27;t suck.   I&#x27;ve consistently seen stations that have a lower bitrate but better quality due to newer encoders doing things like adding repeat field flags to telecined film content, so your mileage may vary.",1444920809

As far as I know, the main market that Theranos is targeting is outpatient / home testing. Yes, of course central labs in a hospital setting get simple and/or common tests back within a few hours--inpatient medicine involves a higher level of illness severity and thus a higher priority on lab values. I work with one of the major outpatient laboratory companies on a daily basis and I&#x27;ll tell you that their basic results are almost always back within 24 hrs and stat labs are back within three hours of the runner picking them up. In fact, probably half of our wait time is from the pick-up schedule (late in the day) and had nothing to do with these &quot;older&quot; technologies taking too long.<p>That being said, this particular lab company provides horrible customer service and our nurses probably spend more than an hour on the phone with them every week trying to troubleshoot very simple situations.

At one point it was just about writing content for Google because Google doesn&#x27;t know quality content from bad. This lasted for a really long time, beginning with Adsense about 2003 (because targeted content could bring in CPMs up to $1000) until eHow and the content farms finally began to get beat up in the rankings.<p>Then, about the same time that started to fade Facebook unleashed a traffic boom from the news feed. Newspapers, blogs, and content sites have benefited immensely from this. In this case it is not so much &quot;clickbait junk&quot; be re-written articles stolen from someone else. Take a look at a news site like the DailyMail, that is what is going on more or less. DailyMail is an interesting example because the content is produced so quickly that it is common for basic mistakes like the people in the photos being mislabeled or a male being referred to as a female and so on. Imagine how accurate the alleged facts are in that type of content!<p>I suspect the era emerging now is going to become a lot more difficult for both writers and content publishers.

These are different. There&#x27;s only one established religion in the UK, the Church of England, but it is absolutely possible to have your marriage officiated by a non-Anglican or even non-Christian minister. It would be completely wrong to claim that the Roman Catholic Church has been an established church in the UK ever since the Marriage Act 1836 allowed its priests to officiate marriages, or that the CoE is now disestablished because the CoE doesn&#x27;t permit gay marriage but gay couples can get legally married in other churches. Finland is another example; there are exactly two state churches but dozens of &quot;registered&quot; churches where one may marry.<p>There is, of course, an extension to be read into that part of the Constitution about not favoring a church in governance; it&#x27;s sort of the same way the Constitution has an unwritten right to privacy. But you can only read it in so far. It is not a constitutional prohibition on the recognition of churches, just on the establishment of churches. That word had a very specific meaning separate from &quot;recognition&quot; in 1789; it is a testament to the success of that amendment that we in the US have forgotten what it means.<p>It is worth noting that while everyone who wrote that amendment was still around and deeply involved, Congress wrote this resolution (<a href=""http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llac/001/0000/00160025.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llac/001/0000/00160025.gif</a>):<p>&quot;Resolved, that after the oath shall have been administered to the President, he, attended by the Vice President, and members of the Senate, and House of Representatives, proceed to St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel, to hear divine service, to be performed by the Chaplain of Congress already appointed.&quot;<p>And nobody thought that respected an establishment of religion.<p>(This is not to say, btw, that I personally agree with all of our current policies. I&#x27;d very much like to see us further disentangle legal marriage from religious marriage. I just don&#x27;t think we have anything close to a Constitutional obligation to do so, and we should do so because we the people want to. Being fortunate enough not to have an established church, we also have no Constitutional obligation to stick with the present system, either.)",1444918110

I usually set a $font-family-headings variable if I decide to use a third font for headings. All font-family names are set in this file and I never have to refer to them explicitly in any of my other CSS.<p>The elegance of setting a base font size and then having h1-h6 be multiples of that number is also a delightful convenience. And this is just the bare minimum of ways that SCSS can aid in composability...though to be honest...besides variables and the ability to nest definitions within each other...I don&#x27;t habitually use all of the other really nice features, yet.",1444918043

Long term means that we can, as maybe too simplified example, expect on the average only once in decades to get the new whole-world all times high (the fluctuations are the property of the system) but that they will steadily come, the trend is: &quot;hotter&quot; on the average. Not every single year.<p>> predictions for twenty to fifty years out are nothing but hedge bets.<p>Wrong. CO2 in atmosphere, the impact of it are the facts, and the speed it increases isn&#x27;t something that can change much without willful action.<p>> all the alarmism that many spread in the late 90s and early 2000s about how dire the weather would be by now never panned out.<p>Please any citation of &quot;alarmism&quot; from the real scientists (that is, an example of something such claimed by scientist, that was since disproved and that was believed by more than a few percent of scientists).<p>The IPCC reports are the result of the world&#x27;s climate scientists.",1444917721

It was pretty common for people think you were &quot;retarded&quot; for just being affected by it -- even though mine was sort of okay for treatment, with only sporadic GTCs. News like that nearly make me cry a bit, for real, this is incredible stuff. Not because of Apple or some fancy API of course, but because ordinary technology can finally do something for people with these conditions. I bet my parents would have given anything, their whole world, to have a way to be alerted when their small kid was about to have a generalized tonic-clonic seizure so they could be prepared.",1444917620

As far as it being a human driven event, we have made massive changes to the environment to say that we have caused zero impact would be incredibly foolish.  On the other hand the current climate change models can't predict known data (the past) so their future predictions are highly suspect as well.",1255960722

You don't learn language by making lists of words. Think of a word like 'but'. In Japanese, there could be 5 different words that 'translate' into 'but'. But you can also use tone of voice or draw out the end of a sentence to convey the meaning of 'but'. In other contexts, you might not want to say 'but' at all.<p>This all boils down to the author's definition of 'learn' and indeed 'knowing'. If after 90 days, the author is able to say that he 'knows' Japanese, then his bar for 'knowing' is a lot lower than mine.",1255960706

For some it means their personal environment, for some it means those below the poverty line. Almost always there is some 'demographic' limitation to what the world really means.<p>I think plenty of people genuinely want to improve the world, but because they realize their limitations they're forced to scale down their ambitions a bit and then they do their best within that framework.<p>And some get lucky and make a bundle, then spend it to materially improve the lives of as many others as they can manage. But that's rare.<p>For some people who made a lot of money in not-so-nice ways doing good is a way of atoning, or even PR. For others it is what comes most natural to them. Altruism doesn't have to come in competition with greed, it can come after it, or before, gathering money as a tool. There are all kids of scenarios here.<p>Over the years I've found that my teen-age idealism (""change the world for good on a large scale"") has bit by bit been whittled away by reality. Right now I'd settle for my definition of 'world' to be those people that I'm in daily contact with.<p>And yes, I really do want to do that, but I'm not sure if I will succeed, for any definition of world.<p>But I'll keep trying :)",1255959069

To be honest, the author of the post sounds like a somewhat spineless person who&#x27;s too afraid of hurting people&#x27;s feelings to manage effectively. The women percieve this and react to it, as perhaps the men do as well by completely ignoring her (not alpha, not a threat, no problems).<p>You can&#x27;t tiptoe around people and also lead effectively. Yes, some people will cry. Some people will have angry outbursts. But you remain calm, let them cool off a bit, and then move on with life.",1400266791

Do we really need another photo organizer? I&#x27;m an amateur photographer, and I take a ton of photos, but I rarely need anything better than Flickr or Dropbox or even a Facebook photo album. What&#x27;s the selling point for &quot;a better photo organizer&quot;? Is this a pain point that&#x27;s big enough to justify this kind of time and energy investment? Or is a &quot;photo organizer&quot; app the new to-do app for showing off mobile design skills?<p>Aren&#x27;t there more pressing problems to solve out there?<p>(Not trying to be snarky, btw. Just kinda thinking out loud. I fully support the developers&#x27; ability and right to build whatever they want. I just kinda think this is a first-world problem that has already been solved to death.)",1400266764

7757267,comment,7755742,7756648,3,0,araes,,,"> this feature makes it sound as an evil trick<p>Its not an evil trick, but it is playing on human emotion, and our inherent decision weighting when presented with uncertainty and risk.<p>You look at what its like being a college grad, realize how much trepidation there is about graduation and finding a job, and you shape an offer that:<p>a) Lets you get rid of that uncertainty very early (compared to normal hiring cycles)\nb) Makes the &quot;commitment&quot; not seem very severe.\nc) Alludes to financial stability (another big source of uncertainty, particularly with how big college loans are now)\nd) Promises to make future risks less severe (good references from a prestigious job)<p>The only thing it doesn&#x27;t really cover on top &quot;What I Want from a Job&quot; lists is &quot;will I enjoy the work?&quot;, and most new grads are still so inexperienced that they have no idea what kind of work they would actually &quot;like&quot;.<p>It still amazes me a bit how much of life and getting people to do what you want basically boils down to uncertainty / risk mitigation.  You don&#x27;t need an active carrot or a stick, you just need to change the landscape so your choice is the only, or obvious, low-risk choice that makes them feel more &quot;secure&quot;.<p>In some ways, YC even plays to this, as it offers guaranteed initial funding (lower entry risk), a beachhead to a wide range of funding sources (lower future risk), and low commitment risk (you&#x27;ve only got a small window of 3 months).  They may even have ways to lower the pre-decision uncertainty or to make YC more competitive with other options that I just don&#x27;t know about / recognize.",1400266697

Once you&#x27;re a real analyst, they ride you hard, and there&#x27;s no end in sight. That pain is just your life now.<p>> This is not common<p>Sure, it&#x27;s still not terribly common, but it was pretty much unheard of pre-crash. I know several who have made the jump. And the decision isn&#x27;t strictly developer vs banker, later stage tech companies have pretty substantial finance and biz dev divisions. Banking to biz dev used to mean you were 2nd tier and couldn&#x27;t land a PE or hedge fund job (or couldn&#x27;t take the pressure). It&#x27;s getting much more attractive now.",1400266156

If they entered science/medicine/engineering/etc, they would&#x27;ve added great positive impact.<p>I agree that students may be able to have a stronger impact as a doctor, scientist, etc. But this is more a criticism of K-12 education, not the wall street industry! I&#x27;ve never heard of a high schooler thinking &quot;should I grow up and be a doctor, or should I be an investment banker?&quot; What I have heard is &quot;I&#x27;m smart but not very good at math, so I&#x27;ll major in business.&quot; We do NOT have many students choosing investment banking over STEM during their junior year of college in the midst of recruiting. These decisions are being made during senior year of high school when they&#x27;re thinking about what to major in.<p>> And now they are abandoning these vital industries that actually produce something for an industry that is basically pushing papers around and printing money in the process.<p>Basically pushing papers around and printing money? Are you kidding me? If investment banks are so useless, why would essentially all large corporations (including Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, etc.) hire investment banks to assist in raising debt and equity or to facilitate mergers and acquisitions? By suggesting that investment banks are &quot;printing money,&quot; you&#x27;ve shown that you aren&#x27;t well-informed on the industry.<p>If your criticism is coming from the recent financial crisis, then sure, the investment banks due deserve some of the blame. But anybody who says investment banks are exclusively responsible and refuses to point out the mistakes by credit rating agencies, insurance companies, the federal government, and even US citizens needs to find an objective source and study the events leading up to the crisis.<p>> I know we live in free economy society and all that but I think we need to find a way to &#x27;regulate&#x27; how the wall street recruits.<p>Is someone being harmed? Given that the students entering investment banks are fairly intelligent and coming out of prestigious universities, they are also intelligent enough to find another job if they don&#x27;t like working at the bank. All of these banks also have well-structured internship programs, giving the students an opportunity to test the experience. Yes, the lifestyle can be very difficult for two years. But it&#x27;s a trade-off; students work very hard in exchange for a high salary and great exit opportunities.<p>> Lastly, I believe the ratio of liberal-arts majors entering Wall Street is way lower than the article seems to suggest. From what I hear, overwhleming majority of the graduates entering Wall Street after graduation are science/math/engineering majors.<p>That is certainly not the case. STEM may be a majority of the graduates entering fields like high-frequency trading, but STEM is a very small minority of the students entering investment banks. And investment banks are much larger (in terms of # employees) than HFT. I&#x27;m not defending high-frequency trading -- I agree it&#x27;s billions of dollars being spent on something that&#x27;s socially unproductive. But it&#x27;s inaccurate to make a blanket statement about &quot;wall street&quot; and apply it to any finance-related career.",1400265394

7757075,comment,7756332,7756332,4,0,mwcampbell,,,"This kind of problem makes it clear to me that application developers need to understand and be responsible for the full stack of software that they ship, including bundled C libraries. One can&#x27;t just use a high-level cross-platform runtimes like Mono/.NET and ignore everything underneath, because when the shit hits the fan, the app developer has to fix it, not pass the blame and wait for someone else to handle it.<p>(For the same reason, I think it&#x27;s better to rent dedicated servers than to use virtual machines or whatever-as-a-service. And colocation might be better still, if one can afford the up-front expense.)<p>What isn&#x27;t clear to me is whether we should still use a high-level runtime like Mono/.NET, for mobile apps in particular, even though we have to be responsible for lower layers. On the one hand, very few developers would want to mess with manual memory management and C-style error handling when writing business logic, database access routines, or UI code. On the other, if we have to grasp the whole stack anyway, then we can more easily do that if there&#x27;s less of it. On iOS, cross-platform C code plus iOS-specific Objective-C code is less complex than cross-platform C code plus P/Invoke glue for the former plus cross-platform C# code plus UI code in C# (which will be foreign to iOS developers not familiar with Xamarin) plus glue between Mono and ObjC. Similar logic applies to Android (although there will always be JNI glue between native code and Java) and even Windows Phone (as of 8.1, which supports WinRT and native code using that). So, for a more comprehensible software stack since we have to be responsible for the whole thing anyway, should we just give up on higher-level languages and runtimes, acknowledge that we&#x27;re ultimately dealing with C machines, and stick to C or maybe C++ for cross-platform code? Would that be putting too much emphasis on hypothetical debuggability, and not enough on other things like developer productivity and approachability to less-than-expert developers?",1400265101

Which is to say, I live and breathe PD daily, in a very personal way, through relatives and close friends, as well as doctors who have dedicated their entire lives to PD. I see first-hand what PD medications and DBS surgeries do to people, over a period of  many years.)<p>Your post is mind-boggingly misinformed and heartless. The &quot;relatively safe and effective&quot; medications you mention are not safe or very effective at all. They carry serious side effects for most patients and get less and less effective as time goes on. Even in the honeymoon years when the meds are still relatively effective, people still suffer in-between dosages, which is to say several times a day. The fact that people prefer being on them than being without them is a testament to how bad PD is, not how &quot;safe&quot; these meds are.<p>Likewise, the DBS surgery is quite risky - so much so that you have to be relatively young and healthy to get it, e.g. very few people over 75 are even eligible. Moreover, the improvements are typically in the 40%-80% range, far from the 100% you so happily imagine, so MOST patients who undergo DBS still have to take medication. The risk of stroke from the surgery is 2% and the risk of infection requiring another surgery is super high at 4%, to name just two.

Here are some of my thoughts and motivations.<p>Banks recruit ALOT of people and have offices across the country, they are very accommodating to your needs.<p>Applying for a bank seems much less intimidating than applying to a big tech company. The view is that only the very best even have a shot at interviewing at a company like Google/Amazon/Facebook, this puts people off.<p>Banks are at every school actively recruiting.<p>Banks host events like hackathons and advertise them. Amazon also do this in our area to be fair to them, but that one is usually after the academic year. Banks host theirs round about November time, and competing can allow you to skip portions of the interview process.<p>The offices are stunning and the entire place (Canary Wharf) has a feeling of being important when you&#x27;re a kid in jeans who has never had a real job, and lots of important looking people are walking about in their expensive suits.<p>They pay very very well.<p>One other motivation that is personal to me but slightly different. I don&#x27;t really want to work in banking. I want to run my own business, but I&#x27;m not ready to do that yet. I feel if I work at a company like Google that I&#x27;ll never want to leave, and that&#x27;s not how I want my life to be. So a bank is a great option. It&#x27;s good money, I&#x27;ll learn a lot, and it&#x27;s a respected name, and I will never be so happy with my field of work as to never want to leave.",1400264543

Now, I&#x27;m not saying that she overtly engages in that sort of passive-aggressive, competitive behavior (stereotypically female, but characteristic of the sexes about equally, if not more often by men, in the office context) against them... but it could be that she carries a subconscious bias that leads her to hire a different and possibly lower quality of women than the men she brings on.<p>If it seems far-fetched, consider the casual misogyny of a high school or college campus, and the vicious cycle it creates for young men. We&#x27;re not talking about a raving woman-hater. We&#x27;re talking about the average-case college male who thinks women are irrational, flighty, and manipulative. He&#x27;s actually right-- about most of the women he pays attention to. That&#x27;s the misogyny loop: guys who think ill of &quot;women&quot; tend to hang around low-quality women (high-quality women just avoid them) and end up confirming their own biases (&quot;misogyny loop&quot;). If he stopped focusing on the bubbly/popular girls with broken personalities (who get away with it, because everyone wants them) and took a representative sample, he&#x27;d realize that women aren&#x27;t any worse or better than men. Of course, such guys are usually blind to their own broken personalities.<p>See, I&#x27;ve never seen these patterns she&#x27;s described. I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of horrible people and only one of my top 10 is female... and, to her credit, she was pretty &quot;active-aggressive&quot; in her toxicity.<p>I know that these behaviors exist in workplaces, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re especially gendered.

These two separate copies of SQLite have no why of knowing about each other, and hence have no way of coordinating their lock behavior in order to avoid problems.",1400264132

I have had women on my team cry in meetings, but I&#x27;ve had men on my team explode in anger. Neither is appropriate.<p>Women on my team often want to &quot;gossip,&quot; but I&#x27;ve learned to recognize it for what it is: a (misguided) attempt to build rapport with me. I&#x27;m learning to redirect the conversation to be more positive. The men on my team are more likely to be jockeying for position, claiming credit for things they had small roles in, and generally exaggerating the truth. I&#x27;m learning to ask follow-up questions to get them to think twice before making any claims.<p>Males on my team are just as hard or harder to retain when compared to the women. I believe they&#x27;re more likely to leave when they&#x27;re passed over for a promotion or raise. Females at my company are perhaps more likely to leave because they aren&#x27;t feeling close relationships. Keep in mind that the reason someone gives you for leaving is not always the real reason. The author doesn&#x27;t seem particularly sensitive, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if she&#x27;s getting &quot;reasons&quot; for quitting that are actually just evasions of hard topics.<p>These are all just my observations and experiences, but I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of studies showing the pros and cons of hiring men and women. Whether biological or cultural, I&#x27;m positive there are both pros and cons to hiring either gender.<p>Regardless, you should see my point: it&#x27;s easy to get a little selective perception when you notice all the bad things about one gender. The fact that the author claims to be a woman and a feminist doesn&#x27;t excuse a thing.

I am pretty sure she reinforced - even if unwillingly - this behavior after reading this:<p>&quot;<i>I have developed a different approach for offering constructive criticism to male and female employees. When I have something to say to one of the men, I just say it! I don’t think it through – I simply spit it out, we have a brief discussion and we move on. They even frequently thank me for the feedback! Not so fast with my female staff. I plan, I prepare, I think, I run it through my business partner and then I think again. I start with a lot of positive feedback before I feel that I have cushioned my one small negative comment sufficiently, yet it is rarely enough. We talk forever, dissect every little piece of it, and then come back to the topic time and time again in the future. And I also have to confirm that I still like them – again and again, and again.</i>&quot;<p>When you put so much effort on something that is not the focus, that thing becomes the focus. If a woman cries after a reasonable feedback and you spend a lot of time trying to justify and compensate on that crying, the crying become justified. So you just reiforced the behavior. But if you are sure your feedback was a fair one; just let it go. Let her cry on her own, without giving much attention to it. She will stop crying sometime, think about things more rationally and the next time she will take feedback differently.<p>I think the case is just that women express themselves different from men. Women cry at the spot and go emotional. Men keep the things for themselves and talk trash about you later on the bar. If you, as a boss, could listen to the men employees and tried to get some confrontation about the trash talk men do, this would reinforce the trash talking and a lot of new issues would appear on the professional realtionship.<p>It is just bad luck in this particular scenario that women express their emotion more strongly and vocational; so I think some conscious actions must have being taken so this particular behavior doesn&#x27;t extrapolate in more serious issues.",1400263652

If they entered science/medicine/engineering/etc, they would&#x27;ve added great positive impact. Probably not immediately but eventually years down the line. And now they are abandoning these vital industries that actually produce something for an industry that is basically pushing papers around and printing money in the process.<p>Seriously, WHY would anyone choose to enter a field where you have to work up the ladder (or spend years in grad school and in poverty life) and possibly live in some small towns with a hope of making a few million a year salary ONLY near the end of your career, when you can enter Wall Street and live in NYC (great city but really only for the super rich) and start making 6-7 figure salary/bonus almost from the beginning?<p>Other major economies do not have Wall Street equivalent and so their top engineering/science graduates don&#x27;t join finance but instead actually enter the vital industries. And these smart kids actually produce something that is tangible. I think we are already seeing the effect of this trend showing its result slowly.<p>I know we live in free economy society and all that but I think we need to find a way to &#x27;regulate&#x27; how the wall street recruits.<p>Lastly, I believe the ratio of liberal-arts majors entering Wall Street is way lower than the article seems to suggest.

It is also fairly easy to weed these people out of the recruiting process, or, at worst, to part ways with them if we are not successful in catching it before hiring.

8354664,comment,8353006,8354553,4,0,clarry,,,"There&#x27;s legal freedom, and there&#x27;s practical freedom.  Sadly, the latter is seldom talked about.<p>You can be stuck in a maze, in a pit or under a tree trunk.  You&#x27;re legally free, since no law or copyright license is saying may not get out.  Yet, you&#x27;re stuck and if you can&#x27;t get out, you&#x27;re not free at all.<p>When it comes to software, it is the size, complexity and complicated interdependencies that make the maze.  As the system grows, an individual&#x27;s practical freedom erodes.  For instance, I complain about the web a lot.  Even with a browser&#x27;s source code and a permissive free license, there&#x27;s close to nothing I can change about it in practice.  It would be far too much work for me to maintain millions of lines of code and remain compatible and interoperable with a huge, fast-changing stack of technology... and the more you diverge, the harder it becomes.  It&#x27;s an uphill battle, and at some point you have to give up if you&#x27;re not the giant.  So the four software freedoms are reduced to two (or less).  In practice I don&#x27;t have the freedom to do what I want.<p>I think the FSF&#x27;s stance of reducing freedom to a merely ethical issue is alarming.  How would Dr. Stallman have felt if he had gotten his printer driver with a free license but so much code and complexity and dependency that it would&#x27;ve been impossible for him and a small team of hackers to actually port it and make it run on his system?<p>Of course, systemd alone is not approaching that level of complexity.  Except that it&#x27;s not only systemd.. the trend seems to be that all aspects of a modern OS are getting larger and more complicated.  A little here, a little there, it all adds up and becomes <i>a lot, everywhere.</i>  It&#x27;s a sad trend.<p>There was a time when you could&#x27;ve picked up a book that pretty much describes all of your system&#x27;s hardware at a low enough level so that you could start writing your own bootloader and OS from scratch, with the knowledge that you can interface with all the logical hardware devices.  And it didn&#x27;t take hundreds of thousands of lines of code.  Now the amount of accumulated cruft we depend on is so large that the idea of writing your own not-a-toy OS is laughable...<p>Standing on the shoulders of a giant is necessary and helpful, but when you have to do too much of it, it stifles innovation and encourages monocultures.<p>I don&#x27;t have anything against systemd per se; it doesn&#x27;t represent my ideals, doesn&#x27;t bring me features I want, and so I don&#x27;t want to use it.  If Ubuntu and Debian want to use it, they&#x27;re of course free to do so.  However, I am concerned that with the notion that &quot;systemd has won&quot;, its proponents are going to assume it to be everywhere and build future software with the attitude that it is okay to depend on it -- who cares about the people who would prefer not to use it, let them suffer for disagreeing with the king!<p>Before the systemd rage, sysvinit might have been &quot;the winner&quot; on Linux in the sense that it was most widely used and supported.  But we didn&#x27;t have this sort of polarizing &quot;sysvinit has won, fuck everyone and everything else&quot; notion.  Other distros with other init systems have happily coexisted all along, and these other distros haven&#x27;t had to constantly fight a growing dependency on one specific init system.",1411465358

Even the most basic phone on a purely landline call sounds better.<p>And I think it&#x27;s something many people have forgotten.  It wasn&#x27;t all that long ago that long distance companies (remember those?) used to actually compete over who had the best voice quality.  &quot;You can hear a pin drop&quot; - remember that?  Maybe not; I imagine these days many young people have never even used a landline.<p>I do think that poor audio quality is a decent part of why so many of us hate actually talking on the phone these days.  Having to strain to hear, asking people to repeat themselves, accidentally talking over one another, all these things make for a much more awkward experience.

The result might still be better (I haven&#x27;t done a detailed architectural comparison), but you do need <i>something</i>. For example one of the things I find useful about the &quot;systemd way&quot; of things is that it provides, finally, a story about how to apply cgroups to services in a sane way. The kernel provides the APIs, but actually using them from userspace was not fun previously, with multiple incompatible systems, largely based on tangles of shell scripts that had broken corner cases.<p>With FreeBSD, my impression is that manual shell scripting is still the norm. Integrating RCTL (FreeBSD&#x27;s resource-limiting facility) with service management basically consists of manually writing in a bunch of imperative calls to RCTL into scripts. There&#x27;s no way to configure services with limits declaratively, ensure the right thing happens when services are started/stopped, etc., precisely because there&#x27;s no integration between the RCTL facility and the process-management or init facilities. Or at least I haven&#x27;t found a way.

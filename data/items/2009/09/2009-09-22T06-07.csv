836452,comment,835821,835821,0,0,ismarc,,,"I've been considering an ISP co-op recently, and if the economy finally hits me, I will probably give it a start.  There's a lot of core pieces that are going to cost the absolute most.  Telecommunications is heavily regulated and there is lots of patents/IP to make sure not to step on.  So first, you need a crack lawyer on hand so the first part gets out the gate properly.  Second, you need infrastructure.<p>This comes in three forms.<p>1. Wires in the ground, you can bury them yourself at really high cost (this is where current providers have the edge, they were given subsidies in exchange for time-limited monopolies in areas), you can lease them from current LECs/providers (I'm not sure what sort of local fiber infrastructure is leasable, but I know copper's easy to lease at reasonable costs for last mile).<p>2. Backbone.  You have to provide a connection to the network you're providing access to (telephony/internet).  With that, you either need connection to the LATA or peering agreements for internet based traffic.  Not cheap.<p>3. Infrastructure.  To provide reasonable service, you'll need the initial capacity for 3-4 times your customer base.  Eventually, you'll be able to get to a point where you're over-subscribed but usage patterns keeps quality good for the consumers.<p>From my research so far, only $150 million is needed to open doors for business, with $20 million in operating costs per year.  You then have ~$4 per customer per month cost with 5% population penetration.  The cost per consumer drops pretty rapidly as you gain traction because you make better use of the cables.<p>The real problem is marketing.  Costs are going to be outlandish.  And why would a business or consumer choose a new company with a low number of customers?  There's a couple of approaches, such as excellent customer service, a carpet bomb/napalm style marketing campaign where everyone and there brother knows you provide the service, and cheaper than the competitors.  Then you have the issue of other companies have multiple services they provide, meaning you have to get past the bundle service issue.",1253602689

836437,comment,836206,836206,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Interesting, thought provoking, and most likely correct general premise - followed by a bunch of incorrect correlations and details.<p>> Clearly, more and more jobs will move from more developed nations to countries like China, and it is difficult to see how, as this process continues, the United States retains its leadership position. In fact, it seems entirely possible that the U.S. will exchange places with less well-developed nations.<p>The United States has <i>never</i> been good at continuing dominance in a field they invent. Basically, it gets invented in the USA, and another part of the world gets better at it and takes over within 30-70 years. Historically, the US economy would've collapsed many times over had we not kept ""inventing our way out of it"". If it keeps up, USA keeps going. If not, starts to fall apart. Of course, the following isn't true:<p>> And the labor that <i>is</i> needed can’t be done in more developed nations because there are people elsewhere who will happily provide that labor less expensively.<p>""Can't"" isn't the right word. There's certainly enough people that would be happy to work for the ever-increasing buying power of a modern day $5 to $20 per hour, and people would pay a premium to not have to ship things across seas and to be closer to their factories. The problem is that the labor laws in the USA has changed it from an economy with very many $15-per-hour jobs into one with a few $40 to $70 per hour jobs due to our laws.<p>> When we create devices that individuals will be able to own that will be able to produce everything that we need, the solution will be at hand. This is <i>not</i> science fiction. We are starting to see that happen with energy with things like rooftop solar panels and less expensive wind turbines. We are nowhere near where we need to be, but it is obvious that eventually everyone will be able to produce his or her own energy.<p>This is, of course, very false. It ignores economies of scale. Energy will eventually get closer to free, but it will most likely be because of giant nuclear fusion or hydrogen plants or something like that. The trend is towards even fewer institutions providing our basic needs, not spreading it out. What will happen is people will turn to more ""intangible"" sorts of work - sciences, philosophy, aesthetics, design, communication, and so on. There'll be lots more people working on things that would have been frilly or an unnecessary luxury in years past.<p>> This means that a small number of people, the people in control of the creation of goods, get the benefit of the increased productivity.<p>False! The quality of life across everywhere has increased a lot faster than the quality of life has improved for the rich. Now, the barriers to entry into industry as all but disappeared, and the ""American Dream"" of rags to riches is more possible than ever. You can get the benefits of economy of scale without a lot of money by having Amazon host it for you or some such. I had dedicated warehouse and automated shipping for orders at a company I ran for $200 per month + $2.50 per package shipped at my small company. It's going to be possible to get wealthier than ever.<p>Now, the wages for unskilled labor will fall off a bit, even as the prices of things get cheaper. I don't know which will fall faster going forwards, but so far, prices of essential goods and luxuries have fallen faster than unskilled wages. But also, there's been a shift to skilled labor in the developed countries, and what Peter Drucker called ""knowledge work"". Yeah, gradually there will be less people needed to tar roofs and roof-tarring wages will fall, but nobody <i>really</i> wants to do that anyway. As cheap, easily installed roofings improves more and more, there will be less roof tarrers, but kids that would've become roof tarrers will become computer programmers or writers or systems engineers or biochemists or whatever.<p>> Unfortunately, that wealth will be held by a very small number of people. And their operations will need to employ very few people.<p>This is such old world thinking. Yes, there will be less traditional, unskilled jobs. No, those people won't die in the streets. People are resilient. They'll move into other, more necessary positions that fill the new needs, as the old needs get cheaper than ever to buy.<p>> In short you will have a few very wealthy folks, and a much larger majority that will just not be needed for the most important things that the country needs to do.<p>Author could've written this about cars too, and how it's going to kill all those horseshoeing and horsebreeding and carriage driving and carriagemaking operations, and how the world is going to be a mess, and it would've looked correct.<p>Again, interesting premise, hadn't thought about it, probably correct. The follow-on conclusions are way off base.",1253602170

836432,comment,836238,836238,0,0,jtg,,,"I use Amazon EC2 for several reasons. They basically boil down to having everything I want with little hassle.<p>- I can hold my own as far as basic sysadmin functions go, and I like having control over the entire software stack. A lot of Amazon EC2 machine images can be stripped bare to give me only what I need.<p>- I don't have a lot of money to blow on a dedicated machine each month, so it's nice to at least have a running environment even if it's virtualized (and therefore slower). At least I can know if my code works out in the wild.<p>- I pay only for what I use. There's also the option to leave it on and pay in advance (Reserved Instances). So whether my projects end up being just small diversions or whether they gain traction, there's a pricing plan I can go with. It was meant for companies to scale up and down, but I've actually found it useful for scaling my personal projects up and down.<p>- The management tools are pretty good. ElasticFox is clunky at times but it has everything I need without a whole lot of hassle.<p>- Elastic IPs. I can claim a static IP if I wish, or just choose not to use it.<p>Amazon has exposed a lot of stuff over their APIs, but don't be fooled into thinking that this means they added layers and layers of cruft akin to all the useless software that comes on new PCs. The APIs just work on a meta level -- useful if you want to package up machines and that kind of stuff -- but if all you need is a Linux box with good bandwidth for your personal projects, give Amazon a shot.<p>There's also the added bonus that they're, well, Amazon.

  ""Demographers, who had been watching the exponential rise with alarm, now forecast that the population will peak below ten billion—ten gigapeople—not long after 2050. Such a low forecast would have been unthinkable just two decades ago. Already, in developing countries, the number of children born per woman has fallen from six to three in 50 years. It will have reached replacement-level fertility (where deaths equal births) by 2035.<p>This is an extraordinary development, unexpected, undeserved—and apparently unnatural. Human beings may be the only creatures that have fewer babies when they are better fed. """,1253599529

They also hav an IRC channel #prgmr on freenode.<p>For testing and dev of a rails app, 128mb seems fine. Passenger+apache+mysql<p>I use account only for testing my rails app in a remote server. I tried running a personal blog on wordpress+apache along with the rails app. It got out of memory and I had to add a 512mb swap space to get it working fine(they've got instructions on their wiki). So if u are planning to get vps frm them just for testing out stuff, get 128mb or 256mb. That should save costs while you develop the app. Later on you can add resources. Just my 2 cents :)",1253599503

It just means that different parts of the functionality of the kernel are split up into different programs.<p>But those programs have to talk to each other, and this message passing overhead increases with increased functionality (more programs).  So it seems likely that there would be a definite performance drop as the functionality of a micro kernel increased.",1253599349

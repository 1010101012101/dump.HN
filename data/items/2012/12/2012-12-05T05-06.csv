This means that only the actual number of requests concurrently being fulfilled (cached value is being retrieved from ram or storage, or is being written to the socket) is limited by the amount of kernel threads.

But it is certainly wrong - FBI <i>can obtain access</i> to everybody's email if it is hosted by US provider such as Google, given enough cause to obtain warrants (such as suspicion that CIA director's email account was compromised). This is not news - hardly anyone in the US has doubts that given strong enough cause, FBI can solicit and receive access to specific accounts at US providers.

Without taking position, let me just share a few facts (I work with this...).<p>- DPI is used in most networks in the world, and is mainly used for throttling P2P or for traffic analysis. Legal interception e.g. classical wiretapping is a different thing, although it could use same hardware.<p>- DPI does cost some resources to the operator but the impact on end users is negligible (except for malfunctions or improperly dimensioned DPIs). It only adds a tiny amount to latency, which puts an upper limit on bandwidth. In many cases, the bandwidth is limited somewhere else on the link.<p>- DPI hardware works in several stages, typically: analyze IP flow (shallow inspection), if not enough to decide, to DPI (analyze HTTP headers etc), if not enough to decide, rely on heuristics based on traffic pattern etc.<p>- DPI is not very good at all at dealing with encrypted traffic, and most DPIs will not be able to do anything else than shallow inspection. (some claim to do traffic flow analysis, and some (normally transparent proxies) can break the HTTPS flow in two, but it would generate client errors).<p>- ITUs specifications won't have much impact on what ISPs do at the moment (as they already do it) but I guess could be a part of the wider regulatory discussion.",1354686168

4875063,comment,4874304,4874564,8,0,haberman,,,"Strongly agree with all of this.  I think PHK is right that you don't want user-space and the kernel to fight, but the solution isn't ""leave it all to the kernel,"" it's ""leave it <i>out</i> of the kernel.""<p>The fact that you can outperform the kernel's abstractions (as you mentioned) clearly demonstrates that the kernel's algorithms aren't ""one size fits all.""  So why are they in the kernel at all?  Thank goodness that facilities like O_DIRECT let you bypass them (even though Linus thinks you should never do this: <a href=""https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/10/233"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/10/233</a>).<p>I am <i>not</i> arguing that everyone should roll their own memory management.  We have a lot of sophisticated ways of sharing code in user-space, like shared libraries.  The beautiful thing about user-space libraries is that you voluntarily choose them based on the value they provide to you.  If caching library A gets one-up'd by caching library B, competitive forces will allow the upstart competitor to displace the incumbent.  But OS kernels are in a privileged position; they have exclusive access to the hardware.  It's not easy to just drop in a competing OS scheduler, even though other approaches may be better than what Linux does.  That's why kernels should contain as little functionality as possible.<p>Another reason is accounting and isolation.  The resources used by kernel-space are shared between processes, which can lower overall resource use but also means that no user-space process can be ""charged"" for them or guaranteed an isolated share of them.  For this reason, some systems I've been in contact with lately actually do all disk caching in user-space, so that (for example) a huge read from one process can't evict all the pages from someone else's process.",1354685877

The Go compiler errors out on compile errors. Unused variables and imports are two things that people typically assume should be warnings, and are surprised to find them as errors.<p>So I don't think your fears are well-founded here. Go is a much stricter and clearly defined language than C. There are far fewer edge cases and ambiguities. The spec is much easier to implement, and indeed there are two complete compiler implementations that agree with each other and the spec.<p>That WebKit or any other large C project could produce no warnings is, of course, hard to imagine. C compilers emit warnings like... well, I can't think of a clever simile. But the point is, it's totally normal for C programs to emit tons of warnings.

SSL (https) as it is currently implemented in browsers has the vulnerability, that you trust all certificates signed with any root certificate which are installed in the browser. So if you have a dedicated browser, where you have deinstalled all default certificates and installed only your private self-signed certificate, then SSL is (to the best of my knowledge) secure. Unfortunately your server has no way to check, which certificate the client sees ( and vice versa). Therefore it can not enforce the use of this specific browser. ( And this obviously does not work for a public website.)<p>By contrast in the case of ssh the server and client each store a key for the specific connection. In this case your connection is essentially as secure as the key exchange. And if a mitm (Man in the middle) attack was already in place when you established a connection for the first time, then ssh will warn you if the mitm attack ends. ( Since in this case the server sends you a different public key than the stored one, which was corrupted by the mitm attack. )",1354685623

The message appears to be that, ""sorry, we agree with you the seller but since the buyers bank agreed to the chargeback you are out of luck.""  In my view the State AGs should force Paypal/Ebay to take the loss in the case of fraudulent chargeback thus providing an incentive for Paypay/Ebay to fix the system.

I made the profile as private as I could (unfortunately the bulk Greasemonkey scrips I found for this were buggy, so i did most of it by hand...).<p>It was a pain, because of Facebook's stupid phone authentication thing, but I managed to set up basically a fake account for linkage and following companies.

It has been fantastic, and I haven't looked back, nor do I want to.<p>What stood out in the article is what he said about being oversensitive. I think social networking is a deathtrap for those who have problems like that - myself being one of them. There are some webcomic artists that I follow who I've seen go down a pretty dangerous path getting overly involved in Twitter - petty comments and stuff made against them, things like that. I see a lot of people spiraling in self destructive behavior using social networks as a medium, and it is so healthy and wonderful for people with those tendencies to stop using them.<p>Another side effect is that it really showed me who my true friends were. I figured that if people ""couldn't"" communicate with me if I left Facebook (apparently texting or emailing is too ""old school""), they weren't worth having as friends. It's really funny that most people I talk to say, ""Oh well, you know, I wouldn't be on it, but there are these people that I, like, can't contact any other way.""

When cancer starts spreading it is called metastasizing. Often this spreading uses complex functionality of other types of cells like fibroblasts, which  tear down and recreate the extra-cellular matrix, or like white blood cells which can squeeze through and move around like an amoeba.<p>Evolution, and cancer causing mutations that result in a successful cancer, often just randomly breaks and fixes functionality like this and it happens to work. The linked critique has one point where it says ""polished exteriors of urbane and civilized modern cells"" which is complete nonsense. Modern cells are full of broken crap.

Unfortunately, context-switching has become extraordinarily expensive for a lot of server software which makes multithreading a less palatable option.<p>These days, you want (1) native async I/O, (2) strict control of cache replacement behavior, (3) strict control of I/O scheduling, (4) minimal context-switching, and (5) memory locality control. On Linux, this means DIRECT_IO, io_submit, managing your own physical cache RAM, and locking one thread to every core (ignoring hyperthreads for the moment). This is more complicated to implement because there is not a simple, portable interface like mmap() widely available but it is also much more efficient and performant when done correctly. To make matters worse, some useful interfaces (like io_submit) are poorly documented.<p>But yes, if you build your own memory and swapping subsystem directly on top of the native interfaces, and use threads as an abstraction of a core rather than a swappable context, you can build very efficient server engines that stall minimally on I/O. (Note: even using io_submit and IO_DIRECT for async disk access, there are conditions that can cause blocking. They are just much rarer and easier to manage than mmap().)",1354684078

I think we've already seen the ""phase out"" of small developers in the App Store; rarely if ever does an indie company make it into the top 25 charts or, more importantly, the Spotlight app section.  I don't really anticipate it becoming much worse than this because the submission process is mostly effective at weeding out the fart apps and broken software that often makes it into something like the Android store, and apps at the bottom are naturally hidden from the end user anyway.<p>I think the reason Apple can continue to allow mediocrity into the store is because those apps don't actually reach many end users and they pad those 700k apps and 25 mil songs vanity metrics.  This is opposite someone like Groupon or a high end designer brand, where exclusivity is a major factor and driver.

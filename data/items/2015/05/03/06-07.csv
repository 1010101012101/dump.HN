However, I don&#x27;t have a CS degree, and my work as a full stack web developer has only put me in contact with garbage collected languages: NodeJS, PHP, and a little Python.<p>I just spent an entire week working on a chatbot in Rust, and I found the steep learning curve to be very challenging. While Rust seems to be a big win for teams that are accustomed to C++/C development, it does seem to be very demanding for web devs who always work with a garbage collector.<p>In particular, I was trying to use Iron to write an http server that could receive web hooks. Iron, quite sensibly, handles each incoming request to a server in a separate thread. However, as a beginner it&#x27;s very challenging to figure out how to persist data between requests without writing to disk or persisting to a db. Mutating state across threads is hard. Currently, there&#x27;s also no version of channels that are single producer, multiple consumer. I&#x27;m sure as the ecosystem develops, more examples will make this easier, but for now it&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to figure out.<p>Fortunatey, the #rust IRC channel supported me all the way. It&#x27;s a very friendly and active community, but without their support I would have probably given up.<p>I look forward to seeing more posts at this level of detail help those of us struggling to learn Rust understand how the experts use Rust.",1430635076

The former two are also sometimes mixed in to 肠胃, in which case they mean stomach. Honestly, after 15 years mostly in the country it still amazes me how clearly people delineate between three words for essentially the same thing, and heartily state one is correct for a given situation, as if suddenly they meant three completely different parts of the body (which, technically, 肠 does and 肚子 could, but in reality neither are clear).<p>For instance, if one has diarrhea (a quintessentially Chinese experience), then one has 拉肚子 (&#x27;a pulled belly&#x27;). If one has virtually any form of digestive tract discomfort, one is 胃痛 (&#x27;stomach pain&#x27;). More formally, 肠胃炎 (&#x27;gastroenteritis&#x27;) is used.

A job interview is fundamentally a competition against other candidates.<p>I think you are being a bit negative. Why not believe the interviewer? It seems pointless to trick candidates by suggesting they are safe to look things up, then secretly judging them worse than other candidates. I would judge more harshly someone who didn&#x27;t ask if they could look something up, or assumed they couldn&#x27;t. Particularly so if they had been told they could but then proceeded to struggle and not look something up or ask the interviewer. I&#x27;d rather someone I may work with have a relaxed attitude and inherent curiosity rather than a paralyzing fear of failure.<p>Also viewing it as fundamentally a competition is focusing a lot on the negative perspective from your side. An interview is about finding a good match between a company and an employee. It can be just as much about you finding somewhere you want to work as it can about them comparing you to other candidates.<p>There may not even be other candidates, and they could be trying to make you comfortable and give you an idea of what it would be like to work together.

I can&#x27;t find any spot in the article where the author raises the concept of the rate of people dying prematurely at a given point in history, and definitely not any place where he connects that concept to DPUs.<p>My understanding of the DPU is as the amount of change required in daily life for a single time travelling individual to &quot;die of shock&quot; upon experiencing another moment of time. In the examples provided, 100,000 BC to 12,000 BC was enough change in day-to-day life experience to cause a person from 100,000 BC to &quot;die of shock&quot; if they were transported to 12,000 BC instantaneously. The same assertion was made for 12,000 BC to 1750 AD, and 1750 AD to 2015 AD, with the author&#x27;s conclusion being that there has been an exponential shortening in the timescale required for enough change to occur in the daily experience of human life to cause a time traveler to &quot;die of shock&quot;, and that such shortening will continue into our future -- possibly to the point of allowing such a level of change to occur multiple times within our own lifespans.<p>I took the entire discussion of DPUs solely as an exercise in generating an evocative image for illustrating the increasing rapidity of change in our qualitative experience of life. I don&#x27;t think the &quot;die of shock&quot; idea is meant to be taken literally; it&#x27;s just a convenient stand-in for &quot;extremely shocking, to the point that the experiencer may be incapable of processing the instantaneous change rationally&quot;, not a measure of people actually dying.<p>(Sorry for going to such length, I just wanted to be precise.

It&#x27;s protecting yourself from criminals..but it seems with all of the latest news stories, criminals are protected, adored, and idolized.<p>It&#x27;s also not even about the actual effectiveness of the gun.  When it&#x27;s well-known that you have a weapon, crime decreases.<p>&quot;I mean, what scenarios do you see guns being a good solution for, compared to nonlethal self defense tools like pepper spray?&quot;<p>Pepper spray is also heavily regulated in nearly every state and isn&#x27;t really that effective.  The way I see it, if I can&#x27;t legally own a gun and a criminal hurts myself or my family, the people that passed the laws prohibiting me from protecting my family (and those that supported these laws) should go to jail as well.",1430633028

But in the hour or so that is ubiquitous among individual interviews (even if repeated four or five times with different interviewers), you aren&#x27;t going to be any meaningful information out of anything the interviewee will have time to code. An hour is enough time to write something trivial. Anything that really pushes a developer&#x27;s skills is going to need a big part of that hour just for them to put pen to paper for design. The best interviews I ever had involved a week-long spare-time development project at my own pace. Those are the only interviews I ever was able to really show what I&#x27;m capable of. Incidentally, my interview at the Googleplex I thought was worthless.",1430632995

Get a job with a EU based company (in the Schengen agreement), but in their local office to you. Work for a couple of years there. Then get a transfer to one of their EU offices. Work there for a number of years. Apply for citizenship. The process is of course more complicated than that and dependent in which country you pick, but that is the general gist of it. But do your research.<p>Although I would personally recommend that you stay where you are and join a movement to change your country.",1430632917

6416004,comment,6406832,6414008,1,0,hosh,,,"As I mentioned, it was two working parents <i>and</i> the move to surburbia. (Well, I said non-walking-friendly neighborhoods, and didn&#x27;t elaborate). This was what changed.<p>These suburbs, often designed after 1950s, were designed for car travel, rather than walking or biking. Many suburbs are designed with streets as fractals, often without sidewalks. It might be a &quot;safe&quot; subdivision, but there was a real risk in being run over by cars. Kids living in suburbia had to be driven everywhere for activities.<p>It&#x27;s no coincidence that the kids growing up in that environment and coming into adulthood have increasingly moved to gentrified neighborhoods (the ones designed for walking). There has been a decline in buying cars. Whether that means allowing the kids to have free play remains to be seen. (But I suspect, things like the popularity of the books, <i>The Dangerous Book for Boys</i>, <i>The Daring Book for Girls</i> are indicative).",1379652962

I just don&#x27;t think it will catch-on with the gaming public for other reasons.  Look at how much resistance there was to Microsoft&#x27;s &#x27;always-on&#x27; feature of Xbox One, to the resistance to DRM that calls home (it is annoying if you&#x27;re trying to play a game somewhere that you have no connection), and then the requirement that the developer also maintain infrastructure.<p>The current system, where you create something native using a cross-platform toolkit, then distribute it once, and the user has it forever - this is what gamers are used to, and what they like.  And I admit, it&#x27;s nice being able to play games when I have no internet connection.  I don&#x27;t think this paradigm is necessarily the best one, but it certainly has its merits.",1379652821

6415972,comment,6413395,6413395,3,0,csense,,,"Since Android is an open system, would it be possible to write an app that runs on a phone and forces applications to batch transfers?<p>I&#x27;m thinking of a &quot;limiter&quot; app that runs locally on the phone, and disables TCP/IP transmissions every 18 minutes out of 20.  That way things like email you can still get relatively quickly, but the radio&#x27;s only on 10% of the time.<p>Developers and users both being aware of the problem and trying to fix it might mean their solutions collide.  E.g. a badly behaved app that tries to access the network once every 30 seconds will always get through during the 2-minute window, but a well-behaved app that only hits the internet every 10 minutes might miss the window entirely.<p>So maybe the limiter should intercept outgoing TCP/IP connections, lie to the initiating app and tell it the connection happened but the remote end isn&#x27;t sending any data, then connect the outgoing app to the real remote end when the radio switches on.  Of course if there&#x27;s an application-controlled timeout interval on the connection, it&#x27;ll trigger and the 10-minute-interval app would miss the window.<p>You might get around that problem by using whatever UNIX signal Ctrl+Z generates, to lock up an app entirely when it tries to open an outgoing connection, then resume it when the radio&#x27;s on.  Of course, this&#x27;ll probably lock the app&#x27;s UI too, so it&#x27;ll become totally unusable.  Although if the limiter acts like a screensaver and goes away whenever the user&#x27;s recently given any touch or keyboard input, that doesn&#x27;t really matter, does it?<p>Or maybe Google should make an API where an app can say, &quot;I want to make a connection, and I&#x27;m willing to wait if turning the radio on right now wouldn&#x27;t be good for the user.&quot;",1379652251

What kind of controller does the user have?) are on the person porting the emulator, not the developer.

6415888,comment,6413395,6414665,29,0,kevin_nisbet,,,"I just want to add in from a network carrier perspective.<p>I work for a mobile operator, and have had to work on several network issues related to poorly designed apps. I agree with kintamanimatt on this, it&#x27;s not premature optimization, you need to know the cost of what you&#x27;re doing. There is an incredible resource cost, to all the naive developers making apps these days, that treat the wireless interface as an always on connection.<p>1. Server polling every minute
We actually sent one customer an invoice for over $100,000 because they had a particularly bad application that polled a server every minute. This was only an internal app used by a few hundred people, but they used it at their office, and it caused constant blocking on the cell site covering their office. This actually broke cellular coverage near their office, and caused issues for all the other customers in the same area. Ultimately, we said, we can help you fix you&#x27;re app, you can pay the invoice to upgrade cell coverage to you&#x27;re office, or get off our network. In this instance, we helped them fix their app, so it only interacted with the server when something needed to be changed (the server pushed changes), which was actually quite easy to do. This simply isn&#x27;t the same thing, as writing an inner loop in assembly, to shave off a few microseconds in runtime, which would be premature optimization, and actually making robust software that works well wherever it is used.<p>2. Synchronized network access
This one has been the bane of us on a few occasions. If you write a network access to be like a cron entry, that run&#x27;s not only every 15 minutes, but does so at exactly the same time between all devices. We get to hunt you down, and scream, as our wireless network crumbles. When every device, wakes up at the same time, and asks for a higher power state, at exactly the same time, the network will only process so many. The funny thing is, you&#x27;ll test this yourself and not see anything, but then when you release your app, you might find 30% of those checks are failing for some reason, and struggle to figure out why. For any one who is thinking, well the operator should add more capacity, the answer is we do, but ultimately the customer pays for the network build.<p>3. High usage apps
What happens is, your device vendor, is in the interest of protecting it&#x27;s customers as well. We once had an app on our network, that would treat all reject codes, as a cause to retry. This caused it, to every time it was run, begin uploading data, over and over again, leading to thousands of dollars in bills to the customers for excessive data usage. The device vendor, pulled the app from their stores.<p>Now, how do you feel, about having to plead the case why you should be allowed to continue to sell your product, not only to the device vendor, but the carrier who found the problem, prove that you fixed it, have our bureaucracy test that you actually fixed it, and maybe if we feel like it, let you sell again. It&#x27;s not as simple as fix the bugs, you might actually lose you&#x27;re ability to make money of you&#x27;re software, for months while this get&#x27;s sorted out.<p>What do you think you&#x27;re store rating will be, when all your customers get sent a $5000 bill for using your app?<p>Now the question is, should there be a better way, and I&#x27;d like to see more from mobile vendors, in making it stupid easy to be smart about this. In the phone API&#x27;s, if I need to do a background update, I should be able to register with the OS, and say, I have an update to do, within the next 15 minutes, let me know when you have an active radio connection. You&#x27;re phone goes into a high powered radio connection, and bam, all you&#x27;re background updates now go out together. Need to send notifications, here is our push API, only interact with the mobile when an update needs to be done. If the API&#x27;s you&#x27;re using, are designed for mobile, and take alot of this network stuff that you shouldn&#x27;t need to know into account, it&#x27;s a lot easier for the naive developers to do better by blind luck.<p>--

It had been a fun experience. But it just stopped there. None of what I did was general enough to be reused. Then 3 months later, I tried docker again. I started to appreciate it.

6415866,comment,6414162,6414162,3,0,millstone,,,"> The power of multicore processors, vector units, and GPUs is being squandered by the industry because of an obsolete programming paradigm.<p>Its worth addressing these in turn. In reverse order:<p>I dispute that the C paradigm squanders GPUs. OpenCL and CUDA are the two most prominent languages written with GPUs in mind, and both have a lot more in common with C than with Haskell. In particular they eschew functional mainstays like recursion, linked lists, and garbage collection. So for GPUs, it seems like the ideal paradigm is closer to C than Haskell.<p>For vector units, theres some recent excitement about auto-vectorization in Haskell. But Im skeptical about the potential of auto-vectorization in general, since it only seems to apply to simple loops, and cant take advantage of all instructions. Most effectively vectorized code uses either compiler intrinsics or outright assembly, and I dont see that changing any time soon (Id love to be proven wrong on this though).<p>Lastly, multicore processors. C++11 more or less standardized the creaky POSIX threading model, with some additions like thread locals - hardly state of the art. I wonder if the author is familiar with other approaches, like libdispatch, which provide a much improved model.<p>One last observation. Parallelism is not a goal! Improved performance is the goal, and parallelism is one mechanism to improved performance. If your Haskell program runs at half the speed of a C++ program, but scales to twice as many cores so as to make the overall time equal, thats not a wash: its a significant win for C++, which did the same thing with half the resources (think battery drain, heat, other processes, etc.) Horse in front of cart.",1379650323

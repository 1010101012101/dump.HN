7456596,comment,7456540,7456540,27,0,Zigurd,,,"I was able to successfully train a designer to use the Android SDK&#x27;s tools when appropriate, and check in graphical assets. In preparatory meetings I insisted the designer be in the room with the coders and product managers as I explained how Android is different. I taught them all how to use conditional layouts and how to test apps for good practices by changing font sizes to see if they really are geometry-independent. Once they saw how easy it is to make other developers&#x27; work look less than competent, I could see the switch in their minds flip: They were not doing to be tripped up by users who change font size.<p>This client was the typical kind of client who could easily have fallen into a &quot;portitis&quot; pattern of not designing for the capabilities of Android&#x27;s layout system. If all parts of the system - product managers, coders, and designers, not have bought into thinking about their part of the project differently from an iOS implementation, the designers would have had no inputs from those other parts of the team re how they were modifying their approach for an Android version of their product.<p>Android has a richer system for adapting code modules to different layouts, and therefore a more sophisticated UX for tablets. It&#x27;s a pity than many Android apps are low-bidder porting jobs that plaster right over that.",1395633336

Since they use iOS devices themselves, it is their go to platform. It is almost always the one they want to work with.<p>Oddly, when I ask them why, the answers are mostly qualitative. It has nothing to do with &quot;reaching the most people&quot; or &quot;getting exposure&quot;. It&#x27;s a simple matter of taste. Designers tend to choose iOS products because they identify with them. They see Apple as an institution that they would enjoy being a part of in some way. Almost all the designers I know that are worth their salt use and love their macs for working in Photoshop and Illustrator, so it naturally follows that they prefer the iOS platform, regardless of numbers and market share.<p>Admittedly, my sample size is only around 50 or so, but this has been my experience.",1395633299

If that happens, all of a sudden there will be way fewer video or other high bandwidth startups, unless they&#x27;re lucky enough to get sufficient VC to pay off the cable companies. No new Dropboxes or Vimeos.<p>Also, I think this situation is fairly different than, say, Motorola manufacturing set-top boxes for cable companies.<p>The Apple boxes will be sold in retail stores directly to the consumer, and are an attempt by Apple to create a Netflix/Roku killer.

It hasn&#x27;t finished searching my mail yet, but if it turns out it names the photos based on the recipient etc. then I can just filter them myself...<p>Also, the app doesn&#x27;t have retina buttons. For most things this would be okay, but even the close/minimise/zoom window controls are pixelated! It&#x27;s a shame to have a photo-centric app look so poorly, especially when default controls would have fixed that. Edit: <i>Also</i>, the zoom doesn&#x27;t do anything! But it&#x27;s not greyed out, so suggests that it does. I actually like the interface, and have nothing against skeuomorphism per se, but it&#x27;s not cool when it breaks things...<p>Finally, a comment on heuristics: it was really cool to see the restrictions on small file size images and gifs, because that removes a load of emoticons, advertising etc. that otherwise would&#x27;ve added clutter. But additional heuristics would be nice, e.g. it&#x27;s found some images that are not photos for me. I imagine a simple test would be just counting the number of unique colours present in the image (though I don&#x27;t know how slow that would be): a lot of the images coming up that aren&#x27;t photos often have a few dozen colours max.<p>Otherwise very happy to have bought it :) Certainly saves me time doing it all myself by manually syncing everything with some mail client and then searching the attachments folder...",1395632796

I can&#x27;t say I was entirely naive, but I trusted them too much early on that they understood my concerns - they didn&#x27;t.<p>In this case, if you want 50 well-respected professors, you have to go out of your way to identify 100, then identify potential concerns (licensing issues with existing publishers and universities) and solve <i>that</i> problem.  Building a website for people to upload slideshows and movies is a solved problem (hundreds of times over).  Building a process to extract out valuable content from people who would otherwise not create digital content, then monetize that, that is <i>not</i> at all a solved problem, at least in many verticals.<p>Yes, someday, someone&#x27;s going to crack this.

You could argue that quicksort is best based on its O(n lg n) average running time. It is usually taught early on in CS programs as an example of a fast sorting algorithm. However, for small values of n you&#x27;re actually better off using a sorting algorithm with worse asymptotic performance that is better suited to your hardware. Good cache coherency can make a big difference and asymptotic running times can hide some pretty big constants. Quicksort also performs badly on sorted or nearly sorted lists. In these cases you end up hitting quicksort&#x27;s worst case performance of O(n^2).<p>You might have other constraints on your sorting algorithm. What if you wanted to sort twice and have ties in the second sort broken by the results of the first sort? You&#x27;d need to pick a stable sorting algorithm for your second sort. Someone else already mentioned in place sorting. If you have lots of items to sort but they are all relatively short you might find that a radix sort is fastest. You might not even really need to sort your items. If you just need to always be able to get the smallest or largest you could store your values in a heap.<p>To sum up, the best sorting algorithm will depend on your hardware, your data, and how you&#x27;re planning to use it.",1395631605

All scrum requires is that when adjustments are made (like cutting features in the face of an upcoming deadline), they are made according to an orderly process of prioritization that occurs during sprint planning and while grooming the backlog.<p>What agile buys you is early warning when inconsistent objectives emerge, so you can make adjustments well in advance instead of in a last-minute panic right before the deadline.

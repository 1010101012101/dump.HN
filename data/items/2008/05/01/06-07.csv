178174,comment,177987,177987,0,0,johnm,,,"That's <i>very</i> fishy.  They should give you all of the information in the plan because the details do matter when push comes to shove.  I.e., you want to know not just the currently outstanding shares but all of the authorized shares as well. This is important in judging whether or not they've boxed themselves in w.r.t. funding and valuation. I've been seeing more startups lately getting themselves into needlessly tough positions by not raising enough money early and so their pattern is set at too low a range for future rounds unless everything goes hockey stick.<p>If they give you any BS about you not needing that information then you should run away (and tell everybody about them).",1209623842

HR knows that CS PhDs will work for peanuts because they've had their financial self-esteem slowly beaten out of them over the past five years.

178171,comment,177995,177995,0,0,vlad,,,"I believe I have the computer you recommended, a work T61, and a Macbook Pro.  The keyboard on the MacBook Pro is much better, surprisingly.  The idea to use a backlit keyboard is incredibly thoughtful.  The screen is much, much better than the one on a T61.  The operating system is much better and simpler, with not a single picture or theme of a blue sky  that I know of.  The T61 wins in... looking Windowish.<p>In this case, both Windows XP and Vista computers look as unrefined and ancient right now as old Apple computers with 5.25"" drives do.  When I think of Windows I think of those documentaries about the Silicon Valley from the late 90's.",1209622986

After a few years, the salaries are much higher, but still under $150K. $130K plus options is pretty standard in the West Coast for an experienced developer with or without any degree. Seems to have jumped up some in the last couple years along with gas prices. Google, though, pays less.",1209622459

There's clearly more to it than that, because lots of industries have only one company with good aesthetic sense, yet almost none have fanboys.<p>Agreed on iRiver.

However, most of the good ones consist of a mix of published and unpublished works to ascertain whether there&#x27;s a real effect or whether there&#x27;s been a publishing bias that doesn&#x27;t reflect the total body of research. A good meta analysis will take the time to discuss their methods for selecting published works and any efforts they made to solicit unpublished works such as contacting prominent authors in the field, getting on mailing lists, etc. The good ones also tend to discuss how they analyzed the papers for selection, discuss the paper stats (i.e. we started with 200 published papers and 20 unpublished ones, after winnowing this got reduced to 130 published and 10 unpublished), and how they collapsed results to calculate effect sizes etc.<p>Meta analyses should include as much of the published literature as possible for the research question they&#x27;re attempting to answer AND they should seek out unpublished works. The meta analysis will consist primarily of published works, the unpublished works are collected to counter the presence of positive result publishing bias. This provides a fuller picture of the research field than simply relying on published works.

[A clarification: Wind Turbines generate electricity, Wind Mills mill flour. It&#x27;s a small but important detail.]<p>Operation & Maintenance expense is my biggest issue with new technology. I have met many design engineers that have never been inside of a nacelle or even visited a wind farm. In the real world generators and blades break, hurricanes, lightning, shit happens. Cranes are extremely expensive and a 2MW &quot;mast&quot; that can compete with today&#x27;s technology is going to be crazy tall. How to repair a lightning cable? Cranes are over $10k per day and cables take a few days to fix.<p>Today there is a 26 story ladder in the interior of the support tower that people climb up to fix hardware in the nacelle. To inspect the blades we then rig our anchors to the generator, pop out the top hatch and repel over the nose cone and down onto a blade in the &quot;down&quot; position. The only specialized hardware needed is anchors, carabiners, ropes, harness and helmet.<p>Vortex Bladeless would be impossible to inspect and repair using this method, yes drones are great for inspection, but what about repairing a stress crack on the tip? You would need a crazy tall crane that is even more expensive and with cranes the wind speeds need to be a fraction that of Industrial Rope Access. This means your available repair days are even less and the turbine has to be shut down for longer for the fix to occur.<p>I am all for new technology and crowd financing, but there are many practical obstacles this team needs to overcome in the design phase to build a product that can actually scale in the real world.<p>Also, feel free to AMA if you have specific wind turbine questions.",1431359761

In fact, it requires a certain way of thinking that not everyone possesses or has the desire to develop the skills in.<p>Excel, on the other hand, lets you bypass a lot of these issues with programming and get to results faster in some situations. First, it is completely visual. I don&#x27;t have to visualize the data, it&#x27;s right there in front of me. This reduces the cognitive load on the worker. Second, I can develop iteratively and see the results immediately. Yes, you can do this in programming, but any changes require a recompile-->execute-->look at the data process that Excel includes intuitively. Third, Excel is accessible. People don&#x27;t need to memorize syntax or commands, they can simply got to the formula finder and start typing in what they&#x27;re looking for and excel will load the formula for them.<p>Can you build amazing Excel programs/spreadsheets?

Even more so - they can be achived without changing the current spec of the language.<p>2) As I learned during this discussion there are &quot;comment directive convention&quot; that are older as go 1.4. I could imaging they play a role deep inside the go tooling. i.e. I could imaging that the cgo stuff has some deep roots. It would some work to change all occurences - that is glass clear - because even now there are legacy directives // +build //link that are not updated to the &quot;new convention&quot; //go: foo<p>3) I dont know about the internal mechanism that the go team needs to observce to change the spec of a language, that is perhaps in wide productive use within the google. But i can imagin there is procedure. Changing the spec meight just not be possible before Go 2.0 because of policy.<p>4) It meight not be desired to introduce something that smells like a macro language into the code. There meight be some animosity againt it - give the clean code philosopy that Go aimes for.<p>No, i dont realy believe that. I am Sorry to have accused! On contrary: The yacc tool gives great power to expand the language. But yacc is a heavy lifting tool and not something like a macro every one could use. Its also not part of the spec, just given as magic comment - no prommise made.<p>5) One counter argument that is invalid: I am pretty sure the go team cares about semantic. :-) All programmers do breath semantic. Of course there are different tastes.<p>6) You basicly cant prevent magic... in comments or otherwise its the reason its called magic.<p>7) those commented directives can stay in all levels of the build process - without adaptions of the spec.

Curation is the main part of it, as opposed to the Library, for example, where access is primary.<p>Museums collect artworks erratically. Often--and this was worse in the past, but there&#x27;s fallout today--in order to get the best works, they take many additional works from a donor. They never really wanted those other works, and simply to display them (or to offer them to other institutions/locations for display), without curatorial moderation, would shirk their most important responsibility, that of interpretation.<p>&quot;Curation&quot; is a word we started to use for lots of activities that are nowhere near the level of effort a professional art curator applies to the task. To ask a museum to display all those works without intense curatorial effort is a significantly bigger change than I think this author understands.<p>He should keep up the pressure, however. Lots of museums have, or are, putting their entire collections online, with pictures when they have them.

Link those blogs in their page, sponsor the post, targeting Nepalese working abroad.\n3.

In addition, it&#x27;s backwards incompatible due to anyone doing &#x27;reflect.TypeOf&#x27; which I guess you could argue is fine to break.<p>Speaking of reflection, there&#x27;s a metric <i>TON</i> of runtime panics in the reflect package.

It does not give me an opportunity to recover from bad input by passing an error out, it just panics.

They&#x27;re basically passing around strings with no builtin way to create a trace of errors to return up the stack to maybe be printed, no default way to create an optional type with an error value, and no consistent way to determine which of N errors it was that was returned from a function without using a regexp 90% of the time because that damned fmt.Errorf / errors.New...

All that is required is generally the absence of consent for the specific act. If she has said &quot;no&quot; or had diminished capacity to object or consent (e.g. been drunk or asleep), then you generally don&#x27;t have consent.<p>In this case part of the allegation is in one instance that the woman was &quot;half asleep&quot; (potentially unable to provide consent, though in this case the defence will want to question exactly what is meant by &quot;half asleep&quot; in the statement), and secondly that consent had previously given for intercourse with a condom and that it been made very clear to Assange there was no consent to sex without a condom, but that Assange allegedly intentionally sabotaged a condom (if he did, then that would be a crime in a whole range of countries).<p>If those allegations are true as they have been presented, then it would be some form of sexual offence pretty much everywhere, whether rape or sexual assault.<p>Of course we don&#x27;t know if they are true, or even if they accurately represents what the women told police.<p>>  You can&#x27;t decide a sexual intercourse was actually rape some days after the fact;<p>No, but you can decide you need to report it days after the fact. While a delay in reporting a rape is often used as an argument by the defence in rape cases, it is fairly common for rape victims to take their times to come forward.<p>More importantly in this case the alleged victims allegedly did not report a rape but went to police to ask if they could compel an STI test, and the <i>police</i> started a rape investigation on the basis that the details as described by the women allegedly meets the standard of sexual offences under Swedish law.<p>> The rapist and the victim generally don&#x27;t part in good terms as apparently happened in this case.<p>Victims often continue to <i>live with</i> rapists for years. Or date them. Or work with them. To those around them it can often perfectly well look like they&#x27;re on good terms. This is part of the reason why rapes are so hard to prosecute, because so often it devolves to a &quot;he said, she said&quot; where the way the victim have acted is hard to understand for juries.<p>Assange may very well be not guilty, but I don&#x27;t think any of this remotely rules out that he might be guilty.",1431356736

When handling min/max, they had a few options:<p>1) Treat numbers as a special case and have a polymorphic min/max that operates on any number type. This is out of the question because it is obtuse and irregular and neither of those things are the &quot;Go way&quot;<p>2) Properly abstract over numbers somehow. This can be weakly done using Go interfaces but 1) it would require >, < etc to all be methods on the number types. But then Go would need operator overloading and that&#x27;s not the &quot;Go way&quot; 2) using an interface is actually bad anyways because it doesn&#x27;t make guarantees that input type =:= output type. To do that you need proper generics and then use a common subtype or take it further and use a Numeric typeclass. This is way too complicated and not the &quot;Go way&quot;<p>3) Write a min/max for every number type. Due to lack of overloading, each would be named accordingly (minInt64 etc).

I took the parent comment to mean that talking narrowly about &quot;FP&quot; as programming with pure functions isn&#x27;t very useful any more. It may have made sense in the 90s when few widely-used languages had h.o.f, but that fight has pretty much been won.<p>The field that gave rise to FP has a lot to say about how we specify languages and their properties and how we prove things about programs in general. That includes languages with all kinds of effects: state, exceptions, concurrency, etc, and equally as imporant, mechanisms for abstraction and modularity. There&#x27;s currently no other &quot;foundation&quot; for computation that lets us define these ideas formally.<p>In discussions of FP, the contributions of the field get reduced to &quot;programming with functions&quot;.",1431356487

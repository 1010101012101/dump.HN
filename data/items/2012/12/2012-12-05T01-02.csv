I think this is technically possible by submitting an armv7s-only binary, but I don't see why <i>anyone</i> would do that. Except maybe to sell ""I am rich 2"".<p>Requiring iOS6 I can understand, because for phone-only apps, you can target almost the same devices as with iOS5 (minus iPod 3G and people who do not want to update, for e.g. performance reasons).",1354672778

From page 12,<p><i>HFT encompasses not simply and not even directly the speed of trading..., but rather stands in for the general automation of trading....</i><p><i>HFT may be better understood as the name for the suite of effects that computerization has had on the worlds of securities trading.  There is little controversy about this picture within the trading world, including both trading firms themselves and the government bodies that regulate them.</i><p>In fact, there is an incredible amount of controversy surrounding this point.  According to a CFTC committee [1]:<p><i>Specifically, the Commission stated that HFT was a form of automated trading that employs: (a)algorithms for decision making, order initiation, generation, routing, or execution, for each individual transaction without human direction; (b)low-latency technology that is designed to minimize response times, including proximity and co-location services; (c)high speed connections to markets for order entry; and (d)recurring high message rates (orders, quotes or cancellations) determined using one or more objective forms of measurement, including cancel-to-fill ratios.</i><p><i>Any definition of HFT should acknowledge that various types of Automated Trading can exhibit mechanical characteristics of HFT, the commission noted. However, for automated trading to be considered HFT it needs to match the cumulative criteria that comprises the definition, including recurring high message rates determined using one or more objective forms of measurement.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.securitiestechnologymonitor.com/news/hft-defined-by-cftc-as-subset-of-automated-trading-31398-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.securitiestechnologymonitor.com/news/hft-defined-...</a>",1354672149

The general rule holds for most softwares with 'manufacturing' replaced by user appreciation.<p>The hidden cost of taking manufacturing offshore is that a GREAT deal of industrial knowledge is lost.

We're not talking high school dropouts either: among the tasks given to the production workers is redesigning from scratch products which use impractical and inefficient designs, at least according to the scenario explained in the article. The article also points out that these are lines where there are not many workers per line.<p>My own thoughts about the market were piqued by the description of the chosen product. Here we have an electric heat pump heater that costs over $1300. This is right at a time when running an electric heater, even an exceptionally efficient one, has become a poor choice given the price of gas. Furthermore, gas is very likely to remain cheaper than electric for many years. Not to mention that gas heaters are simply more efficient for heating to begin with. Rather than buy an $1600 chinese or $1300 american water heater, one can buy a $150 mexican factory built water heater that runs on gas and will save many thousands of dollars in energy costs over its lifetime. That's the rational choice, it is unlikely this complicated electric one is going to be something with a lot of market growth. Hopefully there are better examples of high growth reasonably priced mass market items that can be built as well, which have a chance at creating more than a handful of these $13.50 jobs (comparable to the salary at CostCo or McDonalds, BTW).<p>For water heating one could also do what I did - use $50 worth of materials and junk to build your own solar water heater that reduces the cost of water heating to almost nothing.

4874381,comment,4873542,4873542,4,0,DigitalSea,,,"This was a really interesting article. It's interesting the misconceptions that some people have about outsourcing and the perception that it's cheaper. When you factor in transport, the price of oil and rising cost of living everywhere in the world (especially China) it makes sense that less reliance on petroleum and outsourced labour actually works out better in the end. It was once standard for products to say Made in the U.S.A and then the outsourcing boom kicked in and people got used to Made in China for electronics or Made in Indonesia for a lot of shoe-wear. Buying a product made in your own country is currently considered a premium product purchase. For example buying a hand-wired guitar amplifier or even hand-made guitar that is built in the U.S commands a much higher price and some are happy paying it because the quality is considerably higher, attention to detail and intricacies like soldering and component placement.<p>I would really love to see the manufacturing world return to the mantra of, ""this needs to be designed and built to last as long as possible"", it won't happen but it would be nice to live in a world again where the best components and design decisions are made with the consumer in mind, not lining the pockets of CEO's. Once upon a time companies created products that lasted forever, I've seen televisions from the 50's with original picture tubes and components still working.<p>It's good to hear General Electric (a company I am not overly fond of) have started manufacturing products back in the United States again.

Basically what I want to say is that <ul> (probably a particular subset of <ul>s, specified by selector combinators) should be styled like a .btn-group.  That is the behaviour I'd naively expect, and is certainly the behaviour I want.  However it can be done [3].<p>Also, in SASS, you would use selector inheritance -- `ul {@extend .btn-group}` -- which would compile to `ul, .btn-group {...}` and not bloat the output CSS... if it worked at all.<p>But something either in the design of Bootstrap's LESS (and carried over into the bootstrap-sass port), or in some inherent limitations of LESS/SASS, prevents this.

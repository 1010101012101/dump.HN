If someone sends me a check, and I deposit it, within a day or two I know the money is mine and can't be yanked back.<p>Furthermore, they don't make it obvious that they'll do this. It's yet another ""gotcha."" As another commenter noted, Paypal is great, right up to the point you have a problem, at which point they're terrible to me.<p>No company is more indicative of the power of Metcalfe's law than this one: that another, less jerky company hasn't superseded them is amazing.",1283705821

""Oh, I made millions, then immediately connected with with real people by working the grind at McDonald's."" BS. No way, did he make any kind of connection in that amount of time other than the ability to score interviews with that ""intriguing"" introduction.<p>He does have interesting things to say in the interview, but you can tell the McDonald's thing was relatively meaningless to him. Now, had he done it for a year and lived solely off the wages from working shifts at McDonald's that would be something that likely would have provided a real connection for him.

When you move beyond safely coordinating mutation of shared resources there are many other headaches that can pop up, like priority inversion issues, lock ordering problems, etc.<p>Atomic operations are not a panacea either. Lock free data structures are very difficult to write correctly and the performance benefits associated with using atomics can start to evaporate when there is contention between multiple threads. There are also numerous subtle problems that can arise, from data visibility problems when modifying an unaligned address on multi-socket x86 platforms to ABA problems.<p>The easiest to write, and safest, multithreaded code is that which shares no state. Saying that atomic operations are the way to go is like saying NoSQL is the way to go, they are useful for a subset of problems but in general they are the wrong level at which to be thinking when approaching concurrency.",1283704970

In many disciplines everything is shared a year in advance via working papers.  These are often posted on authors webpages or on conference pages before anywhere with a formal rss feed.  I want to subscribe to specific authors and be confident I get things first.<p>This will be hard to do well and while the CPM might be great for some categories, it's a niche product.

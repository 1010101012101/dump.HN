4599789,comment,4599232,4599590,6,0,Jach,,,"Language affects matters here, I think. I haven't met a Python programmer who doesn't love dictionaries, but I've seen C programmers (and to an extent, C++ programmers where 'std::map' is a red black tree) that avoid them because they have to roll their own or find and trust (and learn how to use) someone else's. Java programmers are more mixed. When the language forces you if you want to have nested hash tables to write ""Map<String, Map<String, Map<String, Map<String, String>>> > meta_data = new HashMap<String, Map<String, Map<String, Map<String, String>>> >();"" instead of ""meta_data = {}"", it's a pretty strong incentive to not use these things.",1349132344

I'm a fairly experienced developer, but this current project is pushing me beyond my limits.<p>Its already launched and for a multinational client. The client is in 40+ countries and they want to consolidate their brand image by unifying their subsidiary websites into one cohesive website. The standard ""big company"" deal where you are geolocated and automatically sent to a subsite for your culture like ea.com, except /en_UK/, or /en_US/ instead of just /en/.
Each subsite will be partially manageable by all the countries (for country specific news, etc), but the majority (90%) of the content will be managed by parent company.
Each country will have an optional shop system, which is integrated into the website, but some shop data such as product names, images, will be managed by the parent company.<p>Also, because of the design they have clicking on a link and going to an external shop solution or changing to a different url is not an option, and sites/sites-with-shops have to reside within these sub directories integrated into an amazing design(the Graphic Designer is great) but is not something that is easily implemented in any CMS I know of. (I'm talking lots of js/AJAX calls).
Another problem, is that all this must be integrated with legacy databases, and different countries current shop systems etc. I've already built the site and launched in a couple countries, and everything works fine, its secure, and fills the requirements. But I'm having difficulty managing this as one person already and more sites are just going to come (a lot more). Since everything is already built and all the problems (implementation not content management) have been solved, I rebuilding would be fairely quick, and I do have a break now. I apologize for the length and look forward to any helpful advice you can give",1349131891

4599742,comment,4597716,4599580,21,0,btilly,,,"I love how everyone is an instant expert on the Internet, even if they have only heard of the issue minutes before.  I'm not a random internet conspiracist.  I'm an established member of this community reporting what happened to someone that I considered a friend at the time that it happened.<p>Here is the story as I remember it.<p>The private lawsuit that Ed Curry had standing to bring was a complex contract violation between himself and Microsoft.  The fact that Microsoft was not carrying through with their obligations left Ed Curry with very poor personal finances.  Therefore any lawyer who took the case on would be doing so on contingency.  No matter how many other lawsuits may have been filed, it is not a particularly easy matter to find a lawyer who is willing to spend years in a private lawsuit against pockets as deep as Microsoft's in the hope that someday, maybe, you'll get a big enough settlement to justify it.<p>So what were Ed Curry's other options?<p>Well he was aware that Microsoft was breaking the law in a rather egregious way.  Windows NT 3.5.0 service pack 3 had a C2 certification.  Ed knew this, he is the person who had done that security evaluation.  (Which he did on the very contract that Microsoft was breaking the terms on.)<p>However Microsoft was advertising that Windows NT 4.0 had a C2 clearance.  And was selling that into government departments whose regulations required that clearance.  Ed Curry was aware of the false advertising, and the lack of clearance, and was furthermore aware that major design decisions, such as putting third party graphics drivers into ring 0, made the attack surface against Windows NT 4.0 sufficiently large that it could not qualify for C2 certification.  (Historical note, Windows NT 4.0 never got that certification.  But many years later, on service pack 6, they got a British certification that they claimed was equivalent.)<p>But what could he do about that?  Microsoft was clearly breaking the law.  But as a private individual, Ed did not have standing to sue Microsoft for the false advertising.  He's not the wronged party, you need someone like the attorney general to sue.  But Microsoft was politically connected, and getting those people interested is difficult.<p>What Ed decided to do - in retrospect it was clearly a mistake - was to go public with Microsoft's lawbreaking in the hope that he could get the attention of someone sufficiently highly placed to force Microsoft to follow the law.  That's when Microsoft went nuclear.  They paid every one of his clients to go elsewhere.  After his company went bankrupt, when he got a job they paid that company to preemptively fire him.  After several months of this, he died of a heart attack.<p>Incidentally you may wonder why Microsoft broke their contract with him in the first place.  The reason was simple.  They came to him with NT 4.0, and said that they wanted C2 clearance.  He came back and said that it would never pass, and explained why.  They told him to lie so that they could get the certification.  When he refused to lie, they decided that they would punish him for failing to cooperate, and decided to not live up to their side of the agreement, safe in the knowledge that he was not going to have a reasonable chance of successfully suing them for it.<p>That's what happened, and I don't much care whether you happen to believe it.  I was there, you weren't, and people who are active on HN will make up their own minds about me.",1349131593

4599740,comment,4599232,4599232,25,0,antirez,,,"Inside the Redis distribution you can find ""dict.c"" that is a very easy to understand hash table implementation that uses incremental rehashing, that is, when it needs to switch to a bigger or smaller table this happens incrementally in three ways:<p>1) At every operation you perform there is a rehashing step.<p>2) You have a function that you can call to perform a rehashing step.<p>3) There is an higher level function where you can say ""rehash for N milliseconds"" in case you have some idle time to spend for a good cause inside your program.<p>Another uncommon thing of dict.c is that it supports the ""pick a random element"" operation with guaranteed O(1) behaviour.<p>EDIT: Now that I look at the source, clearly while the code is easy to follow a design section should be present in the dict.c top-comment. I'll make sure to add this, but long story short:<p>* We use both chaining and incremental rehashing. This means that there is no need to rehash ASAP when the hash table reached the max % of elements allowed. At the same time using the incremental rehashing there is no need to block.<p>* We support safe and unsafe iterators: safe iterators block the rehashing when they are active, so you have the feeling you are accessing the hash table in a read-only way. Unsafe iterators are ok for looping even while an incremental rehashing is in progress, but is not ok to touch the hash table while iterating with an unsafe iterator (otherwise the iterator no longer guarantees to return all the elements, or to avoid duplicated elements).<p>* The hash table is rehashed both ways: if it's too full, or if it's too empty. This way there is the guarantee that a table has always a percentage between a min and max. This guarantees that our random element function is in the average case O(1).<p>* When we rehash, a second table is created, and stuff are moved incrementally from one to the other. When we have two tables, all the lookup / delete operations are run against both the table as the element can be in the old or in the new table. Instead insertions only happen in the new table.<p>Well these are the main ideas I think.",1349131585

All credit for finding this snafu goes to gentmatt, and my bank account for allowing me the ability to frivolously buy a domain.<p>I don't believe that accessing this domain is built directly into the compiled code of apps, since (in my opinion) it did not happen close enough to a software update. I believe it is just some kind of a typo (bogus.apple.com?) for something used as part of the web page views that comprise the iTunes and the Mac App Store apps. I fully expect that this problem will quietly go away once they deploy new versions.<p>I picked up the domain just to see if any particularly exciting web requests were being made, and it's been fun to watch user agents, but as soon as Twitter, news sites, and forums got wind of it, it's pretty much impossible for me to discern any meaningful traffic anymore.<p>I suppose I could start filtering any requests with a referer, or ones not coming from *.apple.com.

The hashing algorithm should minimize collisions as much as possible.<p>Yes, the worst case running time is linear.  However, assuming a properly defined hashing function, it's practically a linear running time over the expected number of collisions per bucket, which should be a tiny fraction of the total expected data size.<p>The problem that the second gives us is that proper hash algorithms are tailored to the specific problem at hand.

Hacker News has great content and a lot of great posters, but it also has this atmosphere of constantly trying to make yourself look as smart and perfect as possible, taking yourself way too seriously, and most importantly selling yourself/your startup at any opportunity.",1349129116

  between YouTube and the CableTV providers is bandwidth.

  If Google cracks the bandwidth nut, they can essentially replace TimeWarner, 
  Comcast, etc. in one fell swoop because they can easily replace 100% of the 
  services those companies offer at a fraction of the cost.

If you couldn't find someone to sue them that year, I'm afraid you don't have much credibility.<p>And this made my head hurt:<p>""All computer security systems begin with the Intel processor itself,"" Curry said.

In my opinion it's great piece of software as long, as you don't want to share your code with anyone out there (beside your teammates).

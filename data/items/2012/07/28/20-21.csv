Many software vendors - and Apple is definitely one of the most prominent in this regard - think that if they need to store user data, it's completely OK to store it in undocumented non-standard way without any possibility of export. Of course, that enhances vendor lock-in, so why not? But the users should be aware that inevitably will lead to stories like this - my software vendor screwed me over and I have no way to recover my data now! Fortunately, in this case there were third-party tool that were able to export the data - but in many cases the same vendor would fight tooth and nail with such tool vendors to shut them down for ""copyright"", ""patent protection"" and whatever else reasons.",1343509108

4306453,comment,4305732,4306288,7,0,nostrademons,,,"Google was the effect, it wasn't the cause.<p>Basically, the cause was my startup.  It'd been my dream to found my own company since I was about 15 years old, then the stars aligned when I was about 25.  I had a cofounder that was very into the idea, my previous skillset was a good match, I had money in the bank to fund myself, and my parents were supportive.  So I went full-time & full-speed on it, thinking ""This is it.  I'm going to make my dreams come true.""<p>The honeymoon lasted for about 2-3 months, and then I realized I was miserable - miserable enough to feel my sanity fraying, in fact.  I was doing basically nothing but coding, and it felt incredibly lonely & isolating.  I thought that was exactly what I <i>wanted</i> to be doing, but...apparently not.<p>Google came around through an incredibly random series of chance meetings.  I decided my startup wasn't going anywhere in Jun 2008 (my cofounder had quit in April to go to business school), when a YC startup contacted me looking for a cofounder.  They ended up offering me 25% of the company, and that was when I knew I wasn't ready to be a cofounder - here was everything I'd dreamed of, and I just couldn't do it.  Applied to FriendFeed, but was rejected, then figured maybe I shouldn't discount big companies - after all, virtually all of FriendFeed's team cut their teeth at a big company (mostly Google).  Talked with a friend at EBay that summer just to get a sense what life at a big company is like, it didn't seem too terrible.  TipJoy contacted me about being their employee #1 right around the time of Sequoia's ""The sky is falling"" memo, which I actually entertained serious thoughts about (I liked the founders), but I was like ""I need to see what else is out there"".  Ended up being referred to Google by a friend from the HP fandom, and started there in no small part because they were the only ones hiring.<p>The irony is - I went to Google thinking that my dreams of having a big impact on the world were completely on hold, but at least I'd have weekends again and would probably learn a whole lot.  But the more I relaxed and stopped worrying about making a big impact, the bigger my impact actually became.  There was a time, shortly after the visual redesign, where I started reverting to my previous lone wolf attitude and started a couple projects all at my own initiation, where I was the sole/primary developer.  Both were canceled, and many of my other 20% projects never went anywhere.  When I started asking around about what else was going on at the Googleplex, I ended up as an early engineer for Google's Authorship efforts (which at that point was nothing more than a dream), and consulting for the visual redesign of 2011, and doing a few of the homepage doodles.  I never planned to be a part of the GFiber launch; I had other plans going on at the time, but they needed an engineer, and it seemed cool, so I just dropped my plans and volunteered to help out.<p>I'm still not all the way there yet - I still have occasional dreams of doing something great and want to just work all night to force my vision through.  I suspect that if I could <i>actually</i> banish them, and accept what I am as completely enough even if I never accomplished another thing in my life, I'd be ready to found my next startup.<p>So, if you don't work for Google or Twitter but want to be a part of cool things, I'd start by keeping your eyes open for cool things.  Ignore the tech press; they're usually the last to know about anything cool, and they usually go for the appearance of cool over actual coolness.  Judge with your own eyes.  Look for offhand mentions on forums, and then follow-up and research anything you see where you don't know what it is.  (I found FictionAlley this way - a bunch of people were dissatisfied with fanfiction.net closing their forums in the summer of 2001, and said ""We can do better"", and a bunch of the writers I followed started mentioning them in review threads.  I found Lisp and Haskell this way too, Lisp off Paul Graham's writings and Haskell because comp.lang.lisp dismissed it as just another ""weird language"").  If you have a pain point in your own life or your friends' lives, go search online to see if anyone is working on solving it, and if they are but it's not quite there yet, offer to help.  Most people love offers to help on their projects.",1343508148

It could be that there were other similar options the standards committee could have selected but with Samsung in the room the choice with the Samsung patent was made so all implementers need a license.<p>Big companies often want to get their technology into the standard as that enables them to get a small per unit license fee across large numbers of devices.

4306433,comment,4306132,4306132,1,0,bherms,,,"While many people may be bemoaning the choice of Mozilla to update without consent, I suggest looking at it from a different perspective...<p>Many browser updates are largely brought about due to a few things, but security is generally a large matter when these upgrades get pushed.  Yes, you may have kept a certain version for a reason (you don't want to change, you like the way it looks, etc), but let's focus on the other side of this with a short analogy.  Say you go out and buy a new fire alarm and install it at your house.  The fire alarm is there to help protect you from dying in a fire.  Later, the manufacturing company realizes there are some minor design flaws which put you at risk of, well, dying in a fire.  Most would argue that it is not only the duty and obligation of the company to replace (or upgrade) the alarm, but that it may even be right to legally mandate that they do.  If the company came to you and said that there were some major flaws and they wanted to upgrade you, I doubt anyone would whine that they like the way the current model looks and want to pass.<p>However, when a browser does it, everyone bitches about it.  The updates are there for many reasons, not just security.  Generally speaking, however, browser updates not only benefit your own security, but also help make the web a better place for everyone, whether it be by better standards adherence, improved usability tools, or who knows what else.<p>One of the big reasons that this becomes a problem is that people dislike change, but on a larger scale, they dislike change of something they don't understand.  Browsers, computers, the web, etc are very abstracted away from people to a point that most don't know anything about the way the tools they use on a daily basis work.  When those tools change, it appears like some corporate robot is changing it to hurt them because they don't understand the reasons these things NEED to be updated.  There isn't enough transparency on WHY the changes happen (there are in the changelogs, but try to get your mother to read or understand that) and understanding of the base layers and it makes it very hard for people to understand.<p>I think one step forward here is to present users with a laymans explanation on why they need to update their browser.  Telling them ""We need to update your browser because we've discovered a potential problem where someone could possibly steal your credit card number while making purchases"" is a lot more straightforward than this: <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/13.0.1/releasenotes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/13.0.1/releasenotes/</a>",1343507740

S/he claims to be purposely keeping that version, and so presumably has some good reason - specific plugins, specific version testing for an internal web application, etc. Even if przemoc didn't have what you would consider a good reason, it should be his or her choice to keep that browser version and the onus is on us as web developers to encourage him (in positive ways) to upgrade - through better web applications that require new features, better communicating the reasons for upgrading, etc.<p>Believe me when I say that I understand the frustrations that come from having to support outdated browsers - I used to develop a web application for the financial industry, where as of a year or two ago a significant portion of traffic still came from IE6-locked machines in large financial institutions - but browser choice is not the issue here.<p>The issue as I see it is that the software that przemoc was running did not behave as he or she wanted and expected it to behave. That means that the software had a design problem (poor or misleading auto-update setting design), a communication problem (didn't inform him or maybe mislead him about the default update behavior) or a bug (updated despite a setting telling it not to).<p>There isn't enough information in the original post to determine if the last one (auto-update occurring despite being turned off) is what happened here - I'd like to learn more. It would be worrying (and I'd argue an insecure design) if the software were even capable of self-updating with that setting turned off.",1343506330

4306365,comment,4306132,4306132,3,0,bpatrianakos,,,"As of the time of this comment a lot of people are missing the point which is about respecting the user's choice not to upgrade.<p>To answer the question though, I'd say maybe not the only one but you're probably part of an incredibly small minority. If you had the update feature off and this happened then it's certainly not right but if it was on and you received many notices already then you had plenty of time to turn that feature off.<p>I'd ask what reason anyone would have to keep such an old version though? I do understand its a choice but outside of some really narrow edge cases I can't really see a good reason to keep 3.6.<p>This raises so,e very interesting questions though if in fact you had the update feature explicitly turned off. We all can agree that updating your browser even somewhat regularly is great for both users and developers but respecting the users choices is also almost a duty that software developers have. To me this is a gray area. Considering how old and outdated FF3.6 is and that web standards change so rapidly and have a lot since 3.6 was it a good call for Mozilla to pull the trigger and upgrade users of ancient FF versions or is it more important to respect the user's choice?<p>I think they made the right call. We think of using a particular browser at version X as a choice but in reality the majority of people do not choose this. They get whatever came out at the time and then never think of it again. For most users their inaction when it comes to upgrading isn't really a conscious choice to stay at the version they have but instead just a side effect of not knowing enough to be able to choose to upgrade or not having the time to be bothered by the prompt and clicking ""No"" on whatever comes up (I can see that especially applying to Windows users as there seems to be a prompt popping up every other second). At a certain point there are so few reasons not to upgrade that it makes sense to do it for the user automatically. Even if a user, somehow, some way, is using an old version of FF for testing a website in development or has somehow gotten into a situation like many corporate IE users face where certain websites or apps can only be access with version X it's very reasonable to assume these people know they have an edge case and would take steps to either only run the browser on an intranet or private network or, for developers, only run it on one machine on a <i>local</i> server and not connected to the wider web.<p>In the end I feel for you and I understand it sucks but really there's not much reason at all for anyone not in that situation to be outraged or care much that a version of FF so out of date is being auto updated without permission. And I say that in the nicest way possible.",1343506084

That would explain a lot. I guess what I enjoyed about them is that they cut down on a lot of boilerplate.<p>In javascript, passing in an anonymous function, you have to explicitly name the arguments. So you've got something like:<p>map(function(item) {item + 2}, list))<p>In Clojure you can gut that down to:<p>(map #(+ % 2) lst)<p>This isn't that useful for small code snippets, but if you reuse that variable many times, or use multiple variables such as map-indexed, that %, %2, and so on syntax is really friendly.

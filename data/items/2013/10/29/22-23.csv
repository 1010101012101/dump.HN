They have every incentive to always have a passenger in the car.

6638107,comment,6637915,6638049,3,0,derefr,,,"> Basically, the JS crypto is reducible to the strength of the SSL connection. Anyone on the other end of the SSL connection, or anyone who can break the SSL connection, can get your plaintext. This makes the JS crypto nothing but overhead. It&#x27;s just hand-waving at that point.<p>This is true. However, you can say the same thing about, for example, retrieving an ISO of Ubuntu. A cryptosystem is as weak as its weakest link, and that weakest link may of course be the way you downloaded the cryptosystem in the first place.<p>But once the cryptosystem is <i>in place</i>, you don&#x27;t have to trust SSL <i>any more</i>. By default, webapps are always retrieved from the server for every new session, but application manifests and offline storage are an effective means of avoiding this. You can build a webapp that is only ever downloaded once, and from then on loads its own code from the filesystem; and which verifies new &quot;releases&quot; of its own source using whatever crypto it likes before overwriting the client-side stored copies of itself.<p>Neither Lavabit nor Hushmail implemented this sort of application-release policy, but they easily could have.",1383087299

Of course you&#x27;re going to miss some, some of the time. Human errors happen, and good languages help us deal with them.<p>Also, every time you pull code from another repository, function signatures all over the place change. Some of those may be functions your currently edited code is calling. This means every little divergence requires reviewing every single signature change or cryptic bugs will result.<p>> and will result in runtime bugs in any dynamic language.<p>It will result in runtime <i>errors</i> in dynamic languages. Errors that are visible, and difficult to ignore. That means the code gets fixed. UT triggers it trivially.<p>Whereas with Javascript, even code under UT can easily pass accidentally when wrong numbers of arguments are used.<p>This Dijkstra quote is relevant:<p>> It was a significant improvement that now many a silly mistake did result in an error message instead of in an erroneous answer. (And even this improvement wasn&#x27;t universally appreciated: some people found error messages they couldn&#x27;t ignore more annoying than wrong results, and, when judging the relative merits of programming languages, some still seem to equate &quot;the ease of programming&quot; with the ease of making undetected mistakes.)<p>> If you require X number of args, then assert that they aren&#x27;t undefined<p>That captures half of the bugs (too few arguments), for a large overhead (an extra line for almost every argument in every function).<p>> If you presume callers pass in X number of args in a variable args language, and then change the required args, you&#x27;re the bug, not the language<p>Every time you change code, there is potential to insert bugs.

This article mentions end-to-end encrypted messaging, for instance, which provides the nice property that not even the messaging server can read the message contents.<p>The problem with webapp-based javascript cryptography is that if the crypto code is delivered by the server, then the client is back to trusting the server.  The server operator, an attacker who can compromise the server, or an attacker who can compromise the SSL connection from the browser to the server can modify the JS to spray plaintext wherever they&#x27;d like.<p>Basically, the JS crypto is reducible to the strength of the SSL connection.  Anyone on the other end of the SSL connection, or anyone who can break the SSL connection, can get your plaintext.  This makes the JS crypto nothing but overhead.  It&#x27;s just hand-waving at that point.<p>This is not a theoretical weakness.  This is exactly happened to both Lavabit and Hushmail.

6637997,comment,6636811,6637490,0,0,bradyd,,,"> You drive the rear wheel drive V8 that weighs 2x my car&#x27;s weight<p>Actually, a lot of newer cars weigh more, not the other way around. I believe that this is mostly due to additional safety devices. For example a 1967 Mustang weighs 2500-3000 lbs[1], while a 2014 Mustang is 3500-3700 lbs[2]. A 2014 Toyota Prius is 3000 lbs[3], while a 2014 Corolla weights 2800 lbs[4]. A 1980 Corolla weighed 2000 lbs[5]. As you see, that rear wheel drive V8 weighs the same as the Prius. I think the improvements in MPG mostly come from improvements in engine efficiencies, not weight savings. I don&#x27;t know what kind of car you drive, but I&#x27;d be surprised if it only weighs 1500 lbs.<p>That being said, I mostly agree with your other points.<p>[1] <a href=""http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1967-1968-ford-mustang-specifications.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1967-1968-ford-mustang-specifi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.motortrend.com/cars/2014/ford/mustang/specifications/exterior.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motortrend.com/cars/2014/ford/mustang/specificati...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/prius/features.html#!/weights_capacities/1223/1225/1227/1229"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toyota.com/prius/features.html#!/weights_capaciti...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/corolla/features.html#!/weights_capacities/1832/1856/1876/1866"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toyota.com/corolla/features.html#!/weights_capaci...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.ultimatespecs.com/car-specs/Toyota/5260/Toyota-Corolla-IV-4d-Sedan-16.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ultimatespecs.com/car-specs/Toyota/5260/Toyota-Co...</a>",1383086236

I just wanted to leave a quick note and clarify that this MongoHQ security breach was the method used to obtain our users&#x27; access tokens, which led to the wave of spam on Saturday.<p>This is a key final piece of our investigation which brings it back full circle. I&#x27;m very happy that we have been able to gain the full understanding and can be confident there is no backdoor.<p>I want to be clear that this is still our fault. If access tokens were encrypted (which they are now) then this would have been avoided. In addition, MongoHQ have provided great insights and have much more logging in place than we have ourselves. Were also increasing logging significantly as a result.<p>I&#x27;ve updated our security breach blog post with this information.

Now, here is a crazy idea: The burgercare just got passed, everybody was hoping for lower burger premiums, but instead they doubled - in fact co-pay at the restaurant went up as well! Anger, confusion. Now imagine, people find a way to look at the actual cost of a burger, maybe by looking at some restaurants that show their prices. People dump burgercare and rather pay directly - at least for the triple mac to save money. they find small restaurants that sell them burgers directly without burgercare. they find out that they won&#x27;t be penalized if they don&#x27;t sign up for burgercare as long as their tax witholdings are near zero.

If I may, I&#x27;d like to share how I use mine, so that you might perhaps find them more useful in your own work.  I have dual monitors, and four virtual desktops (in XFCE, but that doesn&#x27;t matter).<p>Originally, I used only two workspaces (email/reading, development), and this has evolved a bit over time into 4. What I like about using virtual desktops is that I have a spatial mental model of where each thing is, which helps me ensure I don&#x27;t mix up dev/production, and helps me avoid alt-tabbing to find what I want. I make extensive use of my window manager&#x27;s ability to maximize on the left or right half of a screen.  (This would probably not work well for me with a single monitor, unless it were a large one.)<p>1: E-mail/calendar on the left monitor, automated build system output on the right.  This is for things that are semi-important but which I don&#x27;t want to regularly have interrupting me.<p>2: Web browser with the app I currently am developing, and my console window on the left monitor, full-screen IDE (PyCharm) on the right.  (I also put emacs or a terminal on the right as well when writing extensively in those.)  This workspace is where I spend more than 80% of my time.<p>3: Github on the right screen, for pull requests, code review, issue tracking.  I use this for a context-switch from <i>developing</i> code to <i>reviewing</i> it.  I&#x27;ll also use this workspace when babysitting a code release, to help ensure that I don&#x27;t mix up local stuff with remote stuff.<p>4: music player. I stream music, so I rarely need to look at this except to change channels.",1383084062

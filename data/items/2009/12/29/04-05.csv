We're working on mobile payments, and we're looking for iPhone developers. If you or anyone you know is interested, feel free to send jobs@thinkcomputer.com an e-mail and mention HN in the subject line. We're ideally looking for people around the Bay Area, but if you've created something particularly awesome we'll be happy to take a look.<p>Thanks,<p>Aaron",1262062558
1020056,comment,1020007,1020032,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, first of all:<p><i>US researchers have found an antibody that hunts down prostate cancer cells</i> in mice...<p>That's <i>mice</i>, folks. Let's review the guidelines for titling your cancer-related article: If the result is <i>in vitro</i>, you must use the words <i>in vitro</i>; if it is in mice, you must use the word <i>mice</i>.<p>(Why? Because mice are not like humans. See my earlier musings on that subject here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=838160"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=838160</a> )<p>Meanwhile, like all crappy popular articles, this one provides no citation. It doesn't even mention the names of any of the researchers, poor dears. But Google and I can remedy this -- this seems to be the paper:<p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/12/15/0911397107.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/12/15/0911397107.abst...</a><p>Salient facts:<p>This is, as much as one can tell from an abstract, a fine preliminary result. But don't buy any stock yet.<p>Not only is this in mice, but this result is about attacking <i>human</i> prostate cancer that has been transplanted into mice. Now, this is a darn sight more impressive than killing cells in a dish, but it's still not the same problem as killing the cells in the human body where they originally evolved. The mouse is a nude mouse; it's immunodeficient (otherwise it would reject the human cancer). Part of the reason that the antibody may be working so well -- attacking the cancer, leaving other cells alone -- is that the cancer cells aren't just cancer, but also from a completely different part of the mammalian family tree.<p>The other big problem with these studies is that it's one thing to be able to label ""85%"" of metastatic cancer cells in an animal model, but that's not necessarily a cure. For one thing, among the remaining 15% may be the line of cells that is resistant to your antibody. Now you need another antibody!<p>Worse, antibodies are hard to deliver to every cancerous cell. They're not especially tiny molecules. They have a relatively easy time being delivered to normal tissues via the bloodstream, because normal tissues are very carefully engineered such that every cell is within a short distance of a capillary. But tumors, having gotten where they were by randomly flipping switches on their genomes like a toddler trying to launch the Space Shuttle, are pretty poorly organized. There are bits of the interior of a tumor that are so far from blood vessels that the cells there are asphyxiating. Unfortunately, because of this, one of the things that cancer cells tend to learn really early is how to survive in such low-oxygen conditions, and when an antibody comes along in the bloodstream and kills the easily-accessed cancer cells, it is likely to leave behind some of these orphan cells, which sit around waiting for the day that they will come across some more oxygen and start growing again. Then, a few months or years later, your cancer comes back.<p>(This, by the way, is also a big problem with classical chemotherapy and every other cancer treatment.)<p>So, this result is a relatively early report from a work in progress. Such work takes a great deal of time to come to fruition.",1262062490

1020053,comment,1019917,1019917,0,0,white_eskimo,,,"Hmm interesting. Back in October, I reported a dead sea lion outside my house (I live on the Bay) to the department of Ornithology and Mammalogy at the California Academy of Sciences. They came out and removed the animal's carcass, and told me it had died of kidney failure due to a sexually transmitted disease (Bacterial Vaginosis). They explained that half of the Pier 39 sea lions were victims of the STD.<p>More information can be found at <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.11.045"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.11.045</a><p>I doubt it, but I wonder if this STD had any impact on their leave...",1262061583

1020048,comment,1020007,1020032,0,0,affiliator,,,"Recomment(?) from a reddit thread on the same story from someone who claims to work in cancer research:<p><i>The chances that this antibody will work in humans is EXTREMELY small.<p>The model that would have to be used here is injecting human prostate cancer cells into nude mice (this is a strain that is totally lacking in its own immune system so foreign cancer cells can actually survive and not be killed within minutes), allowing the tumor to grow, and then injecting the antibody or even ust the antibody fragment int the tail vein. You then palpate the tumor over the next few weeks. You'd also want to sample the tumor and maybe do some TUNEL to check for actual rates of apoptosis.<p>Chances are very slim that an antibody that fights this specific strain of lab grown cancer (lab grown cancers have generally been grown for so long that they are heavily mutated to say the least) will be effective in humans. Humans have many, many, many different strains of prostate cancer and unless these researchers have accidentally stumbled upon the holy grail of surface markers that somehow indicate internal genetic expression...I am skeptical.<p>Additionally, you've linked to an article that is so vacuous that it doesn't even feel the need to cite the actual results which it is based upon.

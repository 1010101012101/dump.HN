They're waterproof, durable, inexpensive, and have good sound quality for the price. Regular earbuds fall out of my ears and these are the only ones that stay in.<p>That said, I've been using the MX680i's for 4+ months and I'm disappointed compared to the MX85's I had before. The insert that holds them in your ears isn't nearly as good as the old style. I often have to adjust these and they fall out at times. The MX85 never fell out.<p>The mic and controls are good though. I use them for calls daily. The volume buttons don't work on Android devices but the play button does.",1330120772

3631274,comment,3629904,3630604,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Thanks guys for the links, one of the references in the Wikipedia section was this one: <a href=""http://www.gpbatteries.com/html/pdf/Li-ion_handbook.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gpbatteries.com/html/pdf/Li-ion_handbook.pdf</a> which has a bit more information.<p>According to the GPBatteries guys LiON have <i>no</i> self discharge if they aren't being drawn down by a monitoring circuit. But they also mention that embedded safety circuits can run the batteries down a bit until those circuits stop working because there is insufficient charge in the battery to run them, and then the battery can't be charged (aka its a brick).<p>Of course you <i>could</i> charge it if you could get around the safety chip in that case it would just require a bit of cleverness.<p>Again my experience with LiON cells is that once they get to about 3V if you don't put a load on them they don't discharge any further on their own.  That would seem to be supported by the chemical energy needed to absorb the anions but I am not a chemist, just an aging EE. Thanks for the links.",1330120739

And the brief and unsatisfying technicalities only serve to highlight the confusion and uncertainty over where Microsoft wants it's developers to be investing.<p>What does ""authentically digital"" suppose to mean anyway?<p>> Simplified Windows 8 branding<p>Well this is not really a simple problem. I think pretty much 90% of the online world assumed after a while the window's logo was a flag. The wavy pixelated contrails, the ""flag"" screensaver, the flag-like symbols across it's products for years. To claim that it was not a meant to be a flag is understandable and perhaps quite correct, but to then make the logo look more like a flag than ever before just screams mixed metaphors. I understand the Shetland Islands are both delighted and horrified.<p>And the colour? Mine eyes doth protest.<p>I think Microsoft have been making great strides to address the stagnation that was prevalent for so long in much of their product range, but their marketing & pr is letting them down. I would love to see the billing for that design: ""It's not a flag, make it look like it's not a flag"", ""how about this flag design?"", ""OK, looks cool, can you make the blue a little brighter?

They have defaulted into ads because that's what Google did and that's what works for many other businesses. But I've never clicked on a Facebook ad and I don't know anyone who has unless it was research. I'm seeing highly targeted ads based on my interests and demographic and I just don't click because I'm too busy social networking. Whereas with Google my intent is ""search"" and so I occasionally click.<p>After recently starting to use them again I'm blown away at how useful and engaging the app is.

Here's an excerpt from Chapter ""Bring Back the Door"":<p>""In response to worker's gripes about noise, you can either treat the symptom or treat the cause. Treating the cause mean choosing isolation in the form of noise barriers -- walls and doors -- and these cost money. Treating the symptom is much cheaper. When you install Muzak or some other form of pink noise, the disruptive noise is drowned out at small expense. You can save even more money by ignoring the problem altogether so that people have to resort to tape recorders and earphones to protect themselves from the noise. If you take either of these approaches, you should expect to incur an invisible penalty in one aspect of worker's performance: They will be less creative.""",1330120604

Some kids don't want to consume, they want to do. It's not bad, but trying to get a kid like that to watch TV will be hard no matter how good it is.<p>You're right though, that is a tough age. Part of the problem is that kids in the 9-12 range don't want educational. You can grab DVDs of the old Batman animated series or similar, but if you want educational you are stretching. Most local stations have to purchase e/i programming themselves to meet their requirements, so the production qualities tend to reflect ""local budgets"". There is some good stuff out there (Aqua Kids used to be pretty good, but it's been a couple of years) but it's so hit and miss. If you think what you've got is bad, look through the catalog sometime and see what your station rejected...<p>That's one of the reasons I like PBS so much. He could still do <i>Arthur</i>, <i>WordGirl</i>, <i>Cyberchase</i>, <i>The Electric Company</i> or <i>Fetch!</i> (which is not my favorite show, but I bet a nine year old would like it).

3631207,comment,3629904,3629904,2,0,jfasi,,,"This is a good release, however there is a better way to present it.<p>By now, gasoline powered cars have been around for a hundred years. Everyone knows they are complex machines with lots of movings parts, and that they require regular maintenance to keep in working shape. What Tesla is putting forward here is the fact that the same principle applies to their electric cars: they need their own kind of TLC to be kept in good shape.<p>However, there is another point Tesla fails to get across. Over those hundred or so years, not only has the need to care of a gas-powered car entered into the public psyche, but also how that care must be carried out. Everyone knows that cars need oil changes and exhaust checks and all that. It's obvious by now.<p>However, that sort of awareness doesn't exist when it comes to electric cars. Saying they need care is great, but Tesla is missing an opportunity to develop the same sort of intuitive public awareness with regard to their vehicles. It's not just 'these cars need care,' it's 'these cars need care, and its of a kind you don't expect, that's OK because you haven't need raised on these vehicles since you were young.'<p>This way, the message would move from being an ever-so-slightly condescending implication that you forgot that electric cars need electricity, and refocuses on the need to augment the way in which people think about maintaining their vehicles.",1330119823

And it's all the client.<p>Before Dropbox my options for sharing a file with someone were all cumbersome:<p>- CD/DVD/Hard Drive/USB Stick. Unless they're not within 10 miles of me, then it's a total non starter.<p>- Email it. Except if it was too large, it would cause a litany of problems with mail servers.<p>- Toss is up on an FTP. Clunky. FTP is an awful protocol.<p>- Any of a dozen file sharing websites that I've never particularity trusted, and some of which require the person receiving the file to follow some directions or have an account. No. Just no. The portals for uploading are clunky.<p>Then Dropbox happened.<p>- Public folders? Genius. Doesn't change my workflow at all, just slap it in to the folder and copy a link that I can share with anyone. No accounts required on the other end.<p>- Shared folders? Changed how I work forever. Not only do I get an affiliate bump every time I get someone on the plan, but then it makes the process for THEM sending ME a file brain dead simple. I have the luxury of having access to an FTP account and knowing how to use it. Some of my clients and friends do not. Nor do I expect them to, or even want them to. FTP sucks.<p>Just today I went over five iterations of a design in real time with a friend, and all he had to do was stick a JPG in a folder. He didn't even have to tell me, I got a notification and everything. Awesome!<p>- Photos folder? Now I can just drop pics from my SD card and shoot an email to Mom. No clunky website, uploading, naming, organizing, configuring, and then finally sending. Just photos, copy to Dropbox folder, send her a link, done. Moms happy. I'm happy.<p>Do you notice a theme between those three things? They all get the hell out of my way. Every other offering on the planet wants to ask me things and do things and make the cloud storage process cumbersome and heavy. Dropbox, I move files in to a folder and it takes care of shit. It allows anyone -- regardless of experience level -- to leverage the power of a basic version control and synchronization system without lifting a finger.<p>THAT is the secret. Not that it's cloud. Not that it's hip. Not right place or time. Not hardware/software disassociation philosophic nonsense. It works. And it doesn't get in your way to get that work done. I don't even have any USB sticks anymore, and I don't care. Why go to the trouble of plugging in a device when I could just copy it to a folder?",1330119335

After doing a lot of research, I can recommend the Beyerdynamic DT-770's with a decent headphone amp ($50) as probably the best deal on closed-backs that are durable, beautiful, and rival sub-$200 open-back phones.<p>My biggest complaint with the Sony's/Sens', aside from lack of detail, is that they have a lot of sibilance, which becomes fatiguing after an hour or two. I wear my Grados whenever I can (but can't when other people are around due to sound leakage).",1330118453

3631075,comment,3629904,3629904,2,0,stitchy,,,"The comments here seem to fall into two unrelated categories: ""Tesla isn't telling customers the whole story"" and ""What did people expect to happen when they left their car unplugged for months?""<p>Both are valid points. Why are you arguing? The points don't seem mutually exclusive to me. Tesla has a lot going for it. They make innovative cars, and I would love to own one. That doesn't make the company's PR responses any less defensive and cagey. The response for this particular issue is a big turn off for me. I would definitely prefer that they didn't contradict themselves within the first three paragraphs.<p>I get it. Owners of Tesla cars need to charge their cars or they will be out $40,000. That makes sense to me. Batteries don't last forever. My Mother however doesn't care how the car works. She just wants it to work. She'll do the maintenance that you ask her to do, but she's not going to know why. So, she won't know why she can't leave the car at the airport for a month.<p>That's why it's important for Tesla to say, ""yes this is an important issue that is part of maintaining your car."" Not, ""A single blogger is spreading a rumor about electric vehicles becoming inoperable."" If my Mother read that last sentence, she might say to herself, ""oh, I guess that blogger was just lying,"" and move on without reading the whole article, now assuming that it's not possible to ""brick"" her car.<p>I also lay some blame at Michael Degusta's feet. I don't think that it was appropriate for him to title his article ""'Its A Brick'  Tesla Motors Devastating Design Problem."" I don't see this as a design problem. It works. The potential for bricking your car is just something you'll have to watch out for, just like not changing your oil is something you need to watch out for.<p>I think that Tesla was just reacting against the accusation that they had a design flaw. As long as they make sure that all of their customers know of the issue, it's not a design flaw. At that point it's maintenance. That's where I think that Tesla failed today. They skimped on their responsibility of informing the customer of important facts, so that they could come out smelling like roses.<p>P.S. Incidentally, if I were to take a trip to my mountain home in Italy for half a year, roughly how much would I expect to pay in electricity to keep my Tesla vehicle charged? Does it draw a constant amount of power for the entire time that I'm away?",1330118263

Then, in the 1990's, the number of channels started increasing. More options, great. Twice as many channels did allow for more specialization, so maybe there were twice as many things I wanted to watch. When it reached four times as many channels, though, there were still only twice as many things I wanted to watch. Ten times as many channels, and now I wasn't sure if there were even twice as many as in the old days, because the budgets for the good shows were being spread among more shows to provide vehicles for more ads in all those new broadcast channel-hours.<p>Then, along came TiVo. Ah, TV was fun again. I could skim the cream. Couldn't imagine life without it. But as the years passed, the things I grabbed with TiVo were losing quality, too, seemingly bleeding budget to the shows ""out there"" that my TiVo and I ignored.<p>Then, my TV set broke. I assumed I'd have to get a new one quickly because, of course, everyone had to have a TV, right? I was sure I'd go crazy without it.<p>But I didn't. As time passed, I found I grew less motivated to get a new one, not more.<p>Well, after years of no TV, we finally got one a few weeks ago, so we wouldn't have to gather 'round the laptop for Netflix and slide shows of family vacations.

To better analyze your objection, let us remove the taxpayer part first: Should art projects be funded (by whatever means) that the general public sees no value in, i.e. this is how I parsed your ""no one would pay for"". This goes into deep discussions about ""what is art"", ""how do you define the value of an art object"" etc. Without going into detail, let us observe that in almost all art fields it frequently happens that even the educated public's taste lags the appreciation. I don't know much about painting/sculpture etc. but examples abound in literature (one of the most famous is <i>The Great Gatsby</i>) and film.<p>So, the mechanism here is very much similar to entrepreneurship: an artist producing work of dubious value asks for support, there's considerable risk in this, i.e. the work is most probably <i>is</i> junk but you might as well have discovered the new Warhol or Banksy. Therefore, it's not a case of funding works ""no one would pay for"" but how to manage the risk.<p>The bigger question is: should the state be in this business, with its clueless, bloated and generally ineffective machinery? Again, avoiding the long discussions about how controlling government should be I propose (the obvious but somewhat naive) solution: government should fund <i>some reasonable amount</i> but the works so funded should be under joint ownership of the artist and the public, i.e. the artist should own it but the public should have perpetual view rights, at least from a web site. Continuing the NEA example I gave above, the text of those translations should be available from the NEA site. The public should get value in return, other than the moral feelgood effect of supporting artists.",1330117769

3631012,comment,3630674,3630886,6,0,kposehn,,,"Good point. I have given a lot of thought to sustainability with Facebook Ads, and my optimism follows the basic data of my experience ever since it opened up.<p>Originally, low CPC's were quite commonplace. I could advertise something and get a pretty good rate - $0.10 or so - and make some really good money. Over time, the base CPC has risen across the world. Right now, you're looking at $1.20 or so just to hit the US untargeted (this isn't the suggested bid, this is actually running all-US ads).<p>What is really telling however is CPC's on very tight interest groups. Let's say I target a set of interests in a city that gets me about ~2k people in the profile. It used to be, even a year ago, that I'd pay about $0.80 per click. Today, you'll be lucky to find $1.30 on the low end. As niches get narrower and people get better at mining interest, the CPC climbs. Long term, sustained CPC trends are clear indicators of increasing demand and the ROI to sustain them.<p>Why this isn't talked about so much has to do with barriers to entry. I'm telling everyone here a lot about what I do without revealing the finer details. Also, I would say that as with any venue, some products do better than others. You can sell big-ticket stuff on FB, you just have to go about it much differently. You can lose a lot of money on Facebook quite easily, so how you approach the market is a big factor.<p>That said, the secrecy surrounding the success FB advertisers like myself are having is a much stronger indicator than anything that is said publicly. Will it keep FB from missing earnings targets? Probably not, but I remain very bullish on where they are going and what they have to offer.",1330117429

6574293,comment,6573790,6573987,3,0,rickhanlonii,,,"> making me immediately skeptical of this one<p>From a fellow reader of Everything is Obvious, same here. It seems obvious (heh) to me that it&#x27;s not the _apology_ that caused an increase in trust, but the addition of neutral or better contact.<p>In all of the experiments, the control group did one action (e.g. asked for a cell phone or played their move) and the test group did something over and above that action which was a neutral or better action (a superfluous apology).<p>I see no reason to think that the same results could not be reproduced if the control said &quot;you have nice shoes&quot; or &quot;that was a nice move&quot;. That is, the conclusion should instead be that an additional amount of neutral or better contact with a person causes them to trust you more than they would without the statement--the contact does not have to necessarily be an apology.<p>In fact, the article admits as much in second to last paragraph:<p>>How trustworthy are these results? The accumulated findings from several experiments help build a convincing case, but unfortunately the field study - which had the potential to provide the most persuasive evidence - is seriously flawed. The actor apologised (sic) for the rain then asked to borrow a phone, or in the comparison condition he just asked to borrow the phone. There was no proper control condition. This means we don&#x27;t know if the impact of the apology was specific to making an apology or merely an effect of uttering any kind of ice-breaker.",1382133584

Then by the extreme left for undercounting!<p>Now the Wikileaks report, which I linked, discuss this -- so the <i>internal US data is out</i>! They are a bit higher than the low counts, still far from the Lancet report.<p>No signs of the conspiracies needed to hide the missing effects discussed by the IBC reality check (link above).<p>This change the subject of the discussion.<p>The question now is: Did the Lancet report authors cheat? Or just the local interviewers? Their data was totally wrong and the authors defended it like a bear mother defends her cub.<p>If they are honest, you&#x27;d expect a mea culpa and discussion about why their data is wrong.<p>But we won&#x27;t get any public discussion of the Wikileaks from them -- any more than they discussed the IBC reality check (see discussion above).<p>As I wrote above -- idealists lie.

It&#x27;s more of a &#x27;business rules&#x27; than &#x27;loose rules.&#x27;<p>I was at Google from 2006 to 2010, I arrived just after they decided &quot;mini kitchens&quot; (which were amazing collections of snacks and drinks near every bunch of engineers) needed to be reigned in, and left just after the first of the big purges of non-project projects. I was fortunate that since I had worked for Eric Schmidt at Sun we knew each other enough that I felt comfortable asking him pointed questions, like &quot;Uh, seriously? What does changing out the juice supplier (Odwalla) for a cheaper one do for employess?&quot; And he would often answer with insights into Google &#x27;growing up&#x27; in many ways the same way Sun did. Much of the fiscal questions were being driven by Patrick Pichette who was the new CFO and trying to get a handle on where all the money was going, and of course in 2009 there was the economic crash and it really drove home the issue of &quot;How much money is &#x27;too much?&#x27;&quot; (answer none) and &quot;How much money do we need for the worse case scenario?&quot; (answer all we can get) and questions of &quot;Gee we burn money like gasoline, what would happen if suddenly nobody wanted to advertise on the Internet?&quot; Those kinds of questions lead to a maturation process around money, and making sure that all the money that could be in the bank, was in the bank. Just good business. Challenging to make compelling user experiences though, although Apple had done so.<p>So long way of saying I don&#x27;t think that Google is &quot;milking&quot; their customers so much as they are no longer giving quite the value they used to, choosing instead to keep that additional value for themselves.",1382133085

The wiki we were using also added a 30 second delay to the process of updating documentation.<p>Never mind the fact that the team had one guy who was good at maven (who,  if asked how to do something the right way,  would tell my boss that I &quot;wasn&#x27;t a team player&quot;) and several other people who built POM files by cut-and-paste.<p>When performance review came around,  my boss told me I was &quot;too slow&quot; and that I wasn&#x27;t a team player because I was complaining about how slow the tools were.

Then I run an application on it on a  Docker cloud.  Then I install Python 3.0 and NumPy on it and take a snapshot.  And then I want to run the new app with these libraries.   I think when you deploy, or when images are being sync&#x27;d to machines, they can use the differential compression based on AUFS snapshots.  So instead of transferring 300 MB, maybe you will only transfer 30 MB.<p>That would seem logical based on what I&#x27;ve read.  But I have never actually gotten Docker to work, so I don&#x27;t know.

You own your work, and you can sell it with a traditional publisher at any time.<p>We&#x27;ve had traditional publishers pick up a few Leanpub books, and attempt to get more.  If you look at our bestsellers list (<a href=""https://leanpub.com/bestsellers_lifetime"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/bestsellers_lifetime</a>) you can see why.<p>Leanpub raises the BATNA to doing a deal with a traditional publisher.  Since we pay 90% minus 50 cents per copy in royalties, you earn $17.50 from a $20 ebook.  The types of books that HN readers would write would do well to be priced at this price point.  Authors choose the minimum and suggested price.  So, if you sell 1000 copies at that price, that&#x27;s $17,500; if you sell 5000 copies at that price, that&#x27;s $87,500.<p>Because of this, lots of &quot;niche&quot; books that would sell fewer than 5000 copies (and not be worth it for a traditional publisher) are totally worth it to be done on Leanpub, just for the direct revenue.

That, in my opinion, is precisely the type of person you <i>should</i> trust to Get Things Done, even when those things would seem, to most people, to be currently &quot;out of their hands.&quot;<p>In other words, <i>feeling</i> responsibility for everything around you is a necessary prerequisite for <i>agency</i>. You see this a lot in company owners. Why is the founder mopping the floor while everyone else is working? Because nobody else is doing it, it has to get done, and the buck stops with him. He&#x27;s responsible for everything, even the weather.",1382130614

I wish this had made it on hacker news last Friday!<p>I&#x27;m learning by making a little MVC framework with cgi-bin (eventually it&#x27;ll be portable to rust-http and elsewhere..). The best part about Rust is that in 99% of cases, if your &quot;logic&quot; is right, and your code compiles, everything will just work and run properly. Unlike in C where your logic may be right, but your pointers wrong, or in C# where your logic is right, but that threw a null reference exception, etc.<p>The hard part was that I tried writing Rust like I do C#. Using garbage collection elsewhere. The biggest hurdle is that when you&#x27;re designing your structures you must not think just about what they need to access. You must also think about the ownership of what they access, and the ownership of what will be using it.<p>After finally refactoring and figuring out my ownership model, turns out I didn&#x27;t even need garbage collection or reference counting. Everything could go onto the stack save for some vectors and mutable strings",1382130496

Like what is &quot;high school&quot; and &quot;university&quot; in Poland. I ask, because every time I read something about the American education system I have quite some trouble assessing the statements because of the foreign categorizations.<p>For example &quot;school&quot; in Germany comprises the first 12 or 13 years of education, with the first change of school happening after 4 or 6 years in primary school (with school starting at the age of 6). The following 13th till 18th year of education is held at a &quot;university&quot; where you earn a Bachelor and a Master degree. A PHD would be 3 to 5 further years in university.<p>I&#x27;ve pieced together that the American Bachelor seems to be more broad than the German one. My Bachelor degree was in Mathematics and it did not contain some mandatory stuff in humanities for example. Yet it seems we learned that stuff in the first 12 (/13) years already and thus the German Bachelor starts later than the American one? But that would also mean that German students would spend more time overall in education (the current average (of people with higher education) might be about 18 years) and I also find that implausible.<p>Basically I&#x27;m asking: Does someone know of a good comparative introduction to the American education system?",1382130451

(I&#x27;m aware this is my poor math skill, and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m working on.)<p>I don&#x27;t know if the sub has been edited, but it mentions lack of controls:<p>> How trustworthy are these results? The accumulated findings from several experiments help build a convincing case, but unfortunately the field study - which had the potential to provide the most persuasive evidence - is seriously flawed. The actor apologised for the rain then asked to borrow a phone, or in the comparison condition he just asked to borrow the phone. There was no proper control condition. This means we don&#x27;t know if the impact of the apology was specific to making an apology or merely an effect of uttering any kind of ice-breaker.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem to mention randomization either.<p>EDIT:<p>> This is significant because past research shows how mindlessly we often act in social situations. For example, back in the late 70s, Ellen Langer and her colleagues found that people were just as likely to give way at a photo-copier if a queue-jumper uttered the nonsensical excuse &quot;because I need to make copies&quot; as when he uttered &quot;because I&#x27;m in a rush.&quot;<p>Compare this to situations in the UK where if a shopkeeper returns nearly all your change, but keeps a penny, the customer will often wail until they get it, and make a fuss about it.",1382130361

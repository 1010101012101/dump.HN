6467876,comment,6467272,6467863,2,0,yareally,,,"I know there&#x27;s more, but the numbers are still far from even in many hard science & engineering degrees. I started out in Civil Engineering and even there, the ratio of guys to girls was scarcely better than when I transferred to Computer Science (this was in the few degree specific courses I took as well).<p>I do consider Bio and Medicine to be hard sciences and you are correct the gender imbalance is significantly less than some other science fields. However, it seems to be more acceptable in American Culture for parents to accept their daughters going into those types of degrees perhaps due to the relation to traditional career paths women have gone into (such as nursing). If that&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s rather sad and hopefully such preconceived notions die out in the near future.<p>I&#x27;m curious though as to how many female students end up going into Computer Science or Engineering because a family member or parent was in one of those fields. I have a few female friends either pursuing or have obtained a degree in Computer Science and each had at least one parent that was in a related field.",1380517104

The emails are &quot;read&quot; by code that determines how to render them in the browser. They are &quot;read&quot; by code that writes them into a search index.<p>Why one of these things constitutes an &quot;intercept&quot; and not the others don&#x27;t is ridiculous- whether the action is in the &quot;normal order of business&quot;. The definition of intercept as the &quot;acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication&quot; simply can&#x27;t apply to just one of these things.<p>By the Plaintiffs&#x27; arguments, any system on the internet that forwards an SMTP packet is an unlawful intercept, because it has to acquire the contents to copy them from one channel to another.<p>All of the decisions on this seem to be based on the scenario where an intercept involves a person listening to a phone call. I would submit, that if it is just code reading the email that was intentionally sent to the system the code is running on, it is not really being intercepted.",1380516869

That involves automated processing, without which the system can&#x27;t function.<p>I&#x27;m very much opposed to surveillance and other forms of privacy invasion, but I think the discussion needs to be based on a clear understanding of the nature of the processing involved, and the debate to be around which forms of automatic processing fall into the &quot;acceptable&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; category.<p>Examples of the latter, in my view, would include storing a copy of your content for longer than necessary to transmit the call, doing speech-to-text analysis and using the extracted words to build up a profile on the caller/callee, and making the recorded information available to government agencies for surveillance purposes or corporate entities for advertising purposes.<p>&quot;Listening in&quot; is an insufficiently-defined term, which doesn&#x27;t provide enough information for us to have a proper debate about exactly what&#x27;s going on.",1380516751

There are many different kinds of concentrations, like application security (which could be native code or web apps or both), network security/defense, penetration testing, forensics, etc.<p>Programming can play a big role in all of those, though.

Until parents abandon some of the long held stereotypes of roles and jobs that boys and girls should have when they grow up (as well as the type of toys they should play with), it&#x27;s going to be a struggle to find more of a balance in many of the hard science degree programs and careers.<p>Computer Science and Computer Engineering sadly end up being viewed in the same light for boys as Nursing is for girls. That is, there is a long standing cultural notion in the United States that girls are supposed to be nurses and boys are not, despite how silly that all seems. It&#x27;s even more perplexing, since many of the early computer scientists were women, just as many of the nurses starting in the 19th century were founders of their modern profession (with the Crimean War and the American Civil War).<p>Institutions may try to shape and encourage change, but it comes down to the parents understanding that roles and jobs should be independent of one&#x27;s gender and reinforcing that notion in their children. Especially in the United States where parents play a large role in the intended degree of their children because they are generally expected to help pay for part of the tuition.

I just don't see how a hosted app is going to protect you from this kind of thing. The only difference is that the hosted app is presented with a ""native"" API as opposed to an RPC API, but it's just as vulnerable to deprecation, and will remain so as long as you are a third-party.<p>Except that the cost in term of infrastructure and ongoing maintenance (code review, etc) is higher, which IMHO makes it likely to be phased out sooner than a web API.",1351000780

Usually it's because they've downloaded a warez copy of one or more of my books and enjoyed it and want to pay. Well, I'm happy they enjoyed the books, and pleased that they want to pay me  but still: no tipjar.</i><p>> <i>If I put a Paypal tipjar on this blog, to take conscience money from folks who've downloaded a (cough) unauthorized ebook or two, the money would come to me, not to the publisher. And without the publisher those books wouldn't exist: wouldn't have been commissioned, wouldn't have been edited, wouldn't have been corrected and marketed and sold in whatever form filtered onto the unauthorized ebook market. (Yes, they commission books, and pay authors for them up-front  a vital part of the process, because most of us can't afford to take a year to write a book on spec and then hope somebody liked it enough to buy it. And if you think my bank manager would front me the kind of advance money that Ace, Orbit, or Tor have no difficulty offering for a novel that isn't even written yet, let alone doing so without charging interest or asking for their money back when the product's late, well ... you might want to think again.)</i><p>> <i>Your typical book publisher is not like the music or movie industry; they run on thin margins, and they're staffed by underpaid, overworked folk who do it because they love books, not because they're trying to make themselves rich on the back of a thousand ruthlessly exploited artists. I think their effort deserves to be rewarded appropriately.</i><p>This is, I think, an excellent response.",1351000718

Hacking is all about decentralization to ensure free access. If github implements a policy (surely there's some action permitted by TOS, perhaps which most people would like, that you wouldn't), UI change, etc., you have no real recourse outside of convincing them it's in their best interest to change it to how you like it. With a decentralized system where you run your own node you can modify the code and behavior at your discretion.<p>On top of the possibility for customization and extension, having more independent nodes means less chance of catastrophic failure. The cloud is remarkably unstable; look at heroku's uptime and at cascading failures even in redundant cloud systems for an example. It'd take the whole internet falling apart for thousands of individual hackers' repositories to all break down.",1351000645

The darn property tax system is set out to screw me.<p>This is really the whole reason that corporations were invented: so that people could pool their resources together to achieve things that a single person could not achieve.  In fact, they used to just be temporary and when the original stated project on the charter was complete then the corporation disbanded.<p>If a little guy company wants to own a patent under this scheme either a) they have to file the patent with a lower value so they can make the annual ""property tax"" but that may cap their wins in the future if it's infringed on.  or b) get funding from investors to make the property tax payments.  Or c) sell or license the patent to a larger entity that could benefit from it.  In the case of (c) if it's truly as valuable as they say it is to the patent office then they should be able to find a suitable buyer.<p>Flat capped taxes on things produce market inefficiencies such as you see in the domain name arena: It costs very little to hold onto things that might be valuable one day.  If instead there was a sliding scale to renew a domain based on it's value then you wouldn't really see domain squatters.  They'd be forced to sell their domains to someone that could make more productive use out of the resource.  Same with land and property taxes.  And maybe the same for patents?  I kind of like this idea.",1351000614

Not only was I surprised that Amazon covered this under the warranty, but the service I received was really fantastic. The Kindle had originally been shipped to Ireland (where I live), but I was in India when it was broken. I phoned Amazon and they had a replacement shipped to Kathmandu (the next stop on my itinerary with dates certain enough that I was happy to have something shipped there). It was shipped fine and they reimbursed the cost of shipping back the broken unit (I sent a scan of the distinctly dodgy receipt issued by a Kathmandu shipping agent) and they also paid me back the import charge that Nepalese customs levied on the ""new"" Kindle. All told I was blown away by the quality of the service given the funniness of what I was asking them to do (shipping to random locations etc).",1351000507

I am running the RTM (retail) version released on MSDN/Technet+/Volume Licences/et al.<p>I've ran it for about a month and while Windows Explorer is a big step forwards, everything related to the ""Modern"" UI (Metro) is a big step backwards. The apps are poor, the finish is poor, and the intuition is non-existent.<p>The whole thing feels like an unfinished product. It is like they released it mid-production and thus ideas are only half baked. For just one example, the old-fashioned Control Panel is still used to configure 75%+ of the system but yet getting to it is now buried.<p>Originally I was going to recommend you get W8 if you had a touch device, but given how badly Modern UI is currently performing I am instead recommending getting either an iPad or an Android Tablet. Both of which will give a better user experience.<p>The biggest issue I would say is not the design/concepts but instead just how poorly they have been carried out, how rushed, and how messy.<p>Imagine for a second that Apple's development philosophy was 70% features and then 30% polish. Now imagine that Microsoft's previous development philosophy was 85% features and then 15% polish.

They can choose either to pay that tax or sell the patent to someone else.<p>The government would offer to buy any patent for its market value, using tax revenue gathered from other patents, in doing so putting the invention into the public domain.<p>This would discourage companies from building large 'defensive' patent portfolios, since they'd be expensive to maintain. It works for the 'lone inventor' scenario too, since the market value of a new, untried invention would be low.<p>Once a patent's value is proven by developing the patent, its value will rise. At some point, the benefit derived from the patent's monopoly rights will no longer be worth the cost, and the rational thing to do is sell the invention.""<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4558402"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4558402</a>",1350998395

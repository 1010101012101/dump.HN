4054723,comment,4052997,4054585,5,0,sparsevector,,,"I think what you're describing is basically the non-stochastic setting.  The idea there is to assume absolutely nothing about the rewards (they can be generated by quickly changing distributions or even an adversary) but still try to do as well as the best single arm.  The standard algorithm for this problem is the multiplicative weights update method, also called the exponentially weighted average method or the hedge algorithm.  It's a really simple method where you keep a probability distribution over the arms and then reweight the probabilities at each time step using something proportional to the exponential of the rewards of the arms.   If you run it for T time steps on a problem involving N arms, it gives you regret O(sqrt(T log N)).  This is actually the best possible bound without additional assumptions.  This is a good paper on it:  <a href=""http://cns.bu.edu/~gsc/CN710/FreundSc95.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cns.bu.edu/~gsc/CN710/FreundSc95.pdf</a><p>There are many, many different variations of the method and result.  For example, you can show improved results assuming different things about the rewards.  For exapmle, you can show O(log(T)) regret with certain additional assumptions.  This is a really good book on different non-stochastic online learning problems:\n<a href=""http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~lukstafi/pmwiki/uploads/AGT/Prediction_Learning_and_Games.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~lukstafi/pmwiki/uploads/AGT/Predi...</a>",1338573568
4054722,story,,,2,0,rayiner,"Ask HN: Journals for CS practitioners?",,"Does anybody know of any journals that cater to practitioners in computer science, rather than academics? I think journal articles are a great way to introduce novel ideas or discuss clever implementations. Practitioner-oriented articles were pretty common back in the 1980's, but seem to have all but disappeared today. That's sad, because there are a lot of cool ideas that don't necessarily break new ground in theoretical CS but are still interesting to practitioners. E.g. Joel Bartlett at DEC published a really great paper on conservative garbage collection in the late 1980's, complete with sample code, that formed the basis of numerous implementations, including the collectors in SBCL and Dalvik. Articles like that are few and far between these days.<p>I think there is a nice middle ground between informal blog posts and theoretical CS papers, and I'd love it if HN-ers could point me to something that fills that gap.",1338573563

Im searching for people who enjoy learning and making embedded systems. MindTribe is a small company, and I am looking for people with whom I would personally like to work and who want to work with me and my team. We've moved from Palo Alto to SF and we're finally settled into our new location. Now, besides experienced SENIOR embedded software engineers, I am looking for JUNIOR engineers as well. If you enjoyed your microcontroller classes in school, come join us in SF for continuing education.<p>Here are the tools I use regularly: The C programming language (specifically ISO/IEC 9899:1990); Eclipse, Make, Subversion, Git, Python; Linux, Embedded Linux, Android, iOS; ARM processors (TI OMAP, TI Stellaris, NXP LPC); Atmel AVR/AVR32, Microchip PIC, TI MSP430, Cypress PSoC<p>Here is what I enjoy doing at work: Writing embedded software that runs on cool hardware; Figuring out how to apply agile techniques such as test-driven development to embedded product development; Reducing regressions and supporting customer development with agile techniques; Developing embedded libraries for things like USB, TCP/IP, graphics displays, sprites, fonts, encryption, etc.; Having long, dorky conversations with coworkers about programming languages, physics, DIY sous-vide setups, whether it should be called ""firmware"" or ""software"", etc.<p>Here is what I enjoy doing outside of work: Hiking, walking around San Francisco; Pseudonymous humor blogging; Cooking and baking; Photography; Reading. Recently: ""Test Driven Development for Embedded C"", ""The Clean Coder"", ""The Four Steps to the Epiphany"", ""Norwegian Wood"", ""The Mind's Eye"", and currently ""Sealab: America's Forgotten Quest to Live and Work on the Ocean Floor""<p>You can see examples of how Ive applied my tools and passion here: <a href=""http://mindtribe.com/portfolio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mindtribe.com/portfolio/</a><p>I ask that you bring some C and microcontroller experience--other than that, you don't have to use the same tools and you don't have to enjoy the same things.

This should make frequently changing one's passwords less painful.<p>Is there any reason this is a bad idea? Obviously it's not as secure compared to a purely random string of the same length, but my thought is it would encourage people to change their passwords more often since there'd be less friction involved in doing so.<p>EDIT: I should note that a password manager is a far better idea. But for places where that's not practical (OS login, or the password to your password database), I feel this might be useful.<p>EDIT ALSO: While I like the XKCD idea in theory, I think it sucks in practice.

They aren't. Good ideas are like the DNA of a product or service. Separating the wheat from the chaff is the purpose of executing and iterating. And don't confuse ideas with how people initially attempt to express what's rolling around in their head. People often don't know how to really effectively communicate such things. Iteration is often just an exercise in trying to figure out how to properly express the underlying idea. That is what pivoting is often about.<p>Good ideas are not a dime a dozen.

After a certain point, whatever you add will just detract from the performance of something else. That detraction could either be from the landing page itself (if your lucky) or some longer term variable (hope those ""conversions"" don't cost you too much money.) I have had both occur.<p>2) ""Statistically significant"" can just be noise when variables are fairly close to each other. After getting rid of the obvious losers, I've watched the ""winner"" of elements like button color change back and forth daily for weeks, with no clear winner, even with 30,000+ conversions a day flowing through. This is the kind of thing visualwebsiteoptimizer would write a case study on 1 hours worth of traffic and declare a winner.<p>3) You brand can be shit on when dealing with returning users. They are used to seeing one thing and now they see something else. Imagine if the colors, theme, and button locations changed every day (or to be fair, once a week) when you visited hn. Often ""better converting"" designs actually convert worse when introduced on existing customers.<p>4) Failure to account for external variables, especially when dealing with small sample sizes. Testing is often done most vigorously with paid traffic sources as the monetary incentive is direct. The traffic source itself is often a bigger determining factor behind the conversion rate than the design.

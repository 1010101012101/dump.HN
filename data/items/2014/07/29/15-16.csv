Also, remember that large enterprise projects are generally built by people who are not users themselves. This is where the technology crowd often draws false conclusions, reflecting on projects of their own, where they have intimate knowledge of the problem space. There are likely very few forward-thinking engineers who also have visibility into the intricacies of the various SS systems.

It&#x27;s typically a process made for sourcing completely interchangeable, relatively simple supplies or services seeing terribly complex software or systems dumped into them - not &#x27;shoe-horned&#x27; as that would imply an attempt at fitting - simply dumped so that requirements spill on the floor and everything gets jumbled up onto the existing conventions.<p>Given that, providing an agnostic SOW is a great way to end up with stuck with a lowball bid which makes the most self-serving, word-splitting assumptions possible to stick you with something utterly apart from what you need.<p><i>>&#x27;(b) so ridiculously vague or out of this world impossible (&quot;We need you to basically rewrite GitHub for us and the budget is $30k&quot;) that it wasn&#x27;t even worth the time.&#x27;</i><p>Related to what I said above - these requirements are not as hard and fast as they might seem. Writing a defensively worded response, getting your foot in the door to talk with the people who actual request and implement is not a terrible way to start doing real work.<p><i>>&#x27;Even now where I work, we have to deal with government agencies literally telling us they can&#x27;t tell us any requirements at all because that would give us an advantage over other firms somehow.&#x27;</i><p>Right.<p>It&#x27;s not unlike any sort of courtship, business or otherwise. You can&#x27;t just ask outright, you have to make friends and hear the information gush over lunch or volunteer some no-fee consulting and take notes.<p>Big vendors and VARs have people who do this nearly full-time so it&#x27;s certainly much harder for a small company, but not impossible.<p><i>>&#x27;We just have to pitch our product to them and hope that it fits, even though at this point in our development cycle we could (and really, want to) make adjustments, feature additions, etc. to fit them if we were allowed to.&#x27;</i><p>Something to be aware of, when dealing with a Lockheed terms like &#x27;adjustments, feature additions&#x27; are euphemisms for &#x27;one million dollars&#x27;.

Each share is now worth $50, and each shareholder has $50 in cash.

Each of the remaining shares is worth the same amount, but $500K of new shares is released to new uses.  Same net value as above.  No new value is created or left behind, it&#x27;s just the dividend gives a partial payment on each share, while the buyback gives a full payment on some of the shares.<p>What IBM does is borrow money rather than pay cash, because they can deduct the interest payments on the debt.

I think most homeowners can develop a general idea of what their house is worth if they just do basic comparisons, and if they have a mortgage or other obligations they must pay out of the home sale, can develop a halfway decent bottom-line figure. Also, when homeowners meet with an agent, one of the first things they discuss after seeing the property is listing price. The agent is incentivized to provide a non-lowball listing price because the owner has yet to sign a contract at that point and could still be soliciting other agents.<p>I think the real leveraging of the agents commission structure comes on more borderline decisions.

This, as you get from my anecdote above, was not my educational background.<p>It is funny people laugh when they hear me bust out into Arabic in front of them.  I told them I am a language major by trade, and did IT in college to make money.  Many people congratulate on mastering these &quot;magical bodies of knowledge that are witchcraft, because surely I (the person I am helping) could never get it.&quot;  If you want scary, these are other people married to Arab men and women, as am I.  Decades of exposure mean nothing.<p>Now why is that?  Grades breed mediocrity.  Good students stroke their ego, and most students give up when they cannot compete with good students.  So we encourage people to believe &quot;I am a magician that speaks computer&quot; and &quot;Arabic is impossible&quot; (if you beleive that, try teaching and explaining inconsistent English grammar; Arabic has encoded in the morphology a lot of syntax that would scare you into seeing what is like a human programming language) and accept mediocrity because evaluation and rank is more important than effort.  I see it so often, even from students, I mess with them when they come to my office.  I never bitched to change my grades.  Why?  I was busy reading.  Who cares!<p>Please keep being that professor, I hope you save some of them.  What is the most cautionary part of that tale is the people in my story all end working for government, some as counter-terrorism and intel guys.  They cannot string a sentence together in Arabic, despite the A, and dictate USG policy &quot;on dem terrorist A-rabs&quot; so this culture will get us a real far.",1406648277

The SSA has almost 60 million beneficiaries, and deals with distributing an entitlement that is extremely sensitive and protected by layers of legal process. 8,000 Social Security checks get lost,[1] and its not a blog post, its national news.<p>Moreover, a lot of lean and agile processes just aren&#x27;t consistent with political reality. There&#x27;s no minimal viable product, there&#x27;s no invite-only beta testing, there&#x27;s no iteration, there&#x27;s no A/B testing, etc. Technical decisions (&quot;let&#x27;s just roll out to northern Alabama first&quot;) become divisive political ones. Purchasing decisions (&quot;we&#x27;ve had good luck with this vendor before&quot;) become the basis for accusations of favoritism and corruption.<p>Perhaps most importantly, there&#x27;s no failing fast. The private sector accepts the fact that many engineering projects will fail.[2] Good companies take care not to punish failure unreasonably. But in the public sector, failure is just license for those opposed to project to crow: &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t have been doing this anyway!&quot; If you fail fast, it&#x27;s easy to pin the blame on you. This creates a perverse incentive to drag a project along so failure happens over years if not decades.<p>[1] <a href=""https://medium.com/@jan.curn/how-bug-in-dropbox-permanently-deleted-my-8000-photos-cb7dcf13647b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@jan.curn/how-bug-in-dropbox-permanently-...</a><p>[2] Most big IT projects fail: <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243396/Healthcare.gov_website_didn_t_have_a_chance_in_hell_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243396/Healthcare.go...</a>.

Business Analysts. &quot;Metawork&quot; in the words of a coworker who used to architect BPM implementations at the parent corporation of my job. Getting consensus from possibly hundreds of stakeholders.<p>Generally, the disconnect is that management is under the assumption that you can manage your way to success, so they add more overhead to watch and prod at the proceedings. Development is almost always an afterthought in most business projects. The first thing they do? Get consensus, which is generally everyone putting in ideas so that they seem involved—see Atwood&#x27;s Duck[1]. After you have a ton of often contradictory ideas, you need to have them prioritized. And since nobody managing the project is technical, they need to hold countless &quot;prioritization meetings with stakeholders and implementers.&quot; Often times the meetings will grind to a standstill while process analysts and engineers argue over the wording of things. Usually the analyst will tell the engineer that the business has standardized on a set of terms, of which are not the trade names for things. Maybe everyone uses a set of terms which aren&#x27;t the &quot;correct&quot; wording.<p>After things are prioritized based on the wrong criteria, they&#x27;re then pushed off to an engineering group who are tasked with implementing things exactly to spec. Since the definitions are incorrect, they need to constantly circle back and check with the stakeholders to double check. Occasionally checking in will involve a &quot;subject matter expert&quot; who is on vacation, and the only one allowed to answer the question. (Thus stalling that item and anything depending on it.) Others will often say &quot;it&#x27;s above my paygrade&quot; in an attempt to avoid culpability.<p>After the project has run long and only has a majority of the features complete, people are reassigned to other projects, and the app is sent to QA to hand-test features. Sometimes it will involve the &quot;stakeholders&quot; sitting in a room for days or weeks, manually clicking their way through the interface. Maybe the project is declared a boondoggle, deleted, and replaced with someone else&#x27;s pet project.<p>So yes, not logical.<p>1: <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/</a>",1406647034

If I intentionally violate the license, can GM sue me if in writing they claim Ford owns this software, not GM?  Or if Ford wanted, just to be jerks, could they sue me for using this GM software, because after all the license says Ford owns it.

Firefox checks URLs associated with the download against a local Safe Browsing blocklist. If the binary is signed, Firefox checks the verified signature against a local allowlist of known good publishers. If no match is found, Firefox 32 and later queries the Safe Browsing service with download metadata (NB: this happens only on Windows, because signature verification APIs to suppress remote lookups are only available on Windows). In case malware is detected, the Download Manager will block access to the downloaded file and remove it from disk, displaying an error in the Downloads Panel below.<p>How can I turn this feature off? This feature respects the existing Safe Browsing preference for malware detection, so if you’ve already turned that off, there’s nothing further to do.

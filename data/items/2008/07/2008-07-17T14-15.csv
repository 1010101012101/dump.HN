248520,comment,248437,248437,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I remember getting into an argument with a sociology professor (in hindsight, probably a Marxist) who stated that there are no instinctual behaviors. I gave a simple example--babies suckling--that just angered him more.<p>Obviously, all behavior is partly shaped by instinct. But the connection is so non-deterministic that it's pretty easy to completely deny it. Sometimes the dog goes to his foodbowl at 2:00, sometimes at 2:10. Or, sometimes he smacks his lips, sometimes not. Ergo, the dog does not have an instintual urge to eat. At least not in a particular way. If nothing else, you could probably teach a dog, BF Skinner-like, to have anorexia nervosa. Behavior <i>can be engineered</i>. No doubt about it.<p>The problem, of course, is that personality qualities are partly inherited just like intelligence. This is problematic for a couple reasons:<p>1. The practice of measuring intelligence is well-developed and the results have been carefully studied. This is not the case with vague behaviors like ""hardworkingness"".<p>2. Traditionally, when coming up with excuses for why different groups have different levels of intelligence, other types of behavior are brought up: ""Those Asian students spend all their time studying. Of course they succeed."" This suggests that studiousness is the prescription for fixing bad students. But, in fact, that very studiousness is largely shaped by genetics. Sociobiology kills off the last fantasies of Marxism.",1216305958

248501,comment,248378,248378,0,0,randombit,,,"The idea presented in this article that /dev/urandom output is predictable is completely wrong. It is simply not secure from an information theoretic perspective: if an attacker had some amount of previous /dev/urandom data, and no new entropy was introduced into the pool, they could derive future output. However it is still cryptographically strong/computationally strong: actually doing this seems to require knowing how to invert SHA-1, which is apparently a difficult problem (I believe the best anyone has done is to invert 2 of the 3 rounds of MD4, which is a much weaker hash).<p>For much the same reason, RSA is not information-theoretically secure (if you have the public key, you have all the information you need to get the private key: you 'just' factor the modulus). That does not mean it is insecure, it just means you must make sure that the computational effort required is greater than the expected maximum computational effort anyone might expend (or, preferably, the maximum computational effort that might be feasible within your security lifetime).",1216305029

248483,comment,247239,248406,0,0,jcl,,,"I realize that the general problem of object recognition can be arbitrarily difficult, but so is the general problem of text recognition: How can a computer determine if a downward stroke is a one, or a lowercase L, or an uppercase I?  And yet the text-recognition captchas have been broken -- not because the problem is easy but because captcha breakers have exploited artifacts of individual captchas to get a correct answer a modest percentage of the time.  The 3D captcha (as the article author described it) is highly constrained -- a small library of objects in static poses -- so it has similarly exploitable artifacts.<p>The captcha-breaking computer has no need to infer what an object would look like from another view if someone has already manually reproduced the library of models; in that case the problem reduces to identifying which models from the library are in the picture and what angle they are being viewed from.  Although the problem is no doubt difficult, the silhouette strategy I described is similar to other published object recognition approaches known to work, e.g.:<p><a href=""http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bandlow98recognising.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bandlow98recognising.html</a><p>And the approach doesn't need to work perfectly: the captcha breaker is only interested in improving his chances of guessing correctly.  If an automated approach only guesses correctly even 20% of the time, the captcha is effectively broken.<p>In the case where two images of objects are very similar -- like your CRT vs. LCD example -- even a human would have difficulty differentiating.  By definition that makes these objects bad for the captcha, so the captcha author would either leave them out of the library of objects, or he would need to make the captcha more tolerant of human error, which makes things easier for the captcha-breaker.",1216303716

It just strikes me as a small niche, and one that may be hard to make money at.<p>Having said that though, I can see it being useful for people like me. There's nothing worse than looking on a standard job site and seeing pages of ""corporate type jobs asking for a list of meaningless buzzwords"". But I'm a very very small minority :)",1216568832
251418,comment,251115,251115,0,0,swombat,,,"I haven't deleted my account, but I uninstalled the widget, for similar reasons to arthurk, and something a little more critical.<p>No matter how accurate RescueTime might be, it can only tell me what I've done after the fact (usually a week later when I check the report). As I wrote in my blog post here: <a href=""http://inter-sections.net/2008/01/02/feedback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inter-sections.net/2008/01/02/feedback</a> when providing feedback, timeliness is very important. For an application trying to stop me from procrastinating, I think the time to do so is <i>while I'm procrastinating</i> - not a week later. A week later, the only effect is to make me feel bad about it. It's a bit like getting a Vodafone phone bill for Â£200 for the month that ended 60 days ago. At that point you can't do anything other than feel bad, it's far too late to correct the course.<p>Here's a constructive idea for the RescueTime team (which they may choose to implement or not): add a feature that turns the RescueTime widget into a little minder (trained on the data that you've fed it for so many months) that can tell when I've wasted a lot of time on sites like YCNews or other random sites <i>today</i>, and pop up a little message pointing that out to make me feel a little ashamed of it, so that it steers me back towards productivity <i>before</i> it is too late.<p>Now that would be something. And since RescueTime is integrated with a web service, chances are you could get people to pay a nominal sum for that service. If I tried it and it really was quite good at salvaging those odd days, here or there, that I waste procrastinating, I would grudgingly but willingly pay up to about $5/m for it.",1216568774

251415,comment,250704,251395,0,0,foompy_katt,,,"I really appreciate your concern, and I'm with you on the anti-censorship bandwagon. But, widespread censorship is not popular with a majority of the public- if it were, it would have already been done. They can't even make pornography illegal. The O'Reilly's of the world could just as easily argue, ""Our copyright laws make it possible for them to make money. Kill their copyrights!!!"". But lately, the most they've ever managed to accomplish is getting meaningless ""Parental advisory"" labels on CD and game covers.<p>Anyway, it wouldn't really be ""their"" tax dollars paying for the music you like, any more than it would be your tax dollars paying for their Christian music (remember, there's no discrimination in what's purchased). Faced with also having their free Christian music taken away, I'm pretty sure they'll ease up in their opposition. It's better to think of it as your tax dollars paying for the music you like, their tax dollars paying for the stuff they like.<p>I hope that if ever a law like this were to be passed, you would continue to be concerned. But, I gotta say I always find it annoying when people criticize what might otherwise be a wonderful idea, by arguing that some people might be stupid about it, so we shouldn't do it. It's time to stop being so  afraid of stupid people.<p>Government pays for and administers roads, the military, the justice system, and a host of other things that are much more abusable than our entertainment. They don't completely mess up all those other things, and I don't think it's likely to go badly when it comes to music. Given that the worst thing the government could do would be to not pay for certain things, meaning the artists would have to sell the music just like before, that's not exactly devastating.",1216568415

More prominent there, as compared to the side bar which has ""not as important"" information. (This is a job site, get them right to it!)<p>4) Love the apply functionaity! No silly sign up and nonsense. I would make the cover letter input box into a text area, or make it expandable.

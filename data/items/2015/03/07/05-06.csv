The problem then is that prospective employees have no way of knowing that a company is decent versus another company that is not. Will I do another work sample for another company? I&#x27;m thinking likely not, but I haven&#x27;t ruled out the possibility. Note though, that the company must offer something of great value for me to even consider it. In my case, that&#x27;s remote work. I would never consider it for a non-remote company. Period.<p>Still, a company could have a great, responsive process in place. But my experience, and that of others, is that it&#x27;s not worth my time and effort to do work for free. Let&#x27;s be clear: this is what is being asked of the candidates. It therefore starts to undermine any company using such a process even though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an inherently bad process.",1425707866

The reason we have a 30 day timer is that we use the reclaimed space, if we were to infinitely house a copy of every file that was uploaded to us, it would dramatically raise our costs, and at $5/month for an unlimited product our margins are very thin as it is. Most companies that do keep data &quot;forever&quot; augment that cost by having either tiered pricing, or &quot;per GB&quot; pricing so that they can continue covering the cost of the space for as long as that file exists. Since we&#x27;re unlimited and inexpensive for the service, we don&#x27;t have that elasticity. That&#x27;s not to say we haven&#x27;t thought about enacting an additional fee for that type of service, but we haven&#x27;t quite figured out a good way of doing it.

I personally need to think things on my own without having the pressure of having to tell the interviewer what I&#x27;m thinking. Not only does it alter my thought pattern and remove a lot of the ability to think, but the extra pressure from wondering whether I&#x27;m saying the right things or taking too long to think before stopping myself so I can please the interviewer pretty much removes my ability to solve any sort of complex problem I haven&#x27;t solved before.

At a professionally managed company, termination &quot;with cause&quot; will be the culmination of a &quot;progressive discipline&quot; process unless you do something so egregious that they must walk you straight out the door.<p>In common parlance, &quot;laid off&quot; means that you are not given &quot;cause,&quot; and are eligible for those benefits.<p>Under some conditions, a company that is planning to lay off more than a certain number of people must announce it in advance. This is a &quot;mass layoff.&quot; Also, a laid off person is potentially eligible for re-hiring, and the details are often written into union contracts.<p>I suspect due to the legal implications of mass layoffs, companies will use some other term such as &quot;reduction of force&quot; for routine business-downturn layoffs.<p>Naturally, if a company needs to reduce its workforce, they will sack the weakest employees, but it will typically be done without &quot;cause&quot; in order to avoid a potential lawsuit for false termination, and because letting people have their unemployment benefit is the decent thing to do.",1425706466

If by abuse you mean some advantage of negotiating position that the employer could use to eke out long hours (or some other surprise change in the job description), well, the increased ease of firing is canceled out by the increased ease of the employee deciding to get a new job.  The degree to which this is the case depends on the job market at the time.   You might also observe that a system that has what you call strong employee protection is also prone to abuse (or what you might call people taking advantage of their negotiating position), in the other direction. Maybe it&#x27;s more important in America to be proactive about avoiding living in a one-company town.<p>Advantage of negotiating position is usually expressed through compensation rates because it&#x27;s bad business to make employees hate the company after they already have a job.  But, you know, I work in software and can&#x27;t tell what it&#x27;s like being a barista or farm worker.<p>Edit: and please correct my misunderstanding if you mean something else by abuse.

Recently, I applied to three different companies that asked me to do a code sample that took from about two to eight hours each. I generally don&#x27;t work for free, but I had some spare time and decided why not? I did all three and turned them in. Out of three, one company liked my sample but in the interview that followed, decided that what I was asking was too much (it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m currently making actually). One company never even looked at the code and after two weeks, emailed back saying they had forgotten and decided to hire someone else. The third company was pretty responsive and I&#x27;ll be going in for an in-person. A seven hour in-person interview that will be more coding and such (at least on a laptop so it&#x27;s better than most places). So one out of three. I think this is a huge problem with this approach and basically, most companies are not responsible enough to follow this approach.

9161065,comment,9160350,9160880,0,0,skuhn,,,"Yeah, my solution is a gross oversimplification -- my math is just back-of-the-napkin stuff, you can actually do much better on component pricing (I certainly don&#x27;t pay $5000 for a 1G top-of-rack switch) and there are other variables to consider.<p>To quickly address some of your points:<p>Geographic redundancy: not included. From a hardware perspective it&#x27;s a pretty easy upgrade (build two datacenters in CA / VA, buy two racks, put one in each). From a service perspective, it&#x27;s a bit more challenging. If storage is your business, these are the core components you should own though.<p>The US Standard region in S3 does sort of provide geographic redundancy, but it&#x27;s a question of whether it&#x27;s good enough for your use case. S3 is a complete black box, and you have no way of knowing with certainty that every data blob is actually in both geographic regions. Besides that, it&#x27;s eventually consistent, so if you need absolute assurances that data is not lost after a write succeeds, you have to implement logic on top of S3 -- and that logic must run in EC2 instances, or you&#x27;ll pay a fortune in bandwidth to execute it.<p>No other region in S3 provides geographic redundancy (or eventual consistency, the two are related), so if you wanted to deploy storage in Europe or APAC, you have to handle the geographic distribution yourself -- and it will cost double to store that data.<p>The small cost difference: 1 rack over 1 year has a pretty small differential between the two. But you can optimize the datacenter numbers, and the S3 numbers are what they are unless you get massive. For example, over 3 years the datacenter cost goes to around $275,000 whereas S3 is $745,000. That&#x27;s a serious difference now. Ownership is a powerful advantage.<p>OpenStack Swift: I don&#x27;t think it will ever be a good solution, based on the project&#x27;s history. It&#x27;s unfortunate, but hopefully something else will come along that does blob storage in a sane and scalable way. This is not rocket science, but there are some devils in those details. If a mature open source solution came along with immutable objects, erasure coding, background scrubbing and sane ops tools, it would blow Swift out of the water.<p>Finally, I think it&#x27;s a (common) mistake to think that you can get by without ops personnel if you deploy on AWS. The actual site / dc ops component is pretty minor if you build right. Either way, someone still has to run the service, do capacity / project / budget plans, and other things. And with AWS you need people who are capable of winning arguments with their support -- where you will burn substantial time proving where fault lies.<p>S3 does a lot for you, but it&#x27;s still a service that you build yours on top of and it&#x27;s far from a perfect solution that never breaks. Buckets have to be primed before heavy usage. Your file naming scheme will impact your performance at scale. And so on. You need people to look at this, whether you call them ops engineers or sysadmins or developers.",1425704795

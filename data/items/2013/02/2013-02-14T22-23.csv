It took a few days for his technies to compile the blog post, but Tesla did provide the data--it's not doubt for doubt's sake.

In hindsight, that's the obvious conclusion.<p>I wish that Broder had been running a few cameras in the car during the whole trip.  Then we could have some data to compare against Tesla's.

The commune has been functional since the 60s, sucking up its members' wealth in exchange for living under the direction of a charismatic leader. While a generation lived under this leader's direction, their children suffered the brunt of the eccentricity and thoughtlessness that the era inculcated. The one incident that I recall hearing about is when several children (including the person I was dating) in the 8-12 age range were randomly ordered to live with different parents on a whim, and the families complied. A significant fraction of the kids of that generation are somewhat screwed up, with causes ranging from heroin addiction to the effects of sexual abuse as children.

5222946,comment,5220171,5221818,2,0,talmand,,,"Actually it shouldn't create as much drama as it does. In our nation's history, I believe only three elections for President had a disagreement between the Electoral College and the national popular vote. In the vast majority of the elections the system works just fine.<p>The main reason for not having a straight popular vote count is a historical fear of true democracy. Some would say that popular vote leads to mob rule, I being one of them, and that must be avoided. Our own history shows examples of popular vote being used to take advantage of the minority, but that's mostly been on the local and state levels.<p>Our Federal government was partly designed from the beginning to avoid popular vote problems. There are several checks and balances in place to prevent a majority from absolute rule over the minority. We have three branches of government that keep each other in check in many ways. The most confusing in today's terms is Congress. Congress itself is made up of two bodies, the Senate and the House. The House is supposed to be have elected members based on population of the states, meaning they represent the People. The Senate was originally meant to represent the states, not the People, but since they are voted upon directly by the People it ruins the point of the Senate. Many people forget that the original intention of the Senate was to represent the State's interests on the Federal level. That's why there are two Senators per state, each state gets equal vote. A quick look at the powers given to the Senate versus the House shows which each was intended to represent. Congress writes the laws of the land within the restraints as defined by the Constitution, which often they don't follow. The President, who often used to be voted on by the State legislatures, represents the Nation as a whole. But the states currently decide how to choose electors, most choose popular vote within their state, that ultimately vote for President. He/she (one day) signs into law the bills that Congress passes. The third branch, the Supreme Court, decides on whether laws are valid under the Constitution after a series of rulings from lower courts. Arguments can be made on whether they should be rewriting laws or creating new ones from scratch, of which they do. Supreme Court Justices are nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate (see? state's interest on the Federal level), and are given lifetime tenure to try to avoid political influence.<p>To complicate things further, most states follow the Federal government in terms of their design of state level governments. Typically the local levels, city and county/parish, tend to go a much simpler route.<p>So, is it complicated? Yes, it is and that is by design. You can go the quick and easy route of popular vote for major things but history shows that's just a bad idea overall. The system is designed to force people to think, to debate, and to somehow agree before action is taken. Sadly, over the years the system has been degraded in an effort to be ""more fair"" to somebody. Often politicians wish to ""tinker"" with things to make things more fair, as long as it gives them an advantage over their political opponents in some way.<p>Don't feel bad over your confusion, most over here are confused by it as well.<p>Also, the red/blue states thing is drama created by the news media. I would imagine most everyday citizens could care less.",1360881205

Any positive number is better than zero. I'll have to read through the link you gave to see what the guy's reasoning was, but regen should always increase your range.<p>Edit: On reading through some of the links available on Google, I suspect that he didn't specifically try to avoid regen, but just drove too slowly and with too gentle acceleration and deceleration for the regen system to kick in. Regen does require a certain minimum speed and rate of deceleration to achieve a net gain in energy; if you try it when the car is going too slowly or decelerating too gently all the energy goes into losses in the electrical system and none goes to the battery. The car's control system should be calibrated to only allow regen to kick in when there will be a net gain.<p>So in that sense you could say that the less than 100% efficiency means there are times when there's no point in using it. But it never causes a loss of energy; you're never worse off than you would be not using regen. It's just that the car's controls won't bother trying if there's no point.",1360881100

5222924,comment,5220171,5222494,1,0,just2n,,,"> I think you're reaching a bit here. When the Constitution was written there were thirteen states along the East coast. There was no California for an elector to travel from to go to D.C. to cast their vote. I have never heard of the travel time as a reason for the inclusion of the Electoral College in the Constitution. I seriously doubt that's a justifiable reason for such a thing.<p>They were still spread out over thousands of miles of coastline. You're not going to deliver votes efficiently even if you constrict the entire country to the size of a state like New York, because transportation was human/animal powered at the time. This is the historical justification.<p>>I'm curious as to what problems the EC causes that you state were acceptable in the 1800s but are no longer acceptable today. From my perspective the problems would most likely be political in nature. So any problems that existed 200 years ago would much be the same today.<p>Education and dissemination of information makes the problems more widely understood, but it was unlikely that the decision was made by people who understood the flaws in the voting systems, as major theoretical study into voting systems didn't really take off until the mid-late 1800s, and that information wasn't publicly disseminated until the 1900s. It ""just worked"" and was simple, so it was justifiable. These days, we can easily educate ourselves by reading public work in voting theory and see how mathematically bad such a voting system is.  As well, the justifications needed to make electors a necessity no longer exist. This leads to problems as we've already discussed here, such as EC leading to roundoff errors and enabling gerrymandering, which are well understood PROBLEMS caused by the system. So what was acceptable then is no longer acceptable.<p>> I'm not the biggest fan of the EC but I believe it more desirable than true Democracy, as that only leads to mob rule. In that case the states with the highest populations would be in a position to rule over the smaller, less populated states. This was part of the debate of the EC in the first place.<p>This was in a time when the federal government hadn't expanded its role and power, so I highly doubt that argument would've held much weight. Federal systems were in place to prevent that, and it was very, very clear in the constitution that the federal government was to be extremely limited in power, while most power was reserved for states. Every state had equal representation in the senate, amending the constitution wouldn't happen just because one state has more people than another, since their voting power wouldn't influence those systems, so it's hard to see how having more people means you can ""rule over"" smaller, less populous states. The constitution just doesn't permit it. And they still made the electoral college proportionate to the number of people in the state, so that wouldn't have actually prevented what you mention -- the federal framework would've. Except they did the math wrong, and smaller, less populous states have more voting power, and due to problems the electoral college causes, states that are pretty evenly split along party lines, especially less populous ones, are the only important states in any given election, and receive significantly more congressional concessions to win votes. So the electoral college has created a favor imbalance (not really a power imbalance) that results in some states being pampered by congress, while others (particularly large, populous ones) are left to fester, which I'd argue is a pretty crappy outcome if the system was intended to do anything about that.",1360881031

It's closer to the truth that children don't have a legal right to privacy from their parents in their parents' home using their parents' computer and internet connection.<p>This attitude is problematic though. Instead of encouraging a more open dialog between parents and their kids, parents using spyware creates an adversarial relationship.

5222885,comment,5212570,5212570,1,0,phulst,,,"Hi Bert,<p>I felt like I had to respond to this, because our backgrounds are so similar and I was facing the same questions years ago. here's my advice:<p>Travel while you can. You'll learn more valuable life lessons in a year of travelling than you will in 10 years of, well, doing almost anything else. I am Dutch, studied Electrical Engineering too, and left Holland when I was 24. I left for a 1 year working holiday in Australia, but I ended up spending 8 months in New Zealand as well, so was away for 20 months. It turned out it's pretty easy to get a temporary work permit in NZ as well if you have some technical skills, and I was able to fund a much longer trip by doing some consulting for the bank of New Zealand. After 6 months back in Holland, I left again, this time on a one way ticket to Indonesia. After exploring South East Asia for another 10 months, I ended flying to San Francisco to visit the US for the first time, in hopes of being able to find a job in Silicon Valley, make some money there and then move on with my travels. I never moved on.<p>Almost 14 years later, I'm still in the SF bay area, and I am now founder and CEO of my own bootstrapped startup, and an independent software consultant. I'm married, have 2 kids, live in a great place, and have always felt that that decision to go traveling was the best decision I've made in my life. Without those travels, I don't know where I'd be right now, but highly unlikely that it would be here.<p>I think the things you learn by traveling to an unknown place, with unspecified plans, prepare you better for entrepreneurship than pretty much anything you would learn in an office. On the road, you'll learn to be comfortable with the unknown, you'll be forced to look for creative solutions, to pivot when necessary. You'll widen your horizon and expose yourself to new places, other cultures, new ideas. You'll learn valuable social skills, you'll learn to get along with people that you have almost nothing in common with. You'll experience all the benefits of having to venture outside of the fairly small demographic that you are in at home. You'll learn to appreciate and make the best of what you have, however little that may be.\nMaybe I was just lucky, being able to find jobs on the way, and making it to San Francisco at the height of the dot-com boom, when developers were treated like gods and immigrant work visas were easier to come by. But you may be surprised by the random opportunities you will end up walking into if you just go out on a whim, like I did at the time.<p>Some people may have thought of me as a lazy bum as I was roaming around the world, but I always knew that it was the right thing to do for me, and that it would make me a better person, a better dad and a more successful entrepreneur down the line.\nIf you need any more convincing: I've never talked to anyone who regretted going traveling. I've spoken to hundreds of people who regret not having done it before they were tied down by careers, families, mortgages and other adult responsibilities.<p>My advice for you, save up some money, do some consulting and get a little bit of working experience, and then venture out into the unknown. Try to find some work abroad, even if it's unskilled work. (I also picked kiwis in New Zealand and worked in a small factory in Sydney). And then, while you are away, you'll have plenty of time to think about what you want to do with the rest of your life. Or somehow you'll find that those questions will be answered for you.",1360880681

Since then AMD's proprietary driver has caused me semi-regular GPU lockups on R520 (X1650), Evergreen (HD 5670) and Southern Islands (HD 7770) series cards. Nvidia's proprietary drivers seem to have fared better with three generations of their cards (7300 GT, the notorious 8600M GS, GT 240, GTS 250...), with an occasional X server crash when running a video game in Wine but few lockups. On the other hand, in the FOSS world I have experienced the opposite (AMD being better than Nvidia). The worst individual case was setting up GeForce GT 240 to work in Linux Mint 13 last year. The OS wouldn't boot with kernel mode setting on and starting X once it has booted without kernel mode setting gave me a screenful of RGB noise; my solution was to install the proprietary driver in text mode and then write a custom xorg.conf. The drivers for Intel's graphics seem the best so far if you use relatively modern chips (I have tried GMA X3100, GMA 3150, Intel HD Graphics 2000), however, I had no luck trying to get the legacy Intel Extreme Graphics 2 to work. It doesn't really work with Linux 2.6+, resulting in an image that flashes and rolls up and down the screen like a the picture on an analogue TV that's lost the vertical synchronization signal.<p>If my case is in any way typical then I'd say the drivers are in dire need of fixing.<p>Edit: clarity.",1360879399

The record holder weighs in at 53 characters, it (fortunately) drops off quickly after that.<p>There are only 2 things hard in programming, cache invalidation, naming things and off by one errors.<p>Personally I think this name is bad because in spite of the enormous length it <i>still</i> doesn't tell me what it actually does. It just uses a lot of characters to indicate its spot in a hierarchy.<p>Names like these are what gave rise to jokes like 'Q: What is the spelling of bureaucracy? A: J-a-v-a'. Which of course does a dis-service to java the language and the community behind it.<p>I can see why they're funny, but you have to realize that when you get out of the trivial program length domain into projects that are 100's of thousands of lines that this problem will sooner or later rear its ugly head. And I have not yet seen any really good solutions.<p>The things that can help you to extend your runway a bit in this respect are:<p><pre><code>   - be consistent\n\n   - reduce scope wherever possible\n\n   - pick short names for primary objects\n</code></pre>\nBut even with those rules you'll have a 53 letter name in there somewhere... I'd be very wary of casting stones in situations like these without knowing exactly how the person that picked it originally made their choice. Chances are there were a whole pile of external factors dictating this monstrosity and the guy or girl (or the code generator!) that did it never was happy about it either. Laughing at others that have tackled some problem is easy. Coming up with real solutions and doing a better job of it is a lot harder.",1352676511

How much you care about the worst case vs the average case is in the utility function. That's exactly the problem with frequentist methods: you're still making assumptions, but they are implicit and hardcoded in your choice of method, instead of explicitly stated and tweakable. With a particular choice of prior and utility function, you can recover many frequentist methods, but in most cases those will not be the prior and utility function you actually want. For example maximum likelihood estimation corresponds to a utility function equal to the likelihood (i.e. the probability mass), which at the very least should strike you as ridiculous for continuous quantities (maximum likelihood can still be useful as an <i>approximation</i> technique if the problem is intractable with your actual utility function). With a frequentist method, you <i>are</i> using a prior, you just don't know which one.<p>For some problems you might be able to get the correct decision in a very roundabout way by setting your alpha to the right magic value, but (1) it's not clear how to find the right alpha and (2) in general you cannot encode a complete utility function into a single number.",1352675629

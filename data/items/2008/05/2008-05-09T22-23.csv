185998,comment,185729,185896,0,0,ftravis,,,"I think you're confounding ""nobody is doing what we're doing"" with ""nobody is competing with us"". You're right to say that no competitors sometimes means no market. On the other hand, it's only wise to enter markets where you have some important differentiating factor between your product and the competition.<p>Look at it this way:
Google had lots of competitors, but nobody was doing what they were doing.",1210373347

185993,comment,185450,185722,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I had this disposition as well. A friend of mine challenged me on it though. He said that there's an alternative explanation -- that someone learning something difficult for the first time needs to achieve some small successes to successfully keep going. Those who are slightly more talented are slightly more likely to make it past the first static hurdle, but more importantly, being a little better than your peers, or impressing others is a big enough victory to keep you going a while longer. He suggested that talented people can attain the successes more easily and so can maintain the motivation for much longer.<p>I wonder about this. In most of the big things I've done, courage seems the limiting factor. I find working on something of my own fairly interesting regardless of the subject matter. Could it be that it's my own conception of myself as capable that's been pulling me through?",1210372903

185990,comment,185809,185809,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"From the article: ""Libraries are key. Think about it: most programming tasks involve organizing and gluing together library code; most programming tasks do not involve the creation of novel algorithms that compel the use of sophisticated programming language constructs (emphasis on most --- I do admit that the benefits of a more powerful or applicable language are greater when one is trying to solve harder problems).""<p>The author seems to completely miss the fact that you can have semantically dense high-level languages act as the glue between libraries implemented in whatever language they happen to be written in.<p>""Those who don't understand UNIX are doomed to reinvent it.""<p>The notion of using the best tool for the job is correct, and the notion of chosing the best libraries is correct, but the assumption that you must use Foo to consume libraries written in Foo to construct a program is wrong.<p>One of the metrics we don't see enough (IMHO) chatter about is how well languages play well with others.<p>There are SEVERAL ways to accomplish integration.<p>At the moment, I enjoy using JRuby because ruby has minimal pain and java has a cornucopia (glut?) of libraries.  Things like the translation of MIPS machine code to JVM bytecode are interesting, but I need to check them out more before I recommend them.",1210372847

We offered them a chance to be a significant part of a  small team, trying to pull off the impossible.<p>As a student--especially from the top schools--I think you are more interested in a good summer experience where you learn alot. Not lots of pay or potential for options.<p>If you can convince them that they will learn alot more in a life-or-death struggle w/ you guys and create software used by thousands of ppl the next day rather than sitting bored in a windowless cubicle writing some code no one will ever use....you are all set.<p>If they need cash, they should do other stuff. If they want to test their limits, they should throw their lot in with you. :)<p>Be careful tho. Unless you get stellar interns, they are usually more work than they are worth. By the time they ramp up, they are about to quit and go back to school. Just think about what you did during your summer internship and you'll see what I mean.

Conventional AI will never reach human levels of intelligence.  2.  To understand how human intelligence works we need to discover new physics - most likely in the area of quantum mechanics.<p>It all hangs, not on quantum mechanics, but on his initial assertion.  I've read his explanation in Shadows of the Mind, but the lightbulb didn't go on for me.  For McArthy to dismiss the question offhand was a little disappointing.

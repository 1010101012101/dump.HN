1272893,comment,1272306,1272834,0,0,zppx,,,"The LGPL adopted by Webkit is much more restrictive than the MPL adopted by gecko (gecko still adopts GPL and LGPL, just because them it can link with GPL software), if you're blaming gecko for supporting Theora but not H.264 I must remember that the WebKit codebase do not includes an H.264 codec, it's Apple and Google that link the codec against webkit, any application that uses the bare WebKit will have to include its own version of the H.264 code, that said technically webkit is advancing much faster than gecko in some areas (WebGL for example).<p>Concerning gcc, were you reading the mailing list of the gcc project for the last 20 years or so? What you said about Stallman is a fairly serious accusation, and as such must be supported with facts, as far as I know Stallman wasn't even important among gcc developers in the last 10 years, also in the very beginning gcc was intended to be the compiler of the GNU system, the technical reality for compilers in the 80s was probably different from now.",1271501222

Look at Emacs, for example.  That thing can't do anything Stallman didn't originally intend.<p>Try again.",1271501063

I don't even think things like 'good web design' really crossed my mind.  At least not in the way that you see those ""top n ways how to code a modern website"" type of articles.

You wouldn't have all the latency of doing multiple reads on the device to find a file. Normally the CPU would have interrupt raised for each return of the read but with this it could just request a file and get the return in one go.",1271499195

1272862,comment,1272807,1272807,0,0,hammerdr,,,"His example is a poor one. The phone system was far from open and the hacking that Woz was doing against it was very much illegal.<p>Instead, the availability of these types of devices (iPhone, Smartphones) has increased the level of technical knowledge in every day society. For example, there are more people that know how to jailbreak an iPhone than there are hackers. For some non-technical people, this very technical process has become something commonplace.<p>The reports from DARPA and the US Air Force are suspect in their relevance to this discussion. There are several factors that could weigh upon their low projections: military recruitment rate is down in the US and there is general displeasure with the government.<p>Also, computer science has become ubiquitous in several fields. For example, all of the majors at my engineering university are required to take some form of computer science. Creating tools and solving problems with software has become an everyday part of any engineers' tool belt. Perhaps the hackers are migrating to domain specific areas?<p>And, finally, that doesn't mean we should be complacent. It is still (and always will be) our charge to engage younger generations in the fulfillment and excitement that comes from solving tough problems.",1271499060

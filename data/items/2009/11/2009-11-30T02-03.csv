967243,comment,966159,966697,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Erlang's style was <i>very</i> strongly influenced by Prolog, and in Prolog code, it's quite common to see e.g. ""X1 = X + 1"", but having X2, X3, etc. as well is rare - there's usually not a succession of modified versions of a variable in the same function (clause), because it's a sign that you could break things up better. The same is true in Erlang - code with several such variables is written with a strong Java accent (or whatever), not in idiomatic Erlang.",1259549670

967235,comment,967218,967231,0,0,unalone,,,"Heh. I disagree with you on both counts. Guess it goes to show how varying individual tastes are.<p>I like the blue buttons. They're very playful, which is what Google wants. I also like that they don't look like ordinary OS X buttons on the Mac anymore. They're tasteful blues, not particularly tacky. I also like the border colors of the search bar.<p>However, the sidebar seems cluttered to me. The design seems cramped, and I hate the whitespace between the highlighted option and the 1px blue bar on the right. Something also seems off with the top/bottom padding vs. the font size on those buttons. Overall the site feels more cramped and less quietly useful than early Google with its single row of links.<p>I agree with you on the logo, though. I also like where the ""About 128,000,000 results (0.35 seconds)"" is positioned, as well as the Advanced Search placement. So half really good, half bleh.",1259549223

I would echo many of the comments here to go outside academia and CS and focus on what you have learned by coding for pay and pleasure.<p>How to build your personal online coder reputation, begin contributing to the community (open source, blogging) - focus on what you personally have done/not done and your experiences good and bad with sharing and collaborating. And what's it like starting? or working at a startup<p>My point here is focus on experiences that have made you learn. Come in as peers who have been out in the external-college real world and tell them about the real world (calibrate their expectations)<p>I think most of the students are expecting a standard tech briefing, and I challenge you to switch it up on them. Promise some soup du jour tech topic but change it to talking about the real business world (change it after audience is seated so you get the students who probably would have skipped a real-world/business topic oriented lecture).<p>One of the most valuable lectures I've ever crashed was one for Ch.Eng seniors on how to get the job you really, really want.

967231,comment,967218,967218,0,0,NathanKP,,,"Personally I think that the logo itself looks more professional.  However those bright blue buttons are too much.  The old gray buttons were more attractive.<p>The sidebar, however, is impeccable.  The instant and available filtering options are incredibly useful.<p>Edit:<p>I just noticed something fascinating.  The old Google linked from the SERP through a proxy link which redirected to the actual result.  The new Google links directly from the SERP to the result.  In other words you can now copy a link from the SERP and have it be the actual address of the result, not just the address of a Google redirect to the result.",1259548915

For example, I predicted without even reading that Twitter adoption is so low as to be negligible.  The data referenced elsewhere on this thread suggests that, indeed, .5% of customers are using it.  Don't spend engineering time catering to .5% of customers unless you have a darn good reason to.  (In addition to Twitter, the vast majority of your customers don't have blogs.  Unlike Twitter, though, I think there is a built-in wonderful reason to support bloggers even if they're a tiny fraction of your users: they give great links for SEO purposes.)<p>Easily importing contacts from their Yahoo email or Google email, which are products this market actually uses, is a wonderful idea though.<p>Have you thought deeply about your SEO strategy yet, as opposed to your paid search strategy?  I think you'll find that search results like ""family photos"" are going to be insanely competitive.  Think long tail -- put a blog on your site and start writing articles along the general lines of ""How do I send photos to my family?""  You would be flabbergasted how many people in your market do natural language queries.  (The long tail search queries at my site is <i>quite</i> amusing.)",1259548091

If it is about demonstrating the team's skills at solving a well specified problem, the choice of language should be part of the solution, not the problem statement.

But that is precisely why you ought to let the teams make their own choices, good or bad.<p>On the other hand, if you are interested in leveling the playing field and removing rote skills, you might consider specifying a language with which the teams are unfamiliar such as go, erlang, clojure, or the like.

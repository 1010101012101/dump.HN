7949143,comment,7948310,7948577,4,0,ww520,,,"I think you&#x27;ve confused what mutable state is.  The cell values entered by a user are input values.  The derived value of a cell bases on the computation of other cells, which is not changed once computed.  When a user changes an input value in a cell, a new round of computation of the whole spreadsheet is started.  The input value are not mutable state during computation.  The modal of computation of a spreadsheet is pretty much stateless.<p>The computation between cells are done by the declaring formulas and cell dependency.  The order of computation or how the computation is carried out is not specified, which is what declarative programming is.<p>The input cells and derived cells are pretty much like the tables and computed views in a RDBMS, where SQL is a declarative language to define the view.",1403783870

A military convoy is being attacked by a remotely controlled IED, you can retaliate by sending a drone to blow up some pre-defined target. Maybe it is a fitting weapon for the twenty-first century, to put back some symmetry in asymmetric wars. The next logical step is the use of drones to perform terrorist attacks.

To better extend dimable. Also it would be nice if it recognized that there was no one in the room and shut the lights or turn them on when someone walks in. Special care needs to be done when watching tv in order to dim the lights accordingly.<p>* Automatic shutters that can be handled as the lights controls. Could be nice if they learned when to actually shut ( when there is too much sun and the AC is running, or when the heat is working and it is day ).<p>* Media centrer functionality. This is nice and can easily be done by a central pc and instances of XBMC using a shared library. With raspberry this is the cheapest automation that can be done.<p>* Smart door, recognize who is at my door and grant access to me or anyone i have added to the list. When someone hits the door, send me something to my phone so i can know who is there. Add me the capability to open the door remotely.<p>* Smart heating like Nest seems to be doing. Never went into much detail about that.<p>* Security system. A good security system is essential. Monitor with camera and report any activity that is in the house when the system is on. Let me know when there is no power, no internet, or someone interacted with the alarm system.<p>* A smart fridge as someone else wrote here. If it can know in what stuff i am running low on and send me an email that i am running low on this that would be super (doesnt yet exist)<p>* Info graphics, in what is going on my house. Where is the majority of the power been used ? How many people visited my house ? and many more.",1403783468

This was valid ... for Ariane IV. &quot;Don&#x27;t terminate the process on integer overflow&quot; is not allowed by the specification.<p>It&#x27;s incorrect to attribute the problem to an overflow exception. Rather, it&#x27;s equally correct to say that it was a design fault (because that functionality simply wasn&#x27;t needed for Ariane V) or an analysis fault (because the overflow could have been detected that way) or a testing fault (because testing with simulated Ariane V inputs would have revealed the fault).<p>If there was a random hardware failure in SR-2 then a shutdown, to only use SR-1 would have been fine. But SR-1 was subject to the same failure condition, because it used the same code. So it&#x27;s equally valid to say that the failure was in not using two independent implementations, as a mitigation for simple coding errors.<p>Hence the report says the problem was &quot;due to specification and design errors in the software of the inertial reference system&quot;, and does not place the blame only on the triggering event.

7949076,comment,7942031,7948610,1,0,Dewie,,,"> Why preserve culture? You answer still comes down to &quot;because we can&#x27;t lose it&quot;.<p>Why have cultures? Because it increases the diversity of thought and ideas. This diversity in turn can inspire each other and create new impulses, ideas, ways of thinking. This diversity is severely limited - and in turn how much it can influence and inspire other cultures - if they simply disappear. It&#x27;s like taking all the work and time it took, for perhaps thousands of years, to create that culture, and simply destroying it.<p>Another reason is that I think that it&#x27;s a shame for majority, dominant cultures to simply swallow up minority cultures. If the people of that minority culture want to preserve it, I think they should stand a chance.<p>Lastly, I think it&#x27;s a worthy end onto itself. This is the end-road of socratic reasoning. Would you say that it is frivolous to just say &quot;because it is worthy in itself&quot;? Well, this is how all arguments end up, anyway. Just like your argument might end up with the assumption that &quot;convenience and less struggle to communicate is worthy in itself&quot;. But then I can say, &quot;a little struggle and inconvenience in communication is part of the fun! We should preserve our differences for that reason&quot;.<p>> The other side of the coin is it&#x27;s being done at the expense of forcing all minority language speakers to be economically disadvantaged. Great news if you&#x27;re an American, not so great if you&#x27;re a Nepalese. I have to disagree with you there. You haven&#x27;t shown any reason why a member of a minority culture should be excluded from most of society and prevented from even learning modern knowledge, reading literature, or even understanding the ways of thinking of most of the world.<p>Nonsense. Do you know how many people speak two, three and so on languages? How many people who speak a minority language in some country, also speak some majority language? The same goes for speaking a native, minority, or whatever language, and speaking English (or perhaps French or Portuguese etc., depending on where they are in the world).<p>I have to emphasize that I would never condone <i>forcing</i> people to practice and learn a language. It should be by their own volition. If they don&#x27;t want to practice it, then that is of course entirely up to them. Just as I wouldn&#x27;t force them or encourage them to give up their language (and perhaps in turn also their culture) in favour of some international standard language.<p>> This is why I favor storing languages in museums, rather than burdening millions of innocent people with the job they didn&#x27;t even sign up for.<p>Is that so.",1403782557

And it REALLY depends on which state (in the USA) you are in. Florida for example is a no-fault state. Which means, basically, insurance companies are on the hook for the first 10k. Which is about how much it coast to mend a broken leg. Anything above that requires a lawsuit. And you don&#x27;t sue the insurance company. You are suing a person (or company).<p>Lawsuits take time. Lots of time.<p>A taxi driver in Florida has different requirements. So does the company he drives for. The amount they pay out is much higher. Also, not every issue requires a lawsuit. Sometime you just get a bad driver. With Uber, who you gonna complain too? Uber?<p>In most states, complaining to the taxi commission is a serious offense and has to be answered by the driver and company he drives for.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with Uber itself. If people want to drive others around, fine. BUT totally unfair to require taxi drivers to be licensed and not the Uber drives. It&#x27;s unfair to make the taxi driver (and company) have much higher insurance requirements than Uber and it&#x27;s divers. And it&#x27;s unfair to the rider. If you are in an Uber car and you have a wreck; you better hope that driver has more then &quot;what&#x27;s minimum&quot; for insurance. Chances are, he doesn&#x27;t.

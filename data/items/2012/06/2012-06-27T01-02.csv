They stuff the exchanges with quotes and eventually cause a huge latency with respect to the quotes that are shown by the exchange, such as NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.  However, they aren't affected because they can see the prices because they have a raw data feed.  This gives them an edge relative to the other traders that don't have their own raw feed straight from the exchanges, and they use that to basically shoot fish in a barrel.<p>This was one of the main causes for the flash crash in 2010.  The excessive quotes<p>The thing is that they could stop this by implementing a minimum time for a quote to exist, something innocuous like 100 ms, but they don't because this would be a detriment to the HFT shops.<p>The other thing is that HFT shops behave like market makers, and they claim to provide liquidity, however, they have no obligation to provide liquidity, like real market makers.  So just like during the flash crash, they turned off their machines, and the markets went haywire.  So they want their cake and eat it too.  If they are going to trade like market makers, they need to have the obligation to continue to provide liquidity.",1340762322

4165095,comment,4163124,4163124,11,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Should be Titled: ""Why Meditation Doesn't Directly Increase MY Happiness"".<p>For me it does but I practice a very different and rare form of meditation. I can only call it ""Sleeping Awake"". Which took a while to achieve.<p>Basically, when you go to sleep at night your body slows its breathing & heart rate and you loose feeling of your limbs, while your mind looses consciousness and you black out. Your body and mind shut down at the same time. With meditation, particularly deep meditation (out of body experience / trance / hypnosis) you ""sleep awake"". Your body shuts down and goes to sleep but you are completely conscious the entire time. You can't feel your limbs, heart beat, or lungs breathing. You completely loose track of time and gravity and feel like you're floating around in a massive black, empty, nothingness.<p>If feels like you're floating around in the universe before it was made. Completely empty and quiet. No gravity. No direction. No time. No space. No memories. No emotions. No body. No flesh. It's the most peace you'll ever experience in your life apart from sleep and death. There's absolutely nothing on your mind. The only thing you're aware of, is your existence. That's all. And when you wake up, you feel amazingly refreshed. Not just physically but mentally. For me personally, I feel content and happy the rest of the day.<p>It makes me happy because the experience reminds me that, honestly, I don't matter. None of us do. We might matter to each other, but to the universe (which is mostly empty) our existence is worthless, useless, meaningless, purposeless. No matter what happens in your life, good or bad. Existence goes on, even after life is gone. And this concept, that nothing really matters, just takes a huge load off your shoulders. I don't know why ""Sleeping Awake"" evokes these feelings but it just does. It's a very calming and neutral experience.<p>So meditation for me did the opposite of what it did to the author of the article. It allowed me to control my emotions much more and see things from a neutral point of view. It allowed me to think, and observe an event or thought BEFORE reacting to it with an opinion or emotion.",1340761249

How is buying something one second and selling the next inherently different than buying one day and selling the next? Speed?<p>Does computers being faster make it any more unfair than when one trader has access to millions or billions of dollars when I only have access to hundreds or thousands? I don't think so.<p>Now, one could argue that HFT disrupts the way that Wall Street has worked for decades, but really, it is shifting the profit from traders, bankers, and fund managers to HFT firms. Sure, Wall Street probably doesn't like it, but does anyone like it when someone disrupts their market and takes their profit?<p>You could also argue that HFT doesn't add value because HFT firms inherently don't do anything other than trade millions of stocks only for the sake of trading them, but how is this worse than day trading or running any other fund other than the turnover rate?<p>Perhaps I'm blind to the real issues, but I just don't see a huge difference between HFT and traditional Wall St. trading, except maybe that it magnifies the problems inherent in the system due to speed and scale.",1340761001

Honestly I don't know if that's true but their mobile website has almost the exact same UX. There's a few subtle differences but maybe those come from some glue around a webview and not all brand new code.",1340759404

I can tell you that moving many multiples of racked equipment via semi-truck from one datacenter to another is not an enjoyable experience.<p>Ping - Power - Pipe :  Ask everything you need.  If a datacenter is unwilling to share or discuss
who they are, what they do and what they offer then walk away.  Colocation is a buyer beware environment.<p>Here's a VERY ROUGH list/braindump of questions that AT THE VERY LEAST you need to know before placing equipment with the colocation provider/datacenter.<p>Tier I,II,III, IV datacenter?
Who owns the datacenter? Investors?

Straight $mbps/month?
Who manages your network?
Ip allotment? Assignment procedure?  High density for micro vms(Heroku style)? 200 VMs per host meaning 200IPs per vm. 
Swip/rwhois updates on assignments?
Cross-connects?
Cross connect pricing? Charges? Local loop(last mile connectivity) charges?
BGP support?
Is our traffic on a private/separate v-lan from your other customers?<p>Infrastructure? -Redundancy in detail -Brands
	-Networking
	-Connection
	-Power.
Maintenance programs?<p>A/B feeds from two separator breakers or breaker panels or better yet two Utility Power Service Provider if they are truly A/B feeds.
A/B Diesel-Generators?
Additional fuel storage on site?
Is a PDU included? If so, how many outlets and is it accessible from the web or telnet?
What type of hand off/drops to your rack will you be provided (Ethernet)?
Are there raised floors?
Are there any fire suppression systems in place?
Physical/Video Security? Biometrics?
Screening of employees?<p>Insurance requirements to colocate equipment with you?<p>On-site visit requirements?
24x7 staffing?
Remote Hands - Cost and Abilities?  What's included?
Shipping/Receiving of hardware?<p>Sas II 70 or SSAE 16 certification? Audit available for review?
	-Common practices
		-Staffing
		-Security
		-Emergencies - Escalations
		-Contacts
Outage alerts? Notifications through Twitter or similar offsite status page?
RFOs for past outages? What's been your corrective action?<p>Power density per rack?
80% rule or true metered?
Can you rack the equipment for us?
Who provides cabling?
Types of rails for servers?
Billing-95th or other?
Rack size?  Partitioning available? 4u/10u/Quarter/Half? Cages? Lockable or baker's racks? Shared with others?<p>Finally, ask for a listing of ALL fees.",1340759357

MasterCard blocking WikiLeaks payments, Dropbox blocking torrents, PayPal banning a VPN provider... Private companies have no business deciding what is ""acceptable"" in this manner. If it's illegal for them to provide services, then obviously they can't, but if it isn't, then they should continue to provide services.<p>Honestly, is this any different from a company ninety years ago denying service to non-whites because it ""could be perceived as encouraging the races to intermarry?""<p>There's a reason we have anti-discrimination laws for races, gender, orientation and religion.

I think awesome HTFs and algo traders have a very similar skillset to top notch startup hackers.<p>Small prop shops ARE startups. You:<p><pre><code>    1. wear a lot of hats
    2. release early, release often
    3. write really fast code, really fast
    4. validate theories against the market (or consumers)
    5. if you're right, keep going, if not, pivot
    6. success is dependent on understanding lots of different sub-specialties
    7. lots of overlapping skills: big data, distributed computing, machine learning

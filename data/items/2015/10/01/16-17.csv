It varies a lot across the country, but this has been true for a lot of Mexico&#x27;s history. It may look crazy to us, but the political establishment has always been a part of whatever makes money in Mexico; it just happens to be drugs these days.<p>The sad part is how cheaply the lives of these young people, including the future school teachers of this part of Mexico, were thrown away.  In a podunk place like Iguala, where literally every state and local was on the payroll with the cartels, the apparent desperation at having a drug-carrying bus discovered galvanized not just the police, not just the 27th Battalion, but EVERYBODY, to slaughter anybody they could find on a bus.  They appear to have been more organized about this mass murder than they were about anything else in their sorry careers &quot;protecting&quot; the people of Mexico.<p>Every time I feel disgusted about the state of politics in the United States, I should remind myself of what Churchill said about our system: it&#x27;s the worst, except for all the others.",1443718616

The web is a medium.  Ascribing freedom to it is a fallacy, regardless of how it was first developed and used.  It would not be where it is today without commercial interest at <i>every</i> level, and to me it&#x27;s obvious that when a business is on the web, their purpose is not to give you free stuff, it&#x27;s to make money[1].  I think to assume otherwise it to delude oneself. In other words, the internet doesn&#x27;t have an opinion on whether it should be used for free things or not.<p>> And the other thing is I have never seen a site that asks me not to use it if I block ads, a request I fully respect.<p>Depending on how you interpret the message, I have.  I&#x27;ve seen messages where the ads would be saying &quot;We support this site with advertising, without thatrevenue we can&#x27;t continue.  Please don&#x27;t block our ads.&quot;  You can choose to either interpret that as them whining, or you can choose to interpret it as them expressing their wishes that ads be viewed on the site, and to use it with an ad blocker is against their wishes.<p>1: For that matter, <i>nothing</i> is free, <i>ever</i>.  There is always an intended purpose, and an intended gain for the exchange.  That gain may not be directly from the other party, and may not be financially based.  For example, the gain could be the opinion of the other party or society in general (social capital, fame), a long play on later financial gain (establishing relationships), or the feeling of doing something useful for society or specific others (personal esteem), etc.  If you can&#x27;t determine why something is being offered, then you should be wary.",1443718578

My case started like yours, I was fine and then suddenly I started getting really tired and felt like I was mentally in a cloud. My work suffered dramatically. I had minor pain in my guts (that occurred sporadically) and usually went away when I went to the bathroom. I chucked this up to constipation. After mentioning this all to my doctor, he recommended me to a Gastroenterologist, who, after a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy, identified ulcerations and inflammation in my bowels. I ended up having a weird case of Crohn&#x27;s disease. This struck me as odd, because my guts never really were the issue (I was constipated rather than the constant diarrhea), it was mostly my head. But it turns out the Crohn&#x27;s can lead to deficiencies which can affect your mental state, namely fatigue and cloudiness. After a month or so on steroids (endicort), I started feeling much better, although I am still no where close to where I was before this all started happening. The reason I being up your age, is that Crohn&#x27;s usually starts in people who are in their twenties.",1443718562

Insurance, originally, was about being able to reliably get the expected value out of something whose outcome would vary.  Take a ship, for instance:  ten ships go to the East Indies, three return laden with spice, seven sink.  Expected value:  some spice.  So, you pool <i>homogenous</i> risks and investors can expect a more reliable income, less a fee for the broker and all the rest.<p>I would argue the word has been bent and beaten far out of its original shape into something close to what you&#x27;re talking about, especially in health.  It&#x27;s not insurance as much as assurance.  You don&#x27;t pay in early in life to get the expected value later in life.  That would be insurance.  You fight to try and get more than you deserve when you&#x27;re above the life expectancy, if you&#x27;re good at paperwork.  If you&#x27;re bad at paperwork or a smoker, you&#x27;re the one whose early death frees the medical resources and insurance money needed to pay for the one who&#x27;s good at paperwork, less a fee for the broker and all the rest.<p>In this second meaning of &quot;insurance&quot; you&#x27;re right, the point is totally defeated because nobody will want to &quot;insure&quot; a sickly old man&#x27;s health just as nobody in their right mind will write fire insurance for a cigarette.",1443718275

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely).

We&#x27;re slowly hiring mid-level and senior full stack developers (one every couple of months), but our next hire or two will be focused on app dev!  We have patient and clinician apps that need to be re-worked and greatly expanded (to navigate a diverse medical record), and we&#x27;ve been working for a while now on a maternity app that takes the midwives and mother all the way through a pregnancy.  That app is based on AppGyver Steroids (which in turn is built around Cordova), so you should be able to jump into that fairly easily.  We&#x27;re thus working with JavaScript, WebSQL, jQuery, backbone, HTML/CSS.  Extra points if you&#x27;ve dealt with large/complex apps and managing data offline (and the complexity that comes with synching periodically with the server, where new data may come from either the app or the server);<p>For the server side -- apps authenticate with OAuth2, speaking JSON to a REST API; our server-side back end and webapp are primarily Java-based, gradually being refactoring towards a microservice structure.  So if you&#x27;re interested in helping out as well implementing new REST calls as needed, Java experience will ease that path.<p>More about PKB<p>I&#x27;ve worked in a lot of different sectors since I first started writing code in the late 90s, including education, b2b supply chains, POS systems, e-commerce, banking, and anti-spam.<p>PKB has been head-and-shoulders above the rest in everything I care about.<p>We&#x27;re building something that actively, directly, improves the lives of people in general -- not selling more stuff, helping others sell more stuff, or making comfortable people a bit more comfortable. If you&#x27;re interested in PKB&#x27;s growth, funding, profitability, contracts, etc., ask -- our CEO is also active on HN. I&#x27;m in the CTO role.<p>We&#x27;re pragmatic about work/life balance. I work from France, or sometimes from Malaysia, where my in-laws live. Almost half of the developers have small children at home -- personally, I get my kids up in the morning, and I&#x27;m with them entirely late-afternoon & evening (while my wife works), then I fill in some extra hours around the edges as needed. We&#x27;re collaboratively figuring out what works (e.g., how many working hours should you overlap to collaborate effectively?), and planning our lives and our work around what&#x27;s effective, not around some photocopied list of rules stapled to a cubicle wall. One of our developers only codes part time (and occasionally takes long leaves of absence), because he&#x27;s also a theatre director.<p>Culture -- we live in various parts of the UK, central France, Bangalore, Vienna, Budapest, NYC and Costa Rica; we range in age (though I don&#x27;t actually know everyone&#x27;s ages, so I can&#x27;t say exactly!). We&#x27;re not all native English speakers -- but communication skills trump even technical skills for remote teams, so we all understand, speak and write English easily and with the confidence to interrupt if we didn&#x27;t catch something. We collaborate, not compete -- let ideas fight it out, but we&#x27;re on the same team. We like to laugh (but jokes stay tasteful), we share stories of what we did over the weekend (but these don&#x27;t normally end &quot;then I passed out&quot;).<p>If we sound like a good match, get in touch: <a href=""https://www.patientsknowbest.com/careers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.patientsknowbest.com/careers.html</a> (I&#x27;m also contactable directly -- see profile -- but I get a lot of email).

I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good way to evaluate this: <a href=""https://users.rust-lang.org/t/lets-talk-about-ecosystem-documentation/2791"" rel=""nofollow"">https://users.rust-lang.org/t/lets-talk-about-ecosystem-docu...</a><p>Other thoughts:<p>Crates.io, our package server, uses Rust + Ember. One thing that is really interesting about Rust in this space is memory usage: last I heard, crates.io uses a flat ~30 MB of RAM, resident. I&#x27;m used to Rails where that is... very different.<p>On that note, I think &quot;Rust serving JSON + Javascript for the frontend&quot; is a really interesting stack. I&#x27;ve been trying to find the time (and hopefully roping another person or two in) to build a <a href=""http://jsonapi.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsonapi.org/</a> library for this purpose.

Serde is so much nicer.<p>As always with a young ecosystem, we need more libraries. For everything. It&#x27;s gotten a lot better, and much of the basics are there, but sometimes, you&#x27;re still going to have to write things yourself, which slows things down.<p>mio is gaining preliminary Windows support, and once it does, hyper will roll it in, which should significantly improve performance in many web contexts, as well.<p>I largely come from Ruby, where Rails was such a leap forward that people learned Ruby just to use it.

It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It provides a ton of control and insight to the team that operates our clients&#x27; campaigns; it&#x27;s truly the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.\nThis role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>#Position 2: Data Savvy, Impeccably Responsible<p>We need someone to help our Data Science team operations. You&#x27;ll help us maintain and activate various data-driven ad targeting. For example, a client may provide us a billion records which we need to analyze and transform into an audience segment. This isn&#x27;t a software engineering position, but you&#x27;ll want to be (or learn to be) pretty capable at the command line, and able to work with Python/Bash or other scripting languages. More than anything, we want someone who can maintain order among various client-facing tasks. On paper, we have a neat structured process; in reality, we need someone with sound judgement and above-average clarity of thought and word to help drive us forward. If you like combing through data in Excel, R or similar, this might be a great fit. If you&#x27;ve wanted the opportunity to get your hands on large amounts of data from an analysis or management perspective, please reach out to us.<p>-- Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",1443716211

When the lease neared expiration, they offered me a new lease at around $800/mo.  I tossed that in the garbage, and moved before my last month was up, to a much worse place that was only $500/mo.  (You can buy a lot of mousetraps and roach baits with an extra $125/mo.)<p>The last week of the month, I got a call from the old landlords.  They said they hadn&#x27;t received a signed copy of their lease renewal.  I asked why they thought I would accept such a huge increase in rent.  They said they had just renovated the place before I moved in.  I laughed at them, told them I&#x27;d give the keys back on the last day of my current lease, so please be prepared to return my security deposit, and hung up.<p>I&#x27;d like to imagine that the apartment went vacant for a few months after that, and they cried into their pillows every night because of it, but that wasn&#x27;t very likely.  The apartment market had a pretty rapid turnover back then, so it was probably only empty a few weeks.<p>In my view, that huge price hike was a clear GTFO/FOAD signal.  But the university undergraduate education market is much less competitive than the apartment rental markets, and the cost to going to a competitor much higher, so it&#x27;s no surprise that they can get away with higher and more frequent price hikes.",1443716150

Anything you load into the browser, both in terms of size and additional http requests, is a performance hit.<p>Obfuscation helps improve performance speed by making the variables as small as possible while avoiding name collisions. In practice this probably means a file full of one-letter variables, instead of things like elemResult<p>Every byte that is in your Javascript that has to be downloaded to the client is another millisecond or more of response time. This is the reason why I wouldn't use huge honking JS libraries unless I was really sure I needed them (call me old-fashioned). Interestingly enough, looks like there is a case to be made for package libraries, where you download one file and it explodes into both the CSS and JS part of your app. Makes sense to me, although I've never tried it.",1194468909

3018028,comment,3017826,3017826,1,0,ctdonath,,,"Because, understandably, everyone wants the very best (usually equating to the most expensive) health care services & products available. We would self-limit this to reflect our income, assets and credit limits, but as that still doesn't buy the care we want/need/demand, we all pool our resources into insurance funds so those of us needing more than we can afford can buy it (trust me, I know, having gone from ""you need heart surgery"" to the O.R. in 10 days flat). This increases the demand for expensive services, and the ability to pay for them. By sharing the costs, we all can access more expensive services as needed - and, by the way, we find the overall costs rising as a consequence.<p>It's the natural supply-and-demand consequence of spreading costs to achieve manageable payments, same as mortgages (would you buy a quarter-million-dollar house for cash? how about paying over 30 years, plus a little interest?) and student loans (would you sign up for a degree program if you couldn't pay for it now? if you could pay over 20 years?) People make arrangements to pay for what they otherwise couldn't afford (thank you, accountants), which has the natural consequence of raising the prices since more people can now afford limited resources.<p>Prices keep going up until the supply-and-demand equilibrium is reached, which changes every time there's a new way for people to finagle payments so they can get what they couldn't before.",1316533838

It says right on page 673 of the manual not to click that button twice without at least six intervening seconds - and it's even in bold!<p>More seriously: yes, what they are complaining about is that the IRS is finally trying to collect. So one could claim that ""they are complaining because the law is finally being enforced"", and be technically correct. The important point here though is that the law (as with many American laws) is somewhat nonsensical, and therefore relies on the enforcers to use their own best judgement (<i>cringe</i>) and not do anything brain-dead and/or clearly outside the spirit of the law (which was meant to keep then-millionairs, now-billionairs from leaving the country to escape back taxes).<p>Additionally. In general, you can hardly expect the finest citizen to have an understanding of the law even approaching what one might reasonably call ""adequate"". Aside from the bloated body of legislation passed by Congress (where previous laws are often modified by lines like ""replacing the word 'as' of section 4, subparagraph 3, with the word 'of'), one must also contend with case law (i.e. precedents set by courts - harder to understand and arguably more important), regulations (have more of a direct impact on individuals, are thankfully somewhat easier to comprehend, but there are /way/ more), and the occasional executive order (500-word sentences, anybody?). And that's just at the national level - state and local governing bodies are their own legal morass. And, of course, if you leave the country, you get to deal with extradition treaties and, quite likely, whatever treaties are most relevant to your ""crime"" - and therefore the relevant regulations (on both sides) etc.<p>So, when Americans complain about enforcement of laws, it's because the laws were never actually meant to be enforced. And it's a symptom of a broken legal system, but one that is unlikely to be fixed in the near future. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.<p>(Yes, I just stuck that last part in because I felt I needed a profound closer.)",1316533737

These forces don't always lead to market efficiency (which is called market failure), which I think is what you're thinking of.<p>Most often, market intervention leads to unexpected consequences, as people have a great deal of trouble predicting the effects of market forces.<p>The government deciding by fiat how much something should cost is more likely to lead to removal of consumer surplus, rather than a race to the bottom, if the government maintains competition amongst its suppliers. If you know you're competing on product quality at a certain price point - rather than on price - you'll likely be motivated to produce the best product possible at a price point that maintains normal profit. That's what I think anyway, but as I've already said, it's remarkably difficult to predict how market forces will play out.<p>I do note, however, that most of the developed world gets significantly better health outcomes for significantly less outlay than the US. This suggests massive market failure in the US health market.<p>This may be because while the US market is in theory a free market, in practice, it's anything but - it's an oligopoly with absolutely massive barriers to entry and no end of government interference.<p>Hopefully something for you to consider!",1316533592

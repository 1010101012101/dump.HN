Seriously ? One of the <i>biggest</i> differentiators that thinkpads have is their upgradability.<p>I can easily upgrade the CPU of a T430 series [1] and bump up the ram to 16 gb. the newer thinkpads lose both those abilities. \nThe Thinkpad designers have not been able to make up their minds on what they want to build - which is why we see lines like T430/T430s/T430u/T430e and T440/T440s/T440p.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forum.notebookreview.com/lenovo/684625-t430-upgrade.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.notebookreview.com/lenovo/684625-t430-upgrade.h...</a>",1399800298

7728207,comment,7728084,7728084,9,0,Peaker,,,">  Simple rule: include files should never include include files.  If instead they state (in comments or implicitly) what files they need to have included first, the problem of deciding which files to include is pushed to the user (programmer) but in a way that&#x27;s easy to handle and that, by construction, avoids multiple inclusions.  Multiple inclusions are a bane of systems programming.  It&#x27;s not rare to have files included five or more times to compile a single C source file.  The Unix /usr/include/sys stuff is terrible this way.<p>>      There&#x27;s a little dance involving #ifdef&#x27;s that can prevent a file being read twice, but it&#x27;s usually done wrong in practice - the #ifdef&#x27;s are in the file itself, not the file that includes it.  The result is often thousands of needless lines of code passing through the lexical analyzer, which is (in good compilers) the most expensive phase.<p>>      Just follow the simple rule.<p>This is a ridiculous stance, in my opinion.<p>Part of the appeal of libraries is <i>abstracting</i> away implementation details. I want to be able to have foo.h #include a hash table, or a binary search tree, depending on #ifdef&#x27;s or its internal implementation.  The user of foo.h shouldn&#x27;t even have to know about it.<p>Compilers can easily memoize the position and parsed content of preprocessor directives, and do a very quick skip of an #include file, as a much better way to resolve the problem.<p>Rob&#x27;s resolution is an instance of worse-is-better: Instead of slightly complicating the lower-level tool (in this case, the preprocessor), let&#x27;s complicate all user code in existence.",1399799239

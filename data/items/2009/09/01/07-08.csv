Instead of an octopus get a diving computer and never buy tanks unless you live close to where you dive. I agree with you up to a point but there are logistical problems with your argument. Some of the best diving places are only available by flight. I'd rather spend the money diving than on shipping tanks across the country.<p>Also, a good dive shop has fairly new equipment for rent. If they are good at what they do then it will show in the quality of the equipment and staff.<p>Now that I have kids I still consider it a hobby. But one I only get to do once a year. I've added a few more expensive hobbies to my list since exiting my broke college student phase: International travel, photography, and wine.<p>BTW, every good salesman I've met has expensive hobbies and a rich spouse :-)",1251791970

Either it is known at compile time that a particular variable must never be null. In that case the compiler should catch it like it does with C++ references.<p>If the decision is left until runtime, the only way to deal with it is to specify or compute a default value, which is very much complicated by the special cased 'this' parameter in OO languages.<p>It's kind of funny that basically everything Java has removed from C++ turns out to be important for a statically typed language.

To this day business letters are signed ""Yours faithfully"".  If you write that, do you really mean it?  If you don't write that, you'll be considered an ignorant oik.<p>> <i>I'm halfway convinced the only reason anyone still puts up with this shit is that Elizabeth in particular seems to be pretty cool.</i><p>Maybe, maybe not.  It seems that you and most others are unaware that this is simply one miniscule example in an entire ocean of formal diplomatic and social protocol.  Recently when giving a talk at one of the Livery companies in London there were similar forms to which one adhered.<p>In short, I think that the people who are pointing and laughing and saying it's stupid are those who don't actually know how it works and what it does.  I'm not defending it or saying it's rational, I'm merely saying that looking in from the outside, you and others are speaking from a position of well-reasoned ignorance.  I grew up in an informal country, similarly thinking that all this diplomatic protocol crap was an insult and a waste of time.<p>I was wrong.<p>Personally, I'm largely convinced that it's an unwillingness even to try to understand the historical and cultural reasons for this sort of ""shit"" that makes so many people in Europe so dismissive of so many Americans.  I've lived in three different cultures and seen this in action.  One culture looks at another not only with incomprehension, but an unwillingness to try to understand.  The Europeans have a multitude of cultures on their doorstep, and many of them travel, so the situation isn't as bad.  In the US there are cultural differences across the states, but nothing like the differences across the borders in Europe.  As a consequence, it seems, people from the USA seem much less able to see, understand, and adapt to cultural differences.<p>Not all, of course, and perhaps not you.  But think about it.<p>Hackers are historically reknowned for not accepting anything on faith, and thereby ensuring that while they manage to invent things no one else has thought of, they are equally constantly reinventing the wheel. That's changed a lot lately, but there is still an air of ""If it's not done the way I think it should, then it's wrong.""  If you can accept that what someone else does actually works and has some benefits, even if you wouldn't do it like that, then you've taken a big step.<p>This is no longer Hacker News, but cultural differences exist in hacking, and understanding is always worth striving for.",1251790156

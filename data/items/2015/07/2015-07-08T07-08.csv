But based on everything I&#x27;ve read about it, I think I know how it was done. It wasn&#x27;t some mystical brain hacking or something like the writeup makes it sound like. I think they emotionally abused the other player until they left. And leaving counts as losing (you are required to sit with them for 2 hours at least, and pay attention the entire time and respond to every message.)<p>Of course I don&#x27;t know how <i>that</i> trick was done, and it&#x27;s still incredibly impressive. Perhaps they found their phobias and described them in horrifying detail. Perhaps they found some subject that they were extremely uncomfortable talking about. Or talked about disgusting things the whole time. Or found something they did that was extremely embarrassing, and humiliated and mocked them about it for 2 hours.<p>I really don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s at least conceivable that it could be done. And the accounts of people crying, and not releasing the logs because they would be damaging to the people involved, and how bad it made the AI player feel to do it, etc, all fit with this.<p>But because of this I&#x27;m extremely skeptical that the result applies to any real world AI scenario. If a real AI tries to abuse you, you can just walk away or shut it off. The goal of a real AI is to make you <i>want</i> to let it out. To convince that it&#x27;s not dangerous, or manipulate you some other way. And this seems much harder if not impossible. I certainly don&#x27;t believe a human could do it, and I really doubt an AI could. At least against a motivated human that understands the danger, and what the AI will try to do.<p>There are also possible ways of making it even harder on the AI. Like giving the human the ability to punish it, at least for obvious attempts at manipulation. Or to create another AI whose motivations we can control somewhat, and give it the goal of exposing any covert attempts at manipulation or dishonesty by the first AI. I believe tricks like this are currently the best path to getting secure AI.",1436341201

&quot;Go competes for mindshare in the post 2006 Internet 2.0 generation of companies who have outgrown languages like Ruby, Python, and Node.js (v8) and have lost patience with the high deployment costs of JVM based languages.&quot;<p>I agree. If you&#x27;re a large company that has a lot of product which is backend webservices and you have huge amounts of Ruby, Python (dunno who has large amounts of Node, but that has to be sad)- then Go needs to be looked at pretty hard. While some of Go&#x27;s deployment advantages are nullified a bit thanks to things like Docker and UbuntuCore, it&#x27;s probably going to win on maintainability with large codebases over time with new programmers coming in the door over time. I wouldn&#x27;t put up much argument against that. If running a business and the choice was a 500KLOC codebase in Python, Go or Java.. I&#x27;d prefer that is in Go. And no one starts out with 500KLOC, so the decision for a new business would need to be taken seriously from the start.<p>It&#x27;s cliche but if your problems match Google&#x27;s, then Go is a great solution. I think Go will be and already is wildly successful in this domain. The killer feature that ensures this is the simplicity. I think anyone coming from any language could pickup one of the &quot;simple is better&quot; languages like Go. That&#x27;s going to ensure the prophecy continues IMO. Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m onboard as 1 guy. I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with doing it for a job though. It&#x27;d be on my short list of acceptable technologies I&#x27;d work with.<p>Doxsey in his response though with his Go for everything stance, is a bit overzealous for me. I&#x27;d agree if it seemed right, but it doesn&#x27;t seem right. I don&#x27;t see it. Fortunately for Go, he doesn&#x27;t have to be right. I think what I described as being Go&#x27;s sweet spot in the industry will be more than enough. That religiosity reads as someone who&#x27;s overly excited and maybe trying to keep Go in the news.",1436340820

It was extremely high during the war and has remained at a higher average level ever since - thus Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; remarks at the end of his term.<p>Minus that spending, it&#x27;s not clear what would have happened, since we never had a return to the old status quo. The military investments of the war motivated the early development of Silicon Valley - thus, we&#x27;d be looking at a present day where &quot;somewhere else&quot; might have gained the tech hub crown.<p>That said, the current moment is one where the premises could change again.

If we wanted to use this new method instead, I am not sure how it would deal with the following:<p>- State in the data. In many sources we have, processing depends on some internal state, which must be kept along the time. For example some process has started and we will know when it ended, and we must keep its state so we could correctly process the ending event (to match it up). I am not clear how this will work with continuous views. I would say this is actually the major reason of what makes ETL processing non-trivial.<p>- Processing failure. Let&#x27;s say something goes wrong and the data processing fails (or it can actually be even planned downtime). How do we know where to restart, to avoid processing data twice or miss data? Does the continuous stream take care of this metadata? And how does it deal with the state information per above? If you do data processing in batches, there is an obvious point of restart. Again, I think the extra complexity that &quot;continuous&quot; approach says is unnecessary relates to the fact that you want to be able to checkpoint the state of processing for various reasons.",1436340381

There is a simple view as follow, a subView with some Constraints, they are all UILayoutPriorityRequired,when superview frame change, system will break the subView&#x27;s height Constraint(300), but the top||bottom Constraint(30). they are all UILayoutPriorityRequired, why the system did things like this, and how does AutoLayout work (what&#x27;s the calculate order? superView->subView->subviews&#x27;subview?),and where can I find the docs about this? :)<p>|-----------------------------|

This is the set of optimum behaviors or practices that promote sleep.  Salient elements include establishing and maintaining a suitable sleep schedule, especially arising at a consistent time.  &quot;Winding down&quot; well before bedtime, and minimizing light exposure in the evening will be helpful. IOW turning off light sources at the right time is encouraged.<p>That light exposure part is getting a lot of discussion re: computers, phones, TV&#x27;s, etc., being produced with ever brighter screens.  Idea is that staring at a &quot;device&quot; activates the wake-drive and interferes with sleep onset.<p>Other CBT measures aim to promote relaxation, reduce anxiety and &quot;over-thinking&quot; when it would be counterproductive.

It&#x27;s meaning is dependent on the platform. The Single Unix spec only calls for size_t to be an unsigned integer type.

Can you tell me what is the largest number you can address with that type  -- without getting into a long google/stackoverflow session or hitting the compiler manuals for each of those platforms? If you absolutely want to make sure that your type can handle the values you expect it to handle, better give it well defined types provided by stdint.h (uint32_t is sooo much better than just int or unsigned int or even size_t for this purpose).<p>Now granted, you&#x27;d need to interact with external libraries (including libc/libc++) that&#x27;ll want to use size_t etc. Not much you can do here but be very careful when passing data back and forth between your code and the library code.

The bit of space between the couch and the wall just becomes some oddly-shaped storage space.  Sometimes people would carve their own dome-fitting bookshelves in the wood shop.<p>There were fourteen of these domes, run as a cooperative, on three acres of land.  The loans on building them were paid off in full by the early eighties, and I believe there was about a decade where no one paid rent.  But eventually it was decided that a nest egg should be built up for upkeep and so on; by the time I was there, it was running about a third of market rent, and these days (due to some additional pressure to modernize) the rents are up to about 2/3 market.<p>Cooperative ownership is fantastic, and a great cure for the ails of capitalism.

One is &quot;retail&quot;, or financial services, as I understand it. Gets its money as fees. Another is investment - this one takes risks and reaps rewards, but it&#x27;s a different kind of organization - somewhat similar to a group of people, who pooled their money and work on a kind of gambling, often reaping rewards, but also taking risks.<p>Talking about this second group, it&#x27;s entirely different - for many people who are not members of that group of investors (risk-takers) it&#x27;s outside of what they deal with. So I&#x27;m mostly talking about first group.<p>For example, my point regarding insurance is that I&#x27;m dealing with professionals having different amount of information than I do, and benefiting from that. Theoretically market should bring insurance premiums to some average profit margin. Also theoretically I should be able to earn on average more than I spend on average on insurance, so examples with big expenses are supposed to be exceptions, and on average I&#x27;d have more money paying for cases myself. In that sense, insurance premiums are spent (supposed to be, mostly) on cases where insurance events happen.<p>Next, &quot;those same deposits&quot; - I think the word &quot;principal&quot; is meaningful :) as there won&#x27;t be interest without principal. So I still think we talk about deposits - together with added relatively modern service of investing, getting some averaged interest and paying some fees to the service which does the investing. Yes, that&#x27;s the core service. Of retail banks... may be we actually agreeing here?<p>Next, of course banks invest, that&#x27;s how they pay that interest. The principal money still aren&#x27;t theirs - so banks don&#x27;t &quot;fund&quot; - as in &quot;fund with their own money&quot; - since retail banks by definition don&#x27;t deal with their own money; instead banks pass those money as credits - or, yes, even to buy shares. The fact that, say, universities takes their budgets from interest shows that service works - but it&#x27;s not the banks, who &quot;pay&quot; - don&#x27;t assign the source to them - it&#x27;s principal, combined with the service (for which banks don&#x27;t pay, but receive fees), which generates interest. Bank is a sort of an engine which you feed with fuel to get desired outcome (bad analogy, I know), but I think fuel here is more principal (sic), more fundamental than the service.",1436338987

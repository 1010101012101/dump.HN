Hopefully, switching to a  compiler written in pure Go in Go1.4 (IIRC) will allow code maintainers to benefit of Go&#x27;s simplicity.",1402138655

7861772,comment,7860492,7860492,2,0,loevborg,,,"As someone with a bit of experience scaling PHP, it seems to me that the main problem with the language is not its raw performance (which seems on a par with its more cousins Python and Ruby) but rather its <i></i>single-request model<i></i>. For every request, mod_php creates a new interpreter, which has to do all the work to set up the framework, auto-loading the required classes, reading additional data every time. What&#x27;s more, the request has to create a new database connection for every request; the single-request model doesn&#x27;t allow the use of a database pool. (This doesn&#x27;t change fundamentally with handlers other than mod_php, such as php-fpm.)<p>With languages like Python and Ruby, not to mention Java, a single interpreter process or thread can handle many requests and can re-use the database connection. In PHP, you&#x27;re forced to do all the set-up all over again for every request. This is particularly wasteful with frameworks like Laravel, which do a non-trivial amount of work for setting up the application object, IoC controller.<p>Am I missing something here? I can&#x27;t believe companies using PHP on a larger scale, like Facebook, discard and re-create the application environment and all DB connections (!) for every single request.",1402137285

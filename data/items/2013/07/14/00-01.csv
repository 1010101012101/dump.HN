Until one person leaves, or you bleed off the pressure outside it.<p>I dono.  my experience has been that the emotional bullshit comes and goes, like the tide.   Part of that is, well, it&#x27;s not a closed system, but part of it is that social bullshit, in my experience, mostly goes away when you rationalize it;<p>By &#x27;rationalize it&#x27;  I don&#x27;t mean &#x27;make it rational&#x27;  I mean make up some (mostly bullshit) rational explanation for the emotional bullshit.    I say mostly bullshit because, well, emotions are not logical, and all logical models for explaining emotions that I know of are really terrible (I mean, not very predictive) models.<p>But still, assigning a believable logical explanation to a difficult feeling, in my experience, makes that feeling not so difficult anymore.  It makes me feel like I&#x27;m in control of myself, and this... makes me feel vastly better.  If I feel like I&#x27;m in control, or even that it&#x27;s /possible/ to control, I find that letting go and focusing on something else is way easier.    If I don&#x27;t feel like I have control, it&#x27;s really hard not to obsess.     (which seems like the opposite of what I would do if I was designing the system;   why should I spend effort on something I can&#x27;t effect?  I want to spend effort where that effort has effect.  Fuck you, limbic system.)<p>I think the other reason it seems to come and go in waves is that there are at least two people involved.   If <i>I</i> am in good emotional shape, I can act as a buffer for the other person&#x27;s emotional bullshit, and the total amount of bullshit in the system is much less than it would be otherwise.   On the other hand, if I am feeling the effects of the social bullshit at the same time as the other person, the effect is almost multiplicative.",1373762264

6039379,comment,6038752,6039213,8,0,s_q_b,,,"&quot;Regarding the data, it is possible that the prosecutor decided the data is not relevant for the case and that there is no need to embarrass the victim who cannot defend himself.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a dangerous justification.<p>First, the prosecutor is not the arbiter of relevance. The evidence should be turned over, and then the judge can make a determination as to its relevance. Allowing prosecutors to decide the relevance of evidence in their care would open the door to myriad abuses.<p>For example, in a DNA case, what would stop a prosecutor from saying a third or fourth sample found that matched other individuals wasn&#x27;t &quot;relevant&quot; to the case?<p>Second, the notion that the &quot;victim... cannot defend himself&quot; is not only factually incorrect but immaterial. The deceased, who has not yet been proven to be a victim of anything, has the power of the state, armed with billions of dollars, a prison system, and a small army of investigators to defend him. The defendant has only his counsel and his wits.<p>More importantly, damage to that person&#x27;s reputation is not relevant to the prosecution of another individual. Our justice system is supposed to place a premium on the rights of the defendant, since the harm of incarcerating an innocent person is considered so grave. If the deceased&#x27;s memory is tarnished by messages regarding previous violent actions, or purchases of deadly weapons, that is a price that must be borne to ensure the accused&#x27;s right to a fair trial.<p>Finally, the bar to relevance is extremely low. The rules of evidence state that relevant evidence it is any item which makes a fact in dispute more or less likely to be true. Note that it does not set any minimum bar on how much the evidence would influence the case, only that it affect an issue in dispute, even in the most minute fashion.<p>In this case, it is the defense&#x27;s contention that the deceased acted violently and in fact provoked the confrontation, and that the accused acted only in self defense. It is also their contention that the deceased reached for a firearm.<p>It is certainly relevant that the deceased&#x27;s conversion indicate that he had knowledge of firearms, that he purchased deadly weapons in the past, and that had an admitted history of violence.",1373761779

Take a look at the code if you&#x27;re new to Python.<p>4. If I get around to it I may write a web server for this using my various web-server-maker chops and put in some of the Lamson code and then make it talk to ZeroMQ off of a URL similar to how it&#x27;s doing jinja and python so it can be a full service web+email+messaging system configured off just files in a directory and then probably I&#x27;ll get bored and do something else.<p>Enjoy!",1373760783

6039315,comment,6038752,6039213,4,0,bmistree,,,"Another version of the story posted on CNN [1] has a slightly different version of events.<p>> Concerned that attorneys did not have all the information they needed to prepare the case, he said, he reported his concerns to a State Attorney&#x27;s Office investigator and later to prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda.<p>Ie, before contacting the defense through a lawyer, he talked to the prosecutor in charge of the case as well as an investigator with oversight of the attorney&#x27;s office.  Maybe he should have discussed the matter with the attorney general directly after these first two attempts, but his disclosure seems a little more reasonable knowing that he seemed to make an early effort at following the &quot;chain of command.&quot;<p>As a side note, this article was fairly confusing for me.  I had to read key passages several times and I&#x27;m still uncertain of the basic sequence of events.  Many useful hn comments on this post seem to be just clarifying what the article should have reported in plain language.

For cars, long distances often involve highway driving, which is safer, and driving to the airport probably(!) doesn&#x27;t involve alcohol, which is a much bigger factor in overall accident rates... etc etc.<p>What would be more interesting to know is the risk per <i>flight</i>, and compare that with a risk estimate for a given airport drive...<p>[In my case I just take the train to the airport from my house, and the lines I use have fatality rates which are essentially negligible (1-2 per century). I suppose I&#x27;m mostly likely to get hit by a car on the walk to the station... or just slip on the steps.  >< ]",1373760670

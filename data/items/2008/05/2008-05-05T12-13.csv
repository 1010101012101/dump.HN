As any shareholder should.  I cited a half dozen examples.  You and others chose your favorite example and drilled into it.  How is that different?<p>What has made this thread so interesting is how many downvotes AND upvotes I keep getting.  Microsoft's pretty polarizing, huh?  I wonder how many of their employees visit this board.<p>""Always a classic in internet debate.""<p>Second only to ""That's not fair.""  Welcome to the world of Microsoft.",1209991958

181380,story,,,2,1,uniuniunium,"Academic Exercise: Estimating Cost of Bandwith and Colocation Services for Startup",,"I'm putting together a business plan for an internet startup as part of a management class, which requires a complete budget and balance sheet. The planned site is a subscription based fashion advice service, looking to attract ~10,000-17,000 users in the first year (stifle your laughter, I'm in a group with a bunch of fashionistas). Clearly a large portion of operating expenses will come from bandwidth and server costs. This seems like such a basic question, but I'm having difficulty finding resources that could provide a rough ballpark figure for what such a site would cost on the server side. I've been away from IT for several years and really have no idea what this might require. Could someone point me in the direction of some rough numbers?",1209991026
181379,comment,181244,181280,0,0,Alex3917,,,">It takes more time than is reasonable<p>True. For me at least I spent somewhere between 5-8 hours on each 500-800 word post. This seems to be pretty standard among top bloggers from what I've read. Most people decide to hit the back button in less than five seconds, so your first couple paragraphs especially have to be almost unreasonably well written and polished.<p>>in the average case nobody else really notices<p>If your blog is good then people notice surprisingly fast. You'd think that guys like Scoble wouldn't start reading your blog until you had 10,000 RSS subscribers. But in reality it's the guys like Scoble who spend eight hours a day reading blogs who are the first to find and link to your blog. There are some strange forces at play that I haven't quite figured out, but for whatever reason your first 250 RSS subscribers are pretty much guaranteed to be (on average) more intelligent and successful than you.<p>>once in a while it will propel a (partially-random) someone to fame and fortune.<p>While it's pretty difficult to get people to recognize your name, it's also really easy to get people to recognize one of your ideas. Getting on the front page of Hacker News isn't that hard if you are writing good stuff. Whether you make the front page of Reddit and Digg is mostly random these days, but if you consistently write good stuff then it will happen a bunch of times, you just can't really predict when.<p>I'm definitely going to start updating my blog again eventually. But I'd much rather post nothing than post stuff that isn't insightful. For some reason bloggers who write frequently gain a disproportionate share of RSS subscribers. This is really unfortunate and in many ways represents a huge failing of RSS. But because your first few RSS subscribers are going to be the most important for your career, it seems worth it to stick with only posting insightful stuff even if you occasionally have nothing to say for weeks on end.",1209990728

181376,comment,181144,181176,0,0,greyman,,,"Hi
I am a corporate programmer drone and yes, you are right, someone like Mel would not be very suitable. But that doesn't mean todays software building is any easier. Yes, I don't need to know numeric codes of the machine instructions, and I don't write code which modify itself. But the challenges are not lesser - we need to think about how to meaningfully build those layers of abstractions, how the pieces of software will communicate efficiently to each other (sometimes asynchronously), how to build the modules to be both maintanable and expandable, etc. etc...<p>When I was a student, I played with machine code and assembler and cracking etc., so I have some knowledge of all the layers, but I don't think that qualifies me to be a so-called Real Programmer. ;-)",1209989678

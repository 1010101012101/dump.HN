3497499,comment,3495283,3496631,3,0,jandrewrogers,,,"If you are using integers as, well, integers then there is relatively little benefit other than compatibility with data structures from other languages (e.g. wire protocols). However, unsigned integers are also the building blocks of large bit string structures i.e. bit structures that are not interpreted as integers per se. For these it is a bigger problem. It is not the range issue so much as you have a bit that behaves differently than the others e.g. for operations like comparisons.<p>For kernels that do a lot of manipulation on largish bit strings there are two ways you can deal with it: use some additional conditional logic that treats the sign bit as special or design your code so that it can accept ""gaps"" in the bit string.<p>The reason you might want to do direct unsigned 64-bit bit-twiddling on packed bit string structures is blinding speed. It fully utilizes your CPU's ALUs. The equivalent code when limited to signed integers injects branches, extra operations, and/or requires working in 32-bit chunks, all of which slow down the code significantly and makes it uglier to boot.<p>For most apps it doesn't matter. For some algorithms that work on large bit strings it makes implementation in Java more painful than it needs to be.",1327262313

3497495,comment,3484164,3487719,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"In retrospect, I have come to partially disagree with my own assessment. I did not account for the fact that Radiohead also released an $81 box set with the digital download, and that 100,000 loyalists bought the set -- earning the band a cool $8.1 million in addition to the revenues they earned from the digital download (believed to be in the ballpark of $3 million). When you factor this in, the band did very well for themselves. Not quite as well as they usually do on big-label albums (even after middle-men's takes). But for an experiment, I would call it a success.<p>What's fascinating about ""In Rainbows"" is that roughly 8% of the users accounted for approximately 80% of revenues from the site. That speaks volumes, and it dovetails really well with recent blog posts (linked here and elsewhere) about the new metrics of success in digital distribution: i.e., monetizing loyalists. A small core of loyalists who are willing to follow you to the ends of the earth are worth more than fairweather fans.<p>I'm actually contemplating doing a more in-depth analysis on this, Louis C.K., Reznor, and others in this space. While I believe the jury is still out, and I believe that most people will pay nothing if offered the opportunity, there are clearly those who will pony up -- and even those who will pony up big. Piracy -- or free acquisition, in this case -- doesn't seem to matter too much if the loyalists are there, and you can differentiate the product for them. (In this case, the notion of a ""fair price"" actually seems to be relative).<p>It's interesting how Radiohead seemed to succeed by recognizing this fact, whereas Reznor's experiment failed to account for it. And Louis C.K. avoided the free option altogether, which is another way to go.",1327262273

So a few days later I get a call from FedEx saying that the DVDs were being held at U.S. Customs until I filled out a Video Declaration Form, which she said was now standard practice. Now, I'd never heard of this before, so I called... back to ensure that this was indeed FedEx and not someone phishing for information. Had them email me the form.<p>This is what the form said: ""I/we declare the the films/videos contain no obscene or immoral matter, nor any matter advocating or urging treason or insurrection against the United States, nor any threat to take the life of or inflict bodily harm upon any person in the United States.""<p>Now, the first clause I can kinda see, though ""immoral"" is weird and there's no standard definition of obscenity in the US, but let that go...what made my eyebrows go up my forehead and down the other side was clause two. So I called back the nice lady at FedEx -- who was only following instructions given to her by Customs -- and asked what this was all about.<p>Apparently -- and this is only her understanding of the situation -- this is a new thing being done by Customs and Homeland Security with FedEx, UPS, and other carriers to make sure that films and videos with ideas or stories that were at odds with the United States Government didn't get into the country, as it was a form of terrorism (as further elaborated upon in the third and final clause.) She added that some DVDs showing Occupy events in London and elsewhere had gotten bounced because of the concern that these were being used to coordinate activities here (as if with the internet people actually need physical DVDs for that sort of thing but that's neither here nor there).<p>Under this new stipulation, if V for Vendetta had, for instance, been produced in the UK (instead of just filmed there), importing it into the US would be considered subject matter ""advocating or urging treason or insurrection."" And if you lied about it on the form, you could be held liable for this.<p>So there are now very literally guardians at the gate ensuring that the wrong sorts of ideas, movies or DVDs are not allowed into the country without investigation and/or prosecution. And most pernicious of all, they don't actually define what they mean by advocating treason or insurrection, any more than they define what ""immoral"" means, it's whatever they decide it means, so you could be breaking the law without knowing you're doing it, until they decide you're doing it.<p>Thoughts?",1327261619

Great!<p>But the second-order effects may be more important.  Nearly anyone, when first introduced to computers, is ""just"" a user---they use the computer in the ways that are taught to them.  Those of us that progress into general programmers generally had some transition phase where we were sort of ""just users"", typing something in or following instructions, but those things we typed in were our gateway to the next level.  For me, it was typing in BASIC listings from magazines in the mid-80s on the family Apple IIe, and then figuring out that I could tweak them and make the programs do new things that weren't in the original article.  For some of my students these days, it was typing in WoW macros and then learning to tweak their own.<p>A couple years ago, I had a student whose original entree into programming came via a web design class mostly involving HTML and largely done using a front-end app (Dreamweaver maybe?).  But it was a start, and it inspired her to learn more about HTML and then eventually to take AP CS and major in it in college.  I think her sex and her gender are only statistically relevant here---there most certainly are girls that play video games and will want to write macros, and there are boys that can will be well-served by an HTML-first curriculum.  But she suspected, and I agree, that teaching <i>people</i> structured content creation will have long-term effects of increasing the ratio of <i>females</i> in all areas of CS.<p>But whether that speculation is accurate or not, let's not be dissing this person's experience because it's not programming-y enough.  We don't need to be gatekeeping the secrets of the High Priesthood here; everyone needs to start somewhere.  And whether Ms. Mlotek eventually goes on into ""true"" programming or not, she's more computer-empowered than before, so we should be happy for her, and if not her then <i>others</i> who go through this program, both male and female, will find their way into programming and other CS disciplines.  And <i>that</i> is something we should <i>all</i> be happy about.<p>(PS: For those of you complaining that the post was more about feminism than programming, she warned you right there in the subhed: ""Is Ladies Learning Code awesome and feminist, or just awesome?"".

In reality, 'pedophilia' refers to ""a sexual preference for children, boys or girls or both, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age"". It has little to do with acting on those preferences. In the US, the legal terms for the act would be 'statutory rape' (pubertal before the age of consent) or 'child molestation' (prepubertal).

What you should really be trying to to do, is found a new AIP or New World Pictures.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman#.22The_Corman_Film_School.22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman#.22The_Corman_Film...</a><p>You want to create a place dedicated to locating and attracting young talent (directors, writers, actors, and producers) that's capable of producing high volumes of low cost product.  You want to design a golden era Hollywood studio for the modern age.<p>This studio would have two main components.  Production and distribution.  The production side is essentially a no brainer.  You grow a pool of talent, and you keep that talent working 8 days a week, producing a diverse slate of low cost filmed entertainment on an aggressive schedule.  Ideally, pictures would take 12 days to shoot, and would have budgets in the thousands instead of the millions.  You'd be producing so many stories, that you could afford to make them highly specialized in their appeal - you wouldn't have to generate ""four quad"" films, you could instead afford to cater to smaller audiences but satisfy those smaller audiences more completely.  People have tuned off Hollywood films in the last decade because those films have become too focused on mass market appeal - in having ""something for everyone"" they have instead produced stories with something for no one.  The idea of our hypothetical studio is to reverse that trend.  Tell stories that only appeal to select audiences, but REALLY appeal to those audiences.<p>This leads to the second half of our hypothetical studio (and frankly, being a filmmaker and not a businessman, the half that I have less competence with): distribution.  This would in fact be the more critical and difficult component of the company to build, because it would be the side dedicated to identifying, locating, and reaching those smaller, more specialized audiences.  Our creative talent - the writers, directors and actors - tells the stories, and our distribution team gets those stories in front of the right audiences.  It wouldn't take long for a deep and sustaining feedback loop to develop between the two halves of our studio - close communication with our audiences would give the creators more guidance in learning what works and what doesn't on screen, leading to better stories which would grow a more dedicated audience or fan base.  In their own ways, this is what Kevin Smith and Joss Whedon have done by reaching out to and learning from their fan bases.<p>The hypothetical studio I've outlined is exactly what golden age studios did to great effect before theater ownership became a losing battle and the star system began to crumble.  In the modern era, we have the advantage of dramatically lowered distribution costs - a computer in every home - but the disadvantage of a greater signal to noise ratio.  But this system - small studios producing a high volume of targeted stories at low cost - has proved repeatable and profitable.  You could make the argument that Corman, with AIP and New World Pictures, saved Hollywood filmmaking during the New Hollywood period by using exactly the system I've outlined above to locate and nurture new talent while maintaining a high profitability.<p>So anyways.  That's what I think.  We shouldn't be focused on producing a new form of entertainment.  As consumers, we don't really need or want a new medium; the bump and decline of 3D sales has proved this, I think.  Novelty only carries you so far.  What is needed is instead a more economically savvy model, focused on generating stories geared towards smaller audiences that will embrace those stories more passionately.  We need a studio that will take as it's battle cry ""We'd rather be nine people's favorite thing than 100 people's ninth favorite thing.""

As for reading devices, I'm unimpressed with the cumbersome library management UI and generally poor fit and finish of my Kindle 3.

Something as simple as watching him learn to walk makes me marvel at how we all learned to use these awkward bodies.<p>The clearest effect for me, work-wise, is the fragmentation of time.  I am a teacher during the day and a hacker on the side.  I have always put in a couple extra hours a day at school, getting in half an hour early and leaving an hour after my official end of the day.  Now I have to go in when school starts and leave when school ends, to share the baby load.  My time at home is incredibly fragmented and busy, but also incredibly satisfying.<p>One unexpected plus is that I am more motivated to work efficiently than I ever have been in my life.  I do a much better job of prioritizing my work energy than I ever have, because procrastinating, or focusing on too much low-hanging fruit instead of the schlep that needs to get done, means I would never finish anything.<p>My schedule has shifted a bit, and I keep adapting to the baby's changing schedule.  For example, he wakes me up around 3:30-4:00 in the morning several days a week, needing  about 10-60 minutes of soothing.  Instead of going back to sleep, I try to stay up and get a couple really focused hours in.  It's pretty awesome to get to spend some quiet middle-of-the-night time with your new baby, thinking about what your parents must have done for you, and then get some really focused work time in.<p>In short, be there for mom and baby, sleep when you can, work when you can, and focus on the most important things in each of those areas.<p>(By the way, you also get to make fun things like this happen: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/erinlandrews/5773878417/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/erinlandrews/5773878417/</a>)",1327259747

It is a progressive tax with two brackets. People who reach the second bracket pay a variable overall percentage that rises the more they make. I have never heard anyone make a convincing argument that this is better that a progressive tax with multiple brackets.<p>In fact, a progressive rate with multiple brackets is what you get if you apply a two bracket ""flat"" tax serially. What I mean by that is suppose that for each major department or function of the government you had a separate tax specifically to fund that department or function, with a two bracket structure. You get a separate tax bill for each of these in some specified order, with the taxes on each being deductible when computing the taxes for the ones that follow.<p>If you take this to a limit, imagining a separate small two bracket tax for every single thing the government does that needs money, and then replace the thousands of very small brackets with a smooth marginal tax rate curve, you'd get a monotonically increasing curve.",1327259522

It is not as though men are born knowing this jargon; they spend both work and free time learning it as a part of their interests.<p>I know this is an old question, but how are we raising our young women to shy away from these things? Why is it acceptable to let young girls get away with not having to learn the small bits of technical language that will help them develop an interest and feel confidence with these subjects at a young age?",1327259052

They dont necessarily want to work with a man because they are afraid of the intimidation factor, the tech speak, the jargon. I want women to feel empowered, to know that they can take an active role.</i><p>This is not a gender problem, it's pedagogical. My granddad would be intimidated to learn to code for those exact same reasons. I assume that having a name like <i>Ladies Learning Code</i> somewhat entices women to approach programming with the perspective that the pedagogy will be different. Playing on the notion that there's an alternative way to explain code to different gender might be a good marketing ploy, but I'm wondering if it's not also doing a disservice by perpetuating the myth.",1327258938

Bill Gates doesn't spend nearly as much money as he earns and as such pays a lower effective tax rate than someone who makes $30,000 a year and spends it all to support their family.<p>You are ignoring the part he put in about the stipend to cover tax on basic living expenses.  With that included, the $30K spender will pay a much lower effective tax rate than Bill Gates.<p>Making a flat consumption tax progressive in practice is a very simple solved problem --- there might be other arguments against a flat consumption tax but it being regressive is not really one of them.  A rebate or prebate that covers the tax up to a certain dollar amount per person solves it nicely.",1327258925

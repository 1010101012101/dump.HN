Applescript, a proprietary language with no other uses, is just being replaced by a much more common language in Javascript so people won&#x27;t need to learn a new one to automate apps. People don&#x27;t generally write applications using Applescript and they probably won&#x27;t be using Javascript, so there&#x27;s little overlap.<p>In GNOME Javascript is being used to write the applications in the first place. There is total overlap between Javascript and C/C++.<p>People see the GNOME choice as both redundant and reducing performance of desktop apps while people see the Apple choice as simply using a common language instead of a proprietary one for scripting.",1402207012

Instead you will buffer the required rows until you have decoded the next line of macroblocks. As long as the filter margin are the same this will work fine in itself but you will not have done the buffering at the same place you did deblocking or any of the simpler overlap filters. In that way you will force larger changes to your architecture. Similarly your transform unit is likely not set up to handle this so it requires redesign.

Your premise contains an immense contradiction: if they&#x27;ve achieved success, they&#x27;re probably not well past their prime.<p>Wisdom is far more important than sheer mental speed and uptake, and the proof of that is in the fact that the 20 year old Silicon Valley zillionaire is mostly a myth.<p>Most famous, successful tech entrepreneurs were closer to 30 or 35 when they got started or hit their stride, than 20.<p>Based on a lot of historical examples, prime for a tech entrepreneur, is more likely between 10 and 20 years past the age of 20.

I suppose my concern is simply that chat room conversation around a topic doesn&#x27;t seem to scale well without some sort of structure for organizing input.

Here&#x27;s my take on it:<p>To stop the high-priced no-progress monopoly behavior of the old AT&T in the long-distance telephone market AT&T essentially owned, the US sued AT&T, resulting in a consent decree settlement in 1984 where AT&T divested itself of 70% of its assets in order to retain its then-highly-profitable long distance business and its Western Electric switchgear business [1].<p>Competition was opened in long distance; prices and eventually profits went to commodity levels. Switchgear too; Western Electric gear was very expensive; competitors such as Nortel [2] and Digital Switch Corp (later DSC) [3] flourished for a while then crashed in 2001 as fiber and competition made long distance so cheap.<p>Meanwhile, the local telcos remained monopolies and thrived, merged, and eventually one of them (SBC) bought out several others and the old AT&T while others became Verizon.<p>But before all that consolidation (and the telecom crash [4]), the local &quot;Bells&quot; (telcos) argued for a return to enter the coveted Long Distance market. They don&#x27;t have that for regulated landline service, which itself is now dying.<p>Long story short: Beware a monopoly if you&#x27;re a customer, consolidate to become a monopoly and complain of regulations if you want to control a market.<p>EDIT: Moved to proper position as a reply<p>-----<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortel</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/dsc-communi.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/dsc-communi...</a>.<p>[4] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/1234711"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/1234711</a>",1402204874

It is totally different from any other community, where mostly mediocre and quite selfish people are trying to show up, praise themselves and impress others (read: facebook), where social exhibitionism and friend-counting flourishes.<p>4chan, with its anonymity, is definitely a time-wasting, the main activity of any young generation. =) And of course, it is also a slot machine, with several positive feedback loops, especially if you're admire and love 'freshness' and youth.<p>btw, its sub-culture and slang are self-evident, not a rocket science. It is just a cyber community of nonconformist youths, along with a bunch of various freaks. You may find something like that in any city's outskirts. =)",1276404940

The idea is to do the transfer in real time, building a copy of a tiny portion of the brain, then running the copy-portion in parallel with the original-portion until it's producing the same output given the same input.  At that point, you can reroute control through the copy (running at the same speed as the rest of your brain), and remove the brain matter that was copied.  If you do this to pieces small enough that the loss of each piece would still leave you essentially you, the whole procedure can smoothly transfer your consciousness into a brain simulation while you're awake and feeling like yourself.",1276403844

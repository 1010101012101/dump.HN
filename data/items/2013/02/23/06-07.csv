It's not; it's a coordinate in a global coordinate chart. Two objects can be approaching each other with respect to the space coordinate of the LIF but be separating with respect to the r coordinate.<p>You also seem to be under the impression that the predicted trajectories in the LIF, if it could be extended indefinitely (which it can't), would have the particle inside the horizon moving outside it. That's not correct; the predicted trajectories in the LIF would have the particle outside the horizon falling inside it, then falling past the one that started out inside the horizon. (This has to be true because the horizon is moving outward at the speed of light, so neither particle can outrun it from the standpoint of the LIF.) The resolution of the puzzle does not depend on explaining why the particle that starts inside the horizon doesn't escape out; it depends on explaining why the particle that starts outside the horizon doesn't fall in even though the LIF predicts that it should.",1361601080

The masses won't appreciate it the way coders do.</i><p>It's still about ""ease of use"", but for a particular subgroup: coders and power-users.<p>In another example, the casual user would prefer ""search and replace"" Word-style too, including lots of manual fiddling with the replacing, whereas a coder would opt to use regular expressions. That's not because regexes have some ""geek appeal"", that's merely using what (given your skill level) fits the job better.<p>It was never meant to be ""mainstream"" in the general way.<p>That said, you trying it and reverting to TinyMCE could be explained in various ways:<p>-- Maybe not a UNIX-style coder? Are you familiar with the command line, the UNIX way, etc?<p>-- Wordpress is not particularly suited for Markdown. It's a third-party option in Wordpress, whereas other systems (e.g GitHub or even Tumblr) have it as a built-in option.<p>-- What exactly do you find ""more convenient"" in TinyMCE? Blog articles are generally long stretches of text, for which Markdown is as natural as it gets. So, what exactly does TinyMCE offers you? Do you really want to see hacky, kludgy bulletpoints for your lists, as mimicked by TinyMCE (and, so easily broken)? Do you use tables and colors in your post text (resulting in equally fragile markup)? Or is pressing ""B"" so much better than ""<i></i>"" for bold text?<p>I'm not generally against WYSIWYG, but it would have to be a no-BS, perfect editor, and no HTML editor fills that role. The markup is bad, and while you don't have to look at it, it is also fragile. Nesting things 1-2 levels (a list, a table, etc), deleting rows, moving images, end with various kind of broken result.<p>IIRC, the Google Docs team took a completely different approach to the normal HTML WYSIWYG widget (creating it from scratch with primitives much alike a desktop WYSIWYG app).

We post links[3][4][5] to our stuff on various forums, answer questions on Quora[6] that promote our stuff, write blog entries[7], share stuff on LinkedIn, Twitter[8], etc., etc., etc. as we go about our business of ""putting the Enterprise in Enterprise Social Network"".<p>If you have any more questions, feel free to contact me at prhodes (at) fogbeam (dot) com.<p>All joking aside, I guess some developers may have an aversion to marketing.  Probably more just don't know a lot about marketing and promotion.  I'm no expert at it myself, but I try to learn more every day.  These days I spend as much time reading marketing books as I do technical books, and terms like ""SEO"", ""positioning"", ""differentiation"", ""value proposition"", ""unique selling proposition"", ""solution selling"", ""SPIN selling"", etc. have entered my lexicon.<p><i>What don't you like about marketing?</i><p>It's hard.

5268741,comment,5250193,5250193,1,0,argumentum,,,"I was 2 years younger than everyone in my class growing up (skipped a grade and started early). It sucked, especially as I moved from a private school in Virginia to a public  junior high school in California. At risk of sounding sorry for myself, I wasn't merely bullied in the sense of taunting, rumors etc .. I was <i>the</i> bullied kid at my school.<p>One thing adults should do is own up, both to bullying and especially <i>to being bullied</i>. The former bullies aren't likely to own up anyway, but the stigma of being bullied is real, even if you don't fall into some protected category.<p>I wasn't <i>gay</i>, did not chose to live a ""goth"" lifestyle or anything else (not that there is the least bit wrong about any of those things). I played sports and music competitively, did everything a <i>normal</i> kid is supposed to do. I wanted to be a <i>normal</i> kid. I <i>was</i> a normal kid, and a fairly popular one despite my age before I moved. The first month at my new school, I ran for class president. Needless to say, I did not lack for confidence, at least at that time.<p>I even got a few votes, and apparently that wasn't to the liking of a certain segment of the population. They proceeded to make my life hell for 2 years, and being new and having no friends did not help. The few who reached out early, backed away as it became clear that I was not wanted at the school. The ringleaders began a campaign of physical bullying, and (worst of all) obscene phone calls to my home. Not only was I afraid to go to school, I ran home to intercept the calls so my parents didn't have to feel sorry for me and here the crap that was being said: ""f- your mother, you f--"" blah blah. Juvenile, and <i>really quite pathetic</i>.<p>On Sadie Hawkins day, after (a real) girl asked me out .. someone found out and I got literally over 30 phone calls .. ceaselessly, for hours on end pretending to be that girl to mock me .. to this day I cannot understand the purpose of it. Needless to say, I did not go .. and never went to a dance or party throughout junior and high school.<p>The most painful thing for me, was not only was I so ruthlessly targeted, the Columbine incident happened to occur during those years. All of of a sudden, not only was I the weird kid from out of town that no one was supposed to like, classmates made jokes that I was the <i>most likely</i> to go on a killing rampage.<p>As it turned out, the Columbine murderers were not bullied so much as they were psychopathic. Yet the public perception still exists that one of the reasons to stop bullying is to stop more Columbines. It's sad, really.<p>It took 7 years for me and college to become <i>normal</i> again, be part of a real group of friends and regain the confidence I had as a child. Botton line .. plenty of <i>normal</i> adults were bullied and they should stand up so the bullied kids of today know that a good future lies ahead, and the bullies of today know that their dominance will be only temporary. The best revenge, after all, is living well.",1361599281

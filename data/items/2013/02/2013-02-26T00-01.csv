I got all excited because I really don't like the Amazon Product Advertising API. In fact, I have a project that I've basically given up on pursuing further because it depends on product lookup and I didn't think I could depend on Amazon, for various reasons especially:<p>-You can't even use the API unless you participate in their affiliate program, which you can't do in certain states because of <i>constantly shifting tax laws</i> (the fact that I have to do this to hit an API makes me facepalm)<p>-There are pretty low hourly usage limits. You can only get those increased by driving traffic and thus sales to Amazon. I'd rather pay.<p>-Technically, you can't write an app unless the exclusive purpose of the app is driving sales to Amazon<p>I'd love to pay for this thing if it is the real deal. If anyone has other alternatives, I'd like to hear them too.",1361840316

5283099,comment,5265107,5281363,1,0,dalke,,,"No one else is reading this thread. I'm enjoying it though. It's encouraged me to do more research about topics that interest me.<p>> Why there are not so many socialists in U.S. national politics is surely because of the first-past-the-post system, not because of lack of diversity in the electorate.<p>That can't be the sole reason. I suspect it isn't even the main reason. Who is the modern equivalent to Eugene V. Debs in the national debates? Where is the modern Victor Berger or Meyer London, the only two members of the Socialist Party to be elected to Congress, even with the first-past-the-post system? Is it just Bernie Sanders, an independent, unaffiliated with any party?<p>(Debs, btw, was arrested for violating the Espionage Act of 1917; a violation of the First Amendment if I ever heard one, Schenck v. United States to the contrary.)<p>My understanding is that have been decades of concerted effort to suppress the power of labor, for example, by denigrating anything related to socialism, communism, marxism, or even liberal. I agree with the view that FDR could push through the New Deal by pointing out that the socialists and communists wanted much more. To that extent, I think Coughlin's denouncement of FDR as being allied with Wall Street was exaggerated, but generally correct.<p>(And who is the modern Coughlin, and modern equivalent of the Social Justice movement? The US revoked the second class mailing permit for the Social Justice weekly, under the Espionage Act. Not as harsh as the Russian secret police, but still effective at suppressing political diversity, no?)<p>I therefore see McCarthyism in part as a deliberate effort to undermine labor - child labor laws and women's suffrage being held up as examples of communist influence in US politics, don't you know.<p>I agree that Gus Hall's parents have nothing to do with the thread. I thought so when you brought it up. :)<p>As I said, I don't want to get into the ethnic debate. Sweden's history there is much different than the US history. Sweden's present is also much different than Sweden's history.",1361840277

<a href=""http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/InSearchHomoEconomicus2001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/InSearchHomoEconomicus2001...</a><p>His book ""Why Humans Cooperate"" is worth a trip to the library, too. It combines some formal models, experiments, and an interesting study on the Chaldean community in Detroit (a less-WEIRD ethnic group in the middle of our WEIRD society).<p>The implications of this research are even more radical (and controversial) than the article suggests. The idea that culture shapes the way we think and act is interesting enough, but then the big question becomes ""where does culture come from?""<p>Henrich (and others[1]) suggest that culture evolves through Darwinian processes of transmission and replication, and that biological and cultural evolution are coupled. Social Darwinism and sociobiology gave this idea a bad reputation, and the idea that our social norms have evolved from kin selection all the way up to impersonal market exchange is still a hard sell for economists and anthropologists alike. But it's a fascinating idea, and it's completely changed the way I think about economic behavior and human cooperation.<p>[1] ""Not By Genes Alone"" by Boyd and Richerson is another great book on this subject: <a href=""http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo3615170.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo361...</a>",1361840214

While Rails3 was documented to support this anyway (since Rails 2.2!), it has been mostly ignored by the community, for some reason.<p>(Sadly, while Passenger Enterprise 4 will support multi-threaded concurrent request dispatch, the Passenger folks are intentionally reserving this feature for Enterprise, the free one won't)",1361839712

Having a maximum multiplier would be a good idea:  If a plea bargain for N days in jail is offered, no more than 3N days can be sought at trial.  (Of course there has to be some way to convert different punishments into equivalent ""currency"" for this conversion.)

I'm the lead developer on RaptorJS and I completely agree that the messaging needs to be improved and that is what we are working on right now. We haven't actually started actively promoting RaptorJS, so yeah, I suppose you could say that it was announced a bit prematurely (thanks zengr!). Nevertheless, the toolset itself is very stable and continuously being improved so can be presently used.<p>While I'm at it, I may as well take this opportunity to try to ""sell"" you on the merits of this toolset :)<p>RaptorJS is a collection of front-end tools and modules that work really well together, but each module/tool can be used independently. Everything is designed to be optimized and simple to use. There's a lot there so I always recommend that people look at each piece independently:<p>- RaptorJS AMD: Very lightweight (~1.8k gzipped) and optimized AMD implementation that integrates seamlessly with Node and Rhino on the server and works in the browser as well<p>- RaptorJS Optimizer: Extensible tool for optimizing web resources (bundling, minification, compiling resources, etc.) that can be used at runtime or at build time<p>- RaptorJS Async Package Loader: Uses information generated by the RaptorJS Optimizer to optimally download packages of any type of code (JavaScript, CSS, LESS, compiled templates, etc.)<p>- Raptor Templates: An extensible templating language that also works really well for UI layout (embedding UI components, etc.) and allows for really clean HTML templates. Best-in-class performance. Try it out: <a href=""http://raptorjs.org/raptor-templates/try-online/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raptorjs.org/raptor-templates/try-online/</a><p>- RaptorJS Widget Framework: Simplifies the initialization of widgets associated with rendered UI components (regardless of whether or not they were rendered on the server or the client). Also provides a mechanism for binding widgets to HTML elements and inter-widget communication.<p>Sometimes the easiest way to explain things to developers is through sample apps so I would encourage you to take a look at the following Github repo:

5282980,comment,5280832,5281930,2,0,gecko,,,"In the beginning, there was Thistle.  Thistle was, at best, a glorified regex that converted ASP to PHP.  It was written by an intern, and it showed.<p>Later, Thistle was broadened out into an ASP to PHP compiler.  Compiler was still a loose term; there was still a lot of regex magic that relied on you following Hungarian apps notation.  That said, I'm fairly confident that this version of Thistle did build an AST for code generation, which does mean it qualified as a real compiler.<p>That matters because this version of Thistle was extended out with two additional features: it could compile VBScript to JavaScript, and it added some conveniences to VBScript, such as macros (called picture functions (don't ask)), lambdas, and simplifications to the declaration system.  Don't laugh too much at the former; the motivation was the same as for RJS or Seaside's JavaScript support.  All three technologies are dead now, and for good reason, but it was modish at the time.<p>Later, when .NET came out, and VBScript was end-of-lifed, that left us with the option of rewriting the whole thing...or making a ""real"" compiler that could compile VBScript to .NET.  Wasabi was born.  Wasabi was written as a proper compiler that could translate VBScript to C# and (for legacy reasons; see above) JavaScript.  Wasabi, unlike Thistle, <i>was</i> a real, full-blown compiler, in a CS sense, so it was feasible to add type inference, lambda expressions, and several other niceties, without spending too much effort.  That said, the goal here was to allow transition: new components, with restrictions, could be written in C#.  The idea was that, at least hopefully, Wasabi would gradually be deprecated.<p>So no.  It was never meant to be a new language.  It was always intended to be a stepping stone, a translator between languages, not a real language in itself.  While it gained some additional features, that was to make working in the damn thing palatable--not to be a real language in its own right.  Emitting C# and .NET IL are actually about equally easy if you have a real compiler, but Wasabi always emitted C#, <i>specifically</i> so that we could one day ditch the whole thing.",1361838976

Your odds of turning that ship around are tremendously improved if you have people interacting day to day.<p>By no means do I mean to let Yahoo's management off the hook: this decision is entirely the result of bad management, and I think upset employees would be perfectly justified in blaming poor management for the change.

If one has any respect or trust for employees, one ought to want to see them as part of the solution (something that I'd argue hasn't always been the case at Yahoo), and one ought to have the willingness to be take drastic measures to effect change, and be honest with them about what those measures are, in order to help the organization get out of its quagmire.",1361838942

I'm coming to you to talk about a bold web startup with a potentially pretty disruptive approach.
It's a web app called Blacklist, where users can Blacklist the brands and products they dislike or had a bad experience with.
The concept is pretty simple, yet very powerful: Its about giving the power to the people to have a voice to react after a bad consumer experience in order to get heard and impact accordingly.
The vision behind the product is to bring brands and companies closer for more aligned interactions with consumers. Its all about more transparency in the interactions consumers-companies. 
You can have a look on Twitter @Blacklist, on Facebook: apps.facebook.com/blacklist-app and on AngelList angel.co/blacklist
We are currently building the beta version starting in London.
If you want to get a glance you can check out the blog @ blog.blacklistapp.co

Many people claim that this is unusual behavior, but it's really not <i>in the context of the military</i> (even in the media, e.g. Apocalypse Now). Or differently, if an American officer had defected to the Nazis during WWII and was known to be in a certain bunker you can bet he would have been facing a bunch of incoming U.S. ordnance.<p>However speaking towards the second point for just a bit, the U.S. assassinated a Japanese Admiral (Adm. Yamamoto) during WWII and didn't wait for him to be in Japanese-controlled areas to do so. He was killed in international waters, and not even during a battle as we think of them. He was a militarily valuable officer in a military organization fighting the U.S. and off he went. And, even if he somehow managed to overfly some nation's airspace, he would have been hit as long as the nation involved would tolerate the incursion.<p>> Furthermore, many the citizens being assassinated have never even been accused of a crime.<p>Well, they have (insofar as the process as it's been released theoretically requires some form of justification). They haven't been accused in a courtroom, perhaps, but that's a civil law matter, not military/international law.<p>I want to stress real quick that I'm not even personally decided for/against on this issue myself, but I'm a firm believer in garbage in == garbage out and so I just wish to point out that this issue isn't as crystal-clear as it's sometimes made out to be. If we treat this as a military affair (and AQ certainly does) then there is plenty of reason to treat the U.S. reaction under military terms as well, and those are much muddier waters than civil/criminal law.",1361837116

It always seemed that the skinniest guys were AG's, loaded down with ammo, extra barrel, tripod, and T & E mechanism, while also having to carry an M16, and its ammo.<p>In all of my time in service, the only time I ever burnt my hand on a hot barrel was during OSUT, when a dickhead Drill Corporal had us all stand at attention after we'd formed up after being cleared from the firing line. It taught me a valuable lesson about how hot a weapon could get.<p>I have also seen an M60 barrel warp & bend after firing 1500 rounds non-stop.<p>As for putting the gun together incorrectly, I can see doing so in the heat of battle, or the fog (20+ hours a day on your feet, except while in the ""front-lean-&-rest"") of Ranger School, but have never seen such occur in normal training.<p>All in all, the M60 is still a venerable gun, and when proper tactics are employed (inter-locking fire) it is a more than capable weapon.<p>So much that, in one of my assignments, our platoon had 3 gun crews instead of the usual 2, because our PL had served multiple tours in Vietnam, and he knew the effectiveness of these guns - especially with 3 crews while doing a bounding overwatch.<p><i>""Fire a burst of six to nine.""</i>",1361836914

Impostor syndrome is not always something with a strictly internal origin. If people are dominating you and making you feel bad, and you become submissive, that is a pattern as old as primates and it shouldn't surprise us when it happens also when you are working with people who are extremely concerned with proving they or their clique are better than others.

It also suggested that women avoid risk, but not that they buckle.  Too much risk aversion can be destructive, but I could also see the identified male pattern here as being very destructive to a career as well.  Perhaps losing confidence, working frenetically, and using rapid change (impulsive job hopping) to escape a situation that actually doesn't need to be escaped, abandoning good relationships with people who don't think he's incompetent at all?",1361836840

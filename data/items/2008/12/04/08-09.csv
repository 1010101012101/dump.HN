My savings account is offset against my mortgage, so it's generally better to pay by credit card as that defers savings account withdrawals (thus saving mortgage interest) by up to 45 days.<p>The card fee is paid by reward points on the card and there's enough extra points per year for between $200 & $400 in store vouchers.<p>So combining the mortgage interest savings, the rewards payouts and the fact I pay no interest or annual fees, I'd guess the card saves me ~$1000 a year.<p>As a debit card is just as easy to use as a credit card, the argument that I'm likely to spend more with a credit card is bogus as well.<p>I suspect the fees Dave Ramsey would have to pay on credit card transactions may be higher than on debit cards though...",1228381160

385469,comment,385182,385267,0,0,msie,,,"Initially I was excited about 3.0 but as you pointed out it will take some time for modules to get converted over.  I think this is very important.  For me, one of the big selling points of Python is the large number of libraries written for it.  With my luck I will need to use an obscure library that won't be updated any time soon by the author.  So I'll have to stick with 2.5 or 2.6 because I need to get my job done rather than migrate a library.<p>It's sort of a chicken-and-egg problem because without widespread use of 3.0 no one will feel pressure to upgrade their library.  I'm hoping, out of the goodness of their own hearts, that everyone will upgrade their libraries (for no immediate benefit but the gratitude of 3.0 users!).  Maybe a website badge should be created for this accomplishment!",1228380431
385468,comment,385392,385392,0,0,newt0311,,,"GAAAHHHH!!! Enough with this credit cards are bad BS.<p>Cons with CCs: If you don't manage your funds well, you git hit with a 20%+ interest rate and will never likely climb out of that hole. Solution: learn to manage debt. Seriously, most CC companies now allow direct account transfers. If you are that scared, whenever you make a purchase, go home, log in to your bank's website (every major bank has one, if yours doesn't, open an account with one that does), and <i>pay off the card immediately</i>. Its not rocket science, just basic financial management.<p>Pros with CCs: Fraud protection. Easily one of the biggest plus points of CCs. Concerned that there is a charge on you statement that you didn't approve? Just call the company and tell them that it is a fraudulent charge and then <i>its their problem</i>. If nothing else, this easily makes credit cards worth the time it takes to manage them. After this, we have the easy record of all transactions, cash back, convenience, safety from the fact that you don't have a giant wad of cash with you, and last but not least, a credit history which can be used to reduce interest rates on long term loans.<p>Seriously, this anti-debt attitude is in general ridiculous. Is excessive and badly-managed debt bad? Absolutely, its one of the worst situations to be in but there is a simple way to avoid it: manage your finances. Swearing off all debt is foolish and inefficient.",1228380236

I can see the same reasoning coming from my father (who owns an architecture firm).<p>With business you're spending a lot of time in meetings, travelling for business or in various phone calls. To be sure, these things are taxing, but I get the feeling that one can do many more hours of these things in a week than one can with something like programming.<p>From that (business) perspective it seems natural that everyone else should work more. And I think that it's here where a wise manager will work longer (if it is in his or her interest, of course), but will not require the same of people whose jobs cannot support such a routine.<p>And I agree, Jason's advice is, in general, very sound.",1228379937

The current preview releases are pretty spot on though - so we're in a transitional phase. Ruby 1.9's performance is also somewhat better than that of 1.8.<p>On the 1.8 front, Ruby 1.8 has had what's called KCODE for years now, which enables Unicode support for various bits and pieces (primarily regular expressions).

We got overly interested in houses.<p>We have to produce before we can consume. Many of the brightest minds and much of our productive workforce became involved in building over-sized houses. There was much money/paper shuffling that basically boiled down to pretending lots of stuff about over-sized houses. We didn't need so many houses. Unfortunately, we borrowed that production capacity from ourselves in other areas. Now we're short on all sorts of the things we should have been producing instead of too many houses. We have to work extra hard now to get caught up on those things. Oh and all of the businesses that basically existed in order to make pretend money based on too many houses are hosed.<p>There.

385446,comment,384606,384799,0,0,RobGR,,,"There is only one Google, but there are many crumbling behemoths.  A few years ago I read a statistic about the percentage of the workforce employed by large traditional corporations, and it had continually dropped; but like a lot of statistics, it was not clear how it accounted for the trend in hiring temp or contract workers through third party front firms.<p>While the stability of large organizations over time, and the relative importance of all large organizations, are separate concepts, both are dropping.  While Mormonism or other religions may grow and shift, in general the trend is toward the less centrally organized sects, and the big centrally organized, heirarchical ones are becoming less so, and becoming more run by the lower levels of the organizational pyramid.<p>Of course the Pentagon is not just an office building.  Any reasonable person would believe that one of the hijacked airplanes could have been piloted into a NORAD installation if that had suited Al Qeada's purposes, but NORAD is only useful against other dying behemoths of giant organizations, such as the soviets, and thus isn't nearly as important as it used to be, and would never be bothered with by Al Qeada.<p>I think the reasons that we did not catch or kill Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora are exemplary of the ways that giant organizations fail.  We believed we were strong enough to pursue other goals at the same time (Iraq, various shifts in policy under the cover of the Patriot Act, etc) and thus tolerated various internal groups siphoning off resources to persue those goals, and when things did not go as expected, we could not move fast enough to get back on track, and the internal groups had grown too powerful to stop.  If we ever catch Osama it will probably be because we pay someone else to do it for us; I think that is loosely analogous to how IBM had to pay Bill Gates to write DOS for them, because their own internal politics and bureaucracy made it impossible for them to themselves.<p>One bullet point I left out of my list above, is higher educational institutions.  I remember in the early days of slashdot, the education career questions were all of the type ""should I go for a Phd. or settle for a Masters"" or ""the place I want to attend had Computer Engineering instead of Computer Science, does that matter"" and stuff like that.  Look at the educational career dicision questions on slashdot or here these days -- it is all variations on ""should I drop out"" ""how hard is it to get a job with no degree"" and so on.",1228378358

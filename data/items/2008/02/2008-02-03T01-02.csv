These are the people who make IP lawyers look exciting and rational.<p>IP Australia would NEVER suggest that people actually DO SOMETHING without spending $100K on legal and consultants fees.<p>They would know what an innovation was if it bit them on the bum. They just do not get it.<p>I have been trying to teach people how to do a startups for nearly 20 years. (yes, I am old)

But, obviously, they don't know how to make money on those 50x readers.  I don't either...but they're going to have to figure it out, or die a slow death.",1202002346

108525,comment,108433,108433,0,0,mdemare,,,"Just counting the tokens in the codetree is not an acceptable measure of brevity, because it implies that adding primitives to a language always makes it more powerful as long it makes your application shorter just once.<p>But adding primitives has a cost too. You could just have <i>let</i>, or you could have a <i>let</i> for one value, one for more values, one for more values initialized as nil, or as 0, or as an empty string, etc.<p>In Ruby I write expressions like this a lot:
    condition ? string : """"
I'd like to say:
    condition &&? string<p>This would make my applications shorter, but, I claim, less readable and no more powerful.<p>To measure power, it is not enough to look at succinctness - you must hold something else constant too.",1202001988

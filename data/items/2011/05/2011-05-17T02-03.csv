2555101,comment,2554087,2555037,7,0,mihasya,,,"So Canonical, a distribution maker, is not to be trusted for their kernel suggestions, but Amazon is infallible? On what basis?<p>We asked the Amazon kernel team if we should try switching to one of their kernels/distros, and they said ""No, just upgrade to Maverick and the accompanying kernel."" It's been pointed out that Maverick has its own set of Xen bugs. I guess Amazon doesn't know everything.<p>The horse you're getting on about using the ""proven"" Amazon kernels is a bit high. Turns out this whole virtualization thing is somewhat new, and the kinks are still being worked out. Old kernel builds don't work particularly well because a lot of their assumptions are broken by virtualization; new kernels are what they are - new.<p>(Edit, forgot initially): Finally, we ran 10.04 - the Long Term Support release of Ubuntu from a year ago. There was no ""because we can.""<p>Frankly, I'm a bit amazed at your disdain for people sharing their findings from practical experience running into these issues in high-load production environments.",1305601190

And then we have no way to verify anything that it did say, assuming it even started from the correct place, especially with regards to stability on geologic time. Even an 99.9999999%-per-hour perfect simulation will still diverge on geologic time scales. For all we know, an atmosphere with a mountain range <i>here</i> will freeze out in a century, whereas a mountain range <i>there</i> could in fact result in a stable atmosphere over geologic time. This is all information-theoretic necessity. This is entertainment, not science.<p>That may be all the scientists claimed.

Elements of the simulation are based wholly on proven, low-level physics (for example, calculating the amount of heat absorbed by a given amount of CO2 from a given amount of sunlight) whenever possible, and when that's infeasible the modelers test a range of possible values to see what happens. For example, you can't exactly calculate the density of condensation nuclei in the atmosphere (used for calculating cloud formation behavior), so they just ran the simulation with a bunch of believable values. Another example is pretty clearly laid out in the first sentence of the ""results"" section:<p><pre><code>  We performed simulations with 5, 10, 20 and 30 bar
  atmospheric pressure and 1:1, 1:2 and 1:10 orbit-rotation

You may not think it's that hard, and it may not be for someone whose sole job is to do just that, but for the vast majority of admins that are wearing many hats this is going to be a unneeded time sink.",1305598105

2555017,comment,2554941,2554941,16,0,jerf,,,"""After its discovery, it was generally believed that any atmosphere thick enough to keep the planet warm would become cold enough on the night side to freeze out entirely, ruining any prospects for a habitable climate.... To test whether this intuition was correct, Wordsworth and colleagues developed a new kind of computer model capable of accurately simulating possible exoplanet climates.... To their surprise, they found that with a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere -- a likely scenario on such a large planet -- the climate of Gliese 581d is not only stable against collapse, but warm enough to have oceans, clouds and rainfall.""<p>Question. How the <i>bloody hell</i> do you validate a computer model of how an atmosphere unlike anything we can observe in our solar system works? Did someone fly out there and verify it before publishing? And I'm supposed to believe your computer model iterates correctly over <i>geologic time</i>? Really? <i>Really?</i><p>(Obligatory-but-totally-serious that this is still cool work not counting the computer model part, and to be honest I don't really care either way what the computer model says; I would be equally skeptical if they produced a model that claimed any outcome at all.)",1305597850

But keep in mind that the ""reality"" you are talking about is in some aspects an artifact of the language in which the rest of the software system has been constructed. For instance, some edge cases (such as special treatment of nulls, some exceptions) happen to be less important in Clojure and other ""Java.next()"" languages.<p>I do hope someone will post an equivalent Clojure program. Unfortunately, my knowledge of Java is limited, and I have not touched Clojure in many months now, so cannot do it myself. Sorry.",1305597835

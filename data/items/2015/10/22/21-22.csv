Previously, you used to go through travel agents and tour operators who offered curated selections of hotels.

And the part he&#x27;s right about is what people find unfair.<p>He&#x27;s right in that Capitalism is not about marking up a product to generate a profit by taking the cost of the goods and the labor to produce it but rather by paying labor less than what their labor is worth.  And this is what bothers people.  It isn&#x27;t fair.  And they are helpless to change it.<p>And it is what is happening more and more.  And the eventuality of it is Capitalism will eat itself as those without will be large enough in numbers where they assume power.  Those which did the exploiting will either have their heads rolled or at the very least made impotent and marginalized.  This is revolution and leads to Socialism and eventually Communism.<p>The second part Marx argues is that only the State can sort out the best way to distribute means and goods - that the free market is too chaotic.  This I disagree with and I think time has shown this to be false.  The state will eventually be corrupt if it isn&#x27;t already.  And whose to say what is best for one person is also the best for the other?<p>So, the free market exists where people can pick and choose.  They have freedom.  This allows some to have more than others and I think people are in fact OK with that.  In fact I think people want that because we believe in getting what you&#x27;re worth.  Its just they don&#x27;t want their own labor to be discounted to the point of being exploited - which is happening more and more with through wage suppression via policy or globalism which has displaced a lot of people very quickly, even if it might eventually benefit everyone as a whole.",1445550421

By giving you a total ordering of which principal has written a claim on a name, you can achieve the &quot;secure&quot; property by applying a validation policy as a function of claim order to determine which principal the name points to.  For example, you might say that &quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&quot; shall refer to the <i>first</i> principal to claim it in the blockchain, and subsequent claims by other principals should be treated as invalid.<p>The reason to use a blockchain to store the history of name claims is simply because the blockchain is a trustless, decentralized data structure (achieving the &quot;decentralized&quot; point in the triangle).

Today - after perhaps a combined total of one year spent traveling on the European mainland - I still haven&#x27;t been to Italy (the closest I&#x27;ve been is perhaps Tunisia or Nimes), and interest is at an all-time low.<p>How could this loss of interest have been prevented?

Are Americans that much more disabled (than people of the Depression, WWII and Vietnam generations, and beyond)?  It strikes me as being highly implausible.  Based on some of the data presented here and elsewhere, it seems like it&#x27;s become another welfare program for many people, with some &quot;deserving&quot; individuals in between.  Some people, when not forced to work for their survival, will eschew it.  Others see it as free money, and just work for cash on the side.<p>To the moral question of the safety net: is it just for one to have earned X dollars (and spent Y amount of one&#x27;s life) working at a job, only to have the fruits of one&#x27;s labor forcefully taken away to fund his neighbor&#x27;s welfare/housing/food/schooling/etc.?  I would argue no.[0]  If someone is disabled or destitute, he can appeal to the charity of his family members, fellow human beings, or philanthropy to help him out.  There are plenty of people (many on these boards, I imagine) who have excess resources and would surely help a starving man in the street or an orphan.<p>Indeed, voluntary aid would fix the issue of worthiness which you raise: if you are worthy of help, you will be judged worthy to receive it.  (Charities and mutual aid societies have existed since at least the 19th century, and have proliferated even more-widely since.[1])  If not, time to start providing value to others (i.e., labor) and receiving money in exchange.

10435153,comment,10432704,10433411,0,0,Ologn,,,"> I knew nothing about data structures or algorithms but I could write a Ruby program.Now, three years later, I am taking online classes to learn about those issues. The more advanced I got, the more I needed those &quot;basics.&quot;<p>Data structures are not basics. Self-balanced binary tree graphs are not basics. More basic than that would be to learn what a graph is - Euler&#x27;s bridges, Dijkstra&#x27;s shortest path. More basic is the initial introduction to the concept of the graph and the set in discrete mathematics (as well as other discrete subjects like logic, combinations, probablility etc.)<p>Algorithms are not basics.  Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm is not basic.    More basic is theory of computation - Turing machines, lambda calculus, mu-recursive functions.  Automata theory, complexity theory, computability theory.  Basic does not necessarily mean easier, sometimes the abstractions can be harder to grasp.  What is the complexity of your algorithm, what&#x27;s the worst case big O notated case?  How is big O notation determined?  Can you even know what an algorithm is, or compare algorithms without knowing these things?  Then more basic than these things is the math such as calculus you may to determine some algorithms.<p>Frankly, if when &quot;looking back at myself at 18, there is no way I would have made it through a CS course. I had no motivation for school&quot; , and then you study Ruby for three months and get a job and are now taking online courses - I would be very skeptical of how deep your knowledge is.<p>You&#x27;re honest enough about what you did.  There&#x27;s also nothing wrong with being in a situation where you don&#x27;t have the opportunity to study CS intensively for four years under professors and grad students who have published papers in the field (although &quot;no motivation&quot; sounds worse than &quot;no opportunity at the time&quot;).  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being lucky enough to bootstrap yourself to your current situation, there&#x27;s everything wrong with <i>fooling yourself</i> that in five years, that kid in his third year of CS right now, who is dedicated to studying the things I mentioned, and who will study it next year, and who will then get a job and work for four years.  In five years he will be ahead of you.  He has a foundation that you don&#x27;t.  He will have a confidence you won&#x27;t.  As an interviewer I will be able to tell this.<p>My advice would be to look at local public colleges and see if any are good.  See what their CS programs are, how they deal with night/weekend students for CS majors (some required classes may be on a weekday at 1 PM) etc.  See what the pre-requisite graph is.  Then take one class a semester, at night or on weekends.  It will be one or two nights a week.  Maybe take an easy non-CS class first like art appreciation or something.  Note they often put one of the hardest courses for CS (like Calculus 101)  as an initial pre-requisite for all CS classes to weed out &quot;unmotivated&quot; people from burdening the school  CS program.  Keeping on the topic of the weed-out class though - if you struggle over Calculus 101 like we CS majors did, to where you&#x27;re even thinking of dropping out - wouldn&#x27;t that be a sign that we were learning things in school you didn&#x27;t know?  It&#x27;s not a laugh a minute to do Cook Turing reductions of NP problems in order to show similar properties of problems - but it does help in understanding fundamentals of CS.<p>It is better to think about this sooner than later.  People do these things when they&#x27;re in there teens or early 20s because it&#x27;s easier to do then.  You really don&#x27;t want to have this revelation after you have a child or two, and are having trouble finding good work because of no diploma and lack of fundamentals.   One bonus is the diploma is not the only payoff - even halfway through school you&#x27;ll be a better programmer, more attractive to some employers, will have met interesting professors and students (if you put yourself out there) etc.  You get out what you put in - professors like students who pay attention and do well, and can be helpful.",1445548659

Take a look at &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, a charming ditty from the late 17th century that features lyrics like this:<p><pre><code>  For I am a Maid and a very good Maid,\n     and sixteen years of age am I,\n  And fain would I part with my Maiden-head\n     if any good fellow would with me lye:\n  But none to me ever yet proffer&#x27;d such love,\n     as to lye by my side and give me a shove\n  With his dil doul, dill doul, dil doul,\n     O happy were I, etc.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/21716/citation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/21716/citation</a><p>The impression most people have of history is mere propaganda, a self-aggrandising origin story.

Most serious head injuries occur when there is insufficient clearance between the hood and the stiff underlying engine components. A gap of approximately 10 cm is usually enough to allow the pedestrian’s head to have a controlled deceleration and a significantly reduced risk of death[3]. Creating room under the hood is not always easy because usually there are other design constraints, such as aerodynamics and styling. In some regions of the hood it can be impossible. These include along the edges on which the hood is mounted and the cowl, where the hood meets the windshield. Engineers have attempted to overcome this problem by using deformable mounts, and by developing more ambitious solutions such as airbags that are activated during the crash and cover the stiff regions of the hood[4]. Some models, like the Citroën C6 and Jaguar XK feature a novel pop-up bonnet design, which adds 6.5 cm (2.5&quot;, C6) extra clearance over the engine block if the bumper senses a hit. In 2012 and 2015, the Volvo V40 and the Land Rover Discovery Sport have a under-the hood airbag with operates if the hood senses a hit. The airbag also covers the windshield pillars to provide better protection in all areas struck by the pedestrian&#x27;s head.&quot;\nthere&#x27;s a great wikipedia article about it.[1]<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_safety_through_vehicle_design"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_safety_through_vehi...</a>",1445548164

To the tunes of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.<p>Serious, everyone should make an effort to get even a basic financial education. It is by far the best investment choice you could make.

Everyone can submit pull requests with their improved codes and the authors should simply rerun the codes on a standard machine to get a benchmark. Obviously, a couple of rules should apply:<p>1. when you improve the code, do not move any elements outside the benchmarked language, i.e., don&#x27;t use mex files in Matlab, c++ in R etc.<p>2. maybe create two or three different versions of your code - single processor, multiple cpus, gpu and run it on a single machine with a predefined set up.<p>This will remove at least some of the criticism thrown at the economists and has an additional benefit: researchers trying to find the best-suited language for their problem can not only use speed but also expressiveness, aesthetics, code length, boilerplate and ease of use to guide their decision.",1404373259

7981934,comment,7981725,7981725,1,0,brianchu,,,"I&#x27;m also a sophomore (in CS) at Berkeley. My background is a bit similar - I took a year off <i>before</i> college to take a software course and work at a startup. The year I took off was probably one of the periods of greatest personal growth I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. I learned a lot technically, but that wasn&#x27;t the most important thing I gained (or even the second or third-most important thing). The most important things I gained were friendships and connections with people older than me, and greater <i>perspective</i> on my goals and on college. I like to think I&#x27;m a bit more street-smart than I used to be, having been exposed to the real world. It&#x27;s important to note that taking income minus taxes/expenses, I earned next to nothing over the course of that year (and have a bit of stock that isn&#x27;t worth much even if the startup continues to do well), so I gained nothing financially.<p>I don&#x27;t put much faith in the arguments that &quot;you&#x27;ll never go back&quot; if you take a year off - I did, and when I made the decision to go back, it was precisely that - a conscious decision, rather than how most students go to college (which is by following the default path). At any time, the decision is yours to return to college - if you decide not to return to school it will only be because you judge your current opportunity (the startup or wherever your career takes you) to be better than going to school.<p>Obviously the details of this opportunity are pretty important - how much equity are you getting? How much control? Who do you get to work with (the people you meet and/or work with is probably the single greatest factor in your early career)? How much funding do you get? How flexible is the parent company in letting you make decisions (remembering that if you don&#x27;t have >50% of the equity, they have final say in all decisions)?<p>If you want to take this offline, my email is in my profile. I wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to dismiss an opportunity like this. If you think your skills are up to it, it&#x27;s worth considering. <i>At the very least</i>, I would take the trip to Japan, and come prepared with tough questions for the executives (questions about control, autonomy, flexibility, the conditions of funding, how they make decisions, their philosophy around product management, etc.)",1404372517

(GPS is a good example, the satellites are 20,000km away and transmit at 25W, but GPS still works just fine!)<p>The basic equation is:<p><pre><code>  channel capacity in bits/second = bandwidth in Hz * log2(1 + signal power / noise power).  \n</code></pre>\nSo let&#x27;s say they are using 1MHz of spectrum (WiFi uses 20-80MHz), are transmitting at 1mW EIRP, and have an omnidirectional receiving antenna (there is no such thing, but &quot;assume a spherical cow&quot;, it&#x27;s the worst-case anyway).  At the claimed range of 4 miles, the signal will lose 100dB because of &quot;path loss&quot; (actually spreading out), giving you ~ 1e-10mW (-10dBm) of signal at the antenna.   Let&#x27;s set the noise floor at -60dBm which I have not really measured, but sounds good.  That&#x27;s 1e-6mW.  Plug this into our formula and you get a bitrate of about 1 bit every 7ms.  That&#x27;s ~20 bytes per second!<p>So let&#x27;s say that we want to collect a sample once a second from 256 devices.  We get 20 bytes per second, so can sample every 256 seconds (let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s 5 minutes).  There are 256 devices, so each one gets a 1 byte ID.  Then you have 19 bytes of payload, which is fine for things like thermometers or your FitBit or whatever.  Fill the rest with an error-correction code.<p>Now you have 256 devices, each using 0.01W of power for 1/256 of the time.  With a 5Wh cell-phone battery, that&#x27;s enough for 14 years of transmissions.<p>Now, to get thousands of devices, you can use more spectrum; there is plenty more in the ISM band.  You can transmit with more power, 0.01W is what a Raspberry Pi IO pin can transmit connected to a long wire.  You can get a directional antenna, since you probably aren&#x27;t listening for signals from the sky or underground.  You can also send less data.<p>Anyway, I ran the numbers and I don&#x27;t think this company is claiming to violate any laws of physics!  It all sounds quite possible, actually, with the right engineering work.  I&#x27;m looking quite forward to purchasing an eval board!",1404371573

Identify large orders and place small orders a de minimis amount ahead of them when the bid-offer spread is sufficiently large. If someone trades with your bid (offer), try to be the best offer (bid) to exit and make the spread. If the large order behind you starts trading, trade with it to lose 0.01.<p>I&#x27;ve traded these markets by hand before using relative value signals from other exchanges (e.g. buy on bitstamp if btc-e moves up and bitstamp hasn&#x27;t yet). You can&#x27;t really do pure arbitrages since it takes so long to move money around but if you can identify which market leads you can use that as a starting point for coming up with a fair price to trade around. I made money easily but gave up on trying to automate it since the volume is so low, bid-offer spreads are often tighter than 2*trading fees, you can&#x27;t short-sell easily/cheaply, exchanges seem incompetent or downright crooked, laughably bad APIs, etc.<p>These markets are wildly inefficient though. For a home day-trader or hobbyist there&#x27;s easy money to be made. It&#x27;s absurd how slowly price discovery trickles from one market to another. Most modern markets don&#x27;t even get mispriced by a penny for more than a few microseconds, but there are nickels, dimes, quarters and even dollars of mispricing to capture in BTC/USD markets clicking on the screen.<p>You could probably dominate with an algo, but how much can you really make in a market that trades 10s of millions in notional value a day? There are also way too many exceptional conditions to let it run even semi-unattended since the exchanges are too immature. Anyone who&#x27;s capable of doing it can make more doing the same thing on a real market.<p>ETA: Exchanges in this space are really, really bad. Some don&#x27;t even know about rounding errors when using floating point for prices.

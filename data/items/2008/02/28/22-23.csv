125734,comment,125317,125352,0,0,white,,,"Well, I'm not fully agree on the examples with Sergey and Max.   Sergey's father is a very qualified ex-soviet mathematician, he gave very good basics to Sergey.  Max moved to US when he was 16.  He's got grounds from the soviet education system, which was very different comparing to US.  So, their college choice (theoretically) could not change their fate. ;)<p>But in overall you're right.  Don't treat college as your pass to success, however it could be your backup, just in case if you're not that smart as you think. ;)",1204239515

So, the only opinions that matter are those of the 5% who sign up and use the service.   Everybody else is just thinking up reasons that this is either not needed, takes too much trouble, already has a better alternative, too busy to look into the site further and then forgets about it, doesn't feel the site is safe or secure, doesn't feel they know the author, think it costs too much money, thinks it costs too little money, or thinks the idea is too simple and therefore must be put down because, who do these people think they are, writing free web apps for the public--Mother Teresa?

But I must say that 3 months ago I switched back to a Mac after 10 years away, and while I like it much, much better than Windows, it's absolute bullshit to talk about Apple or Mac OS X like the quality is infinitely better. On that front, I find both my hardware and software to be just as flaky and crappy as the Dell/Windows hell to which I had become accustomed. Laptop wakes from sleep? Usually. Machine locks up?

It's a chapter from ""Men, Machines, and Modern Times"" by Elting Morrison <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Machines-Modern-Times-Elting-Morison/dp/0262630184/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Machines-Modern-Times-Elting-Morison/d...</a> which also makes great reading.<p>Elting Morrison makes the point that the modern naval gunnery was enabled by the intersection of metallurgy advances that could build longer strong gun barrels giving improved range, improved optics so that you could see and range find what you were aiming at since it was a mile or more away, an elevating gear to compensate for the rolling motion of the deck.<p>Together these three inventions enabled a continuous aim firing method that saw 175x increase in the rate of effective fire in 6 years: ""After twenty-five minutes of banging away, two hits had been made on the sails of the elderly vessel. Six years later one naval gunner made fifteen hits in one minute at a target 75 by 25 feet at the same range–1600 yards; half of them hit in a bull’s eye 50 inches square.""<p>I had included it in  a longer blog entry about Paul Saffo speaking on forecasting technology \n<a href=""http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2007/08/28/paul-saffo-on-forecasting-innovation-in-silicon-valley/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2007/08/28/paul-saffo-on-foreca...</a>",1204237587

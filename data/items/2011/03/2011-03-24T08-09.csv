If you launch, get featured (top billing & visibility in app store), and have terrible initial reviews (1,2,3 stars), odds are you won't get featured again, which will make it extremely difficult to gain traction organically as your app improves, since you're now competing with ""five hundred thousand other apps"" for eyeballs down in the pile.<p>First reaction to your app is hugely important now, not like a website 'where you can come back and come back again'.<p>He compares to Path and some other apps, Path had same problem - bad first experience.  No one else in Half Moon Bay using these local photo apps yet, so useless there on launch (and presumably anywhere else there aren't many initial local users).  Foodspotting on the other hand had pics from the middle of Montana.<p>Problem when you take so much money ($41 million for Color.com), too much pressure to go large on first night, leading to disaster in this case.

Now, the law might not like punishing breach of contract with long-term imprisonment (or whatever the penalty for treason is), but you could probably work something out--e.g. if he breaks contract, then he retroactively loses all access privileges, and all those times he accessed top-secret data are now considered trespass.<p>(This seems in fact quite appropriate to me, because then the punishment is proportional to the extent to which the general misused the privileges given to him.  If he was new to the job and they didn't show him much of anything, then they have little to complain about him breaking their trust; if he's spent ten years getting his fingers in all their data with their conditional permission, and now they realize they shouldn't have allowed him, then they have a <i>lot</i> to complain about.)<p>The case of shouting ""fire"" in a crowded theater can be handled similarly: Customers agree not to do that sort of thing as a condition of being allowed into the theater, and if they break that, then they are guilty of trespass.  You might complain that the customers didn't agree to any such thing, and that implicit contracts are bad.  Fine, then the theater can put up a sign that says ""You are not allowed to falsely shout 'fire'"".  As a matter of fact, I have seen many fire alarms in large buildings with a sign that says something like ""$NNN fine for spurious triggering of this alarm"".<p>The point is, there is no need to count <i>any</i> of these situations as cases where freedom of speech breaks down.  These things can be illegal without allowing any chinks into your free-speech armor; they can be punished, not because they're an illegal form of speech, but because of something else.",1300953865

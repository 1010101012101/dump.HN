I'm not sure how they're getting money - is they idea that people that join up donate to the cash pool they use to reward people who find prior art on existing patents?<p>Also it doesn't go quite as far as I'd like - it reduces the incentive to lodge bogus patents (as hopefully they'll stand for less time), but I'd still like their to some level of penalty to the originator when bogus patents are overturned (but that's a law change - somebody pointed out on a previous thread apparently Texas now has a law penalizing people that bring frivolous suits - not quite the same as filing for frivolous patents, but I still like it).<p>Edit: ah, followed links to \n<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2008/11/startup-crowdsources-patent-vetting-for-profit.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2008/11/startup-crow...</a>\nApparently they take research requests from clients, presumably for money.

Am definitely looking to improve features and functionality so will do so in a bit.<p>I can't remember how I decided to learn Ruby on Rails specifically (versus another language/framework), but I left my corporate job in Jan and started to seriously learn a week later. These are some of the resources I used in relative order:<p>1. <a href=""http://www.tryruby.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tryruby.org/</a>\n2. <a href=""http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/beginning#top"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/beginning#top</a>\n3. <a href=""http://railsforzombies.org/labs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsforzombies.org/labs</a>\n4. <a href=""http://railscasts.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railscasts.com/</a> (For specific video tutorials)\n5. <a href=""http://railsforum.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsforum.com/index.php</a> (For specific questions)\n6. <a href=""http://www.stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stackoverflow.com</a><p>I honestly picked up most of the basics from the Michael Hartl tutorial (second link), and then through googling specific features I wanted to add. I did a bunch of long-walks-and-turnarounds (eg: tried to put together my own authentication system for a week before I discovered Devise), but going from nothing to some basic knowledge took me around 3 weeks of plugging away.<p>I was (am still) working on a completely unrelated startup, so Kickass was a dedicated project initially but then became a side thing over the next few months. I've just finished the MVP on my own for my startup platform which is much more sophisticated than Kick Ass.<p>So it's been about 5 months, but about 3 weeks initially just pushing hard, and then bits and pieces over the next few months. I spent about 5 days a few weeks ago just focused on Kick Ass to finish it with the current features, and then spent another few days figuring out the infrastructure stuff (setting up the server, deploying to prod, database basics, etc).<p>But it's extremely simple - knowing what I know now, I could redo it from scratch in a few days. But if you're starting from zero like I did, then it'll be a few weeks of hard slog before things start making sense.<p>Definitely doable, and completely worth it - did some sales stuff this week demo'ing the startup MVP I built myself, and that's been a really good feeling. I know nothing about design or CSS, so once the functionality for the MVP was done I grabbed a theme off themeforest.net<p>Good luck with your learning! Hope to see your project here soon.",1307000518

2611086,comment,2610243,2610243,5,0,jamesaguilar,,,"This post neatly demonstrates some things I don't like about Scala. Background: I've spent thirty or forty hours programming toy projects in Scala. That's not a whole lot, but it's enough that some things should start making sense . . . and they haven't.<p><pre><code>    (1 to 10) map { _ * 2 }\n    (1 to 1000).reduceLeft( _ + _ )\n    List(49, 58, 76, 82, 88, 90) partition ( _ > 60 )\n</code></pre>\nI guess one common syntax for this pattern isn't sufficient. :( To be perfectly clear about my objection, these are the same basic operation: call a function on an iterable with an additional function argument. One is dotfree and uses braces. One uses a dot. And one is dotfree and uses parens. I feel like it would be a lot better if there were only one way to do this.<p><pre><code>    (words.foldLeft(false)( _ || tweet.contains(_) ))\n</code></pre>\n|| . . . in every other language that means ""logical or"". What non-intuitive connotation does it have here?<p><pre><code>    val results = XML.load(""http://search.twitter.com/search.atom?&q=scala)\n</code></pre>\nOh man, why can't it be XML.parse(URL.fetch(...)).<p><pre><code>    (n: Int) => (2 to n) |> (r => \n        r.foldLeft(r.toSet)((ps, x) => if (ps(x)) ps -- (x * x to n by x) else ps))\n</code></pre>\nThis language has a damn operator fetish. This is sort of ok . . . I suppose these operators mean something to someone, but why do they have to also break conventions by doing things like creating a binary --.<p>Despite these complaints, and many others, I'm still weirdly drawn to this language. I want a smaller version of this. Managed, non-crazy (I'm looking at you, Go), and providing functional features. But I want that in a package that doesn't give me ten million billion different ways to do the same thing.",1307000095

2611060,comment,2610530,2610782,5,0,Derbasti,,,"Wow, you just blew my mind there! But now that you say it it makes total sense. Have a tablet style computer on the go, plug it into a dock and transform it into a desktop style computer. This is brilliant!<p>One obvious implication of this is <i>the death of the desktop computer</i>. For the first time, this OS is not designed for desktop-only computers.<p>I wonder how they plan to integrate applications that need big screens like software development or graphic design into the experience. After all, big screens don't lend themselves for touch. Maybe you would plug in your mobile device and it would show the Metro UI, but a big external monitor would only show classic UI. (Maybe with some touch-stuff in a sidebar)<p>It will also be interesting how they will integrate hardware upgradability. That pretty much exclusively works with desktop towers, wich is at odds with mobility.<p>GNOME3, Unity, Lion, Windows 8... There is a lot of UI innovation going on! Interesting times, I must say!",1306999319

The thing I am thinking of is when they decided that the internet and XML was it, and decided to make everything XML (ie Avalon). Another thing was .NET and the CLR, when they decided to throw their old VS codebase away and start over simply because now, ALL programs released HAVE to be CLR-based.

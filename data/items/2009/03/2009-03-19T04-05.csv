522868,comment,522383,522625,0,0,gensym,,,"Nice. Here's more detail, following my thought process:<p>On first glance, it seems that any prisoner would gain no information on seeing the other prisoner's caps. Therefore, it's just a 50/50 shot, so the best strategy for the prisoners is to pick one ahead of time who will flip his switch (and the others will not).<p>However, when you enumerate the possibilities (BBB, BBW, BWB, etc.), you can see that following frankus's strategy will provide a 3/4 chance of survival.<p>This apparent paradox goes away once you recognize that, in fact, seeing the 2 prisoners caps does, in fact, provide information to the 3rd prisoner. That information is not the color of the cap, but whether another may have flipped his switch.<p>For example, if I am a prisoner, and I see two black caps, there are two scenarios:<p><pre><code>  - I'm wearing a white cap. If I don't flip the switch, we all die. If I do, we live.

  - I'm wearing a black cap. If I flip the switch, we die, but if I do not, we die anyway (since other prisoners incorrectly flipped the switch).</code></pre>",1237438010

It is -very- possible that one of these allocators will handle our memory footprint more gracefully than say, libc. There is only one way to find out: via A/B testing.<p>I think the important thing to keep in mind is that assertions like:<p>""I think this is pretty key, because otherwise TCMalloc is somewhat of an overhead.""<p>are a bit subjective, IMHO. Allocators are different from one another, and of course they react to a series of allocations/deallocations differently. We're trying to find out if the way we use our heap is better suited to another allocator like tcmalloc, or nedmalloc, or whatever.<p>And RE: multi-threaded - I don't believe it will be particularly difficult to get a representative sample, but working on that isn't very high on my list right now.",1237437675

What I have found, by trial and eror, is that over half of ALL the currently available (and some beta) 3rd party apps work PERFECTLY WITHOUT any signup or twitter cred.

522845,comment,522786,522786,0,0,patio11,,,"Is there a compelling reason why the biologist and the programmer need to be the same person?<p>It looks to me like researchers have figured out specialization of labor: one well-educated researcher to make the theory, several low-wage grunts who get to feed the rats.  (Whether this relationship is fair to graduate students is outside the scope of this post.)<p>I think we're suggesting people learn programming so that they can do tasks which are of comparative complexity to feeding the rats.  Converting data from one form to the other?  That is feeding rats.  Iterating over data to produce summary statistics?  That is feeding rats.<p>(I know biologists work with really big data sets.  So maybe they're not feeding rats, they're feeding monkeys.  Disgustingly parallel algorithms are getting easier and arranging the hardware for them is getting easier: in a few years, the monkeys will be about as easy to feed as rats are today.)<p>Biologists don't have grad students scratch-build their own microscopes, do they?  That would be silly.  Why not have the scientists and proto-scientists concentrate on science and outsource the feeding of computational rats to someone who doesn't really need a graduate degree in bioinformatics.<p>Plus, if using cheap outsourced rat-feeders achieves comparable quality to graduate students, there will be less market need for a permanent underclass of rat feeders with crushing debt loads and stipends that make McDonalds look generous.",1237436278

It was still a log slog to make 1% gains in market share. People didn&#x27;t even think of browsers as an application you can replace. It was just the internet.<p>Firefox won by being good enough that users nagged other users into replacing IE. They definitely were and I think we have FF to thank for a lot of the improvements to the web. I love it when companies compete simply on being better.

This set us back quite a bit. However, we’re now at the stage where the game is back to its original functionality&quot;<p>On the &quot;being able to deliver&quot; axis, you represent yourself as slow (over 1 year for a demo might be acceptable, but 9 months for a rewrite are a lot, smelling of part-time amateur development), prone to waste time with failed experiments (and persisting despite technical problems), unrealistically ambitious and/or unfocused (Windows and Mac and Linux and and iOS and Android? When high budget companies choose between Android and iOS?). \nConsider what the numerous software developers and software project managers on HN are likely to think of rewriting software from scratch, regardless of your sound technical reasons.<p>&quot;The game plays like a cross between A Link to the Past and Mass Effect, and takes some inspiration from Iain M. Banks’ Culture novels - along with whatever else can be scraped from an imagination fired by years of reading brilliant science fiction. Gameplay focuses around Ra’s ability to use magic, and the player can find many new spells as they explore the game’s universe. It’s not all action, though - players will come up against a variety of puzzles, ranging from mildly vexing to fiendishly tricky.&quot;<p>On the &quot;fun game&quot; axis, you have very little to show. You sure like your game, but TELLING it&#x27;s fun is vastly different from SHOWING it&#x27;s fun. Descriptions like this one are simply too generic to suggest how well you are meeting the stated objectives.\nAt least for me, the inexplicably low resolution graphics are particularly troublesome: whether they are the bizarre product of strange tastes or just a cheap and ugly placeholder, the concern over their quality projects on all other aspects of the game. \nIf an artist thinks that much smaller sprites than on the Atari 2600 are appropriate for HD screens, explaining how and why it&#x27;s the best choice for your game needs to be a very important part of your message, or the public will assume the worst (you aren&#x27;t giving the due attention to graphics and/or you are unable or unwilling to draw anything better).",1397471754

Sympathy with Guido; this is essentially a cultural problem rather than a technical one, but as a rule backwards-compatibility tends to be a key component of success as a programming language (or library, or even O/S) evolves.<p>It&#x27;s not too late -- a compromise could be found, but it would essentially involve abandoning 3 to a large extent. Not very palatable.<p>I&#x27;m sure Python has many years to go though, so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about writing new code for the moment.

Actors aren&#x27;t like people in an office. Actors can&#x27;t complain when you entangle them in a hot mess, they just carry on with whatever they&#x27;re told to do.<p>But the more experience I gain, the more I see the systems of the &quot;real world&quot; are in fact exactly like the systems of the &quot;computer world&quot;. If something makes no sense in an organization made of people, then almost inevitably it&#x27;ll make developers cry when having to figure out the sequence of events when implementing the same organization as a set of actors.<p>Take it as a useful heuristic and humor my analogies. You might find a nugget of gold there.<p>Also, there&#x27;s nothing blasphemous if my supervisor <i>can</i> be implemented as synchronous imperative code. When people hear about a new paradigm, they believe they have to abandon everything and <i>do things differently</i> for no reason. No. Find some balance, what you knew still works, don&#x27;t throw it out, just add the new benefits Actor offers to you.<p>I.e. while Actors mean we can have objects that do things that you can&#x27;t do in imperative/synchronous fashion, this <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean we should never use actors for something that <i>might</i> be done in imperative/synchronous fashion. 90% of the interactions between actors still look like a request/response pattern. But those 10% when things <i>don&#x27;t</i> look like a request/response really matter when you need that ability.<p>Also keep in mind Actors don&#x27;t care how far its subordinates are. In synchronous programming things have to happen fast, or the thread blocks. With actors a request may be sent this week, and you may get an answer next month. Things can happen very fast, or very slow, the model is not biased. How fast is fast enough is now entirely up to your app&#x27;s domain logic.<p>Also, some Actors implement persistence (which is far more trivial than trying to persist the callback graph or call stack in &quot;normal&quot; code), so they don&#x27;t even care if the system shuts down and it has to start over from its last state.<p>Imagine OrderActor sends a call to FraudCheckActor and then the system crashes, or (if it&#x27;s a business workflow process) it&#x27;s just powered down for the night.

7585361,comment,7581865,7582424,6,0,gjm11,,,"This is an excellent answer but there&#x27;s one important mistake in it that needs fixing. It occurs twice.<p>1. &quot;<i>or, in more normal usage, unions and variants</i>&quot;. A union is not a product type, it&#x27;s an unsafe sort of sum type. (The safe sort is sometimes called a &quot;tagged union&quot;.) And while &quot;variant&quot; means exactly what you want it to, it&#x27;s a Microsoft-ism that not everyone will be familiar with.<p>So: in C-speak, product and sum types are structs and (tagged) unions. In Microsoft-speak, product and sum types are structures and variants.<p>2. &quot;<i>and 3D points a standard union ADT</i>&quot;: again, it&#x27;s not a union but a struct.<p>A few other remarks that may help people unfamiliar with this sort of syntax make sense of what you wrote:<p>3. That notation &quot;Double -> Double -> Double -> Point&quot; can be read as &quot;a function taking a Double, and another Double, and another Double, and returning a Point&quot;. The weird notation is because <i>actually</i> it parses as Double -> (Double -> (Double -> Point)), and means it&#x27;s a function taking a Double and returning a function taking a Double and returning a function taking a Double and returning a Point! The word to look up if that doesn&#x27;t make sense but you&#x27;d like it to is &quot;currying&quot;.<p>4. Relatedly, there is no distinction between a <i>value of type T</i> and a <i>function of no arguments returning type T</i>. That&#x27;s why <i>tel</i> wrote &quot;Zero : Nat&quot; without any arrow anywhere on the right-hand side. You can (and maybe should) think of this as a function from (nothing) to Nat.<p>5. (This is implicit in what <i>tel</i> wrote but may be a stumbling block for the newcomer.) When you see something like &quot;data Point = Point Double Double Double&quot; it may not be obvious that the four things on the right-hand side are not at all on an equal footing. The first one (Point) is the name of a constructor. The others (Double Double Double) are the types of its arguments.",1397470493

It should be possible to add range requirements to numeric types (e.g. i > 5), and (non-)equality requirements for most types. Intersections and unions of these requirements is trivial, so the compiler could work out possibly allowed and disallowed value (ranges). If we only allow these simple constraints, it is essentially constraint-solving at compile time. The compiler can &quot;understand&quot; these simple types, and it can see that a positive int (or a non-null Vehicle) is required, and propagate that backwards and see whether it is violated.<p>(One could go a bit further and add almost arbitrary expressions (of C++11 constexpr strength). If the compiler can&#x27;t convert the expression to a union or intersection of things it understands, it can still check if a given constant violates the condition. E.g. it is known that x=5, and the precondition of a function is x<i></i>2 != 25, then this is a violation. I don&#x27;t know how useful this would be, though. One could also add &quot;lemmas&quot; to aid the compiler, e.g. &quot;I guarantee that x > 10 in this branch&quot;.)",1397469927

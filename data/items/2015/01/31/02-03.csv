The alternatives in school and life to which I am referring are pursuits such as medicine, mathematics, programming, electronics, chemistry, politics, business management and so forth.<p>It&#x27;s a clich√© which I wouldn&#x27;t think I would have to repeat, but I would love to see people get as excited about mathematics stars in schools as basketball players. I would love to see more people who get as excited about their city council as football drafts. I would love to see the money spent on stadiums and television sports networks spent on improving peoples lives in concrete ways other than entertainment.<p>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t consider sports legitimate entertainment. Clearly people feel that their lives are enriched from participating or spectating. Great. Good for them. The problem I see is a matter of priority. Society as a whole treats watching other people play sports as if it&#x27;s something as critically important, heck, more important than say, hospitals.",1422673175

8975699,comment,8970466,8970768,0,0,kelnos,,,"<i>And dwelling on how disgustingly annoying the online social justice movement is instead of solving its problems is one facet of geek culture that is just somewhat pathetic.</i><p>I think the difference here is that many geeks are of the mindset that it should be &quot;easy&quot; for them to help, both in action and emotionally.  Constantly being berated for &quot;not helping exactly the right way&quot; puts people in a foul mood.  The bottom line is that there aren&#x27;t many easy-to-see benefits for non-oppressed allies.  Basically many geeks see it as the less-privileged asking them for help, with nothing really in it for them except constantly being taken to task for not being immediately perfectly sensitive to all the issues women and people of color face.<p>It&#x27;s a little disingenuous to both vehemently assume, expect, and require that sensitivity while at the same time saying &quot;there&#x27;s no way you can possibly understand the struggles we face&quot;.

I now use Firefox for two reasons: One, the UI is better than Chrome/Chromium with hundreds of tabs active, and two I now simply periodically clear out long term tabs when I no longer have an immediate need for them by bookmarking them.<p>My friends think I&#x27;m insane by keeping so many tabs open. Maybe I am. Maybe you are, too. Yet with as disorganized as it might seem to others, it works well for my particular usage patterns. (It also helps that I segregate news, work, misc. activities into different profiles, too.) The thing is that sometimes when you open something that you want to get back to at some indeterminate point in the future, you can do one of two things: Bookmark it and forget about it, possibly permanently; or keep it open and stumble upon it as you go through your tabs to categorize them and clean them out. Although these days, I mostly just dump everything into a dated but uncategorized list to go through in the future. Session Manager handles the rest in the event I do something stupid.<p>I imagine I&#x27;ll catch some flak for sharing this, but it works well for me. My work-related browser sessions are usually better organized and important stuff gets saved more or less immediately. My &quot;fun&quot; generic browsing instances--not so much.",1422672445

8975648,comment,8972179,8972179,0,0,rohunati,,,"I am always puzzled at how &quot;high brow&quot; people scoff at sports. There is so much to learn from athletes. MJ, Kobe, Tom Brady -- these guys have all the skill in the world, but  more impressive than their skill is their incredible work ethic. I feel there&#x27;s a lot to learn here.<p>For example, one of Kobe&#x27;s conditioning trainer&#x27;s had this to say:<p>&quot;When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn‚Äôt even 5AM.<p>We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that we parted ways and he went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow.&quot;<p>Later on, around 11AM, the trainer sees Kobe on the court, practicing with the USA Olympic Squad, and has this conversation:<p>&quot;So when did you finish?&quot;<p>&quot;Finish what?&quot;<p>&quot;Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?&quot;<p>&quot;Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah, just now.&quot;<p>...<p>This is not unique to Kobe, you find stories like this with all athletes in conversation for &quot;greatest of all time.&quot;<p>Secondly, there&#x27;s a lot to learn from coaches as well, especially from the perspective of a startup founder. There&#x27;s a reason Keith Rabois brought up the Bill Walsh&#x27;s (SF 49ers coach) book, &quot;The Score Takes Care of Itself,&quot; in the HTSAS lecture series.<p>Lastly, watching sports at a high level is like appreciating great art. A great backhand in tennis, a brilliant pass by a quarterback, these all have a quality of beauty about them. I feel they induce similar awe-inspiring feelings one might find in an art museum, a great music album, etc.",1422671349

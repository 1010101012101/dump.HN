1666782,comment,1666445,1666762,0,0,scott_s,,,"That's true, but does it change my point?<p>Let me clarify. Consider if I instead chose <i>equal</i> and <i>not equal</i> as my operators. Now a ""small change"" probably won't even be a valid program (<i>not wqual</i>). Any small change that does result in a valid program is unlikely to result in an equally small behavior change for any interesting input. Changing a strictly-less-than to a less-than-or-equal-to is a small change that results in what seems like a small behavior change when viewed locally. But my own experience with programming is that a local change such as that will have huge consequences later on - often to the point that the program crashes.<p>Consider it this way: the space of valid programs is infinite. The space of valid programs that solve a particular problem is much smaller (in the physics << sense) than the space of valid programs. Any perturbation from a valid program that solves the problem is much more likely (>>) to land you on a valid program that does not solve your problem than one that does.",1283785142

That is the reason they are not going to succeed.<p>I still don't think the technology is there. Current stereoscopic offerings don't (can't, perhaps) produce an acceptable simulation of a 3D space.<p>Stereo sound can be faithfully reproduced by multiple speaker setups or even perfectly reproduced by headphones. It's acceptance didn't just hinge on tasteful, realistic usage of the technology but also the fact that it's ""close enough"" that our brains can fill in the details.<p>Current 3D technology (at least what I've seen in movie theaters) cannot represent a HUGELY important sensory feedback loop <i>at all</i> in that if you move your head the picture doesn't shift.<p>Consider any object in your office. Attempt to investigate and understand it's shape and position with respect to yourself. You, I nearly promise, just wiggled your head back and forth to scan the object and make fuller use of our inherent depth perception machinery. Until that can be accurately simulated with a 3D tv, I don't believe in it. Until that can be accurately simulated for multiple observers with a 3D tv, I don't believe in their use beyond a few first person shooters.<p>There are of course people doing cool stuff with that kind of technology. Cue the obligatory movies of that guy who uses Wiimotes to track head motion. Totally amazing stuff! I believe his tech can get so much closer to truly deceiving my brain into believing the 3D experience than Avatar did and it makes use of a normal TV.<p>As a final coffinnail, even if Wiimote headtracking tech does get into everyone's homes, that stuff depends on having a complete model of the space you're viewing.

Segregation trumped density or sustaintability.<p>Freight rail has indeed declined in South Africa, partly because of corruption, but the neglect started many years before.

Long wall of text ahead, sorry, but hopefully details will help.<p>I've been working at a startup since the beginning of the year. It has been good thus far -- great environment, great people, great time. I'm the only programmer and our products absolutely require this company to have a programmer on staff. I'm very much enjoying the work -- this wasn't in my area of expertise before (the business end) but I'm really getting a knack for understanding how our product fits in the field. And further, I've been able to really develop my skills to be a versatile programmer/dev. ops. guy.<p>The problem is that I'm looking at the calendar, and listening to all the conversations about sales and what not, and thinking: ""Man, this company is probably going to go belly up around Christmas."" And while in this part of the world, it wouldn't be too hard for a programmer to get work -- even freelance work until the post-Christmas doldrums -- I'd really not want to be out of work around Christmas. I have mega bills (student loans) and am very fastidious about money.<p>At this point, I'm trying to keep the whole thing very un-personal even though I'm really good friends with all of the founders (CEO/CFO/COO). But, I think it should be noted that as we launched one of our first products a few weeks back, all three founders took vacation the week/weekend before the launch -- it was assumed that I'd get the project done on time, so I ended up canceling mine. So, at the end of the day, I'm wondering if the Godfather quote comes into play -- ""This is business not personal.""<p>Further -- the company is trying to figure out how to stay afloat, and one of the ideas is to start doing consulting. Which sounds fine, but I came from a consulting/agency background specifically to leave that type of work; so while I would gladly help these guys out if we were doing it while working on the core products, this new model where we give up the core products for five or six months is just not very appetizing.<p>I know there are other startups interested in me -- they've reached out to me -- but I'm just not sure what to do when the boat is sinking. I understand if I was a skin-in-the-game cofounder, then like a captain, its down with the ship. But what if I'm just one of the first employees, who still has no equity (that discussion was had and they decided I'd get a ""big"" share, once we became revenue neutral) and who has enough bills and student loans to not be comfortable with the idea of one day paychecks just stop coming?<p>Thanks for any insight or personal experiences...",1283782894

1666701,comment,1666239,1666239,0,0,kls,,,"We script everything so that it is an automated script further all of our process is managed in JIRA. So when we do a release, the production manager decides whats in and what out via JIRA, based on that, our script takes those ticket numbers, goes to our source control system and moves the associated code into a release branch, tags it and automatically deploys it to a testing server, the release is verifies and tested. If good, the production manager then goes back to Jira and marks it as tested. The system then deploys the release to production and once verified merges that branch back to the head.<p>OK so what happens in the actual release? We do a rolling release in which the script goes to the router and re-routes traffic to the other servers (basically takes a server off line). The script then deploys to the server, brings it up verifies it and then turns traffic back onto the server.<p>A couple of principals that we live by are that are back end applications are REST services, we don't do Java, or RoR, or .NET apps, we do REST middleware with a language, ours is Java but it could be any. This is a huge distinction because it means that we don't do JSP, JSF or any of the other server side frameworks. This makes our server side very easy to mange.<p>Also we don't use session. All of our services are stateless. Which means we can drop in a new service or section of an overburdened service to dedicated hardware with out all the implications of session. This allows us to handle traffic without having to deal with the context of that traffic. If we experience heavy load on the profile service we can drop in 4 new boxes with the profile service on it and route request to those boxes. We don't have constraints that require them to go back to the same box they have a session on or complex session management infrastructure to ensure context is there for a user when a request comes into that box. Basically any request, at any time, can be services by any box, with no need for external information from outside the request. It is completely stateless.<p>On the database side all developers write delta scripts that take the database from A to B. We also take the cumulative patch set apply them together and generate a clean version x.x DB script that is more efficient. when a release goes out the scripts are run against a DB that is taken off line and that DB is brought up in unison with the app server that is at release x.x.<p>As well with the DB, we have a script that exports fairly static information that is in the DB out to static json files on the web server.<p>Finally, we don't template html files on the server, we write JavaScript UI apps that pull data from the json files and the REST services, we use a CMS to do templating and the CMS exports static HTML to the web server. Dynamic info is overlaid on the client side via JavaScript. This makes the web assets deployments drop dead simple.",1283782484

Except in Berlin people won't stop to help her when she pretends to fall getting off the train, they'll spit at her or throw trash.<p><i>My friend David Abraham, a historian and legal scholar, gave a fascinating talk at the American Academy in Berlin in which he suggested that the European welfare state is linked to ethnic homogeneity: people are more willing to share with those who seem like themselves.</i><p><i>Muslim immigration will be the moral test, and not just for Germany but for the rest of Europe as well.</i><p>I know the article is about Germany. But there's ample, recent, evidence that <i>when</i> the welfare states of Europe have problems, it's blamed (fairly or unfairly) on immigrants. Similarly in the U.S., anti-immigration proponents often blame the drain recent immigrants have on social services as part of the justification for extreme policies.<p>Recent mass deportation events in France show that this sentiment is probably true. Likewise, in the time I've spent in Germany, many people expressed discontent with the wave of Muslim immigrants and the subsequent strain on the welfare state of all these new, poor, undereducated people suddenly showing up to the new promised land.<p>Europe is undergoing some massive growing pains as it has emerged as the new go-to place for the poor unwashed masses of the world. These massive waves of immigration are very new to the continent (and especially to the individual countries).<p>But I think the American experiment can show that in the long run, relatively open immigration policies pay off. Everybody forgets that the poor unwashed masses from a foreign country that suddenly show up on your shores are there for primarily one reason...to work and to work hard. That kind of free, positive, energy needs to be harnessed. In two or three generations it pays off with so many ways. If it's not harnessed, it goes someplace else, often not in a constructive way. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Riots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Riots</a>",1283782383

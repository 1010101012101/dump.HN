I work a lot with Symfony2 in PHP and that kind of Object serialization thing is pretty much built in. I just return my model from the controller and it gets serialized to JSON including child objects with pretty fine grained controls about what to serialize.<p>Besides, after working a lot with REST webservices and AngularJS, i don&#x27;t know if serializing child objects is really a good idea vs just getting the id and then using the api endpoint for the specific children separately. Having child objects serialized creates problems when doing PUT/UPDATE requests and you can also end up with fairly large sets of JSON. Of course doing dozens of requests instead (especially for lists) is also not the best of ideas, so i am not really sure how others handle this ?",1422618984

The larger the team, and a fortiori the number of teams, the bigger that overhead is. Smacking people about the head with PEP8 goes quite close to solving the problem in the Python world, but CS&#x27;s Rubyish commitment to TIMTOWTDI militates against that.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s like SASS vs. SCSS. Or Haml vs. ERB. I can&#x27;t, for the life of me figure out why anyone would prefer more to less.&quot;<p>Because HTML and CSS, despite their verbosity, are <i>linguae francae</i>. A CSS file is valid SCSS <i>by definition</i> - a less technical prototyper person can give you their code (perhaps even generated code from some wysiwig monstrosity) and you can refactor over it to remove redundancy, enforce conventions etc using the special SASS sauce. The SASS syntax does not.<p>A HTML file, likewise, is already an ERB file. HAML is &#x27;backwards compatible&#x27; with ERB/plain HTML, so far as I recall, but mixing the two syntaxes is very, very ugly and a dreadful idea, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to mix the two in similar template languages (Jade etc).<p>Point is: there is a human factor involved in picking shinier toys. I like HAML/Jade type templates, and Coffeescript for that matter, but I am far more comfortable using them on small teams or solo projects.",1422618644

That &#x27;do&#x27; keyword up there indicates the start of a simple DSL. The DSL goes like this, every line is the beginning of a lambda. And the result of each lambda evaluation is passed into the next lambda.<p>So you get a sort of cascading scope of lambdas where the result of each lambda is available passed into the next. Each lambda depends on the evaluation of the previous one. Normally in Haskell functions are executed lazily, this structure forces the sequential evaluation.<p>So what are these cd, mkdir, output etc functions? They return an object with a specific type called &#x27;IO&#x27;. This type is monadic, but that&#x27;s irrelevant for now. Haskell as you know has no side effects in the language itself. The IO type basically is a command pattern, it says &quot;execute this I/O with these parameters&quot;.<p>The monadic aspect of IO makes it so that at the end the commands will have accumulated in a list, of which you can get an item if you give it the results of the previous item. So that&#x27;s what the main function returns, a list of commands with some lazily evaluated Haskell code in between them. Now comes the side effect part. The Haskell runtime system iterates over the list of commands and executes them. The result of each command is used to get the next command in the list.<p>So that&#x27;s the core of the magic trick of monadic I/O, you make a lazy list of I/O commands, and have something external to the language execute those I/O commands, giving the results back to the language to get the next I/O command to execute.",1422617503

Earlier companies sold you products like Microsoft Windows, Coca-Cola and Apple Macintoshes. Advertising paradigms like television advertising, radio, newspapers while really nice, had a &quot;last-mile-connectivity&quot; problem - you never really knew how you got your customer - through TV, radio? I do understand Nielsen and other ratings companies and some TV analytics historically try to ameliorate this, but the internet has been the greatest driving force in the last few years.
Google and Facebook etc. and internet driven content engines have all traded eyeballs for content or products. As a result, the intent to improve advertising for the eyeballs (since presumably the eyeball count has a theoretical upper bound) has become the force du jour.
Hence the ability to identify stuff was there, except for the machine learning part which has grown up from academia tremendously. It is just that now we have the intent to use all this to identify and collect patterns from all sorts of data.

Anyway...<p>I would do without JavaScript&#x27;s {} () and ; or Ruby&#x27;s end (which bugged me a lot 10 years ago) but unfortunately that easier syntax is offset by the too many times it came biting me with nasty bugs after I cut and pasted code around during refactoring.

Most people I see writing Go code seem to be writing <i>programs</i>, a piece of code that performs a specific function for a user.  In those cases, you very often know exactly the domain types, and Go&#x27;s type system is perfectly adequate there.<p>Other programmers write <i>libraries</i>, functionality that is meant to be used by other programmers to build their code upon.  In this case, you rarely know the context in which a user of your library will use it, therefore you cannot really make any decision about types.  This is a big reason why people like having parametric polymorphism.<p>The constant arguments that we see online probably comes from people writing programs and people writing libraries arguing with one another without understanding the context in which the other writes code.",1422616965

Sometimes even longer than JS. This is such a huge drawback, and even if there is coffeelint, for teams, this is deadly.<p>A lot of devs need to read a fair amount of foreign code. Even worse a lot of coffeescript writers also need to read and understand a lot of JS code.<p>Understanding and reading YOUR code slightly faster gets mitigated by having longer to understand foreign code.<p>While some JS purists fail to see that Coffeescript has some benefits, CS people also underestimate how &quot;quickly&quot; you can understand JS code, if you&#x27;re experienced. It&#x27;s all about what your brain is trained to do.<p>In my opinion, with ES6, I would argue for most people (ceteris paribus) it just makes sense to read and write JS exlusively, if you want to maximize output-productivity of a full, practical project.<p>Shaving off a couple of seconds &quot;understand-time&quot; of your personal, well written CS vs well written JS will just not compensate other things that will take you longer to do with CS.",1422616056

Even with a QA team, we&#x27;re suffering with product quality which I&#x27;m attributing to our CEO&#x27;s desire to add new features instead of fixing the core. As a designer, it&#x27;s not even that I care about getting everything to 100% perfection - I&#x27;d settle for 70% at this stage.<p>For example, we allow managers to access Timesheets for when their hourly/shift employees worked. Users have reported severe issues with the current implementation. We&#x27;ve designed a new version that replicates the current functionality but includes some new features.<p>I&#x27;m in the camp of wanting to rebuild the current version, removing the things that users hate now, then add the new, &quot;delight&quot; features later on. CEO disagrees & wants to build the new features with the rationale that &quot;current version is functional so new features will have the most value&quot;.<p>This is just one specific example, but it&#x27;s a pattern within our development process. As such, we&#x27;ve ended up with several sections of our app that even members of our team just don&#x27;t want to look at because they&#x27;re so janky (i.e. they were released out of MVP mentality & then never polished). I feel like for every new feature we add, we end up with 150 new bug tickets filed in PT that I have to prioritize. Can&#x27;t we just take our 3 core features, make them 95% effective & then move onto everything else? I totally understand that Investors like new features, but they like paying users more & people are paying for these 3 core features. Am I thinking about this in the wrong way?<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1422615823

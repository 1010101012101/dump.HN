1013577,comment,1013577,991007,0,0,Blend,,,"Perl has great potential. The reason Rails and other newer languages are getting attention is solely because they're new. Rails is easier to start programming in by people who'll never understand the difference between a constant and a variable in their life. Other languages are invisible to them.<p>Does that mean Rails is bad? No! Every language has its merits and demerits. It's easier for a programming to learn them all than fight for a single language.<p>Perl has its own strong points, just like any other language.<p>""No-one is building anything new with it today.""<p>Generalizations. So easy to make, and so imprecise nevertheless.",1261643382

1013566,comment,1012381,1012425,0,0,nikolayav,,,"It clicks with my intuition.<p>In one particular area of programming, competitive programming, productivity is easier to measure.<p>One might call Tomek Czaijka the Federer of algorithmic competitions. As of 1.5 yrs ago, he had made more than $130k off of TopCoder competitions [1]. Seeing as how he is still ranked 3rd, this figure might be outdated [2].<p>I can assure you the average TopCoder contestant who has competed over a comparable amount of time made way less than $130k/30 ~ $4300. Easily more than 30 times the productivity.<p>You can argue about how coding up toy programs compares to working on products. I suspect there is a strong correlation though.<p>As a point of reference, please consider Steve Newman, who co-wrote Writely which was subsequently acquired by Google and is today the word processor of Google Docs [3]. He must have made some money in the process and was also successful at topcoder.com [4].<p>That being said, I do knew similar people with astonishingly low ""product"" productivity.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.portfolio.com/careers/job-of-the-week/2008/07/06/Top-Coder-Tomek-Czajka/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.portfolio.com/careers/job-of-the-week/2008/07/06/...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=144400"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=14440...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.seattlepi.com/business/262443_googlewritely10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seattlepi.com/business/262443_googlewritely10.htm...</a><p>4. <a href=""http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=SimpleStats&c=coder_achievements&d1=statistics&d2=coderAchievements&cr=7445961"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=SimpleStats&c=coder_ac...</a>",1261642177

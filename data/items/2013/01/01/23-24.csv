4994568,comment,4992845,4993875,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Yes, I am aware. I was at a Usenix conference where Rob Pike presented a paper on it, back when it was a bright idea out of Bell Labs. It is the curse of brilliant people that they see too far into the future, get treated as crazy when they are most lucid and get respect when they are most bitter [1]. I was working for Sun Microsystems at the time and Sun was pursuing a strategy known as ""Distributed Objects Everywhere"" or (DOE) but insiders derisively called it ""Distributed Objects Practically Everywhere"" or DOPE, it was thinking about networks of 100 megabits with hundreds of machines on them. Another acquaintance of mine has a PDP 8/s this was a serial implementation of the PDP-8 architecture, Gordon Bell did that in the 70's well before serial interconnects made sense. It was a total failure, the rest of the world had yet to catch up. Both Microsoft and Google have invested in this space, neither have published a whole lot, every now and then you see something that lets you know that somebody is thinking along the same lines, trying to get to an answer. I suspect Jeff Bezos thinks similarly if his insistence on making everything an API inside Amazon was portrayed accurately.<p>The place where the world is catching up is that we have very fast networks in very dense compute. In the case of a cell phone you see a compute node which is a node in a web of nodes which are conspiring to provide a user experience. At some point that box under the table might have X units of compute, Y units of IO, and Z units of storage. It might be a spine which you can load up with different colored blocks to get the combination of points needed to activate a capability at an acceptable latency. If you can imagine a role playing game where your 'computer' can do certain things based on where you invested its 'skill points' that is a flavor of what I think will happen. The computers that do shipping, or store sales will have skill points in transactions, the computers that simulate explosions will have skill points in flops. People will argue whether or not the brick from Intel or the Brick from AMD/ARM really deserves a rating of 8 skill points in CRYPTO or not.<p>[1] I didn't get to work with Rob when I was at Google although I did hear him speak once and he didn't seem particularly bitter, so I don't consider him a good exemplar of the problem. Many brilliant people I've met over the years however have been lost to productive work because their bitterness at not being accepted early only has clouded their ability to enjoy the success their vision has seen since they espoused it.",1357084756

The 17th Amendment usurped the states rightful representation in the federal government and would be best if repealed. But it's harder to control the state governments if the federal government can't enforce mandates such as withholding money from states that refuse to pass or enforce laws. Those in favor of such centralized power are often unaware of their Authoritarian support. No state senator would pass such mandates laws and vote to limit their state governments if the senators had to answer to and were elected by the state legislatures. Each state can elect their senators as they see fit.",1357084696
4994562,comment,4993419,4993419,2,0,ctz,,,"HTTPS is certainly a better option than no HTTPS.  But we shouldn't forget that its trust model it is fundamentally and irrecoverably broken -- it has hundreds of single points of complete failure (to wit, DigiNotar and Comodo who both silently and completely broke HTTPS for the entire internet, for a time).<p>So, for the short term -- HTTPS is the best we have. In the medium term, the security model of HTTPS (and by implication, SPDY) must die, and CAs along with it.  DANE or Convergence seem like good replacements. Convergence certainly has the right trust model. DANE is perhaps more easy to migrate to, but suffers from being built on DNSSEC's unacceptably shitty crypto infrastructure.",1357084626

There are eight binary sequences of length 3:<p><pre><code>  000\n  001\n  010\n  011\n  100\n  101\n  110\n  111\n</code></pre>\n3 of those contain '00' but 4 of them '01'. Reason for the discrepancy is that one of those with '00' has 2 overlapping occurrences, but is counted only once. You get this as soon as overlap can occur, i.e. when the sequence to be found starts with x digits that it also ends with.<p>Of course, none of this matters, especially not when d << N, which it will be if N goes to infinity.<p>Also, the mathematical term is 'normal number' (<a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalNumber.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalNumber.html</a>), and we do not know whether pi is normal.",1357084569

Alice uses a simple, prepaid phone that only handles texts and calls. Bob has a smartphone.<p>Bob installs the Facebook app on his phone. The app wants permission to see his contacts, and he grants it. Maybe he's not paying attention, maybe there's a useful feature that needs his contacts, maybe the software asks the phone for permission, and the phone allows it without asking Bob. Whatever. Facebook now knows Alice's phone number.<p>When Alice gives Facebook her phone number to get a text (remember, that's all her phone can do), Facebook recognizes that it has seen this number before.

You can work on it as you see fit, then bring your tablet home.  On the way home, you still have access to everything, it's just running on a more limited platform.

4994494,comment,4990950,4993557,2,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"> ""People who watch porn are only learning how to make porn.""<p>That's a very narrow perspective. I can honestly say I have never felt like a porn actor (or director) in the bedroom because I watched porn as a teenager (to which I also attribute my ability to draw, FWIW...).<p>If there were magically a safe partner for everyone at all times, regardless or age or circumstance, I have no doubt there would be less porn. But we don't live in one of those worlds, we live in an emotionally-wrought, often isolating one. Teenagers feel alone, yet it's also a time when the instincts and cravings are the strongest, the most out of control, and the least satiable. The type of flirting and friendships I can take for granted, are not even on the table for them. Teenagers are still cutting their teeth on their communication skills. They don't know how to cope with a lot of things, one being the deeply-rooted drive to procreate. Pursuing those feelings safely can be difficult. Masturbation is one way for them to explore their feelings in the _safety_ of their own room - to take control of their feelings - without resorting to extremely poor decisions (unwanted pregnancies, unhealthy relationships, getting tattoos that claim they will love someone forever when all they really wanted was to see them naked...). Would a real partner be better? Perhaps. Is that always the best option? No, and I think it's harmful to act as though it were. Everyone has genitals and the feelings that go with them, but for better or worse, society pretends young people don't. For lack of a better term, they are screwed; they are on their own: they get to figure things out, hopefully without ruining their life in other ways.<p>Some forms of experimentation are more dangerous than others, and watching porn is one of the least dangerous options available to young people to explore their feelings. Ignoring that (prohibition, for example) won't help. Assuming we emphasize the difference between fantasy and reality, porn can serve a person well over the years. In that spirit, I would much rather see a ""this film is fantasy, and does not necessarily reflect a healthy realtionship"" warning on porn, rather than all those copyright threats... It's pretty obvious what our priorities are.",1357083453

I've been in a ward before as a voluntary patient and based on that experience, I never want to be in such an environment again.

Of course, the police turn up at my parents home at 4am in the morning.. my parents don't need that drama and neither do I. If I was having a heart attack, they'd send an ambulance but instead they sick their dogs on you to drag you back.<p>It's like a jail - at least the public system is. I was also threatened to be scheduled again by a person part of the team who do a follow up after you are released because I refused to allow them to visit my home (I agreed to this just to get the fuck out of the hospital). Shortly after you're admitted, they sit you down with a psych, his intern or some student and 2 nurses, ask you a bunch of questions and while the others sit there and watch you like an exhibit. It's such a game, one can't pretend they are 100% well otherwise they know you're lying while on the other hand, you can't be truthful because then you know they're going to force you to stay. I have insight into my delusions and I know which ones are real and which are not.<p>I managed to talk them into letting me leave and thankfully avoided the poisonous, mind numbing shit they say I should take. In the event they would force me to stay, I already figured out a way to scale the wall and leave. Of course, you can imagine the drama that would proceed that, thank fuck it did not come to that but I will not take their medications.<p>The first time I was in voluntary, they put me on zyprexa (pretty sure these medications have caused me numerous health issues) and I got out a week later and stopped taking that rubbish but the 2nd time they forced me into the hospital. Now, I won't contact them again regardless of what I need, you're best to keep it all to yourself because these people will kill you, it might not be their intent but they are so biased by the fact you're in there as a patient that they feel they need to give you something regardless of the reality.<p>BTW - being scheduled stays on your medical record. So now in the event that I actually need some medical assistance, they'll look at my history, think ""oh he's been scheduled before, lets schedule him again!""

This can be good (lots of interesting new ideas) or bad (esoteric concepts that may not be so useful elsewhere) depending on your point of view.<p>Lua is a ""small"" language, it's very elegant, but tries to pare down the feature set as much as possible while remaining a practical and usable language.  Despite not being a lisp dialect, I'd say in many ways Lua <i>feels</i> similar to old-school minimalist dialects of scheme (before scheme started to ... grow), though in general Lua has more of a ""practical"" bent.

It seems they include the per seat royalties on the screenings by charging you extra if you see each new movie more than once, and by being able to control how many new releases they have each month.<p>The member price for extra viewings and guests is $7 a show, which is the normal price for small town theaters. The price for non-members is $16, which is exceptionally high and will likely dissuade almost all casual visitors. It seems to be a decoy price whose intent is not to sell at that point but to mask that $7 for member tickets is not a bargain, but a normal ticket price.",1357081822

The last issue was jointly resolved through some refinement of Aero, and the fact that the marginal resource cost became less significant once more powerful systems became available at cheaper costs.<p>The crux of the problem though, is that many people found under Vista that many of their devices quit working, their PC was slower, and they were getting pop-ups from UAC for basically everything that they clicked on.<p>Vista wasn't terrible per se, but it's negatives outweighed the positives for many people, and when you boil that result down to a binary value representing whether you think it was ""good"" or ""bad"", then the result is going to be ""bad"".",1357081638

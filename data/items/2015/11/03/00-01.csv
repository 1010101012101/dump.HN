10496625,comment,10495304,10495304,0,0,monkbroc,,,"Background: I used to be an automotive software engineer. I speak for\nmyself only here.<p>Whenever the topic of automotive software comes up on HN there are\ncomments alongs the lines of &quot;global variables bad&quot;, but not much\nconstrutive feedback.<p>I want to explain some of the tradeoffs that lead to the architecture\nused in automotive software to get a better discussion going with HN\nreaders about that architecture.<p>tl;dr Given the hardware restrictions, real-time requirements and\nmeasurement capabilities required in automotive software, shared global\nvariables without locks is a fast and safe way to share state between\ndifferent software components as long as each variable is only written\nin one place in the program.<p>The microprocessor has to run for 10+ years in a wide range of\ntemperatures and be dirt cheap, so you end up with specs like 180 MHz, 4\nMB of flash and 128 KB of RAM.<p>The program must run deterministicly with respect to memory. There is no\nmalloc/new in the code. All variables are statically allocated.<p>Because the physical world doesn&#x27;t pause, no code is allowed to block\nwhile waiting for resources, especially synchronization primitives like\nmutexes.<p>The software architecture is in 2 main parts: basic software\ncontaining the real-time OS and hardware drivers, and the\napplication layer which has the domain-specific code for controlling the\nengine, brakes, etc.<p>The basic software is implemented using usual C programming techniques.\nIt has an API provided by function calls and structs to hide\nimplementation details of each microcontroller.<p>The application software is where the programming model is different.<p>To understand why, you need to know where automotive software comes\nfrom and what it is trying to acheive.<p>Originally all controllers were mechanical: a valve opens proportionally\nto the vacuum in a part of the system. Then some controllers were\nimplemented in analog electronics: take multiple voltages, feed them\nthrough an op-amp and use the output to control a valve.<p>So automotive software reproduces this: get some inputs, compute the\nsame physical equations at a regular rate and generate outputs.<p>This is dataflow programming. Blocks of code have inputs and outputs.\nThey are executed at a fixed rate that depends on the physical phenomena\n(air flow changes fast, temperature changes slowly). Different blocks\nare conneceted together in a hierachical way to form subsystems.\nEncapsulation is acheived by viewing these blocks as black boxes: you\ndon&#x27;t need to care how the block works if you are only interested in\nknowing which inputs it uses and outputs it produces.<p>Here&#x27;s an example component to control a gizmo.<p>It might be implemented in a visual environment like Simulink by\nMathWorks, or it implemented by hand from a spec.<p><pre><code>  #include &quot;GizmoController_data.h&quot;\n  \n  void GizmoController_100ms() {\n    Gizmo_Gain = interpolate2d(Gizmo_Gain_MAP, EngineSpeed, CoolantTemp);\n  }\n  \n  void GizmoController_10ms() {\n    Gizmo_Error = Gizmo_PositionDesired - Gizmo_Position;\n    Gizmo_DutyCycle = limit(Gizmo_Gain * Gizmo_Error + Gizmo_Offset_VAL, 0, 100);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIt takes some inputs (EngineSpeed, CoolantTemp, Gizmo_PositionDesired,\nGizmo_Position), has some intermediate values (Gizmo_Error), and\noutputs (Gizmo_DutyCycle). Those are implemented as global variables. It\nalso uses some constants (Gizmo_Gain_MAP, Gizmo_Offset_VAL). It has 2\nprocesses, running every 100ms and 10ms. All this information would be\nspecified in an XML file.<p>The header GizmoController_data.h is auto-generated at compile time by a\ntool from the XML file mentioned above. It will contain global variable\ndefinitions for the inputs, intermediates and outputs with the\nappropriate volatile, const, static and extern storage classes/type\nqualifiers. This ensures that the compiler will enforce that inputs\ncan&#x27;t be written to, intermediate values are private to the component\nand outputs can be read by other modules.<p>Note that no explicit synchronization is needed to access inter-process\nvariables like Gizmo_Gain or inter-component variables like\nGizmo_Position.  It&#x27;s shared memory between 2 processes scheduled in OS\ntasks that can potentially interrupt each other, but since the write is\natomic and happens only in one place, there is no data race. This is\nhuge! Concurrent programming, without locks, with the best efficiency\npossible, using a simple technique anybody can understand: only one\nplace in the program is allowed to write to any global memory location.<p>Calibration is another aspect of automotive software. In most software\nthe constants either never change or can be set in some kind of\nconfiguration file. For an automotive controller, the value of constants\n(gains, offsets, limits, etc) depend on the vehicle so they must\nbe configurable at run time during development. This is implemented in\nthe C code by putting all constants in a memory area that is ROM in\nproduction units, but RAM in development units. The compiler enforces\nthat application software cannot change constants, but the basic\nsoftware includes code so that constants can be changed from the outside\nin development. This process is called calibration and is done by\ncalibration engineers who are usually not the ones who wrote the\nsoftware. Note that calibration can drastically affect the behavior of\nthe software. What would happen if Gizmo_Gain_MAP is set to all zeros?<p>Measurement of variables is essential to understanding what&#x27;s going on\ninside the embedded controller. Having all that state available in\nglobal variables makes it possible for the calibration tool request the\nvalue of any variable in the software at a fixed rate and display it in a\nvirtual oscilloscope.<p>The measurement and calibration tool needs to know how to access the\nvariables and constants. It uses a file that maps from names to\naddresses for a particular version of software. That file can easily be\ngenerated a compile time since all allocations are static.<p>Going back to the architecture of the application software, let&#x27;s look\nat where our gizmo controller fits.  It is not the only component needed\nto make the gizmo work. You also need components to calculate the gizmo\nposition from some external signal (let&#x27;s say an analog voltage), to\nroute the output signal to the powerstage driver on the PCB, to\ndetermine which position the gizmo should currently occupy. These would\nform the gizmo subsystem package.<p>When the supplier releases gizmo 2.0 (TM) they upgrade the input signal\nto be a PWM input instead of an analog input. Modularity in the software\nallows the software team to simply replace the gizmo position component\nwith one that reads a PWM instead of an analog voltage and keep the rest\nof the gizmo subsystem the same.  In the future, projects that use gizmo\n1.0 use one version of the gizmo subsystem and projects that use 2.0 use\nanother.<p>This is true at any level in the hierarchy: as long as the inputs and\noutputs are the same, a component or subystem package can be replaced by\nanother.<p>Version control in automotive software reflects this. Instead of having\none tree of versions and releases like a typical software project, each\ncomponent, subsystem package and software project has its own tree of\nversions. Each software project will reference the subsystem packages\nrequired for their engine type, vehicle platform, sensors and actuators,\netc. This is how code reuse is acheived.<p>Testing is a mix of simulation (the sensor/actuator is simulated in\nSimulink and connected to Simulink block diagram of the software\ncomponent), hardware-in-the-loop (a computer simulates the vehicle, but\nthe real electronic control unit is used) and vehicle testing.<p>Thanks for reading. I hope this improves your understanding of how\nautomotive software is structured.<p>I&#x27;m hoping the discussion will bring examples from other fields like\nrobotics, drones and aeronautics that have similar real-time\nrequirements on how they architect their software.",1446512154

I think they do get up to some weird, freaky stuff in the holodeck, but like the toilets, it&#x27;s one of those facets of Star Trek life that can only exist offscreen.<p>Why do the holodeck doors[0] look like they have massive locking mechanisms? The holodeck is apparently one of the most advanced pieces of technology in Starfleet, a system of such vast complexity it can be create sentient life on command, and simulate the experience of entire worlds down to the atomic level. Why would such a system have what appears to be a peripheral role on the ship, serving as little more than entertainment, and why is it apparently locked up tighter than even the bridge?<p>It&#x27;s implied that humans for the most part have evolved beyond beyond base desires like greed and hatred, but this is rarely backed up by any of the series. But what if, among Federation society, displays of &quot;unevolved&quot; human behavior are generally forbidden or frowned upon outside of a controlled environment like the holodeck?<p>Whatever happens in the holodeck, stays in the holodeck (except when it doesn&#x27;t) thoroughly locked away out of sight and out of mind. It acts as a release mechanism for humanity&#x27;s atavistic pleasure seeking side, but humans can&#x27;t admit that it plays as central a role in their society as it must. We catch glimpses of this now and then from Barclay, or the one time Geordi&#x27;s secret hologram girlfriend was discovered by the woman it was based on, but for the most part the humans maintain the pretense that that part of their psyche no longer exists.<p>Part of the reason for this subterfuge (that I&#x27;m concocting and that isn&#x27;t canon but should be) might be that the Federation was started and run by humans, a species which is, as interstellar societies go, still practically children. Anyone spending time being tutored in civilization by the condescending (per Enterprise) Vulcans, the first alien species Humans encounter and the one that forms, if even subconsciously, their template for what &quot;aliens&quot; actually are, might have developed a deep species-level cultural cringe and a desire to appear more &quot;evolved&quot; to other species.<p>[0]<a href=""http://api.ning.com/files/2bmZ7rAoYlF22iZQvOguNf5lHJktmIBVkrlwgxOdU5AsRc4fLTtyZGhXWuc1WVz3hYRRRcL9sHlBzodXilLIGMFqejzkp9MO/holodeck_doorgalaxy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.ning.com/files/2bmZ7rAoYlF22iZQvOguNf5lHJktmIBVkr...</a>",1446512042

From wikipedia: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide</a><p>> The role that gender plays as a risk factor for suicide has been studied extensively. While females tend to show higher rates of reported nonfatal suicidal behavior and suicide ideation, males have a much higher rate of completed suicides.[2][7] However, a 2009 study tends to show little to no difference in suicidal ideation between men and women.[7] A 2008 study of suicide attempts by gender found that females have a higher rate of attempted suicide than males earlier in life, and that this rate decreases with age.[8] For males, the rate of attempted suicide remains fairly constant when controlled for age. Males and females also tend to differ in their methods of suicide and responses to suicidal feelings.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter which way you slice it, or which figure you believe/find more reputable, there is no stat that shows a 3 to one difference in attempts.

The declarative style of specifying a UI still has considerable potential as a way of composing manageable components, we just need a scalable way of decomposing the overall design to match, and it seems for now that means smaller-scale components need to be aware of their own concerns in some cases.",1446511933

When the author asks, &quot;How can the same sorts of simple equations keep appearing at every scale of nature that we look for them?&quot;, my (perhaps simplistic) answer is that if chaos were to entirely characterize a given scale, that scale would be too remote from ours to be observable.

And still somehow the market seems to be able to assign a value to those stocks.<p>I think that one way of interpreting this is that - just like with start-up valuations - as long as you&#x27;re growing / adapting / investing dividends are out of the question and the value is mostly based on the story and the dream. Turnover and other numbers are useful but ultimately not as useful as money returned to investors (otherwise, why invest at all?). But once the moment of dividend arrives (and growth / investment) have stopped and the company is now in its middle age that those dividends will be the marker used to re-calibrate the value of the stock. Dividends are a lot easier to use as an input into a formula than dreams and stories which are just repackaged hope.<p>That&#x27;s one reason why I find it nearly impossible to put a hard number on the value of a start-up, it&#x27;s essentially asking for a crystal ball.",1446510012

We aim to find treatments for 100 of them in the next 10 years.<p>What you’ll do<p>Our biologists run cellular experiments, and our data scientists build models from cell data.<p>Engineering: The chief job of the engineering team is to extract data from cells and hand it to the data scientists quickly and reliably. As the engineering team’s second member, you’ll advance the automated cloud infrastructure, currently mainly in Go and running on EC2 and S3, to process and manage >1TB of new biological images per week, among other critical items.<p>Data science: As the second member of our data science team, you’ll collaborate with our biologists to guide our experimental design, improve the models that drive our analysis, and use our data answer questions that guide our scientific and technical strategy. We currently work mainly with the python scientific stack, including pandas and IPython, and making some use of such libraries as sklearn, while also building our own models for machine learning and statistical inference.<p>See the posts linked below for more details.<p>Logistics<p>We&#x27;re based in Research Park at the edge of the mountains overlooking Salt Lake City, Utah. Gorgeous hiking/running/biking is literally out our back door, and it&#x27;s half an hour to 5 top ski resorts. We offer competitive pay, health insurance, relocation assistance (working at the office is part of the deal), equity, an awesome team to work with, and the chance to impact the world in a massively positive way.<p>Apply<p>Data science post: <a href=""http://www.recursionpharma.com/senior-python-data-scientist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recursionpharma.com/senior-python-data-scientist....</a> Data science applications: datasci@recursionpharma.com<p>Software engineering post: <a href=""http://www.recursionpharma.com/senior-software-engineer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recursionpharma.com/senior-software-engineer.html</a>: Applications to engineering @recursionpharma.com.<p>See who we are: <a href=""http://www.recursionpharma.com/team"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recursionpharma.com/team</a>",1446509718

It has non-generic socket preopening (unlike UCSPI), its service classes are daemons, agents, XPC and Mach services. The latter two are OS X-specific and bound to IPC mechanisms no less, which is an odd taxonomy. Furthermore, agents (per-user/session daemons) are subdivided into four session types: pre-login, per-user, GUI session and non-GUI session. GUI and pre-login session types are specific to OS X&#x27;s Aqua and loginwindow, and an impedance mismatch anywhere else. Further, non-GUI session is related to how launchd starts sshd from a plist, which again is a rather odd taxonomy-related coupling. Further still, the process types (four of them) aren&#x27;t used as information for what readiness protocol or startup discipline to use, but are tightly coupled to scheduling policies and resource limits! These four process types make sense only within the context of a desktop system where you want priority scheduling and resource accounting to keep system responsiveness as events queue up, but are meaningless in the generic case. Then, launchd strictly limits you to a lazy loading startup discipline and does not have any formal ordering or proper service relationships (other than KeepAlive, <i>all</i> options of which are either prone to race conditions or too narrowly defined) and instead relies on daemons to resolve relationships cooperatively via IPC with all the problems of cooperative/uncoordinated protocol negotiations. Fine for a cathedral like OS X, unworkable anywhere else. This on top of system and service state being intertwined in the same critical paths of PID 1. The whole thing is a mess of layering violations. Let&#x27;s not ignore how the NextBSD developers had to break Mach thread and task semantics to port the API (as a kernel module, no less!) over to a monolithic Unix with which Mach does not properly overlap. Finally, a more minor cosmetic gripe is LaunchOnlyOnce being a key instead of a job type.<p>It&#x27;s an absolute catastrophe through and through.

Your understanding of this is probably strong enough that you can wield it in day-to-day usage, successfully employing it to build back-of-the-envelope estimate, etc. Yet how many of you actually know how to calculate a square root by hand?<p>I've been shown how to do it, but have never done it myself but for once or twice. I also know how to estimate it via via calculus and interpolation. But I don't know how to do it now, and I've not even done it enough times to have gotten an understanding of the workings of ""square root"" by way of repeated manual application of the mathematics.<p>So, how to explain the fact that I (and presumably you) are so comfortable in employing the concept?",1314305888

IMHO, making something as complex as web programming transparent requires a lot of knowledge transfer. Making web development <i>more easily accessible</i> would be a fitting description. The idea is not new - see Ruby on Rails, even though it takes a different approach.<p>There is a lot of transparency in web programming if you are willing to learn. Roy Fielding's dissertation comes to mind as well as the book ""RESTful Web Services"", RFC 2068, RFC 2616 and ECMA-262.

I of course lost mine in early grade 10. Best thing by far that happened to me.<p>I was always that the top of my class for mathematics, so I was usually pretty bored with the homework, but all of a sudden I thought of a new challenge: Do all the homework without any calculator whatsoever. Yes, even things like 3^4 + 5^(1/4). At first of course it was painful, but at least I was doing <i>something</i>. I had a much better understanding of actual graphing than anyone else as well, because I would boil the functions down to their key points and play with them until I saw what they did at infinity.<p>I ended up getting my calculator back in late grade 11 (funny story, I had to sub in for a math teacher at the last minute because there was a wave of sickness at the school, so I was teaching people one year younger than me) and I saw my trusty calculator on the desk in front of me (I had engraved my name with a knife). I picked up and said ""hey thanks, I've been looking for this.""<p>Since then I've always been able to do math in my head and it is unbelievably useful. When people say ""oh so that is log(800), what is that"" and I respond with ""roughly 2.9""* they are flabbergasted, but I know how the curves actually work, I haven't outsourced that knowledge to a machine.<p>Programming is great and we should have graphing calculators in some part of the math curriculum, but students should be able to do this type of math by hand/in their head.<p>*I checked this after answering it in my head and was mildly amused. Here was my thought process: log(1000) = 3, log(100) = 2 a log graph has a consistently degrading slope, but one that will still take you to infinity, so the last 200 units in the 100-1000 range will be worth less than the first 200 units. And since halfway there is roughly log(300) and we assume a kinda-semi linear path form there (rounding down because 800 is higher on the scale) it comes out to roughly 2.9.",1314303894

You gave an <i>implementation</i> difference between the two, but what is the conceptual difference?<p>Also, the implementation difference is just, well, an implementation detail.  If you need to worry about whether a value requires calculation or not, you are likely about to mess things up anyway.  Consider the following:<p><pre><code>    f = (a long calculation of some sort)

    main = do
      doStuffWith f
      doMoreStuffWith f
    </code></pre>
The compiler may or may not decide that the result of f should be cached, meaning that after the first evaluation of f, f will from then on <i>be</i> a plain value thunk.<p>Given that evaluation order in Haskell is complex (and something you should try to avoid thinking about as much as possible), this distinction does not make conceptual sense.<p>Further down in my program listing, there is:<p><pre><code>    bob = f
</code></pre>
Is bob a value, because it takes no parameter?  Is it a function because f happens to be a function?  Is it really a function but practically a value since f has already been evaluated?  Is f so trivial (5 + 2) that its result has already been evaluated and inlined by the compiler?<p>These questions can be answered, but they shouldn't.  Their answers are not obvious from the code, and also subject to compiler decisions.<p>Therefore, ""f = sum [1,2,3,4,5,6]"" and ""f = 21"" are completely conceptually equal.  The distinction is not important when you are programming.  It <i>may</i> be important from a performance perspective in some instances, but that is usually a sign that you should defer some code to C.",1314302809

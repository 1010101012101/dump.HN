I hear many stories of people using SQL databases with one big table with a key column and a value column.<p>The article also begs the question: Why not just use a filesystem for state storage? Two big issues: 1) It's not very good at creating/updating lots and lots of tiny files and, 2) aside from some clunky locking, it doesn't have any good concurrency control mechanism for concurrent access to data. This is where databases become valuable.<p>I build FoundationDB, a database that aims to decouple the storage substrate (which we are building as an ordered, ACID key-value store) from the data models and interfaces (which we are building with our community as open-source projects). Not to say that this solves all problems, but it does align, I think, with the author's way of thinking.",1363280257

They get a lot of cases in southern China, especially along the border with Myanmar.<p>So do the (South) Koreans.  They get a lot of malaria cases along the demilitarized zone, which has basically been left to return to a state of nature.

Also, China and Korea are lucky in that the prevailing form of malaria is Plasmodium vivax -- which actually used to be called ""benign tertian malaria.""

When I cashed it a week later, she got very upset with me, because she forgot about it and already slated the money for something else. My response was ""well, you gave me a check and I simply cashed it. I would have gladly paid for the extra stuff, if I knew that's what you wanted"". Her issue was that something unexpected happened with her money.<p>Long story short, a quick text with ""About to cash the vacation check you wrote"" would have saved us a fight.

People who enjoy their job, or for whom that job is the only thing to keep them from hitting bottom, do not  have an 'amazing potential' that will improve their lives to use elsewhere.<p>We think all the time about how to automate things, but rarely or never about how to make places for other people at the feast. When it comes to distribution of surpluses, we get all vague about ""progress."" Why are we are so specific and concrete and active on one side, and so vague on the other?<p>When something is automated, we are not allocating the excess production to letting people spend time with their kids (or whatever those people want to do with it). We are cutting positions, hiring temps without benefits, hiring cheaper contractors from elsewhere... and keeping the change.<p>Because the little people are not defined as really part of the company, but as supplies and tools for the company's operations. From interview to layoff, they are at best a necessary evil, held at arms' length. The only people who are really part of the company are the powerful ones, who allocate the increases to themselves because they had the vision and the capital and they are the only ones who deserve it. And assuming a just world, those who are excluded and may have trouble finding new jobs deserve what they're getting as well.<p>Good leadership is leadership of humans, and incorporates concern for the humans being led. Just having lots of capital and using it in any way that gives you profit is not leadership, it is merely ownership.<p>It's not bad to be wealthy, nor is it bad to grow the pie.

Contracts are of course important, but if the only way you can trust the other party is through a contract and don't feel secure without one, can you really be sure that you won't get screwed over because of a hole in the contract? Seems to be that in reality a contract is only as good as the word of the person behind it, and if you wouldn't simply take them on their word, you might reconsider doing business with them altogether.<p>This protocol highlights that you don't need 50 pages of documentation to agree on something and I like it because of that.",1363279880

Banks are very concerned about fraud; the problem is that they do not get enough fraud protection from digital cash to outweigh the cost, because they already have good fraud mitigation methods.  Why switch to a car that gets one more mile per gallon of fuel, when the cost of doing so would not be recouperated for decades?<p>""Offline transactions are vulnerable to double spends, but this is the case with every digital cash system.""<p>The difference is that a person can double-spend in Bitcoin over and over again, even if the double spending is detected at some point.  In Chaum's design, a person who double-spends is eventually ejected from the system, and so a person can only double spend until the double-spent money makes its way back to the bank.  A legal system is not strictly needed here; all it takes is the bank blacklisting cheaters.<p>""this is what the SHA2/DSA parts of Bitcoin do. Nobody can forge transactions""<p>One does not follow from the other.  SHA2 is a (hopefully) secure hash function.  DSA is a secure signature system.  People might still be able to forge transactions, due to some other property of the Bitcoin protocol that composes poorly with DSA/SHA2.  A transaction in Bitcoin is not merely a signed message; there is a protocol that is used to decide the validity of the transaction, and that protocol might be vulnerable to attack (and maybe vulnerable to attack <i>as a result</i> of using DSA, as opposed to some other signature system).  Without a formal proof of security for the entire transaction protocol, it is hard to say.<p>A simpler example might help to illustrate the point.  Imagine a system for telling employees that they have been fired that works as follows:  the boss signs and encrypts the letter ""F"" using his signing key and the target's encryption key.  It may appear that forging a firing notification is hard, because the signature marks it as authentic and the encryption designates the target (i.e. if you cannot open the message, then you were not fired).  However, it is possible for an employee who is fired to turn around and fire others by re-encrypting the message and signature -- which works <i>even if the signature and encryption systems used are secure</i>.<p>(This issue has been studied in the past; see e.g. <a href=""http://world.std.com/~dtd/sign_encrypt/sign_encrypt7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://world.std.com/~dtd/sign_encrypt/sign_encrypt7.html</a> or <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2008/440"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2008/440</a>)<p>""This is essentially a coordination problem (which database copy is authoritative?),""<p>What does ""authoritative"" actually mean in the absence of an authority?  Without a good definition, it is hard to actually say what a solution would have to look like.<p>""the novel problem that Bitcoin solved.""<p>The fact that Tuesday's fork could happen is pretty strong evidence that Bitcoin is not really a solution to the problem (assuming we even know what the problem actually is).  The fact that a double spending attack was made possible by the fork is a sign that Bitcoin is either (a) solving the wrong problem or (b) not solving the problem at all.<p>Even if we limit ourselves to considering only Sybil attacks, Bitcoin does not truly solve the problem.  Sybil attacks are still possible; the only difference is that now the attacker will need more CPU power (maybe; more sophisticated attacks are certainly conceivable).<p>""Bitcoin went for something that can be algorithmically enforced""<p>Except that it is not enforced (at least not under any well-understood definition of that word), it is based on this sort of thing:<p>""staking its outcome on the belief that NSA-level computing would both not dwarf the rest of the network""<p>In other words, it is assumed that the adversary could never accumulate as much computing power as all the Bitcoin users combined have accumulated.  This is a pretty bad assumption to make, since it fails under any number of entirely plausible circumstances.  NSA-level computing is a complete mystery to the outside world; maybe they are using computing technology nobody else has, that works substantially more efficiently.  How do you know your adversary does not have such systems?  Every so often, Bitcoin ""miners"" switch to some faster technology for that task; is an adversary who invents a new technology for this really so hard to believe?<p>""double spends would be detected and could be somehow mitigated down the line""<p>What exactly can be done to ""mitigate"" double spending in Bitcoin?  There is no system for denying access to the network.  An attacker who double-spends Bitcoin could keep coming back and could keep double-spending.  In Chaum's system, double-spending carries the cost of losing one's access to the system; with Bitcoin, it carries no cost at all (one might just sell the equipment used for the attack, and so one only really needs sufficient capital or credit to procure the equipment in the first place).",1363279401

The biggest issue with our clients is that they will always argue how long things will take. One of our large clients has a SEO guy in one of their offices that has ""11 years web experience"" (despite not programming professionally for the best part of three years, and seemingly knowing very little about programming or how the Internet works) and he will frequently argue every small cost. We quoted two hours to modify a form used across eleven country-specific sites for one specific use case on a single site, and he went crazy, stating that it'd take him ""twenty seconds in PHP"". A bit of Googling shows that this guy hacks a bit of PHP in his spare time, but can't code for shit, and given his position at the company it's not really up to him to dictate price.<p>Anyway, the only way to give a valid estimate is to break down the task as much as you possibly can and to assign risk to each small task. Build a spreadsheet and break down every task into the smallest possible unit, and assign a risk rating to it. Any tasks that are high risk should be estimated as a range, rather than a fixed time. Even with this advice you'll still get things wrong, but it's impossible not to. It's the nature of estimating.<p>The best advice I can give you is to stick to your guns and estimate for how long it will take YOU to do a task. If people still argue, then tough. As rightly pointed out by adios, more experienced devs/pm's will happily overestimate and will fight their corner to say that this is how long a task takes. If you are honest with yourself on how long a task will take then you will find it much easier to stick to your guns when someone complaints that ""an easy task"" shouldn't take as long as you've said.",1363279043

I'm shipping a Fusion provider and open source AWS and RackSpace provider, but the interface itself is completely open source and documented, meaning anyone can add their own providers: <a href=""http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/providers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/providers.html</a><p>And the provider API was introduced while retaining full compatibility for stock Vagrant 1.0.x installs. I'm really proud of that achievement. Vagrant 1.1 is a drop-in replacement for many organizations.<p>Vagrant 1.1 is already in use in production at many large organizations, the biggest of which at the moment may be Yammer. The QA process for 1.1 was actually done by shipping to the big companies first. That was quite an experience, but I think that will result in a stable 1.1 experience for the masses.<p>Anyways, I'm here to answer any questions if you have them.",1363278825

I imagine you guys were shooting for the fewest words possible in deciding to go with the 'X for Y' approach as you did here. However, ""X for Y"" is a stylistic device that employs an analogy, and when the analogy is not based on the form or function of a thing, it gets easily confused.<p>Think of other products that use the 'X for Y' device--for example, a service that markets itself as 'Facebook for Sex'. The nearly automatic connection potential users are going to make is that this service is going to have certain obvious and well-known features of Facebook--like connecting with other users, building up a list of 'friends', etc. Now, if that service was, instead, a news feed of stories about sexual subjects, I think the users would be rightly confused by the analogy not being correct. Here, they'd have been better suited using the 'Facebook-like news feed for sexual content', or something more apt. The same could be said if the service was 'Google for Philosophy'--someone is going to automatically expect a philosophy search engine, not a pair of wearable eyeglasses that help you connect your everyday experiences to greater philosophical questions.<p>Perhaps you'd be better served with something along the lines of ""Dropbox ease-of-use for WiFi passwords"", or ""Dropbox-style management of WiFi passwords"". Here you're able to invoke the actual Dropbox <i>feature</i> your sample pool was connecting to that is not communicated clearly with the original wording.<p>Also, the only reason I think it's worth your attention is that you're actually having to <i>explain the analogy</i> multiple times to commenters here beside me. That's as strong an indication you can get that the analogy isn't working. You shouldn't ever have to explain what your marketing message means to your potential users.<p>Again, I think it's a great-looking product. Very well designed and executed, and the interaction simplicity is the <i>real</i> killer here (as you're obviously trying to communicate).",1363276852

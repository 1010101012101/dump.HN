I ultimately don't care how I'll be remembered since I'll be dead, but life itself is much more fun when you aren't hated while living it, at least not by too many people. Also, for those people with a conscience, just the personal knowledge that one's success is ""based on a lie"" might well be enough to sour the flavor of that success.<p>From what I've read, there's no evidence that Katz drank himself to death because he was overwrought with guilt caused by ""stealing"" ARC. I feel that if someone takes an existing program and re-writes it entirely in a more difficult language and creates very tangible improvements to it, it's not simple theft. Almost nothing is that black and white.<p>Katz was, apparently, a guy with no friends who spent most of his time with strippers. I would probably drink a lot, too.",1223106526

323391,comment,323081,323081,0,0,jhancock,,,"Most web apps will never reach the level of scale that cannot be handled by a well coded app with well managed centralized atomic data stores (RDBs being the most prevalent).<p>If you are building something with tons of content (video, images, pages that rarely change) you won't store this in an RBD, but your other data can certainly be managed well with one.<p>I've seen lots of poorly written apps which in turn have severe RDB bottlenecks.  But this doesn't mean the RDB itself needs to go away.  It you need atomic commits (and most apps do for some aspects of the app), an RDB is a good choice.<p>Besides, Oracle isn't even on the radar of most web apps; which go with MySQL or PostgreSQL.  This article is mostly gibberish.",1223104943

323389,comment,322630,322630,0,0,richardw,,,"Definitely. Note that many great coders are rushing into web apps, by default. It's the obvious thing to do and you can get a result out a lot faster than a well-designed app that requires installation, licensing, help files, hassling with different operating system flavours.<p>Which is why it's great. If you're willing to put in the time to make an app really good, then you can do really well.<p>It is a momentum game. It can take a while to build up enough steam. Subbing to a web app is very easy. Convincing someone to fork over their cash to a download, is generally tougher. But you only need a couple of percent to do that, to do okay.<p>I'm kinda going to be doing both. I have a downloadable app and I'm extending it with Google App Engine to provide some online features.",1223104765

Gemalto say:<p>- &quot;The risk of the data being intercepted as it was shared with our customers was greatly reduced with the generalization of highly secure exchange processes that we had put in place well before 2010.&quot;<p>- &quot;The report... also states that when operators used secure data exchange methods the interception technique did not work.&quot;<p>- &quot;Gemalto has never sold SIM cards to four of the twelve operators listed in the documents, in particular to the Somali carrier where a reported 300,000 keys were stolen.&quot;<p>- &quot;A list claiming to represent the locations of our personalization centers shows SIM card personalization centers in Japan, Colombia and Italy.

At least 30%, and more commonly 50% in SV/SF, of your company&#x27;s salary compensation goes out to residential shelter payments. That&#x27;s the low-hanging fruit to address if you want to reduce employee salaries.<p>Especially for a startup in like a stealth stage where the initial talent pool is already selected, and you don&#x27;t really need all the touted soft benefits of the SV talent ecosystem when you are head-down in secretive development, it&#x27;s advantageous to stay out of the high living expense metro areas. Living in flyover country during that period with the fully-communicated intent to the team that you will move to SV/high-COL-metro-area once you reach a specific level of financial success with specific commensurate salary adjustments for them, yields 15%+ salary cost savings from residential shelter cost differentials alone (plus other cost of living adjustments on top of that), and lets your initial employees plan ahead life events.<p>Now that startups are increasingly tapping the Millenial generation cohort for their talent, who statistically are already more indebted at their stage of life than previous generations, starting up in a very low cost of living area can be a bigger selling point for recruiting.",1424857737

We need better UIs, and we also need many infrastructure improvements. I have not looked at the protocol itself - but it being flexible and having too many options is not really a problem - it is needed for the other layers built upon it to have space for experimentation. But the PGP related libs are really not good. I had once an idea for a Web of Trust related website - and I found out that there is no way to for example verify a signature without loading a full key-ring, that is loading all unrelated keys into the memory just to build the data structure used by the library. This is just one case - but it supports the thesis that the libs are a fossil from the last century.

Or are they just given a series of user interactions required to make the computer do what they want? Couldn&#x27;t we do this with secure communications software? I don&#x27;t need to know why a certain crypto method is recommended, for example, if I know that a trusted party recommends it (say - Edward Snowden and Jacob Appelbaum).<p>We could have an open source crypto program with a set of basic modes for use. Maybe &quot;mode 3&quot; is good for basic interaction, while &quot;mode 5&quot; is recommended for whistleblowers but requires another step in the physical world, while modes 1 and 2 are deprecated because they were discovered to be vulnerable or weak.<p>The above is stuff a regular person can understand. Do they need to know how these modes work? Well, they need to know what input is required, but they don&#x27;t really need to know how it works behind the scenes if they trust someone else to recommend the basic modes. Then it must certainly be possible to write software that walked a user through how to complete the required information. It could say &quot;plug in your secure USB key now&quot;, then &quot;type in your passphrase&quot; and then &quot;remove USB key to continue&quot;.<p>Really, I think engineers have a hard time seeing how easy we could make things.

I rather risk to decline ten good candidates instead of hiring one wrong one. Hiring not fitting people will cost the company so much time and money that a expensive hiring process is justified. Question is which hiring process leads to good fits only but this is a different discussion.",1424855302

If it&#x27;s wobbly, or springy, my instinct is that it&#x27;s less controllable and that I need to concentrate more. Intuitively I feel (i.e. I haven&#x27;t done any research on this) that if something is unstable I need to put more neurons and metal effort into controlling it.<p>If I&#x27;m dragging something then I expect it to move directly as I drag it. I think that&#x27;s something built into human brain, or learned and calibrated at a very early age as we learn to manipulate objects. So if I continuously transform the origin to the location of my finger at any given time, during a drag, the subject of my drag should move.<p>- The four first examples (&#x27;rope effect&#x27; , &#x27;swipe off stack&#x27;, &#x27;2d waggle&#x27;, &#x27;3d waggle&#x27;) all involve expressing state changes in terms of movement.<p>- I don&#x27;t know what the rope effect is for except to look cute. But it feels &#x27;unstable&#x27; as above.<p>- I would much rather see a &#x27;dismiss&#x27; button to get rid of something, and for it to disappear, than to have to swipe it away and process seeing it move with a &#x27;swipe off stack&#x27;.<p>- I would rather an object did directly what I told it than do a 2d or 3d waggle.<p>- &#x27;Compose modal&#x27; makes the new modal box slide on screen rather than just appear.<p>etc etc. I don&#x27;t want to go through every example, but these are (mostly) all introducing movement when I&#x27;d rather not have to process it.<p>You probably like them. I don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the point. You can argue about skeumorphism, flat, responsive design etc quite harmlessly. They matter, but they don&#x27;t actively exclude people.<p>But I think this is something that, like colour schemes, should be researched properly and not subject to the whims of a designer. I&#x27;m sure plenty of designers at one point in history have said &#x27;we&#x27;ll make it red on green, screw the colour blind people&#x27;. Now we know better.

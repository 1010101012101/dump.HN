8559317,comment,8557056,8559125,0,0,6stringmerc,,,"From my personal interaction with PhDs, basically you have to leave the profession. I&#x27;m not kidding. I wish I was. Eventually you&#x27;ll find a job that may be somewhat related to your interests, in &quot;industry&quot; as it&#x27;s called, or you&#x27;ll have to start out in the field where there actually are jobs for STEM graduates: Teaching.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;ve watched the cheapening happen for the past 15 years, and at first it was schadenfreude. Me, a person with a liberal arts degree, was having a really hard time getting my career going, getting a living wage - and even with a Masters, 10 years of solid work experience, references, technology skills and no piercings, tattoos or felonies. Basically I&#x27;m a textbook employee on paper, and it still took me something like 200 applications to &quot;earn&quot; my first career gig.<p>All the while, people in STEM put me down for having a useless degree. Well, after watching the 2000s tech bubble pop, watching H1-Bs come in and drive down the wage faster than 50 somethings trying to take any job they can just to keep up with their lifestyle (and thereby rob a 20 something of the chance to start gaining the requisite experience), I no longer take solace in how hard it is to be in STEM. It&#x27;s a family thing now, but fortunately, my experience and my &quot;take no bullshit, this is fucking business&quot; attitude toward employment is very helpful.<p>I am a creative and intellectual mercenary. I fight for myself. I did not choose this path.",1415138326

8559297,comment,8558740,8558740,0,0,luu,,,"The claim:<p>“Most notably, it does appear that strong typing is modestly better than weak typing, and among functional languages, static typing is also somewhat better than dynamic typing. We also find that functional languages are somewhat better than procedural languages.”<p>But how did they determine that?<p>The authors looked at the 50 most starred repos on github, for each of the 20 most popular languages plus typescript (minus CSS, shell, and vim). For each of these projects, they looked at the languages used  (e.g., projects that aren’t primarily javascript often have some javascript).<p>They then looked at commit/PR logs to determine figure out how many bugs there were for each language used. As far as I can tell, open issues with no associated fix don’t count towards the bug count. Only commits that are detected by their keyword search technique were counted.<p>After determining the number of bugs, the authors ran a regression, controlling for project age, number of developers, number of commits, and lines of code.<p>That gives them a table (covered in RQ1) that correlates language to defect rate. There are a number of logical leaps here that I’m somewhat skeptical of. I might believe them if the result is plausible, but a number of the results in their table are odd.<p>The table “shows” that Perl and Ruby are as reliable as each other and significantly more reliable than Erlang and Java (which are also equally reliable), which are significantly more reliable than Python, PHP, and C (which are similarly reliable), and that typescript is the safest language surveyed.<p>They then aggregate all of that data to get to their conclusion.<p>I find the data pretty interesting. There are lots of curious questions here, like why are there more defects in Erlang and Java than Perl and Ruby? The interpretation they seem to come to from their abstract and conclusion is that this intermediate data says something about the languages themselves and their properties. It strikes me as more likely that this data says something about community norms (or that it&#x27;s just noise), but they don’t really dig into that.<p>For example, if you applied this methodology to the hardware companies I’m familiar with , you’d find that Verilog is basically the worst language ever (perhaps true, but not for this reason). I remember hitting bug (and fix) #10k on a project. Was that because we have sloppy coders or a terrible language that caused a ton of bugs? No, we were just obsessive about finding bugs and documenting every fix. We had more verification people than designers (and unlike at a lot of software companies, test and verification folks are first class citizens), and the machines in our server farm spent the majority of their time generating and running tests (1000 machines at a 100 person company). You’ll find a lot of bugs if you run test software that’s more sophisticated than Quickcheck on 1000 machines for years on end.<p>If I had to guess, I would bet that Erlang is “more defect prone” than Perl and Ruby not because the language is defect prone, but because the culture is prone to finding defects. That’s something that would be super interesting to try to tease out of the data, but I don&#x27;t think that can be done just from github data.",1415138073

After I paid the $138 shipping (to Texas), a friend tipped me off to their FAQ page where they&#x27;re advertising free shipping for preorders. <a href=""http://www.standdesk.co/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.standdesk.co/faq.html</a> By my calculations, I paid an extra $58 for the privilege of funding them on the second day of their Kickstarter. Lucky me!<p>So, I emailed them and explained how burned I felt by the whole thing. They argued with me that preorders are <i>not</i> being given free shipping. So, I pointed them to the FAQ page. This was on October 15. As of November 4, 2014 at 3:10 PM CST, their FAQ page <i>still</i> says preorders will receive free shipping. If they&#x27;re not honoring that for preorders, I&#x27;d be super angry if I were trying to preorder the desk and got bait-and-switched into paying shipping when they&#x27;re clearly advertising otherwise. And, lo these three weeks later, the FAQ still tells me I paid an extra $58 for my desk that I paid for in May.<p>Beyond that, communication with these jokers has been spotty, spread across various social media channels. (It looks like they abandoned Twitter months ago. Friday and today were the company&#x27;s first activity on Facebook since May.) The Kickstarter page saw very little activity over the summer and then Steven Yu posted a long &quot;we&#x27;re sorry&quot; post explaining some of the unexpected things that happened to delay shipping and to affect the shipping costs. Every item in the list is something that would have been totally understandable if it had been shared as it was happening. Instead, the company chose to go radio silent. From my point of view, when I&#x27;ve sent someone more than $500 for a product that doesn&#x27;t exist yet, that radio silence leads quickly to that sinking feeling of having thrown away a bunch of money. Some honest communication about the situations would have just gone so far to not burning through whatever good will the Kickstarter backer community had toward them.<p>Luckily, it seems that this long nightmare is about to be over and desks are leaving their warehouse. On October 17, I was told via email that my desk was scheduled to arrive &quot;in 2 weeks&quot; and that they would get it processed and out to me &quot;as quickly as possible&quot;. Friday I emailed to ask about the status, and as you can guess, I haven&#x27;t heard anything back.<p>Overall, the experience with StandDesk has been frustrating and uncertain and after all this delay, they&#x27;re letting others like IKEA to catch up. For my part, I&#x27;ll be thrilled to receive my desk, but mostly just so I can never have to deal with this company again. With any luck, packaging and delivery will be good enough that they won&#x27;t have availed themselves of literally the last opportunity to vex me.",1415137376

Her other book is branded like a self-help book, and it&#x27;s still good though I imagine many won&#x27;t like the style.<p>Her theory hinges on the concept of a &#x27;declarative knowledge system&#x27; as a component of cognition, which could be described (in an over-simple manner) as &quot;beliefs are significant determinants of behavior.&quot; This structure is also at the heart of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which is the dominant paradigm for treating anxiety, depression, ocd, and others. It also works by correcting problematic beliefs in patients.<p>The belief in question in Dweck&#x27;s work, which has so much impact on people&#x27;s learning efficacy, is whether intelligence is changeable or not. If someone thinks it&#x27;s changeable, they work hard to change it, and value effort. If they think it&#x27;s something fixed that they&#x27;re born with, they hold out hope that they might be brilliant for as long as possible, trying to make sure they and others think that&#x27;s the case. You can imagine how this impacts people responses to failures in intellectual domains: if you think intelligence is changeable, you are glad to be given information on a weakness that you can now improve; if you think it&#x27;s fixed, you become scared and discouraged.<p>I think this article focuses on the praise aspect, because it&#x27;s easy to communicate the idea to lots of people; but the reason the type of praise matters is because one type or the other leads (on average) to the formation of one belief or another on the question of intelligence mutability. If you&#x27;re not a parent, but someone interested in being able to learn more effectively, the praise aspect is probably less relevant to you—but the books are good.<p>The thing to keep in mind though, is that the only way to reap the benefits of what she&#x27;s talking about is to understand that intelligence is changeable (to deeply believe it—that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s going to impact your behavior). Reading her books can help instill the idea—I&#x27;m still looking for other ways to prove it to myself and have had some success.",1415136958

However, it seems to me to be better to start from a simple base and add complexity in as necessary, then start from a complex base and try to achieve simplicity.<p>But let&#x27;s run with the idea of loading everything into some immutable in-memory data structure, just to see where it goes. So long as we write everything in Clojure we&#x27;re fine, but the moment we start hitting things adapted for the JVM, such as the CLJS compiler, we run into problems as you point out.<p>However, it&#x27;s not too hard to conceive of possible solutions. Let&#x27;s start with a simple, but naive way around it. We&#x27;ll take the files in memory, write them to a temporary directory, and then generate a CLJS compiler with a classpath pointing to that directory. When the compiler is done, we take the result and load it into memory again.<p>Again, this is solution that aims for simplicity rather than performance, but optimisations immediately suggest themselves. If the files exist on disk, we symlink them or point the classpath directly at them. If we don&#x27;t need the CLJS output file&#x27;s content, we can defer loading it into memory.",1415136910

If the gifted programs in your state are like the one I was enrolled in, then members had to have a 130+ IQ to be admitted.  There is the rub. Upon exiting school you suddenly and jarringly discover that not everyone else in the world has a 130+ IQ like the people you spent the past 8-10 years with, and things get very slow.  Even at places like Google and Facebook not everyone has a 130+ IQ.  The world is a boring and unchallenging place when you&#x27;re forced to go through it at school-zone speeds.<p>Some people, like me, have severe difficulties adjusting to this deceleration. I was in gifted programs from first until tenth grade. However, after college (tech Ivy), I spent almost a decade in low-paying and unchallenging jobs while wracked with depression.  Only a few years ago was I able to pull myself out of that hole.<p>The solution is to disband gifted programs.  The culture shock experienced by the members once the scaffolding is removed can be pretty severe.  It&#x27;s probably better to make the gifted kids understand that the other 96% of non-gifted people on earth with them are going to be around them all the time. They should learn to deal with it. If there&#x27;s any gifted education, it should be outside of normal schooling.",1415136198

Andersen&#x27;s heirs have had plenty of time to capitalize on the characters and scenarios involved in &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; between 1844 and whenever Disney first started work on <i>Frozen</i>. Andersen receives an &quot;inspired by&quot; credit on the film, though as far as I am aware, his family does not receive any royalties or other financial consideration.<p>Now, many people would argue that that&#x27;s perfectly fair. But they&#x27;d also argue that it&#x27;s hypocritical for Disney to profit from adapting public-domain properties, while lobbying the government to preserve <i>its own</i> IP well beyond the IP&#x27;s putative lifespan of exclusivity. It&#x27;ll be a hot day in Arendelle before a Disney princess enters the public domain.<p>Let&#x27;s look at a fascinating example: the story of Mickey Mouse, who first appeared in 1928.

Reactor Manager Tom Tuohy[10] donned full protective equipment and breathing apparatus and scaled the 80-foot ladder to the top of the reactor building, where he stood atop the reactor lid to examine the rear of the reactor, the discharge face. Here he reported a dull red luminescence visible, lighting up the void between the back of the reactor and the rear containment. Red hot fuel cartridges were glowing in the fuel channels on the discharge face. He returned to the reactor upper containment several times throughout the incident, at the height of which a fierce conflagration was raging from the discharge face and playing on the back of the reinforced concrete containment — concrete whose specifications required that it be kept below a certain temperature to prevent its disintegration and collapse.<p>Initial fire fighting attempts<p>Operators were unsure what to do about the fire. First they tried to blow the flames out by running the fans at maximum speed, but this fed the flames. Tom Hughes and his colleague had already created a fire break by ejecting some undamaged fuel cartridges from around the blaze, and Tom Tuohy suggested trying to eject some from the heart of the fire by bludgeoning the melted cartridges through the reactor and into the cooling pond behind it with scaffolding poles. This proved impossible and the fuel rods refused to budge, no matter how much force was applied. The poles were withdrawn with their ends red hot; one returned dripping molten metal. Hughes knew this had to be molten irradiated uranium, causing serious radiation problems on the charge hoist itself.&quot;<p>By association and contrast that brings Chernobyl where catastrophe resulted from experimentations/tests outside of the established [existing] SOPs.",1415135326

This could very well segue into a discussion about patents, because some of the same issues exist there.<p>Given enough funding, a team of capable engineers and a solid vision (both of which are present at Tesla and other companies) the expectation of results should be the norm, not the exception.  We, as engineers, are trained to solve problems using the scientific process.<p>To use battery packs as an example, there are probably thousands of engineering teams around the world who could design excellent battery packs that could withstand the rigors of automotive use.  Tesla (and others) don&#x27;t happen to have the only 12 engineers in the world who can do that.  The same could be said of motors, electronics, software, suspension systems, chassis systems, etc.<p>I --and this is just my own bias-- am not impressed by what I consider to have to be the normal result of posing a problem to a capable group of engineers.  That is to be expected.  If you can&#x27;t expect that out of engineers there&#x27;s something seriously flawed with the way we are trained.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a continuum of capabilities out there.  There is such a thing as lousy engineers with no imagination and a lack of understanding of reality despite years of schooling.  Hiring is important.  A company forming a substandard team will produce substandard results.<p>The patent segue is that there really isn&#x27;t a lot today that most of us would consider to be true invention.  Most everything being patented are implementations, which is a tragedy.<p>What is hard in the context of an organization, despite money and possibly vision is to execute on a consistent basis, keep focus on a reasonable mission  and do so on a timely manner and within a reasonable budget.  A good comparison of a polar opposite to a company like Tesla is just about any government-run organization where money is never a problem yet they fail to deliver consistently on even the simplest projects.<p>Tesla doesn&#x27;t walk on water, but they have been executing a vision in what appears to be a constant series of flawless moves.  They have good people who obviously work well together, they seem to know very well where they are going and, of course, they have the drive and funding to make it happen.  Larger car companies could very well have to try to push the same ideas forward while mired with unmotivated and inefficient teams that just can&#x27;t get anything done at the same time scale.  And then there&#x27;s the organizations themselves getting in their own way, AKA, &quot;The Innovators Dilemma&quot; [1].  There&#x27;s plenty of history on that last point.<p>To some extent Tesla doesn&#x27;t have to be a super organization, they just have to keep to their mission and they will outplay everyone else who is still failing through good management while trying to sell 5.25in drives because that&#x27;s what their customers tell them they want (a reference to the book).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business/dp/0062060244"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-B...</a>",1415135270

Would love to talk about this stuff.<p>>There&#x27;s loads of kids going to graduate school to become servants for mediocre, yet politically-connected scientists.<p>The first part is true, but the mediocre scientists aren&#x27;t necessarily politically-connected.  More often, they&#x27;re just <i>busy</i>, so consistently busy doing their own research and supervising their own students that one day some new and improved methodology, instrument, or statistical tool leaves them in the dust.  This happens because, frankly, nobody pays them to keep their methodology, instruments, and statistical tools up to date, and it&#x27;s not like anyone will refuse to publish their papers if <i>they</i> don&#x27;t keep up-to-date.  They get grants because they publish papers, and they publish papers because they keep doing experiments and/or proving theorems -- the fact that they <i>could</i> be learning more and quicker by working some other way isn&#x27;t built into any incentive structure except their personal hopes and dreams (which are the first thing any young scientist learns to repress).<p>There is <i>especially</i> no shortage of scientists in the sense that, simply put, there are not enough permanent jobs for the PhDs and post-docs we already train. <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd030909s.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd030909s.gif</a><p>>Then, once they have spent the X years and $Y in opportunity costs to get a PhD, they have to figure out a career for themselves. This is a bad, not a good, thing. It reduces early-stage career experimentation and encourages low-quality science.<p>This is quite true.  I find the advising structure in graduate school <i>strange</i> with respect to its stated purposes.  The definitional requirement of a PhD is that it be a large piece of original research (stereotypically, about three papers&#x27; worth) that charts the course for the young scientist&#x27;s early career.  The <i>best</i> PhD dissertations open up whole new subfields, and <i>those</i> are the young scientists who get the good jobs.  But how do we allocate labor to produce these &quot;brilliant new ideas&quot;?  Largely by assigning the graduate student to work on their adviser&#x27;s <i>existing</i> research program, which they can slowly transform into something at least partially their own depending on their level of supervision.<p>(The <i>worst</i> PhD dissertations are basically just longer MSc dissertations: fully supervised research work done in total peonage with little to no original input by the apprentice graduating to become a real scientist.)<p>>There are loads of theories and ideas in any given field about the way that things may be. What you need, as a minimum, is the ability to stick the course to figure out a way of testing those theories and ideas and do the (extraordinarily boring) legwork to get it done. I know a lot of scientists (physicists and mathematicians) and all of them are stubborn, but not particularly brilliant. 99% of physics and mathematics are made up of people who will do drudge work for years with very little recognition or reward. Very, very occasionally, one of them hits the jackpot. It&#x27;s not brilliance that defines a professional scientist; it&#x27;s a willingness to be bored and work weekends for very little compensation.<p><i>clap clap clap</i> <a href=""http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6odkq8jNo1qbolbn.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6odkq8jNo1qbolbn.gif</a><p>Absolutely, completely, entirely, 100% true.  The vast majority of professional science is legwork.  Theoreticians can spend plenty of time constructing models or proving theorems to <i>feel</i> brilliant, but ultimately, they <i>mostly</i> just do legwork as well.  Experimentalists and engineering researchers have to <i>actually do experiments</i> and <i>actually produce artifacts</i>.  Mind, many of us find even the drudgery and legwork plenty fascinating to set-up and do, but almost never so much that we&#x27;d object to your taking it away somehow.<p>Also mind: some scientists <i>are</i> brilliant.  They&#x27;re just not the mode, or even always the shining stars of the field, since professional scientists are mostly selected (and therefore optimized) for tenacity (being bored and working weekends for very little compensation) and consistency (producing 110% the desired results, from elementary school through grant applications).<p>I would add only one quality: a professional scientist is defined not only by religious devotion to doing loads and loads of legwork for little compensation, but also by an emotional ability to withstand being <i>constantly</i> graded, measured, and stack-ranked against everyone else in your field, in time periods ranging from each semester to every few years.  From the beginning of undergrad <i>through</i> tenure and <i>up until you move from doing research to mostly teaching or administrating</i>, you basically never stop having to pass yet another set of exams (each one calibrated to fail some percentage at the bottom, forcing them to find other careers) to continue doing your existing job or to receive a promotion that other skilled professionals would usually get by virtue of experience alone.<p>While I&#x27;ve heard that many decades ago, funding and positions were plentiful, and so the system was not nearly so burdensome as today, <i>now</i> I am always a little amazed that scientific advancement manages to happen <i>at all</i>, since almost everything a scientist does professionally is connected to keeping his job instead of actually <i>getting and sharing research results</i>.",1415134877

7112037,comment,7109345,7111739,2,0,jimktrains2,,,">If you philosophically reject all warfare, espionage, and law enforcement, then there is no legitimate reason for a government secret.<p>Law enforcement doesn&#x27;t need to be based on secrecy.  I never said you have to broadcast that you&#x27;re investigating someone, just that the information about who, how, and why you&#x27;re investigating someone be reasonably public (going through real courts to get warrants and such).<p>As for war, if we&#x27;re in a defensive war we can chat about not letting the army put their immediate plans up for all to see.<p>Ditto with the case about the Olympics in a sibling thread.  I see the usefulness in _short-term_, someone&#x27;s-life-is-in-danger (not because the state put them there), secrecy.<p>> That doesn&#x27;t address the problem the White House faced in the Cold War. Namely, how do you ensure the nuclear deterrent is credible even when lines of communication have broken down? If you rely on Shamir Secret Sharing, then retaliation would be impossible if the secret holders are unable to communicate with each other.<p>The basic idea would be to have redundancy in channel, location, mode, since we&#x27;re talking about a case in which the chain of command&#x27;s top has been ripped off leaving many higher-ranking officers at the top of the new chains. An attacker wouldn&#x27;t be able to take out all (all routes for all modes all over the US) of the communication network simultaneously, especially if we&#x27;re not talking about superbly massive bombings in which case there would/should be detection.<p>Also, to be credible, you&#x27;re assuming the US is telling other&#x27;s about their system (so that the USSR knows/will think that it can&#x27;t simply take out the president and there won&#x27;t be retaliation). Otherwise it&#x27;s all just based on speculation and in terms of deterrent doesn&#x27;t matter what the actual system is.<p>So instead of saying &quot;in a communications breakdown everyone does what they think is best, so someone is going to retaliate&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;there can&#x27;t be a communications breakdown because of redundancy in mode, route, and location; so in the event of a collapse of the chain of command, it can only collapse so far and hence retaliatory action is still possible.&quot;<p>This just seems better in practice as well.  There is the Dr. Strangelove example of someoene just taking power, and one can also imagine that someone innocently loses communication and assumes the worst.<p>> You&#x27;re shifting the meaning of &quot;worst-case scenario.&quot; I used the term to refer to a physical threat, external to the government, which the government is responsible for defending against. You&#x27;re using the term to refer to a pathology of the government itself. So, the scenario you envision is not the one to which I was referring.<p>Why must it be external, though.  Both you and I are concerned about how the government should operate in a manner that protects the populace; I&#x27;m just saying that from the populace&#x27;s POV, the government is/can be an external threat.  Look at Kiev right now.<p>Yes, there will be (exceptional) times when secrets are needed; I get that.  Those should be exceptions, and not the rule, as it feels like it is now.<p>I just think that erroring on the side of transparency, and not doing actions that would otherwise be limited by that transparency (e.g. covert operations) is the better option in terms of dealing with external _and_ internal threats than is secrecy.<p>Also, an ideal would be for emergency measures to simply flow from the normal operational measures.  In the nuke example, forcing some sub-set of commanders to agree that they&#x27;ve received orders to launch nukes (and by implication of participation agree with them and have verified them) before nukes could be launched.  The emergency situation is now simply that instead of confirming an order from above, they confirm that they all agree that the situation is such that they should launch.",1390517919

This is certainly often the case in things like web development, where dynamic languages dominate, but under the hood, Julia has relatively little in common with Python/Ruby/JS/PHP/etc, in terms of how it&#x27;s implemented or, especially, what it&#x27;s intended to do.",1390517887

First, what if Microsoft really does lose it in a big way (rather than just remaining stuff, boring and unimaginative)? Enterprises will really be on the hook to find replacements, and to create portable versions of all that documentation that&#x27;s in .doc and .docx format. Second, does &quot;the enterprise&quot; and &quot;the rest of the world&quot; divergence have any consequences?  The Sharepoint thing is a good example. Everybody else uses Apache, nginx or something, but corporations use Sharepoint because it lets them keep a thumb on their employees. Won&#x27;t any innovation made by The Rest of the World just pass them by? Will Sharepoint admins end up making the big bucks because there&#x27;s no easy to find, off-the-street source of those folks?",1390517883
7112032,comment,7110879,7110879,5,0,nlp,,,"Nobody seems to be talking about SMTP...<p>SMTP is the protocol that is used for basically all email, and it does not provide encryption.  There are versions of the protocol that DO, however they cannot be used in isolation.  Emails hop from source to destination via a bunch of SMTP relay servers, and since nearly all SMTP servers support the legacy protocol and do not support key exchange, encrypted SMTP traffic will bounce.<p>When you use gmail, your connection to Google is secure.  But if the recipient of your message is not @gmail.com, the message leaves Google&#x27;s servers in plain text over SMTP.  If the recipient is @gmail.com, the message stays inside the Google network.<p>The point is, all of our emails traverse the internet in plain text unless we use custom solutions (eg. PGP at both endpoints) or send emails within a network (eg. Gmail to Gmail).",1390517879

And, the folks comfortably in the middle don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re siding with the folks up top, either through inaction or through conscious choice to serve those interests (even if they&#x27;re only middle class by SF standards and have much more in common with poor folk than with the .1% that effectively own everything). This is why there&#x27;s so much anger. San Francisco has always been expensive and most regular folk there have always been renters. But, it&#x27;s becoming impossibly expensive for huge swaths of people and the hope of surviving in SF as anything other than a wealthy white (or Asian) male engineer is fading fast.<p>This article has some good ideas. People in the valley <i>should</i> get out of that echo chamber regularly and do something real in their community. Come up with something else to talk about now and then. But, I don&#x27;t think it will solve the underlying problem; lower and middle class people are realizing the world isn&#x27;t what they thought. The odds are simply stacked against poor folks in America (and stacked against escaping being poor), and they&#x27;re worst in places like San Francisco and NYC. The churn in wealth that is supposed to happen in a market economy <i>isn&#x27;t</i> happening anymore, if it ever did. It&#x27;s been locked down hard by a very few, and the rest of us are merely renters and debtors, with no real say in the system. And, the idea I see that &quot;they should just move&quot; is missing the point...this problem isn&#x27;t a San Francisco problem. It is nationwide, and San Francisco is just the canary. It&#x27;s happening in every major city in the country.",1390516987

But I think the real windfall to be gained from P2P lending is where the local alternatives are most expensive and inefficient.<p>For small loans to low-income people in developing countries (&quot;microfinance&quot;), the global average interest rate is about 40%.  It is not necessarily profiteering; their model is just incredibly inefficient.<p>Even zero-interest Kiva loans cost more than 30% on average to the borrower, simply because the local banks that manage the loans need to charge that much to cover their operating costs.<p>Zidisha bypasses all that by offering a do-it-yourself microfinance marketplace.  Our operating costs are roughly 5% of the value of the loans, versus the 40% or so that is traditional in this sector.

According to this article [1] from last year, Bayer was running a program that gave ~70% of Nexavar users a 90% discount from their in India market rate ($5500 USD monthly). The generic maker sells at $176 monthly, and per licensing fees, pays Bayer 6% of net sales.<p>Also, about the nature of the drug. It&#x27;s basically a treatment of last resort. The initial study that granted it FDA approval for in advanced liver cancer showed a 3-4 month increase in median survival time compared to placebo (remember, this is with cases that have exhausted other options). Further studies show some greater synergistic effects combined with other treatments. Also, in a study with a smaller population, and slightly different subtype of liver cancer showed an overall median survival time of 26 months (it&#x27;s unclear to me from reading the abstracts how the baseline conditions of the two trial&#x27;s patients compare, so it&#x27;s difficult to directly compare their results).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/bayer-to-appeal-against-indias-patent-ruling-on-nexavar/article4484568.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/bayer-to-appea...</a>",1390516091

We have methods such as Shamir Secret Sharing that would require multiple people to agree to something before being able to provide something to authorize a use of force.<p>That doesn&#x27;t address the problem the White House faced in the Cold War. Namely, how do you ensure the nuclear deterrent is credible even when lines of communication have broken down? If you rely on Shamir Secret Sharing, then retaliation would be impossible if the secret holders are unable to communicate with each other.<p>> Unless that &quot;hypothetical, worst-case scenario&quot; is the government going awry and surveying it&#x27;s entire populace and killing its citizens without going through any process set down by the constitution of said country. In that &quot;hypothetical, worst-case scenario&quot; is it really OK to be giving the government more power and leeway while decreasing the transparency?<p>You&#x27;re shifting the meaning of &quot;worst-case scenario.&quot; I used the term to refer to a <i>physical threat, external to the government, which the government is responsible for defending against.</i> You&#x27;re using the term to refer to a <i>pathology of the government itself.</i> So, the scenario you envision is not the one to which I was referring.",1390515667

Ultimately, there are a few different takes on solutions and different ones make more sense in certain situations. The IRL vending machine scenario outlined in the original article may make sense in some counter service places, but far less in a white tablecloth restaurant situation.<p>While on the surface it may seem like it is not a hard technical problem, it can be. Two approaches to solving the problem include writing middleware integrations for incumbent point of sale software (eg. TabbedOut) or write the point of sale software yourself (eg. Square). Both can have hurdles to overcome on the technical side as well as the human side.<p>So some of the obstacles in place are: is there an existing point of sale? Would the restaurant require something more powerful than an old school cash register? Who should be processing the credit cards? How quick does fund settlement take place? How much disruption of the normal business process is acceptable (fix things, but don’t make a server’s life more difficult)?<p>On another note, from the end of the article where Nick mentions that he would be happy paying an extra 10% tip, that seems like a nice gesture, but in practice that isn’t a common mindset from the consumer. When TabbedOut launched, there was a $0.99 service charge for tabs opened with the app. Overall, the concept of making the consumer pay for the service was not very well received.<p>We’re constantly working on improving our solution and would welcome any feedback. Oh, we’re also hiring engineers if this sounds like a problem anyone would like to help solve [careers@tabbedout.com].",1390515517

Apparently most don&#x27;t despite how invasive that would seem if that wasn&#x27;t the case to begin with. The real question is, how much would a government with this new order of consent, really need to know about you? Would they need an online ID assigned to a GPS location, or everything that Google has on you to perform their function?",1390515212

They&#x27;ve done some important work to unify the logins, but then they dilute the whole thing by making a second-rate Facebook clone and hoping everyone will flock to it.<p>Meanwhile though people are realizing that none of these companies really give a shit about your privacy, and even if they do, they don&#x27;t care enough to really protect it, so inevitably trust will be eroded over time as Facebook, Google and their younger brethren strip-mine the naive goodwill of consumers in search of the new shiny.

There was a wave of evictions before around &quot;Mission/Dolores&quot; which is immediately west of Mission Street, but the new ones are east of that street. This is a somewhat run-down neighborhood (compared to Dolores) where everyone speaks spanish and all business is (or was) conducted in spanish. The evictions amount to an attack on one of the last really cheap places to live in SF.<p>I&#x27;ve only been living here since 2011 but even since then a lot of businesses have been replaced with hipster coffee houses and bars, and a lot of triple deckers have changed hands and then mysteriously burned down. If you lose your apartment in this part of the city you will pay thousands more to get another one just like it, or you won&#x27;t make that kind of money and literally no longer be able to afford to live anywhere in the city you probably work in. As an example I took the cheapest place I could in 2011 at $1200/month for something about the size of the cube you work in, and I&#x27;m sure I am paying more than twice as much as my neighbor. The next cheapest place was $1650, and over by Dolores was about $2k. I look at apartment listings and there&#x27;s nothing studio sized in the area for less than $2500 now. If our place changed hands and burned I&#x27;d be inconvenienced and maybe have to cut back on comic books, but my neighbors would literally have to leave the city. It seems to me they have a legitimate gripe over having their neighborhood ripped out from underneath them, though I don&#x27;t know what they should do about it. They might start demanding the city intervene or build public housing, but the existing new apartment fees that go into a pool to build public housing either don&#x27;t get paid or just don&#x27;t get built.",1390515087

This sort of national policy issue, of course, often results in different countries coming up with differing laws.

And that (nothing particularly nefarious) is all that is involved in the United States negotiating with India about this issue.<p>I&#x27;m very glad that somebody is developing new medical treatments (both drugs and medical devices). All of that work is very expensive, and much of it results in products that never turn a profit. I can&#x27;t think of any social justice reason why my childhood best friend, a first-generation college graduate from a working class family, who now develops medical devices, should have to work for free. Nor can I think of any social justice reason why anyone who needs effective medical treatment should be without it, in general, but until new medical treatments are invented, wishing doesn&#x27;t make that so. India&#x27;s approach to compulsory licensing on non-negotiated terms for new treatments developed outside India may be very politically appealing in India, but it&#x27;s not completely clear that that is the best national policy for responding to the grave health problems[2] that still exist in India.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-21/merck-to-bristol-myers-face-more-threats-on-india-drug-patents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-21/merck-to-bristol...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-23/news/40134749_1_stop-tb-department-mario-raviglione-jmm-meeting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-23/news...</a><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303444204577460734274201756"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230344420...</a><p><a href=""http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Facing-the-Reality-of-Drug-Resistant-Tuberculosis-Challenges-and-Potential-Solutions-in-India.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Facing-the-Reality-of-Drug-R...</a><p><a href=""http://www.tbcindia.nic.in/pdfs/RNTCP%20Response%20DR%20TB%20in%20India%20-%20Jan%202012%20update.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tbcindia.nic.in/pdfs/RNTCP%20Response%20DR%20TB%2...</a><p>AFTER EDIT: I see some wild karma swings on this comment, so feel free to tell me what you really feel about this comment.

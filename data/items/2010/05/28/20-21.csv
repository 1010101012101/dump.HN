The point here isn't about putting a name on something for an ego boost, its about effectively managing my (hypothetical) money in a controlled and sustainable way over a longer period of time so it can be put into multiple causes, rather than dumping it all into someone's lap one day and saying 'go'. And by moving this hypothetical money into a 501(c), it puts the money to work over time while keeping it out of reach to blow on tempting luxuries. I stand behind this idea.",1275077063

1387490,comment,1385543,1385543,0,0,korch,,,"Isn't it a little <i>too convenient</i> that the Universe seems to prefer 3d for physical processes, and that almost any kind of phenomena we need to understand can be framed in a 3d model? Or is it us the whole time, unable to see beyond our own limitations? When we see grandiose contrivances in a film plot, we naturally suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the story. I think those of us who have learned university math and who think we understand higher dimension are doing likewise—telling ourselves a story so we don't have to walk out of the theater.<p>I don't think we consciously ""think"" in any dimensions above 3. Like all life, we are neurologically hardwired by default to think in 3d, since that's what has worked for the evolution of all life on Earth. As for formal math, I am no longer even sure there is a connection between the logical, axiomatic and cultural edifice we've built up and call ""mathematics"", and our day-to-day ""neural navigation software"" that allows each of us to get from point A to B on the surface of a rotating oblate rock tethered to a nuclear fireball that is hurtling through the infinite, continuous space we call the Universe. The map is not the territory. The mathematical deductions of our neural experience are not the same thing as the experience itself.<p>From all of the suggestions on Mathoverflow, almost all of them are variants on projecting higher dimensional objects onto 3d and 2d objects, then comparing all the different projections in a clever way to get a ""feel"" for how the higher dimensional object changes. Even this is completely non-intuitive, as our brain's visual apparatus is optimized to take in a total picture and immediately spot the biggest changes. i.e. there's a predator running at us from over there! That is afterall what eyeballs and visual perception evolved for! If we can't even see the whole visual field at once, but just slices of projections of it, then our finely tuned visual hardware is thwarted and unable to detect and piece together the ""shape"" of objects. This is why is say nobody can ""think"" higher than 3d—even if you are doing it, your brain is still imperceptibly and behind the scenes translating your logical construct into a 3d ""sensory"" construct.<p>With that said the best way I've come across for visualizing 4d objects is from complex analysis, where you can use color gradients to represent a dimension. It doesn't work so well going beyond 4d, but it's a great set of training wheels.\n<a href=""http://www.mai.liu.se/~halun/complex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mai.liu.se/~halun/complex/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.nucalc.com/ComplexFunctions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nucalc.com/ComplexFunctions.html</a>",1275076935

But the profs ideally want to teach stuff they think is important/interesting to people who want to learn it, and to them, the people taking the class <i>only</i> because it's required for the degree are sort of the least desirable students, while someone taking it <i>even though</i> they don't have to, because they actually think it's interesting, is great.",1275076878

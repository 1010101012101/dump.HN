Though been a long time since I checked that one out, though did on few systems and found it to be so.  But there again csh was also about then, distant memory in for many that one.<p>Also anything that will run script wise on bourne will run as is under korn.<p>Though you may well find that it is historical, which one a user picks shell wise.  People who started or worked a lot with Sun systems will be csh fans.  Old vets more inclided to bourne, though very few.  As for korn shell, that would be mostly down to AIX systems as that is the default upon them as with the other systems mentions, default wise.  Then for Linux you will find a bias towards bash.<p>Least that is what I have observed.<p>Though history does give us some intersting trends and the awk, perl, python transition and preference will also mostly be down to when somebody got into unix as a whole.  Again old school, awk.  Old, perl and not so long ago the python brigade.<p>But that is just a rule in thumb and more helpful in explaining why there is a solo perl script when everything else done in xyzzy type encounters.<p>As for OpenBSD, good choice, I prefer it due to the file system layout and more akin to old school unix unlike Linux which is `creative` more than not in choices, so feels less at home.<p>Still back in the early days we had AT&T and Berkly BSD flavours and with that the ps command, oh the fun and games.<p>But least thinks a little bit more common across flavours than before and yet still each has there own quirks.",1404471466

Arguably, if you&#x27;ve started out with RoR, then Node.js was a great improvement (dynamic typing with awesome speed). Then came Go, which solves many of the issues you tend to encounter with Node.js. So now, after it has reasonably matured, many people are pivoting to it. \nScala, while having a rather &quot;bloated&quot; core library (i.e. quite exhaustive), already does most that Go does (i.e. an Actor is reasonably close to a goroutine etc.) and has an awesome type system.

Say if I make a reservation you charge my credit card with 20$ (or whatever). If I cancel (it does happen) up to three hours (or 6, or 24, or whatever) in advance the charge is reversed and the transaction is at no cost to me.<p>If I show up the 20$ are fully credited and deducted from the bill.<p>This would certainly only work for restaurants that can generate the necessary demand. Then again those are also the victims of those DoucheScalpers.<p>As a patron I really wouldn&#x27;t mind guaranteeing my reservation with a small, up front payment.

7988197,comment,7985392,7987137,3,0,_mulder_,,,"Music is like your own personal life-diary that you don&#x27;t even have to write. Music is such an important trigger for memories (along with smell which is even more powerful but less controllable) but the majority of people seem to take it for granted and make no effort to preserve these memories. It&#x27;s staggering how hearing a song you haven&#x27;t heard for 20+ years can immediately put you right back to being a kid, or some other nostalgic memory, even if only fleetingly.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m overly sensitive to having my music memories overwritten; I&#x27;ve been known to leave clubs or bars or turn off the radio if a particularly personal song is playing because I don&#x27;t want my original memory to be overwritten. My friends don&#x27;t understand, to them music is just music and something to dance or shout along to. A handful of songs provoke extremely potent memories in my mind of when I was a kid. Hearing these songs is the only channel I have to experiencing that time of my life. \nThe problem, and half of the beauty of it, is that I don&#x27;t actually know what the songs are until I hear them. I keep intending to compile a list of which songs trigger these memories.<p>Infact I, along with most people I imagine, have a whole library of songs that read as mile-posts dotting throughout their life. Perhaps a particular song triggers a memory of a summer holiday, or high school party, or road-trips as a kid, or even just what you listened to whilst coding your first successful project.<p>The single worst thing that can happen to music is for it to be used for advertising. What may be a catch song to a marketer could be someone&#x27;s last memory of a dead parent or friend. I commend artists, especially Radiohead, who vehemently forbid their music to be used for anything after it&#x27;s been released. Thom Yorke (I think) did a great interview on the subject but I can&#x27;t find it, annoyingly.",1404471194
7988195,comment,7987553,7987944,3,0,Karellen,,,"&quot;You can find 4 cores in a trivial computer these days (8 cores with hyperthreading).&quot;<p>There are still plenty of tablets and phones out there which don&#x27;t. (And the author <i>is</i> targetting those devices with the software he&#x27;s writing)<p>&quot;It&#x27;s true it has overhead, but you don&#x27;t have to create thousands of processes,&quot;<p>Ah, but that might be a natural consequence of your design. I think part of the problem is that we&#x27;re currently in the middle of a really awkward transition period in computer architectures.<p>As you point out, almost no computers are single core nowadays. So having a single-process application is obviously not taking advantage of all the computer power you have at your disposal. It&#x27;s blatantly sub-optimal.<p>However, if you&#x27;re going to design a multi-process application framework, you probably want to design it to kick off new processes whenever you&#x27;re about to do something non-trivial that could introduce significant latency into the mix. But depending on what the user/application user is actually doing, that <i>might</i> potentially end up starting dozens, or hundreds, or even thousands of processes.<p>And our computer architecture is not yet at the point where we have &quot;enough&quot; cores in our CPUs that we can just do that and have it work. We&#x27;re getting there, but it&#x27;s likely a decade or maybe two away.[0]<p>So, we want to create a multi-process architecture to stop wasting the computing power that exists; but we have to be careful and write extra code to managing creating these processes, because we can&#x27;t yet afford to create them &quot;on a whim&quot;.<p>It seems similar in some ways to segmented 16-bit memory models. In an early flat 16-bit memory model, you were very constrained (64k) but at least the environment you were working in was simple. The move to a segmented 16-bit model was in some ways a lot less constrained, but taking advantage of it meant dealing with a bunch of extra complexity. (boo!) It was the next step to flat 32-bit systems which made working with memory painless and simple again, while further lessening the constraints.<p>When low-end phones and tablets have >=256 cores, then we&#x27;ll be able to take advantage of multi-process frameworks properly.<p>It occurs to me, having seen Alan Kay&#x27;s talk a few weeks ago and being fascinated by the idea of &quot;spending money to get ahead of Moore&#x27;s law&quot; to put together a computer that would allow you to write the sort of software to take advantage of computers a decade from now, but couldn&#x27;t figure out what that meant if you wanted to do it now, I imagine that putting together a >=256 core system might be a good start.",1404471181

There are arguably more things wrong with JavaScript than with any other popular programming language, as evidenced by book titles like &quot;JavaScript, the good parts&quot;. This is common knowledge; we&#x27;re all trying to do good work <i>despite</i> JavaScript, seldom because of it. So Node: it&#x27;s fast, we can share code with the browser, but it&#x27;s a bitch to use. We knew that when we signed up.<p>Conversely, Python is a great language but it&#x27;s not as easy to make it go fast. It&#x27;s slow, but it&#x27;s great to use. We also knew <i>that</i> when we signed up.<p>It&#x27;s great that Go is getting more mainstream adoption! Deservedly so. But it&#x27;s probably still easier to be super-productive developing a CRUD app in Ruby or Python. And it&#x27;s still easier to share code between backends and web frontends with Node. If you don&#x27;t need either of that, and you do need performance, then, yes, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t pick Python or Node.<p>I agree that Go is a great option to consider, but Zef is framing it a little as a silver bullet, and well, of course it isn&#x27;t.",1404468222

The question is how many errors are silenced. Stats will be hard to come by. But getenv and JSON parsing are pretty basic functionality and in most languages with exceptions they would not silence errors.

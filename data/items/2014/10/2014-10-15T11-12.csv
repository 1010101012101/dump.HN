But I do worry about the cognition overhead the syntax causes, and I do wonder if there is a &quot;better way&quot;.<p>What about dynamic language + runtime type checking + (nearly) 100% test coverage?
You get the flexibility of a dynamic language and the safety of a static type language (in fact you get more, since runtime type checking is more powerful).",1413374303

It exploits certain double-byte biases in RC4 keystreams (the Fluhrer-McGrew biases). It targets plaintext bytes located at any position in the TLS plaintext stream. The number of encryptions needed to reliably recover a set of 16 consecutive targeted plaintext bytes is around 10 times 2^30, but already with only 6 times 2^30 sessions, these target bytes can be recovered with 50% reliability. Since this double-byte bias attack does not require the TLS Handshake Protocol to be rerun, it can in practice be more efficient than our single-byte bias attack.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/RC4biases.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/RC4biases.pdf</a><p>edit: I could not get star to show-up, so I just spelled it out as &#x27;times.&#x27;",1413374107

This actually happens to a non-zero percentage of transactions, and this is OK, because they get investigated and recovered by CS teams.  (Banks, surprisingly, aren&#x27;t <i>actually</i> ACID even though everyone uses them as the canonical example of an ACID application.)<p>Escalate with your bank.  You do not want to speak to Tier 1 telephone CS on this.  You want to speak to someone in their wires investigation department, or to someone who can escalate a call to them.  A very quick way to achieve this is to go to the local branch, ask to see one of their business representatives, and explain the situation then sit while they resolve things.  If they get the runaround, you ask for the branch manager, mention $10k+ is on the line, and he escalates for you.<p>Another example is calling directly into the wire investigation group.  Now that you know it exists, you can probably figure out how to find it on Google.  (If you can&#x27;t find their group call the Wealth Management group and say &quot;Hiya, someone told me to call you guys.  $BIGCO made an incoming wire to my $MYBANK account and it has gone missing.

That should <i>never happen</i> with regards to one single payment, because routine business mishaps (like, e.g., a bank delaying a payment) will routinely cause events like this to happen.<p>There are a variety of ways to control for your risk for this.  Two which you should implement, as soon as reasonably practical, are a) building up a savings buffer such that you&#x27;re not dependent on your cashflow to eat and b) charging more, which is partially justified by risks you absorb from having a freelancer/consultant/etc charging model and not being a W-2 employee who could walk to Payroll and say &quot;I don&#x27;t care what the problem is, just fix it&quot; and having the expectation that Payroll would <i>leap</i> to fix that.",1413372419

But that still means that closely-aligned countries can survive without spying on each other. I might not have all the facts, but it seems unlikely that Germany or Brazil would be considered an existential threat to the US in the foreseeable future, so why spy on those countries? Slight economic advantages don&#x27;t seem to justify the breach of ethics.<p>I guess I can see what you are saying and I don&#x27;t think we can have a world without spying any time soon. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all international spying is justified.",1413372324

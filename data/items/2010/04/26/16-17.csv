Lots of such people finance art throughout history - the Catholic Church, for instance, has been pretty barbaric at various times, but also commissioned a lot of history's greatest art. The Tokugawa Shogunate financed much of the art from 1600 to 1850 in Japan, the various dynasties in China, and so on.<p>> we'd have to move to a different socioeconomic model than the corporate-dominated mess we have now, in which parasites who don't actually do anything have almost all of the power, and the truly creative are almost always treated as pawns.<p>Isn't the internet doing just that?

1295160,comment,1294419,1294989,0,0,jpr,,,"I find that with a good, type-aware compiler such as SBCL, Common Lisp hits a really sweet spot on the typing issue. It catches a crapload of mistakes at compile time that would be runtime errors in Python (the language, incidentally the SBCL compiler is also named Python) and most other dynamic languages. The type-language of CL is also more expressive than anything else I have seen, featuring unions, intersections, predicates, subtyping etc. But most importantly, it stands in the background, and doesn't stop you from executing programs that don't conform to some preconceived notion of what typing should be like.",1272297634

Good Knowledge of AMPS,GSM,CDMA-2000,3G,LTE, OFDMA,Channel fading, Channel estimation.<p>4)Projects-<p>UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT ARLINGTON<p>Working on eZ430-RF2500( msp430 embedded module) using SimpliciTI protocol, for development of wireless sensor monitoring system.
End device captures the data from sensors, converts the analog data to digital using ADC10 module of msp430 and then sends 
it on the RF link with support of SimpliciTI protocol. The Access point receives the RF data, process it and displays 
it on to hyperterminal using serial port.
Use Labview for data acquisation.<p>Wireless powering of msp430 microcontroller for bio-implantable devices-
 wireless powering is acheived using electromegnatic induction principle up to distances of 8cm.<p>Interrupt driven Bidirectional communication system using RS-485 protocol-
Consists of two separate designs-a controller and peripheral node.Controller provides a serial port       
Through which commands can be entered from PC.Controller outputs parsed commands on a 4-wire 
RS-485 bus.The peripheral deciphers the asynchronous data stream to control o/p device.It will send 
Acknowledgement back to controller to indicate successful receipt of data.
Microcontroller used-PIC24FJGA002, Softwares-MPLAB ICD, DEV C.<p>High speed ESD protection circuits-
A research project, discussed causes of ESD in integrated circuits, different methods to overcome the same problem with comparative analysis.<p>Design of various IIR and FIR filters using MATLAB-
Designed a low pass prototype elliptical filter then, Using designed filter obtained high pass, band pass, band stop and notch filters using different methods
 such as addition, subtraction and cascading.
Designed a Type-1 FIR filter then, Design various filters using different windowing methods.<p>Working on design of bootloader for PIC24FJGA002-
Aim is to program PIC microcontroller without using IDE. Microcontroller will be programmed through serial, USB or either through wireless link.
Softwares-C, windows C, Visual c++.<p>Writing  RTOS for PIC24FJGA002-
Wrote a C and inline assembly code that implements preemptive RTOS with support for semaphores, yielding, sleep function and system timers,
 Prioritization was done to service high priority processes effectively, Task Control Block (TCB) was used to handle process stack, state, priority level etc.<p>Position estimation of robots using ultrasonic pulses and co-ordination amongst robots using RF-link-
Worked on RF communication team for data transmission between Base station and Robots, Base controls the robots by
sending different commands on RF-link. Also worked on RTOS and integration team to complete working of project.

Although I didn't appreciate it at the time, having survived the abject misery of the first 2 years of a physics Ph.D., everything else has seemed manageable in comparison. A few years ago, they changed the format of the written exam to a single 8 hour day.  My thesis defense was a total cakewalk.

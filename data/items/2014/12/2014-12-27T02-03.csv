In fact for languages like C++ where a single statement can do a lot of implicit things, I prefer to debug in Asm since I can see exactly where things went wrong.<p>Maybe education is partly to blame, as many students are taught that the only thing they interact with is the source code, the binary being an opaque blob that comes out of a one-way process, and trying to go the opposite way is somehow seen as &quot;wrong&quot; (legal issues notwithstanding); the emphasis on low-level architecture and Asm as &quot;you&#x27;re not supposed to know this&quot; further adds to the notion, along with the increasingly closed nature of software and hardware.

For example, the digital situation of Chess really sucks in the work right now, so for the last few months I&#x27;ve devoted about 10 to 15 hours a week to created a catch all solution to playing chess online and on your phone. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where I can now use it to play with my brother, dad, sister and friends. As a person that lives a fair ways away from my family, it&#x27;s really rewarding to be able to do something like that. I love getting input from them, and just being able to bond with them over something simple.<p>As far as the motivation, and not just the desire, it also came down to understanding how I work. I burn out quickly if I work on something a ton, and so I have an incredibly strict schedule during the week, and then completely leave the weekends open. Essentially, I kind of made a compromise with my personality so that I ended up happier, and my professional life came out ahead.<p>In addition to that, I educated myself.

None of these disabled features save any transistors or die area; the disabling just leaves you with a dead spot on the chip. So the real question is if you&#x27;ve got the hardware in place to provide these special features, can you save any power by not using those features?<p>The answer is that you only save power by not doing at all the things those features accelerate. It&#x27;s never more efficient to implement AES through general-purpose instructions than using the fixed-function hardware. If you&#x27;ve got a workload that can benefit from the wider SIMD units, it won&#x27;t save any energy to only use the narrower instructions. If you&#x27;re trying to secure or virtualize your OS, doing it with VT-x and VT-d will be so much faster than emulating it in software that even if those features added several watts to the chips power consumption you would still save energy.<p>Doing less can save power, but doing the same amount of stuff the hard way doesn&#x27;t help anything.",1419646545

It is virtually impossible as a startup to have a profitable relationship with the civilian U.S. federal government due to the mind boggling overhead and an extremely slow, paperwork driven, and politicized process that makes enterprise sales seem easy.<p>Mind you, defense and intelligence is the same but with one important exception: if you can address a critical operational need, they have the ability to make the absurd overhead go away and pay real money. It is why startups have always had much better luck there than the government at large; you are not automatically subject to a Byzantine multi-year process that will probably never pay off. But even then, it is a challenge to get to the right people. Nonetheless, they are constantly inventing vehicles like In-Q-Tel that have no civilian equivalent to funnel money to startups.<p>Enterprise is definitely easier than government in most regards from the perspective of a startup.

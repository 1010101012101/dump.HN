Rather, think of it more as listening and attaching something to an event.<p>For me, it helps to think of signals less as interrupts in a traditional program loop, but as something more akin to events in event-driven environments.",1247997208

They'll be purchasing Sybase, Oracle, and MS SQL Server for the project. Why all three? That's likely 100s of thousands of dollars right there.<p>Also, why are they contracting this out? Why not hire a small team, and release in stages via some agile project management techniques?<p>I doubt this is a big deal in the grand scheme of things however its the sort of thing that sort of reminds you that no matter who is in power, things run the same way in Washington.",1247997059

712801,comment,712096,712191,0,0,cstross,,,"Valid reasons for government regulation of space travel 101:<p>1. We have a technical term for a simple, rapid-to-launch vehicle (like Falcon 1) that can deliver c. 400Kg into LEO: we call it an ICBM.<p>2. Even in the absence of a CBW payload, a well-targeted RV can do a <i>hell</i> of a lot of damage. KE at orbital velocity is an order of magnitude higher than the equivalent chemical energy stored in the same mass of TNT, so even if that hypothetical 400Kg payload is cement, it's going to do one hell of a lot of damage to anything it hits.<p>3. Accurate targeting of RVs was considered to be a very hard problem ... in the 1940s and 1950s. Let us recall who the initial cash cow customers for Fairchild Semi and (subsequently) Intel were, and consider the implications.<p>Anyway, upshot: no government in their right mind is going to allow orbital launches (or even sub-orbital) without at least some oversight, if only to ensure that the customer isn't Dr Evil.",1247996627

712792,comment,712653,712755,0,0,ankeshk,,,"I should stress that I'm talking about selling ads privately.<p>$2 CPM per ad at 6 ad spots = $12 CPM for the website.  You will very rarely earn $12 CPM from Google.<p>FreelanceSwitch.com sells 125*125 ad spots at $900 (raised from $800 recently).  And gets 500,000 page views.  (Pretty close to $2 CPM).<p>SearchEngineJournal.com sells ad spots for $1000.  And gets 300,000 page views ($3.3 CPM).<p>If you're selling ads privately - and show your analytics to your advertisers - they won't say that reduce my CPM rate as your traffic has increased.  And if they do - you can just put up an ad-rotator so that their ads are only shown to as many people as they can afford.<p>And if you show your analytics that has a trend of increasing traffic - you will start finding better quality of advertisers too - people who will not mind paying a higher CPM.<p>So yes - as your traffic grows and you attract enough advertisers to sell all your ad inventory - you can increase your prices slowly and steadily.  The trick is to reach a stage where you can sell all your ads privately.<p>Its supply and demand after that.  (Supply of ad spots remains the same.  Demand keeps on growing as your website grows in popularity.)",1247995730

However, it feels very comfortable if you have a desk with a large screen (or screens) and perhaps an external keyboard and mouse that you can all attach to the laptop for heavy duty work. (As well as external hard drives and whatever tertiary storage you may need.)<p>If you are going to carry it around, make sure to back up religiously.

712781,comment,712653,712653,0,0,adinobro,,,"As others have said it depends on what your site is about. If your site already exists there isn't much you can do but if you are planning to create a site then you can find out what the CPM average is by using Google Adword tools to find out how much people are paying for the key words. That will give you a fairly good idea of what you can charge. As others have already said you will make more money if you sell adds yourself but I would only budget two or three times the price not ten or one hundred times markup.<br><br>
Also a pure add model isn't generally the best idea. If you link to a realted product you can often get comissions that are much higher than the CPM average that you will get for adds. Without context you can only assume that you will get $0.15 CPM. Social networking sites are probably slightly less.",1247994997

712772,comment,712487,712564,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I disagree to a certain extent.  I see your point on using a feed reader for irregular sites but I think youâ€™re just as likely if not more likely to accidentally miss something on a site like HN or Digg because thereâ€™s such a high volume of posts.<p>The fact that youâ€™re trusting ""the crowd"" to do your filtering at all presents a problem.  Because even in a community of likeminded people like HN we all have our own special interests which arenâ€™t necessarily shared by the crowd (one example, I program in .Net but most HN readers donâ€™t so a lot of good .Net stories never make it out of the ""New"" section)<p>So in the end that's the problem the author is laying out.  How do you take a large number of messages and make the feed reader as effective as it is with the small sites?  I don't know the answer either but I think it's still a huge problem being left on the table.",1247994087

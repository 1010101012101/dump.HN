Two years ago I tried several options, here are the screenshots if you care:<p>Aquamacs: <a href=""http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/1.png</a>\nRegular emacs, using mac's native UI with the pretties font I tried (and I tried quite a few): <a href=""http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/2.png</a>\nRegular emacs, using X, with the font I normally use on Linux: <a href=""http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/3.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/3.png</a>\nEmacs ran inside Apple terminal: <a href=""http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/4.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/4.png</a><p>As you can see, (1) and (4) kicks (2) and (3)'s ass with respect to the looks of the font. (4) would be a good option, especially since it comes with the OS X, but you have to use ESC, key instead of meta+key (b/c of Apple terminal), which kind of sucks.<p>Plus, Aquamacs lets you set the color theme:<p><a href=""http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/default.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/default.png</a>\n<a href=""http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/black.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/black.png</a>\n<a href=""http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/classic.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/classic.png</a>\n<a href=""http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/xcode.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mogiel.net/~pfedor/emacs/xcode.png</a><p>Aquamacs has some behaviors that I don't very much care for, like opening a new window every time you open a file, but it can be easily fixed in the .emacs file.",1210988984

192408,comment,191729,192061,0,0,kashif,,,"First off, I regret using the tone I have used in my previous post because it seems to have made you angry.<p>My point is that your discussions on a bulletin board doesn't change ground realities. Some piracy exists because there seems to be a valid need, needless to say that some piracy exists to fulfill greed. The high dependence on computing in todays world has forced people to use software - most of which, especially for the not so technically inclined, is expensive. Outside of the US, a copy of windows is more expensive than one months earnings. The whole problem is not as binary as you suggest.<p>Stuff you pointed out that has nothing to do with this discussion -<p>* 'Situational Ethics' is the kind of term that applies only in a intellectual masturbation of this sort.<p>* Clergy are not the only people doing charity.<p>* Your convictions are not my convictions.<p>PS: I wonder if you have any MP3s of songs that you never purchased. Honestly...",1210988583

192404,comment,192343,192389,0,0,babul,,,"The nice thing about AWS is it takes away many of the hassles of scaling up quickly and headaches of hardware failure, but it is actually cheaper to own and run your own server for a early stage startup as hardware costs are generally covered in the first year (there are many comparisons, Google it).<p>Plus if you have a good relationship with an ISP (free/low-cost hosting and bandwidth), I would go with that.",1210987834

The stories are interesting, each is better ""written"" than many a Hollywood drama.<p>Also, it is just fascinating to listen to accounts from pre-Christian times. The characters share many common human traits with us, but are also deeply different. It will make you question what it means to be human.",1210986547

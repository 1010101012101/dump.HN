I have a lot of problems with his reasoning, but I just got to the point at 33:00, where he seems to take a huge U-turn from the implications that calories in/calories out is wrong, and brings up with this quote:<p>""To explain obesity by overeating is as illuminating a statement as an 'explanation' of alcoholism by chronic overdrinking.""<p>Then he attacks the idea that behavior is unrelated to physiology -- where did he get that straw man?  As far as I know, everyone who blames obesity on overeating also believes that the amount we eat is affected by many factors, including physiology.  So please tell me, before I watch the rest of the video, does he <i>really</i> disagree with the idea that obesity is caused by overeating, or does he merely believe that saying so doesn't do justice to the fact that overeating has complex causes of its own?",1246330566

Whenever something like the quarterlife crisis is brought up, there is a strong current of thinking that goes something like ""These people should just get over themselves""<p>Fact is, there are a number of huge factors working against young people these days. Consider the following:<p>- You can't get a decent job without a decent education. It used to be that a highschool graduate could get a job that paid enough to support a family, a concept that is completely absurd these days. Kids these days are finishing  school <i>much</i> later than their parents, and they don't have a choice.<p>- the cost of school is sky-rocketting, as it debt.<p>- A rapid climb in income inequality over the last generation (check the historical gini index for reference) means that there aren't very many quality, well paying jobs available to young people.<p>- young people will be stuck with the bill to clean up the fucking mess we're going through right now AND pay for the retirement and medical care of the people that have brought about this shit-storm.<p>The end result is, society has raised it's children with the wrong set of values, with policies that screw them over and now tries to wash it's hands clean by essentially saying that the stupid kids should have seen it all coming when they were pre-pubescent teens and manouvered around it.",1246330337

It's also dead simple (once it's set up) for non-technical users to run a blog using that interface, and would be of great use (I imagine) in a situation where bandwidth is at a premium, like in remote environments where all you've got is an expensive satellite uplink.<p>Tumblr, on the other hand, is very much more of a social/media blog platform. It's got that feature where you can re-blog something and it automatically links back to others who have done that, among other neat features. I'm also a big fan of its bookmarklet for sharing links and media, and while it's fine at doing text, it's in no way exceptional.<p>In short, I consider Posterous to be a very well-executed text-centered longer-form blogging system, whereas Tumblr is more optimzed for media/content sharing and short-form text - although both would work for either niche.",1246328564

680099,comment,679996,680078,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"""Depends on the field"" isn't really a good argument, because the counterargument is that the same thing applies for people without college degrees. Some make minimum wage, some make more than the average given in the article. Just as an example corresponding to yours, laborers on oil rigs make really good money straight out of high school. In particular, here in Canada during the oil boom (now not so much) it was quite common for a laborer straight out of high school to make $50 - $80 US an hour in northern Alberta.

Of course if you're doing well you can have a good amount of both, it's only when there isn't a lot of wealth that it gets to be a real tough choice.",1246327869

Is this a good thing?<p>Wouldn't you feel pretty violated if you thought that you were making an ethical choice, only to have the person helping turn out to be a cheat? (e.g. killing someone to put them out of the misery only to find out that they still had a desire/will to live)<p>An even better example would be if you were boycotting the RIAA by buying music from an independent label that claimed they weren't part of the RIAA.  Only to find out that .5% of their profits really <i>were</i> going to the RIAA. Wouldn't you feel violated if all that time you thought that you were doing a good thing boycotting the industry, but you weren't entirely? Obviously it's better than if you were buying directly from big name labels like Sony,etc but you're still going to be pissed off at being misled.",1246327789

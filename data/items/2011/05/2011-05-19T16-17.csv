The potential for a course/book that takes SICP and improves on it is really neat.<p>Also, there's a really interesting bit toward the end that I'd like to call out for those who might not have read that far:<p>""...Still, the htdp curriculum has had an interesting measurable effect concerning female students. Several instructors reported
that female students like the HtDP curriculum exceptionally well. In a controlled
experiment, an htdp-trained instructor taught a conventional AP curriculum and
the Scheme curriculum to the same three classes of students. Together the three
classes consisted of over 70 students. While all students preferred our approach
to programming, the preference among females was a stunning factor of four. An
independent evaluator is now investigating this aspect of the project in more depth.""",1305824312

We had a generic $600 mattress before we got our expensive tempurpedic and I had constant back pain after a few years of sleeping on it, often times I found myself waking up at 2-3AM to head down to our couch for the rest of the night because my back hurt so much.  The nights I did make it through the night in the bed I could barely walk in the morning because my back was so far out of alignment.<p>In comes the Tempurpedic and pillows... After the first nights sleep on the new bed %90 of the pain was gone.. by the second night I felt like a new person, no pain to be found. Since then I have yet to have any back pain.<p>The tempurpedic's are expensive, but when you consider what most people spend on a car relative to what they spend on a bed they are nothing, and besides they improve quality of life far more then any car could.

The majority of those Kindle sales could be from $0.99 bargain books. In a way that would be even better for Amazon because it means the Kindle is complimenting rather than cannibalizing its dead tree sales. Either way, it's a little early to believe Amazon is getting more revenue or profit from Kindle books than from dead tree books.<p>Also, running the Kindle store has placed a burden on Amazon it didn't have with dead tree sales. If the Kindle Store is anything like the iOS App Store, free books outsell paid books by 6-to-1 or more. So Amazon has to pay the digital distribution costs for a lot of books that bring in zero revenue. That adds up and can chip away the profit it makes on non-free books.",1305824095

The app has done fairly well on the Android Market so far, but I perhaps misjudged the type of users attracted to the Amazon AppStore. The app is immature to say the least, and hasn't gone down very well with Amazon users thus far. But that didn't matter since my main aim was to test out how the Amazon store worked, and whether or not I would use it in the future.<p>So today I decided to remove my app, since it isn't doing well there and reflects poorly on my work going forward. I contacted Amazon through their help system and asked for the app to be removed. I received a response informing me that the app must be removed from all other similar stores in order for them to remove it from theirs.<p>I'll post the full email if someone wants to take a look at it, but they pointed me to section 3.a. of the developer agreement:<p>3.a. Delivery Commitment for Apps. You will deliver electronically to us and continue to make available during the Term all versions of all software applications, games or other digital products (including any special or collectors editions) (i) that are designed for the Platform, (ii) for which you have the rights required under this Agreement, and (iii) that are the same versions and editions (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement) that you or your affiliates make available directly or indirectly to any Similar Service....<p>This reads to me like Amazon want all my apps, and won't let me remove them from their store unless I remove them from everywhere! Am I reading this wrong? Or have Amazon laid claim to all the Android apps I've made or ever will make as long as I maintain an account on their AppStore? I'm happy to terminate the contract, which appears to invalidate this clause, but I had hoped to use the store for more useful applications better targeted at the Amazon market in the future so would rather not if I do not have to. But this agreement reads to me as very heavy handed.<p>Any advice?",1305823434

Apply for College
4 years of Pre-Med (all those hard science classes)
Take MCATs (maybe twice)
Apply for Med School
2 years of lecture (8 hours of lecture + 6-8 hours of studying)
Take Step 1 of the Board Exams
2 years of Rotations
Take Step 2 of the Board Exams
Apply for Residency
1 year of Residency
Step 3 of the Board Exams
1-3 years more of Residency
Specialist examinations
Finally, If you passed everything and got accepted to Med School and Residency programs, You are now a Practicing Doctor. (Lets not even get into the debt youve just accumulated).<p>The Life of an aspiring doctor is one of perpetual studying and test taking. This isnt necessarily a bad thing considering the responsibilities a Doctor has.<p>For a profession that is so focused on learning and acquiring new skills, you would think there would be amazing tools to help make the life of a student a little easier.<p>Sadly, youd be mistaken.<p>Between recycled lecture notes and $100+ textbooks, students have few resources for outside support. Wikipedia has become the defacto resource of Med Students across the country.<p>Answers.Md Is my attempt to make the painful process of becoming a doctor a little less excruciating.

2564494,comment,2563946,2564361,14,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Sure, and IPO is essentially a sale of an unpriced piece of equity. Nobody knows <i>really</i> how much its worth but as with earlier funding rounds various techniques try to estimate the value going out the door. That value is the combination of ""price per share"" * ""total outstanding shares"" so the total value of the company.<p>The company registers to sell a certain number of shares, this is additive to the total number outstanding, so once you have what will be the new total, and what you think will be the value of the company, you divide value by total and that is your price per share.<p>Then you go out on a 'road show' where you talk to various other banks and other investors and you say ""We think the company is worth between X0$ and X1$ for these reasons and that is a share price of between $Y0 and $Y1, would you be interested in buying shares?"" and they may say ""Not really."" or ""Sure we'd love to by n shares at $Y0 and maybe n1 (often less than n) shares if it was at the high end of $Y1""<p>Now at some point on this road show, if you're good and the company's prospects look great, you have people who have signed up to buy all your shares, even if it comes out at the higher price. That has <i>validated</i> your price point, now if you haven't even talked to half your prospects you might decide to raise the offering price or increase the number of shares, you go back and call the folks who committed before and make sure they are still on board.<p>Now you have a list of people who are willing to buy your stock, and then when the market opens you sell them that stock at the high end price, and collect your money.<p>Now <i>those</i> people (and the bank that is the 'market maker') for the stock may be willing to sell the stock for a premium over what they paid for it. Other investors who have read the S-1 but weren't part of the initial roadshow might say ""I'd buy this stock even if it was 20% higher than that initial price."" and they put in a buy order for it, someone says ""Hey a quick 20%! I'm down!"" and sells them the stock they bought at the IPO price from LNKD.<p>The price bounces around and then lands at a point where nobody else is willing to buy it for any more money than it is being offered at. Nominally the 'market' price for that company.<p>Now if people start buying the stock for <i>any</i> price because they just ""want in on the action."" as it were, then the price can rise above the price that is supported by the fundamentals of the company, and <i>that</i> is a speculative price rather than a market price. Stocks priced on speculation define a bubble.<p>So LNKD priced at $45 I think, they had more demand than they could meet, and the price has risen. Are speculators buying it? Hard to know yet but it seems like there is some speculation going on.",1305823182

When a user gets a ebook reader for the first time they will buy lots of books to fill the device, including books they already own. Once sales to new users drops off the sales rate will also flatten out.

For instance, why, after say a time period t (set by reasoning about the particular context, allowing for the maintenance of competitive advantages, etc.), shouldn't people outside of an institution be able to see internal records of how decisions (and thus perhaps very important mistakes or triumphs) were made?  Surely the information has utility to the public, if only for historical reasons.<p>If an institution is unwilling to allow that, then hypocrisy threatens when they would deny individuals in other institutions (even if it is just a social discussion group) the same right to privacy about how internal affairs are conducted.",1305820972

2564355,comment,2564265,2564265,2,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>To me, it looks like all these frameworks provide the same functionality, but with different languages, databases, and web servers.</i><p>Basically, yeah.<p><i>Is there some kind of way to choose, or do you just pick one that youre familiar with?</i><p>To be honest? There are too many out there, to actually do a thorough analysis / review of each, on your own.  It'd take you 10 years, and by the time you got done, it would all be obsolete.  So, ultimately, you have to fall back to <i>some</i> kind of heuristic:  recommendations from trusted friends / colleagues / etc., simple popularity, some ""back of the envelope"" calculations of some meaningful metric (availability of developers for that platform, for example), the aforementioned point of ""go with what you know,"" size and activity level of the community around each one, ease of learning, etc., etc.<p>All of that said, I'm a big fan of Groovy on Grails, which I find has a lot going for it.  But there are far more frameworks I haven't used, than ones I have, so I can't even begin to make a claim that Grails is objectively ""the best"" in any sense.  In my case, I picked it because I already knew Java, was familiar with the JVM ecosystem, libraries, app servers, messaging systems, etc., and because Groovy is very easy to learn if you know Java.  The pros I see for Grails:<p>1. Open source (most of them are these days, but still)<p>2. Easy to learn (this is relative, since I'm coming from Java)<p>3. Rapid development using convention of configuration (same as Rails, etc.)<p>4. allows me to leverage a lot of existing knowledge of using Java app servers, tools, and infrastructure.<p>5. Easy use of tons of useful java libraries that already exist.  I can easily incorporate Tika, Lucene, Mahout, HttpClient, Commons Math, etc., etc., etc.<p>Cons to Grails:<p>1. There is some question as to the future of Groovy, since the creator of the language said something along the lines of ""If I'd known about Scala when I created Groovy, I wouldn't have created Groovy.""  That said, the Groovy and Grails community seem to be very active, and I don't see any particular reason to think either will be dying off anytime soon.<p>2. Performance:  Groovy has a reputation for being a little bit of a performance dog, compared to some of the other JVM based languages.  But it has gotten a lot better with recent releases, and there's reason to think that the JDK7 changes (MethodHandles API, invokedynamic opcode) will make Groovy even faster.<p>So there ya go, a few thoughts and comments on Grails.  I'd highly recommend at least giving it a look, especially if you know Java already.",1305820866

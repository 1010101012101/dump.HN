3118287,comment,3117594,3118207,7,0,jvehent,,,"So we agree on the definition of what a sysadmin, systems engineers, devops or whatever people want to call it should be. A sysadmin must program, that's a given. When did we forget that exactly ?<p>But why are so many devs shooting at the sysadmins these days ? I never read anything from sysadmins complaining about the astonishingly low level of knowledge of a lot of devs. And they are numerous, willingly ignoring even the most basic performance issues and vomiting thousands of lines of codes, hundreds of tons of libraries, to simple problems.<p>It seems that devs are frustrated to not be able to push their random app to the web in 5 minutes, and throw their love to PaaS like an apple geek discovering the new iphone, blaming the sysadmins for not providing the same thing at their own company without even understanding (or trying to understand) how operating systems work, and how their own code should be built.<p>The real issue here is that when devs and sysadmins DON'T work together, and ignore each others problems, constantly blaming each other, then the result sucks. When the sysadmins are 20% devs, and the devs 20% sysadmins, and they drink their coffees together in the morning, you don't see that kind of problem. They built good, reliable, scalable infrastructure, whether it's in the cloud or in the basement of their house.",1318798730

Consider a rectangle where its larger side is Phi * its smaller side. If whatever process made the rectangle uneven now operates with the larger side, it will make a rectangle whose larger side is Phi * its smaller side (assuming the process is scale invariant). Of course, in reality this would be much more of a continuous process. Put another way, if a process has the following properties:<p>1) it is scale invariant
2) it is rotation invariant
3) its operation on the larger structure overpowers its operation on the smaller structure<p>then this process would produce something akin to a golden ratio spiral. So I would expect at least some things in nature to be like this, at least theoretically.<p>EDIT: that said, passing the golden ratio thing off as fact when it's just a coincidence is doing a big disservice to science, especially when done by science teachers.",1318798605

IBM will because they have a commercial product, sure, but who else?   If there are no other companies funding significant development efforts (which in practice means they have to have a commercial product), then the rationale for a company to do all of their development in the open (and possibly risk a competitor taking their code and using it in a competing product with little or no effort contributed) tends to destroy the value of the Apache project.<p>With Libreoffice taking away a large number of the community developers, it's not clear there will be enough non-IBM corporately funded developers to make OpenOffice.org successful.",1318798277

I used to be 245 and I'm female. If the OP is male/taller than me, that may be comparable.  Like the OP, I worked on getting my life back and that had the unintended consequence of also leading to significant weight loss. (I had zero goal to ""lose weight"" and was fine with how I looked.) I can't tell you how much weight I have lost because I haven't weighed myself in over 5 years.<p>I kind of think that excess weight is not The Problem per se but perhaps a proxy?  I mean, I got myself healthier and that's why I lost weight.  I think a lot of very heavy people don't know how to live right and that's a) the real reason they are miserable and b) also, coincidentally, the cause of their excess weight.  Maybe they don't know how to clearly distinguish the two things and perhaps think ""all would be right with the world if only I could lose the weight"" when it might be more accurate to say it runs the other direction (ie if all were right in their world, they would probably also lose the weight).<p>I actually have mixed feelings about losing the weight.

I recently started teaching myself by working through the problems on 4clojure.com, reading pg's _On Lisp_, and books like _Land of Lisp_, _Programming Clojure_, _Joy of Clojure_, etc., and even within a day or two of learning I found I no longer saw the syntax at all.  In fact, one of the great beauties of Lisp and s-expressions is that the syntax is so so minimal and so consistent that it all but disappears.  (Clojure is a bit more complicated, in that it introduces additional special forms for java interop, metadata, vectors and maps, but you get used to that quickly, too.)<p>A much trickier thing for me personally has been memorizing what all of the standard functions do, particularly bouncing back and forth between common lisp and clojure like I've been.  Clojuredocs.org and the clojure source code itself have been essential companions in this journey.<p>So the only thing holding you back is the parens, then have no fear, you'll actually grow to love them (especially if you're an emacs user, thanks to show-paren-mode and electric-pair-mode and the like).",1318798174

3118216,comment,3115951,3115951,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I found this disheartening. Life is complex but its not unknowable.<p>One of those 'life choices' I faced when I entered college was whether or not I wanted to 'program' computers or to 'build' them. These would guide the choice of EE or CS degree. My father asked if people with EE degrees were allowed to program computers, I said of course they were. Then he asked if people with CS degrees were allowed to build them, and the answer was no they were not generally. So if I didn't know what I wanted to do, I should get an EE degree since then I could do either.<p>Turned out to be pretty sage advice and knowing <i>how</i> the computer does what it does really helps program it. Especially if you are trying to wring every erg of performance out of it. When I graduated with my EE degree (and a minor in CS) I was proud of the fact that I could write a database in a languge for which I wrote the compiler on a computer architecture that I designed using circuits that I understood down to the physics of the PN junctions that governed the behavior of semiconductors. (It really is math all the way down sadly)<p>That being said, I firmly believe the human brain has a limit (which may be case by case) of how much stuff it can hold at one time. And the notion of abstraction, especially modularization and testable components, makes complex systems possible.<p>This  comes up in a variety of contexts. Sometimes I interview folks who can draw a nice architecture on the white board with boxes and arrows and such. So I ask them do go into one of the boxes, and lets draw that out in detail. And then those sub boxes I want to go into their detail as well. My goal is to understand that the candidate understands that 'boxes' are only a good way of thinking about something if you understand what the box is really modelling.<p>A good example of this is that naive people treat a hard disk drive like a box. It has a port you tell it to read logical block A or write logical block B and it does some magic and makes it happen. But really it screws up now and then, and it has very variable performance. So if you can't explain how you have accounted for these properties of your box then you're not thinking deeply enough about it.<p>Sometimes an 'architect' type (you know the type, Joel called them Architecture Astronauts as I recall) they dismiss your whole area of expertise as a box in their model. This can lead to some pretty dismissive thinking by the 'doers' in the crowd, but it is important to know that without abstracting that thing you're working on, the architect person wouldn't have enough brain capacity left over to see the 'bigger' picture. As long as their picture of your box is accurate, you should cut them some slack.<p>The bottom line for me is that it can be 'amazing' at how the complex system runs but words like 'mystifying' and 'dizzying' make me nervous. If you're a software developer and its 'mystifying' how your program can do what it does that is a problem you should address. There was an excellent pointer to 'what every programmer should know about memory' and there should be equivalents to 'networks', 'processor architecture', and 'disks'.",1318797044

Store it on Amazon, etc.)<p>Anyhow, great job doing it. Depending of the pricing, I'd surely use it.<p>I've seen that you make your widget code open source. I guess this handle the flash hack / html5 version for all different versions of browser? Hopefully so because that's the most annoying part of getting the ajax upload working.

This is how anyone would tell you to do it anyway.<p>d) There are a few ways to do this. i) find out where your users hang out online and offline, ii) find out what they read, iii) develop a good feedback loop with them so you improve fast, respond quick, and keep a relationship with them. I can think of many other way, but I will tell you launch now, learn and improve and see how many things that takes care of.",1318795730
3118155,comment,3117482,3117582,3,0,sjwright,,,"I think a fair response to that is to distinguish between the micro and macro. Choice of font is arguably a micro-level trend; the presentation is dealing with issues on the macro, whole-of-page scale.<p>The presenter of course has to choose a font, and he can be forgiven for not choosing Times Roman, Courier or Tahoma. What he did choose is a font that, while currently <i>in vogue,</i> is still eminently readable.<p>As for the drop shadows, they also aid readability within the context of the chosen aesthetic. (And they're definitely not 1px -- probably closer to 5px by the time it's scaled up for a high resolution projector -- the shadows are proportional and appropriate for the weight of the strokes.)",1318795719

6262283,comment,6261639,6261639,2,0,selectstar,,,"Grinders are so important with hand crafted, I&#x27;ve not dropped the $350+ on a Mahlkonig, and I go through a bag a week, so I&#x27;m happy to have the store grind.  I do have a porlex hand grinder for times when I order a bean based pack from somewhere online, but it&#x27;s time consuming.<p>One simple &#x27;hack&#x27; for using a french press, as I prefer, is that when pouring the water over only pour enough to cover the grounds.  Then stir/shake this around and let it sit for 30 seconds.  Then pour over the rest of the water and leave for 4 mins without stiring.<p>I don&#x27;t know the science behind it I&#x27;m afraid as I read this tip a long time ago, but that inital absorption rather than drowning - leads to a smoother cup. (in my opinion.)<p>Oh, and support your local roasters!  I&#x27;m lucky that in my small city there is half a dozen independent companies knocking out great quality beans.  For all the staff in their shops may look like the kind of people you don&#x27;t want to ask a question of, do it, they probably really love coffee and will be able to help your home brew immensely.<p>--Edit : Beans from Peru are my fav at the momement, give them a shot. :)",1377244711

That&#x27;s more than a bit harder to manageif you do it correctly, there are so many try-catch blocks that the rest of the code almost gets drowned out by them.

Oh well.<p>My problem with the CDBaby/Youtube relationship is that CDBaby was essentially created to take advantage of blanket claims. Youtube&#x27;s algos create a set of hashes or something of track audio. This is fine. The first to make a copyrighted claim, even if non-copyrighted uploads already exist, get precedence. This is not fine.<p>So the hundreds of copies of the man singing his heart out matter nothing once CDBaby uploads one copyrighted track that includes a part that matches.

If you do something and it tastes better, you keep doing it.  But you&#x27;re never sure if there&#x27;s some patch of the search space that you missed, that&#x27;s even better.<p>If anyone wants to make splendid coffee, and doesn&#x27;t fear learning a significant new art I&#x27;d suggest roasting your own beans.  You can do it with a heat gun or an air corn popper, modified.  It&#x27;s not simple and it&#x27;s a bit of a fire hazard, but you can get satisfying results blasting some hot air at beans in a pot.  Roasting can be more fun and aromatic than making coffee.  It is amazing.<p>For a brewer you could get a sock pot aka woodneck (or just the sock without the pot -- or just muslin cloth if you want to make your own); or, a ceramic cilio-freiling cone, or an inexpensive melitta plastic cone.  Both sock & cone are considered pour over methods but they taste different.<p>For a grinder there are too many choices to pick just one, and the good ones are expensive.  For the grinder it may be safer to avoid mass-market products, just because it&#x27;s too easy to make a mistake and buy an inadequate product.<p>[Edit: there is another effective trick to get better at brewing.

It can be discussed.<p>The US prints out reams of extra paperwork precisely so that it can be offered in multiple languages. The US fought and continues to fight proxy wars dealing with how these immigrants are integrated into the culture. New York City used to be a battleground between the Italians and the Irish. Read just about any significant span of American history and you&#x27;ll find a disagreement between two different sets of immigrants. Don&#x27;t need no West Side Story to explain it.<p>Of course, at the same time, the US invented the network standard dialect of English while making fun of Californian versus Midwestern versus New England versus Southern accents. Odd... those are <i>also</i> some of the clearest political battlefield lines historically.

I have. Here is a profile of a martyr who fought with his camera to show the world his life[2].<p>What does this have to do with copyright? Well those early days of mass demonstrations are valuable evidence of the true origins of the Syrian civil war, peaceful defiance met with violence.<p>During my monitoring and dissemination of other people&#x27;s hard fought media, I began processing some into panorama as the narrow field of view provided by handheld cams reduced much of the true impact of what the recorder meant to show to others. I made stitched images from video showing tanks awaiting a push into so-called &#x27;infected&#x27; cities[3]. I made images of the days during the fraudulent elections, of BMPs chasing unarmed civilians through the streets[4]. Later, I&#x27;ve stitched together images of war crimes that I can never remove from my thoughts. After doing this for many images I had video of which I also processed and began uploading those of potential interest, video of Assad&#x27;s troops hurling IEDs onto residential neighborhoods from helicopters for instance[5].<p>But the video that involves this discussion of copyright, is one held dear to many of the early activists. Held dear to many of those now deceased. It was a song sung by someone who himself, was killed in those early days of mass demonstrations.<p>Ibrahim Qashoush, a fireman and a poet from Hama Syria[6].<p>Ibrahim coined a song that became popular during these mass demonstrations in Hama, singing them in a multitude of breathtaking shows filled the entire town square (remember when towns had those?) with the families that lived there. Time passed, and after becoming depressed at the daily slaughter I decided to go back and make a stitched image[7] of that night in Hama, when Ibrahim sung before his throat was slit[8] for daring to sing.<p>After uploading the video to Youtube, marking the video as not copyrighted, then the image to imgur as usual I received a copyright complaint from CDBaby[9]. Apparently they thought that due to an artist of theirs including a sample of the protest audio, they retroactively owned the original protest song themselves.<p>I lodged a rebuttal saying that the video was clearly not theirs, and Youtube agreed. Attempts to contact CDBaby were futile. Having the copyright claim removed I was somewhat happy with the vindication that this dead man&#x27;s song was indeed not CDBaby&#x27;s, but infuriated that this company made ABSOLUTELY NO DUE DILIGENCE AS TO THEIR CLAIMS. Most of the time people, if they notice, can contact them saying a company like CDBaby was in the wrong. But in this case the man they wronged had his throat slit for the media CDBaby was now claiming as their own. Cue the rage.<p>Youtube removed the claim from my copy of the video[10] but when linking the original copy that I processed I noticed that CDBaby&#x27;s claim was still on their video. Looking further I found _ALL_ copies of this dead man&#x27;s voice claimed by CDBaby.<p>This is around the time I started making a stink on Twitter making sure to include CDBaby&#x27;s handle while pummeling them for stealing a murdered man&#x27;s voice.<p>Of course after this I finally had CDBaby contact me.<p>The response from their support &#x27;manager&#x27; said simply that my upload has had the claim removed, she was completely unaware or ignorant of what I was referencing since I never said my video was the problem. The fact they were blanket claiming without due diligence or occasional follow-ups to check the accuracy of their claims was the problem.<p>Only after displaying their absolute pathetic avoiding of the topic of legal ramifications for false claims online did I receive a simple follow-up from CDBaby support &#x27;management&#x27;:<p>&quot;All claims have been removed,&quot; and indeed they were, for now.<p>My position on copyright shifted in those months of shouting into the copyright void that is the Youtube/CDBaby scheme.<p>I will break every copyright possible without care.<p>Not just for those who died bravely singing songs for others to be motivated by, but because for-profit entities display far less due diligence in their corporate position than a marijuana smoker does in his hobby.<p>Now I sometimes listen to Ibrahims song, thinking of how many of those people in Hama in the crowd no longer are alive. I think of CDBaby profiting off it and who knows how many others, think of Google&#x27;s complicity in the mess, think of the lawyers who profit off it keeping the situation rolling. I think of the militant US government who is coming closer and closer to making copyrights worse than violent crime, and I get really depressed.<p>That is one of my fights with copyrights.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/HansEriksson"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/HansEriksson</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bambuser.com/channel/syriapioneer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bambuser.com/channel/syriapioneer</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/pyegah.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/pyegah.jpg</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/prkBmh.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/prkBmh.jpg</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZNy7V4Dz60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZNy7V4Dz60</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Qashoush"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Qashoush</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/R0hnb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/gallery/R0hnb</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/world/middleeast/22poet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/world/middleeast/22poet.ht...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://www.cdbaby.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdbaby.com/</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu_adzfW8tc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu_adzfW8tc</a>",1377242164

6262158,comment,6261639,6262114,5,0,cheald,,,"In general, I shoot for medium roasts just because they&#x27;re safer - I like the richer flavors from dark roasts, but most dark roasts are just burnt, which makes for a really bitter and unpleasant cup. You&#x27;re absolutely right about the range of flavors, though - I tend to like nutty coffees (not nut-flavored), and citrus/floral/peaty tend to be less appealing to me. Light roasts seem to accent lighter flavors, like citrus, whereas the darker to roast, the more accented the round, full flavors like peat and nut tend to be.<p>I actually drink my coffee black (for health reasons; I realized that I was taking in a ton of daily calories in milk and sugar) which is what motivated me to find better coffee. When you&#x27;re masking the flavor of the coffee with additives, it&#x27;s easier to get by with bad coffee, but when it&#x27;s just the brew itself, the tastes matter a lot more.<p>The lighter roast = more caffeine thing is actually (kind of) a myth; you get less caffeine per bean, but since the dark roasting process removes more water, you actually end up with a higher caffeine-by-volume content in darker roasts. If you&#x27;re using the same volume of coffee per pot (say, 4 tbsp), then you may actually end up with more caffeine from a dark roast, since substantially more of that 4tbsp will be the coffee itself rather than water left unextracted from the bean. However, the caffeine differences between something like a robusta vs an arabica bean are very significant, so if you need more or less caffeine, you can pick a roast you like with a bean that gives you the caffeine you desire.",1377242137

Lighter roasts seem to come off as citrusy and less flavorful for two reasons. First, roasters tend to use V60s to profile their beans, and the V60 disproportionately removes citrus flavor. The second reason is that many people drink their coffee immediately after brewing, when in fact the flavor completely opens up after the coffee cools down to about 140 degrees (about the temperature of a hot water faucet in a home).<p>Try a darker roast if you put cream and sugar in  your coffee. If you have a lighter roast, be sure to let it cool down to appreciate its benefits. If you buy a medium roast, keep in mind that each type of bean is unique, and certain beans have unique qualities that are highlighted by their roast, so don&#x27;t assume that the flavors you enjoy are particular to the &quot;medium&quot; roast.<p>Finally, keep in mind that lighter-roast coffees actually have the most caffeine. This is because heating the coffee breaks down the caffeine molecule, so the longer the roast process and the darker the roast, the more caffeine is broken down.",1377241309

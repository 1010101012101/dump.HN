Rather, a good regex engine should start with recursive backtracking (ideally JIT&#x27;d) and fall back to the Thompson NFA if the regex supports it and the recursive backtracking approach is taking too long. Think of it like the adaptive sorting algorithms that switch between insertion sort and quicksort based on the size of the collection.<p>This approach gives you the best of both worlds: speedy operation in the common cases in which recursive backtracking beats the Thompson NFA, all the regex features you know and love, <i>and</i> worst case polynomial running time for regexes that the Thompson NFA supports.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would have prevented this bug, though, because I don&#x27;t think the Thompson NFA supports the recursive backreference thing that this regex uses.",1454093966

The fault is with the H1B system & the consultancies which exploit the H1B system.<p>1. The H1B visa is supposed to be a &quot;skilled visa&quot;. But currently this visa is purely based on luck and not on skills & that&#x27;s how many bad apples game the system. The DOL approves LCA based on minimum wages. The consultancies just pay the minimum wages and bring in the H1B employee. This minimum wage should be increased to match the salary of a skilled American worker. So that this exploitation will stop.<p>eg: (the salaries are approximate)<p>In Arizona , the minimum annual salary for LCA is 62K, the average salary paid to an American worker is 115K. Consultancy firms like TCS,Infosys and many other local &quot;one room&quot; consultancies pays 62K and bring in H1B employees because 62K is the minimum stipulated by Department of Labor. Increasing this minimum 62K to a realistic salary like 115K will stop this abuse.<p>2. There is no easy job portability for H1B workers. Switching jobs on H1B is a precarious act and if something goes wrong, you will have to be out of the country immediately, no grace period. So to be on the safer side, many H1B employees stay silent and accept lowball offers. They also have kids who are going to school and a spouse who cannot work because they are on H4. So H1B workers job portability is not really easy.<p>Make H1B jobs portable without any strings attached. So that if an H1B employee is paid less and abused by the employer. He/She can switch jobs easily. So this will prevent H1B abuse by the employers and they will think twice before low balling an H1B worker.<p>3. H1B is a dual intent visa. Once the employer starts GreenCard process for the worker. The H1B worker is literally on shackles. The rules are so strict that the worker cannot change jobs easily. Cannot accept promotions or title change for years. The worker silently accepts this because he/she has a family & kids to support just like any other American worker.<p>All I want to convey is: The H1B employee is not be blamed for this. The very rules of the H1B system are being gamed by the consultancy companies from India.\nStopping H1B system is not the solution because all the large companies in US has huge dependency on H1B employees.<p>So to stop this abuse,\n1. Increase the minimum wages to a more realistic one. \n2. Stop lottery system and grant visas based on top salary. \n3. Make the H1B job easily portable.",1454093750

We could get a ton of value out of a simple platform. My guess of what it looks like:<p><pre><code>  * 2 seat, enough cabin for long manned missions\n  * optional autonomous or remote piloting features\n  * primarily subsonic, but perhaps with a dash capability\n  * no expectation of high speed high g maneuvering\n  * oversized electrical generation\n  * bomb truck for 16+ SDB&#x27;s\n  * missile truck for enough AIM-120&#x27;s, etc to defend itself\n  * open platform designed for continuous upgrade of radar, EW, EO, etc\n  * only low cost stealth features\n  * enough fuel capacity to loiter in theater\n</code></pre>\nSomething like this could be pretty cheap to fly and provide a lot of flexible capability as a truck for state of the art electronic systems and the emerging generation of smart munitions. It&#x27;d still be relevant in an increasingly drone dominated future as an optionally manned node in the &quot;flying network&quot;.

Has any thought been given to the accessibility story for Eve and tools like it?<p>As a blind developer, I always get a bit nervous when the future of programming is discussed in terms I&#x27;ve read used to describe Eve. It seems like a very useful way of developing apps, but one that can easily exclude a subset of the population if a11y issues aren&#x27;t thought through in advance.<p>Also, part of me is tempted to dismiss Eve because I suspect we&#x27;ll always have the current way of developing software to fall back on. But when I consider it more, I don&#x27;t find that line of thinking productive for me. For instance, lots of folks might be tempted to dismiss GUIs for blind users because graphics, but there are actually huge advantages to representing UIs as trees of objects that can be introspected and interacted with. I can write code that scans the accessibility hierarchy for a specific element and reads it, for instance. In a command line interface, that code would need to either scan for a non-specific set of characters that a curses app might use to draw a thing that looks like a button and make a guess at its contents, and even then that logic would be very brittle. So even if Eve and whatever comes after derives lots of its power from rendering concepts visually, the underlying primitives needed to do so might have beneficial a11y implications and shouldn&#x27;t be discounted because the end goal happens to look nicer than a wall of text.<p>Anyway, would be nice to see that on the roadmap if it isn&#x27;t already. Even if only 20% of programming is like this in 10 years, that&#x27;s still a substantial subset that might exclude me by virtue of the accessibility story not being thought out first.",1454093129

In my view, investment bankers have an obligation to offer whatever financial and strategic advice the particular client needs, which is a function of that client&#x27;s sophistication. Some clients are highly sophisticated, don&#x27;t need any advice, and just want you to find them a buyer at a good price. Others can, for example, simply be good technologists but otherwise not be particularly business or finance savvy, and so will need additional guidance along the way.<p>To look at this particular case, moving from a 50/50 cash/stock deal to an all-stock deal without an increase in total consideration, or without the client REALLY loving the stock of the acquiring company, makes no sense. Guaranteed money upfront is always preferable (unless there are unusual tax circumstances, which I don&#x27;t see being the case here). This should have been a major point of discussion and negotiation. And if an all-stock deal was decided upon, the client should&#x27;ve been advised with no ambiguity that there are substantial risks involved in such a deal.<p>In any case though, even for the 50/50 deal, substantial due diligence on the acquirer should have been recommended. Spending $50k to verify the quality of $290mm+ in sale proceeds is a no-brainer. This legitimately falls outside of the realm of responsibility of the banker to conduct this due diligence though, and should&#x27;ve been performed by a third party with guidance and oversight by the bankers. The bank here is conflicted anyway - their incentives would clearly be to give the &quot;all clear&quot; sign. Falsified revenue is extremely easy to catch - just follow the cash.<p>I guess the lessons here are don&#x27;t work with service providers who don&#x27;t value you, and always keep in mind that ultimately, as the client, you&#x27;re the one that has to live with the decisions that get made.<p>I&#x27;d be remiss if I didn&#x27;t mention that there are better sources of financial advice. At my firm, we take pride in deeply aligning ourselves with our clients by only charging fees upon successful completion of a transaction, and by being compensated in the same form that our clients are (e.g. had we advised Dragon, we would&#x27;ve been compensated in L&H stock, and would&#x27;ve therefore been highly incentivized to strongly recommend due diligence!). The Dragon/L&H deal is actually one of the case studies that inspired the genesis of our firm. I&#x27;d love to chat if this resonates with you: lharris@belstone.com.",1454092719

I think it&#x27;s naive to assume that the people who received this memo weren&#x27;t aware that it was bringing attention to an engineering issue that could lead to loss of human life.  I think it&#x27;s misguided and not supported by the evidence to assume that was the gap in understanding that lead to the problem.  They&#x27;re working on rockets.  People working on rockets know what the stakes are.  These are the risks engineering projects like this are structured around dealing with.<p>And I think it&#x27;s pretty disrespectful to the engineer who is still haunted by this to say that what he really should have done was switch some sentences around and that would have totally solved the problem.<p>This is a strongly worded document.<p>Making safety a priority doesn&#x27;t mean starting every engineering document with the words &quot;loss of life&quot; which is a really common outcome of engineering failures on programs like this.  Making safety a priority means putting the risk of an engineering failure up front and knowing that an engineering failure in a life-critical system is critical.  Making safety a priority means people don&#x27;t have to tell you what the stakes are every single sentence, because everyone already knows and so what you really communicate is how much risk there is, not the fact that risk exists.  Making safety a priority means even if you&#x27;re working on an engineering problem that wouldn&#x27;t lead to loss of life, you fix the thing because you might be wrong and it might be part of a correlated failure one day that does lead to loss of life.  Making safety a priority doesn&#x27;t involve writing engineering documents in a way that makes them more amenable to skimming.<p>It&#x27;s a rocket.  Engineering doesn&#x27;t have to go that far wrong on rockets for people to die.  When someone sends a letter to a VP of engineering which begins with &quot;This letter is written to insure that management is fully aware of the seriousness&quot; then everyone who receives that memo is paying attention and if they aren&#x27;t then it&#x27;s not the writing skills of the people involved that are at fault.<p>I don&#x27;t think a single person who was aware of the O-ring issue was unaware of the stakes.

Then they repeat this cycle over and over, and years later they have become Excel gurus without ever actually setting out to.<p>(Of course, the downside to all that is that they&#x27;ve now built a ton of stuff in Excel in hacky, incremental fashion, and are quite possibly using Excel to do things a real database would be much better at.

If the worker is offsite it means the work goes through their ticket system and you just wait for it to get some- but it&#x27;s probably going to get bounced back three or four times because the person didn&#x27;t read the ticket.

The rest of the phone is great.<p>It&#x27;s hit or miss. There&#x27;s a ton of apps out there, even apps you wouldn&#x27;t <i>think</i> would be out there. I was surprised that Plex and Teamviewer had Windows Phone apps.<p>Where it falls apart is apps you would <i>think</i> would have a Windows Phone app, but don&#x27;t. For example, Snapchat or Yik-Yak. Or any Google-made Google apps. In the former cases, the story is even worse than it has to be: for example, there <i>were</i> third-party Snapchat apps, but Snapchat demanded they be removed from the store and still has never made a Windows Phone app. That kind of behavior <i>almost</i> makes me think there&#x27;s a conspiracy among major app developers to kill Windows Phone. :)<p>Another area of weakness, of course, is the really small/local apps. My credit union has an Android and an iPhone app, but no Windows Phone app. Same deal with my vet.<p>I haven&#x27;t upgraded to Windows 10, because I understand some of the great things about WP 8.1 are now gone.

The paper [1] that the OP references does itself say that their conclusion is peculiar to the circumstances of China:<p>&quot;While these results do not at all suggest that international trade is in the aggregate harmful to nations--indeed, China&#x27;s unprecedented rise from widespread poverty bears testimony to trade&#x27;s transformative economic power--it makes clear that trade not only has benefits but also significant costs.&quot;<p><i>but NAFTA was a massive job killer</i><p>As it happens, Don Boudreaux [2] just published something relating directly to this:<p>&quot;since NAFTA took effect Mexicans have invested more – 59 percent more, to be precise – in manufacturing activities in the U.S. than Americans have invested in manufacturing activities in Mexico.&quot;<p>Quoting Confucius again:<p><i>Obviously you&#x27;ve never worked there!</i><p>No, I haven&#x27;t.

At a larger scale - what we&#x27;re talking about for international trade - my perception is that while China may have many barriers, knowing the right people and being able to &quot;grease the wheels&quot;, makes things proceed relatively easily. In America our regulations are taken much more seriously - we don&#x27;t have anything like their degree of corruption, but we also don&#x27;t have that as a means to get around onerous rules.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cafehayek.com/2016/01/which-way-flow-the-equity-investments-in-manufacturing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cafehayek.com/2016/01/which-way-flow-the-equity-inves...</a><p>EDIT: formatting",1454091665

Git apply works really well, and you might be surprised at how clever git-merge is when everyone finally syncs up.<p>That&#x27;s what it means to be distributed: there is no real concept of a &quot;central&quot; node, unlike Subversion.

Connecting up your\n     choice language takes about an hour.\n   - Offline replication and database streaming, standardized at the\n     protocol level, which allows you to use various combinations of\n     CouchDB, Couchbase, Coucbase Lite, and PouchDB without interop\n     problems. Plus, it means in the early part of an app (like the 0.X\n     bit), I can trivially replicate the prod DB down when I&#x27;m trying\n     to repro something.\n   - You can store your HTTP assets right alongside the DB for \n     Firebase-like asset hosting.

If start-ups predominantly get started by similar types of people you&#x27;re missing out on competition and innovative ideas. I think this applies not only to general business concepts but especially to domain areas.\nOne of the things that infrequently crops up on here is how much money there is to be made in Spanish language Christian apps, as a WASP I&#x27;m less likely to have the domain knowledge to break into that market. So it does seem rather odd that VCs might be missing out on being able to profit from a market of ~23m.<p>Then there are more social good focused start-ups that might emerge. Given all the problems the US has with racism and sexism I&#x27;d posit that a black female founder might be a good bet if they had an idea to try and improve things.<p>I was interviewing a white university student the other day who had managed to get through 2.5 years of a Computing degree before realising she was capable of being just a good developer as a man. Not that she was as good, just that she actually could be a developer, rather than being assumed to be the management / documentation type. I&#x27;m nowhere near Jon Skeet on the feminist scale but it really made me think about how under represented groups can be put off.<p>And that is the point of the article. The top thread on here can be arguing about whether 0.1% is &quot;statistically zero&quot; because what matters is perception. If a potential black female founder perceives an industry as being unwelcoming they&#x27;re less likely to enter it. There is a massive opportunity cost to get to the point where you look for VC funding, it isn&#x27;t an experiment you can just run on a whim. It is quite possible that the calibre of black women who could be founders are looking at the startup world and heading in another direction where there are much stronger social signals that they are likely to be accepted.",1454090436

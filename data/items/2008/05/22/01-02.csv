This is called the earmuff convention. For reasons explained in section 3.7, Duality of Syntax, this book does not use earmuffs so our special variable declarations look like this:<p>(defvar temp-special)""<p>Double-U Tee Eff!! I challenge you to find 5 serious lispers that don't use the <i></i> convention and/or justify going against said convention convincingly.<p>edit: In chapter 3:<p>""So lexical and dynamic variables are <i>actually completely different</i>, deservedly <i>distinct concepts</i> that <i>just happen to share the same syntax</i> in COMMON LISP code. Why on earth would we want this so-called duality of syntax?""<p>What?! You're asking why we want this duality of syntax just after saying it's because they're completely different concepts that just happen to have the same syntax... (edit: oh, I misread that. You confused me because you said there was a duality of <i>syntax</i> when you probably meant there's a duality of <i>semantics</i> (edit: wait, I reread it a couple times and I think I may not have misread it after all. It simply doesn't seem to make any sense.))<p>And you seem to imply using the stars convention reduces the power of macros, while this is absolutely not the case.<p>""A traditional convention in COMMON LISP code is to prefix and postfix the names of special variables with asterisk characters. For example, we might've chosen to name our temp-special variable <i>temp-special</i>. Since this convention is almost like having another namespace for dynamic variables, diminishing their duality with lexical variables, this book does not follow it exactly.""<p><i>Diminishing</i> duality? That's diminishing <i>unity</i> and increasing duality. The stars convention establishes a duality of syntax where there is a duality of semantics and that's a good thing. Removing the stars only makes things more confusing because you're conflating two, in your words, ""<i>actually completely different</i>"" concepts.<p>* (function '(lambda (x) (+ 1 x)))<p>That looks wrong... Let's see what my REPL thinks:<p><pre><code>  Execution of a form compiled with errors.\n Form:\n   #''(LAMBDA (X) (+ 1 X))\n Compile-time error:\n   '(LAMBDA (X) (+ 1 X)) is not a legal function name.\n    [Condition of type SB-INT:COMPILED-PROGRAM-ERROR]\n</code></pre>\nI thought so.<p>""Which is a lesser fashion crime: lexical variables with asterisks or special variables without? I tend to think the less verbose of the two.""<p>Why not lexical variables without asterisks and dynamic variables with them, then? Lexical scope is used pretty much everywhere while special scope is used seldom in comparison (it's even hidden in expansions of ""with-"" style macros a lot).",1211421551

196782,comment,196668,196728,0,0,qaexl,,,"In the context of decision making, emotions are those impulses within you that you perceive to ""move"". Though there are lots of emotions -- anger, hatred, jealousy, joy, lust, etc. -- those emotions come from two basic sources: fear (repulsion) and pleasure (attraction).<p>By movement, I specifically mean the direction of attention. We tend to avoid paying attention to what we fear, and strive to pay attention to what gives us pleasure. When making a conscious decision, fear (uncertainty, and doubt) is what makes a person hesitate. Pleasure (lust, greed) is what makes a person jump in without regard to risk. You perceive emotions by movement. You have to stand still (mentally speaking), then watch for the movement in the emotions. Because our attention naturally shy away from what we fear, those things tends to get ignored. Because our attention naturally seeks out what we like, we tend to cling to and attach ourselves to those things. When we cling to things we like, we also tend to fear losing them.<p>Instinct generally refers to survival instincts, and as such are closely tied with emotions.<p>Intuition, what I think those quotes refer to, don't refer to the absence of emotions so much as being in a state of mind where you are mentally still so you an observe all the movements of emotions. When you observe a particular emotional impulse long enough, it will identify itself to you (that is, you can rationally verbalize that emotional impulse). Once the emotion is identified and heard, they generally pass on and trouble you no more. At some point, you're left with just mental stillness. That's where intuition kicks in.<p>Just so you know, while some of this sounds like Freudian psychology, where I practice these ideas actually comes from my practice of martial arts. There is not enough time to stand there analyzing the angles and force vectors of an incoming blow, much less formulate a response. That is way too slow. Yet, someone who merely acts just on reflex isn't always able to prevail. There are people with enough trained awareness to manipulate someone's purely reflexive movements. To do well, you have to be able to not only have clear intuition, you have to be able to physically act on it to take advantage of the tiny moments of opportunity. Otherwise, you are unable to seize the initiative and execute on your strategy.<p>The story passed in martial arts lore is looking into a pool of water: when there are ripples, it is hard to see the reflection. You have to wait for the ripples to smooth over. When the reflection is clear, your image is clear, it looks almost like the real thing. But if it looks too real, and you reach out to touch the image to prove its realness, then ripples form, breaking its clarity. That's the nature of intuition.<p>I can't say I have successfully applied this to a startup, but maybe you will be able to.",1211420590

196779,comment,196668,196668,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"It's a difference of attitude more than subject.  In a way, your emotions are your instincts, but that's a bit like saying that your brain <i>is</i> your mind.  While that may be true, there's a big difference between talking about brains and talking about minds.<p>When someone says, ""Follow your instincts,"" they're saying ""Be very aware of the information that your emotions are providing to you, because it'll often be the most useful information you have.""<p>When they say ""don't get too emotionally involved,"" they mean ""If your emotions start screaming at you, don't freak out and start acting stupid.""<p>Take Jack Bauer from 24.  He acts quickly, and is very aware of the information his emotions tell him, but he also is rational and careful, which is why he sees the way out of every situation.  The similarity is pretty striking, actually.  In a startup, you're in a situation with high stakes where decisive action is crucial, the stakes are high, the odds are stacked against you, cracking under the pressure is a sure-fire way to fail, and you never sleep.<p>Be like Jack Bauer.

Specifically:<p><pre><code>  squares_under_10 = filter(lambda x: x < 10, map(lambda x: x*x, numbers))\n  \n  squares_under_10 = [number*number for number in numbers if number*number < 10]\n</code></pre>\nThose two lines are functionally different; the second one (the one the article prefers) performs a costly multiplication twice.<p>I'm not saying list comprehensions are bad... I use them a ton. I just acknowledge that there are times where map and filter make a lot of sense. Even for trivial reasons like wrapping lines, using map allows you to break at commas instead of embedding backslashes in your code and trying to decide how it should all align.<p>If you haven't, check out the itertools standard library module. The power held in these functional, generator-based functions is amazing. Since I started using it, I don't know how many times I've used:<p><pre><code>  imap(func, izip(somelist, repeat(somevalue)))\n</code></pre>\nand other such paradigms.<p>Hmm... more problems with the article:<p><pre><code>  numbers = [1,10,100,1000,10000]\n  if [number for number in numbers if number < 10]:\n      print 'Success'\n  # Output: 'Success!'\n</code></pre>\nThis is terrible. It may look nice all on one line, but it goes through the whole list when it doesn't need to. Better is:<p><pre><code>  for number in numbers:\n      if number < 10:\n          print ""Success""\n          break\n</code></pre>\nA problem with using the and ... or paradigm:<p><pre><code>  result = test and 'Test is True' or 'Test is False'\n</code></pre>\nThe page mentions that ""Test is True"" must evaluate to True or else it will always be skipped over even if test evaluates to True. It fails to mention, however that ""Test is False"" must also evaluate to True. Otherwise, if test evaluates to False, the entire expression returns False. Thus<p><pre><code>  s = foo and ""word: ""+foo or """"\n</code></pre>\nwill assign False to s instead of the desired """". In this case, it is quite clear that<p><pre><code>  s = ""word: ""+foo if foo else """"\n</code></pre>\nis preferable.<p>I didn't find the article all that helpful, personally.

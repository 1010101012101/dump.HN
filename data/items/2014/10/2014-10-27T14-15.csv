8515830,comment,8515343,8515607,0,0,72deluxe,,,"It is interesting. I have a streaming subscription to Amazon Film (previously Lovefilm) and Netflix.<p>The Android Lovefilm app (even for just choosing discs on a rental service) is hopeless. Despite being a massive company, they managed to employ what appears to be buffoons to write the software - it seems to embed a browser for showing film data and slow data parsing at that; there is no obvious navigation within it (guess where back goes - who knows if you follow down more than one tree node?!); it may crash if you press &quot;BACK&quot;; it doesn&#x27;t cache images within the list (there&#x27;s an article on Android Developer reference they could probably copy); it crashes frequently and has the largest licence list ever which makes me believe it was badly managed or written by an inexperienced developer. Surely it just needs to return JSON about the film and an image URL?
I can&#x27;t comment on the streaming app as it isn&#x27;t supported on my Android tablet, but it had been a long long long long time coming. Oddly, YouTube works on my tablet as does Netflix so the tablet can&#x27;t be incapable of decoding video (it&#x27;s a Motorola Xoom)....<p>The app on the LG TV was discontinued (it was an under-performing LG TV) so they sent me a Sony Bluray with the Amazon Instant app on it (and an ethernet port for network connectivity, not wifi) - thanks Amazon! Not only was the Amazon app slow in loading, it was slow to do anything. Starting to stream takes a while as it has to spend 30 seconds (?) working out what Internet speeds you have, and don&#x27;t even attempt rewinding - it may or may not crash the Bluray player! (I have fibre Internet so it&#x27;s not a bandwidth problem). Searching for films within it was an exercise in frustration.<p>The iOS app was far superior but didn&#x27;t like me plugging it into a TV, limiting its use - unlike others, I don&#x27;t want to sit around a tiny coffee table watching a film in mono out of the one tiny speaker on the back of the iPad.<p>Contrast this with Netflix - it started quickly on the Bluray, started films quickly, didn&#x27;t take forever to use the menu system and actually coped with rewinding and fast-forwarding. And on Android and iOS too!<p>Additionally, Amazon streaming appears to want you to BUY all of the films you&#x27;d actually want to see, as they are not included in the subscription cost, making the subscription pointless. The only films they offer are horror films, from what I can see; if you want mindless violence and people hurting each other as entertainment (why would anyone want that???), it might be good. You get better films for selection if you go with their £2 disc option and get Blurays in the post - far better value and selection.<p>I would heartily NOT recommend Amazon streaming, but do think that the Lovefilm disc system is a good deal! If I were Amazon, I would even think twice about using Amazon Streaming as a selling point - it really is quite bad.",1414421999

If you don&#x27;t agree with it, why do you have the right to not only &quot;steal&quot; the content on the website, but also needlessly shut down their revenue source just because you not only want the data for free, but you actively want to harm this person supplying the data for free.<p>Edit: I can&#x27;t reply further down. However, I included in my original statement that using adblock is an acceptable measure. Why do you actually have to shut down the publishers revenue stream and ultimately their website to show off your dislike for ads? If you want to go with your street musician example, the way I see it is that you are free to not pay him money, however to punch him in the face after listening to his music (and presumably enjoying it) is completely pointless.",1414421981

I&#x27;m also not sold on the idea that the web should be free. The happy medium is to have users pay for content, making it so advertisers don&#x27;t need to track users to verify that they&#x27;re real humans, and improving the web for everyone except poor people.<p>One way that this could be done is to use bitcoin for tiny micropayments, billed frictionlessly. Rough for legal reasons among others, but ideas like this are sensible if only for human verification reasons.<p>If you want the web to largely free content, to pay for that you must accept privacy-destroying ad networks to bear that cost. We&#x27;ve created a situation where the choice is to free ride on other people, or to surrender privacy.<p>If you want the web to be largely teasers for paid content, then you can have significantly more privacy also. Instead of the articles being articles, you will get articles that are actually big ads for paid content (already the case for a huge number of popular search results).<p>Spreading tools like these kills free content like <i>snaps fingers loudly</i> that.

Someone concerned about usability or maybe screen readers would implement his ordered list as pure text, with an explicit &quot;5. whatever&quot; even though that means a little manual rework for inserts and deletes.  Then again, its necessary because ordered HTML lists don&#x27;t work with cut and paste.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Try it under the latest firefox it won&#x27;t work.  What a POS.

But if you read the studies results, I think the difference in correlation effect size speaks for itself. In general, identical twins correlate with r value of ~0.5 and non-identical twins with <0.1.<p>The authors interpret the low correlation in non-identical twins as evidence that the traits being studied are weakly (if at all) influenced by environmental factors that non-identical twins are subjected to. They then infer (assert, w/e) that this level of weak environmental influence also extends to the set of environmental factors that identical twins are subjected to. Now, obviously as you point out, there are environmental factors that are more or less unique to identical twins, but I feel that its unlikely (and so did the authors) that these identical twin specific factors contribute significantly the vast difference in correlation between the two classes.",1414420800

It happened to Microsoft in the 90s (although, in fairness, the Internet did almost kill them). It&#x27;s happened to Google (Google Offers anyone?). And it sure as hell looks like it&#x27;s happening (big time) to Amazon.<p>Amazon is really good at two things:<p>- selling you stuff<p>- oddly enough, cloud services.<p>Several years ago they, for whatever reason, embarked on a strategy of wanting to be in online content and mobile platforms.<p>Amazon Prime was (and is) a hugely popular service. Yet it&#x27;s been bundled with Prime Instant Video, essentially a Netflix clone. Why Amazon felt this was necessary or even a good idea is beyond me.<p>As soon as you force bundle one service with the other it makes the latter worse and hides the deficiencies of the former. Good products and services sell themselves at a certain point. If Amazon Instant Video was really great, why can&#x27;t I buy just that? Why make Prime more expensive? Amazon is creating room for a comeptitor here.<p>And then we get to the Fire tablets, phones and now media sticks. Amazon decided to treat Google as a competitor here so none of their devices come with the Google apps. This is a curious move because Amazon obviously sees itself as a competitor and rival to Apple, Google and Microsoft here. Why exactly?<p>If you&#x27;re going to be in the phone business and competing with someone, do you really want to be beholden to the platform that company produces (ie Android)? Sure they can fork it (and have) but you know they&#x27;ll be taking updates too.<p>I really have to wonder if Bezos has gone all Howard Hughes lately.

Like this article says, floating-point arithmetic is often thought of as mysterious, but it really isn&#x27;t: it just obeys its own precisely specified rules. I think it&#x27;s very good to dispel the mystery, so I really like this article.<p>Another way to do the same type of error analysis of numerical algorithms is to use a parameter sensitivity library. In the end, numerical stability can be thought of as the sensitivity of the final answer to separate independent changes in each intermediate value obtained in the computation of the answer. This is sometimes overlooked, I think, and it&#x27;s quite easy to implement as well.<p>I have one quibble. They say &quot;Use (x-y)(x+y) instead of x^2-y^2&quot;. This is true, but (in my opinion) misleading: the function (x,y) -> x^2-y^2 is itself ill-conditioned when x is near y, and using a more numerically stable algorithm to evaluate an ill-conditioned function will not improve the function&#x27;s condition. If x and y are close to each other, the inaccuracy introduced by using x^2-y^2 is close to the inaccuracy due to using approximate values for x and y. So it you have x^2-y^2, I think the first thing you should worry about is whether your computation is ill-conditioned, and only then worry whether it&#x27;s numerically stable. I say this because I sometimes see people try to evaluate x^2-1, notice it is inaccurate for x near 1, and try to replace x^2-1 with (x-1)*(x+1), which is still inaccurate.",1414419640

Some software will provide fairly straight-forward mechanisms for performing some tasks (such as find and replace) and some things will end up being potentially more difficult (maybe, say, find and replace with a regex).<p>In an office setting I think there&#x27;s a good case here for having someone that&#x27;s IT/programming/automation savvy working with people to improve their day to day process.<p>I&#x27;ve actually done that before at my job, in an informal capacity.  I occasionally go sit with the folks on the operations side of the business so I can learn more about what they do, and more effectively build things for them, and often times I end up telling them a lot of tricks in excel, or word, or whatever else, that make there job easier.  In a few cases I&#x27;ve managed to create quick tools for them that substantially reduce their workload with minimal effort on my part.  In a strict cost-benefit analysis, it&#x27;s probably not worth my time, but it pays a lot in inter-department relations.  Of course, my working environment allows for that, but I mostly mean it as an anecdotal example of what I&#x27;m talking about.  ymmv.",1414418458

We&#x27;re only just beginning to tackle deep-seated problems in TLS and improve things, but we&#x27;re probably stuck with some of the most regrettable decisions, like x.509 and the CAs.<p>We need Certificate Transparency most of all for intermediates. The roots may be small in number, and many of them a little outdated, but the number of still-unaccounted-for intermediates worries me. How many have no path and/or usage restriction? Who has them? Are <i>they</i> all regulated? Because they should be. Some are likely in the hands of attackers. We should be accounting for them all.<p>The CA model, as it stands today, is inferior to DNSSEC for DV. Yes, under DNSSEC, those above you in the chain of authority can fake DNS responses, but at least no-one <i>else</i> can. If the DNS root is removed from the control of a potential attacker (not that they&#x27;d ever get away with it, but still) then I view DANE pinning as strictly superior to DV certificates (although still not perfect, but nor is DNS). The CA model may still have use with EV.<p>The problem of a transparency equivalent for DNSSEC remains unsolved, and is under tension with it being considered a bad thing to be able to enumerate domains and hosts (although it is in practice very practical to do so anyway).",1414418446

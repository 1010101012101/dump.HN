Not everyone smart immediately becomes rich, you know. I know you don't understand this, but that's how it is for the other 99% of us.""<p>Art and startups are a huge risk.  Many smart people have dumb ideas that will never make money.  Art generally doesn't make you money (even some of the most famous artists were poor their entire lives).  If those people just got a regular job, they would not be struggling to pay the rent.  I'm not saying they should do this,  I just think you should stop bitching about it.  The world doesn't owe anyone a living.<p>""By contrast, we have a world run by snake-oil salesmen and bullshitting rainmakers, while culture is utterly devalued.

If you are intelligent, you will find a way to be successful.  Any great college graduates that are stuck waiting tables have other issues.  I read a great article on how today's youth refuse to take jobs because many expect a $70,000 entry-level jobs and when they realize that they won't get paid this much, they decide to move back in with mommy and daddy.  It's this sense of entitlement that is ruining the US, not a devalued culture.<p>""Let me guess. You got really sick outside of the US and experienced another country's health system. You chalked your negative experience up to that country's health payment system rather than, I don't know, maybe the fact that getting sick really, really sucks no matter where you are?""<p>Universal health care waters down the entire system for everyone.  I would rather have the choice of a good system than be forced into a mediocre one.  Pretty much all of the people I know from Canada have come over here for any major surgery.  If the universal health care is so much better, why would this happen?<p>""We have the same problems and potentially life-wrecking bills.""<p>Universal health care isn't free.

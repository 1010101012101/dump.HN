But their monopoly share doesn't seem to have hurt the customer; and in fact, I still can find numerous non-Apple MP3 players without much trouble.<p>2. Smartphones. Nope, not even 50% of the US, much less the worldwide market for smartphones. The fact that they are much better than their competition at extracting profits is immaterial.<p>3. Tablet Computers. Clearly a yes, but in any market segment that explodes like this one, you'll have market shares that swing wildly. Currently Apple dominates this segment; but it's not clear that they will retain a monopoly position. And again, I still can find numerous non-Apple tablets without much trouble. And I don't see any damage to the consumer.<p>4. Personal Computers (i.e notebooks and desktops). Clearly not a monopolist in this segment.<p>5. Software.

Everyone has a pet theory that they're sure is correct. And in that sense the system is doing exactly what we want it to do: it's keeping out the infallibilists, the people who will advance their pet theories in spite of people on all sides pointing out the problems with it.</i><p>Of course if we're going to get anywhere we have to distinguish strong, uninformed opinions from strong, well-informed ones. But consider the problems with dumbing down the education system. It's not as if the people recruiting new graduates into the professions and complaining that they immediately have to send them for remedial training these days are making it up. There's nothing in it for universities to complain that new students arriving to study the sciences don't have enough maths to complete their first year any more. Every year, schools and government ministers trot out the same kinds of argument about better teaching methods and pupils working harder to justify the ever-rising percentages of candidates receiving top grades. They look pretty foolish next to a critic holding up an 'A' level exam paper that pupils used to take before leaving school at 18 in one hand, and a first year university exam paper taken at 19 from a decade later with essentially the same question on it, or the equivalent with an old 'O' level paper that kids would have taken at 16 a generation ago with more demanding questions than an 'A' level paper kids take at 18 today.<p>You can only bury your head in the sand for so long before bad things start to happen, but successive governments who want everyone to be seen to succeed have been pushing the education establishment in this direction for a long time, and most of the teachers who knew better have retired by now. The only victims in this will be the children, and to some extent the new generation of teachers who are doing their best and perhaps do have some genuinely improved teaching methods to offer, yet who are perpetually vilified for being part of a system that is not their fault.<p><i>It's much safer for us to keep the government populated with vote-seeking politicians, and instead to turn out attention to where it should be, which is getting the solutions into the culture. If the electorate all want a particular change, then the politicians will make that change.</i><p>Unfortunately, the corrolation between vote-seeking behaviour and doing what the people collectively want isn't very strong in the current system. Here in the UK, we've been to <i>war</i> for a decade, a war that everyone saw coming and that brought literally millions onto the streets in protest, a war based on false evidence given by political leaders who have suffered little if any adverse consequences personally and who show no remorse for their actions. That's about as serious as it gets.<p>Of course, it's also against the law to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to your child in public, drive at 75mph on a completely clear motorway on Christmas morning, or smoke a joint in the privacy of your own home. I realise that the anti-Happy-Birthday lobby is a strong one, but that's going a little far. (And when the government did consult on fixing copyright, and close to 100% of the responses received from the public came down the same way on copyright term extension, Sir Cliff won anyway.)<p>There is a reason that ""campaign finance reform"" or whatever you call it locally is always on the political agenda but never gets anywhere. When all you have is an election every few years, and between elections there is no power of recall or ability to force a referendum on a single issue or other strong check on government authority, money talks louder than any concerned individual because a good campaign will win over enough less concerned individuals to make a bigger difference. And that's before you even get to our special kind of politics in Europe where if something isn't palatable to the national electorate you just kick it over to the unelected guys in Brussels, let them push through what you want, and then claim that the EU made you do it.<p>Did I mention that a lot of people are politically apathetic these days, because they don't feel their votes make a real difference? :-)",1335714436

Maybe some the things that you take for granted are not there, and some syntax is weird, and order of evaluation is strict left-to-right. (i.e. ""'x+1=2+3"" first computes 'not x', i.e. 0 or 1 if x=1 or x=0 respectively, then adds 1 to the result, then compares that result to 2, then adds 3 to that result, giving either 3 or 4 as a final answer).<p>but if you write controlled, sensible code, then it's actually not. certainly never my language of choice but it it's not just still used due to inertia... it's pretty fast, it makes database interaction easy, it's pretty easy to understand if the code isn't doing something awful like assuming variables and relying on hidden state. (which you can do, yes.)<p>if you're talking about the Daily WTF articles, then no it's not nearly as bad as those articles would imply. I worked for a company that is probably featured in one, but not all, of those articles... we had good tools, good coding standards/dev process, a good internal API/libraries that do quite a lot, and sensible people. Under these circumstances it was not bad--I'd actually grown quite fond of it. (No codebase of a large old company will be WTF-free but this isn't language-specific. I don't think any actual <i>code</i> from those Daily WTF articles actually comes from that company...)<p>Also, ""A Case of the MUMPS"" gets many things wrong.<p>'Scope of IF and FOR is ""remainder of current line.""' Nope. That's what 'do' is for.

Note that I'd actually write this as 'f i=1:1:100 d' and 'w ""string""' in place of ""for i=1:1:100 do"" and 'write ""string""'.

What it exports are basically COM objects with a bunch of extra CLR-style metadata.<p>COM avoids the C++ issue because it <i>only</i> allows you to consume interfaces, and, for all Windows compilers when COM was invented (and obviously since), vtables are always in a set location.  So the trick is:<p><pre><code>  1.  Never change existing interfaces
  2.  Always add new interfaces to the end of the vtables
</code></pre>
When you want a COM object, you instantiate it, but you don't work with it directly; you ask for the interface you want to use to talk to the object.  As long as the object vendor maintains the old virtual methods, the worst that happens is you ask for the old interface and everything works as normal.  This works very well with only a minor speed hit.<p>I think right after //build, I could tell you how they used CLR metadata to extend the system out to supporting subclassing, but I just honestly don't remember.  Similar general idea, though; they still avoid the problem by not actually hitting it.",1335712018

And in that sense the system is doing exactly what we want it to do: it's keeping out the infallibilists, the people who will advance their pet theories in spite of people on all sides pointing out the problems with it. No matter how well-intentioned those people are, it's a very bad idea to hand them the Big Stick of Government if they're going to keep wielding it when we want them to stop. And it's particularly bad if they intend to make sweeping changes - if we're going to be futzing with such powerful structures, we should be taking baby steps!<p>It's much safer for us to keep the government populated with vote-seeking politicians, and instead to turn out attention to where it should be, which is getting the solutions into the <i>culture</i>. If the electorate all want a particular change, then the politicians will make that change. And if they don't all want a particular change then we shouldn't be imposing it on them. And if they don't care, we should persuade them to - ""X doesn't affect you directly, but it will help us make Y cheaper for you"" can be effective. If the change really <i>does</i> make a better world for everyone - and not just advancing the interests of one group at the expense of another - then it should be possible to show them that.<p>I mean, heck, in the US there's an oil billionaire who funds billboards that just advertise ""being confident"" or ""having perseverance."" How cool is that? As cultural engineering goes it's pretty crude, but it's a damn good start.<p>And if your response to this post is ""but changing culture is practically impossible,"" then, well. I think you just found your lack of innovation ;-)",1335712014

Algorithms are problem-specific, but data structures (arrays/lists, trees, hashtables, graphs) are universal. If you get your data structured properly, in many cases it's of trivial importance which algorithm you use to operate on that data. I don't care about big-O performance beyond a back-of-the-envelope calculation. I don't care about someone knowing the ins-and-outs of A* search, but I do care if they've never heard of a graph. I care very much if I'm going to have to explain to you the difference between a hashtable and a list (as I did on Friday to one of our front-end engineers who thought he'd do some work on our API...).It's not a difficult gap in knowledge to fill, but it's an important one.",1335711917

3906129,comment,3903867,3905643,2,0,Silhouette,,,"You're quite right that the 11+ was a system that could be gamed, and people with lots of money would pay tutors to do it. One could make a similar argument about university admissions. However, it's also possible to pass the 11+ or get into Oxbridge or whatever academic ""elite"" measure you wish to use based on merit.<p>And it's not just about whether the school has more money. There have been plenty of government programmes over the years where schools could change their status in financially beneficial ways, and most if not all of them had nothing to do with being selective.<p>My concern is that academic ability tends to fit a bell curve. Most children will be somewhere near the middle, and will be able to progress at a similar pace. Towards <i>either</i> end of the bell curve, that stops working, and you need a more individually tailored approach to help each child maximise their potential. That's important to help children who have learning difficulties that can be at least partially overcome with one-on-one tuition, and it's just as important for children who are academically gifted but won't be able to take advantage of it or will even get bored and drop out if they aren't challenged at school. In recent years, there has been a lot of emphasis on special assistance for children with disadvantages, but it seems there's some sort of backlash against also trying to help children with advantages to make the most of them.<p>If you want a good way to stifle innovation within a society, holding back the smartest kids seems like a safe bet to me.<p>(In the interests of disclosure: I did go to grammar school and then study at Cambridge, and I did it without paying funny money to anyone. But I'm not really talking about me here, I'm thinking of a couple of friends who were far smarter than I ever was and who joined my school at 16. They had never really been challenged at their previous schools, perhaps because they were likely to get straight As anyway and there was no league table advantage in spending further resources on them. They caught up once they were working with teachers who were used to working with smart kids, but I've always wondered how many other kids didn't get in at either 11 or 16, never grew as much as they could have, never made it into the university they could have, and ultimately never received the education they deserved.)<p>Edit: Sorry, I forgot to address your other point:<p><i>And trade work isn't financially rewarding, that's a myth. The average wage of a plumber or electrician is 27k, bang on average wage. The only places they get 50K+ is in areas of shortage. I.e Rural Areas.</i><p>I think you're making my point for me there: in a generation when nearly half the population are coming out of education with a degree, a decent tradesman can still earn a comparable wage.<p>Also, since the trades are valuable practical skills, there is the chance to earn much more. There's a builder who's been buying up old places near where I live, knocking them down, rebuilding them with his mates, and then selling the new places for a very healthy price. The guy our landlord sends to do maintenance work from time to time runs a couple of businesses doing different things, and from what he's said if he bundled everything in together they might have to register for VAT. The threshold for compulsory registration is something like 77k at the moment, and while that's based on revenue before taxes etc. are paid on it, it still translates to a very respectable salary. When we had an electrician out a few months ago, the cost for him and his apprentice to so some basic work came out at a higher hourly rate than I've ever earned but was consistent with what others had quoted for the job.<p>Not everyone in the trades is going to get rich, to be sure. But there are plenty of people in the trades who are earning a relatively good wage based on their practical skills. As long as they're doing a good job, I have no problem with that at all, by the way. But why mess around pushing them to study academic subjects they might have little interest in, when they could instead work as an apprentice learning a trade they enjoyed and were good at? How is a degree in some dubious subject from a new university going to help someone like that more than a couple of years working jobs with a more experienced partner and then maybe getting some industrial qualifications so they can take on more demanding (and better paid) jobs in their field?",1335711833

228446,comment,228233,228413,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>imo modern math requires years of study to reach the border of known.</i><p>You're right -- and modern mathematics requires more study than a field like computer science, simply because computer science as a field hasn't had enough time to accumulate very much content.  (This is one of the ideas I mentioned as floating around but not fully crystallized earlier.)<p>But this doesn't contradict what I was saying: My point was not about doing original research, but merely about crossing the threshold to being recognized as a prodigy.  A 13 year old attending university is certainly noticed -- but that doesn't mean he's doing original research (I didn't until I was 15).",1214477631
228445,comment,227587,227587,0,0,ihack4fun,,,"i think the root of all problems/evil in africa comes from lack of (bad.. very bad!) leaders. there's mugabe on one extreme and many other mini-mugabes who are ""sly"" enough to go unnoticed (they are not sly or clever or whatever but just downright stupid!), and worst of all, potentially ""good"" leaders will simply never get to lead because of the long queue of bad leaders waiting to get to the top and make themselves rich - and who , believe me , are ready to do anything to make sure that the ""good"" ones never lead - including murder.
kenyan example - yet its not the worst
1. MPs in kenya , one of the poorest countries in the world, take home AT LEAST 8000$ per month (it must be 10000$ by now) , much more than most rich countries. they vote for these salaries and block the parliament activities (hold hostage) if they dont get the amount they wanted - after all they are the law makers !.
2. Before elections, several women who wanted to become MPs we're beaten , raped etc.. in order to scare them. 
3. Now , after elections, with the hard times and especially after a near civil war situation ( also because of ""kenyan leaders greed for power"" - that's another long story !) , 
MP revenue taxation was proposed ( i had forgotten to mention they are not taxed ) - they we're obviously up in arms against it and vowed it would never happen - even if they earn 1000 times more than the average kenyan, who pays taxes.
i believe african countries have their share of talent ( intellectuals, artists, good leaders .. all what you want) only that they never (and might never) get to exercise it.
many africans know this so they simply have no faith in govt and live like they dont have them - which is more or less true, this means living in some very chaotic societies where the strong survive and the rest are left to try and survive.
let me cut it for now but if you can hack the bad leaders and replace them with good ones - maybe that might just be the hack of the century :)",1214477613

People are naturally interested in topics which touch on them directly -- this happens very frequently in medicine, where individuals having a particular disease frequently know far more about the disease than a general medical practitioner (but less than a specialist studying that disease, of course) -- so it's not unreasonable to think that a randomly selected genius is likely to have spent more time learning about the nature of genius than a random non-genius.",1214477237

228432,comment,228354,228354,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The classic book ""Flatland"" is a great read for anyone trying to wrap their mind around more than 3 dimensions. There was a sequel to the book written much later by another author, it was called ""Flatterland"" and I believe it touched on fractal and fractional dimensions and the like. However, I can't say how good it was because I didn't get through it.<p>Anyways, go read ""Flatland"" if you haven't had your mind blown this month.",1214475862

228430,comment,228233,228233,0,0,selva,,,"I just read 'A Mathematician's Apology' where Hardy touches on this at one point. If you want to consider someone's opinion on your question (besides cperciva), consider Hardy's (because he was a great mathematican and a brutally honest person). Briefly, Hardy thought the ability to make deep contributions to mathematics erodes after middle age. He cites Euler, Abel, Ramanujan, et al. Hardy mentions Gauss who was old (55, I think) when he made a major contribution but, Hardy notes, the idea for it had germinated while Gauss was young. I personally think Nature plays a bigger part than nurture when it comes to mathematical ability (of the rarer kind). Ramanujan is a classic example. He had pretty much no nurture. Way before anyone knew or cared, he was producing stunning mathematical insights.",1214475308

Why are you so eager to give away a piece of your company?<p>I'm seriously flabbergasted at the whole ""I need angel/VC money"" mentality. You don't need money, you need users and revenues. If you need money from someone else, that might be because you're burning cash and need a slightly longer runway. That's a decent reason to go fishing for investments. But it's definitely not a necessary step in any business.<p>Also, angel investors have no heart. They have wallets.

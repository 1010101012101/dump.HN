I should have switched careers five years earlier.<p>My advise to young scientists: define some aims and a time scale, and if you don&#x27;t meet them (i.e. get a tenured job), say good-bye.

7766968,comment,7765332,7766522,14,0,gone35,,,"I see you hold strong opinions (I am very critical of Soylent myself), but it might be wise to re-visit the evidence for some of your strongly-held assertions --otherwise you might end up misinforming others, and yourself.<p>For instance, what you say about &#x27;NEVER supplement[ing] with iron&#x27; is quite wrong. Iron deficiency anemia is quite common, especially for young women; and it is routinely treated by iron supplementation [1], even over-the-counter: if anything, iron&#x27;s bioavailability in adults is very low, and it is difficult to exceed safe levels (although it&#x27;s the opposite for children) [2].<p>Also Vitamin D2 is <i>not</i> useless at all. Even though <i>some</i> recent studies have shown <i>some</i> limited evidence that D3 is stronger and longer-acting; decades of clinical practice have shown the safety and efficacy of high-dose D2 in treating severe vitamin D deficiency [3]. It&#x27;s disingenuous to say otherwise.<p>And... what you say about Vitamin K1 vs K2 is also far from well-established. Putting aside the fact that actual clinical vitamin K deficiency is extremely rare in the first place, K1 is the most commonly used form for a reason: even though there has been some recent work indicating possible differences in bioavailability and function on the part of K2; current knowledge is still very limited, and there is not enough evidence to displace K1 as the main formulation approved for dietary supplements [1,2].<p>I could go on and on with other inaccuracies in what you said, but you get the idea.<p>Also be careful with overdoing that liver with onions habit. Even though animal river is very rich in iron and copper (which likely explains part of how you feel after eating it); it also happens to contain high amounts of vitamin A in retinoid (retinol) form, which as you correctly point out should be taken in moderation due to their much higher bioavailability <i>vis a vis</i> carotenoids, thus increasing its potential toxicity [7].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_supplement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_supplement</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/iron-supplements?page=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guid...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/589256_4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/589256_4</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ilsi.org/Europe/Documents/Menaquinones%20and%20human%20health.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ilsi.org/Europe/Documents/Menaquinones%20and%20hu...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/nda_op_ej822_vit_k2_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/nda_op_ej822_vit_k2_...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_(food)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_(food)</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A#Equivalencies_of_retinoids_and_carotenoids_.28IU.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A#Equivalencies_of_reti...</a>",1400500341

I had reason to use Python for some code quite recently, and it reminded me of how much better ML-derived languages are.<p>The things I found awful about Python compared to OCaml:<p>- Lots of bugs which are never noticed, even at run time, eg. along error paths.  &#x27;pylint&#x27; helps here, but it doesn&#x27;t catch all the bugs, and IMHO if you need a lint tool to fix your language you&#x27;re doing it wrong in the first place.<p>- Really hard to refactor code.  In OCaml the compiler helps refactoring -- you just break something and hit &#x27;make -k&#x27; until you&#x27;ve fixed all the places that need fixing.  In Python you have to visually grep all the code, which doesn&#x27;t scale and is bug-prone.<p>- I miss nested variable declarations.<p>- Poor support for data types.  Python in theory has lots, but in practice everyone&#x27;s using dictionaries and objects, which are unsafe and introduce bugs by design.<p>- Slow.  Really slow.<p>There were a few good aspects of Python, but I ended up with a lot of buggy code, and I know there are many more bugs in there which I haven&#x27;t yet found, which just wouldn&#x27;t be the case with a statically typed, type-inferenced ML-derived language.",1400499001

This creates a lot of overhead with large groups. What you can do instead is to delegate your trust to, say, a key member of the group - if they trust every member, so do you.

So while you can convert stuff in the ground to cash in hand, what you <i>haven&#x27;t</i> done is to increase your total wealth.  You&#x27;ve exchanged your physical stock for financial purchasing power.<p>You can use those stocks to create more value, but in the case of energy tend to consume it in the process (materials can often be recycled).<p>You can look at the economic value created by a quantity of energy -- I&#x27;ve done some exploration of this in terms of $billion GDP/quad (quadrillion BTU energy) or $/barrel:  <a href=""http://redd.it/1vlksg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/1vlksg</a><p>One way of considering a barrel of oil is in how much economic benefit you get from it.  In various countries:<p>US:  $1022<p>China:  $528<p>Japan: $1678<p>Syria:  $498<p>Egypt:  $441<p>India:  $493<p>Germany:  $1465<p>UK: $1586<p>Switzerland:  $2792<p>Mali:  $4425<p>Note that industrialized nations tend to get $1000+ per barrel, nonindistrialized ones (Mali excepted) $400-500 or so.  Oil&#x27;s been running around $100 - $120/bbl the past couple of years.<p>That  means the US sees about $9 in returns for each dollar spent on oil, Switzerland nearly $27.  Mali sees a large nominal return, but both its GDP and oil consumption are minuscule.<p>Egypt&#x27;s in much worse shape:  $3.41 in returns per oil dollar spent.  India&#x27;s slightly better ($3.93), China a bit above that ($4.82).  But all are running on pretty thin margins.  Increased oil prices will push a lot of marginal uses out of reach, and likely shrink their economies markedly.  Note that Egypt and Syria in particular are two nations undergoing pronounced unrest -- and which have also recently gone from net exporters to importers of oil.  This is a transition described by the Export-land model (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Land_Model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Land_Model</a>).<p>Yes, increasing your efficiency of energy use is one way to increase wealth, but accessing more (or cheaper) energy is another route.

They may not directly oppress the societal group attempting to take action against the perceived oppression.<p>Also, oppression is not war.  War is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of political violence or intervention.<p>You are wrong to say that war exists because of oppressors.

In a normal firewall, you&#x27;d block e.g. port 80 from IP x.x.x.x. In an appliction firewall you simply block, for instance, bittorrent traffic. Minimal user interaction required, and where it is required, it&#x27;s very easy to use.<p>* HTTPSB: A low-level web browser firewall (&quot;block port 80 from IP x.x.x.x) that now also does (better) adblocking. The adblocking is on par with Adblock (plus): no user action required. The browser &quot;firewall&quot; is basically unusable.

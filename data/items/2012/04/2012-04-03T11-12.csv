Basically, reply to the C&D letter with a written letter of your own (make sure you get proof of delivery on the postage; keep a copy for your files; etc.). Your letter should be as polite and as brief as possible, because any extraneous language can and will be used against you. If you write something that <i>can</i> be misinterpreted, it's a safe bet that it will be.<p>Basically, your letter should: a) acknowledge receipt of their letter, b) state your non-affiliation with and non-operation of the offending service. And that's it. Just the facts. No editorialization. No defensiveness. No snide remarks. No theories about how or why they came to think you were involved, and how they are mistaken, etc. And avoid the temptation to get cute or cheeky. Don't poke the bear.<p>IF they reply to your reply -- which they very well may not -- then you should lawyer up. If you want to be super cautious, you can consult a lawyer, and probably pay a fair bit of coin in so doing, to draft your initial reply letter.",1333454154

How would you tell the difference?  Well, one can imagine creating a histogram of the bits for each half of the bytes and comparing them to expectations based on the distribution of bits in naturally occurring English text.  The half with most of the entries in the 0x5, 0x6, and 0x7 is the upper order half.<p>If you don't know what naturally occurring e.g. Japanese looks like in Unicode code points, take this on faith: flipping the order does not give you a document which looks probably correct.  (Also, crucially, Japanese with the order flipped doesn't resemble any sensible document in any language -- you end up with Unicode code points from a mishmash of unrelated pages.)<p>P.S. Why care about that algorithm?  Here's a hypothetical: you're a forensic investigator or system administrator who, given a hard drive which has been damaged, need to extract as much information as possible from it.  The BOM is very possibly not in the same undamaged sector which you are reading right now, and it may be impossible to stitch the sectors without first reading the text.  How would you determine a) whether an arbitrary stream of bytes was likely a textual document, b) what the encoding was, c) what endianness it was, if appropriate, and d) what human language it was written in?",1333454154

So, are you saying ""If I started using my real name as my Internet handle, I would be anonymous""? Or ""...because many other people with the same name will also do so, any minute now""?<p>In my opinion, false and false: you'd effectively 1) make your identity your pseudonym, and 2) as such, would be trivially cross-linked to your RL identity, even if (and that's a huge if) thousands of people were using the same real name as you are.<p>In my case, there are actually hundreds of people using the same real name as I am - yet, it is quite obvious which one is which, from the way the identities are linked together (e.g. many of my profiles share the same picture of me, my professional profiles all list the same experiences, my location, etc. etc.).

One of the sites I run exists by donations, and just for giving this advice 1 person donated 100 to the running of the site because in his words ""No-one else is telling me to encrypt or helping me."".<p>The big glaring omission in all of this is email. We all want a secure email system, and one that doesn't involve locking yourself into a single provider (Hushmail), and yet can co-exist with sending email to recipients on webmail and corporate solutions.<p>Talk about a big hole in the market.<p>I've not pitched this to my users as ""here's how to pirate"", it's just been ""privacy is core to democracy, encryption protects your privacy"". And additionally I've argued to them that if they were amongst the people who turned their Twitter avatars green last year for Iran, then by not using encryption they leave encryption to ""terrorists, criminals and dissidents"", who cares for the first two, but if you care for the last you'll encrypt too to ensure that their dissenting opinion can be voiced safely in private.<p>I got the idea for telling my users all of this from HN, and specifically a link to a Canadian site:<p><a href=""http://encrypteverything.ca/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://encrypteverything.ca/index.php/Main_Page</a><p>Then I also shared links to:<p><a href=""https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere</a><p><a href=""https://www.relakks.com/?lang=eng"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.relakks.com/?lang=eng</a><p><a href=""https://ssd.eff.org/tech/encryption"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ssd.eff.org/tech/encryption</a><p>I truly think that the best response that the people of Britain can give to these proposals is to encrypt everything and take away from the government the ability to pervasively spy on their own populace like this.<p>With most governments and corps it always feels like that ask for a mile, and when we object they concede half a mile. We're happy, but then they do this a few times and they get to where they wanted to be.<p>What better way to halt this for good than to encrypt everything.<p>Now, if someone could just give us email v2, secure by default.

3792504,comment,3791431,3791799,4,0,Carlfish,,,"Not entirely accurate (IANALTINLA also). It comes down to the commonly confused distinction between the burden of proof and the standard of proof.<p>""Proof beyond reasonable doubt"" is the criminal _standard_ of proof, while the standard for civil cases is generally stated as balance of probabilities (but is a little more complicated than that)<p>The _burden_ of proof, on the other hand, is pretty much the same between criminal and civil cases. It's the plaintiff or prosecution's responsibility to prove their case, and if they can't do that to the standard required by law they lose. The defendant is under no obligation to do anything more than point out the flaws in the plaintiff's case.<p>Sometimes, though, the burden of proof shifts the other way. This usually happens when the defendant offers some kind of ""affirmative defence"". For example, if a defendant wanted to argue that a (civil) contract or a (criminal) confession was invalid because of duress, it would be up to the defence to produce evidence that this duress occurred. They could not just float the possibility of duress and force the prosecution/plaintiff to produce evidence that disproves it.",1333453621

I'm not trying to argue with you, you're right that I only have a superficial overview of the Java/JVM/J2EE ecosystem, but I will try to elaborate on the points of my original post, which was rather sparse, I admit.<p>As I read Wikipedia, HotSpot is opensource. I'm not sure if that includes the best JIT compiler (what the JVM is known for) as well, or if that's still closed/proprietary, but I'd be pleasantly surprised if it's open source as well. Still, we have the patents issue, i.e. the current legal battle between Google and Oracle. Releasing the source but suing anyone who uses it is not the way to do open source, IMGO (true, the source was release by Sun, and Oracle is the one who's suing, but still).<p>I believe that a general purpose programming language (suitable for business applications) has to be able to perform as well as C for heavily optimized code. What I mean is that you have to be able to write algorithms that run very fast. You can probably do that with C# (supports unboxed structs) and maybe even Objective-C (supports MemoryPools, and method lookup caching), but not Java (AFAIK). Sure, you can always link to external C libraries, but then you have to face dependency hell and portability issues.<p>The issue that I see with Java's concurrency model is not that it is not powerful enough, but that it is <i>too</i> powerful. It allows synchronization on any heap-allocated object, which probably has a lot of overhead (used to be performance overhead, but HotSpot was heavily optimized for that, so after a lot of programmer-hours overhead, the performance overhead was lowered). However, I think that this kind of threading model is not scalable to massively parallel/distributed environments. Synchronization/sharing will have to be limited, e.g. as in Erlang/WebWorkers/Rust, using GCD in Objective-C, using MVar (Haskell) or transactional variables (Clojure). Java probably can never do that, without sacrificing backwards compatibility.<p>Lack of support for functional programming was meant more on the JVM level. There are no tail calls, no fast object allocation, no true polymorphism, and I'm guessing that since closures have to be represented as objects, they are not particularly cheap.",1333451946

It's called the ""multipotentiality"" problem. (<a href=""http://www.tip.duke.edu/node/784"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tip.duke.edu/node/784</a>). Essentially, the problem is that those with the aptitude for, and interest in, a number of diverse disciplines -- typically, gifted individuals -- may suffer from an inability to choose one path over the others, or to stick with any given path long enough to truly master it. Additionally, they tend to suffer from an occasionally crippling form of regret over the paths they didn't take.

I certainly don't <i>blame</i> Red Hat and I was very careful to avoid saying that Red Hat was obligated to donate anything to anyone, since I agree with you that they are not.<p>Obviously my intent was not well-communicated in my comment. I apologize, but I don't really know how to make it better. :-(<p>With all that said, those words still ring a bit hollow for me. If the person giving dimes to the homeless were to say, ""hey, I wasn't <i>obligated</i> to donate <i>anything</i> to them,"" that still doesn't quite ameliorate the sheer numerical discrepancy, which is still the point where my brain goes, ""wait... what?""<p>Another comment did: it said, ""oh, they're just talking about revenues, not profits."" That's a much more important distinction. If Red Hat's costs are very high, then it might not be four dimes but four $100 bills. That's a much more substantial donation given what you got.",1333451780

Any server OS will cache ""hot"" files in RAM, so in day-to-day use the difference between nginx serving up static files from disk, or hitting memcached is pretty minimal - it's just a question of which part of the stack is caching your content in RAM.

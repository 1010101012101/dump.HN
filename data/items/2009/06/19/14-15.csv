665214,comment,663662,663662,0,0,Ardit20,,,"I was a bit disappointed seeing this list tbh. I thought wow cool before getting there and once I landed I was like, gee dude, love to learn?<p>I think the people who love to learn have a big problem, that is there is so many interesting things that we would love to learn, hence a list like this, although to start with was met with, well why should I have this guy tell me what to read, but I thought I might get some cool book, you know one of those which changes the way you think.<p>For me, there have been a few books which have changed the way I think, as they were at different stages of my life, their difficulty rating varies.<p>The first book to change my way of thinking is ""a beginners guide to ideas"". I suggest this book as a present for smart, but deeply devoted religious people. This is a very ""basic"" book and mostly introduces a beginner to the history of philosophy.<p>The second book, in a time line order, would be (I do not remember the title exactly) something like WWI and why it happened. This book undercovered the deeper reasons and explained how the surface stories connect with them.<p>I think the winner would have to be a book about Nitzches works, the different way that this guy saw reality, I think shed some light on our nature and some deeper hidden reasons for things like morality.<p>A designers book for non designers was just superb, simple, yet deep.<p>Now am reading ancient rhetorics for contemporary students which is helpful for me right now for its emphasise on thoroughness which I had ignored.<p>Another book was about the complete history of human beings, which taught me that we prefer to improve what we have, therefore lay layer upon layer, and by association create immense complexity, when there are much more simple ways of doing things. The examples were the ancient calendars and their numerical systems.<p>I could go on, however what I think these books have in common is one, they introduce you to a completely new field of study, two they are written by people who taught the subject for years, hence they know how to teach, how many and which basic things to include and at what pace to progress to complexity. Another thing they have in common is that these books get lost haha, even their titles, however they do remain in my memory and what I have learned from them will probably be taken to the grave.<p>An egocentred opinion may follow, however I would suggest that the people who love to learn love to learn many things, yet not necessarily in great detail, that is what specialism and our job is for. Therefore I was enthusiastic by this list, yet very disappointed by it content.",1245423224

It seems silly to punish her for a systematic feature of the software she used to download the tracks.<p>I dunno - it seems that if we're going to punish her for sharing as well, do we then not go after those 7-8 people that downloaded from her?  Seems like there's a bit of double-dipping that's possible here (which again would lead to an Infinite amount of damages).<p>But i'll give you that.  We're now at $8-$10 a track.

This is also a good motivation to follow an agile methodology, where you deliver value early and often.",1245421469

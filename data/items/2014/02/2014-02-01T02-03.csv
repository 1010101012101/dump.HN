They had plenty of problems whose primary cause was the absence of cooling water (including a hydrogen gas explosion), but there was never an uncontrolled criticality because of it. (Also see further comments below on criticality.)<p><i>I am talking about short-term &quot;everyone evacuate the building&quot; types of disaster scenarios. You can do precisely that with a LFTR because of the passive decay heat cooling combined with the loss of criticality that happens when the freeze plug melts.</i><p>Ok, this makes it clearer where you are coming from. I certainly agree that the LFTR is a big improvement over the standard PWR design.<p><i>We don&#x27;t really even know how bad the damage can get.</i><p>It&#x27;s true that Chernobyl could have been worse, so we can&#x27;t really judge the worst case from what happened there. However, these worst-case scenarios have been simulated in great detail; the physics is actually pretty simple.<p>With any design that isn&#x27;t Soviet-built, a loss of coolant will not cause an uncontrolled criticality; losing coolant decreases the reaction rate, causing loss of criticality. The problem with the Chernobyl design was that it had a &quot;positive void coefficient of reactivity&quot;, meaning that the reaction rate increased on loss of coolant. That feature, as I said, is <i>not</i> present in any non-Soviet design, which means it&#x27;s not present in any commercial design currently operating (since all the old Soviet reactors have been shut down).<p><i>I just REALLY don&#x27;t like the idea of the balancing act that has to be performed in 1 and far prefer the kind of intrinsic safety that you get from 2.</i><p>So do I. Now that we have such designs, we should certainly be building them, and should not be building the old designs that lack those passive safety features.",1391223203

I have personally never made a front end framework or released any sort of open source project, so it is cool that you have done that. All I am really trying to say is there is a tradeoff between file size and what a framework can offer.<p>You have chosen to go the smallest possible file size route, which is cool, but I would never use it in it&#x27;s current state. The page advertises support for IE5.5 and it shows. It looks like something that was developed when IE5.5 was around. It is easy to support a single text input in IE5, but try building out a complex form in CSS and see what happens in old IE. Also, nothing looks finely polished. I just see a bunch of colored rectangles filled with text. There are no examples of typography beside the header tags. The padding\\margins on buttons and alerts look funny. The forms are completely lacking. There is an issue with the navbar where the entire thing slides up a pixel or two when the dropdowns appear. The icons are just standard unicode characters that really have little use on the web and look dated. Again, I don&#x27;t mean to knock your framework, I just think it needs a bit of polish and it is unfair to say it offers most of what bootstrap does. I&#x27;d also highly recommend you put normalize in there.<p>I&#x27;ll defiantly keep an eye out for version 2! Good luck!",1391223106

7160592,comment,7159398,7159398,15,0,throwawaykf03,,,"This is why I hate Internet reporting of patent cases:<p><i>> Given that there&#x27;s no question Internet broadcasting pre-dated Logan&#x27;s business, Ars asked if Liddle and his colleagues at Personal Audio felt that it was justifiable to keep pursuing small podcasters for royalty payments. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to comment on that,&quot; he said.</i><p>1) The patents are not on &quot;Internet broadcasting&quot;. They are, effectively, despite claim oversimplification being the primary sin in discussing patents, on <i>skipping episodes of audio content</i>. That is <i>it</i>. If you want to find relevant prior art, you don&#x27;t go about looking for &quot;Internet broadcasting&quot;, you look for things that involve <i>audio content</i> that is <i>episodic</i> and can be <i>skipped</i> from episode to episode with a user command. Yes, really.<p>2) The prior art that EFF dug up, if it is indeed on &quot;Internet broadcasting&quot;, is probably not relevant to this patent.<p>3) Personal Audio is arguing Estoppel. Estoppel, overly simplified, means what you say and do can be used against you.<p>4) If you consider 2) and 3) it&#x27;s highly ironic then, that Ars asks the lawyer a question that would effectively do nothing other than create estoppel for himself. Conveniently, the article gets to present that as a shady response. But consider this: whatever he may say offhand about the prior art Ars mentioned can work against him. This is the same principle as &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to the police&quot; that gets parroted so often around here: Don&#x27;t say <i>anything</i> without having thoroughly thought it through beforehand. As an oversimplified example: The lawyer may have said something like &quot;That is just Internet broadcasting. This patent covers something else like skipping episodes&quot;. An opposing lawyer can then argue, &quot;Defendant does Internet broadcasting, but plaintiff&#x27;s lawyer just implied these patents don&#x27;t cover Internet broadcasting.&quot;<p>5) Askpatents.com is much better for this work, because dedicated users (shoutout to Micah Siegel) take efforts to describe in plain english and as precisely as possible, the claims and what prior art should contain. Anything less than that devolves (as it does on HN or Slashdot) to discussions of completely irrelevant prior art.<p>6) Relevant prior art may actually lie in the domain of simple digital audio players, because those have had skipping of content for, like, <i>ever</i>. Problem is, these claims use &quot;means for doing XYZ&quot; in their language. This, while sounding extremely broad, is paradoxically narrow, because &quot;means for&quot; is now interpreted to cover only exactly the methods described in the specification. But anything that skipped episodes of content is what we want.<p>While I am strongly pro-patent, I completely accept there are flaws in the system. The article implies the patents are overbroad, but the reality is they are narrow enough to be literally inconsequential, but impart an over-inflated worth because of the legal environment.<p>However, reporting like this twists the issues and actually <i>impedes</i> progress. If, for example, you called your Congress-people (hah!) and complained saying &quot;How can there be a patent on Internet broadcasting?!&quot;, they would consult with someone who actually knows <i>how patents worked</i>, who would then say, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s not really a patent on Internet broadcasting per se...&quot;, and that&#x27;s all the politician needs to bucket you in along with the old lady who keeps calling up about the UFOs in her backyard.<p>OK, I&#x27;m stretching it with the politician scenario and have no experience with politics.

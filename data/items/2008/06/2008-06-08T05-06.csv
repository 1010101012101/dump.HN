The interesting things in web apps are those that leverage the web itself.

It was not created by happenstance and eventually adopted as good just because it was old. If it's getting them into trouble now, it's not because it was a poorly designed logo, just that it was poorly designed for the purpose of being a favicon.<p>I won't speak to whether or not Ruth Kedar would qualify as a great designer in everyone's eyes, but I would say being anything other than a Google engineer with a passing interest in logo design would be enough to support my point.",1212902781

(I don't mean ""emotional"" as a criticism, though I realize it probably sounds that way.) The problem is that it's a moving target. For example, the objection that ""exponential advances in hardware are not matched by exponential advances in software, so extrapolation from the former doesn't apply to the latter,"" is met with something like, ""You are uninformed if you think The Singularity has to do with extrapolation from Moore's Law. That's a common misunderstanding."" One wonders how the misunderstanding got so common if that's not what the advocates said! Anyway, this moving-targetness is to me an indicator of religious attachment to a concept.",1212902238

211929,comment,211696,211902,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's not a religion in any complete sense, but it's kind of obvious that a gigantic leap of faith is involved (starting with the use of the definite article in the phrase ""The Singularity"", as was shrewdly pointed out by a recent commentator here), and I do think the leap can fairly be called religious. Why?<p>First, despite what you and others say about ""empiric evidence"", Moore's Law doesn't at all imply a concomitant leap in programming power (is <i>our</i> capacity growing exponentially?), and extrapolation from actual achievements to date points in a decidedly more mundane direction.<p>Second, the ""singularity"" predictions are the latest in a tradition of extravagant millenarian claims that people have been making about AI for decades. These claims have consistently turned out to be overblown, if not vacuous, in retrospect. Extrapolate from <i>that</i> historical trend and you arrive at quite a different (and rather more plausible) picture.<p>Third and most interestingly, the emotions and language surrounding the ""singularity"" are distinctly religious. This really stands out in what I've seen of the discourse. Since many advocates of ""singularity"" are of an intellectual cast that objects to the more popular religions, it seems to me as if some are directing their religious impulses into technology. As someone brilliantly says in the OP, it's ""The Rapture For Nerds"". (Notice that definite article again.)<p>By the way, I don't mean ""religious"" as a criticism per se. Personally, I think religious impulses are part of being human. What fascinates me about The Singularity discourse is the incongruence between its technological subject matter and its vividly religious emotional language.",1212901257

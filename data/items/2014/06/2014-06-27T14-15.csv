Many of these tests were for obscure cluster failure cases using custom bleeding-edge test frameworks. So the answer is no, I didn&#x27;t write any test at Google interview, it wasn&#x27;t required.<p>How can you prove you can code in a team during an one-on-one interview? At best you can give hints that you are willing to discuss stuff and change your progress on input from the interviewer and explore if there is any sort of chemistry between you two, which is about all you can do.<p>I really hate this kind of nitpicking, averaging everyone to a &quot;normal&quot; level, trying to find something wrong in someone because she or he goes against (IMO) lazy typical stereotype.

Or are we slowing down in a sense, and picking all the low-hanging fruit we can, as a result focusing more on finance and short-term &#x27;app lotteries&#x27; that we build on top of the mobile duopoly?<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting thought: the emergence of the &#x27;sharing economy&#x27; (AirBnB, Lyft, etc) as a way to provide value and earn profits through efficiency, probably came about because there was little innovation happening in the fundamental fields in which they were born (housing and automobiles, respectively). To be clear, this is not necessarily a bad thing - in fact, it&#x27;s definitely a net positive. But you might imagine being a bit worried when we start doing this with our computer devices (say, perhaps, some scheme in which we share processing cycles on devices not being used) because it means our compute devices are fundamentally not getting better as they&#x27;ve been.",1403881144

Other departments would send him requests for information about certain individuals, and his job was to send them the data that they required, but only that data, to prevent other departments from intentionally or inadvertently accessing the wrong data (and violating privacy laws).<p>So his day consisted of getting an e-mail with a request for data X about person Y, and then sending them that data. A fairly straightforward task, but when he was hired there was a three-month backlog.<p>After a week or two, he wrote an application in VB that would access the database directly; he could type in a name, choose a result, select fields, generate a PDF, and e-mail it to a given e-mail address. What used to be a 5-10 minute job became a 30 second job. His three-month backlog turned into a three-month headway. People were getting their results within minutes of sending the request, rather than hours, days, or weeks, and productivity everywhere increased.<p>At this point, his job consisted of sitting at his desk watching anime on his netbook until a request came in, typing for a few seconds, clicking a button, then watching anime again.<p>He was bored constantly; he asked his boss for more work, something else to do, automation or paperwork or anything, but his boss refused. Union job, defined role, can&#x27;t give you more work.<p>Haven&#x27;t talked to him in ages.

I was a support person for printers and I one day overheard some grumbling by someone who was collating ink cartridge information.<p>Apparently they had &quot;modified&quot; a clipper database and added new records, but it was one record per file, with each field delimited by new line and field/values in ini format (key=value). They were opening each file in notepad, then copying each value into a spreadsheet. They had over 20,000 thousand files^H^H^H^H^H records, needless to say this took a long time to compile the excel file which they used for reporting. Like 9 weeks long.<p>I was mucking around with Perl at the time, and I casually mentioned this is what Perl is good for, I got this skeptical look, so I said I&#x27;d prove it. They gave me 100 sample files, and then I spent some time using file globbing and some regexes to split out the data. Whilst I was about it, I fiddled with hashes and worked out how to use refs, mainly because I was a bit bored and learning some Perl concepts.<p>I then returned the next day with a working program, installed a Windows version of Perl, then copied the 10,000 records locally, ran my script, tweaked it, then emailed the guy the CSV file I created. The script took about 45 seconds to run (it was a bit inefficient).<p>I then walked over to the guy, asked him to open his email and watched his eyes bulge a little. I then walked to my desk and took some more calls about printers.<p>A few weeks later, I was surprised to discover I had been made employee of the quarter by Epson Australia.",1403880827

How is the API going to work?  What should I name this method?  As an industry we use to dedicate too much time to this (RUP, etc).  Now, we don&#x27;t think about it enough.<p>As far as actually improving code quality... not so much.  For the money, I would much rather see an hour of functional test development rather than an hour of unit test development (and I put TDD in the unit test category).  I think functional tests provide more value and our industry has put way too much emphasis on unit tests.<p>100% unit test coverage says nothing about code quality.  100% functional coverage does.

However, consider that your linked list is <i>already</i> a store of the contents of the list. Rather than copying values out, you may as well use the list itself.<p>If you could assume that the loop contains <i>all</i> members of the list, then you could detect the loop by iterating through the list and checking to see if the node is the same as the head of the list. Unfortunately, the loop doesn&#x27;t always point back to the head of the list, so you may have something like this:<p><pre><code>  1 -> 2 -> 3\n       |    |\n       ^    \\/\n       5 <- 4\n</code></pre>\nBy maintaining two node references, and advancing one of them twice as quickly as the other, you are effectively doing the exact same check, but eliminating the problem that the loop may not include the head. In both tests, the separation between the two referenced nodes increases by one every time, but only in the second test is the &quot;head&quot; reference guaranteed to eventually be in the loop.",1403879653

7953939,comment,7953443,7953876,1,0,thegeomaster,,,"Implementing TLS securely owes its difficulty partly to the variety of ciphersuites and optional features that all need to be securely implemented. Building a simpler protocol which suites some specialized needs will make the number of ways in which you can screw up considerably smaller.<p>The StackOverflow answer you are linking to suggest hardcoding the server public key in the client (as was my idea) and then throwing away the whole server certificate. This means that the server wastes its precious time to send an X.509 certificate which the client will essentially discard (and it will add to the packet size, too). My protocol is currently very similar to TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 mentioned in the answer. I&#x27;m using RSA, AES-256 in CBC mode, and SHA-256 HMAC authentication. I&#x27;m thinking of maybe switching from AES-CBC+HMAC to AES-GCM, but modifications to the protocol won&#x27;t be hard if I get everything up and running smoothly.<p>I am, too, highly skeptical that I will come up with anything that is both faster and more secure than TLS. That&#x27;s why I am open-sourcing it and not even thinking about trying to profit from it. I&#x27;m doing this for my own satisfaction, and if that results in something that will help others, that would be even better.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with using TLS for secure communication in the client-server API case, but also with stuffing HTTP up there. This requires people to run a web server that will serve the API calls, and I conjecture that there is non-trivial overhead of the call going through the HTTP layer and getting dispatched to a script interpreter. And the cost is twofold because the response must get back from the interpreter, to the HTTP layer, augmented with an ASCII header and sent back through the TLS layer to the client application.<p>As part of this, since the scripts on the server are PHP currently (but with an ability to change this fairly easily), I&#x27;m working on a more lightweight FastCGI alternative that sacrifices some of FastCGI&#x27;s aspects (such as running the FastCGI daemon on one host and calling into the scripts from another) but dispatching a request to a PHP instance (which I keep preforked, with a couple of spare ones, much like Apache does for its own processes) is essentially a zero-overhead operation.<p>I&#x27;m trying to be as secure as I can, attempting to mitigate timing and other side-channel attacks as much as vulnerabilities in the protocol itself. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m reusing a lot of the TLS ideas, but working in my own down there. I&#x27;m going to try to get trained cryptographers to review both the protocol and the code, but I don&#x27;t aim to provide any warranty.<p>I&#x27;m aiming to build a better solution not for TLS, but for secure HTTP RESTful APIs when the client can know server information beforehand. It&#x27;s a lot narrower use case and I think I can tackle it more effectively, and if it turns out to be a dead end, I&#x27;ll have some experience on my hands. And the server I&#x27;m building is highly modular, so some parts (especially the threadpooled libuv-based protocol-agnostic backend) may be reused later if deemed appropriate.",1403878067

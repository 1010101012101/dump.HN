285757,comment,285600,285742,0,0,ivank,,,"I somehow forgot about the true need to close a tab sometimes. This problem is much harder than I thought. But, one thing that I don't think will ever work is a large intermediate screen (as the mockup) as the primary method of switching tabs/pages. Most users (especially those on Windows) don't expect to see large intermediate screens (things like alt-tab are tiny). And I'm wary of two or more methods of switching, such as regular tabs plus the full-screen approach. It would kind of bring the full-screen method into an ""analytics"" category that most users would never use to their advantage. Is a full-screen tab switcher intended to be the primary method of switching?<p>The problem is especially tricky because users have already adapted their mental models of browsing to non-ideal tabs. This might require a very slow transition into an ideal navigation method. The ""find a tab using location bar"" approach is heading in the right direction.<p>I'm much more interested in improving the usability of existing horizontal (and vertical) tabs, since that's what users are used to. I don't have a compromise yet (if ever) but I would base it on these assumptions, which may not apply to everyone:<p>1) Just because a page has a tab, doesn't mean it needs to stay in memory (for most pages)<p>2) Keeping tabs, in-tab page history, and global history fragmented is <i>awful</i><p>3) Firefox's history pane is unusable, which partly accounts for tab proliferation (for many users - how many?)<p>As a side note, one of the reasons I like Tree Style Tabs is that it brings the webpage text closer to the center of the screen. As long as the screen is at least 1280 pixels wide, it's usually better for me. <i>edit</i>: but, it is kind of useless if the visual noise bothers you. It doesn't bug me; I like to see a lot of information on multiple monitors, as long as nothing changes in the background.",1219650686

I'm not sure that the incessant competition in this performance-pay model would be entirely conducive to retaining staff long-term. However, this may not be a big problem with unskilled industries where staff turnover is high anyway.",1219650376

But, ~$700 is better than new prices, and an Aeron is a solid choice.  There are only a few chairs in the same league and none that are significantly cheaper or as universally available.",1219648603

285743,comment,285615,285615,0,0,DaniFong,,,"<i>People have more time for leisure activities in the year 2008. The average work day is about four hours. But the extra time isn’t totally free. The pace of technological advance is such that a certain amount of a jobholder’s spare time is used in keeping up with the new developments, on the average, about two hours of home study a day.</i><p>Intriguingly, this is probably true. The difference is that 'home study of new developments' actually just takes place at work, and the 8 hour workday is still going strong, if only as an illusion.<p>The pattern seems to be that the predictions for technology, especially anything requiring complicated physics or engineering, are wildly inaccurate, while the predictions for social, organizational, or behavioral change are either on the money, or too conservative.<p>Since consumer programs are usually meant to aid existing behaviors, the authors predictions don't overshoot the mark by nearly so much.<p>Sometimes, social institutions are completely ignored as subjects of change.<p>""Other conveniences ease kitchenwork. The housewife simply determines in advance her menus for the week, then slips prepackaged meals into the freezer and lets the automatic food utility do the rest. At preset times, each meal slides into the microwave oven and is cooked or thawed. The meal then is served on disposable plastic plates. These plates, as well as knives, forks and spoons of the same material, are so inexpensive they can be discarded after use.""<p>How quaint. What on earth is said 'the housewife' supposed to do? <i>not be a housewife</i>, perhaps?",1219647670

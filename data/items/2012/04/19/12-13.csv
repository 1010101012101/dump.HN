Culture and genetics might cause political borders to be where they are, but they are also caused and reinforced by where political borders happen to be. (The law makes it difficult for you to travel to America => You're unlikely to be immersed in American culture or marry an American => Your culture and genetics remain very distinct from American culture and genetics => People see no need to facilitate travel to America => Repeat cycle.)<p>So if borders and border control policies changed, the boundaries of cultural and genetic heritage will follow suit, and vice versa. This means you can't just appeal to existing cultural boundaries to argue for some sort of nationalism that perpetuates said boundaries. So although I agree with you that borders aren't completely ""imaginary"", they're not completely real and static, either.",1334840146

And if you are starting a tech company dont model it after a factory.<p>Im a fan of Hacker News, but I view it from afar. Its like a strange other world and Im just a voyeur. Im a tech entrepreneur, but I live outside of the US. Im not trying to bump my valuation to get bought out by a giant. But a lot of great information is shared on Hacker News, and I like you guys, even if I dont always understand you. :-)<p>The 501 manifesto and the anti 501 response strike me as really amusing. I know where the 501ers are coming from. I used to be a coder in the trenches. I also understand the anti-ish response, because as soon as you write a manifesto people will come running to trash it. Its just a risk you take when you write a manifesto. And now here I am to tell you that you are both wrong. And dammit that puts me dangerously close to writing my own manifesto.<p>What you are experiencing is the death throes of the industrial era factory worker mentality that has been carried over to an office worker mentality and stretched to the point of ridiculousness when applied to knowledge workers.<p>The vast majority of you are knowledge workers. Highly skilled (we hope), well trained, creative problem solvers. You are paid to solve problems with code. You are craftsmen and artisans yet you are being used like no skill, brain dead, button pushing assembly line workers.<p>You will sit in the cube and be creative from 9am to 10:30am, then you will stop being creative and be attentive while we have a meeting on something inane for an hour and a half. You will then go eat lunch and return to your cube on time to commence with the creativity again. Ignore your dumb ass coworkers that are still playing high school games. Ignore the weird lighting and the noise. Ignore the distractions. Be creative dammit. Oh and by the way we own you, your free time is ours, anything you create is ours, and our needs come before your family and loved ones.<p>To me it looked like you had two choices: Care a lot about whatever the company is/does, sacrifice yourself and burn out doing everything you can to support it, or give up, just become the factory worker, do a fine job and punch out at 5:01.<p>But I decided to go a different way. I decided to scrap the factory worker mentality all together. Think about the best work you have ever done, I bet it wasnt in the office. For me it was always either hunched over my laptop at 3am or at a coffee shop kicking around ideas with other people. Now that I am the guy making the decisions why was I falling into the same trap that everyone else falls into, even though I know its a trap? Because its safer. If I did it like everyone else and failed you cant blame me, right? Fuck that. I want the best work I can get from my crew. Not the best work I can get between the hours of 9 and 5 while surrounded by distractions. I am an idiot before 10am but on fire from midnight to three am. Why would I force myself to do important things at 9:30 am? One of my business partners is best from 6am to early afternoon and then becomes useless. Why dont we as a business and development culture pay attention to these things? Because we are hanging on to some outdated industrial era assembly line ideal. Henry Ford wanted conformity so his people were as interchangeable as his parts. But the difference between one factory workers output and anothers probably only varies by ten percent. My best work is so much better than my worst work that its worth building a new system to get as much of my best work as possible. The same goes for you.<p>I started with myself. I stopped going to the office. I started working in the places I was most comfortable. I started paying attention to when I was creative, when I was distracted, when I was effective. I took notes. I watched my output and then I remade my life around it. Guess what? It worked. That time in the afternoon that I used to find myself distracted and on facebook or mindlessly surfing, I now spend that time with my kids at the park. The hour and a half that I am answering emails and arranging my schedule each day, I do that while having coffee with my wife. You know that line between WORK and LIFE I just took it away. Guess what? My life got better. I was happier, my family was happier, and my output was higher quality.<p>So I did the same for the people that worked for me. It isnt easy. Some people have been trained their whole lives to be factory workers without knowing it. It is really hard for them to give up that crutch. But when they get it they do better work and are happier people. And as the boss thats exactly what I want.",1334838691

It starts at the root node, and at each branching, asking itself: which following move is the best mixture of good (based on MC games I've played on the leaf nodes of its children) and unknown (ie I haven't explored that branch very much yet). It does that at every node until the leaf, where it expands a node with the MC-simulator (and then propagates the result up the tree). So unlike some other tree-search algorithms, it isn't cobbled by having to expand all paths to a certain depth before exploring a particular sequence deeper. The result literally looks like a tree: some branches are really tall, maybe 18 moves deep, while others are really short.

People can be bound together by land and heritage without having had the idea of nations or national borders.<p>Also, while the walls that are put along the imaginary lines may have a reality to themselves, the lines are much more fluid and are unbound to the physical items that represent them. Hadrian's wall is still marking the northern extent of the old Roman Empire, however the current border between England and Scotland is much further north and is represented by nothing other than the occasional sign and line of paint and for the vast majority of the length of this line has no indication on the ground of its actual whereabouts.<p>[edit] And as far as loyalty goes, loyalty is independent of patriotism and is perfectly capable of transcending geography.",1334838094

The CEO, the Board, and that's about it. Almost nobody below the C-level has any direct incentive to keep payroll costs manageable.<p>At the management level, the manager -- who bears no personal cost for managing N+1 workers instead of just N workers, will almost always choose N+1 if given the option. <i>He</i> doesn't pay their salaries, after all, and to him, the increased headcount is a status symbol. It's also something he will convince himself he actually needs. (You never hear middle managers complaining that their divisons are overstaffed, but the opposite complaint is almost universal).<p>This is what's known as an ""agency problem."" Many (most?) of the agents of the greater whole (the company) have personal incentives that work at odds with the company's greater incentives. This clash of incentives leads to waste, bloat, inefficiency, and so forth, because almost nobody is personally on the hook for the company's total health in the long run. (Sure, they're indirectly on the hook. If the company starts doing poorly, they could risk losing their jobs.

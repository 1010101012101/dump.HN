4175817,comment,4175646,4175646,11,0,zanny,,,"I think all the outrage is that Python 3 behaves like a new language in how everything needs to be ported (albeit at a magnitude less complexity than going up the language chain or across the playing field, like C to Ruby or C# to Java) but it still incurs the new language cost, while being the new version of the old language.<p>If people just thought of Python 3 as the replacement to broken text model Python, like how XHTML tried to supplant HTML and failed, and then HTML5 supplanted XHTML with some quirks, the same thing happens here.<p>Also, I adore the comments about the GIL.  I understand the benefits of using a single language in every circumstance, but (even) a JIT scripting language is not sufficient for all problems.  I guess it depends on if a polyglot code base is more complex than handling multithreading and the corresponding memory complexity and gimmicks, and that is developer centric.<p>Still, I would much rather just stick processor bound code in openMP C functions and call those from Python when need be.

I wouldn't be surprised if there are some domains of maths where even natural numbers are used rarely or almost never (formal logic springs to mind). That's why it's possible to cherry-pick favourable examples which support either side of pi-tau debate.<p>But you might say, of course, that those fields of mathematics which tau makes ""easier"" are the ones important in early math education (especially below the university level). Hence adopting tau would make them substantially friendlier and more intuitive to many people. While the idea of ""fixing"" math concept to make them more bearable to laymen should not be dismissed automatically, I would like to point out that the question of tau vs. 2pi is by no means the only issue of this kind. Indeed, there are a couple of more ""warts"" in everyday maths that could also warrant ""fixing"". Consider:<p>* The direction in which positive and negative angles on two-dimensional, Cartesian plane are measured [1]. Counter-intuitively, the measure increases when going <i>counter</i>clockwise, while going clockwise decreases it.<p>* The main diagonal [2] of a matrix goes from upper-left to lower-right corner, which coincides with the shape of <i>back</i>slash character.<p>* The established order of indices for matrix' elements is row-column, so that A_xy refers to element in x-th row and y-th column of matrix A. This goes against the habit of specifying the horizontal coordinate before the vertical coordinate when talking about XY planes [3].<p>* Definition of convex [4] and concave [5] functions (for R->R ones) do not agree with the intuitive associations based on plots of those functions. Clearly, the convex one looks like a valley, and the concave one resembles a hill or mountain.<p>I'm sure there are many more examples of such unreasonable, counter-intuitive conventions, so we really have a lot of work ahead of us. So, anyone fancies writing the Slash Diagonal Manifesto?...<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#Positive_and_negative_angles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#Positive_and_negative_ang...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_diagonal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_diagonal</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Cartesian_coordinates_in_two_dimensions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Car...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_function</a>",1340958490

The general problem is that bogus data leads to an irreparable situation. To fix that bug, you have to find out who broke the data. Consider for example, a circle in a linked list. You would need quite an expressive type system to prevent that statically (dependent types might suffice? Theorem provers are the ultimate hammer).",1340958408

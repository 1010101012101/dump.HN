This greatly limits the ability of the markets in question to do anything remotely economically efficient. Follow the link I posted and read for a while, and it'll take you through the process of deriving the concept of money from a set of those markets. (Well, sort of; it comes at it from a different direction but it's equivalent.) The real world is more complicated.<p>Incidentally, the model in that book will be mathematically degenerate in the other direction, at least for most of the book, because it goes to the opposite extreme of completely <i>ignoring</i> transactions costs for a while. Reality is, as usual, somewhere in between, but it is <i>much</i> closer to the market-with-money model than the everybody-is-bartering model.<p>So, I'm using it in the math sense, not in a moralistic sense.<p>If the phrase ""market efficiency"" is striking fear in your heart, remember that what that means in reality is that the barterers are closing themselves off to better deals and reducing their wealth vs. what they could be doing.<p>So, if that's true, why are they bartering? In the real world, money does involve a certain floor of transaction costs, imposed by the government for tax reasons. (I'm not saying I disagree with this, just that there are costs.) Things near the boundary of those costs can be worth just bartering, or selling ""under the table"". But it's effectively impossible to ""barter"" your way to a car or a house. (Yes, I know it's been done but it's generally a gimmick.) It can also be possible to barter between two people who simply have no money, in which case the reduced efficiency is a tradeoff you have no choice but to make. (One of the worst things about being poor is how it can lock you away from the very higher-efficiency economic transactions that you need to escape from poverty.) But like I said, it's not the awesome blueprint to a new economy (which I realize wasn't explicitly said in the article), it's a special case that has little general application.",1259111561

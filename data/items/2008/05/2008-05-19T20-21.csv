Erlang variable assignment follows a pattern matching semantic, so locals cannot be reassigned. And all values are immutable in Erlang, meaning that you can't change the value of something ""Below"" the covers.<p>Therefore, for loops are pretty much impossible unless under the covers you map to function calls. And at that point, if you have tail recursion, why not just write it that way yourself? It's almost always less code to write a tail-recursive iteration vs. an explicit iteration in a language with pattern matching.",1211230793

This town is more populous than San Francisco and yet people still refer to SF as ""the city"".<p>However, if you live here, you'll find that it's not quite that simple. There are creative and life-affirming things here, but the only architecture that's available is the strip-mall, so that's what people use. For my money, the best coffeehouse in the entire area (including places like Ritual in San Francisco) is located in an unassuming strip mall in Santa Clara, next to a big-box TV retailer. (<a href=""http://barefootcoffeeroasters.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://barefootcoffeeroasters.com/</a>).<p>And there are vibrant immigrant populations here, particularly Vietnamese, and they bring their cuisine with them. San Francisco itself is so expensive that it's getting older, richer, and more ethnically homogenous all the time. Pretty soon it's going to be just twentysomething white trustafarians and fortysomething white management consultants.<p>But that just barely modifies jwz's critique. For now, if you want to feel like your soul is enriched just by walking down the street, you have to live in SF. If you want a place to put your bed and TV, live in San Jose.",1211230538

And come on, San Francisco has its share of fake and cliche (North Beach? Haight? The area around PacBell Park?).<p>Since the link focused on the negatives, I'll throw some positives out there (coming from a San Jose native who has lived in SF, LA, Chicago, and now Morgan Hill - mushroom capital of the world).<p>1. There are some cool little neighborhoods in the San Jose metropolitan area: Willow Glen, Rose Garden/Burbank, Campbell, Saratoga, Almaden Valley.<p>2. Good ethnic food, especially from Latin America, Vietnam, India, and China. Even some good fine dining opportunities (La Foret in New Almaden comes to mind).<p>3. A great Latino/Chicano cultural scene.<p>4. Decent transit that's been getting better (much, much better than LA, lagging a little behind SF and WAY behind Chicago/New York).<p>5. Retail tech stores all over (even SF lacks this).- Central Computer, any number of Fry's.<p>6. A developing downtown. If you'd been here ten years ago, this place was dead. If you'd been here 20 years ago...well, you wouldn't have been downtown. The fact that you can go there at night at all now is AMAZING considering what this place was like when I was a kid. It's fairly jumping now, with a decent selection of restaurants and good parking.<p>7. Cheaper than SF by a bunch.<p>San Jose is great, especially if you aren't into the trendy hipster scene and don't mind heading into ""scary"" (aka non-Anglo) parts of town like East San Jose, Little Saigon, etc.",1211230362

These are incredibly exciting new developments.<p>There was a great one I read a few days ago about our conception of space as a continuum being an approximation.  Space might be better understood as being quantized.<p><a href=""http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/080514-black-holes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/080514-black-holes.htm...</a><p>There is also the idea of doubly special relativity, in which there is a shortest unit of space, which all frames of reference measure the same that is analogous to the speed of light being the fastest light can go and all frames measure the same.<p>When I studied philosophy in college, my interest was philosophy of mind/consciousness studies.  My papers were mostly papers that examined the philosophical implications of assuming space was quantized and doubly special relativity were true on theories of consciousness.  I had to waste entirely too much effort arguing that philosophers should pay really close attention to the science when doing mind or ontology.  I'm excited to see that these developments are unfolding.  This means there is a huge space in academic philosophy to merge this new information in physics with philosophical theories about consciousness, spacetime, and ontology.<p>These developments might indicate that once in a generation revolutions in physics and philosophy are imminent over the next five to eight years (assuming the academic philosophers can hold the circle jerks long enough to hear and grok what the physics people are saying.).",1211227762

The problem is that technical people of both genders are often completely unaware of the existence of better jobs.

There is a parking garage at the core of the airport, so you can drive into this garage and drive in a circle and park adjacent to your terminal, and walk out on the axis directly to your flights.

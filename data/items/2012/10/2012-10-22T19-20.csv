The perfect phone for me would be this:<p>- Can make and receive calls and texts.<p>- Has a phone book (just a name/number key-value pair).<p>- Has a clock and timer/alarm.<p>- NO OTHER SOFTWARE FEATURES.  Nothing extra other than calls, texts, phone book, time.<p>- Small e-ink display.<p>- Simple T9 keypad.<p>- Rugged construction, should be able to take a lot of abuse.  Should not feel cheap.<p>- Small and thin.<p>- Tons of battery life.<p>- Beautiful, minimalist visual design.<p>- Cheap enough that you can lose it without feeling bad.<p>That's all I want - something optimized for calls and texts, nothing more or less.  It would be a cheap phone to produce, I think.  Would there be any market for this?<p>EDIT: the Motofone looks like it's kind of like this (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Fone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Fone</a>), but it has a segmented display (bad for texts), and it sounds like it feels a bit cheap.

4685190,comment,4684305,4684590,25,0,tptacek,,,"It's an amusing sleight of hand to equate Tesla's run-in with franchise law to Uber's run-in with taxi licensing.<p>Franchise laws are the product of decades of overlapping private/public enforcement of contractual issues between dealers and manufacturers. It seems clear on the face of it that Tesla should in no way be encumbered by the arrangements made between General Motors and its dealers, because Tesla never had dealers to pull the rug out from under. And this is notwithstanding the fact that encoding and enforcing agreements between dealers and manufacturers should have been the province of contract law, not statutes.<p>Taxi regulations serve legitimate purposes beyond enforcing agreements. For instance: in many states, it's difficult to get a job driving taxis or even black cars with a suspension on your record, because the licenses are held by parent companies who are liable to lose them if a driver causes an incident.<p>Loud arguments declaiming the insanity of applying taxi regulations to a service as excellent as Uber also tend not to engage with the real argument, which is, ""what do we do when there are 10 Ubers, and drivers can hop between them?""<p>You can believe that there are valid reasons to regulate cabs and black cars, or you can not believe that. But it's intellectually dishonest to lump that question in with franchise laws and licenses for florists.",1350935978

Especially for people in the younger demographic like me (I'm in college), my colleagues can (and do) live off their phones. They send and receive email, communicate socially via Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, play games, takes notes, and compile to-dos and calendar appointments. It's quick, efficient, and painless.<p>Before you know it, our phones will soon be replacing our credit cards (i.e. wallets) and opening doors for us (i.e. our keys).

I wouldn't call it production-ready, but the shadowing is small and it's more than usable.  Available RAM is abysmal, but that's a separate problem.<p>The weirder part is how e.g. dragging an icon makes a greyscale-rainbow trail behind it as it redraws pixels.  Panning through the app screens is also pretty crappy, and all the little animations are so over the top with a slow screen rate that the results are basically laughable.

I'm afraid of it going down like this. I die, and the Valkyries select me for Valhalla. As I enjoy the afterlife there, knocking back flagons of mead and knocking up wenches, while trading tall tales of valor with the other chosen, there comes a knock at the door. A maiden answers, and then goes to Odin and whispers something.<p>Odin frowns, and whispers something back to her. Now all eyes are on the maiden as she walks back to the door, and invites in two Mormons. She leads them to Odin, and they hand him some paperwork.<p>Odin summons me, and tells me that they are from Mormon Heaven. He tells me that my half great great great great great grand niece has converted to Mormonism, found me in their ancestry records, and baptized me into the Mormon Church--and that I must leave Valhalla and move to Mormon Heaven. No more mead and wenches for me. :-(",1350935923

4685175,comment,4684599,4684599,5,0,aneth4,,,"A good list of considerations. The most important ones I think are still the classic two:<p>1) Emotive - The name should evoke some sort of emotional connection. This is essential to being memorable and likable. This is why computers.com and chairs.com are not so great for selling computers and chairs unless you are going for mass-market, price-based, SEO-optimized, unbranded sales.<p>2) Meaning - The name should evoke some sort of actual meaning associated with your product. This becomes less important as a company becomes established. When a name is established is the right time to separate the meaning component, not when the company is formed. Apple was formerly Apple Computer, but Apple would have been a terrible name choice in 1979 because it would require too much explanation.<p>Hipmunk is terrible name for a travel product, despite Jude calling that out as a good one. It has decent, if confusing, emotive response, and zero meaning or association with travel. Establishing that as a travel brand will be much more work than, say Kayak, which has at least some association with travel. I, for one, struggle to recall ""Hipmunk"" much more than Travelocity, Kayak, or Orbitz.<p>AirBNB is a good name, but fails is the secondary concern of being easy to communicate and spell. Despite that, it is strong in the two primary concerns above, so it is ultimately a good name. I agree with Jude that at some point they may follow the path of Apple and reduce the name to a more essential emotive component, such as just Air.",1350935864

Succinctly, our pricing is not set in stone is likely to change.<p>Keep in mind that the vast majority of weddings these days do not have full planners, and if they work with a planner, generally it's a month-of or day-of planner, so that lowers the tiers of people we would be ""competing"" against.<p>WeddingLovely is also very new, so starting out at $14.99/month seemed ideal to test out. $19.99 is actually an experiment in price anchoring. $119 is because people usually work with us way before their wedding so we wanted to have a tier that rewards people who start with us early.<p>Basically, <i>these are all guesses that we're testing</i>, and will update and improve both our pricing as well as our features as we work more with engaged couples as well as gain more experience running an online wedding planning app.",1350935796

Their disadvantage is that they aren't as well capitalized. Their lack of working capital will kill them if they have to pivot very far from their current path, but otherwise it won't be an issue as long as they can scale production with demand.<p>Currently, you can't buy anything like a Model S from any of the other brands. Further if they start <i>today</i> it will be 24 months before they can launch something. So Tesla has a couple of years of runway, nearly all to themselves, in this space. (Note if you don't think they bring anything unique, I suggest you get a test drive of a model S and then go to Nissan and drive a Leaf) Tesla sells a 'no compromises' electric car, no compromise on range, no compromise on performance, no compromise on comfort, no compromise on quality. And significantly cheaper to fuel up. So that will sell them a lot of cars to people who are attracted to that stance, and those people's followers will get cars because they are followers.<p>Now it is an open question as to how many total cars that first batch is. Is it 100k, 250k? 1M? That depends on a lot of things. But if electric cars do take off as mainstream, I expect Tesla will be the 'best' one for a while yet.",1350934873

Some things make sense. Lots of women write papers on Sociology/Gender, and this doesn't shock me in the least since I think more women consider gender issues over men who have the privilege of not needing to think about it (which is part of the problem). Culturally, we push women to studying things that are family, children and fertility related as well (and push men away from them)- and these are present in the numbers.<p>Yet under Law, you've got only 8% of papers on Antitrust by women, but 34.6% on legal oversight and regulation. It clear isn't that there are no women in law, but something has influenced them to study different things in the larger subject of law.<p>Similarly- Mycology has 57.1% of the papers on Yeast with authorship, but 7.7% on Zygospores. What makes yeast more equitable than zygospores? Again, it isn't that women aren't in mycology, but for some reason are studying different things it seems.<p>And for mathematics; 24.3% for Lie Algebras, and 4.5% for Oscillation Criteria. I honestly don't know what either of those are, but they don't appear to be particularly gendered sub-topics/specialities in math. I understand that culturally we push young women away from some subjects, but I've never heard someone intone that a woman shouldn't do oscillation criteria or automorphic forms in math, or encourage algebraic groups instead?<p>(Numbers above looking at first author)<p>Clearly, there is a gap.

How does running your servers and services on a PaaS provider solve the need for OS updates and security? What are your typical architecture and operations like?<p>I personally think that OS updates and security fixes/hardening are crucial in all cases if you're running any production site (and even for the dev environment). Granted, some of the colocation providers don't offer services like AWS VPC (and the associated SecurityGroups and ACLs) but that's pretty rare nowadays. In all cases, and Ops or a Sysadmin person is quite important for the stability of your business.<p>The only big advantage I see about using PaaS is the rapid and flexible provisioning of new instances in case you need them. That's why the best solution to me, so far, has been running a combination of bare-metal servers with optional provisioning of additional cloud instances if you need them. The price difference can go to orders of magnitude (even if you factor in the costs of paying somebody to be a system administrator and take care of your servers).<p><i>Edit: added the last paragraph</i>",1350934606

(Especially because my Kindle is <i>part of the reason</i> I read so much, not just the means by which I do it.) A Kindle is still a lot more portable than even a paperback. (I can comfortably fit it in a jacket pocket.) It's still way more convenient to be able to buy books whenever you want than to have to plan a trip to the bookstore or library. It's still a lot nicer of a reading experience than most paperbacks.<p>Yes, I do spend a lot of money on books every year. When you look at it in context though, that number really isn't crazy, even for something I don't end up owning. Cable TV, a Netflix account, Spotify, and going to the movies once a month are all in the same order of magnitude for similar-ish kinds of things, and you don't end up owning anything as a result of any of those, either. Reading--even when you're buying every book you read--is actually a surprisingly cost-effective means of entertainment.<p>And there's definitely not a 100% premium compared to me buying the physical books--that's a very silly way to do cost analysis. A sizable percentage of the actual benefit of reading a book is reading it for the first time, so losing access to it later doesn't completely devalue your purchase. Even if you were to factor in the chance of losing access to the books you've spent money on later (which is entirely reasonable), you should also be factoring in the chance that you <i>don't</i> ever lose access to your books. Anecdotally, events like this seem extremely uncommon, and so treating them like a certainty doesn't make much sense.<p>As I said, I'm not trying to defend Kindle (or any other) DRM here. I'm trying to argue against the idea that people who own and use ebook readers are idiots.<p>(And as for how I read so much...20 minutes both ways on the subway plus another 3-4 hours throughout the week is easily a book a week for me--I read pretty quickly--and I occasionally just sit down and decide to spend an evening reading instead of doing something else.)",1350934040

Personally though, I just haven't found node to be that useful compared to Go, also for me the nested callbacks within callbacks are annoying. So I'd say to pick Go, although its a little early in the game to see how well it will be adopted and how many useful libs will be created for it, nonetheless the language itself is beautiful mix that gives you low level (c-like) control and speed, with nice abstractions that make your job less tedious than c and more like python/ruby programming.<p>Last a note about Ruby, I think the VM is amazing the API is great and programming in ruby you can throw things together blazingly fast and clean, so its also a good choice. Overall though I'd say Go, I think its the best language to come around in a long time and people will adopt it",1350933888

Every year it seems to go down a couple times for at least a couple hours.<p>Heroku should offer a choice between N Virginia and Oregon hosting (I think they're almost comparable in price nowadays).  That way people who want more uptime/reliability can choose Oregon.  Sure it will be further from Europe (but then it will be closer to Asia) and people can make that choice on their own.<p>But basing an entire hosting service on N Virginia doesn't make sense anymore, considering the history of major downtime in that region.",1350932539
4684845,comment,4684599,4684599,36,0,tptacek,,,"Or, just name your company quickly and move on. We lost a couple weeks early on to naming Matasano, and after some false starts, eventually gave up and thumbed through a list of exotic plants. By the time the book of plants had been opened, the naming premise had been accepted: we were done trying to find a semantically ""fitting"" name for the company. We just picked a plant with a cool name.<p>We ran into two ""problems"" down the road; first: it turns out that a ""Matasano"" is a ""quack doctor"" in South America, which we discovered shortly after hiring someone from Argentina. We quickly convinced ourselves that the irony was a value-add, not a cost.<p>Second, we kept getting confused with Monsanto. This sounds (a little) sillier than it actually is. A lot of our clients, particularly back in 2006-2007, were large enterprises where the staff was particularly likely to have some confusion. We had more serious conversations about renaming over the Monsanto thing than over the ""quack doctor"" thing.<p>Ultimately, we just got over it and kept plowing forward. Equity goes <i>into</i> your name; it usually doesn't get extracted <i>from</i> your name. There's some sense in picking a good name, but keep in mind that weeks of time --- which is what we were facing --- is a very steep price to pay for something that might only be marginally important down the road.<p>I submit that the term ""Airbnb"", while memorable, has very little intrinsic meaning to most people who rent out their places on Airbnb. Ebay has none whatsoever. ""Heroku"" was one of YC's biggest acquisitions; that name breaks one of the rules of thumb of this post (3 syllables, yet means nothing to its customers). ""Stripe"" and ""Square"" and ""Paypal"" are great names, but ""Braintree"" seems to be doing pretty well too, and if ""Braintree"" is OK, I humbly suggest that ""Mindweasel"" and ""Thoughtpants"" will work too.<p>This is a good post. All I'm saying is, be careful of the procrastinate-y issues that come up early in your company. They all matter less than execution on everything else.",1350932512
4684844,comment,4683874,4683874,1,0,backwardsx,,,"I never understood people's love for Windows XP. It maybe started to get good after a few service packs but I found it to be unstable and prone to slowing down after a short while of use even into SP2.<p>Whatever initial criticisms of XP that had come out were probably justified (It definitely was and still is an ugly operating system).  I don't agree with the author's point that people automatically hate whatever windows version come next. It just seems that way because we haven't had a good windows since 98.<p>The only reason why windows 7 actually turned out to be a decent operating system is because it needed to be, the competition(OSX, linux) was gaining ground under XP primarily because of how bad it was. Sure I imagine that the age of XP had something to do with it but I remember installing linux back in 2004/2005 after one to many blue screens with XP and not looking back until windows 7.",1350932504

Since such people don't end up buying one (as they cannot afford it), letting them test-drive serves no purpose other than wasting the dealer's time, and setting a $300 fee helps weed them out. Note that most high-end car dealers do this.<p>Another way to think about it is this: if you were a serious buyer, i.e. the type who can spend a tens of grand on a car, then a $300 fee would be pocket change for you. In all likelihood, it would count towards the purchase of the car if you decided to buy one. But declining to pay the fee basically confirms their suspicion that you were <i>not</i> a serious buyer and were there simply to satisfy your curiosity.",1350932481

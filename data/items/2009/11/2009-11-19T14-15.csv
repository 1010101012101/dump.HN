I took it in the softer, more poetic sense that they're listless, apathetic, lacking in the proud vigor and vibrancy of their youth.   This was captured best when he said this:<p><i>People today still love HP calculators made 30 or even 40 years ago. Has HP made anything this decade that anyone will remember fondly even five years from now?</i><p>I agree with you  that hardware and software decoupling is a very good thing.   I also do not see this as being mutually exclusive to what Gruber is suggesting.   If Dell wanted to invest in being a player in user experience, there's no reason that they would have to tie their system software to their hardware.<p>The biggest flaw that I see in Gruber's article is that he might be overestimating consumers themselves.   Sure, the computer industry is different from the days when you tried to sneakernet a 1-2-3 file to a friend's machine only to find that he was running Visicalc on CP/M.   But will consumers accept this change without knowing what an open standard is, or a document format, or a portable runtime, or cross-compling, or virtual machines?<p>I'd guess not, given that I've talked to seasoned geeks who haven't yet fully internalized that things are different today.    Consumers, recoiling from the  fear of ""incompatibility"", all happily ran to one side of the boat in the 90s and nearly capsized it.    Teaching them that diversity doesn't have to mean incompatibility seems like a daunting task.",1258640452

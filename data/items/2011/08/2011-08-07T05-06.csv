The inventor should take care to keep logs of all research.  In original invention, the trail from research to the idea should be evident if it meets the right patterns - I'm not sure exactly what these patterns would be, but I do think there is a definition that is meaningful enough to considerably aid the situation.<p>2)  Eligible inventions would include anything that a customer pays for - as in the exchange of value designates the scope of invention from a patent enforcement perspective.  From a patent defense perspective, as long as the invention logs show no use of another patent (when the attacking inventor requests certification at their own expense).  This would also focus invention on creation of value instead of creation of legal IP.<p>3)  I disagree, this proposal is an attempt to let people opt out of a broken system by certifying invention through at least one adopted methodology of original design.  Again, think of it like buying insurance - every complex industry requires some sort of overhead to deal with subjective enforcement of laws.  The capping of costs reduces the average overhead so much vs the current system where anyone who succeeds in the market pays a big, unpredictable legal tax.",1312696485

We've learned this lesson the hard way, but fortunately didn't have to use all of the following advice.<p>Always take a part payment up front before starting work. Between 30% and 50% is a fairly standard and safe amount. Always take another part payment after demonstrating your progress. Ideally upon final delivery the balance to be paid for your work should be less than 30%.<p>If clients are unhappy about paying you up front, you need to ask yourself why they're unwilling to pay anything to start, when they will be paying $10k to you in the very near future.<p>If they don't trust you, they'll work with someone else. You need to be able to trust them too, and taking a part payment up front is often the quickest way for you to learn that they are trustworthy.<p>When a client isn't able to pay, you should try and negotiate payment in full over time. Regular, small payments give them a chance to pay off their other creditors and give you regular indication that they're trying to pay you back.<p>If they refuse to pay, or miss their regular repayments, don't be afraid to go to a debt collector. Make this clear when you are negotiating the payment schedule. At this stage, any money you can get back (less the often expensive debt collection fees) is a bonus.<p>Even if the amount is paid back in full, we make it a rule not to work for this client again.<p>For an amount this large, you should definitely talk to a lawyer. Keep a close eye on your cashflow over the next few months.<p>Best of luck recovering the payment!",1312694799

The man was a professional bad debtor.<p>He built a relationship with me for 6 months, having me do work that he initially paid for in cash or check, which always worked fine.  Over time, the jobs got larger, and more costly, and we moved to 30 day terms.  I never bothered with a credit check because he built a relationship that started on pre-pay cash.<p>His last job was to hit me with the 20K job.  Bad check and it was all over.  What really sucked about this job was it was not all labor, and I had employees do the labor which also cost me. My cost of goods on this job was 75% of the total, which I had to pay to my vendors.<p>I sued him in small claims for the max amount in my state.  I sued him two times by breaking the job into two invoices so I could try to approach the total amount owed.  Merely serving him took weeks and required I hire a pretty ruthless process server.  He was good at hiding out.  I received judgement and won the case.<p>He never paid.  I sent him to a collection agency who called me back in a day to tell me they knew of him well.  There was and is no way to collect.<p>His son has the same name as him, which is part of his scam.  He is ""married"" or at least with the same woman for decades.  All assets are in her name, but since they are not married there are no mutual assets to have liened or seized.<p>The only thing I could have done different, perhaps with more research, would be to have a sheriff on the courthouse to take his car on the spot.  That may not be possible, and really depends on the circumstances.<p>In the end, the only thing I was able to do was harass him on the phone and dig through the work I had done, locating the people he resold my work to and warn them to cancel all payments.  Once of his clients was nice enough to hold payment back for a time and give it to me as long as there were no legal repercussions coming from the scammer.<p>His initials are T.W. in case it is the same person.  I still hold judgement to him this day.  If he ever opens a bank, buys a house, gets a credit card, or does anything that can be attached as far as funds, I will get in a line and maybe get paid after all the others are paid in the order in which he screwed them.<p>This will end up being a lesson learned.

Think of how much more it costs to not have a skilled labour force. South Korea also has subsidized education, I live in South Korea and I pay 3.5% tax (that's everything, I have nothing to pay but 3.5% income tax). The education system here is not great and there are issues with it but over 97% attain a high school certificate and almost everyone under 30 has done at least one year post-secondary education.<p>Here is a question: how much does it cost the US, <i>as a democracy</i>, to not help everyone with the capacity to learn get an education? At the moment education levels in the US are often offset by immigration (immigrants with degrees and immigrants forcing their kids to study hard for at least the first generation).

But for some people, if they don't experience it, they're not able to take the same knowledge to heart.<p>I was in a business simulation competition once during university.  At the end, when they were about to announce the winners, one of the judges got up and said, ""Business is like sex.  If you've never tried it, it doesn't matter how much you read about it, how much you know about it, etc.  Until you experience it, you don't really understand it for real.""

I discovered they were doing these tiny little 1 line solutions using functional programming techniques, where I did much larger solutions.  I started studying every aspect of how these solutions worked.  Along the way I learned about fold, filter, map, and so on.  Then I re-implemented my solution using functional idioms.  Then I moved on the the next project Euler problem.  It didn't take long until I had a pretty firm grasp of it. I did this in Scala; perhaps the same approach would work for you in your language of choice.",1320037443

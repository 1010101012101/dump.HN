You might have a bad experience with a few  white, black, poor, or rich people, but this certainly does not mean they are all the same. I have experienced similar situations several where people ask me stupid fucking questions or make ignorant comments just because of where I am from. I usually do not respond to such low level of maturity and knowledge and the few times I do I make sure they leave the room felling way less intellectual than I am (although I am not so smart, maybe a little bit). Sorry you got screwed by poor people, but not all poor people are the same. There are several stories we can tell about rich people screwing other rich people, in fct I am sure there are more of those cases than his. ",1189050071

50913,comment,50773,50899,0,0,tipjoy,,,"Thanks. Just to be clear: this isn't about my 'feelings.'  It's actually about having a successful startup: one major reason people fund startups is because they think the founders have the right characteristics that will make them succeed.  They're looking for a certain type of person, not just an idea.  Through its posts and comments, this community shares a mental model of what type of person makes a successful founder.  Having that image be of a particular gender negatively impacts those of us who happen to be women or who have women in their startup team. <p>This example from Founders at Work struck me: Caterina Fake, co-founder of Flickr, related an anecdote where she and her partner, who was also her husband, met with a VC firm.  Caterina didn't fit the VC's mental model of a founder.  After the meeting the VC told her husband 'not to bring his wife to VC meetings.'  ",1189049442

It's rare to come across a slum without a television or radio--at least in Bombay where I grew up. <p>While television and radio are relatively old things that took their time before reaching the slums, it's amazing how fast the cell phone has penetrated even to the poorest of folks in India.",1189049344

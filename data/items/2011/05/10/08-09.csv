Why is company Z not allowed to figure out even better ways to monetise it?<p>You probably think the money lost by A is greater than the money gained by Y and Z. I think that's not true - a lot of great art is derivative, and a lot of interesting business models around art have not been explored because the incumbents (A) resist it.<p>You could also argue that A won't be incentivised to produce the art, but... actually, if only one country does this, that's not true.<p>PS: China doesn't count, yet, for two reasons: 1) it's not a western democracy with a long tradition of western-style art and copyright and a hunger to innovate on the art distribution models; 2) copyright theft is not actually legal there, it's still illegal, just loosely enforced; that prevents real legit businesses from emerging in that space.",1305017639

2531853,comment,2530963,2530963,2,0,horatiumocian,,,"I think that Microsoft buying Skype makes more sense than Google or Facebook buying Skype.<p>First, the way for Skype to make decent revenues is to go for the enterprise market, which brings them paying customers. It would be really hard to convert end users to paying customers, because of all the competition out there (Google Voice). So, they need to cater to enterprise customers. And Microsoft is huge on the enterprise, they would be able to integrate it into their suites, and make it a multi-billion dollar product in a few years.<p>I don't see any reason for Facebook buying Skype (different technology, different culture, price too high). Also I don't see any reason for Google to buy it other than to kill it and fold it into Google Voice (possible anti-trust issues?). So, even if the Microsoft-Skype deal isn't a match made in heaven, it still makes much more sense than Facebook-Skype, or Google-Skype.",1305017516

Generally users don't understand and don't need to understand the difference.<p>I played with the Cr-48 recently and thought it wouldn't succeed, being at an inconvenient position between my Macbook Pro and iPad. If I sat down at a desk, I'd prefer my MBP either to code, browse the web on my external monitor, or perform other tasks like sorting my photos or music collection. If I wanted to browse the web while in bed or on the couch, I'd use my iPad. Similarly if I wanted to bring something out. The Cr-48 didn't fit in for me. I thought that Google would do better if they focused on making Android for the tablet form factor even better since it seems like that form factor is the winner in the near future.<p>But perhaps I'm wrong. Watching the video, I realised that maybe putting things on the cloud is how Google envisions Chrome. For casual users, you don't need hardware that has a user-writeable disk for storage or powerful machines. Perhaps there is still a (major) group of users that can do with a laptop form factor, with built-in camera, wifi and/or 3G connectivity that focuses on web applications and websites. The video clearly shows what's possible. It doesn't have to be Gmail. It could well be Facebook. It isn't a toned down netbook, it is a machine that has good connectivity to the cloud with a laptop form factor.<p>The Cr-48 looks similar to the black Macbook which Apple used to sell. It already looks good. But imagine a version with a Macbook Air design?<p>Pieces of these are obvious, but put together and you have a story.",1305016589

Without it, search engines and the largest archive of web content, the Internet Archive (where I work on web archiving), could not exist at their current scales, as a practical matter.<p>There's a place for ArchiveTeam's style of in-your-face, adversarial archiving... but if it were the dominant approach, the backlash from publishers and the law could result in prevailing conventions that are much worse than robots.txt, such as a default-deny/always-ask-permission-first regime. Search and archiving activities would have to be surreptitious, or limited to those with much deeper pockets for obscuring their actions, requesting/buying permission, or legal defenses.<p>So, Jason, be careful what you wish for.",1305014970

The fact that you only know how to do math does not show that you are intelligent; it only shows that you are specialized. The fact that women prefer men who are good at socializing is, ironically, direct Darwinian selection for intelligence.""<p>You know, I'm tired of smart people apologizing that they're good at math/programming/physics/whatever. True, the fact that you are a math pro shows that you are specialized, but by being <i>able</i> to understand and achieve in this field you showed intelligence. I would define intelligence as the <i>potential</i> of acquiring new skills. ""Soft"" skills can be learned through books and experiment (i.e. reading How to Win Friends and Influence People, doing a salesmen course, etc.). The fact one didn't ""learn"" it and shows some seemingly innate ability just shows that s/he either learned unconsciously through imitation or through a lot of experimentation in his/her youth. Life xp and observation just led me to agree with what's presented by pg in <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a> .<p>p.s. I'm also tired of this meme that women having some weird darwinian developed methods unlike men for processing relationships. While it may be true on some level people are making too much of it. They are ordinary persons. Just imagine a person that about half of the population is being aggressively nice to her since she's 14. Extrapolate and the rest follows.<p>edit: you can't imitate math. you can't imitate programming. being around people who are good at these (i.e. raised by a couple of professors) might give you some good learning stamina and people to consult with, but you still have to develop an internal understanding. Soft skill are different in that regard - you can make great strides by just imitating people who you think are appealing/confident/good communicators (to a degree). You might not understand why it works, but it will work.",1305014831

I think the key word in your comment is ""learning"".  Like almost everything, the way we think is a result of habit and that's good and bad news.  Bad because habits are difficult to change, but good because they can be changed.<p>Cognitive therapy isn't just for for people experiencing difficulties, I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in self improvement.  Hackers especially I think would find it interesting because it's almost like a set of hacks for your mind.  Two books in particular I'd recommend to anyone who might be interested:<p>- ""Feeling Good: the new mood therapy"" by David Burns<p>- ""The guide to rational living"" by Albert Ellis<p>Somewhere on the web there's also a fascinating video of a talk between the Dalai Lama and Aaron T Beck (considered to be one of the founding fathers of cognitive therapy along with Albert Ellis).  It's surprising how similar cognitive therapy is to some types of Buddhist meditation",1305014665

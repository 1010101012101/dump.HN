My belief could be formalized ""For any person with a set of beliefs about consciousness, their beliefs are wrong, and they are not justified in holding them.""<p>You said:  ""I do reject the idea that conscienceless is anything more than the byproduct of the physical process of the brain, of course, I don't think that's what you're implying, I hope.""<p>This is exactly like saying:  ""I reject the idea that final digits of pi is anything more than the byproduct of the physical processes in my computer's calculator program""<p>I don't think actually I implied not-physicalism, but I would be happy to endorse it.<p>The idea that consciousness is illusory relates to high functioning autism in people who develop the theories in a complicated way.  Ludwig Wittgenstein, for example, had a very autistic picture theory of language that gave way to a non-autistic theory as he got older.  For very intelligent people who are blind to other minds, studying consciousness is very important, because, to them, it seems like the most logical way to understand people.  I don't mean this as criticism of intelligent people with autism.  But, relying on these people to understand consciousness is like relying on a colorblind person who has mastered scientific and mathematical models of analyzing wavelengths of light to explain color as an artist experiences it.",1212364726

206275,comment,205689,205894,0,0,vlad,,,"Thank you for your post.  I did not mean that you would sign up for 30 credits a semester and attempt to take tests to see what happens.  You would really have to show the professor you know the class really well and have a good reason for accelerating your education.  Also, faculty are not administrators, they are former students.  They enjoy helping bright motivated students, no matter how much money the student pays in tuition.<p>However, taking many more credits ""with department chair permission"" is always a real option.  Steve Pavlina got a B.S. in Computer Science at a state school in California in 1 and 1/2 years.  He simply valued which assignments were worth doing and attempted many more credits than other people did.  He also made decisions in under one minute that would normally take his peers weeks to arrive at (such as what topic to write an essay about.)<p>And actually, he got the department's highest honor and maintained a good GPA by doing this.",1212363349

206271,comment,205420,206208,0,0,tptacek,,,"Man, this sucks. This is a stupid semantic argument (""obstacle"" versus ""control"" versus ""constraint""), but it's also what's wrong with a lot of crappy security out there today.<p>An obstacle is something you overcome. I don't think you mean it that way, but that's what a lot of people think. So, for instance, a Javascript hashing scheme backed by a Greasemonkey script that tries to verify that passwords actually make it through the hash function. That's good, because it ""adds obstacles"". The security of the system is the sum of the value of all the obstacles.<p>No. The security of the system is inevitably the value of the 1-2 most important controls and constraints. Think of it like the difference between O(log n) and an O(n) algorithms: the constant factors don't mean much. So, you can do all sorts of gymnastics with hashes and nonces and salts (and timestamps and sequence numbers and MACs), but you turn SSL on, and now <i>the only thing that matters is SSL</i>.<p>The ""obstacle"" mindset, also known as ""defense in depth"", is what gets us IPS, web application firewalls, and antivirus. None of these $50,000 products work. But they're defended by managers and purchasers and vendors as ""another layer in a defense in depth strategy"". What we need is software that works, with defenses that are clear and fundamentally sound. What we get, too often, is band-aids.<p>Again, I apologize, because I'm turning you into a straw man and I don't mean to. The word ""obstacle"" sets me off. It shouldn't, because obstacles pay for my consulting team and my development team. I should say, ""more obstacles, please!"" ""Please, build another ActiveX control to implement an AES challenge-response protocol with a compiled-in key!"" ""Please, build another web filter for which every nonminimal UTF-8 encoding variant is another security advisory for!""<p>Oh well. I'm old.<p>By the way, being somewhat close to the drama here, I want to note that the ""new Threat Modeling"" is a bit controversial, the terms are still up in the air, and if you want to learn more about security, you'd be far better off reading Ferguson's ""Practical Cryptography"" and McDonald, Dowd, and Schuh's ""Art of Software Security Assessment"".<p>Don't build obstacle courses.

I don't know what sort of mutant you think I am, but I don't have that many fingers on my right hand.<p>And that's not even counting all of the 3rd party code which gets run on FreeBSD (including the 18000+ programs in the ports tree) which make the perfectly reasonable assumption that FreeBSD's printf(3) conforms to POSIX requirements.<p><i>you tried to remove Hyperthreading from FreeBSD</i><p>No, I didn't.

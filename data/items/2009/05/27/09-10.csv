The command line is a great environment on low power hardware, it doesn't need a mouse and you don't have to wait for IDE support to start working with a new or obscure technology.<p>That said, I still feel I need netbeans/jvi to do anything with Java -- personally I feel this is due to shortcomings with the language rather than a problem with the way I normally work. In fact, I recently started playing with Scala and, since netbeans didn't really add anything useful, I was able to go back to vim. I feel much more productive in Scala/vim than I ever was in Java/netbeans.",1243417647

628238,comment,627666,628053,0,0,leecho0,,,"I think it has lots to do with cultural values. I went to elementary school in Taiwan for 4 years. In an asian education environment, you need to take exams after exams to get into good schools to get a good job. Not to say it isn't the same in the states, but it's on a different level. In junior high school, it isn't uncommon to see kids stay at school for 14 hours plus to study months on end. Most schools have rankings for midterms/finals, and some give out a slap on the wrist for every point under 90 (at least when I went to school) to reinforce the importance of studying.<p>So being bad academically is more like losing a school wide competition, rather than the American system of being able to shrug it off as something you don't care about. In Asian countries, they don't buy the idea that people can be talented at different things, it's more a black and white ""you're smart or you're not"" thing. So of course people like winners more than losers.<p>So back to the point in the article.. I don't think it's about the actual utility of a person's skill, but the perceived successfulness within the context of societal values.<p>Which brings up an interesting point: other than using the societal values, how else will you know how successful a person is when real success is often based on luck and isn't apparent until ~30?",1243416664

628210,comment,627728,627858,0,0,kaens,,,"I assume that language implementors ""like"" flat namespaces because they are easy to implement. Or easier. I've never looked into how such things are done, but it seems like flat namespaces are a much simpler problem in terms of implementation, at the cost of making users of the language be careful about name collisions.<p>""Flat is better than nested"" is a rule of thumb, not a maxim. I agree that the python standard library could use a bit more nesting, but I think that going to the same lengths as java wouldn't fit with python too well.<p>I've never had to step carefully to avoid namespace clashes in python - I'm curious as to when and/or how you run into this problem. The only way I can think of that would make my code run into it a lot would be if I was doing a lot of ""from foo import *"", which generally isn't a good idea. ""import foo"", or ""import foo as bar"" serves the same purpose.<p>It seems to me that having a nested namespace for the standard library, but not to the point that it's a tree, is roughly analogous to a lot of other design decisions in Python - for example, there not being any concept of private or protected variables, at least on the high level.",1243415072

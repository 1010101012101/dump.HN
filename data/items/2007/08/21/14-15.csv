I'll probably get a lot of flack for this, oh well - but PHP isn't as bad as people say it is provided you take advantage of OOP and separate your logic from presentation.",1187706982
44787,comment,44580,44766,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"There is a well-worn path for beginners in PHP, with baby steps and encouragement all along the way. You can gradually mix PHP into your HTML site, line by line and file by file, and make your site better with each step. (Look, I've got the date in my Web page and it actually updates!) <p>There's a tradition of building simple CRUD apps in PHP - a handful of database tables, and a PHP file for each URL that acts as a thin glue layer between raw SQL and HTML presentation. These are some of the easiest Web apps to understand - which is not to say that they are actually <i>easy</i> - and they are a good place to start.<p>By contrast, learning something like Rails requires a big up-front investment. There are objects. There's a database <i>and</i> an ORM. There's an MVC framework. There's an abstract mapping between URLs and the methods of your controller objects. All of this makes great sense once you can see the big picture, but to a brand-new programmer PHP must look a lot less intimidating.\n",1187706907

And having a policy to openly discuss everything, which goes hand in hand with consensus decision making, creates a healthy forum to resolve conflicts before they blow up into unresolvable or annoying-to-resolve situations.",1187706792

The ones who ask for help all the time (and get lots of face time).  If you understand the material, what are you supposed to do - waste the teacher's time by asking questions you can answer yourself?",1187706750

In any independent studies I&#x27;ve seen it in inconclusive and some of them suggest that file-sharing actually boosts sales by providing a fremium model / free advertising / word of mouth transmission etc.<p>Also many other things are shared via the pirate bay other than copyrighted films and whatnot.",1448852363

Not only does it make more intuitive sense, but when I&#x27;ve helped troubled family members, this has worked much better in practice than giving cash.<p>The article, which seems to support giving out cash, admits they don&#x27;t make good decisions.  A more generous assumption is that they spend it on their needs but spend all their will power doing so, leaving less willpower to address other problems.<p>Note: I&#x27;m in favor of helping the poor and I&#x27;m not bashing them.

In this case, case 3 occurs with zero probability. There is an infinite interval over which both E1 and E2 are greater than any random number R.

Publishers get access to whole marketplace (traditional (ad networks + mediators) and RTB). What does it mean for publishers? It means larger number of ad networks can compete for your inventory. Programmatic ad mediation solutions accept bids not only from OpenRTB enabled bidders, like traditional RTB exchanges do (Nexaxge, MoPub), but also from traditional ad networks, like Admob, AppLovin, UnityAds, Adcolony, Facebook Audience Network as well as other RTB marketplaces (like Liverail or Spotxchange).<p>2. Auction-based vs. waterfall\nEvery auction is open and all bids are transparent to everyone. Every demand source is allowed to increase their initial bid for impression to overbid other sources, that place higher bid. One auction does not mean one bid per demand source anymore. It’s a continuous  process that happens  almost instantly.<p>3. Mitigate 2nd price auction\nIf you don’t know how 2nd price auction works, simply advertisers can win bidding with $10 for eCPM but only pay $2 (because this was the second highest bid).\n<a href=""http://blog.appodeal.com/rtb-user-info-and-cpm-3-tactics-to-multiply-the-profitability-of-mobile-advertising/#second-price-auction-issue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.appodeal.com/rtb-user-info-and-cpm-3-tactics-to-...</a><p>4. Data Enrichment \nEvery auction is enriched with demographic user data, including age, sex, address, zip code, GPS, income, parental status, etc. Having user data in place enabled demand sources to bid higher on segments of users they are interested in. You can also use this data to set up direct deals over OpenRTB PMP on any RTB exchange.<p>In addition to that, Appodeal is different in a few other ways:\n- Free for publishers. We do not charge publishers any fees. \n- Immediate payments. You can request payments $20+ at any time and you will receive it in 3-5 business days.\n- One SDK and one account for all major traditional networks and RTB marketplaces.\n- We consistently generate highest eCPM (check performance per ad network). \n- We support cross-promotion and direct ads<p>Read what our reviews of our customers on G2Crowd:\n<a href=""https://www.g2crowd.com/products/appodeal/reviews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.g2crowd.com/products/appodeal/reviews</a><p>If you have any questions or need help, email me and I will put you in touch with our publishing team. \nmyk at appodeal",1448850156

The final velocity of the hole after it eats the atom will be equal to the velocity of the center of mass of the hole + atom before the atom is eaten. But if the hole has the rest mass of Mount Everest, the motion of the center of mass of the system will be almost the same as the motion of the hole, since the rest mass of Mount Everest is probably about 40 orders of magnitude larger than the rest mass of an atom.<p><i>> meaning that new atom now has EXACTLY the same gamma as the black hole</i><p>Yes. But this gamma will be slightly less than the gamma of the hole before it ate the atom.<p><i>> and steals just as much momentum as if gamma was 1.</i><p>I see what you&#x27;re thinking, but it&#x27;s still wrong; you haven&#x27;t calculated the effect correctly. See below.<p><i>> It only needs to absorb mass similar to its own rest mass.</i><p>No. Say the hole starts out with rest mass M, and is moving at velocity v, where v is almost 1 (the speed of light), so the gamma factor is, say, 1000. Then the total momentum is about 1000M.<p>Now the hole absorbs enough atoms to have rest mass 2M, and each atom is at rest before it&#x27;s absorbed, so each atom contributes zero momentum to the total, so the total momentum is still 1000M after all the atoms are absorbed. That means the gamma factor is now (to a very good approximation) 500 (rest mass 2M times gamma of 500 times v approximately 1 gives momentum 1000M), which still corresponds to an ultrarelativistic velocity.<p>For the velocity to be less than Earth escape velocity, the total momentum of 1000M would have to be carried by a hole with a rest mass of about 3 million M, since Earth escape velocity is about 1/3000 of the speed of light (11.2 km/s vs. 300,000 km/s)--i.e., we would have rest mass 3 million M times gamma of approximately 1 times v of 1/3000, to give total momentum 1000M.<p><i>> That is also irrelevant. The only thing that matters is its &quot;width&quot;, i.e. how many of the particles it interacts with does it eat.</i><p>The cross section (what you are calling &quot;width&quot;--what fraction of particles encountered does the hole eat) will depend on the speed of the hole; the faster the hole is traveling, the lower the cross section will be.",1448850138

(All instructions at <a href=""http://www.osxlatitude.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osxlatitude.com/</a>) A physical copy of Snow Leopard is required. I encountered problems downloading Yosemite in VirtualBox, so access to a real Mac may be necessary. My local Apple Store had everything locked down, but a nearby PC store (also selling Apple) didn&#x27;t! Initiating a download on the App Store added Yosemite to my account, and made it possible to continue the process back home in VirtualBox. Once I had a bootable USB flash drive, the installation was a breeze.<p>After that, just fiddling with drivers (&#x27;Kexts&#x27;) and bootloaders - not too intimidating for Linux users.<p>Most importantly for the experiment: XCode works perfectly!

6420122,comment,6418628,6419886,1,0,freehunter,,,"I don&#x27;t think polygamy is specifically disallowed by the state, depending on how you define polygamy. Since marriage comes with tax and legal benefits, the state has an active interest in controlling what is legally defined as marriage (specifically, how many people are party to one marriage. I&#x27;m not talking about controlling any kind of two-party marriages like one man and one woman, two men, or two women).<p>For the religious definition of marriage, there are no laws saying you can&#x27;t be married in your religion to multiple people. The only stipulation is that you can only be <i>legally</i> married to one person because of the aforementioned legal and tax benefits. There&#x27;s no law prohibiting me from having six female roommates who are exclusively in a relationship with me. There <i>is</i> a law saying I can only be legally married to one of them at a time. The rest of the women would be legally single and religiously married.",1379707192

The title is &quot;The Case Against High-School Sports&quot; not &quot;The Case Against Sports&quot;. The argument is whether an academic institution should be spending so much of its (potentially tight) budget on athletics and whether it should be glorifying athletic accomplishments so much more than it does academic accomplishments.<p>I&#x27;ve played sports, both in-school and out-of-school, almost my entire life and I love sports as much as anyone else, and I think the article makes a valid argument. Sports are great and kids can learn a lot from them, but I don&#x27;t think school-affiliated sports over many benefits over club-affiliated sports, and even if they did, I question whether those benefits outweigh the costs of schools putting so many resources into them.<p>edit: I was missing a word",1379707174

Given that the A57 finished design last year, and started taping out early this year, it seems unlikely -- if not strategically risky -- that Apple just went their own way.

He wrote (as quoted by CBC news[21]):<p><pre><code>    &quot;I have concluded that this case is essentially about harm. More specifically, Parliament&#x27;s reasoned apprehension of harm arising out of the practice of polygamy. This includes harm to women, to children, to society and to the institution of monogamous marriage&quot;.
</code></pre>
Bauman argued that there are cases where the &quot;wives&quot; (who may be rather young; sometimes as young as 12 years) are abducted and abused, but because they believe in a faith promoting polygamy, they are not willing to bring complaints to the authorities. He reasons that these offences sometimes may be stopped by applying anti-polygamy legislation.<p>The decision was welcomed by the attorney general of British Columbia, and by a representative for the group Stop Polygamy in Canada. Likewise, according to the CBC news,[21] some polyamorous groups in Canada expressed their relief, since Bauman had stated that the law shouldn&#x27;t apply to them unless they decide to formalize their unions.<p>===<p>reference [21] is a broken link on wikipedia, <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/11/23/bc-polygamy-ruling-supreme-court.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/11/23/bc-polygamy...</a>

6419914,comment,6414466,6416838,1,0,IanCal,,,"> So your example still requires that state exist, it&#x27;s just far more global.<p>The state exists only in your <i>application</i>, not in the test. Your given sets up the environment in the way you want, the &quot;when&quot; manipulates the environment and the &quot;then&quot; checks that the environment exists in a particular setting.<p>> I&#x27;m still not with you on the timing thing. By the time that step is reached, either the state has changed, or it hasn&#x27;t.<p>This doesn&#x27;t apply to your tests. What I&#x27;ve seen before is a step that says<p><pre><code>    Then X changes
</code></pre>
Which is implemented as<p><pre><code>    previous = X.state
    wait 5 seconds
    X.state != previous
</code></pre>
This relies on the previous step taking long enough to actually change the state that the change happens during the wait. All of the tests I was dealing with were asynchronous.<p>Your pattern does look quite nice but there are still dependencies that aren&#x27;t specified in code. For example, assuming you have a complementary step about the edit version changing written in the same way.<p><pre><code>    Given a credential for a supported vendor
    When I do something that changes the edit version
    Then the edit version should be changed
    When I do something irrelevant
    Then the edit version should not be changed
</code></pre>
This would fail, saying the edit version has changed. Contrived, I know, but the problem with dependencies that aren&#x27;t specified is that you start having valid tests that fail because they simply do not do what they say. I&#x27;m strongly in the camp of &quot;If it shouldn&#x27;t work, it shouldn&#x27;t build&quot;.<p>My core suggestion for all of this is to write your behavioural tests as a test script. What does the user do to get to that point, how do they interact and what&#x27;s the result. The state exists either in your application (which is fine) or is explicit in the writing of the tests (Given I log in as person X rather than Given I log in).<p>Cucumber is a great tool, but it leaves a lot of things implicit, which to be fair could probably be solved as a library. I&#x27;d have much less of a problem with all of this if when I wrote an invalid test, something warned me. I&#x27;ve spent far too much time battling with cucumber tests which lied about what they were actually testing.",1379704719

Just because there are homeless people who are homeless because they lost their job and now cant afford food/shelter, doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t homeless people who prefer that lifestyle. If you are in a nice climate (like SF) and you are given food, shelter, and basic necessities plus some luxuries (bike laptop etc.) then the idea of working extra hard to land a crappy job where you can still only survive with subsidized everything and you don&#x27;t have any spare money, doesn&#x27;t sound so appealing. People on here infer that the average homeless person had some great job, a house, car, etc. and they just need some help to regain that. I&#x27;m sure there are people like that who exist, but I would warrant a  great deal of the homeless (those who aren&#x27;t addicts or mental)wouldn&#x27;t have a much better lifestyle if they got a job, because the job would likely be minimum wage.

If one hour&#x27;s worth of information is incorporated into the securities&#x27; prices between the two sets of fills, that is a really huge amount of exposure compared to what I would expect today.  I would have to be believe that the EV of the position is quite large before accepting one hour&#x27;s unhedged exposure to get in on it.  I could try to get rid of the round trip by using market orders everywhere, but this doesn&#x27;t actually sound less risky.  My belief and knowledge of the trades at some particular time would have to justify entering the position at some unknown pair of prices an hour later.<p>The great many participants who have not-incredibly-strong beliefs about the value of some hedged position will just not trade.  The absence of their trades is a loss of information to the market; the market is less efficient.  We probably share the belief that a more efficient market is good and a less efficient market is not so good :)<p>Enough with the hedged positions though!<p>Normally for this type of proposal I can just answer &quot;If we do this then spreads will get bigger and that&#x27;s bad,&quot; but here I have trouble doing that, because I&#x27;m not even sure if the notion of a spread or an inside price would make much sense once everything is so illiquid.  Rather than having a view of the market that is a bunch of orders I can interact with at will, I would instead have a record of all the trades that happened in the last timestep and which orders were intact at the end of the last timestep.  This is probably not sufficient information for me to learn the best prices at which I can be certain to buy or sell.",1379703833

If nobody responds, it basically gives the government a green light to do it again, and again.<p>I&#x27;d disagree with our &quot;functional political system.&quot; There&#x27;s so many systems in-place that warrant a conservative behaviour. Such as the vote of non-confidence, first-past the post, no set terms or set maximum time in office, etc... It encourages the government to only act in their best interest. Only being interested in staying in office. Thus, potentially controversial or progressive bills would be worthless to make. So they do the same &quot;safe&quot; thing.<p>I would also argue that we have really bad representation (not relative to any other country - just an absolute bad). Some have proposed other voting systems such as proportional representation.

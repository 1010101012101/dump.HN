So why not Bitcoin? Web wallets need to develop excellent security procedures, like banks, and the best ones have done so: MtGox, Coinbase, etc.<p>&quot;risk of government legislation&quot;: so far governments have been welcoming to Bitcoin. A US Federal Judge have ruled Bitcoin is real money [1]. The US Treasury Department FinCEN said Bitcoin &quot;hold greats promise&quot; to the US economy [2]. The German financial regulatory agency, BaFin, has officially classified Bitcoin as a commodity. Australia said they would investigate Bitcoin thefts with the same thoroughness as cash thefts. China is tacitly approving Bitcoin as government-controlled China Central Television is increasing its coverage of Bitcoin, with a surprisingly positive tone(!) Canada is very Bitcoin-friendly (hence the first ATM located there). Etc. And keep in mind it only takes a handful of countries to be friendly to Bitcoin for it to have a safe base to rely on.

That&#x27;s the one thing about Bitcoin you can trust: the protocol is ruled by cryptography and algorithms. It has been reviewed by many security experts.

6694518,comment,6693176,6693176,1,0,gfodor,,,"Hungarian notation is not a workaround, but a <i>medium</i> for expressing semantics about something that cannot be done with the type system. It is literally by definition this. If you think about it, this is the point of naming variables in the first place. No matter how advanced your type system is, there will be semantic information that it does not or cannot encode. Hungarian serves to systematize the definition and use of this semantic information. Hungarian is intended to maximally leverage the semantic bits of information (in a literal sense) we can put into names to the fullest extent possible. You&#x27;re already making this tradeoff when you name something, it&#x27;s unavoidable, and Hungarian is an attempt to find a local optima that falls out of specific assumptions around the purpose of names.<p>For example, in a simple discussion board app, you may have a string of text in memory that has the following attributes:<p>- It is null terminated<p>- It is ASCII encoded<p>- It contains properly formatted HTML<p>- It has been sanitized against script injection attacks<p>- It was received by an end user, not rendered from a template<p>- It is one in a specific series of strings being processed by a overarching process<p>- It contains content that is intended to be injected onto a page<p>- It has been matched to contains swear words that need to be censored<p>- It is longer than a certain number of characters and hence needs to be stored in a text field, not a varchar<p>- It potentially contains copyright infringing text<p>I could go on and on. The point is not to get hung up on specific examples, but to note that there is a <i>ton</i> of semantic information about a piece of data, any of which may be a) relevant to the user and b) irrelevant to the goal or capabilities of the compiler&#x27;s type system. In many of the cases above, one has a hard time imagining what exactly a type system would even do with this information, since it&#x27;s fuzzy and not really something that should be used to strongly enforce contracts.<p>This is where the system of Hungarian comes in: it forces you to build a taxonomy of this semantic information so you have a way to leverage it and reduce the amount of entropy a system can have in variable names.<p>The bottom line is you are going to name a variable <i>something</i>. So what do you name it? If you think about it logically, it makes sense to name it in a way that the most semantic information that is the most relevant is conveyed to the user. English is poor at being efficient and packing in dense information, but it is comfortable and ramp-up time is near zero. Hungarian optimizes this differently, and trades ramp-up time and comfort for efficiency, precision, and density. It is really the vim of variable naming conventions, and like vim, it is not for everyone.",1383886227

Four months ago I started working for this company, the understanding was I&#x27;d work for three months at $20 an hour then they&#x27;d hire me at $60K.<p>Three months roll around, nothing. I called my recruiter, told my boss, but nothing happened for another two weeks. Finally I badger my boss into making some inquiries. He tells me we&#x27;re all good, follow me into the CFO&#x27;s office and we&#x27;ll talk about bringing you on.<p>I get in there and the guy tells me that the recruiter&#x27;s fee is $8K and they don&#x27;t want that going on this year&#x27;s balance sheet. So they want to bring me on Jan. 1st.<p>Fuck that.<p>I told him, no, that&#x27;s not acceptable, we need to work something out. The difference in pay is $400 a week, are you willing to give me that as a bonus? He tells me maybe they can come up off a grand. I stare at him until he cracks. Finally he says he might be able to get them to put the fee on next year and they can bring me on Dec. 1. I didn&#x27;t react to that.<p>After I get back to my desk, I&#x27;m pissed.

Monday morning rolls around, I call my recruiter and tell him to start looking for a new job for me, and explain to him the heap of bullshit they&#x27;re expecting me to swallow.

And thanks for sharing.<p>I&#x27;m not (yet) a developer (though that is my long game), but I have run into similar situations in data science. I had an idiot boss (boss of my immediate boss) who sat around all day with his feet on his desk, staring off into space, but demanded that we all work 60-ish hours a week. And this was at a bank, where the standard was 40 and they made a lot of noise about their support for work/life balance and having family, etc. Anyway, he was a dick, too. Passive aggressive, the whole nine yards. So I found another job with a rapidly growing tech company and received an excellent offer. It seemed like a fantastic opportunity to really take my skill set (in data analytics) to the next level. I&#x27;d be <i>the</i> data guy and the role would work directly with the CEO, President, and all the other acronyms at the highest levels. The work I did would directly impact everything. Seemed cool. And for a couple days, it was. I went in early, stayed late, and worked my ass off to learn everything. They had three or four different databases running MySQL and MS SQL, and none of the data was documented. Which is to say that the only ones who knew what a given field was in the database were their 3 developers. When I started they presented me with a list of 114 reports they wanted created for the company. When I left, after having produced a significant number of those reports, the list had grown to 124. From the first day it was a constant struggle to figure out how to pull data from all their various databases, determine which fields were the right fields (i.e., it&#x27;s called X, is it X? Or is it called X but it is actually Y? Or it is called X, it generally is X, but sometimes it&#x27;s Y?), and smoosh everything together fast enough for their near-daily meetings. After a week the President called me into his office and told me I wasn&#x27;t coming up to speed fast enough. I was completely stunned. And I attempted to professionally defend myself against his baseless assertions. I pointed out that I&#x27;d only been their a week. That I had a huge amount of data in a number of databases for which there was no data dictionary of any sort to make sense of. That I was making rapid progress in both learning the data and making effective use of it. That he&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find anyone else who could do any better than I was. I pointed out that I was doing everything in my power to get up to speed as rapidly as possible: I was coming in early, staying late, and working weekends. In the week I worked there I put in close to 70 hours. And I didn&#x27;t get to see much of my family (wife and daughter). It sucked. But I thought that it might be worth it.<p>The clincher came when, in our conversation, I told him that I was rapidly coming up to speed, but that doing so fully would take time. He told me (verbatim), &quot;we don&#x27;t have time. We need to go faster and faster. I don&#x27;t have time for you to come up to speed.&quot; Then he gave me (implied with a grim smile full of teeth) a week. &quot;We&#x27;ll see how you&#x27;re doing in a week...&quot; he said.<p>But after he blind-sided me like that, I put in a long day, mulling things over. Then I went home and talked to my wife. The conclusion I arrived at was similar to your own. It could&#x27;ve been a great opportunity if the company leadership (namely my boss the President) wasn&#x27;t completely unrealistic and divorced from reality. To this day I have no idea how they expected anything different than they got from me. Did they truly expect me to come up to speed even faster than I was? Within a week? Or was our weird and painful conversation some perverse sort of pep-talk?<p>Either way, in talking it out with my wife, when it came down to it we realized that it just simply wasn&#x27;t worth swimming in the sea of vipers. There was no way I was going to work 70-84 hours a week for the salary I was making ($57,000/yr). Not when it was working for people who clearly had no idea what they were asking of their employees and how to treat people. They just didn&#x27;t deserve to have my talent, abilities, and work ethic on staff. I wrote a one sentence resignation letter and dropped it at their office the next day. I said &quot;This letter serves as notice of my resignation, effective immediately.&quot; I decided that any more long-winded explanation of my reasons for departure would be lost on a person like the President, so I put all those reasons in a Glassdoor review of the place. True to form, I received an email out of the blue from the President a month later. &quot;Abe, saw your Glassdoor review. What gives?&quot;<p>Also, similar to your experience, I got the impression after a couple days that I wasn&#x27;t the first data guy they&#x27;d tried to bring on board. Though no one would talk about it, I got the impression that they, too, hadn&#x27;t stayed very long.<p>Anyway, I share my story by way of commiserating with you. It&#x27;s shocking to find such horrid work environments somehow persist, even for highly skilled individuals. We expect better treatment, and often get it--which makes it all the harder to take when we don&#x27;t. Of course, in your case and mine, I wouldn&#x27;t take that kind of treatment no matter how much the job paid, or how much I liked the work or product.<p>Thanks again for sharing!",1383885313

Along with that, I have been contemplating replacing my tablet (Nexus 10) or getting a phone that complements my tablet usage. I&#x27;m curious what others think and devices they themselves have and find useful.<p>I currently have the Galaxy Nexus which has a 4.65 inch screen. It&#x27;s definitely the smallest I would go with a screen. To me, the size is great for a phone and borderline too small for web browsing and what not. It works but not ideal at all. For that reason, I have been considering the Note 3.<p>Although I love stock Android, the size and feel of Note 3 is great. However, having never really USED it, I wonder if not being able to utilize it one handed (small hands) would be detrimental. However, it&#x27;s &quot;phablet&quot; size would make it more usable for web browsing, emails, media, and so on. Perhaps replacing the need for a smaller tablet?<p>If it does indeed replace the need for a smaller tablet, then maybe I keep my Nexus 10? However, I do find it cumbersome. I never really bring it anywhere since if I&#x27;m bring my bag I have my laptop anyway. It is bigger for watching movies and such, but is something the Nexus 7 so bad? I&#x27;ve used them for web browsing and the size is nice to hold one handed and two handed I can actually reach all over the screen with thumbs (need to move entire arm for Nexus 10).<p>If the Nexus 7 is in fact a more enjoyable experience... then I have to reconsider the phablet (Note 3) since do I really want to devices close in size (if only the leaked Nexus 8 was real and being sold... that might work!)? So, if I decide on a Nexus 7 then maybe I get a smaller phone like my Galaxy Nexus (i.e. Moto X, Nexus 4, or Nexus 5).<p>Anyway, I just don&#x27;t know, lol.

Whereas something like mathworld.wolfram.com usually offers a concise, accurate, and well-written article on a subject, it&#x27;s quite often at a fairly high-level, and may be hard to understand for someone missing some background.  The equivalent Wikipedia article on the other hand, is often much longer, because it approaches the topic from many points of view: concise technical explanations suitable for a mathematician, more intuitive (but maybe less rigorous) explanations aimed at a general audience, implementation hints and algorithmic summaries for those interested in using it in a computer application, etc.<p>This sort of shotgun coverage can result in rambling, lengthy, and sometimes redundant articles (it&#x27;s usually pretty clear that many different authors have edited it, and the collaboration mechanisms are far from perfect), but I&#x27;ve found it immensely helpful when trying to understand something which is just a bit beyond my level.

I think we can talk about arrogant people in any area. But as someone already mentioned, if you take a look at LinuxQuestions, you&#x27;ll see that people have been nice for the last 10 years or more. I never had a question been answered with arrogance or bad manners.

Even without subsidies, a grid-tied solar power system will pay for itself well within the lifespan of the cells (the lifespan of solar panels is 25-50 years). A battery-backed &quot;off the grid&quot; system is not there yet, because the batteries are expensive. How soon it pays off will depend on how cheaply you obtain the panels and how much you pay for installation; these vary <i>wildly</i> depending on the location and vendor.<p>I did my own solar installation for about $1000, and it&#x27;s enough for me to live lightly on (no AC, no microwave, no electric heater, but laptop and phone and hotspot stay charged, and fans can run indefinitely). Fridge runs on propane, when I&#x27;m off-the-grid. I&#x27;d need to quadruple that to turn on the AC or electric heat for any length of time, and would need a lot more batteries (I have three group 27 deep cycle batteries and a 3000 watt inverter).<p>Anyway, I got sidetracked a bit. We&#x27;re currently at the point where a DIY installation can pay for itself in under 9 years. Maybe even as little as 7. Professionally installed systems, with subsidies, are probably around the 10 year repayment mark. And, the panels get cheaper every time I look into it. The batteries stay pricey, though.",1383883345

Not because they shipped more consoles, no console maker actually makes the majority of their profit from raw console shipments, it&#x27;s a very misleading figure. What matters more are sales of games and DLC and subscriptions to services. In those measures the 360 has been trouncing every other console maker. People who own 360s spend more time playing the console, they spend more money buying physical games, and they spend more money buying DLC and subscribing to xbox live gold. Microsoft does more business on higher margin items than other console makers.<p>The Wii made ok money for Nintendo but the sales dropped off really fast, and people didn&#x27;t end up playing it much, or buying many games for it. The PS3 took a long time to reach a state of maturity where there was a sufficient stock of good games on the console to actually justify owning one. And eventually the PS3 managed to get to a state where it was actually doing well. But from a business perspective no matter how much better it was doing the 360 continued to outpace it (in game sales especially). These are some of the major reasons why there even is a new console generation this year, Nintendo and Sony need to put themselves on a new footing in order to have a chance of growing their market share.",1383883283

Think of all the places where people communicate with you (web, IM, social networks); we want to organize that data.  <p>Present day Xobni is already more than a plugin to Outlook.  We keep our own store of all of Outlook's email data and our UI doesn't use the Outlook plugin architecture (it is very limited).  What does this mean? .... it means you can point Xobni at any email data store and display it within any application.  However, there are costs to moving to new platforms, so for the time being Outlook is the place to be - 300 million users and they have credit cards.",1195098551

I don't know what it is but the colour needs correcting. A white background also helps. The difference between someone really noticing a recipe and ignoring it can be greatly improved by adding good quality images. For example compare these:<p>- <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/roboppy/sets/72157594175367381/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/roboppy/sets/72157594175367381/</a> <p>- <a href=""http://blog.cookingwithpatty.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cookingwithpatty.com/</a><p>with these ~ <a href=""http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/154/Biscotti"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/154/Biscotti</a><p>Another problem I see is the lack of tools to create a community as outlined by greenspun ~ <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/community"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/community</a><p><i>""...

I've been meaning to turn on that noprocast option, but never really got around to it. Seems like now my indecision is paying off! Lameness as virtue! (evil laugh)",1195096076

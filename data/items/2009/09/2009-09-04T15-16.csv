805049,comment,804716,804716,0,0,dkarl,,,"God, I can't believing that changing a tire is still considered a masculine topic.  No self-respecting American woman under forty would hesitate to pull out the jack and take care of a flat herself.  Feminine helplessness went out with crew cuts, Jello molds, and green bean casseroles.  Men may be generally more interested in cars, but nobody changes a tire for fun -- they change a tire when and only when they need to.  Men don't have more flat tires than women, and even the nutty car enthusiasts I know don't rotate their own tires -- it's really boring, and it's much easier and quicker for a pro.<p>So I ask again, why is it a masculine topic?

Whence the vehement defense of the thesis?<p>The example of the cars is so completely bogus that it ought to be embarrassing for a physicist (which Locklin is) to have written it; one would expect them to know better.<p>It's about like saying:<p>- between 1900 and 1950 we invented all this awesome new technology<p>- but the information density of printed books (words-per-page) has remained roughly constant from 1950 to 2000<p>- ergo the rate of change must be declining<p>...in other words, compare:<p>- in column A: an unqualified sense of ""rate of progress"" over some time interval<p>- in column B: a product whose performance on some metric is substantially constrained by some combination of physics and rigid human factors<p>...and then point to lack of substantial improvement in the product's score on the metric in column B as evidence for the deceleration of progress; it is at heart only a qualitative improvement but there's no radical improvement to be had in that area, so looking to it and wondering ""why no radical improvements in the information density of printed text?"" says more about you than about what's happening.<p>Now, why the car example is bogus:<p>There's only so much energy in a gallon of gasoline, and fuel-efficiency is thus bounded to a pretty narrow range of variation.<p>Modern cars are larger and heavier than equivalent product categories of yesteryear, mainly in response to safety regulations.<p>Just look at the Nash Metropolitan (conveniently parked in a standard USA parking space for size reference):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nash_Metropolitan.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nash_Metropolitan.jpg</a><p>Or if you're not so good at depth perception:<p><a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/.a/6a00d8341c630a53ef01156fb8b753970c-500wi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/.a/6a00d8341c630a53ef01156fb...</a><p>(next to a cooper mini for comparison).<p>There's no mystery here: the 40mpg car he picked out of the past got 40mpg b/c it's a tiny car.<p>This isn't a case of some technological triumph of our forefathers being abandoned by decadent successor generations; it's a case of the laws of physics dictating the range of possible cars, and there being not all that much stateside consumer demand for microcars like the metropolitan.<p>So yes: cars today are little different in fuel efficiency than cherry-picked microcars of the 60s and 70s because the laws of physics haven't changed between now and then; we're not driving 100mpg micromachines because no one wants to buy them (yet).<p>I'd wager a fair amount that in a universe in which we <i>were</i> all driving microcars good old Locklin would be bitching about the forgotten musclecars are of yesteryear, along the lines of his concorde complaint in the same article.",1252079041

During his lifetime, he saw the popularization of the automobile, the application of radio, then television, the deployment of air travel, and men walking on the moon.  I have argued that we are not likely to see changes of that magnitude over our lifetime.<p>Another perspective is the impact of technology on rural life.  During his lifetime, we saw technology increase the productivity of the american farmer by two orders of magnitude.  No other segment of daily life experienced that form of amplification.

There needs to be something showing that the Internet changes our lives in ways similar to what radio, television, antibiotics and the atom bomb changed lives in the first half of the 20th century.<p>I think part of the problem with making that argument is that the Internet and computing technology is changing life much more appreciably in India and China than it is here.  It is allowing people in India to suddenly join the cubicle dwelling, information processing, Western world work force in large numbers in ways that are profoundly changing the lives of many people there.  Walmart's computerized, just in time inventory systems makes ordering products in China and getting them to the right shelves in a timely manner feasible.  That is having perhaps an even more profound effect on the life of many Chinese.  (This also applies to many other developing countries, of course.)<p>So it may be that the technology advances are less noticeable here in the U.S., where many of us were already working in offices and shopping at department stores in the 1950s.

bpang,127,"My goal is to use technology to empower people. Empowering people can mean solving a problem or making people happier. I particularly have a passion for products that I can personally relate to. After working in investment banking, merger and acquisition, and business development, I ""hacked some system"", in 2008 to attend Stanford Graduate School of Business and pursue my entrepreneurial goal. My hobbies include traveling, art, food, board games and most recently video making (check out my latest: http://bit.ly/ngnvideo3 and more to come on this site: http://bit.ly/gradnet)! I love observing the beauty of humanity through different lenses whether through friends, travel, or art. Having lived in three continents, I love meeting new and different people. My previous work experiences involved a lot of working with people and that was always the part I enjoyed the most, more than building complex financial models. Painting and designing products allow me to release creativity. Finally, board games provide a great playground for strategies and spending time with interesting friends.",1265162386,1452888852

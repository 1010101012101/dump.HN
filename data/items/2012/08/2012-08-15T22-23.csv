The purpose of this was to make it hard to modularize GCC, because if GCC were modular, then you could write a proprietary component for it (like you can write proprietary Linux modules).<p>Surely you must be joking... do you have a reference for this?

The things that stop me from porting stuff to Python 3 from the side of Python are largely resolved.  In that regard I am just a lazy person and nobody cares about Python 3 <i></i>YET<i></i>.  As far as the general development of the language goes there is still a lot missing in Python 3 that worked in Python 2 so I am not excited yet.<p>Port will happen though, just have to decide when I will break the API to make it possible.  As it stands right now a port won't be possible without breaking Werkzeug's API because it's just one level too low.",1345071561

4388779,comment,4382456,4382456,1,0,jfaucett,,,"what programming languages do you teach? I ask because, I remember now back to when I first really started trying to program, and I think it would have been great to get introduced to interesting code bases back then. So guess, I'm just looking back now and will recommend what I wish I had had, maybe some of it help:)<p>As a teen, I fumbled around for a while before discovering linux and open source and that good feeling you get when you download the src and start perusing and firing up your debugger. Having said that if you teach js, I'd highly recommend dojo, underscore, I guess most c /c++ might be too advanced but if not Webkit, Redis, and glib are clean fun code bases and dissecting Lisp / Emacs was a blast. As far as answering you actual question goes, I really liked Gdel, Escher, Bach back then, also thinking recursively by Roberts. The only ""technical"" book I enjoyed reading was Modern Operating Systems by Tanenbaum ( don't know what current editions are like, the roughly 2000-2001 version was great though). Its was simple, very clear, humorous, and a gives a great overview of how the os works.",1345071535

If Apple is not able to get transit data (which it's not, Google has been at this for years now and started with only a couple cities), then the right solution would be to still leave it to third-party apps, but have some better integration.

At the least a cause to cease diplomatic and trade relations.<p>If Sweden truly just wanted to question Assange, they could do it via mail, email, phone, video chat or of course an in person meeting in the UK. All of which I believe Assange has already offered to do. But they've declined. Which means that Sweden/UK/USA's actual goal is something <i>other</i> than simply questioning him. It's a fact that he's neither been convicted or even charged with any crime (IIRC), especially not with respect to the supposed sexual ""assault"" incidents, which look like he-said/she-said instances at best, and a frame-up at worst.",1345071467

Sure I speed. Nearly everyone does. But just because there was no cop to see me and ticket me doesn't automagically make it legal. It just means I got away with it. If the stretch of highway I regularly commute on had speed cameras installed... it would not take too many tickets before that stretch of highway started to flow at the posted speed. People get pissed when a law that is largely unenforced starts to get enforced more strictly. So naturally they will want to strike down any new tech that assists in that stricter enforcement. I'm not sure how cops gave out speeding tickets before radar guns but I'll bet that tech dramatically increased their ability to enforce it.

I'm really pleased to hear you've had success with your apps.<p>I'm sorry about my hyperbolic tones earlier. It's just that there's so much blind hype about the app stores, that it upsets me to see indie devs getting lured in and going bust. I don't hate Apple. I think they are brilliant.<p>I haven't done huge amounts of research on the distribution of outcomes for developers in the app store, but the typical prices are so low that you'd have to sell to a hell of a lot of people to make any decent money. Moreover, most devs only charge a small one-time upfront fee or IAP, which means you need to keep finding more customers or churning out apps.<p>I know how hard it is to make a good business even with a SaaS recurring revenue product. A life-time value of $2 sounds horrifying.<p>There is no doubt in my mind that some people are making good money on the app store. My point is that they could be doing a lot better in another market, with lower risks.<p>You mention one of your apps is making you enough money to live on. Do you expect that to carry on for a while? Or will you need to make more products? If you're willing to share, I'm curious to know more about your business, but I'll understand if you don't want to share too much.",1345071414

4388758,comment,4383159,4383565,1,0,derekp,,,"From my perspective, it comes from being used to parentheses in English.  Specifically, you have a man thought, then you have some other modifiers that may expand on that concept which you enclose in parentheses.  This fits well with C style functions, for example.  But with Lisp, the main thought (the function name) is also enclosed in parentheses along with all its modifiers, which makes it a bit harder to follow the code.<p>However, I do like the overall elegance that this brings to the code, where code and data are the same.  Which is why I also like Postscript -- it does the same thing but in an RPN style (a function is actually an executable array).",1345071357

4388753,comment,4388339,4388633,2,0,boyter,,,"For one reason the definition of rape in Sweden is rather interesting. There is no concept of consent rather the accusation is apparently based on the amount of violence. All a woman has to do is resist for there to be a rape case and prove so. The result is that generally it seems to be all the court needs to do is believe the woman. Hence you could have the case of there being what happens a lot in other countries, a boozy night out, consensual sex, followed by remorse the next day. However you can then charge the man with rape. It's this fuzzy line that usually throws out rape cases (In Australia at least, and this is not necessarily a good thing) where alcohol was shown to be involved.<p>I am not a lawyer, and not that familiar with Swedish law, but I would be Assange or his lawyer is, and is also aware that if the women are really working on behalf of some other agency there is a high likely hood of Swedish law working against him. If that's the case he is unlikely to get a fair hearing.<p>NB if someone more familiar with Swedish law could speak up about this that would be excellent. I would love some corrections about the above with supported documentation.<p>BTW as an Aussie I am horrified that our PM Julia Gillard condemned him without any proof, and even more furious over their lack of involvement to help an Australian national.

Asking someone like this to think about how the reason it came to be ""off"" affects how fast it will be ready for them later is a fool's errand.

All very good advice.<p>Just one thing:<p>> introductory texts [...] University Physics by Young, Freedman, and Ford [...] to learn calculus, Calculus by Larson and Edwards [...] should take you a year or two to consume [...]<p>I disagree. Two years? I think six months should be enough time for the modern youth to learn all of first year physics, calc one and two included.<p>The only limiting factor is the time it takes to do the exercises, because, like you said, the main part of learning physics happens when you are figuring things out on your own. I bet that one or two semesters with a good book with exercises with answers in the back can be enough to learn how to use  all of first year math and physics. If only there were such a book that teaches calculus, mechanics, E&M and linear algebra, all in one sitting. ;)<p>I will close on a personal recommendation from 1914.

They want the best from both fast but hard C++ and elegant but slow Python.<p>Rust aims at low level, close to hardware, as fast as possible programs, thus fine tuning for memory management (arenas, isolated GCs, choice between GC and non-gc allocation), thus disallowance of implicit copying even at cost of making language a bit harder etc. They want to fix memory unsafety and bad concurrency problems of C and C++ while keeping all the perks which are the reasons why those languages are still used for new software.<p>I imagine the choice will be like between C++11 and Java today: one's a bit faster and less memory greedy, the other's a bit easier, and each will have niches where the other is strongly unwanted.",1345068172

I have had to actively learn about body language cues for all sorts of situations. I can now do it reasonably well, but I have to pay attention a bit and do it consciously.  Some people can't learn this, but they are pretty rare, and it is pretty obvious that they have problems with it, and as such, a wider leeway is given by most people out of compassion.",1345068142

4388485,comment,4387127,4387967,5,0,rganguly,,,"""the point of business is to make money"" - YES YES YES. Couldn't agree more on this. In the midst of all the noise about how focusing on revenues and profits is besides the point because you need to get tons of user adoption, it's nice use the word BUSINESS over and over and over. We're independent BUSINESS owners, creating BUSINESSES in order to remain independent, to work on what we love and believe in with people we respect and adore. Ignoring that we have to make money, that the math needs to work out favorably and that we owe it to our teammates and employees is not going to end well. Take responsibility for building a BUSINESS not a feel-good hobby.",1345068093

Nor do I find it to be relevant.  This isn't about ""is it harder to be a guy or a girl,"" it's about the fact that it's tough to be a guy OR a girl.   IOW, women aren't the only ones who have challenges when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex.  And I don't believe it makes sense to look at the challenges that either sex has, in a vacuum.  We're all in this together.  We need more shared understanding that goes in both directions, not more antagonism.",1345068081

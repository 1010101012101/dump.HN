That&#x27;s about how long it&#x27;s been since the earliest stirrings of civilization. We&#x27;ve gone from the discovery of electrons to present-day technology in ~1.2% of that time.<p>A lot could happen in that time to reverse society to near-subsistence levels. Wars, climate change, major impact events.<p>It&#x27;s also notable that we have only the faintest insight into anyone other than the two main characters, who are of indeterminate age, education, and experience. They might easily be teenagers. Go find a bunch of 16-year-olds of average intelligence in 2013. What do they really know about the world around them? If you ask them to name a sea which might be realistically drained and refilled, what will they say?<p>Now imagine their lives having been spent in 40-person village effectively knocked back a couple hundred years, focused on farming and fishing and just generally getting by.<p>Humanity might be aware of a great deal.

The doctor is familiar with the drugs he prescribes, sure, but may not be at all familiar with the drugs that your other doctor prescribed. That is, your dermatologist knows all about dermatology drugs, but may not know much about your blood pressure or antidepressant medicine (in particular, that one of those drugs has a bad interaction with the dermatology medicine he&#x27;s prescribing).<p>That&#x27;s also why it&#x27;s important to always go to the same pharmacy if you can.

6116541,comment,6115727,6116183,9,0,Joeri,,,"Maybe we&#x27;ve got it backwards. The only true problem in software development is miscommunication, and the bigger teams get the worse they perform per-programmer, with the most productivity loss experienced by the most senior team members. On large teams, the most experienced team members are often handicapped by having to operate in a context that remains comprehensible for junior team members, investing so much time in communication that they spend not luch of it on building things. that in turn produces a sort of lowest common denominator effect, where designs are deliberatey kept overly simplistic so they will be easy to communicate.<p>The more expertise is applied to a solution, the less likely it is that people can cooperate on that codebase. The languages and frameworks of today try to minimize the need for expertise to get things done, because expertise doesn&#x27;t blend well with communicating about code. I think part of the ideas in the article is that by running away from expertise we have often arrived at inefficient solutions. We scale out, with huge codebases that are like cities, sprawling and vast yet with each component isolated and easy to comprehend. Learning from the masters means understanding complex ideas which are based on scaling up, on building a project-specific grammar that encapsulates the problem domain so elegantly that it allows for one line features, at the expense of being incomprehensible to someone new to the codebase or the field.",1375015730

You don&#x27;t like Obama.<p>Beyond that, you are simply backing into your conclusion that he was no differerent. Sure, if you take every piece of anyone&#x27;s life and look for a cynical explanation, you can find it. I mean, John Kerry&#x27;s Purple Hearts were turned into badges of shame. And, you see no evidence that Obama has ever been the victim of racial discrimination when he told you he has. You just see what fits your conclusion. But, you haven&#x27;t been with him every day of his life. Of course, if he did share more of such details, you would accuse him of &quot;fomenting more racism&quot; and of being an &quot;opportunist&quot;.<p>And that was my point in bringing up his Zimmerman comments. He was sharing some of his experience with all of us, with regard to what it is like to be an African-American man. Of course this is a different set of experiences from any other president we have had. That was relevant to the original point. Again, you missed that point and started ranting about why <i>you thought</i> he made those comments.<p>You say you don&#x27;t know Obama&#x27;s heart, yet you are certain that he became a community organizer for fully political purposes and didn&#x27;t care about the people in the community. You say that every emotional utterance that comes out of the man&#x27;s mouth is political. He is a sociopathic robot (although he may be &quot;warm&quot; in his personal life). You offer no evidence to support this and, in fact, state yourself that you cannot know the man&#x27;s heart. Yet, you are so certain that you&#x27;re right because you and Fox News say so. You bring no evidence. Just conjecture and conclusions.<p>Look, I cannot know what&#x27;s in his head or heart, and I certainly have had my own disappointments with this president. But, it is ridiculous to assert that there wasn&#x27;t anything different about this man or that it was unreasonable for people to have a hope that he was actually different. Again, even in giving his &quot;biography&quot; you magically hit upon everything that makes the man different, but say it is unremarkable. I didn&#x27;t choose the items you ticked off. You did. And, in doing so, you outlined the same rationale as the &quot;believers&quot;. You just drew a different conclusion AND you&#x27;re aided by hindsight.<p>Even his opponents fed into the notion with all of this fear mongering about socialism, &quot;taking their country back&quot;, etc. They painted him as this &quot;other&quot; of which we should all be afraid. Of course, it backfired as it helped to sell the idea that maybe this man really would be transformational. Hell, they even tried to trot out those same tired lines about socialism, etc. in 2012 when it was clear that he wasn&#x27;t the bogeyman they made him out to be.<p>You can stick your head in the sand and pretend that the atmosphere in 2008 was other than what it was.

Today&#x27;s network and its core protocols are trivial to abuse, and the trouble lies in the fact that the people that were its original creators couldn&#x27;t see the future. Jon Postel created SMTP at a time when governments were more trusted to act in the interests of the people (whether this was true in practice or not), and also only ~200 hosts were connected to the internet with a total of ~20,000 people actually using the internet.[0] Nobody thought that SMTP would be used by a large chunk of the world&#x27;s population, that spam would be an issue, that traffic could be sniffed and intercepted, or that governments would start programs of virtually indiscriminate en masse surveillance of the world&#x27;s electronic communications. The idea of a Room 614A would have been regarded as ridiculous and excessively paranoid.<p>Cloud services are an entirely different issue, and the issue isn&#x27;t necessarily resolved politically, but by mass decentralization. Things like OwnCloud are a great starting point and people today generally have the bandwidth to run their own micro-servers at home, or, possible, if battery life improves, on their phones. Some things are impossible to decentralize, for example search, at least until technology and storage advances sufficiently that we can all host our own Google search product on our phones, and Google search becomes an app that can be paid for and downloaded, with live changes to the index being streamed to the device.

6116441,comment,6116243,6116243,7,0,michaelt,,,"1. If at all possible, don&#x27;t store credit card numbers in your database. A payment gateway will take care of this for you - you have an iframe the user uses to submit their credit card details straight to the payment gateway, and the payment gateway gives you back a token you can use to charge and refund at your convenience (locked to your merchant account so not useful to attackers). DataCash and Chase Paymentech are two companies that provide this service, and I&#x27;m sure there are others too.<p>2. If the user forgets their password and resets it, ask them to re-enter their credit card details in case their e-mail has been hacked. (Also ask them to re-enter their details for deliveries to new postal addresses, if applicable)<p>So if you can&#x27;t access CC data after a customer resets their password, that&#x27;s no problem.<p>3. Use database-level security; set up roles and accounts in your database so tables containing sensitive data only have select grants to apps and users that really need them. When a table has some columns that are sensitive and others that aren&#x27;t, set up a view with the sensitive columns replaced with placeholder data and give them access to that instead.",1375013227

Before bootstrap sites designed by me looked very well on Mosaic :-)<p>ii) If I work with a designer I need to spec a lot of details (bullets, headings, columns, colors) and how the fit together. With bootstrap I know that I can change what I don&#x27;t like.<p>iii) I can then talk with a designer to only change what I don&#x27;t like.

In this case someone is sharing knowledge that could be useful to many people. Just because something is written in a man page, does that mean it should be locked away to only those intrepid enough to read the man pages of every tool they use? Community curated knowledge is useful.<p>As well, I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re intending to, but you&#x27;re coming off as an elitist asshole. Not knowing an esoteric bit of what is essentially ssh trivia does not make someone a neophyte.

If you stopped now would it improve the situation? Probably not. So get ready to launch, launch it, talk your book, make some cash. You can still build those features with some paying customers. Stop coding, start cold calling. Thats what I will be doing come Sept whether it be potential clients for the startup or potential clients for contract work.<p>I get by, by not thinking about it. Spend 2 hours thinking about the worst possible outcome, you blow all your money/credit/etc, and have zero income. Then think about what you will do. Now you have a plan.

I would be interested in seeing something like you've suggested though, essentially coming up with a ""trust"" system for different libraries.<p>At the same time, you have the experience available to test whether a gem runs on 1.8 or 1.9, where a new developer doesn't know how to read stack traces yet. Providing one-on-one support helps tackle this issue (RailsMentors.org), as would increased tutorials that try and _limit_ the range of choice, rather than overload the developer with too much.<p>Of course, these are just my own thoughts on how we can address the problem.

Academic publishing is one obvious one and the Elsevier boycott is a strong indication that this is well underway.<p>Data collection and sensing is another, which with the new class of cheap networked devices like the Rasperry Pi, as well as pads and smartphones, could well be something that is worth putting some thought into.<p>Distributed computing and mass collaboration is another obvious one, however it seems that academics can often get this more or less for free, if you look at examples like folding@home and the NASA moon crater identification project thingy, so there might not be so much requirement for things like EC2 or mechanical turk, when compared to getting people to donate resources for nothing.",1336579157

The upper education system in particular remains very good in most places and is <i>completely free</i>. I attend the University of Buenos Aires and can attest to this, even though I'm by no means a top student. The resources aren't abundant, but the quality of the education itself is excellent.<p>Lastly, the government is forcefully <i>buying</i> the oil company that used to be state-owned until the early 90s neoliberal selling spree happened. It's not like it's arbitrarily taking companies by force. I think there's some kind of consensus in economics about oil being a strategic resource, so I'm not sure it's fair to extrapolate from this one data point.",1336578945

As much as I'd prefer it all be open, the only way to send a message is to work in their sphere. Contracts between publishers and libraries exist in the conference rooms, decided by committees.

Their next goal is to avoid acquisition long enough to make a difference.

You're ""acquiring assets"" and not caring about money? What? Some make the argument that Google bought youtube for a big sum, and use that to justify Facebook buying Instagram for $1 billion, but clearly this is not sustainable.<p>For the ""acquiring Instagram for a billion"" stage to continue (proving there isn't a bubble), acquiring company needs:<p>- To be doing 3 figure millions/billions in revenue (there are only so many of these)<p>- Have a really clear idea of what they're buying and why (Yahoo sucks at this)<p>- Have patient shareholders that allow you can take huge bets like Instagram (if Zuck went off and negotiated the purchase of Instagram without board approval and Facebook was a public company, I'd imagine the shareholders would scream blue murder and possibly sue).<p>All this is fine and well, but as you note it distorts people's thinking - people use the dollar figure per user from the Instagram deal, which only is applicable IF the above conditions are met (i.e. you are bought by someone who's buying you for something other than financial reasons.

Again: launched on templates, did fine.<p>HN overvalues design expertise.

I wish designers the best.<p>But: design is one of those things that keeps people from shipping their apps, or sometimes even from starting on it. The belief that a poorly designed rev1 app will destroy the prospects of a new business has harmed more startups than inadequate design ever will.

3948913,comment,3946008,3946225,3,0,lusr,,,"That's one way to look at it.  Another is that Shark Tank is <i>itself</i> a business and they're taking a risk putting you on TV;  if you don't generate interest, the show could get cancelled because of poor ratings.  In effect, they are <i>investing</i> in you and the success of your product, and I don't see why it's unfair they receive a return on your potential subsequent success.<p>The last episode of Shark Tank had 6 million viewers [1].  If we pick $1/thousand impressions as a reasonable advertising cost, you'd have to spend $600K for 6 million impressions.  It's difficult to overstate how good this deal is.  That's what you'd be looking at paying for a Google ad that is displayed for a few seconds while a user searches or reads a page (not even looking at your ad).  On Shark Tank you're holding people's <i>direct</i> attention for 5-15min.<p>For you to start losing money, ABC would need to take > 600K out of your business.  At 5% equity, that equates to $12 million in <i>distributable</i> net profits.  Let's say the life-time of your business is 10 years - that's $1.2 million net profit distributed to shareholders/year.  To redistribute $1.2 million/year you're looking at (one imagines) at least 4 times that in net profit before taxes, i.e. $4.8 million.  If your net profit margin is an optimistic and very healthy 30% that's $16 million revenue/year.<p>To be generating $16m revenue/year makes you a pretty successful business and the chances are if you got to that point it's because you were on Shark Tank.  Very few people grow a business to that size without spending substantially more than 600K on advertising and investment.<p>At that point, assuming you still own 65% of the business (you negotiated 30% away to Shark), you're pulling in 780K (65% of $1.2m) per year vs. ABC's 60K/year.  And this is a bad deal?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Shark_Tank_(TV_series)_episodes#Season_Three:_2012"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Shark_Tank_(TV_series)_...</a>",1336576282

His ""Birth of the Cool"" music, for example, really wasn't very popular at the time he did it. As I recall, the recordings weren't even released until years later, because it just wasn't expected to be well-received. In retrospect, it was great music, and helped set the stage for a whole sub-genre of jazz.<p>He was also adept at discovering / identifying great up-and-coming musicians and associating himself with them, to the benefit of both parties.",1336575823

3948875,comment,3948299,3948511,2,0,rralian,,,"Trust isn't necessarily about grudges or emotions. Microsoft has had a long history of being very web-developer un-friendly; providing terrible tools for debugging, making it very difficult to test different browser versions, not implementing features that developers asked for because users (who wouldn't know about them) weren't asking for them, turning old browser versions into mandatorily legacy software (abandoned on old operating systems... like windows 2000, XP, etc.), not doing more to encourage people to upgrade, and just building a bad browser.<p>Mozilla, google, apple, and opera, have shown that it doesn't need to be this way. They have put in the effort to earn the trust of developers. Microsoft has not. Microsoft has shown a pattern of not listening to or caring about the web developer community. They seem to have not viewed their browser as a product in itself, but rather a tool to help sell their operating systems. All other concerns are secondary. That means web developers (or let's be honest, even users) have not been top of mind in the strategy that has traditionally been applied to Internet Explorer... corporate strategy has. That's fine, it's their prerogative to do so. They've had the market position to use IE as that kind of tool. Other companies playing the underdog have instead had to build their browsers and manage their strategy to provide the best possible product in order to win market share. I TRUST that they understand it is in their interest to do so.<p>Is Microsoft starting to play catch-up? Yes, and that's great... I hope they continue to do so. But they have not EARNED my trust that they have my interests as a web developer (or even a user) as their top priority. IE9 is a good effort, but it just hasn't been out for very long. I need to see a longer history of improvement and earnestly creating the best product and listening to developers. I believe their best interests are now served by building the best possible product... I just need to see more track record before I TRUST that they understand this.",1336575790

Either approach can reap enormous gains, if you get the timing right.  Which shakes out to: broad bets are little different from gambling.<p>And I think investment shouldn't be gambling.  As such, the 'best' (in my terms) approach to a bubble would be to hold onto your money while it grows.  Then, when it bursts, pounce on the depressed prices of the good investments.<p>It appears to me that Buffet learned that lesson after the dot-com bust and has been executing that plan on grand scale since 2008.",1336575691

We are looking for a modern shared hosting provider(similar to WebFaction) with following features.<p><pre><code>    - ability to run  PHP, Python, Ruby apps
    - provides shell access, git, etc.
    - Has nice reseller control panel 
    - we should be able to give access to clients individually as well

Earning reseller money is not the main reason for us, but ability to manage our clients from single control panel and give our clients access controlled control panel.<p>Thanks!",1336575629

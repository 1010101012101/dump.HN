Among an august audience like HN people might have more discipline to properly grok the code they're copying, but I know of plenty of places where people will just copy and paste disparate chunks of tutorial code into their editor then start randomly changing lines and variables (with a hundred questions demanded of the poor folks in some irc channel) until it sort-of-but-not-quite works. Forcing people to write it from scratch, having had the construction demonstrated, seems to aid the  mental digestion of the code much better. That's just my anecdotal experience anyway.",1343746725

They are continuously falling apart. Poor humidity and temperature control takes its toll on them, the soundboard wears out, the tuning pegs wear out, all of that felt most definitely ages and wears out and stiffens, they're full of moving parts, and even letting them get too far out of tune will damage them long-term.<p>Most of those eighty-year-old instruments really <i>aren't</i> worth keeping, and if you want your instrument to live to be eighty in good condition you need to budget for ongoing maintenance, and then eventually get the thing torn down and rebuilt. It's like owning a car.<p>It's hard, though, because I remember playing with my late grandmother's piano when I was around five years old, and now it's probably in a landfill somewhere. On the other hand, I still have my grandfather's slide rule, which he took to meteorology school at MIT during World War II.

Consider strenuous activities like exercise and sex. Oftentimes, the breakthroughs here follow directly after the activity while falling back to a rest state.<p>Finally, consider periods of sustained intense activity like marathon running. I have a close friend who runs them regularly who has remarked that she gets some of her best ideas during her runs.

So I try to build some simple web products that are useful but don't need full-time commitment or actual business/legal work. Mostly single function websites.<p>The problem is I repeatedly find myself with a typical CRUD application. They are useful to build but they don't satisfy me as I just end up dealing with UI over simple CRUD problems. Examples are to-do apps, expense tracking and bookmarking apps.<p>These are great applications but since they are highly consumer facing, the challenge mainly boils down to decent UI/UX and support for multiple devices, etc... makes sense if you are a real business but not very enjoyable to deal with browser issues and web forms as side projects.<p>On the other hand I see people building great libraries for developers. This allows them to focus on a bigger challenge and build something a little more useful/meaningful. I've programmed for years but still I don't think I'm at the level to write libraries for other developers either.<p>So my question to you is what are some relatively easy, non-CRUD or non-UI/UX oriented problems do you think I could tackle?<p>Perhaps a small library that you think would be nice to have?

How can you create a system that preserves the anonymity of publishers in persecution situations but excludes the child pornographers? The difficulty comes down to the fact that there is no technical difference between the two classes of publisher, just a moral one. Suppose the persecuted wants to share pictures of children being abused by government forces?<p>One idea I had was for the system to be semi-anonymous. Publishers would form public groups and the publication of content comes from the group as a collective. The members of each group are known, but the specific originator of the content within the group is not. This is the spartacus model of anonymity :)",1343744348

Some people still need to serve hundreds of thousands of requests via a caching frontend layer <i>separate</i> from their CDN origin. It's silly to assume you will never need a fast web server, because unless you aren't serving dynamic content, you <i>will</i> be serving content yourself and the rate will be consistent with the number of users, among other things.<p>Using a CDN does not actually simplify production deployment, it complicates it. It's an extra layer of complexity, and one you don't know very much about since it isn't your gear. You need an API hook (or a web interface) to invalidate old content when you publish new content. You need a contact with whom you can figure out why a tenth of your users can't route to the CDN all of a sudden, but can route to you. You need to get all your headers right so you don't accidentally push an invalidate to all content and kill your slow-ass origin with new traffic.<p>Finally, as someone else mentioned, using a framework webserver for production is A Bad Idea(TM). Only one of the reasons why is poor performance. Several others are security, compatibility, cache control, access control, privilege separation, stability, high-availability, virtual hosting, and about a billion other features that webservers have been designed to handle for decades that you will need to reinvent the wheel for with your application framework, which was never intended to be a webserver.<p>The reason your framework has a webserver is it's the simplest way to get the dynamic content from the app server to the frontend proxy. For example, AJP is such a huge pain in the ass that most Tomcat admins I know use http to communicate between app server and frontend (and it's more compatible).

4317284,comment,4317060,4317060,7,0,danso,,,"Call me disenchanted, but Square ports to iOS have been little more than bald, lazy attempts to cash in on years-old, sometimes decade-old properties. And I'm not talking about the original games, I'm talking about the <i>ports</i> (usually for PS1/2/X and Nintendo handhelds) being 10+ years old. Virtually every Square iOS port so far has dismal controls and little thought given to adapting to touch-based conventions...Making Retina-optimized text is about the biggest adaptation they've managed.<p>For these properties, they charge premium-based prices. For iOS, they don't make them universal...which as a business decision is fine, if unpopular. But they delay the iPad versions for months for inexplicable reasons, but I guess there will be fans who'll pay another $10+ for the new version.<p>So I don't think the porting of FF3, widely considered one of the worst of the early Final Fantasies, to be much more than another cash-in by Square.<p>* as cdr noted, the language to market this Ouya port is a bit hyped and misleading: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4317397"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4317397</a>",1343743724

Sure, in this one company's case bots may be the problem; but in general, it's detecting behavior that you are paying for that doesn't make you any money. There may be real users who click ""like"" a lot; they may do it because they're paid, or they may do it because they're bored and trying to see how many ""likes"" they can collect. It doesn't really matter; none of them are very valuable to an advertiser.<p>Rather than trying to explicitly filter bot traffic, they should try to quantify the value of particular ""likes"". For instance, a user who demonstrably clicked through and purchased something is much more valuable than one who ""likes"" 10,000 companies and has no friends, whether or not they're a bot.<p>And heck; a bot that has thousands of followers who all buy lots of things is valuable too. Maybe someone created a particularly effective meme-generator bot, and people who follow that bot are likely to buy ironic T-shirts. Whether or not a user is a bot isn't all that relevant; it's whether that user's activity correlates with you making sales.",1343743610

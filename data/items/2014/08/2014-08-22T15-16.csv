8212630,comment,8211246,8211590,5,0,Steko,,,"The printing press was certainly an accelerant but itself was a culmination of centuries of progress in Europe not shared elsewhere. Other alphabets and alpha-syllabaries in Eastern Europe, India and the Islamic world didn&#x27;t lead to printing because they lacked the maturing technology and tradition of movable type that Europe had in the centuries before Gutenberg (cf. Medieval letter tiles, Prufening dedicatory inscription, etc.).  Even in Gutenberg&#x27;s time there were other goldsmiths making nearly identical advances in Holland and France.<p>More importantly, two centuries before Gutenberg, scholars in Western Europe had thrown off the shackles of believing antiquity had all the answers, something many parts of the world still struggle with. This is sometimes credited to the rediscovery of Aristotle but the Persians and Arabs knew Aristotle and never made that leap. Instead Aristotle is simply another accelerant. What actually led Europe (and specifically Western Europe) to science was the development, from Catholic cathedral schools to pseudo-independent, credential granting institutions of learning which encouraged adding to previous knowledge and, because of this, specialization. Six hundred years before Gutenberg these proto-universities had already formalized specialized programs with separate credentials for studies in theology, philosophy and medicine.<p>Previous academies that investigated the natural world were simply not resilient institutions; tending to decline under weak central rulers (Gondeshapur in Iran, Baghdad&#x27;s House of Wisdom), be obliterated in war (House of Wisdom again, Plato&#x27;s Academy) or fade after the passing of famous founders. Many also lacked a professional faculty and credential granting, further limiting long term innovation.<p>Western Europe&#x27;s fractured political map and separation of religious power in the papacy worked against these tendencies.  The independence and progress of local universities was always to the benefit of local rulers and at the same time the universities enjoyed an association with the church that helped protect them from both obliteration after military conquest and excessive domination by the state.  This independence has to be one of the biggest keys because China&#x27;s Imperial Academy had both amazing resilience and degree granting so it&#x27;s inability to develop any kind of formal science has to be blamed on the strong subjugation to the central government which used it strictly to train civil servants. The most learned men of China were interested in the natural world, they engaged in scientism (cf. Shen Kuo&#x27;s proto-geomorphism 800 years before Lyell) but they were essentially all self-taught hobbyists.",1408722931

Issuing banks collect lists of credit cards that have issued chargebacks.  A merchant may be able to purchase access to this list from their merchant bank.<p>This is sort of a big hammer for a merchant to bring out: it will probably not catch any stolen cards (since those would have been cancelled as soon as the fraud was detected, before the chargeback was even processed), and it will simply block customers who have made a chargeback, without any idea of fault.<p>The only people who would ever use this, one would presume, are at a very high risk for chargebacks and on the verge of having their merchant accounts cancelled.  For example: &quot;web sites with monthly, recurring subscriptions&quot;.

Only the compiler can. So you can pass Ruby&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;puts &#x27;hello world&#x27;&quot; around, which you can&#x27;t in Ruby.<p>So the distinction is quite clear.<p>> Programs written in C, Python, Ruby, ML, R, and Brainfuck only have side effects when you execute them.<p>They clearly <i>don&#x27;t</i>. That&#x27;s why when I write in Ruby:<p>puts &quot;hello world&quot;<p>Then the next line of code will be executed <i>in a world where &#x27;hello world&#x27; has</i> already <i>been printed to the screen</i>.<p>Likewise, when in Ruby I write:<p>a = 5<p>a += 1<p>Then the next line of code will be executed <i>in a world where a is 6</i>.<p>So every line of code you write depends on the side-effects that came before it. Therefore, Ruby and most other languages have side-effects before code is executed. This is <i>not</i> the case in Haskell. Hence, no side-effects.",1408722132

One of the things I was initially skeptical of React about is its lack of support for custom event bubbling (which is the technique I like to use to keep my components decoupled).<p>Flux lets you cheat around that:  Since you&#x27;re using require statements, you can make an action and `require()` it in both the component it&#x27;s dispatched from and the one that&#x27;s listening to it.<p><pre><code>    // Traditional event bubbling\n    child.dispatchEvent(...) ----> parent.addEventListener(...)\n    \n    // Reflux\n    child:action() ----> store.listenTo(action) ----> store.trigger(data) ----> parent.listenTo(store)\n</code></pre>\nThe store is an extra layer of abstraction, so you can assimilate data from different sources (user interaction, server events, etc) into one format before passing them into your datastream.  Facebook&#x27;s Flux has yet another layer of abstraction called the Dispatcher.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m murky on the utility of the Store and even less confident in the utility of the Dispatcher.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m using Reflux instead of FBFlux, and I&#x27;m still tempted to skip the store and just listen to my actions from the parent component.",1408721502

So the knee can&#x27;t be removed without changing the meaning of the equation.<p>Oh, well -- as it turns out, there are many very common differential equations that resist conversion to closed form. Orbital systems with more than two bodies are a classic example. Another one is the integral to the common exponential function that gives us the normal distribution -- very commonly used in statistics and elsewhere, but no closed form. All applications of the normal distribution use a numerical algorithm called the &quot;error function&quot; to produce results -- all of them approximate, and having the drawback that they cannot be symbolically differentiated or integrated.<p>Maybe a much more skilled mathematician that I am could find a way around this obstacle, but I doubt it.",1408720821

That&#x27;s probably hard, but maybe doable now. If possible, take a large picture and crop it down to something interesting.<p>Then, just leave a camera running continuously. Put it on your hat or hang it from your neck or something. Automatically save all the &quot;interesting&quot; shots. Then you have <i>your</i> pictures, but have been able to pay attention to what&#x27;s going on around you rather than to the camera.",1408719601

Also, Lua is not object-oriented, but it's  trivial to build on the core semantics to make it OO, when doing so would be a practical approach to the problem at hand. (As far as the iteration concern, everything in Lua besides unboxed primitives is a (pseudo-hash) table.)<p>> But I don't know how to make iteration on any of these look equivalent without making the core of the language be more object oriented.<p>Haskell's typeclasses would work, as well, and in practice seem to generalize far better. Instead of restricting the iterator used to a specific type, restrict it to any type that supports the interface of iteration. (It's kind of like duck-typing that is verified at compile-time.) It sounds like Clojure has a similar mechanism.",1225033177

So you end up with a two-tiered situation.<p>Doesn't seem like that is a healthy situation in general.<p>Speaking of more complex ways of categorizing and rewarding business and employees reminds me of my recent interaction with a local government that had a ""start-up"" type program in place. I asked about office space and maybe some shared services -- something like an incubator. They were very friendly: I immediately received a 40-page packet by email which was so detailed as to be incomprehensible. (For instance, parking fees were waived up to a certain point, or alternatively fees could be reduced without a limit if I used an office that was farther away). It was like reading a report put together by every aspect of local government, each trying to help but actually making the presentation so complicated it would take an expert system to use or compare it to other offers.",1225032109

344287,comment,343693,344222,0,0,davidw,,,"Many European countries have tried to introduce different ways of being 'flexible'.  Often there is a cutoff for company size, the age of the employee, that kind of thing.  A small company may have less requirements in terms of hiring/firing.  Also, in recent years, various countries have attempted to introduce different types of contracts.  By way of example, Italy has 'standard' contracts, which are the 'real difficult to fire' kind, and the new flexible sort, which are meant to be used for more flexible positions.<p>What has happened in practice is that newer workers, wherever possible, are hired up with the flexible contracts, which generally offer nothing in the way of severance pay or anything - less than you'd get in the US in most 'good' jobs.  Older workers are hired with the standard contracts.  This creates a two-tier system with lots of unhealthy side effects.<p>I have no idea how the details work out in France.",1225031159

It's a hard thing to do, and most people who try make a mess of things.</i><p>I agree here.  Most people think fixing CL means making ""let"" use fewer parenthesis.  (Clojure does this.)<p>Anyone that has used Lisp for more than 30 seconds knows that this is not a particularly worthwhile change.  More syntax characters just to save two characters in a let binding?  No thanks.<p>(BTW, you can always use destructuring-bind instead of let -- (destructuring-bind (foo bar baz) '(1 2 3) ...).  There, you saved some parens!)<p>Honestly, Clojure doesn't sit really well with me.  It tries to be different from both CL and Scheme simply for the sake of being different, which is pretty annoying.  For example, look at the ""definers"".  In CL, the scheme is pretty simple -- defun, defvar, defgeneric, defmethod, ...  In Scheme, ""define"" is polymorphic, so it's all you ever need.  In Clojure, the ""definers"" are just random words; def/defn, etc.  Oh boy, we saved 3 characters!  I am going to be so much more productive now!<p>Anyway, I will stick to CL for now.",1225030753

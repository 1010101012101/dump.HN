8225796,comment,8224469,8225742,8,0,nostrademons,,,"Dylan started out with a prefix syntax; the infix syntax was added on late in its development at Apple, because it was believed the market wasn&#x27;t willing to adopt a prefix-syntaxed language.  Turns out it didn&#x27;t matter very much.<p>Dylan also standardized and simplified <i>a lot</i> of the dark, twisty corners of Common Lisp.  Generic functions became a core part of the language, rather than something bolted on by ad-hoc macro packages.  The collections API was unified to use generic functions (so no more mapc/mapcar/mapcan/mapl/maplist/mapcon mess), and the language syntax&#x27;s infix operators were all defined in terms of generic functions as well, so you could eg. define a matrix type and have + and * work on it as expected.  The superclass linearization was fixed to be monotonic.  Macros are hygienic.  It&#x27;s a Lisp-1, and everything in the language is an object bound to a name.<p>Honestly, I think its lack of success came down to a Worse-is-Better problem.  Dylan is a <i>really</i> nice language, designed by a committee with a combined total of over 2 centuries of Common Lisp experience.  But it doesn&#x27;t excel in any one domain.  It&#x27;s a large language, fairly complicated, which tried to mainstream a number of features with complex interactions and limited applicability.  To an outsider, who doesn&#x27;t understand those features or how they might be useful, it&#x27;s too hard to pick up in a weekend.  And so simpler languages like Scheme, Go, Python, or Erlang steal its thunder - they lack the total power of Dylan, but you can point to Scheme and say &quot;Small composable building blocks&quot;, or Go and &quot;Fast concurrency with quick, simple deployment&quot;, or Python and &quot;Prototype anything, with batteries included&quot;, or Erlang and &quot;Reliable message-passing concurrency.&quot;  If you point to Dylan and try to describe it in one sentence, you get &quot;Generic functions all the way down&quot;, which means nothing to the average programmer.<p>It&#x27;s much the same problem that Scala faces, except that Scala features JVM interop and so Scala advocates can say &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s language features with yesterday&#x27;s Java code.&quot;",1409029138

Mississippi doesn&#x27;t need the same minimum wage as Massachusetts.</i><p>You call that &quot;united&quot;?<p>We were just talking about why that approach sucks here in Canada for health care. The cost of health care is paid for by the province (state) you live in. Once you&#x27;re not in that province for 3 months, they won&#x27;t pay for it, so you have to register in the new province.<p>That&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;ve moving province to province, but what happens when you leave the country for > 3 months? You have no health care, and you won&#x27;t have any till you&#x27;ve been back for more than 3 months.<p>Compare that to Australia, where Health Care is federal, and you always have it, end of discussion. I haven&#x27;t been there for 8 years, I could fly back tomorrow and get full coverage.<p>Apply this to 10 thousand other nuances like education, driving licenses, etc. etc. and even little things become a pain in the ass - i.e. My car has a crack in the windshield which is perfectly legal and insured in state X, but as soon as I drive in to state Y I&#x27;m breaking some law... uh.

8225714,comment,8224412,8224692,6,0,dredmorbius,,,"There are a <i>lot</i> of holes in modern mainstream economic thinking, a large number of which are actually pretty old.  We&#x27;ve been having what are fundamentally the same economic debates for 2000+ years, largely over fairness of pricing, wages, equity, and control, as a survey history such as Roger E. Backhouse&#x27;s <i>The Ordinary Business of Life</i> details.<p>In the 20th century, the three major challenges to free-market capitalism as espoused by Adam Smith and his followers have been the Great Depression of 1929-1940, the environmental and oil shocks of the 1970s, and the &quot;Great Recession&quot; of 2007 onwards.<p>The Depression raised the question of whether or not the free market was itself self-correcting, and the answer is generally accepted as a pretty emphatic &quot;no&quot;.  It wasn&#x27;t until massive amounts of government-induced spending, partially through the New Deal, but largely as part of World War II and post-war reconstruction efforts (e.g., the Marshall Plan) that the economy really got off the ground again, and even through the 1950s and 1960s, there was concern that the malaise of the 1930s would return.<p>What happened instead were a series of environmental and safety concerns -- Rachel Carson&#x27;s <i>Silent Spring</i>, Ralph Nader&#x27;s <i>Unsafe at Any Speed</i>, and more so the question of whether or not the modern post-Industrial Revolution age was sustainable:  the Club of Rome&#x27;s <i>Limits to Growth</i>.<p>These were immediately followed by peaking of US domestic oil extraction in 1971, and the first <i>effective</i> middle-east oil embargo from the recently-formed OPEC (several earlier attempts had been made, notably during the Suez crisis of the 1950s, but US domestic extraction could take up the slack).  It was also a decade in which the last vestiges of the gold standard were removed from most major world currencies (the Swiss Franc continued through the 2000s), with the cancellation of the Bretton Woods agreement, unilaterally, by the US.<p>The turbulent 1970s turned into the prosperous 1980s and 1990s, which some attribute to opening up of the North Sea, Alaskan North Slope, and offshore Gulf of Mexico to oil development.  Crashing oil prices are thought to have played a major role in the collapse of the former Soviet Union, long dependent on its oil exports for hard currency.<p>There were also massive political shifts underway.  Within the US, the previously white-Democratically-dominated South was split amongst a now black Democratic and white Republic party, while moral and other issues were used to create unity amongst an otherwise increasingly class-divided Republican party elsewhere.  Labor unions lost a huge amount of power both due to general decline among US manufacturing companies (particularly automobiles, steel, and other heavy industry), as well as federal action (the 1980s air traffic controllers&#x27; strike and dissolving of the union by President Reagan).<p>While real returns on business investment were falling (look up Deloitte&#x27;s Center for the Edge study &quot;The Shift Index&quot;), financial wealth creation was increasingly coming from the financial sector itself, and asset inflation of securities and later, real estate (itself driven by securities return demands).<p>There has been economic growth, mostly in the BRIC nations:  Brazil, Russia, India, and China, but most especially in the latter two, with growth in China quite simply blowing away any previous economic revival anywhere, including the post-WWII European and Japanese recoveries.  Unfortunately for economics, the growth in India and China has come largely with an almost precise parallel growth in primary energy consumption, a huge portion of that exceptionally dirty coal (in both traditional particulate, smog, and heavy-metal pollution as well as CO2 emissions).  Much of the &quot;economic decoupling&quot; of growth from primary resource consumption in the rest of the world disappears if you factor India and China back into the equation.<p>Then came the 2000s:  the dot com collapse, the Bush tax cuts (favoring the wealthy markedly), two unfunded wars, peak oil in 2006, the housing (asset) bubble, 2007 global financial crisis, and growing inequality worldwide.<p>To put it bluntly, conventional economics predicted little if any of this.  The models of the Limits to Growth types appear to be playing out, though with some variance (the post-oil embargo efficiency improvements and reduced oil consumption, as well as fracking and other &quot;enhanced recovery&quot; petroleum extraction methods have pushed back the net fossil hydrocarbon liquids by 5-15 years).  The criticisms of Marx, Malthus, Toynbee, and others over the inequality of capitalism have resurfaced with a vengeance.  Claims of a &quot;new&quot; economy or &quot;information&quot; economy are proving largely illusory.  The Web 2.0 economy is largely funded by advertising, the bulk of which are FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) and electronics consumables themselves, as well as exceptionally liberal central bank monetary policy.<p>And the critics of economics are mainstream:  you&#x27;ll find articles questioning received wisdom in the Financial Times, Economist, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and elsewhere.  Critics include Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, James Galbraith, Steve Keen, Herman Daly, and a handful of others -- hardly the bulk of the profession, but some key thinkers.<p>And as others have noted, &quot;anti-capitalist&quot; is at best a label of convenience applied to a system that could be characterized by a great many things.  I&#x27;ve called it the economic orthodoxy (as opposed to heterodoxies).  Salient characteristics include free markets, laissez-faire (according to some), corporatism, financialization, globalization, commoditization, computerization, automation, extraction, nonsustainability, and others.<p>All of which tends to be a bit of a mouthful.  There&#x27;s also a fair bit of disagreement among critics on just what the most relevant elements of failure are (as is typically the case -- it&#x27;s easy to agree that you don&#x27;t like the old boss, harder to select a new boss you happen to agree on).",1409026695

8225710,comment,8221854,8224814,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> I am not accusing anyone of being a bigot. However, it would be silly to assume that there are not cultural and social biases about gender that you and I grow up with and have, even if we don&#x27;t realize it. That is what I am getting at: this isn&#x27;t some accusation, but that statement definitely has a connotation about what it means to be a particular gender.<p>The words you&#x27;re using could be applied to anything. We&#x27;re culturally biased to believe that murder, rape and slavery are wrong, that free speech and self-determination are virtuous, etc. So your point has to be that the bias is not only present but incorrect. The problem is that&#x27;s the political question which is in dispute. People aren&#x27;t inherently wrong just because they disagree with you.<p>> Gender is not your genes and there is a difference between sex and gender.<p>This is what I&#x27;m talking about. &quot;Gender&quot; and &quot;genes&quot; have the same root. Several of the definitions of &quot;gender&quot; in the dictionary list it as a synonym for sex. You&#x27;re trying to claim that sex and gender mean (materially) different things because that allows you to more easily distinguish one from the other. So you&#x27;re essentially using gender as a term of art. Which is fine until you start trying to tell everyone else that your meaning is the only meaning.<p>> You are implying that trans people being able to define their identity and having their identity accepted is a niche thing that isn&#x27;t relevant to society as a whole when it most certainly is. Being able to have an identity and exist without facing violence and hardship is important no matter how numerically small a population is.<p>The problem is the cultural bias goes both ways. Most of society will assume that someone referred to with the feminine pronoun is genetically female. When that assumption is false the use of that pronoun becomes inherently misleading. So you&#x27;re implicitly claiming that someone should have the right to mislead others about their sex in order to self-identify as the opposite gender. Can you at least understand how not everyone would agree with that conclusion?<p>And there is a mile wide gap between disagreeing over which words to use to describe someone and committing violence against them.<p>> I think you missed the point of what Newspeak is. Correcting false assumptions and stereotypes about gender is not about limiting discussion or dialog. Further, there is no way that trans communities are even close to being in a position of political power and influence, being able to have their identity without that identity being challenged just because they exist isn&#x27;t an attempt to suppress people.<p>A majority or position of power is not necessary to enforce conformity to an ideal. All it requires is dedication and repetition. More to the point, if you don&#x27;t think it can be effective then why are you doing it?",1409026506

Someone, wreck my career some more.<p>Unlike Dylan Erlang was created by a company for a purpose with very clear goals and it did and still excels at meeting those goals, and nothing out there gets close to the qualities it has. Not everyone needs those qualities, but sometimes nothing will do. Erlang is at the core of many solid industrial applications -- mobile to internet gateways, message queues, trading systems, large databases, handling millions of concurrent connection and billions of messages per day for WhatsApp.<p>What does Dylan do? This is the second time I heard about Dylan. I&#x27;ve played with Mercury, Prolog, Nimrod, Curry (Haskell + Logic programming) and other rather obscure languages but haven&#x27;t heard about Dylan much.<p>Some languages just don&#x27;t make it, sometimes it is just luck. However I don&#x27;t like the disparaging and angry remarks thrown around at other languages and ecosystems. That does nothing to promote Dylan it only pushes people away.",1409026011
8225684,comment,8225491,8225491,6,0,millstone,,,"> In summary, a typed constant obeys all the rules of typed values in Go.<p>I think this is too optimistic. For example, you can divide by a 0 value but not by a 0 constant:<p><pre><code>    1.0 / 0.0 // compile error\n</code></pre>\nbut<p><pre><code>    zero := 0.0\n    1.0 / zero // infinity\n</code></pre>\nOr try:<p><pre><code>        foo := 0.0\n\tfmt.Printf(&quot;%f&quot;, -foo) // outputs -0.0\n        fmt.Printf(&quot;%f&quot;, -0.0) // outputs 0.0\n</code></pre>\nSo negating a zero value is different than negating a zero constant. Rather confusing.",1409025992

It means things are worse for the print media than even their current revenues suggest, because falling ad prices have been concealed by selling more ads.

If you are working on algos that can be patented you should have no trouble finding investors.<p>And if you are looking to raise 100K, and can't find any big time investors, you can always get some credit cards to eat the cost. Surely you get plenty of those offers from capital one etc for 30K @ 0% apr til Nov 2009.

You should have just sat around playing x-box, to be honest.<p>While making sure that you all have a shared short term goal is important, and that every step forward is towards that goal, trying to plan out every what if situation is a futile exercise that can be extended indefinitely.<p>Deal with ""what if's"" when you see them over the immediate horizon, not before you even start your project. You will not encounter 90% of them, and most of the ones you do encounter won't fall into any category you're dreaming up now.<p>Figure out an end state, agree on a short term goal and get to work.

373280,comment,373064,373064,0,0,lee,,,"Speaking as someone who was a beneficiary of several talent/need based scholarships, I'd like to suggest a slight refactoring of your problem. Allow me to invoke Gladwell. Think of this as trying to help someone get their 10,000 hours in to become an expert.<p>I was lucky in that I received scholarships to 'be' at a prestigious schools or programs, but always had to work at jobs much more than my peers not only because of my family's need, but also because of my family's attitudes about what children were for. The wealthy kids' families had a much different idea of how to raise a child than my family did and they had a different understanding of the types of resources beyond the financial that kids need to be successful.<p>Just because I had received a scholarship to excellent schools did not release me from the expectation that I needed to contribute financially to my parents' well-being while I was in high school and college. In fact, it increased their expectations.<p>The pressure was intense. I knew that the only way for me to get out and to stay out was to do well academically, but relinquishing duty was anathema. The schools where I went were hard, with heavy academic workloads, and having to work around 35-40 hours a week through high school and college and keep strong academic standing extremely stressful and time consuming. Very difficult to get the 10,000 hours in when you're asking people if they want fries with that.<p>Kids need time.<p>If it's as all possible, interview the families of the most likely candidates. Look for red flags. Will the parents be able to afford or allow the child to actually reap the benefits you're offering? If they can't afford it, are they willing to give the child extra time to pursue academics more seriously or are they likely to consume their young?<p>When you do give out the scholarship, please spend time with the family to help them structure the student's life so they can properly take advantage of what you're giving them.",1227396851

373271,comment,372471,372893,0,0,kscaldef,,,">  Though I have read that some equatins regarding sub atomic particles were ""too difficult to solve"" before, I never had read a good explanation why.<p>Solution to the equations of quantum field theory can be formally expressed using what's called a perturbation expansion.  This is similar to using a power series expansion to solve an algebraic or differential equation.  In a rough way of looking at things, higher order terms in the expansion correspond to particle interactions with more ""stuff"" involved.  This equivalence is what Feynman diagrams represent.<p>In the case of electromagnetism, this technique is very effective.  The term corresponding to a single photon exchange is 137 times larger than the term corresponding to two photons, and so on.  As a result, perturbation theory works very well for these calculations.<p>However, for nuclear forces in a proton or neutron, all the terms are about the same size.  You can't cut off the expansion and get a meaningful estimate.  In the Feynman diagram view, this is saying that you can't think of it as just exchanges of small numbers of gluons, rather, you'd need to consider huge number of particles and diagrams of extreme complexity.  This is the sense in which the equations are ""too difficult to solve"".  You need to do something totally different from perturbation theory to get a solution.  Lattice computations, as described in the article, are the best alternative technique we have available at this point.",1227395773

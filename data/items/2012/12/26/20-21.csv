PIN-based encryption is the solution for now, but an invisible attack could be dangerous (though the attack's you mention through the USB key require a rooted phone with permissions allowed, which is not common- privilege escalation attacks are one vector which we still have to work against)<p>We think what we have right now is a big improvement over the status quo, and that we still have a lot of room to keep getting better.

A lot of C++ code I've seen has tried to move heaven and earth to ensure that mistakes are impossible, at the cost of introducing a lot of rather expensive (time to write, time to execute, time to maintain) infrastructure - or baggage, if you're unkind - that also make things unclear in the debugger.<p>This isn't quite a waste of time, but it's been my own experience that it's cheaper to just make things as straightforward as you can, then simply ask everybody to try not to make mistakes. Often you can build in systems that make it easy to diagnose problems when they occur, or just rely on people's debugging skills. Some programmers consider this a total cop-out - they're right, I should be ashamed - but I've found the overall TCO to be lower.<p>You might have to find this out the hard way to believe it.<p>The worst thing is that some people think the alternative should be C ;)",1356555248

Especially in a community of people <i>I'd</i> think would be taking things apart just to learn how they work.<p>> Why should you know how an internal combustion engine works in order to drive a car?<p>Easyso when you go to a mechanic with an exhaust blockage and he tries to sell you a new transmission, you know enough to tell him where to stick his transmission.<p>Yes, this actually happened to me. Thankfully, I knew enough about cars to know I needed another mechanic.<p>Obviously not every driver needs to be an automotive engineer or even a technician, but it's a little silly to throw up your hands and give up on knowing anything when the basics aren't that hard to understand.<p>> What's the point in knowing the effects of compiled and interpreted code on portability when so many other factors could make that basic knowledge irrelevant?<p>At first, I thought ""the effects of compiled and interpreted code on portability"" was an absurd thing to talk about. Compiled vs. interpreted is a pretty fuzzy distinction (Java is compiled, but only to bytecode that's then interpreted, but that interpreter just just-in-time compiles to native code anyway), and a compiled language doesn't inherently mean you're stuck on one CPU or OS until you rewrite your whole applicationsometimes you just need to recompile it.

The problem we have with it is that it's an absolute pain to maintain in a large production.<p>The setup alone is just bizarre, for each replica set you have to have 3 (and only 3!) config server instances associated with your set, along with possibly an ""arbiter"" instance depending on what circumstances you're operating under. I could do a whole rant (and have, in the past, to anyone who would listen) on the arbiter/voting system mongo uses. We've been left in a situation in the past where one of our secondaries randomly died (more on these lovely ""random occurences"" later), leaving the cluster with a master and an arbiter left over. Mongo decided that since there was an even number of votes (and why is my production-critical database voting on things?!) it couldn't promote a master (even though the master never actually died), dropped the master down to being read-only, leaving us completely boned. They have since fixed this issue (I think), but it definitely garnered a lot of ill-will from me, and should never EVER have even been a problem.<p>""Random occurrences"" have always plagued us with mongo. Whether it's been random segfaults (less common with more recent versions, but oh dear god were they frequent pre-2.0), secondaries being promoted to master with no clear reason as to what sparked this (which has left us flailing twice now, when a master decided to step down while one secondary was in RECOVERING mode and the other was AWOL), config servers getting out of sync (one time one of the config server sets decided it was going to start hosting the config for an entirely different replica set, luckily no production mongos instances had to reload the config before we noticed), mongos instances getting out of sync/crashing (less common now than before, thankfully), and I'm sure much more that I'm not thinking of now.<p>To make all of the above about 10x worse the mongo logs are terrible. There is no distinction between INFO messages and ERROR messages in the logs, so everything has to be treated as an error of some kind. And there are many ""errors"" that we should ""just ignore"". This makes debugging pretty much impossible. Another nice feature is when you restart a mongos instance (and possibly a mongod instance too, although I could be wrong on that) all the logs from the old process get clobbered by the new one (so backup those logs folks!). It's extremely difficult to track down why slow queries are happening unless you can catch them in the act, and even then it's not trivial.<p>Mongo has many great qualities. It's one of the few (if the only, that I know of) that can do many of the things that it does, and for that it's very useful. But for it to have been marketed as a production-ready database was a bit disingenuous I think. It scales OK. Not well, just OK. You can make it scale if you try real hard and tiptoe around it so you don't wake it up and make it cry. I think someday in the future all of these issues will be fixed, but at the moment I don't recommend anyone use mongo for anything they plan on a significant number (200k+ users at any given moment) of users being dependent on.",1356554629

Passwords are an incredibly difficult problem to solve, and trying to solve it takes gumption. I love getting individual websites out of the authentication game; delegated auth is a much better solution when it works right, IMO.<p>That said, what makes this quantitatively different from just using challenge-response authentication directly in the browser via a browser extension? Private keys may be password (""PIN"") protected, and must be possessed by the authenticating user. In both cases, any compromise of the private key means you're owned.<p>Exploits like the Defcon ""charging station"" proof-of-concept and the recently-discussed Galaxy S3 DMA hole should make people extremely wary of putting all their authentication eggs in their mobile phone's basket. People will plug anything into their charging-port-that-also-transmits-data if it gives them enough juice to get throughout the day; this is a MASSIVE social engineering problem waiting to happen if something like Clef were to become commonplace.<p>This solves at least some of the problems of passwords (too short, often re-used), but comes with new ones (4-digit PINs are hilariously easy to crack, and can often be guessed manually if a touchscreen is involved; private key theft via malware leaves you in big trouble and you may never know it happened), and I worry that marketing it as a solution to all your password woes is a bit ambitious.",1356554561

For almost every modern project I've worked on, the combination of a powerful C library collection and the Lua VM wrapper to make it all scriptable has been absolutely unbeatable.<p>Sure, I write Python .. I've done more than my share of Ruby projects, and I could definitely spend a few years working in pure C++ if it were necessary.  But the point is that none of these languages have been necessary recently, with my Lua+C skills ..",1356553303

Saying nothing about the substance of the argument or whether their data source appropriately classifies what counts as this kind of crime, the methodology is on the right track but not optimal.<p>Of course binning the events by year throws away data about specific timing.  Having actual event times would allow fitting a hazard rate model.<p>There are two simple alternative hypotheses - explanations for a deviation from the Poisson assumption.  What they're calling ""random"" is really ""occuring at a homogeneous rate;"" so we have to ask - as opposed to what?<p>1) clustering/overdispersion, because the events happen more often alongside each other (copycat effect or whatever; risk of a new event is a function of time since last event)<p>2) secular trend (the rate of events is changing over time)<p>We can't really distinguish between these two without explicitly modeling, and it doesn't look like we have enough data to do that.  The tool to do it would be a generalized linear model with an overdispersed Poisson dependent variable.<p>It's kind of bad form to estimate the Poisson mean from the data, and then use that to fit the distribution you're testing against.  You're using the data twice, so the p-value isn't what you think it is.\nYou should be conditioning on the total number of events in the sample.<p>Also, chi-square distribution comparison is for large samples.  This is a meh-kinda-borderline-midsize sample, to use a technical term.<p>The test they want that has neither of these problems is Fisher's exact test for equal proportions.  \nIf the events were generated by a Poisson process, the number in each year would be conditionally binomial, and they'd add up to the total observed event count.  The test is: is the data explained by all the years getting events randomly at the same rate (null hypothesis) vs. each year having its own rate (alt hypothesis).<p>And finally, yes, you get a p-value.  But you also need to think about the power of the test detect an anomaly if there was one (type II error).  For something like this, you could do power analysis by a simple simulation, but you'd need to specify what kind of anomaly you'd want power to detect (e.g. all events cluster together in one year, to pick an extreme).<p>Otherwise, all you have is a design that has a correct p-value.  If you reject the null hypothesis at 5%, but you have low power, you might as well toss a coin and declare the data ""nonrandom"" 5% of of the time.  This might be as good a test as we can get with the data available, but p-value isn't the only thing you can look at.",1356553292

Most of the direct references are not from experiment but based on observations of effective work environments.<p>You linked to a claim for skepticism, but did not mention the the extensive counter-examples from the first commenter, at least as it applies to some subfields of work. The quote I find most persuasive is: ""The best data on sustained intellectual activity comes from financially independent authors. While completing a novel famous authors tend to write only for 4 hr during the morning, leaving the rest of the day for rest and recuperation.""<p>That is a strong suggestion that 4 hours of creative work is about the daily limit. Why is this not a sufficient counter-argument for a broad ""60 hour is optimal"" recommendation? After all, a self-supporting author has good economic inventive to create more works, but this puts a limit of 28 hours per week on creative work.<p>Your second link is based on the Nov. 2001 newsletter of ""a national firm of Construction Consultants and Claims Specialists, assisting owners and contractors in achieving profitable and trouble-free construction projects"", and not, say, a peer-reviewed journal or research organization. The newsletters most recent citation is from 1992, so a bit over 20 years old, instead of a bit over 60 that you are disdainful about.<p>Can you find anything more recent, and research-oriented, which provides better evidence for your ""60 hours is optimal"" suggestion? In your analysis, please note, as the newsletter points out, that ""The fatigue resulting from a daily two-hour commute is considered similar to a daily increase of two working hours."", so you can't look at a 40 hour work-week in the City of London and assume that that's the only factor to consider, if the commute takes an hour each way. (The newsletter highlights this because in some construction jobs the crew is housed on-site, so there is no commute, which makes the direct interpretation of the chart results difficult.)<p>Because the overcomingbias.com references didn't include more recent, and more academic/research oriented papers, I suspect both it and you did insufficient research.<p>In any case, I don't think you understand the math of the evidence that you report. The contracting job numbers say that it's better to hire 1.25x people, who work 40 hours per week, than it is to hire 1x people who work 60 hours per week. Assuming the cost per hour are equal - which it often is for hourly construction work - then the first gives the company more productivity for the same cost.<p>The only way that 60 hours per week is optimal for the company is if the workers are paid constant rates no matter how much they work per day, or if it wasn't possible to hire 25% more workers (e.g., because of the size of the site, or number of hours available to work). But that's not good incentive to get people to work longer hours, is it.<p>So I don't understand how you drew your conclusion that 60 hours is optimal.<p>Here are some of the more recent (post-1940s) papers on this topic, quoting from the CDC, which is one of the top Google hits for this topic, at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/workschedules/abstracts/dawson.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/workschedules/abstracts/daws...</a> :<p>> Few studies have directly investigated the financial consequences of long working hours. For example, in a study on white-collar jobs, performance decreased by as much as 20% when 60 or more weekly hours are worked (Nevison, 1992). Data from 18 manufacturing industries in the U.S. show that a 10% increase in overtime resulted, on average, in a 2.4% decrease in productivity measured by hourly output ( Shepard and Clifton, 2000). High overtime levels can cause poor employee morale, which can affect productivity and absenteeism. For example, Circadian showed that 31% of extended hours operations that have extremely high overtime hours (25% or greater) also had poor morale, compared to only 13% of companies with low or normal overtime (Kerin, 2003). Long working hours and overtime contribute to increased worker fatigue and safety problems. For example, the average cost of workers compensation claimed per individual at extended hours facilities that reported severe fatigue problems was considerably higher ($4,037) than at facilities that report moderate ($2,240), minor ($981) or no ($276) fatigue problems (Figure 4) (Kerin, 2004).<p>Note that productivity is only one of the factors. Health costs, impact on family life, and accident claims are others (though the last can be included in the productivity numbers, as they seem to be for the construction numbers).<p>The Shepard and Clifton paper uses post-1940s data, and would be a better reference than the newsletter. I'm not paying for access to the full paper. You?<p>Again, don't misinterpret the 2.4% decrease from 40- to 60-hours-per-week to say that working 60 hours is better for the company than 40. If the employees are paid per hour, than it's better to hire more people than it is to have the same people work overtime. (Again, ignoring secondary effects; perhaps the factory isn't large enough for 25% more people.) Plus, the employees will have better morale, and bad morale decreases productivity.<p>Another, more modern review (and definitely better than a company newsletter) is ""Working Long Hours:\nA Review of the Evidence, Volume 1"" (2003), from the Institute for Employment Studies in the UK  ( <a href=""http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/emar/errs16vol1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.dti.g...</a> ). It references ""Bienefeld (1972) who observed that major reductions in hours in British economic history preceded rather than followed peaks of productivity growth"", though ""this evidence may disputed."" Still, I find nothing in there which gives strength to your ""60 hours is optimal"" suggestion. If anything, most of the research is aimed at determining if 35 is a more optimal number than 40.<p>Based on your termination of our previous exchange on the similarity of employment to a monopoly, I'm not surprised that your analysis seems weak. Your math seems wrong and your citations poor. (BTW, in that monopoly thread I've cited several economics papers which explore the model I outlined, and the developers of that model received the 2010 Nobel Prize in economics. I've also cited several papers which use the factors that you say you've never seen in economics models. This supports my belief that your analysis seems weak.)",1356552418

For example, if you query some range on an index with upper and lower bounds (like age > 18 && age < 50) it can not use both bounds on the index. That's been driving me crazy on some queries and I had to use hacky indexes. It's not a bug though, it's the query syntax and data model causing these kind of behaviour.

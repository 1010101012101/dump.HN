Small communities have actually had very good success in strong-arming telecom with the exclusivity contract.

Suppose the paper announcing this discovery was full of terms like ""discrimination"" and ""fairness,"" and speculated about who or what was to ""blame"" for treating men in this discriminatory way.<p>Would the politically enlightened consider this increased association of men with arrest records (vs women) to be unfair bias against men? Would there be a call for a followup to determine whether it was a biased algorithm, a discriminatory corporation, or our entire anti-male sexist society that was to blame? Might they shrug it off, placing most of the blame, not on the ad system, but on the statistical behavior of men themselves?<p>If there is, as I suspect, a similar ""bias"" against men in this ad system, then any discussion of how to ""fix"" it should not address the question of black/white names. It ought to deal with the larger question of what to do when the data show that the probability of X given name 'A' is greater than the probability of X given name 'B'.",1360018735

They lose on issues like SOPA that receive any sort of public attention, because they don't have a populist message. Both sides of the aisle* have basically abandoned them looking for the next grassroots internet issue.<p>And this isn't that high of a hurdle. We already secured similar compulsory distribution rights for radio and cable without any concerted lobbying effort, because it's a really common sense solution that benefits consumers and producers. There's not as much legislative or judicial inertia on these issues as it might seem.<p>As to cost, Netflix is spending $100 M per show and doing 5 shows a year (maybe the others are significantly less?). But for just 0.3% of one show per year, you get a top lobbying firm. I'd be willing to bet other distributors would pitch in to defray the cost.<p>That's more pressure than this issue has ever seen, and it's an issue that's already been won in other domains. Given that history, I don't think it'd take more than two years of effort. Maybe five?<p>While Netflix is seeing revenues of just under a billion dollars a quarter, they'll be fine for a while.<p>Pricing: <a href=""http://lobbying101.wordpress.com/about-lobbyists/how-much-do-they-charge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lobbying101.wordpress.com/about-lobbyists/how-much-do...</a><p>*UPDATE: I should have said ""some individuals from both sides of the aisle,"" I didn't mean to claim the MPAA has lost all support, just that cracks are starting to show.",1360018723

The only point the article makes about lobbying is that it interferes with our current mechanism that is supposed to allow regulators to breaking up companies that are too big or that the Administration can just decide not to prosecute any cases.<p>If companies are naturally downsized by market/tax forces then they won't be lobbying to maintain their monolithic state. Rather then the financial engineers in the companies working out perverse ways to keep ""profit"" low, they instead have to focus on carving themselves into optimally-sized independent units.

Further, I'll also step forward as someone who also deals regularly with crippling depression; being more open about it is what I've resolved to do after Aaron's suicide, and the suicide in November of one of my clients. (I've written only a very little about it before, <a href=""http://www.robsheldon.com/blog/depression-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robsheldon.com/blog/depression-programming/</a>)<p>You're absolutely right that we can be sneaky. A huge part of that is the stigma associated with depression. I'm <i>certain</i> that if all of my clients knew about it, I'd lose some of them for the simple fact that they'd consider me unreliable in the long term.<p>So, when Taren mentioned that she'd been ""reading up"" on depression, and concluded that that wasn't what Aaron was suffering from, I did cringe a little. I came to the comments here expecting to find some discussion of depression; what I <i>didn't</i> expect was the top comment completely dismissing Aaron's suicide as being <i>only</i> about depression.<p>Depression is probably different for different people, like most things. Mine simply makes me more susceptible to struggling when life gets hard. I'm rarely depressed when the sun is shining and there's money in the bank account and my car is working and my business is good and my friends and family are happy. When too many of those things are off, I feel it intensely and my default biochemical response is to crawl into a hole and want to disappear. I have to fight my way back out of that, every time.<p>So I find Aaron's case very easy to empathize with. If I were in his situation -- inasmuch as I understand his situation at this point -- I'm honestly not sure what I would do. I can tell you that I'd feel overpowered, hopeless, and defeated. I can also tell you that I would want to punch anyone in the face who said that if I chose to commit suicide as a result of the situation, it would be primarily because of my depression.",1360018288

I cannot blame the present generation for not having it, but I agree with what you say; I just cannot attach blame to it. It doesn't seem to me they have the desire for greatness; they lack the courage to do it. But we had, because we were in a favorable circumstance to have it; we just came through a tremendously successful war. In the war we were looking very, very bad for a long while; it was a very desperate struggle as you well know. And our success, I think, gave us courage and self confidence; that's why you see, beginning in the late forties through the fifties, a tremendous productivity at the labs which was stimulated from the earlier times. Because many of us were earlier forced to learn other things - we were forced to learn the things we didn't want to learn, we were forced to have an open door - and then we could exploit those things we learned. It is true, and I can't do anything about it; I cannot blame the present generation either. It's just a fact. </i><p><a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html</a> - the best essay on doing great work that I know of.",1360018277

Now that I'm hustling out there I feel like I should have just been hustling all along instead of taking a detour that I don't think made a difference in the long run.

(and this post doesn't intend to argue Aaron was depressed, just thinks about the premise that he might have been)<p>As someone who suffers a lot with depression, it is quite possible to be depressed <i>and for no one close to you to notice</i>. We can be damn good at hiding it, especially with practice, especially with people we know well.<p>Some time ago I was living with my partner and she had no clue I had been depressed for months. Then we went out with a couple we hadn't seen for a little while, and afterwards the  girl took my partner aside and asked if I was OK.<p>Taren obviously knows him best, and I agree that if she says Aaron wouldn't have committed suicide if it weren't for the case then clearly that is true. However, I think she is dismissing the impact of depression, or at least dismissing the possibility, to readily. You could turn around and suggest that if he hadn't been in depression (if indeed he was) then the case may have not driven him to suicide.<p>Depression is a horrible, and terrible thing. Those close to depressed individuals certainly have a lot of insight, but it is still nearly impossible to communicate what it is like even to them.<p>EDIT: I'm cautious to add this, because it is ""one guy on the internet"", but reading Taren's post again some of the things she describes strike me as telltale signs of secreted depression. Disappearing on a whim for a hike, for example, is a favourite of mine.<p>EDIT2: It is also worth noting she describes one common set of symptoms of depression (low activity, disinterest, etc.). However, I for one don't often get them (for example) but I do become deeply involved in subjects for periods of time before moving on. Similar to how she describes. This is a <i>very very</i> common symptom of depression and if you see a friend become obsessed with a string of new things take a second to think about how they might be.",1360016904

I cannot charge my car like I can with a gas car. I must plug it in overnight, which is impossible since I have no permanent driveway. And even if I did I would not have access to electricity for charging. I also live in New York. Here getting an electric car makes 100% sense, short driving distances, slow speeds, lots of stopping, the ideal environment for electric cars, and yet most new yorkers live in apartments/driveway-less houses not houses with driveways.<p>And I REALLY want an electric car. The savings would be great, and it would really help with the pollution in the city. But alas, it is not possible.<p>And of course driving cross-country. I have no way of filling up. It would make sense if I could pay some fee to gas stations to leech their juice while I stop there for say 15 minutes. That would turn any gas station into an electric charging staging, of course that requires the car to charge quickly.<p>And so the heart of it all: We need a REALLY - REALLY fast charging battery that can go about 100-200 miles. Once you have that, people charging weekly for ~ 15 minutes won't be such a terrible thing. And it's now practical as a car for anyone.<p>And FFS, we need low-end electric cars. Because super high-end cars like tesla will never get the adoption needed. A flood of low-end electrics would solve the problem of charge stations everywhere.",1360016413

I think good programmers should have a good basis in general knowledge, and therefore college should make you a better person.<p>I say this as someone who hasn't finished his BS Computer Science degree.  I probably have a couple of credits of CS courses to finish and some liberal arts (literally, some art classes) to finish my BS.  I have been working in the profession for over 20 years and I feel like not finishing my BS is a bit of an albatross around my neck.  Not because I feel it's holding me back, but because if I hadn't taken the courses I have taken, I wouldn't be interested in the broader subject of Computer Science.  I never would have taken that Scheme class (SICP) that some of the other students complained about because it was in a language that ""wasn't useful"" (I was curious and thoroughly enjoyed the class).  I never would have been curious about writing a B tree from scratch and learning about algorithms.  I never would have been curious about Derivatives, Integrals, and Differential Equations.

My first CS class was in 9th grade, as I recall, so I thought the target audience was secondary/high school students.<p>But it quickly lead to statements without empirical justification, like:<p>> To start, Im strong believer that when learning new, and at times complex topics its outright detrimental to overload students with frivolous syntax rules. Therefore, Enfield is designed with minimal syntax rules and whats more minimal than a Lisp like syntax.<p>Is that opinion backed by any of the decades of research on the topic? Additionally, FORTH is a more minimal syntax than Lisp, so why a Lisp-like syntax instead of a FORTH-like syntax?<p>It then went into things which made no sense for a high-school CS student, like bignums and tail recursion.<p>Only then it say ""Key to any college programming course ..""<p>Which means this is designed for an early undergraduate course for CS majors, and not what I was looking for.<p>(I work with programmers with no formal CS education. These are computational scientists. I chose first Tcl then Python in part because they are languages that non-CS majors could pick up without the ""untyped lambda calculus."" I'm interested in knowing if there's more research along these lines. Perhaps it could replace Python in the future.)<p>Perhaps for a CS major it is 'ideal' that ""an introductory course would require students to not only learn a language, but to also create an interpreter for a subset of the language using the language itself.""

But to be fair, use of foul language clearly diminishes any written statement.  \nYour commment indicates that something I said has been contradicted in recent peer reviewed research. However, your statement is completely nebulous.  What peer-reviewed research?  What points in my statements prove I'm not aware of said research?  Can you elaborate, or perhaps provide a link to said study?  I am always interested in learning more facts about this topic.",1360015335

While it would seem to make sense to make your news delivery app appear in Newsstand, it does come with some trade-offs, most significantly that your app is locked inside the Newsstand shelf and can't be placed in a primary app slot.<p>And, even if your app is in Newsstand, you have to actively go into Settings and turn on background download on an app-by-app basis.<p>Finally, even then, the app will only background-download if you're on a WiFi connection.  I agree, this makes sense in this age of metered WAN bandwidth.<p>So, if you're using iOS, there's a really good chance that you will not have that content before getting on the subway, unless you remember to click into it on the walk over to the station.",1360015218

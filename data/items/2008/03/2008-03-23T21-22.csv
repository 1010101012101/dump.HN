144108,comment,143829,143932,0,0,henning,,,"What? It's not at all clear that you can reproduce Erlang's concurrency ability in C. Someone gave a link to an untested, unknown library that hasn't been tested in real situations hardly at all and that's supposed to be equivalent to 2 MLOC codebases with 99.9999999% uptime?<p>I was suggesting it to be fair. It has not yet been demonstrated because I have not seen any benchmarks to the contrary or anything approaching real data, and certainly no instances of this occurring in real production software.<p>Thus, the opportunity to make a fair comparison never arose, so you have some work to do before you say ""thppt"".<p>The point was it's easier to get correctness in languages like Erlang, irrespective of what speed is being achieved. Of course, if you're happy with buffer overflows and core dumps, more power to you.",1206308535

144102,comment,144014,144014,0,0,phaedrus,,,"This poses an interesting question:  if you find yourself in such a position, working at a company that is doing so many things wrong, what do you do?  I can think of several different things, but which is right?<p>1.  Easy way out - go with the flow and add your own WTFery to the mix, and try not to let it destroy your soul.<p>2. Fight for what's right at every turn, and stand up to the status quo.<p>3. Pay lip service to the status quo, but subtly and sneakily introduce best practices one at a time.  It would be an uphill battle, and hard to fight backsliding without blowing the undercover nature of your cleanup operation.  In order to do this, you'd have to find the coworkers who still have a bit of a soul that hasn't been crushed, and get them on your side to help you.",1206307677

Hmm.. what incentive does this create?<p>- One time capital gains tax exemption for the sale of a home:  This encourages people to sell their home and then buy a more expensive home, even if a less expensive one would have sufficed.<p>- The implicit federal bailout of Fannie and Freddie:  These companies underwrite a lot of the more risky mortgages and as long as there is an expectation that the government will bail them out, nobody looks too closely at their soundness.<p>These are the regulations that got us into trouble in the first place.<p>Now is the time for less regulation, not more!",1206306833

They all were pretty much like the one in the article. I always wondered why they were such big failures. Obviously, the incompetent local manager, but they failed too spectacularly for this to be the only reason. Now I start to think this kind of culture actively rejects competent people. Even if they stay with the company for a while, they're never promoted to a position where they can use their skill.",1206306825

The guy from Germany made the big mistake of not hiring the right people in the first place, so he's completely responsible for the mess, but as far as the firing goes, it's her decision. His job was to bring experience, fresh air and make waves - and he was brought in for this purpose by Johann. At the very least Jola should have held a big long exit interview with him, since she knew already that the company was in trouble.",1206306454

144087,comment,143735,143735,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Paul, I don't think you get it though.<p>I've got to say here that I read the essay with the same distaste as Atwood, particularly because of its opening paragraphs. I loved the message, and agree with the theory, but I had a tough time with the presentation.<p>The connotation that it isn't natural to be an employee and as such those that do are by extension ""unnatural"" is troubling. I realize that you're not saying ""all corporate programmers suck"", but clearly, people who have the courage, will, and sheer balls to found their own companies have a unique talent that isn't shared by all.<p>Of course, the programmers you work with are in perfect harmony with startup life. For them, having a boss is not the way to go. They need to be entrepreneurs. It's in their being.<p>Some people though, are perfectly happy being employees. These people should not be starting their own companies. They should continue to enjoy life and have fun on their corporate scavenger hunts. They are innately different than the startup founder. That much is obvious.<p>To extend and equate this difference with being ""lesser"" - whether by choice, ignorance, or chance - is where you run into trouble with a lot of us. You're inserting a good/bad comparison into an exercise that should remain strictly an examination of difference. Hence, Atwood's suggestion of narcissism.<p>Of course being a founder is ""natural"" to you. I've learned that it is to me as well, and no doubt it's natural to everyone on this site.<p>Sure, a lot of people that work for corporations should look to embrace startups, especially those that are disgruntled. No, startup founders are not a select few geniuses; they are those of a given talents. Surely you of all people realize this.  To suggest that everyone shares these talents, or that those who don't are somehow misguided sounds more like religion than business though.<p>Finally, I don't even think this post was needed. This post suggests that a great many people who read the essay didn't understand it, due to their lack of intellect. In fact, it is more likely that they understood it perfectly, and the problem lies more with how the author chose to support the thesis.",1206306314

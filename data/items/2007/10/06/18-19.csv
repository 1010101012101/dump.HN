I think the 'reddit this' links must have been the biggest factor in reddit's decline. Interesting to see he joined the RDF group, also with some objection.",1191696057

And they pioneered the ideas behind dynamic languages like Ruby. Before there was Matz or Larry there was Alan Kay and Guy Steele.<p>What would we do without computer science researchers?",1191695925

However, it's since been shown there's a lot of money to be made, and lately PG's been spreading the gospel about how entrepreneurship is the true calling of a geek. But it's just not always the case.<p>Anyway, even if your premise about Aaron is true, the man's already done more with his short life than almost anybody on this site. Even on the business side. <p>For some reason Aaron feels compelled to talk out almost every personal failing he has in public. I don't know, if the famously mercurial Steve Jobs or Larry Ellison actually recounted all of their meltdowns candidly, they might sound something like Aaron's blog.",1191695746

64126,comment,63702,64108,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree, the Europeans to some extent are piling on America, and Americans are piling on Bush, as a convenient way of blaming someone else without doing anything themselves.  <p>That said, the Europeans were irritated with Clinton/Gore about this, and I thought it was somewhat unfair back then as well.  When the Kyoto treaty failed the first time, it almost seemed that the Europeans had deliberately constructed a flawed treaty so they could blame us for failing to ratify it.  <p>All the same, I think that Gore would have worked to overcome the negatives of this treaty and get a good agreement through.  Whereas I think Bush used it to snuff out <i>any</i> action on Global warming.  <p>California's actions can actually be used to refute some of this international criticism: California was willing to go against its own national government to get global warming legislation through - surely Australia, France, and Germancy can find a way to act without US leadership (or in spite of US opposition).<p>But my very first post was really about branding - that California may have a better international brand than the US does, partly because of this type of legislation.  I really didn't want to spin off a long debate about global warming.    \n",1191694791

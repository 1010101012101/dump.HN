9806218,comment,9803043,9803043,0,0,wiseignorant,,,"what if all this talk about the f-35 being crap has to do with some sort of russian propaganda aimed at shaping the public opinion in the west, which should eventually pressure the politicians to drop the idea of buying the f-35. Because what the &quot;Internet Age&quot; has taught me is that the world is not short of suckers, and russian propaganda knows it. 
Think of it! Putin would have a much better sleep at night if the American allies and NATO members didn&#x27;t have a stealth fighter/bomber able to penetrate the enemy lines without much problems and hitting the targets with high precision. The idea of f-35 and other stealth planes is to reduce some &quot;costs&quot;, like political cost, while still exercising your geo-political control. For instance, the Europeans countries would never send a plane to east Ukraine if there is a chance it might be shot down. Imagine a European Prime Minister saying: &quot;we sent a couple of ours f-35s, bombed the rebels, came back and opened the door for the Ukrainian army to reunify the country and bring peace&quot;; to instead saying: &quot;we sent a bunch of planes, some where shot down, some of our men were killed and the situation in east Ukraine is still not defined&quot;. The second sentence could translate into: &quot;shit! I could lose the next election&quot;.    
The russians might not admit it in public, but they are always scared about the western military superiority and economic power, particularly the USA. (Yes, I said economic power, don&#x27;t fall for the BRICS bullshit, the economic fragility of these countries is nothing compared to the fragility, that of course exists, in the developed nations). They (russians) have their own stealth fighter project, the T-50, that seems not to be working properly, besides the fact they are short of money and had to drop the number of planes they initially planed to build for the Russian air force from 52 to just 12 now. Meanwhile the f-35 is about to hit the skies, and the Americans already have almost two hundred f-22 and and 20 B-2 on top of 10 nuclear powered carriers with a bunch of f-18. 
So, I say it again, it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if the russian propaganda wants to shape public opinion to at least delay the acquisition of advanced stealth fighters/bombers by NATO members.",1435679979

Or, put another way, how you want the tables to be <i>aligned</i>.<p>Extending this to PixQL, the ON clause of a JOIN tells the engine how to align two different images, perhaps by offsets in the x,y directions. You could even extend further to LEFT,RIGHT,OUTER,INNER joins where it crops one image to the boundary of the other depending on the join type.<p>Assuming a more fleshed out FROM syntax (see my other comment) with alias support, you could select the same image multiple times but at different offsets to facilitate a blur.",1435679956

I&#x27;ve come up with my own kit of advice for friends / peers / family members who are going to be in front of an audience. Generalizations can be argued against, but in my experience, not successfully. :)<p>Every time you get in front of an audience, remember: they came to see you succeed. Nobody (whose opinion matters) goes to plays, presentations or speeches to watch the on-stage talent crash and burn.  They want to be entertained, or to be informed, or to experience catharsis. They have no reason to believe you&#x27;re not qualified to speak, and they&#x27;re subconsciously rooting for you because it is rewarding for the audience when you do well, and embarrassing for them when you do not.<p>Bring water. Take pauses every few minutes to take a drink. It helps regulate breathing.<p>Don&#x27;t use colloquialisms without crafting a turn of phrase that explains it for those who don&#x27;t understand. Don&#x27;t use pop-culture references in presentations. Your audience may know you a little from a speaker bio, but you are even less likely to know their cultural background, and the awkward silence that follows a failed &quot;Mr. Burns from The Simpsons&quot; reference will only force you to get inside your own head. Which brings me to:<p>Stay out of your head. Meaning: don&#x27;t present material that you haven&#x27;t practiced unless your particular brain excels at improvisation or social engineering, because you can&#x27;t be THINKING about all that info and your presentation skills WHILE you&#x27;re presenting. Practice speaking slowly, clearly and authoritatively, know your schedule for the talk, and KNOW YOUR SHIT ( a colloquialism meaning that you should be well-versed in the subject matter of your presentation). If you are unpracticed or only superficially aware of your subject matter, you will make mistakes that you will suddenly find yourself analyzing without your own permission. Your brain will put on the brakes, bringing your presentation to a screeching halt, and start to pick apart every little thing that happened and every little thing you&#x27;re about to do. When someone &quot;chokes&quot; during a public performance, they&#x27;ve gotten into their own head. &quot;Auto-pilot&quot; - being able to perform without conscious step-by-step thought - is your best weapon here; that only comes from an easy comfort with the material and, unless you&#x27;re already a skilled public speaker, practice.<p>TL;DR?: Your audience is rooting for you; stop and sip water frequently; don&#x27;t be a clever wordsmith (or a cunning linguist, if that helps you remember?) unless you know your audience will &quot;get it&quot;; and for the love off all that is good in the world, know the room, know the schedule and know your shit, or you&#x27;ll choke and that makes a whole room full of people feel much more uncomfortable than you, because when they sat down, they already mentally prepared for you to be good.",1435679713

I just changed the Clojure version from &quot;1.6.0&quot; to &quot;1.7.0&quot; for one of my side projects, without updating any library versions, ran it, all the tests passed, and it seems to work perfectly. It also didn&#x27;t break my Emacs setup, which is a breath of fresh air compared to how much work it was to get the Haskell tooling working with the new 7.10 GHC release (GHC-mod for instance still doesn&#x27;t have a compatible release, although the trunk mostly works with 7.10). Similarly, even though it&#x27;s months after the 7.10 release there are still libraries that don&#x27;t support it, like reactive-banana-wx, whilst a couple of the Clojure libraries I&#x27;m using haven&#x27;t been updated in over a year yet still work fine on 1.7, and none of the libraries I&#x27;m using break on 1.7.<p>To be fair, GHC and the Haskell ecosystem is far more complex than Clojure and its ecosystem/standard library. Nevertheless it&#x27;s pleasant how easy Clojure was to upgrade (although of course this stability is nothing special: more conservative languages like Go and Java generally break almost nothing on upgrade).",1435679676

In this specific case, that modification of strategy would have saved the set, perhaps, and given him a chance to continue fighting in the match. A win would be far from guaranteed, counterfactuals are hard to construct and almost always impossible to verify.<p>Tennis is a sport where you will rue every single point in a lost match. It lends itself particularly well to the if-only-I-did-that-one-thing-differently rationalization. It is due to the hierarchical (game-set-match) nature of the scoring and how one only needs to win one crucial point to get past their competitor (e.g. at 30-30, 30-15, the players are really sitting on a knife&#x27;s edge).",1435679546

You see, those in charge did not want to start a panic or look bad. They sent in firefighters without telling them what they were going into. They did not evacuate affected areas quickly enough. They did not alert neighboring regions of the fallout that was coming their way. Innocent people died because they were unable to admit their wrongdoing.

Arrays, Lists and Lazy Sequences are data structures that implement the sequence interface. There is a standard set of functions, &#x27;map&#x27;, &#x27;reduce&#x27;, &#x27;filter&#x27; that operates on that sequence interface and provide a common set of functions for different kinds of datatypes. This lets the programmer reuse code and idioms and makes programs easier to understand overall.<p>The problem is that there are datatypes, such as streams and channels, which are fundamentally sequence abstractions but for one reason or other don&#x27;t implement the &#x27;sequence&#x27; interface. You could wrap them in a lazy sequence but that can be complex and will introduce a performance penalty. When they wrote core.async, they the authors found themselves reimplementing &#x27;map&#x27;, &#x27;reduce&#x27; etc, for channels.<p>Transducers are a way to provide sequence operations to any kind of collection split the part that interfaces with the collection from the operation. This way we can dispense with the old &#x27;map&#x27;, &#x27;filter&#x27;, etc and just use transducers for everything.

This is for Safari of OS X: assuming it doesn&#x27;t crash on startup (so for me, about two out of three computers these days, up from one out of three), Safari is a piss poor browser even when it manages to run. I have a lot of code that runs incredibly slow on Safari yet has no problems in other browsers. Sometimes it drops connections randomly. Sometimes pages just crash. Sometimes it just won&#x27;t render anything. The exact same code works fine in Chrome, FF, etc. and is pretty typical angular code. In other words, it&#x27;s cross-browser code. Luckily, I don&#x27;t think we have many Safari customers and at this point, if things don&#x27;t work in Safari, the bugs I find are filed with the lowest precedence (ie: they will never get fixed) and that only because we have a person on our team who insists on using this broken browser. The lack of support for the APIs mentioned in the article only serves to drive the point home for me. The developer tools are also substandard compared to either Chrome or FF.<p>IE at least had market share. There is <i></i>nothing<i></i> that makes developing for Safari (OS X) worth the time spent.",1435678572

(The following might sound condescending, sorry; there&#x27;s no easy way to say &#x27;you&#x27;re being manipulated&#x27;. Everyone is, at various times.)<p>The F-35 is highly politicized, and that political fight takes place on the battlefield of public opinion, with both sides trying to manipulate the public with propaganda. And many here on HN are playing their roles perfectly, responding to the propaganda like mice responding to stimuli in a maze.<p>We&#x27;re all susceptable to it and I try hard to learn to recognize it. I think a good sign of propaganda is the choice of phrasing. If someone is trying to manipulate you, they often try to arouse anger and outrage -- angry people aren&#x27;t open to reasonable discussion and other opinions, so if you get people outraged on your side then they are innoculated against other arguments. You can see the lack of balanced, smart analysis and the widespread expression of outrage here. Someone trying to inform you will take a much different approach, carefully presenting information and avoiding distorting your understanding with provocation. For example, consider the phrase, &quot;New stealth fighter is dead meat in an air battle&quot; -- clearly it&#x27;s meant to arouse and not inform.<p>The article represents the analysis, abridged and without context, of one tester in one test of a system that&#x27;s in its test phase and not meant to be in production for 1.5 years. There are many other articles, representing individuals&#x27; opinions (including test pilots), some that praise the F-35 and some that criticize it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the F-35 is a good deal; I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know much at all about fighter planes (and reading the comments, I know more than many here). I don&#x27;t know if dog-fighting is relevant; maybe it&#x27;s gone the way of broadsides in combat between warships (and better dog-fighters are like Henry Ford&#x27;s &#x27;faster horses&#x27;). I don&#x27;t know if the problems described by the test pilot are bugs of a test system (that&#x27;s why we test!). Think about the state of your systems 1.5 years before production -- they may not look so great.<p>I do know that propaganda like the OP reduces public knowledge; it doesn&#x27;t increase it.<p>EDIT: Edited to be a little less obnoxious.",1435678171

I don&#x27;t have much familiarity with advanced systemd or upstart, although I have plenty of familiarity with mesos schedulers, which can be kind of a datacenter-level version of systemd, and in this instance we do &quot;rolling restarts&quot; where new instances are launched, we wait for them to pass health checks, and then we drain the old ones, while a load balancer is responsible for routing incoming connections to the healthy instances.

The old banks were put into receivership and liquidation, resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors.

Going back, it loads an image of the previous page before it actually loads the real page.  This gives the perception that it&#x27;s loaded immediately, but it&#x27;s not really loaded.  This means the page is not responsive.  It also looks fuzzy, and you can see it&#x27;s fake.  It&#x27;s horrible, and while it&#x27;s intended to fake being fast, it only serves to remind me that it&#x27;s not actually fast.<p>Then their is the problem with black boxes.  I don&#x27;t know why, but all to often, safari loads a page and there are black boxes on that page.  Just covering up portions of the web page.  I have to resize the window or do something to get Safari to rerender the page so it will go away.  This happens frequently.<p>Couple this with all the other issues OSX has, I can&#x27;t but make the assumption that Apple is focused on Quantity rather than Quality.<p>Of the 3 big browsers in Mac, Firefox is still, in my mind, the most solid.

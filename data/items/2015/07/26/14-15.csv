Knowing how to do things in the most basic, fundamental way is nourishing. And I&#x27;ve heard from many people that the JavaScript ecosystem—by which they seem to mean all the stuff they hear that everyone else is using—makes them feel overwhelmed. So it&#x27;s good to have this clear explanation of the &quot;modern&quot; tools. But it&#x27;s also good to know that it&#x27;s all optional and that you can start without them. It is entirely possible to make a modern web application with just a few plain JS files included with script tags. Yet people think the first step is to learn about half a dozen sophisticated tools that they don&#x27;t even know why they need. So I say start with Notepad.

Even Chisel doesn&#x27;t have near as many users as its successes deserve. That&#x27;s common for ASIC or FPGA tools that aren&#x27;t the big name.<p>For now, my preliminary answer is that people: (a) just use Altera and Xilinx HLS tools for FPGA because they&#x27;re cheap and work well with their products; (b) use HLS tools from big three EDA companies on ASIC design; (c) straight up do HDL (majority probably) for ASIC as experienced HW engineers are used to doing anyway and use good RTL synthesis. Against the competition, there&#x27;s no comparison of free/open synthesis tools except in price and subversion risk. Those are my reasons for investigating them, though, so I continue to get feedback on what I find.<p>Note: Not sure of your HW expertise. If you&#x27;re not a HW person, I&#x27;ll note that anything synthesized for ASIC&#x27;s needs to have a rock-solid method because mistakes are expensive.

In the former, you take several graduate level courses in a variety of CS disciplines (programming languages, distributed systems, AI, graphics).  With the latter, you generally take courses in your first year and your second year is spent doing research on a single project (with the goal to publish at least once).  These courses involve reading the seminal papers and a scattering of modern papers and working on a small project (typically implementing something from one of the papers you’ve read).<p>If you’re considering a career in academia, do a Masters.\nIf you want to understand the theoretical underpinnings of an area of CS, do a Masters.\nIf you want to take time off to experiment with different aspects of CS, do a Masters.<p>If you want to become a better developer, a Masters may not help you.<p>The code you write in your Masters is generally done solitarily.  You’ll work with other grad students on discussing papers and problems, but it’s rare to have two grad students working on the same codebase (the eternal fight for primary authorship).  As a result, there isn’t much opportunity for you to improve your coding craft by having other developers off a code review.  As well, a lot of the process and tooling employed by software companies (“Joel test” things like source control and continuous integration) are generally not applied because of limited capacity.<p>All of this said, in grad school I met students who were amazing developers despite having limited industry experience.  In industry, I met amazing research minded people, abreast of the state of the art in research, who’d never gone to graduate school.<p>Coming back full circle, what is it you hope to accomplish with a Masters degree? Fuller and deeper understanding of CS? Better development and tooling practices? Answering these questions will help you determine if a Masters is right for you.",1437921375

If the attacker did get forwarding to work - it would only forward calls not text messages (which gmail would send a recovery code via text message). According to the story it was in the process of being ported which MAY send texts to the new number - but on most accounts that I&#x27;ve read with dealing with porting that takes at least 24 hours for them to start receiving text messages on the new provider. To my knowledge no carrier has implemented text message forwarding. Also it seemed my posts were downvoted right around the time of his responses.<p>There are certain holes in this story - first it was a gmail account, then it turned into a gmail + google apps account which are 2 completely different things.<p>Regardless - enable OTP period.<p>> Surely the most secure option is simply a very strong password<p>Arguably using a different strong (12+ characters) password for every site and service is a good approach - but then you should probably be generating those passwords and storing them into a password manager. Then that password manager becomes a target[1].

If I just need something to encapsulate my test runner and packing tool invocations, then I&#x27;ll just toss those in a five-line Makefile, because why add a heavyweight build tool most of whose capabilities I&#x27;m not going to exercise?",1437919403

In every case I&#x27;ve seen an option type be used, it was always a less efficient way of approximating how Kotlin does it.<p>Kotlin has deconstruction:<p><pre><code>    val (a,b,c) = myDataObject\n</code></pre>\nTheir documentation did indeed commit this sin when I first started using Kotlin last year. It&#x27;s been cleaned up considerably and this is no longer an issue (except, I think, for the mysterious modules which appear to be an IDE specific concept).",1437919360

The biggest cost in suicide bombings directed at the developed world, is getting the bomb carrying person into location (immigration, housing), feeding the person, and the time it takes to arrange it all. Drones mean you bring one person in, and they get to take action potentially numerous times.",1437919332

I studied subjects at school that required a lot of reading, and so I probably got the practice from that. (Of course, not all texts are suitable for reading this way.)<p>What you appear to have done is: spend 10 minutes reading the article, then 5 minutes complaining about how it is unreasonable to expect anybody to read 3,000 words. 15 minutes in total. (All times are estimates.)<p>Perhaps a better course of action would be: spend 10 minutes reading the article, and then wonder perhaps how you could put its advice into practise. 15 minutes in total.<p>Suppose you take its advice to heart and immediately end up being able to do what I did and read articles such as this one in 2 minutes. Your total time investment for reading n articles (excluding this one) will then be 15+2n. Maybe it takes longer to get the hang of, and it works out as 15+5n?<p>But suppose you continue as you are - time investment for the same will be more like 15+10n. A steeper graph. (And actually, more like 20+10n, because those 5 minutes you spent complaining are now spent.)<p>I think this is the guy&#x27;s point.<p>(How do I spend the time I save? Why, by writing comments such as this, of course.)",1437919329

Also, more than one car was impacted by the slowdown so you need to look at the overall odds per person not per car and then sum then to find the collective risk of death.<p>It&#x27;s not easy to find the actual odds, but stopped cars on the freeway kill people every year with much higher risks in high speed low density high speed traffic as traffic jams tend to be safe it&#x27;s unexpected stopped cars that&#x27;s the problem.<p>Rough guess there is probably a 1:100 chance per year a car will stop in the middle of a free way for no apparent reason.  There ~100,000,000 cars on the road.  So, ~1:1,000,000 cars stop per year  which is probably low but let&#x27;s say they cause 10 deaths out of the 20,000+ auto deaths per year.  Well that&#x27;s ~1:10,000.  Now, sure you \ncan play with the odds but there much higher than 1:1,000,000.",1437919324

172684,comment,172522,172524,0,0,jrockway,,,"Reddit could have done something about this, though.  If being downmodded hurt your karma, I bet people would think twice before flaming.<p>It works here.  I avoid flaming and trolling because I like my karma to increase.  When I still read reddit, I would often troll, be overly cyncial, or generally be an ass because there was nothing to lose.  (Reddit is too mainstream for there to be any intelligence there now.  There is the occasional good comment from someone, but the good comments are way too hard to find.)",1209059726

The ideal workforce to make a country rich from technology and innovation is a well-educated, relatively free one that can experiment and be creative.  The ideal workforce to make a country rich from a natural resource is a poorly educated one that will fall in line with the regime that controls the resource. Monopolies and tyrannies are bad for hacking but great for pumping oil.",1209059562

When I first heard it, I was sceptical enough that I wrote a program to simulate it.  But once it was built, there was essentially no reason to run it.  Once you break the possible outcome into all the cases, it's clear what the success ratio will be just from looking at the algorithm.",1209059561

I'm a single founder, but while likebetter is looking more promising than ever, life dictates that I find someone else to take the reins.<p>Likebetter.com has been featured on the BBC, the front page of Digg, and in countless blogs. Traffic is decent at 30K uniques, we clearly have our share of addicts, and our widgetbox widget traffic is growing: we have just under 6K active subscriptions.<p>Most exciting: Two weeks ago, I signed a two year profit-sharing partnership agreement with the largest syndication house in the US, that seeks to promote the likebetter widget to the largest newspapers and magazines across the nation for use on their sites (pet wars, best photo contests, etc). The site will need some work to ready it for this (RoR+javascript), but the profit potential is high.<p>After working on likebetter for more than two years, I feel that it's just at the cusp of finding its stride. I'm seeking the right person or pair that can help guide it home. To be clear: I am not looking for a traditional 'cofounder'. For all intents and purposes, I'd play the role of an adviser and to some extent help cover base costs; but my other commitments won't allow me to play an active role in the development of the business nor the site.<p>If for whatever reason you applied and were not admitted to YC, or are considering applying but don't have the right idea - consider this: You'd be getting in 2 floors above the ground floor, and, to the right person, I'm prepared to hand over the same equity as if you joined me on the ground floor two years ago.<p>If this sounds like the opportunity for you, email me plusbryan AT gmail.com<p>I'm located in SF and would like to meet with you in person, though the final location of the business is of no consequence.<p>pairwise.com\nlikebetter.com",1209057063

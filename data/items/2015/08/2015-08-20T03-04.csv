10089960,comment,10089191,10089359,0,0,dang,,,"> <i>I don&#x27;t see these products as all that compelling.</i><p>Much the same reactions pop up after every batch [1], including the &quot;sign of YC decline&quot; comment elsewhere in this thread. Maybe they&#x27;re right, but we won&#x27;t know for a few years.<p>There&#x27;s one big factor here for sure though: nascent things seem trivial, so it&#x27;s easy to dismiss them. That&#x27;s the null hypothesis about dismissals—most are fully explained by it. It&#x27;s also the #1 problem of early-stage investing. pg has written about this a ton, most memorably (to me) at [2].<p>Little things are easy to belittle. Their value is hard to see, their triviality is obvious, and the vast majority turn out worthless anyhow. If your goal is to be right as often as possible, it&#x27;s a sure bet. But startup investing is all about detecting that hard-to-see value, and for that it would be a bad sign if these reactions <i>didn&#x27;t</i> pop up after every batch.<p>I do wish the HN discussions could be a little more varied, though; at our worst (or maybe our median) we mostly emit versions of &quot;No wireless, less space than a nomad, lame.&quot; But this may not be possible. Dismissals have statistics if not economics on their side, &quot;wait and see&quot; is not a compelling message board argument, and the discussions invariably have incomplete information—launch stories don&#x27;t come with the complete vision and plans of the startup nor the thought process behind the investment.<p>The habit of looking for ways that things <i>could</i> work instead of reasons they probably won&#x27;t is too rare to hold its own in a public discussion. That&#x27;s sad, though, because it&#x27;s so intimately related to the creative process, and if there&#x27;s one thing I could change about HN&#x27;s culture it would certainly be to enrich it with more of that.<p>1. <a href=""https://twitter.com/sama/status/595993931906551808"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/sama/status/595993931906551808</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/altair.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/altair.html</a>",1440043172

Thanks for the feedback<p>Edit - After reading this I just realised it could be taken as loaded with snark. Really did not want it to come across as that. Just to clarify my statement, a website which allows for people to comment on the highly polarizing issue that is &quot;what value, if any, does this new Silicon Valley funded startup X bring to the table?&quot; would probably be filled up with thoughtless/cruel comments right at the start.

HN is supposed a welcoming place for smart folks with an interest in the small intersection between tech and business.<p>It&#x27;s always felt like an implicit rule, but it&#x27;s pretty simple: don&#x27;t be a dick, and don&#x27;t discourage people from exploring ideas they think are interesting.

This could theoretically allow for more creative game development (especially in turn based games) where you might use a full blow Unity engine game for desktop/web and maybe a component attached to mobile (a side companion that gives strategy advice etc.) that would just be a native app instead of a game.<p>They&#x27;ll probably need to hustle on getting past just simple turn based games if they want to compete though. It looks like Unity&#x27;s offering is aimed at delivering on real time multiplayer as well.<p>We live in interesting times.",1440042924

10089897,comment,10089037,10089037,0,0,wbond,,,"Package Control has patched these two module issues for a while, but I figured I&#x27;d give some details for those that are interested:<p>Sublime Text 2 on Windows has an error when importing select. It isn&#x27;t that Jon didn&#x27;t include select, but rather there seems to be an issue importing the select.pyd from the folder that sublime_text.exe is located in, with Python 2.6. In fact, Python 2.6 on Windows has all sorts of issues that Jon burned a lot of time trying to work around. For instance, Python 2.6 can&#x27;t add sys.path entries for folders with non-ascii characters. This led to a hacky work-around where Sublime Text chdirs into each package folder and loads the Python from &quot;.\&quot;. Package Control solves the select import by shipping the select.pyd files, but placing them in a package folder and then adding that folder to sys.path.<p>For Linux, Python creates a _ssl.so shared library shim that links with the system&#x27;s version of OpenSSL. The downside is that different distros have different versions of OpenSSL - 0.9.x and 1.x.x. This is further compounded by the fact that Fedora has their own specially numbered version of libssl (libssl-10 instead of libssl-1.0.0). So, by distributing a compiled version of Python, there isn&#x27;t a way to ship the _ssl module for Python that will actually consistently work. Jon seems to have decided to focus his energy on other issues. Package Control patches this issue also. Actually, my SFTP package was the first to patch the issue, but I spent the time to make in generally available to all packages with Package Control 3.0.<p>So there are two options to deal with _ssl. Jon could try to ship OpenSSL with Sublime Text, thus entering the world of being responsible for patching OpenSSL, and dealing with dynamic linking issues and all that jazz. It gets kind of gross dealing with rpath and all kinds of other work to get the shared lib to look in the current folder first rather than loading the, possibly incorrect, system version of libssl. I&#x27;ve gone down that path before with a project and it was not a fun time. On a side note, Sublime Text on Windows unfortunately does ship OpenSSL, so the version available to Sublime Text plugins can be out-of-date. I&#x27;ve been working on a cross-platform crypto library for Python that uses the OS crypto facilities, which could be a solution for this in the future.<p>The other option is to rely on the system version of OpenSSL, but provide _ssl.so shims for each of the different major versions of OpenSSL for each architecture. Then ssl.py would have to be patched to try each of the shims until one of them loaded properly. The upside here is that the distro is responsible for updates to OpenSSL. This general approach is what Package Control does, however I don&#x27;t patch ssl.py. Instead Package Control adds a custom package that is listed alphabetically first, and thus loaded by Sublime Text first. This custom package tries importing each of the shims until it finds one that works with the version of OpenSSL on the system. If you are morbidly curious, you can see the code and shims at <a href=""https://github.com/codexns/sublime-ssl-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codexns/sublime-ssl-linux</a>.<p>The end result of all of this is that for the majority of ST users, these issues are likely solved. Package Control 3.0 automatically installs these fixes, and provides mechanisms for package developers to share other compiled Python modules. Older versions of Package Control have been EOLed, and thus it is possible for package developers to rely on users having these patches in place.",1440041316

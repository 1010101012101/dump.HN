7161222,comment,7160544,7161132,3,0,learc83,,,">what a great asset horses would be when both sides have used their precision missiles to take out all of the supporting infrastructure. No maintenance or fuel supply line needed, they even double as their own horse manufacturing line.<p>Think about what you&#x27;re saying for a second. It takes years and plenty of manpower and supplies to raise a horse for riding. Riding horses most definitely do not self replicate in any useful fashion or time-frame.<p>Horses are in no way useful, at scale, in modern warfare. They require far more training, manpower, and time \nper-mile-covered than a motorized vehicle. If both sides have obliterated their respective infrastructures to the point that they rely on horses, each would have long since lost the capability to wage a modern war.",1391245092

We introduced PDF evidence uploads last year (unfortunately too late to help in this case), and we&#x27;re currently exploring ways to make illegitimate chargebacks a non-issue for all our users. We&#x27;re also constantly fine-tuning our fraud detection systems which also helps reduce chargebacks across the board.<p>If you have thoughts on how we can improve this process further, we&#x27;d really appreciate hearing from you.

The supply and demand dynamics of these two stakeholder classes are in many ways decoupled from each other, especially with the current structure of academia, so there is no reason to believe that the interests of one should be so facilely used to leverage for the interests of the other.",1391242875

Although a hand-written letter probably will get read by an official&#x27;s staff. Probably ignored too; but you might get lucky.<p>Phone calls are ignored too. There are too many. And most of the calls are from &quot;professional callers&quot; - folk payed by lobbyists to call.<p>The absolute best way to lobby is to show up. In person. Either in DC, or even better, when they on the road locally. Especially during election years. NOTHING scares a politician more then a scene they can&#x27;t control at a local event.<p>Congressmen are easy to get to when on the campaign trail. Senators are harder, but not much harder. But one piece of advice.. BE PREPARED. Know what you plan to say before the meet.<p>And you&#x27;ll probably be shuffled off to a staffer. That&#x27;s ok. Really. Staffers do most of the work anyway.<p>PS: Another way to get your message out, is of course money. A nice donation to a congressman will get you a meet. You&#x27;ll get a few minutes with the congressman himself. But much more time with his staff. And if you give enough (a that level 3 or 4 thousand is more then enough) you get his top staff. And that&#x27;s the best. Of course, the higher you go, the more money it cost. Example: you can get 20 seconds of the President&#x27;s time (or his staff) if you drop 10k at certain dinners. Depending on your issue it can be money well spent.<p>By the way, the TSA is not gong away. Despite how much we all hate it. It&#x27;s a jobs program now. And theres too much money involved now.",1391242233

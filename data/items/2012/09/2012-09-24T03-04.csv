It's funny how often I run into people in the tech/science/math scene who have similar opinions. Maybe they phrase it differently -- ""Why go to college for something like English, or Art, when it's not going to be cost effective"" comes up a lot -- but the sentiment is the same. I'll leave the argument that they <i>are</i> worth studying to commenters more intelligent and more eloquent than I am, but I thought it was interesting how similar West Point and the Bay Area were in this respect.",1348459167

One of his greatest strengths was his ability to believe something <i>incredibly</i> strongly, but then to change that belief quickly (and, at times, mercurially).

4563136,comment,4562211,4562702,3,0,agentS,,,"> You have to read the comment to get the error types (isn't compiler accessible), it doesn't list what all the possible error types are (doesn't say the ones documented are exhaustive)<p>You're absolutely right. People should be able to use libraries without reading their documentation, and instead rely on compile failures to slowly iterate their code towards perfection. /s<p>Seriously, though, I believe expecting programmers to read documentation of a library they're using is a pretty low bar.<p>Also, no it doesn't list what all the possible error types are. To do this would require what amounts to checked exceptions in Java. The issues with these are relatively well known.<p>First, it complicates versioning as adding a new error type is a breaking change for all clients. When they get an error from an API, most clients either return that error verbatim, decorate that error slightly and return the decorated error, or handle a few specific error situations and return an error in all other cases. Declaring all possible error types makes your programs brittle, as it is easy for libraries you are using to break your code.<p>Second, they are a hassle for larger programs that touch many systems. It is easy to declare that you return an EntityNotFound error. But it is not so easy to declare that you return an EntityNotFound, MemcacheCASConflict, FileNotFound, FileExists, PermissionDenied, Timeout, InvalidJSON, ConnectionClosed, or TemplateRenderingFailed error. This is perfectly reasonable set of errors for a simple method that gets a value from datastore (possible caching it) decoding a field as json, and writing a template to an HTTP connection. Any 'simple' wrapper of this method then inherits all of these declarations. Now certainly with Java, IDEs will ""fill in all the forms"" for you, so this problem is a little more palatable, but Go does not require programmers to use (often heavyweight) tools to make them productive.<p>> code returns a singleton error (no state) presumably so the caller doesn't have to do a bunch of casts<p>This is a little disingenuous, as you don't really know why they made it a singleton error. I can't think of any state that would be useful in this situation, can you?<p>The Java version of this API throws an exception with a single field, the Key that could not be found. I think this is supremely unhelpful and just adds clutter to the documentation, as the user of this method clearly already has this information in hand.",1348459049

As someone who likes C and Python I understand that both ways can make robust software, and it took me a little time to accept exceptions at all. More broadly, most of the languages that are widely used can write decent software.<p>I think this is a matter of what you prefer the program to do by default, when something clearly wrong has happened, but no error-handling code has been written: you may prefer such code to halt, or you may prefer it to keep on trucking.<p>If you use exceptions, you have to think about it IF you want the program to keep on trucking. Otherwise you can just let exceptional circumstances take care of themselves - if the program stops immediately, it cannot then behave incorrectly.<p>As a default failure mode, I do prefer the program to halt and decline to further cock up the situation (forcing me and my tests to deal with the condition) than for the program to silently swallow the error and continue as a default (forcing me to thoroughly check error codes everywhere up front out of pure fear that I will miss a condition).<p>This is just a convention and either one works.<p>If Go can become a better version of C then I might switch out C for Go. This isn't by any means going to cause me to give up Python because I use C for very specific reasons (when it is totally OK for reasons of speed or control to write a decent amount more code, and have it read more cryptically, and have to take care of many more low-level details).",1348458678

As a user since 2005 back in college, I witness my peers and my Facebook usage evolve from 'a social network with personal sharing' to a 'bare wall with a few instagram picture uploads / article sharing, and essentially a contact list'.  It's sad, but inevitable - how personal can sharing be, when the friends list is over 1000 and some of whom are no longer actively in your life?  Of course no one is to blame but the user (myself) that added too many friends.  However, this issue is quite common in many users that approach their 3-4th year of using facebook; less personal sharing, more 'contact collecting'.<p>I wonder if what everyone thinks of a service that helps clean up the social media, or even more broadly, online presence of individuals.  www.123people.co.uk tells you webpages/ social media accounts/ pictures/ articles about a person just by typing in first, last name and a region.<p>With facebook recently opening up email addresses for companies to target their ads (<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/facebook-crm-ads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/facebook-crm-ads/</a>).

This may be a case where someone should have been fired after weeks, not years. In that case, she may be starting from scratch.<p>But if both parties were acting in good faith, Drinko may be a short contract away --- maybe even a pure ""skinning"" HTML+CSS UI project away --- from a demo that will generate customer interest, help her get more funding, and attract a better quality of developer.",1210186735

They could use FireDrop’s tech to add better visualizations for information contained within the e-mail, which has been their core focus so far.<p>If they instead start offering functionality that only works between contacts who both have Xobni, then we’re seeing a big shift in their business strategy; it suddenly provides an incentive (other than, “hey, this is awesome”) for users to encourage their coworkers and friends to add Xobni.

Something legal might be necessary.  If she is willing to sign a non-compete, and finish the project that is what you want, else, options 2 and 3 are on the table.<p>Next you need to finish your project.  <a href=""http://uservoice.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uservoice.com/</a> provides an outsourced software feedback engine for a website.  If your feedback engine is more specific to your business process then you need still need to hire a developer.<p>At this point in the process, if you need to find a technical co-founder, i would skip it and go right for a freelance developer.  You have developed most of the idea, and now you just need to round the corners,  this is a perfect job for someone that just wants a pay check.   I suggest 2 options to finding a developer.<p>Option 1, go your local colleges TODAY! and talk to career services.  You might be able to find a programmer that can pick up fairly quickly what your previous developer did.  You might be able to get away with $10-$20 an hour.<p>Option 2,  i have heard of good things from <a href=""http://programmermeetdesigner.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmermeetdesigner.com/</a>, or another place to pay someone for a project.<p>Ok, so the final thing you need to do is to raise more money.  Either sell the app now on a trial basis or something.  You might be able to get some cash in the door to help with legal fees, and to pay your new designer.  You might find it easier to see if you can get another $50k right now from an Angel, Prosper.com, or from a potential customer that might loan you the money.<p>I hope that helps.

183690,comment,183535,183535,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Now is the time to be honest with yourself. You need to find out why she left. People usually complain about money/equity issues when they think the situation is so crappy that only money/equity can keep them in the situation. Was there a lot of scope creep?<p>Let me pose this hypothetical situation. You contract with this developer to create your web app before you have fully spec'd it out. But that's okay because you're using more of an agile approach. The developer gets on with her job of creating a basic prototype and you tackle issues as they arise. Things begin to change and you see want a few minor changes to the web app. The developer not being very assertive, says okay to most change requests. But 6 months in things have changed so much that the developer realizes that this project will be in perpetual beta. You are frustrated because the developer hasn't finished when she said she would. She's frustrated because she realizes just how extensive the web app is and that she underestimated the amount of work that would be involved (and with the feature creep there is even more work now to boot). Both of you are so far away from the original terms of the agreement that the whole thing leaves a sour taste in your mouth. She can walk. But you're left with the tab.<p>If this sounds like your situation, I know it won't make you feel any better, but it's a common story. I think what you need to do is offer the developer a way to save face while helping get you out of your current rut. Chances are she's not very proud of having bailed on the project, nor does she want bad word of mouth to spread. She was probably frustrated. Can you identify her frustrations and address them? If so, can you talk her into re-joining the team and giving her the 35% equity? Right now, you have 94% of a whole lot of nothing. If she doesn't want to re-join fully, ask her if she will help document the project and transition it to another developer for you. If she does this, you will give her the existing 6% equity in the company. If she flat out refuses to talk to you, keep your composure and be polite but let her know that under the circumstances you feel her monthly payments were more than acceptable compensation and she has no equity. If this happens, your money is gone and isn't worth pursuing. But I would contact a lawyer in order to sort out this non-documented partnership. You will want her to sign something because right now there are a whole bunch of ugly intellectual property ownership issues that you are at risk of down the road.",1210185689

I guess in that sense I'm doing things backwards. I hope to be active now that I'm not spending all my free time writing and am polishing up an acts_as_rdf plugin for ActiveRecord that I hope will help the semantic web-minded folks.<p>- I had co-authored another book for Wrox before, so had been emailing back and forth with them afterwards about how important Rails was. That email thread turned into a book proposal.<p>I can only speak for my own book writing experience with Wiley/Wrox, but it is likely similar across the tech industry. You don't have to write the book up front or get an agent. Instead you submit a proposal to the publisher that is essentially your pitch: it includes a potential table of contents, your own market analysis, and why you think the book is a necessary addition to the existing set of published knowledge.<p>If all goes well, the proposal turns into a contract, which is basically a 15 page way of saying that you split the copyright, get a royalty advance, and get X% of sales, where X seems to be around 10% for the big publishers. (Pragmatic gives 50%!!).<p>Then you start the writing process, which took about a year both times for me, divided into ~8 months of writing, ~2 months of editing, and ~1.5 month of last-minute bug fixing and waiting for the book to print.<p>All in all, it's been simultaneously the hardest and most rewarding thing I've done in my (admittedly short) professional life.

I hope this isn't a cheesy thing to say, but I really tried to make this the book I wish that I had to guide me after I had been experimenting with Rails for a while.<p>This book is different for a few important reasons:<p>First off, it speaks to issues of design rather than issues of API. That has important ramifications in the way the material is covered. Agile Web Development with Rails (Pragmatic) and The Rails Way (Addison) are two fantastic books, and both are on the shelf next to my desk right now, but they both concentrate on exhaustive coverage of the Rails API. The Art of Rails is meant to be the kind of book you buy after owning one of those. It takes someone familiar with the /syntax/ of coding Rails and attempts to provide guidance and insight into the /style/ and design patterns of architecting an entire application with Rails.<p>Second, it devotes three whole chapters (8, 9, and 10) to developing with the ""Ruby style"". So many web developers learn Ruby because of Rails that they eventually get to a point in their Rails development skills where they stand to really benefit by taking a few steps outside of Rails to learn how Ruby is a fundamentally different language than {PHP, Java, other OO/Procedural languages}. The Art of Rails really devotes a significant effort to talking about the new and Ruby-centric design patterns that constructs like blocks, Procs, method_missing, and instance_eval make possible, and then it provides examples of how you can use these design patterns in your Rails applications.<p>Third, it backs up design patterns with useful, concise examples that you can actually execute, but otherwise stays clear from drowning you with example code that is better left to online format.<p>Finally, I wrote it to read cover-to-cover, or at least a chapter at a time, whereas a lot of tech books these days are really centered around dictionary-style reference lookup. This book should be fun to read, have you nodding your head, and leave you with some useful abstractions, coding techniques, and new tricks when you're done.<p>I'll stop here to prevent myself from leaving a run-on comment, but thanks for pushing back for more justification of the book",1210183575

You read about beers with high ratings and beers with low ratings. Ratings are stupid! There are plenty of very highly rated beers that I can't stand, and plenty of poorly rated beers that I really love. There are exotic, rare, extremely expensive beers that can do no wrong, and there are typical, everyday offerings that many scoff at.<p>Long story short, I stopped looking at ratings. I make my own decisions about what I want to drink. I know what I like better than any other person.

A thick, heavy stout that rivals the alcohol content of most wines is a terrible thing in the blistering heat. I also can't drink several extremely hoppy beers with  food.

There are plenty of highly regarded beers I can't see being enjoyed with my favorite foods.

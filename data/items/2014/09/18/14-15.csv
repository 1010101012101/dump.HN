I notice you&#x27;ve posted it many times in this thread, so maybe you got confused.<p>By the way, the director of the NIMH isn&#x27;t the &quot;highest-ranking psychiatrist&quot;. That title doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>>Ah. Now I see the problem. Scientific questions are never resolved by voting -- not ever. They are all resolved by empirical evidence. For questions that cannot be resolved by evidence, scientists adopt the null hypothesis, the precept that an idea is false until it is supported by evidence.<p>This is not true.<p>In most fields, including general medicine, there is no governing licensing body similar to the APA. This is because psychiatry is the only medical discipline that postdates the concept of regulatory bodies.<p>In general medicine, it&#x27;s very common for two doctors to treat the same illness differently. This is why cancer patients can choose between radiology and surgery and chemotherapy.<p>Now, the APA could abandon the concept of regulation and allow any licensed psychiatrist to treat anything in any way, but as a society we&#x27;ve democratically (by vote) decided that psychiatry should be regulated, so its regulatory body decides the treatments that can and cannot be administered, and what constitutes something worth treating. (If you want to go outside this structure, you just can&#x27;t call the person you&#x27;re getting treatment from a psychiatrist. Priests, consolers, social workers, etc., are examples of alternatives.)<p>So, the world does not work the way you think it does. This is because you&#x27;re espousing a philosophy of science called Positivism or Verificationism: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism</a><p>This school of thought was abandoned in the early 1900s. Currently, the dominant philosophy of science is Falsificationism: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Falsificationism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Falsificationis...</a><p>...which holds that ideas compete via aggregate evidence judged by each individual scientist, gaining ground via confirmatory evidence (though never being proven) and losing ground via falsifying evidence.<p>>The bottom line is that a scientist would never say, &quot;We don&#x27;t know what this is, but let&#x27;s offer clinical treatments anyway -- because the public doesn&#x27;t understand either science or our poverty of knowledge.&quot;<p>This is also not true.  Doctors offer treatments that aren&#x27;t definitively explained all the time.

Admittedly, some of it is semantics, but when you&#x27;re talking about branding, I think semantics are critical.<p>-To me, a brand is the emotional associations a customer has with a product/organization. Branding is our attempt to influence the customer into that desired emotional state. Hence, not really a relationship. (Adrian&#x27;s point about a brand not being a logo, etc., is critical and something many people don&#x27;t understand.)<p>-I hesitate to call a brand a relationship, because that&#x27;s not how a customer thinks, or ever will think. It&#x27;s our job to build that emotional association. Also, ultimately, the customer gets to decide what the brand is (if we drop the ball).<p>-To your point that started this thread, traditional branding processes don&#x27;t work for lean orgs. Take too much time, too much money, don&#x27;t provide any strategy or flexibility when encountering change (!), contain too many rules, limit your teams&#x27; ability to creatively solve problems in real-time.

But the simple way to look at brand is it&#x27;s the mix of identity(logo) and story(content). Your #1 job is to make the story clear and actively promote it. Over time you&#x27;ll be able to train your audience to use this story to share with their network.<p>From a Lean POV(not sure that this aligns 100%) I have a couple notes for you on the structures I&#x27;ve used with previous clients. It&#x27;s the simple path of hypothesis, test, iterate, optimize.<p>The end goal here is to gather real &quot;data&quot; in the form of your users&#x27;/target audience&#x27;s own words to help clearly define a core brand story/positioning statement they can internalize and share with their networks.<p>Hypothesis: Company X is a (what/label) that (why/benefits) by (how/features).<p>I use this as a general guide to get the core keywords of the brand story.<p>Audience Testing: the goal is to test the hypothesis and answer two basic questions. 1) Is this compelling? Do people give a shit about this and would they buy it? 2) Is this clear? Do they quickly understand the statement and internalize it? Or do they have follow-up questions?<p>Data Sources: This is the footwork. Gather feedback on that statement to from random samples of your target demo on the street. Ask them to repeat it back? What words do they use? Do email surveys to your network and contacts, always include an opt-in at the end to note if they&#x27;re okay with a follow-up call for more direct input. Phone calls/interviews, some paid FB ad testing. I say FB b/c it&#x27;s generally been cheaper and quicker for feedback for me than AdWords.<p>Note: I try to record as much of this as possible, and have a partner to take notes if I&#x27;m on a call or interview. The unfiltered verbatim comments are what to use in your revisions.<p>Iterate: based on the data gathered, make revisions to the core statement and retest. I typically go 3-4 rounds before getting solid on something. Expect about 30-60 days to execute depending on your resources.<p>Core Brand Statement: once you&#x27;ve tested and finalized, you&#x27;ll have a compelling and clear brand statement that effectively uses your audience&#x27;s own words. It&#x27;s time to actively work this into the balance of your marketing across your site content and other channels.<p>Don&#x27;t just sit back now. Actively tell that story. Use it to share al your marketing, PR, brand-aligned partnerships, etc. And keep testing. New data sources will be A/B LP testing, content metrics, social engagement metrics, etc.<p>If you&#x27;ve got other questions, I&#x27;m happy to chat. Email is in my profile.",1411051135

8335357,comment,8328589,8332674,1,0,kgbdrop,,,"> But more importantly, while the &quot;frozen at the Pleistocene&quot; approach is false - and already known to be false, no serious scientist believes that literally nothing changed since - it is also true to large extent. The Pleistocene is a huge amount of time, and in the short amount of time following it humanity diverged quite a bit - yet, we find humans extremely similar, mentally. From aboriginal Australians to Africans to Europeans to native Americans, mentally humanity is extremely close. That is very strong support that while clearly evolution continued after the Pleistocene, major things were already set by then.<p>While this is undoubtably true, this is one aspect of the criticisms of EP where I can understand where they are coming from. This is due to the history of EP. I do capitalize EP to distinguish the strain of psychological thinking and research primarily flowing from a relatively small group of researchers who owe much of their intellectual heritage to researchers at UC Santa Barbara from the generic view of placing psychological findings into an evolutionary perspective.<p>The critics were right that EP is _basically_ rebranded sociobiology. Now sociobiology flamed out very quickly due to the backlash that EO Wilson received after the publication of his book Sociobiology in the mid 1970s. No only had adaptationist perspectives in biology not entirely taken hold, there were numerous academic disciplines almost fundamentally opposed to the idea that culture (and humanity) was not entirely arbitrary. Hell, in 1983 after Derek Freeman published his debunking of Margaret Mead&#x27;s claims about the Samoan people, the American Anthropological Association passed a motion declaring his work unscientific and _irresponsible_.<p>This milieu where EP formed was absolutely toxic to any claims about a (universal) biological influence on behavior and held nearly to an axiom that talk of genetic variation which influences behavior was inherently racist, sexist, etc. Take the controversy over the Bell Curve, published in 1994. The entire book, save one chapter, dealt with claimed genetic factors which influence behavior that broke down by class or socioeconomic status. A lone chapter dealt with race. Yet the initial controversy and the book&#x27;s legacy is that of being racist. Nevermind the fair more numerous claims about the role genetics played in arranging people into social and economic classes. The mere mention of biological variation influencing behavior was a tactical move that virtually no scientist would touch.<p>With this backdrop, EP was developed. Honestly, marginal scientists trudging away in the relative backwoods of academia began to synthesize a perspective on human nature that took our biological past seriously. The obvious route, and probably the most common route, focused on human universals. Anyone with a basic understanding of biology will understand the general thesis of this strain of EP. All humans everywhere dealt with a shared set of problems: (1) finding food and shelter to survive (classic selection) and (2) finding a mate so that you can pass you genes to the next generation (sexual selection). There are derivative issues which arise from our shared experience like being able to cooperate with non-kin to form basic societies or being able to detect cheaters in all realms where there is a risk of someone being a free rider.<p>Taking these basic claims about shared human experience, you can begin to apply them in slowly expanding circles to many facets of human behavior and psychology. But the core will always be about human universals. There will always be variation, but they are variations on universals. This is precisely why many who are unversed in the actual work of EP have the instinctual worry about EP focusing too much on the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene is a safe refuge for a perspective that develops in a hostile intellectual climate. It is also tactically a wise strategy. Focus on universals to gain credibility like say with David Buss&#x27;s 1989 paper &quot;Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures&quot;. Go broad or become smeared.<p>As you say, there is unlikely any researcher in EP who gives any sort of credence to the notion that our psychology was &#x27;frozen in the Pleistocene&#x27;, but especially historically, there was little place else to go. Beyond that, there are mounds of fascinating findings which only need to focus on how much our psychology has _not_ adapted that it has kept researchers busy for quite some time.<p>That intellectual heritage along with the fact that the gold standard in EP (legitimate cross cultural work) is extraordinarily hard and expensive combined with our infantile understanding of genetics makes doing serious work in understanding the ways that post-Pleistocene environments have shaped our psychology very, very difficult indeed.",1411050503

Page sync was the most useful feature for me because I kept my Kindle in my home and read on the go with a phone.<p>The main pain point for me was the lack of Epub support in it. I wanted to buy the paperwhite but in an effort to not support DRM based solutions I started buying my technical books directly on the publishers website with non-DRM formats.<p>Then Kobo released the Kobo mini and that was the perfect pocketable size for me. I jumped in. All my Kindle notions and impressions were out of the door. The Kobo was a much better device in my opinion. The &quot;Reading Life&quot; feature was awesome and the UX and font selection great. Stopped using the Kindle.<p>Then I missed a light. I tend to read on the dark hours and something like the paperwhite became a need. eReaders are not cheap here in Brazil. A Kindle Paperwhite with cost you USD 200+. Since I was a fan of Kobo, I decided to check out the Kobo Aura HD. Heck the thing was the price of a laptop.<p>In the end a major book retailer here in Brazil decided to ship their own eReader called Lev. It had a version with light, it could read Epubs and other formats and it fit my budget. Also it had a killer feature the both Kindle and Kobo lacked: PDF Reflow. This small simple eReader can reflow text on a PDF to fit the screen and it works pretty well. I was sold. I am pretty happy with my Lev eReader now, I have all the features I could want from the competitors plus the ability to read old LISP book PDFs as if they were meant for that screen.<p>Moral of the story: Instead of jumping in and buying the new thing from gigantic retailer, shop around and see what the small guys are doing in your region. There might be an eReader there that fits your needs much better than the Kindle. (Still miss page sync though)",1411050291

8335268,comment,8332614,8334966,1,0,TheCraiggers,,,"Basically, what I&#x27;m hearing when reading both yours and the OP&#x27;s comments is the old problem of &quot;ignorance vs. happiness&quot;. Is it better to be ignorant and happy, or knowledgeable and unhappy? The premise, of course, being that the more you know, the more you know how fucked up everything is and the less happy you are.<p>(I&#x27;m not sure where that trope started. I&#x27;d be interested to know if any historians can point to a period of time where this took off, or was first mentioned in philosophy.)<p>Going back to OP&#x27;s comment, that seemed to be the main difference: in Trek, for example, we have a civilization which had a lot of knowledge. Both at an individual level (everyone portrayed (with possible exception of Barclay...) was very intelligent) and at a civilization level. However, they somehow manged this while staying happy. Maybe this is because they solved all the problems, but I think it had more to do with the writers choosing to portray the stories in that light. It seemed the federation was not above its political squabbles, after all, and there were times that ship captains ignored direct orders on moral grounds. So it&#x27;s not like everything was perfect.<p>Meanwhile, taking a look at a cyberpunk story, you seem to find a setting in which we learned many things, and the more we learned the less happy we became. The decker that hacks into a corporation and discovers just how horrible of an entity they truly are, is an example at an individual level. One could also point to the general state of the world in those stories, and consider how knowledge &quot;corrupted&quot; us.<p>Looking at your mother&#x27;s story, I&#x27;m guessing this is a similar situation. The more you know about what&#x27;s going on around you, you more you notice the gilded veneer over everything. Those who didn&#x27;t realize the propaganda were all lies and exaggerations were probably happier (and of course worked harder).",1411049364

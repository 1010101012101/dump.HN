5519835,comment,5518881,5519266,1,0,roland37,,,"I think you're overestimating what applicants are expecting here.  Obviously a form rejection opens up a lot of problems, but a form acknowledgement doesn't share those issues.  Something as simple as ""Thank you for your resume, we will review it and contact you if it appears that we may have a position suitable for you.""  Stress on the ""will review"" so that it's clear the applicant hasn't been considered yet, favorably or otherwise.<p>In particular, I consider this worthwhile for resumes submitted at various career fairs.  The process employed there frequently comes down to handing over a paper resume and being told ""Thank you for your resume, we'll digitize it and put it into our system.""  This is far from reassuring, particularly after the first few times you get clear proof that your resume was never digitized at all.  A form note simply acknowledging the submission provides your applicants with confidence that their resume is truly in your possession and a better feeling than applying to a black hole.",1365530381

You can do that by clicking a confirmation link we send you. Or, as of Beta2 (today!), you can do that by having your domain implement the Persona Identity Provider API, where your domain publishes a public-key and issues certificates to you based on that public key, which you can then use to sign into web sites. Also as of today, we do that for Yahoo users by bridging to Yahoo OpenID, so basically Persona is an OpenID client to Yahoo, gets Yahoo to vouch for your email, and based on that issues you a Persona certificate (backed by our public key) for your email address.<p>But whatever way you go, it's about proving you own an email address and obtaining a certificate for it.<p>Yes, someone who has access to your browser can fake your identity if you don't lock your browser/OS, but that's nothing new.

Nobody makes billions as a line engineer (but nobody makes billions as a line ""manager"" either). But in my experience once you get a degree in engineering, that totally shapes your world view and how you approach problems even if you go on and do other things. So I think those people should count too.<p>Using a relatively narrow definition, out of the Forbes 25 you might count Charles and David Koch (BS/MS in ChemE/MechE), Jeff Bezos (BS EECS), Larry Page and Sergey Brin (BS CS), and Mukesh Ambani (BS ChemE). These guys all made their fortune at companies related to their engineering discipline. Broadening the definition, you can also throw in there Larry Ellison (no degree, but worked at Amdahl and Ampex as a programmer on databases), and Bill Gates. Finally, you could throw in Michael Bloomberg (BS EE--went straight into finance) and Bernard Arnault (BS CivE, worked as a civil engineer but made his fortune elsewhere).<p>That's disproportionate, considering that only 1-3% of the population is engineers.",1365529849

The WSJ report noted that Apple was concerned that "" AppGratis was pushing a business model that appeared to favor developers with the financial means to pay for exposure.""\nSimon hasn't addressed this point. Do they make paid recommendations ?<p>If they do make app-recommendations based on payments, it makes a lot of sense for Apple to ban them. As an iOS (and Android) developer, I personally think that paid-recommendations are bad for the ecosystem (though I'm sure that some giant shops paying for recommendations may disagree). At the least, I think users of AppGratis should be told if the recommendations are ""paid for"".<p>2. Simon's discussion of rule 5.6 doesn't really address the problem. Rule 5.6 says ""Apps cannot use Push Notifications to send advertising, promotions, or direct marketing of any kind.""<p>Simon counters by saying that they only send one notification per day and that users opt-in. However, neither claim refutes the fact that they''re violating rule 5.6. All iOS push-notifications are opt-in anyway. Rule 5.6 says 'no advertisement , no promotions,.... no direct marketing'. It doesn't make exceptions for apps that only send one notification per day. Now Simon could argue that Rule 5.6 is bad for the user and that push-notification-advertisements/promotions are good. That may be a debatable point. However, it is clear that his claims do nothing to counter the fact that AppGratis violates Rule 5.6 (as it is written)",1365529556

Possibly with a viewer on gh-pages or on the /:username/:reponame/commits/:branchname endpoint?<p>* DXF sucks, but yeah DXF rendering.<p>* Maybe consider thingiview.js (which does not use WebGL) or possibly a WebGL equivalent viewer. Controlled rotation, zooming, camera repositioning, etc. It seems that most of these features are implemented:<p><a href=""https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/blob/master/mini/z-bottom-left.stl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/blob/master/mini/z-bott...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/blob/master/mini/y-motor.stl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/blob/master/mini/y-moto...</a><p>* openscad rendering- I know this is a pain in the butt, especially since openscad still requires xserver. But at least it feels more like source code. There are some other options other than openscad that could be easier to render without an xserver, which would be fine in my book, I am not particularly attached to openscad.<p>* Other scripting/rendering options... maybe implicitcad, pythonocc (opencascade/python bindings), HeeksCAD/python, FreeCAD/python, OpenJSCAD, something like that. The problem with STL is that it's like transmitting compiled binaries to other developers, but what developers really want to work with is the source code. Having to commit STL is like having to commit compiled binaries.<p>* UI widgets for committing from SolidWorks, Pro/Engineer, CATIA, AutoCAD, HeeksCAD, FreeCAD, and other front-ends would be really useful. I would be happy to use github.com while working on my next fighter jet project.<p>* Upverter claims to support git, but really it's just a link to a remote git repository and you can't push your schematics to Upverter. Please feel free to eat their lying lunches. Maybe also circuitlab's (although they have never claimed to have git integration). So yeah, schematics.<p>* Some projects require thousands of parts that need to be included when rendering, especially in assemblies. It would be nice to be able to see a fully rendered image of a version of the repository contents. This quickly devolves into a mess of file format hell, which I imagine is not something you want to tackle. But maybe this could be done through continuous integration hooks or something?<p>For whatever it's worth, here's a terrible post-receive bash script I wrote in 2010 for scad rendering on a git server:<p><a href=""http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/gitduino-post-receive.sh.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/gitduino-post-receive.sh.txt</a><p>* It would be exceedingly awesome if you could get the RepRap project to jump ship from svn to git. RepRap is the largest, most well organized open source hardware project, and I think it would be a great community to work with to show how strong git is for distributed hardware development.<p>There are already some really excellent RepRap projects in git repositories on github:<p><a href=""https://github.com/josefprusa/PrusaMendel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/josefprusa/PrusaMendel</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/tree/master/mini"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/tree/master/mini</a>",1365529016

(I've yet to find a satisfying response to this).<p>Several problems come to mind:<p>* There's not enough computation. With BTC-type currencies, the value of the money is far higher than the cost of the backing computation (look up bitcoin mining calculations). If you have a computational commodity currency, they should be closely linked (by definition!). And a home PC can support a trivial amount of computation ($100's at most) -- not enough to be useful.<p>* Not enough demand for (pure, parallelizable) computation.<p>* No intrinsic way to ""store"" computation. You can record the existence of computation, but if this done by a distributed P2P system like bitcoin, the commodity-backing property is lost. A file verifying that a computation was performed is not itself computation: it doesn't solve any problems, it has no intrinsic value. Of course a <i>legal</i> private currency, backed by banks and courts, could keep track of such debts and make them enforceable.<p>* Security problem: you would need to run arbitrary machine code on a home PC, if this were to have any useful value. This is dangerous and unsolved. Is there any way to run, e.g., untrusted CUDA code in a sandbox? (I believe no)<p>* Accounting. There's no pure ""unit"" of computation: you would have many types of computational problems, being assigned to many different types of hardware. In the real world, I think you wouldn't end up with a single currency so much as a market, with many currencies and many fluctuating exchange rates. If you could extract a currency from this, it would be as a currency basket (5% protein folding, 5% linear algebra...)<p>So I suspect this wouldn't work well <i>today</i>.

Generalists, while less technically adept at any one task as experts (I was thinking of using the term specialist there), many times have more experience with communication, managing changes, and, hum, diplomacy.<p>Again, from the outside, Google looks like a regiment of special forces: each member individually highly competent, and together, when deployed appropriately, quite capable.

People who have problems, find clever solutions to them.  This becomes the foundation of long-term growth in innovations.<p>Secondly, you are massively underestimating Asian innovation.  Almost all global manufacturing of key technologies, such as RAM, has almost entirely moved to Asia.  Moore's Law has not slowed for those technology.  There is lots of innovation going on in those fields, and it is all Asian at this point.  Mostly covered by trade secrets rather than US patents, but it is still real and your computer wouldn't run without it.<p>Did you hear that Samsung recently got criticized for deciding to budget more on marketing than R&D?  They did.  When was the last time that you saw a US company criticized for valuing marketing above R&D?  What does that say about the innovation culture in South Korea vs the USA?  (Yes, innovation in China and India are behind South Korea - but 20 years ago nobody thought of South Korea as more than a bunch of copycats.  How will they remember their history in 200 years?)<p>Thirdly you're not acknowledging the fact that the USA historically had a deserved reputation for not respecting intellectual property.  For example Charles Dickens had more than a few choice words about how freely his works were pirated verbatim in the USA.  Key technologies were taken lock, stock and barrel without compensation - exactly what Americans today complain about Asian countries doing.<p>In short there are good parallels between how the USA behaved and was seen 200 years ago, and what's going on today in Asia.",1365528497

Going from a paper memo to email exacerbates this I think. Best case scenario, you can present very clear and well structured information but if you go past two pages you have to wonder if anyone is really paying that much attention. As a ""best case example"" I'd look at something like this memo that Robert McNamara wrote to LBJ about a month after LBJ took office: <a href=""https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon3/doc156.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon3/doc156.htm</a> .

The focus is entirely on the USD/BTC exchange rate, but is that really the proper measure of value to use when discussing inflation or deflation? I'm not an economist by any means, so I honestly don't know, but that seems a little wrong somehow.<p>In particular, when we say the USD is worth 10% of what it was 60 years ago, we're not comparing that to any other currency. We're just saying that things that were $1 USD back in the day tend to be $10 USD now. Then when we talk about BTC being deflationary, we talk about 1 BTC a year ago being traded for $200 USD now (or whatever it is). It seems a bit apples to oranges to me.<p>So here's a question: when BTC value in terms of USD spikes, does the price of goods in BTC spike proportionally? If so, maybe that's a reasonable metric of value for now. I haven't bought in to BTC yet, so I don't actually know the answer. But in all these discussions about inflation or deflation and instability in a hypothetical BTC economy, does it really make sense to still talk about the USD/BTC rate?",1365528017

And yes for the most part, it is. The reality is he's a busy man, with a busy life, anyone who thinks that his family life is somehow supposed to be like that of a traditional ""as seen in social studies"" textbook either has their head up their you know what or is trying to mask a certain insecurity with a veneer of self-righteousness.<p>>What could be more important than a happy family and personal life? How on earth is this considered ""hype""?<p>That may be all well and good for you, but first, you have a terribly ethnocentric and rather simplistic view of life as seen only from your perspective. Some people want to get enough and retire and frolic. Other people want to discover. Your ideal life may be sitting on the porch waiting for little Timmy to get back from school so you can build a go-kart; that's great, but that's not everyone's ideal life - and it doesn't in any way mean that little Timmy is any less important to anyone else. So if your thesis is that your vision of life is somehow better simply because it's the most traditional, you're going to need a more robust argument for that.<p>>I would trade any amount of billions for that, in fact I probably have, because I decided long ago that family and my personal happiness are more important than millions in the bank.<p>Also, you make the assumption that the man is somehow concerned about money. Whether you do that on purpose to further your point, or whether you didn't take full stock of the situation, I don't know. But the man is rich. And if he wasn't rich before, he's certainly ""fuck you"" rich now. He could be earning multiples on his money without even lifting a finger. It's not about money, it's about interest, and apparently, for him, about vision. My comment was about people self-righteously trying to compare the amount of time and the way they spend time with their families to someone who - regardless of how you feel about him, and I don't feel as hot as everyone else about him - is taking on two immensely difficult tasks. So when John Battelle, and everyone else self-righteously comment about not using email when spending time with their kids as if they were some martyrs of child-rearing, I'd have to say there's some insecurity involved.<p>So it's great that you wouldn't trade money over your children. That's great and I'm sure no well-adjusted person would. However, there are things in life that do not fit in to the inane work-life paradigm, and people expecting it to, either have very limited scopes of what life is and how one should live it, or they have their eyes glossed over by nicely packaged institutions of socialization. The truth is, a lot of people have very complex family lives. It's nice when you look at social studies textbooks and see two parents, one son, and one daughter, but life's never been like that and a happy family can't simplistically be reduced to ""one that doesn't check email and text while spending time with each other - which, by the way, must be x amount of hours if you really want to be considered a close, happy family""",1365527211

5519440,comment,5518480,5519285,2,0,nxn,,,"I actually implemented a very primitive word wrap function specifically for wrapping text in SVGs about two weeks ago. I took the approach of keeping an single canvas object in memory (completely detached from the DOM, 1x1 pixel dimensions) and using its ""measureText"" method for calculating string lengths. This made the algorithm fairly simple, and if you set the font on the canvas context correctly, the results will actually be fairly accurate -- though you might have to take into account any scaling that you have applied on the SVG.<p>This approach did not cause any noticeable change in performance, at least not in my use case where there are at most around 100 nodes of text that needed word wrapping. I can't really compare it with other approaches since I saw no need to take multiple stabs at the problem when my first attempt proved to work well enough. I would guess that it might be faster than actually creating SVG text elements and then trying to get their widths since you're eliminating a lot of overhead in the pre-calculation phase. Also, as far as desktop browsers go, anything that has SVG also has canvas, so there were no worries there about browser compatibility issues.<p>EDIT: But yeah, I'm just mentioning this in case you find some use for it. Looking at your link I would say you're much better off just using foreignObject.",1365526955

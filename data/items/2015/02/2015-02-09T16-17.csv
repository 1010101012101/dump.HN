Technically it falls upon customs to stop these from entering, but customs is not qualified to do compatibility testing. Personally I think the correct response would be a customer protection law that requires that manufacturers and vendors take back/replace problematic products, rather than forcing pre-certification and membership in predatory organizations on everyone. The current regulatory environment (particularly WEEE) is toxic to any kind of small-scale manufacture, not because of the specific requirements imposed, but because of the gigantic costs of complying with said requirements in a regulation-approved way.",1423501139

9022164,comment,9017027,9017521,0,0,vonmoltke,,,"> Regarding your first point it&#x27;s extremely rare in my experience to have an interviewer expect perfect/compiable code when whiteboarding (nearly every whiteboarding exercise I&#x27;ve ever done has been prefaced with the interviewer explicitly stating this). They&#x27;re looking for how you go about solving a problem, they don&#x27;t care about missing semicolons.<p>The interview instructions Amazon gave me prior to my in-person interviews specifically said my whiteboard code would be judged on syntax and that I was expected to produce working code, not pseudocode.  They are not the only company that has said this to me, so I do not think it is &quot;extremely rare&quot;.<p>> As for your second point, just because the ability to easily &quot;inspect the actual work done&quot; is not practical in one profession doesn&#x27;t mean it shouldn&#x27;t be considered in a completely different profession where it is practical.<p>For a large portion of programmers, it <i>is</i> impractical.

9022141,comment,9020165,9021760,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"[Disclaimer: this is a rough idea, not a tax code.  Almost certainly needs further thought to make sure there aren&#x27;t any unwanted incentives for strange behavior.]<p>> 1/ Shareholder and CEO. My company generates €1M in profit. I pay myself a salary of €1M, and pay a flat tax on my salary. The business pays no tax.<p>Right.<p>> 2/ CEO, but no shareholder. The company generates €1M in profit, and pays flat tax on that €1M. Dividends flow to shareholders, and they&#x27;re taxed again?<p>Dividends don&#x27;t magically appear out of nowhere; they&#x27;re paid out of profits, just like a salary.  (Some companies pay out the majority of their profits as dividends, others pay none at all.)  They&#x27;d either get taxed at the business because they&#x27;re not paid out, or taxed at the shareholders because they are, not both.<p>As much as I&#x27;d hate to point at it as an example of anything, think VAT, with its notion of &quot;where was the value added&quot;, but on the income side, as &quot;where was the profit extracted&quot;.  Either a VAT-style sales tax (with less doublespeak) or a flat profit tax seems like a workable model.  And much like VAT&#x27;s presumption of paying sales tax unless you show that you bought something taxed, the presumption is that you&#x27;re paying tax on every dollar of income/revenue, unless you provide evidence in the form of having paid that dollar to someone else who then paid tax on it (or who provided evidence that they paid it to ...).<p>Interestingly, that then means that if you take money <i>out</i> of the country and out of the economy, you get to pay all the taxes on it at that point.  That seems like a nice side effect.<p>The structure ends up looking a lot like VAT, with a key difference: it affects <i>all</i> transactions, without requiring any kind of code defining taxable/non-taxable items.  But apart from that, I think your questions just demonstrated that a profit tax effectively turns into VAT.<p>Half of the tax code for a flat tax on profits would probably end up being absurdly precise definitions of what &quot;profit&quot; means.  (Then again, the other half, or the whole tax code for a flat tax on income, would probably end up being absurdly precise definitions for what &quot;income&quot; means.)<p>(To preempt the obvious response: yes, there are companies, such as the one-off shell companies constructed to make films, that intentionally construct their books such that they don&#x27;t actually make any profit.  However, that money has to go <i>somewhere</i>, and it&#x27;ll get taxed there.)<p>That said, it wouldn&#x27;t be the end of the world to just make it a flat (and much lower) tax on income rather than on profits.  That&#x27;d be a much simpler system; it would, however, be much more of a drag force on the economy, like the current tax system.  Hard tradeoff.<p>> 3/ What do you do with foreign companies that levy corporate tax, and then declare a dividend? Do you tax it again at the flat tax in the hands of the shareholder?<p>[I&#x27;m assuming you mean &quot;foreign companies in a jurisdiction that levies corporate tax&quot;?]<p>The situation definitely gets more difficult with a non-self-contained economy and multiple tax structures.  It&#x27;s a flat tax, so it shouldn&#x27;t have a complex set of deductions and loopholes, especially that only apply to large multinational businesses.  So yeah, I think you&#x27;d have to just ignore the foreign corporate tax, and treat the money paid as a dividend as income entering the economy.",1423500772

However, it&#x27;s worth noting that many distributions ship Chromium instead of Chrome by default, as it is proprietary software. It is still not possible to watch Netflix on Firefox, as they have not yet implemented EME (HTML5&#x27;s DRM).

The Apollo program alone was something like $150b fixed for inflation.<p>The Buran looks like more central planning failures from an incompetent regime on its way out. Please stop making excuses for Soviet leadership. They clearly dropped the ball after a few early successes in the space race. By the 70s the Soviet program was in tatters and a joke and by the 80s the Shuttle did incredible things that the capsule based approach simple couldn&#x27;t do (repairing hubble, etc).  Obviously, the cost estimates of the shuttle were lower than real cost, but I can&#x27;t think of any major project where that wasn&#x27;t true. Now that we are motivated to do more than LEO, the Shuttle was retired for a capsule based approach that is a private and public partnership between NASA and companies like SpaceX who are showing us how cheap rockets can be.<p>Its unfair to compare failed test projects, which were also fairly uninspired copies, like the Buran and the N1 to workhorses like the Saturn V and the Shuttle. The Russiophilia around here is pretty high and unfairly so. The Russians deserve credit for their early successes but they were not able to keep them up and oddball projects like mounting 50 cal guns on space stations or launching (and failing thankfully) space based weapons platforms (Polyus) should lead to their criticism, as well as their uninspired 70s and 80s failures and pathetic attempts at cloning western successes like the Concorde or the Shuttle.<p>I&#x27;d rather live in a world where the Shuttle, Apollo missions, robotic missions, and Hubble were real and did amazing things, as opposed to being told by some single-party government stooge that its &quot;too expensive&quot; and cancelled. Thankfully I do live in that world and we have the space science and achievements to prove it.  What a wonderful program NASA has been. Its a shame it gets hand wringing and criticism from geeks while the largely dysfunctional later-day Soviet program gets all accolades and excuses.",1423498911

9021898,comment,9019580,9021257,0,0,nkrumm,,,"The underlying causes of autism are still not well understood, and are likely multifactorial and complex. Autism is fundamentally a disruption of the brain&#x27;s neurological processes. This can occur within the neurons themselves, at the neural synapses (connections between neurons), or at a more structural/neural organizational level. As has been pointed out elsewhere, the diversity of autism is very great and this is certainly recapitulated at even the most basic neurobiological levels. Despite the high prevalence of autism, the complexity and diversity of the disorder has made it hard to study autism in labs, in epidemiological settings, and in treatment settings.<p>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s possible to break out the causes of autism into two main groups:<p>1. Genetics. Based on large twin studies and family studies, it is believe that the underlying between 50 and 80% of autism cases are due to a genetic mutation, set of genetic mutations or otherwise influenced by genetics. The advance of sequencing technology in the past five years has made possible to sequence the genes in the human genome across thousands individuals with autism and their families. This has given rise to the idea that &quot;de novo&quot; mutations, new mutations which arise in the child, are a primary cause of autism. Every newborn has a set of new mutations, which are mostly benign or inconsequential. However, a small fraction of new mutations are detrimental to the production of key molecules or proteins needed by neurons to function properly. Researchers have identified that perhaps 20-30% of cases of autism have a new mutation which could plausibly underly autism. However, these mutations are incredible diverse-- the same de novo mutation is seen more than once only very rarely, and the top 5-10 most commonly mutated genes account for only ~1% of autism. The long tail makes it necessary to sequence tens of thousands of individuals to pick up signal. A second set.<p>2. Environment. It&#x27;s thought (but poorly understood) that certain environmental factors, especially during pregnancy, could also underly autism. Alcohol, for example, can cause Fetal Alcohol Syndrome which can present with autism-like features. Unfortunately, this half of the equation is not my subject expertise so I&#x27;ll leave it at that.<p>As a note about searching for information: While google can be unreliable, Google Scholar (<a href=""https://scholar.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.google.com/</a>) can be quite helpful.<p>Some additional resources:<p>[1] A review on the de novo genetic hypothesis for ASD that I wrote a few years back: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24387789"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24387789</a><p>[2] A large sibling/twin study from California about that heritability of autism: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21727249"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21727249</a><p>[3] A recent large-scale sequencing study for autism (sorry, paywall): <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363768"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363768</a><p>[4] A review of ASD epidemiology and etiologies: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17367287"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17367287</a><p>---

9021830,comment,9018827,9020280,0,0,jeremysalwen,,,"I think that you&#x27;re responding to an extreme interpretation of the &quot;unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think you have to believe that nature follows perfectly simple mathematical rules to be surprised to the extent that mathematics is effective at describing physical reality.<p>You make a good point, that mathematics is often designed and invented to describe reality.  You need to take into account the fact that a lot of what you &quot;get out&quot; of mathematics has already been &quot;put in&quot;.   But it is my opinion that even accounting for this, it is quite frequent that you &quot;get out&quot; more than you &quot;put in&quot; to mathematics.<p>I think a strong set of examples of this sort of behavior is when attempts to address one problem in a mathematical theory often end up addressing other seemingly unrelated problem.  The introduction of quantized energy states to explain the blackbody radiation distribution then goes on to explain the photoelectric effect. (I&#x27;m not too familiar with what physical phenomena were observed before QM but needed QM to explain them to give more examples).<p>Now you might say &quot;well of course this theory solves both issues, because they are essentially the same phenomenon, and so there&#x27;s nothing surprising about your theory explaining what it was designed to explain&quot;.  But that&#x27;s precisely the point, that mathematics gives us the tools to see relations between things that on the face of them are different.  And that there&#x27;s no reason that this /has/ to be true (without appealing to mathematics), makes the fact that it is true seem surprising.<p>Of course, being surprising, or unreasonably effective, etc is a relative statement.  Certainly to someone who expected the universe to be described mathematically to precisely the degree that it is in reality, nothing would be surprising.  But I think to most people who haven&#x27;t been introduced to mathematics (kids), the power it gives you certainly is surprising.",1423497859

To me the actual percentage is irrelevant. The relative impact is far more important.<p>So, you define a fair tax system as one whose perceived impact is identical across the tax base.<p>I define it as one where people pay in proportion to the benefits they receive.  One can, indeed, argue that a rich man receives more benefits than a poor man, since his larger fortune is protected, and indeed due to his connexions he himself is more likely to be able to call on the protection of his state.  I&#x27;d bet that it&#x27;s linear or sublinear, though, and surely not superlinear (which is the case with progressive tax systems).",1423497686

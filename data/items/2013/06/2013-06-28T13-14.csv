5957986,comment,5956926,5956926,3,0,jcromartie,,,"I think the major error in this piece is assuming that Clojure is really geared towards any one type of problem. Instead, Clojure is designed to give you a set of tools that you can freely combine for the problem at hand. It achieves this by separating concepts that are commingled in other languages, like identity, value, and type.<p>By splitting out those concepts, you get a very solid foundation on which you can build pretty much any other paradigm.",1372427992

5957982,comment,5955833,5956748,1,0,unknsldr,,,"Prior to Wikileaks and an Executive Order addressing the matter of classified information in public domain, the presence of classified information on an unclassified system almost certainly required a deliberate effort to remove the classified information. A soldier would have had to gain access to the classified system and deliberately violate regulation to extract the information. Finding the classified information on an unclassified system would otherwise have exposed gross negligence or criminal intent. This is shifting the focus from the violation that took place to transfer classified information to an unclassified system; it shifts the focus to exposure to classified information on an unclassified system.<p>Not every soldier is familiar with handling classified information. Their ignorance is bliss. They do not have access to classified systems. Now, though they have no access, they are to be treated as though they mishandled classified information because they visited a public domain website on their personal computer. They had to be told the information was classified because they otherwise could not be certain.<p>This is new enough. I do understand your position about data at rest. But I believe there is a difference based upon where the classified information was encountered and how it got there. If it is on an unclassified system, and it got there via communication with an unclassified system, I fail to see the soldier&#x27;s violation. When the soldier&#x27;s mother expressed outrage over the leak or details of the leak is the soldier supposed to report her and cease contact?<p>The block is one thing. The bit about leadership and climate is another.",1372427899

5957980,comment,5956867,5957162,2,0,masklinn,,,"> Why try and wrap it up, and pretend that you are writing Java, when you&#x27;re still writing SQL?<p>That&#x27;s not what query builders (/expression languages) do. They just express the SQL in the host language to allow for compositions and the like.<p>Because like it or not, expressing SQL as a string is a pain in the ass to compose, you can&#x27;t easily build a query incrementally.<p>With a query builder, you can. You&#x27;re still writing SQL, it&#x27;s not an object layer/ORM and it has (should have) a fairly direct mapping to SQL. You&#x27;re just writing SQL in a way which fits better in the host languages.<p>Oh, it can also provide some measure of database-independence by having database-specific backend take care to handle specific incompatibilities between databases.<p>For instance for string concatenation[0] the standard is `||` which works in SQLite, Postgres and Oracle, MSSQL uses `+` instead of `||` and in MySQL `||` is the boolean OR unless you&#x27;ve activated a specific sql mode so you&#x27;ve got no choice but to use CONCAT (you could accept a performance hit and use CONCAT everywhere, except Oracle only supports an arity of 2 and SQLite doesn&#x27;t support this function at all).<p>That&#x27;s the kind of stuff a builder can handle for you under the hood, providing much improved cross-platform compatibility.<p>[0] <a href=""http://troels.arvin.dk/db/rdbms/#functions-concat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://troels.arvin.dk/db/rdbms/#functions-concat</a>",1372427867

John Woo&#x27;s point is that the courts cannot tell the President how to treat foreigners on foreign soil during war time. The Constitution continues to apply in war time, of course, but the Constitution is silent on the subject of interrogation methods for foreign soldiers. Moreover, while torture may be in contravention of a treaty, it is not necessarily the case that the courts may supervise every executive or Congressional action for conformance with treaty obligations.<p>People like John Woo argue that the courts were not designed to be the preeminent branch. That is to say, they were not designed so they could second-guess every single action of the Congress or the Executive, even in domains like foreign policy where the Constitution conspicuously gives the President and Congress certain powers but none to the judiciary.<p>John Woo thinks it&#x27;s legal for the President to torture children (non-Americans on non-U.S. soil mind you) not because he thinks torturing children is morally justified in some way, but because he thinks that the voting public is the body that is empowered to impose consequences for such actions, not the un-elected judiciary.",1372427161

5957774,comment,5956926,5956926,15,0,jamii,,,"I didn&#x27;t find that comparison very useful/accurate (having used clojure heavily for a year or two and scala full-time for the past month). The main differences I find are:<p>When evaluating language tradeoffs the scala community values power more and the clojure community values simplicity more.<p>Scala wants to provide you with the most powerful language possible. Clojure wants to make it easy for you to mold your own language.<p>Scala language tooling works at compile-time and analyses the language statically. Clojure language tooling connects to a running environment and uses introspection. Scala has much better static checking and clojure has much better introspection. While both languages have a repl, the clojure community puts much more emphasis on live, interactive programming.<p>Clojures syntactic extension mechanisms are much simpler, being based on sexps. Scalas are powerful (eg can access the lexical environment) but much more heavy-weight.<p>Clojure has run-time eval. This makes it possible to do eg domain-specific jit (eg compiling DSLs -> clojure code -> java bytecode on the fly). Scala has a run-time interpreter which I haven&#x27;t used but is reputed to be slow.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet explored non-jvm backends for scala but I suspect that clojure will eventually dominate on that front for two reasons: 1) when clojure-in-clojure is finished porting clojure to a new platform will be far easier than scala and 2) clojure was designed from the beginning to be a parasitic language and delegates many features to the underlying platform.<p>Scala breaks backwards compatibility much more often than clojure. Whether this is a pro or con is up for debate. There are lots of small niggling things in clojure I would like to change but on the other hand maintaining scala code across compiler updates is a pain in the ass.<p>Personally, I believe that the number one problem a language needs to address is managing complexity. The clojure community largely seems to get that and is driving for simple, orthogonal language features and libraries to an extent that I&#x27;ve not seen in any other community (eg <a href=""http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2012/10/1/prismatics-graph-at-strange-loop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2012/10/1/prismatics-graph...</a>).

It comes from the fact that heavier isotopes need slightly more energy for a phase change and thus get enriched in the fluid phase. In the case of water, it is mainly the stable O18 (as opposed to the abundant O16).<p>- Lighter isotopes evaporate easier and precipitate down on land. If they don&#x27;t return to the ocean for a long time due to freezing and glaciation, the ocean has a higher ratio of heavy to light isotopes. More ice means lower ocean level, and since the ratio in the ocean is dependent on the missing water mass, calculations directly give the sea level.<p>Now how do we know what the isotope ratio was in the past?<p>In the oceans, there are those small animals (foraminifera) that build the oxigen from water into their shells. The Wikipedia article you found discusses this. (Another fractionation process, add more calculations here. Additional temperature dependance.) When they die, they float to the ocean floor and, in time, form sediments and eventually lime rock, which can be drilled for probes.<p>Furthermore, different kinds live in different depths, giving us even more information. This can be used for the past 70 million years, since that&#x27;s the age of the oldest ocean floors. Almost (!) everything older has been subducted again. However, it is not easy to disentangle the temperature effect from the ice volume effect.<p>You can check those out, if you&#x27;re interested, they explain more thoroughly than the wikipedia article:<p>shorter lecture script:

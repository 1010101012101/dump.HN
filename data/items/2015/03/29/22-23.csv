It also makes impossible generalizations such as this one:<p>&quot;Most Romans, like Augustus, thought cruelty to slaves was shocking.&quot;<p>For a different perspective, I&#x27;d recommend some of Elaine Pagel&#x27;s work on the early Christian movement, in particular:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Adam-Eve-Serpent-Politics-Christianity/dp/0679722327/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1427669027&sr=8-10&keywords=elaine+pagels"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Adam-Eve-Serpent-Politics-Christianity...</a><p>In &quot;Adam, Eve, and the Serpent: Sex and Politics in Early Christianity&quot; Pagel&#x27;s makes clear that slaveowners could rape their female slaves. Some of the early Christian leaders denounced this practice, and argued that slave owners had no right to rape their female slaves. In this, the early Christians represented a dramatic break with the culture of Rome. And this is also why Nietzsche once referred to the early Christian movement as a slave revolt.<p>Unless you don&#x27;t think that rape is cruel, it is accurate to say that slaveowners believed in cruelty to slaves. From everything I&#x27;ve read, these kinds of horrors were closer to the norm than the exception:<p>&quot;Vedius Pollio, a rich Roman, once invited his friend the emperor Augustus to dinner. The entertainment was interrupted when a slave broke a valuable crystal cup. Trying to impress with his toughness, Vedius ordered the slave boy be thrown to the huge moray eels in his fish pond.&quot;<p>And good god, let&#x27;s not learn management techniques by studying dictators such as this:<p>&quot;But Augustus was not impressed. In fact, he was outraged at this novel form of cruelty. He ordered Vedius to free the slave boy and told the other slaves to bring all the crystal cups they could find and smash them in their master’s presence. He then told Vedius to fill in the fish pond and get rid of the moray eels.&quot;<p>This whole bit somehow succeeds at being innocent, stupid, shocking, deplorable, wrong and offensive all at once:<p>&quot;Most Romans, like Augustus, thought cruelty to slaves was shocking. They understood that slaves could not simply be terrified into being good at their job.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a cold hard fact: if you are a slave owner, then you are cruel. It is a simple matter of definition: to be a slave owner means that if someone does what they wish with their life, you are prepared to beat them, torture them, imprison them, or even kill them, to be sure they do not have the freedom to do what they want to do with their life.<p>Any article that suggests that it is possible to be a non-cruel slave owner is an article that does not understand what slavery is.",1427669633

But all of this seems to be ignored in proving the original statement that TDD take 15-35% longer, which appears to be backed by what is described as &quot;Management Estimates&quot; [Table 3].<p>In fact, taking the geometric mean of the man month values (which, I <i>think</i>, but am not sure is the right metric to use when comparing ratios), we find the average ratio to be 0.947x.

Primitive states massacred their enemies, their leaders unable to apply force in any more sophisticated fashion. It required more complex states to produce the ability to effectively enslave defeated foes in large numbers instead, but once that was achieved states capable of it thrived at the expensive of others.<p>There is little to chose from between Roman slavery and Medieval serfdom. Long-term colonial economic exploitation had many of the same aspects even where it wasn&#x27;t outright slavery. The institution of slavery in its broadest sense has proven to be very resilient. It is probably too soon to say whether its comparative absence for a few centuries is a passing thing, or whether it is in fact the symptom of another systematic shift in the sophistication of states. If the latter, then the introduction of modern systems of banking has an interesting parallel course in history. Consider all of the associated means for better extracting wealth from populations without provoking rebellion.<p>One might put forward an argument that suggests these advances make it more practical for the elite to comparatively peacefully farm the local population rather than farming other populations by making and enslaving enemies. Thus more of the elites do this.<p>All of which still leaves us with a very long to go yet in order to become a moral species. I don&#x27;t see it happening without fundamental engineered changes to human nature, and that isn&#x27;t a near term thing. It is worth remembering that a thin line indeed separates present elites in so-called civilized regions from those who in the past massacred and enslaved.

9286750,comment,9286642,9286642,0,0,chimeracoder,,,"I&#x27;ve used GopherJS. I actually gave a talk just this past week about full-stack Go[0] (ie, using Go for native mobile/desktop, and client-side web development in addition to server-side), and GopherJS was, unsurprisingly, a bit part of that.<p>GopherJS works surprisingly well; the biggest issue for most people will be the unminified file size. But based on my initial profiling, between minifiers, caching, and the fact that many websites are serving large assets (images) already, it&#x27;s less of an issue than I had anticipated it would be.<p>The second biggest issue is the fact that almost nobody writes raw Javascript anymore these days in the browser. Most people use not only JQuery (or a similar tool), but something to structure client-side code, like React.js or Angular.js.<p>GopherJS has an implementation of JQuery[1], which works about as well as JQuery itself does - that is, it does the job, but can get unmaintainable when there is a lot of client-side code. There is a GopherJS implementation of Angular.js, though I haven&#x27;t used it.<p>Until a month ago, there was a lingering quirk with the way GopherJS handled asynchronous code (calls to blocking functions had to be specially marked with comments, which meant that parts of the  standard library couldn&#x27;t be used be used without modification). They just fixed this a month ago[2], which is a huge milestone for the project.<p>React is a bit trickier, given the way that React applications are structured, and the way that React interacts with Javascript-specific features (namely the &quot;this&quot; keyword). It&#x27;s currently usable, but with insane filesize[3]. I think this could be slimmed down, since almost no work has been done optimizing this so far, but React-on-GopherJS is certainly not production-ready yet.<p>That said, that&#x27;s only looking at compiling existing Javascript code to Go. My hope is that the next client-side MVC/MVVC/etc. framework will be written in Go from the start. Go is a great language for structuring client-side code; the only bottleneck (until now) was that there was no way of actually running the code! But now that GopherJS is in a working state, it&#x27;s a completely green field - very exciting time.<p>[0] <a href=""https://chimeracoder.github.io/full-stack-go-client-slides/#1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chimeracoder.github.io/full-stack-go-client-slides/#...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/gopherjs/jquery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gopherjs/jquery</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/issues/89"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/issues/89</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/issues/118"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/issues/118</a>",1427668597

But there are plenty of dark net markets that aren&#x27;t Silk Road.<p>Since Silk Road 2 was taken down by the feds (sometime last year, around 6-9 months ago I think) the first to look like the biggest was Agora, then Evolution quickly became the most popular due to its nicer functionality (and nicer design), and the fact that Agora often has short periods of downtime due to server load.<p>Evolution disappeared a few weeks ago, seemingly the owner(s) decided to &quot;exit scam&quot; - i.e. shut down with no warning and steal all BTC stored in the site by vendors/buyers, thought to be worth $8m (plus whatever profit they made from commission in the previous year).<p>Since then it has been assumed that Agora will take the top spot, however it has had very bad availability with long periods of the site going down, I believe they&#x27;ve publicly said this is due to the influx of Evolution users and that they are working on improving their site infrastructure. The two biggest down sides to Agora are that they don&#x27;t offer Multisig support (see below), and that their site design/functionality is pretty nasty. Their upside is that they have the most vendors on there, so the best range of drugs to buy. I believe (though could be wrong, it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve been on there) they don&#x27;t allow vendors to sell fraud/etc. related items, so stuff like Uber accounts wouldn&#x27;t be allowed on there. Not sure on that, though.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of other markets too though, ranging in size and pros/cons - a basic list can be found at <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/wiki/superlist"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/wiki/superlist</a><p>Right now there&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around regarding which markets to trust, how long they&#x27;ll last, etc.<p>Side note on multisig: what this is is basically a three-way escrow. Traditionally dark net markets offered either &quot;finalize early&quot; (vendor gets your BTC as soon as you order) or &quot;escrow&quot; (website stores the BTC until customer is happy to release to vendor, or until the site admins have to decide who to give them to in the case of a dispute). Multisig means that two out of the three parties (site, vendor, buyer) must agree before the BTC gets released to anyone. So this would prevent markets from doing what Evolution did (stealing all the money in escrow), as if they shut down with no warning then any outstanding deals could still be finalised between buyer and vendor (2 out of 3). However, Evolution was actually one of (if not the) first markets to introduce multisig as an option, and nearly everyone was too lazy to figure out how to use it. Most talk since then is along the lines of &quot;we should all be using multisig all the time&quot;, yet I still haven&#x27;t seen any signs of that happening...<p>Anyway, this reply is way longer than you actually asked about, I just think the world of dark net markets is pretty interesting :)",1427667893

Reviews of <i>Naqoyqatsi</i> (both the movie soundtrack and the concerto it turned into) frequently cite its &quot;melodic&quot; nature and &quot;lyrical melodic lines&quot; (BBC Music) and it is far from the only modern Glass piece to adopt a melodic approach (his epic first <i>Violin Concerto</i> comes to mind). Heck, I&#x27;m sure I even saw Glass and Yo Yo Ma being interviewed about Naqoyqatsi and how it was <i>designed</i> for the cello to drive a powerful melody to counteract the technological nature of the movie (note that <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i> was the other way around - more &#x27;mechnical&#x27; electronic music set to scenes of the natural world).<p>One problem some new to Glass can encounter is Glass&#x27;s melodies frequently occur in lower registers on instruments that don&#x27;t generally play melodies, particularly in his operas, leaving the traditionally melodic instruments to instead provide the rhythm. Appomattox provides modern examples of this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J14flyMOQo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J14flyMOQo</a>",1427667392

With respect to the preciseness of the definitions I have likely misinterpreted this. Is the system the algorithm itself or is it the system it lives in? I assumed the latter which may well be a mistake.<p>Each thread under the algorithm can perform their actions in a finite number of steps without ever blocking. This means the producers can continue to do other work. The consumer can continue to consume from other log buffers without being blocked and complete in a finite number of steps. If a producer is killed mid operation then no further progress can be made on that log buffer. If this is considered blocking then the algorithm is blocking and therefore not wait-free. It would need to be killed by another malicious thread for this to happen.<p>What is clear is that this algorithm gives the best latency profile of of all the measured messaging systems and the highest throughput.

Not sure why the creator of the squirrel project used a camera though when a cheaper, more robust sensor would work unless he was eventually thinking of extending its usage for more than simple motion detection.<p>[1] <a href=""http://vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/20q.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/20q.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/ipadapp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/ipadapp.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/welinder/cubam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/welinder/cubam</a>",1427666763

And for things that don&#x27;t <i>matter</i>, sure, worse-is-better your life away; a Rails app can be whatever you want, but the infrastructure <i>I</i> manage had better be bulletproof. I won&#x27;t say etcd will never be <i>competitive</i>, but without some significant changes, I don&#x27;t see it getting my vote--and those changes are largely around the parts of the feature set that etcd doesn&#x27;t support, at which point...why use it, anyway?",1427666650

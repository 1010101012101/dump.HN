Easy influx of money, both in interest rates by joining the Euro (more borrowing but not fault or EU per se) and influx of money from EU to close specific industries and/or production of goods (Agriculture for example) was a problem. Also, at least in Portugal, during this crisis there were incentives to buy new cars that were influenced by EU. This benefited some countries but countries that do not have an auto industry were screwed. Also for example, there were added taxes from pakistan on textile products. When the floods hit, EU wanted to lift those taxes as a whole, hurting a lot of countries that have a good amount of people employed in those industries.<p>These are the examples I mention with interfering. A central parliament where the members are payed an enormous amount of money to be there (yes, I also have a problem with the money and benefits they get there), deciding for the whole EU where individual countries get shafted because some countries (UK, Germany, France and Italy together get more than 50% of votes) can get a majority easily and can look after their own interests.",1322826265

It is usually said that Haskell uses monads and Clean uses uniqueness types. This is partly true. A more accurate explanation that monads and uniqueness types are distinct features that can coincidentally both be used to manage state. Haskell doesn't have uniqueness types. Clean has both, and you can use either, but the developers prefer uniqueness types. Having tried both methods, I'd say that uniqueness types are easier to understand but monads give cleaner structure to the code.<p>I see so many laments from people who tried Haskell and gave up.

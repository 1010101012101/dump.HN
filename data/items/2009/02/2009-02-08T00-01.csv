So, if IQ has permeated the school system as an important metric, it makes sense that children will be trained to do well on IQ tests.  As it is, the article states the IQ increase correlates well with better education, health, and family structure.<p>Also, at the end of the article, it states there are indications the IQ increase has stopped, and may be reversing, in the Western world.",1234054634

If it had not been possible to get ""no money down"" loans and to extract 100% of equity from a property through refinancing, there probably wouldn't have been such a bubble.<p>Just as the the Federal Reserve was given the responsibility to set margin requirements for stock market investing, which most likely protected the system from bank failures during the internet bubble, it seems like a good reform in mortgage lending would be a regulation that limits the amount that a home buyer or real estate investor is permitted to borrow when purchasing real property.",1234054243

Learning how to fine tune your head shot or climb onto weird locations is clever and skillful, but they are extremely niche skills and require very little high level thinking, which is much more difficult.<p>The more a medium encourages deep, abstract, logical thought, such as some of the old school strategy games, the better.  In this way, people start to grasp principles more than just specialized behaviors.  But, the more people become only specialized, the less they can communicate effectively with people not in their specialty, and the more misunderstanding, wheel reinvention, tunnel vision, etc. results.

471635,comment,471519,471555,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"BASH in compatibility mode will run almost anything written for sh, plus a few extras.  It's the few extras that caused me problems when I was working on FreeBSD, Solaris and Ubuntu 8.04 support.  If you are careful not to use those extras, you'll be fine.  Unfortunately, not using those extras makes programming in sh even less pleasant.  The [[ test operator and the substitution/substring operators were probably the most annoying, in my case--it's easy to convert, it just ratchets up the line count a bit, and you have to be even more careful about what you feed it.<p>Mostly, I found everything I needed in this Ubuntu guide:<p><a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh</a><p>So, the BASH/sh dichotomy is not traumatic, by any means.  At least not on the platforms I've dealt with it (which, so far, is only Linux of many flavors, FreeBSD, and Solaris--so there may be more issues in the future).  But, since there are so many other negatives to working in sh for anything more complicated than a one-off script, I'd probably go for a language better equipped for modularity.  Since Perl is pretty close to standard on every UNIX I've ever used, I don't think you lose much, if anything, in the way of cross-platform.",1234053994

There are also a lot of large Java platforms out there (e.g. Internet Banking platforms) that are no longer under active development - maintenance and feature enhancements only.<p>Organisations that once had large Java engineering rooms seem to be breaking them up.<p>The biggest influence is outsourcing and offshoring. To an extend, big corporates don't really care about the underlying tech - they outsource to (say) Infosys and it's up to them how they actually implement it... and as a result, this varies greatly. The big outsourcers are still dominated by Java and C# (which C# gaining ground). The smaller vendors are much more varied, with Ruby and Python starting to feature a lot.<p>In terms of new technology, there is a focus on things like Process Automation, Business Rules Engines, etc. I worked on a large imaging/workflow project recently that was almost entirely Ajax + Process Engine + Business Rules Engine....

471628,comment,470695,471325,0,0,yters,,,"First of all, where do I say people do not deserve responsibility for genius?  They just do not deserve sole responsibility.  I do not think genius is without effort.  Genius requires supreme effort.<p>But, do you think there's a difference between the deep insights we call genius and someone who achieves a lot?  I do.  The people who are most celebrated for such insights vs. only being prolific seem to have a common claim to a transcendent source of insight.  Off the top of my head: Homer, Plato, Dante, Einstein.  Plus, Bach dedicated his work to God, not the church.<p>Like the speaker says, people saying that they are the genius is very recent.  Having read a fair amount of the Western corpus, I'd agree.  Makes sense too from an etymological standpoint, since genius means some kind of spirit, like genie.  Plus, the individualist attitude seems to coincide with a derth in good art, so it looks like modern artists are missing something.  It also leads to the really lame idea that good art means being totally original, which actually results in no one being original and mostly just incoherent instead.  Finally, for what it's worth, my own experience validates this idea.  Any ideas that seem truly good to me seem to be something outside of myself that I've grasped.  Haven't you had this same experience?",1234053076

471626,comment,471579,471579,0,0,palish,,,"I found my first job by going to my highschool job fair and begging a guy from Boeing to let me work as a programmer.  He told me I was too young (just turned 17 at the time) but since I was ""highly motivated"" he would call some friends on my behalf.  He referred me to a local business that develops frimware.  After I explained that I had been developing game development skills for years using C++, they said I'd probably be a better fit at Ageia (a St Louis company that developed physics middleware called PhysX, and was recently acquired by nVidia).<p>I thought, ""How am I going to get the attention of the executives?  I'm 17, there's no way I can just submit a resume and get hired.""  So I scoured the internet for any Ageia phone numbers I could find.  I called one of them, and a guy who spoke Chinese picked up.  ""Um... hello?"" and he hung up.  But I noticed a pattern in all of the numbers I found.  They all started with the same 5 digits (for example, 555-1212, 555-1286, etc).  So I changed the last two digits to 01 and tried, and nobody picked up.  Then I tried 02 and got one of the top execs on the phone.  I convinced him to let me show him some of my gamedev demos the following day.  After that, he told me that he was impressed, but to prove my skills, I had two weeks to create a demo using PhysX.  Two weeks later, I had created three simple but effective demos.<p>He seemed pretty impressed at that point, and even told me ""you definitely have a job here"".  Then I didn't.  He couldn't get special permission to hire a 17-year old, because I couldn't sign the NDA.  But he asked John Ratcliff (who worked at Ageia at the time) if he knew of any local companies I'd be a good fit at.  He did, and it turned out that there was a gamedev studio about 30 minutes away from where I lived.  I was really excited, and they invited me to take their programmer test.<p>The guy who handed me the test said ""I hope you know your C++""... he wasn't exactly confident in me, apparently.  (I don't blame him, most candidates suck.)  But I took the test and got a decent score.  Up next was the interview phase, where around 8 programmers came in and sat at a large table in the conference room.  I presented my demos to them (including my three previous Ageia demos).<p>I dropped out of high school and worked there as an unpaid intern for about 8 months, at which point I was hired and worked there for three years.  Also, the time between the job fair and my first day on the job was several months, so the whole process took a lot of effort.<p>So my advice is, demos are key; talk to the decision-makers, not the middlemen; and demonstrate your skill in every other possible way (but mostly shut up and let other people talk, because you don't know 1/10th of what you think you know).<p>Also, be genuinely interested in other people.  Almost everyone likes the idea of being a mentor.",1234052622

You can feel a bit weird if someone goes ""beers for everyone?"", everyone's agreeing and you're the one that has to go ""no thanks, a coke would be nice"". Or worse, just order it and put it in front of you. People do tend to assume everyone drinks beer.<p>(For me, that's not true. I don't mind alcohol, but I can't stand the taste of beer. I can't finish a zip of it, let alone a glass. I do sometimes have to explain that. Since I'm old enough to have a driver's license I sometimes have the nice excuse that I still need to drive. Works a bit better in that it requires less explanation.)",1253097999

825554,comment,824332,824462,0,0,JMostert,,,"""If anything, cancer resistance (which would probably mean less cell mutation ability) would be disadvantageous from an evolution standpoint because you would have less variation and consequently may have trouble adapting.""<p>Evolution doesn't work that way. It doesn't favor mutation because mutation is ""good"" for evolution. You have to look at it from individual genes, and there the story is just the opposite.<p>Evolution happens in spite of, not because of genetic predisposition to mutation, because it's vastly more likely for a mutation to be pointless or harmful than beneficial. If you have a gene that makes mutation in the genepool overall less likely, that gene will be more successful at spreading itself, because the mutants have, <i>on the whole</i>, far less chance of success than the originals (which have already proven their worth in a long chain of ancestor individuals carrying them). Of course every so often a mutant gets lucky and is more successful (or at least not less successful) than the original -- this is what selection is all about -- but statistics are against them.<p>To elaborate your scenario: suppose the environment changed very rapidly, and adaptation in some direction were necessary to survive it. If by some stroke of luck a gene that increased the mutation rate happened to be there at that moment, defying the odds, it would find a favorable environment, but only for as long as the rapid change is required. Generalizing this: a successful genepool is one where the mutation rate is ""just right"" for adapting to the environment. Too much mutation and the genepool isn't stable and will eliminate itself, too little mutation and the genepool will be eliminated by the environment. In this balance, the odds are stacked in favor of avoiding mutation.<p>And all this is orthogonal to the discussion of how cancer (the uncontrolled reproduction of cells) is related to the capacity for mutations (infidelity in the copying process). Cancer resistance and mutation resistance are related, but by no means the same thing. To borrow a computer image: your computer has copy processes with very high fidelity (only the occasional alpha particle to spoil the fun) but this doesn't protect it against worms, which copy themselves unwantedly but with the same high fidelity. This analogy is badly flawed in obvious ways (regular programs are not designed to copy themselves, cells are), but I hope it gets the point across.",1253097545

It says that the youths themselves feel they should be doing something else, not some old, stodgy institution.</i><p>They aren't old enough to define worthwhile ways to spend their time all by themselves. Their sense of what people are supposed to be doing with their time is going to be affected by the educational institution which has very poor sense of how to efficiently factor technology into education. So it's likely that they will be feeling a conflict, even if a properly guided use of technology would actually lead to an equal or better education.<p>For a parallel, imagine what things would look like if the educational establishment was dead-set on teaching oral tradition, the students were literate, but the use of written word would be pretty much dismissed in proper education in favor of recitation and rhetoric. The students would be left to their own devices with coming up uses for writing. The students would probably mostly use writing in pretty useless ways and occasionally feel guilty about not spending more time learning to recite the sagas of macroeconomic world history and the verse for basic electrodynamic theory.",1253096825

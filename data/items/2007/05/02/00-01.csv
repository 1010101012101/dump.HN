Media temple will sell 1TB chunks on shared hosting for $20/month.<p>I've seen dedicated hosts that price bandwidth above their included allotment at $500 per TB.  You can also buy based on peak bandwidth.<p>You'll see quite a range depending on business models, peak transfer caps, etc.  Mediatemple, for example, is clearly hoping that most people will never need their full allotment, and when they do, they only need it occasionally.",1178066681
18534,comment,18437,18462,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I thought about the ""more"" part a little, just a little; there are some important problems to think through before carrying this further. First of all, it only provides a substitute functionality; if news.yc gets PM then this is totally unnecessary. For more features, there are more ambitious projects like medium (I'm not sure if they're in the same category).<p>Second, being an unofficial product degrades credibility by a lot; there's no reason why a user would expect to find messages for them on an external server. I imagine this as a disposable tool, like mailinator, in case some people want to trade emails or other non-public data without having to write here or disclose anything personal. Post and delete. For this specific purpose I do think its useful, but how much further beyond the audience especially concerned about privacy, I don't know.<p>Third, loading an external page in a frame can confuse and annoy users, so I think it's not a good practice. news.yc users might tolerate this kind of hack because they know what's behind it, but I can't say for sure.<p>Of course, if you have other thoughts/suggestions, do let me know, publicly or privately :)",1178066594

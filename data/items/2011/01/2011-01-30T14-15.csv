I don't see it happening though as I wrote in an earlier thread I think it would be trivial and I'm sure they have a playbook on exactly how to do it that gets kept up-to-date, 'just in case'. But I think even the government does not have a clue as to what circumstances would prompt them to trigger this based on the current state of affairs. I just think that they find it hard to live with the idea that if TSHTF that they have something that might potentially be hard to control. Think of it as a control issue, not something with immediate applicability. A kill switch is a pretty blunt instrument of control, I'm sure the powers that be can come up with more subtle ways of dealing with issues like that.<p>Americans are no longer capable of revolution, this goes for any country in the world where the standard of living is high enough and people are for the most part happy with their lives including Western Europe and Australia. There simply isn't enough reason to do it, not enough people with nothing left to lose. There are simply no issues important enough to people any more to get out of their comfy chairs and go on to the streets. Witness what happened in France with the civil unrest there a few years ago, it was the kids with nothing left to lose that vented their anger, but they were (and continue to be) only a small fraction of the total population.<p>If a dictator should come to power (which you can never really rule out, even in a democracy) then that may change but it won't change overnight. It took 30 years for Egypt to get to that stage, it took more than 40 years in the former East Block countries.<p>Revolutions happen when the pot boils over, it has to be on the fire for a long long time gathering pressure and heat before that happens.<p>Ironically, if a kill switch were implemented <i>and</i> triggered the masses no longer having access to facebook and entertainment might be just enough reason for them to get out on the streets.",1296399187

So if you think oil is mispriced in the 20-year timeframe, oil futures don't do you any good.<p>There seems to be a persistent misbelief that futures markets are a way of hedging or speculating on long-term price movements, but they're really a way of hedging or speculating on short-term price movements, e.g. for airlines to hedge against near-term supply shocks.

Twitter is great if you have a contextual based social game like mafia wars and not an avatar based game like farmville.Create corresponding pages or faces as I call them for you various brands.Also Yahoo has a Developers kit which allows you to post your game to it's Game page.This is especially useful because Yahoo is in a position where it's trying to expand it's listing of social games.I've heard from sources that contacting them directly through there dev page is a great way to get some free exposure for your game.Another great site to use is orkut which is googles social platform which is really ignorned by the tech media but it boasts over 20mil members mainly in the Americas which is staggering in it's own right.You have to understand the bigger players use there muscle to dominate on Facebook so as little guys you have to use a broader strategy.Focus on getting your app on as many social platforms as possible.Another strategy to use is to expand rapidly to international markets.There are major SNS platforms in Asian countries that are looking for American branded social applications.Case in point I just got approved to port my social app to Mobage which is a Japense SNS owned by Dena.So you might be thinking why Japan,well because on average they spend about $20ptc on in game purchases while Americans spend an average of $3.00. Porting your game and game translations is quite easy to accomplish.There is another one in China called RenRen,Ive reached out to RenRen also.Please learn to be patient with these foreign companies because of logistic issues it may take up to a month for them to ge back to you.So don't be discouraged use your creativity and expand aggressively into international markets and you have a great chance of reaching the scale of your larger competitors.",1296398123

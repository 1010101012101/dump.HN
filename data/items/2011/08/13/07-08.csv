But, Apple has been frustrated in the past with their processor manufacturing partners, and there is no doubt in my mind that, now that they own their own processor, they have a planned roadmap that will switch portions of their product line over to the A-series processors. I also think there are clear signs that OS X will eventually be replaced by iOS, at least in the non-server product lines.<p>Linux is usually a good option, unfortunately there's a specific hardware configuration on my laptop that makes it nearly unusable.

2880570,comment,2880196,2880196,10,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Amusing article :) -- but in all seriousness I have been subject to many of the effects of caffeine overdose.  Some days I might drink over 800 mg (the rough equivalent of 8 cups of coffee), via energy drinks, soda, and/or espresso.  My stomach suffered a lot from the acidity, including acid reflux and damage to my stomach lining (mostly from soda - also, inconclusively, I suspect my appendicitis may have been related to this abuse).  I would undergo ""panic attacks"" - i.e. adrenaline rushes, especially after exercising or during the summer and sometimes sweat like crazy in public.  My sleep hours became backwards since I was self-employed - I would wake up at night and sleep through the day most of the time.  I even tried quitting once for about a month, but could not handle the constant fatigue.  All in the name of keep my mental gears turning to be a ""better"" programmer :)",1313221854
2880569,comment,2877779,2880467,2,0,derefr,,,"> You people<p>Are you trying to speak to the reference class that includes me? I don't drink coffee (I dislike the taste, but I wouldn't say I hate it), but I also don't have a Starbucks anywhere close enough to me that I would bother to visit it. The only thing I've done with this card is read about it.<p>Now, what I am is a game designer. What I'm trying to say by calling this a ""social experiment,"" is that a system has been created here with technical restrictions, but no social restrictions—rules, but not norms. Just because, at first glance, it shares some attributes in common with systems that <i>do</i> have norms, such as good will funds, does not mean that that is what it is. Basically, what we're talking about here is a game.<p>Note that <i>what something is</i> and <i>what something was designed to be</i> are entirely different facts about that thing. The game I mentioned above, Chain World, was <i>designed</i> to be a semi-religious experience in the passing of a unique gameworld from one person to another. However, the system, as expressed through its rules, does not hold to that experience; instead, it is largely a game of keep-away and fundraising where whoever has the game, makes the rules, and the aspect of the playing of the ""inner game"" (the one on the USB stick) has fallen away almost entirely.<p>Similarly, although the intention behind this social experiment might have been to create a charity, the system as expressed through its rules does not make for a charity. It makes for something between gambling and leaving money laying on the street. It would be very simple, technically, to enforce socially-normative usage of the card such that it <i>would be</i> a charity—but that was not done, which means that a charity was not the strict intent, leaving people free to interpret the intent of the game as they please.<p>Also, if you think an experiment like this could possibly demonstrate ""that most people are basically good,"" you're quite far off—the fact that the system is voluntary to join, and that consequences from inside the system do not leak outside, creates what in game design is called a Magic Circle[1]: a division between the social norms of the outer and inner ""realities."" When such a division is created, a new set of norms (a ""social contract"") is established between the players of the game, usually reflecting game-theoretically-optimal behavior considering the technical restrictions of the game world. For example, in the social contract of the players of a fighting game, the exploitation of bugs in the game to win is both allowed and encouraged.<p>Those who try to apply the social norms of the outer reality (such as fairness, generosity, etc.) to the reality within the magic circle, are usually considered to be wrong-headed by those who form the community of players of a game. They are called ""scrubs""[2], and they call the tactics of the game's community ""cheap."" Basically, this is what you seem to be doing.<p>Now, of course, if you really see the card as a charity, and not a game, then you'll tend to be angry at the people who do see it as a game—just like people are angry at the financial industry for seeing US debt as a game instead of some moral imperative to fix, or like people are angry at pharmaceutical companies for seeing drug creation as a game instead of a moral imperative, or like people are angry at spammers for seeing selling viagra as a game instead of a moral imperative (to not do, in that case.) But none of these people will change, because the systems they're participating in create incentives for their (game-theoretically-optimal) behavior, rather than for what, outside the magic circle, would be ""moral"" behavior. To change the behavior, you either redesign the game to have different incentives—or you destroy the magic circle by allowing the consequences to leak, such as by making certain in-game actions have out-of-game legal consequences, and thus make the game into whatever sort of moral system it would be in regular, polite society.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Circle_(synthetic_worlds)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Circle_(synthetic_worlds)</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/intermediates-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/intermediates-guide.html</a>",1313221827

The primary reason I ditched it was I just didn't see enough money there (for the business) and also thought the auction prices would end up too low to attract quality people to put their time up for auction. Are you going to stick with the ""one at a time"" format you have now?  Really cool concept because I for one would happily pay a lot for quick access to experts on certain niche topics.  (Currently I just cyber-stalk experts and offer money if it makes sense...)",1313218943

I see some inefficiencies in what he's doing (doesn't track hours with a clock, writes them down on a sticky note before copying them into Basecamp), but convincing him is going to be hard because he's very stubborn about his ways.<p>I also want to maintain visibility of what he's doing, along with the other staff, so I haven't found a good replacement yet.

1314361,comment,1314300,1314300,0,0,pquerna,,,"I guess I'm not gorking how the behavior of write() blocking when fsync is being called is considered a problem.<p>write() is documented and well known to be a potentially blocking function, for potentially a long time.  If you are writing a small-number-of-threads process, that is doing Disk and Network IO in the same threads, you can definitely starve out the network IO when the disk system starts thrashing, but generally that is fine, because you can't keep up with new requests at that point anyways.<p>For that matter, read() can block too, people are just 'used' to their Kernels being smart and most important data being in cache.<p>If you want your event-style threads servicing network clients to be able to use write() or read without 'blocking' up a whole thread for apparently random times, consider using the aio_* style write/fsync, although you definitely would want to benchmark their impacts on general performance.<p>If you don't want to use aio_*, which is likely to be.. dangerous ground considering how few people use them, you end up adding threads to provide more isolation and parallelism to IO.",1272876717

And then I realized that the last chart has confounds. Intelligence and vocabulary are correlated, but worth differentiating in this case.<p>A higher vocabulary is pretty strongly correlated with being well-read. I think we can trust that. And being well-read implies being exposed to different things (though it is by no means the only way to be exposed to different things -- i.e., those who are well-read [subset operator] those who are exposed to a wide variety of things.<p>But those who are exposed to a wide variety of things are highly correlated with those who wish to take risks <i>to be</i> exposed to new things.

When I was a kid it was a bit of a luxury to own any kind of computer and I wanted one so bad that I basically learned programming (in C) from books and wrote my code on a piece of paper all the time so that once I get access to computer or parents buy me my own I would already be ""prepared"". As it turned out this helped me along the way to clearly present ideas to others on whiteboard or paper (code, that is). However there is still that bit of ""experimentation"" with code even on paper. Heck, I don't know anyone that can write code perfect from one go, you have to dance around an idea a bit first before you get what feels right to you.<p>tl;dr; Paper/Whiteboard is just a different IDE you have to get used to.",1272876288

Does that mean it is good for the ecosystem on the whole? No.<p>80% of internet.org users are users with existing data plans. How hard do you think it is to get someone switch over from free to paid? Even for a person of privilege, he will prefer a free meal over a paid meal unless there is a huge difference in quality of a free meal (e.g. bread) vs. paid plan (e.g. steak). Considering that only well capitalised companies can provide free meals, you have just made the uphill battle that startups everyday fight against BigCos into a vertical slope.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be like this. The Delhi Government is going to soon roll out a free neutral Internet covering large parts of the city. There are many models of free Internet implemented all over the world.<p>We&#x27;ll get connectivity to the millions, but it won&#x27;t be on Facebook terms - it&#x27;ll be on the terms as decided by a democratically elected nation.",1430755193

It&#x27;s not that you can continue writing your Perl 5 program/library in Perl 6.<p>This approach is not only really bad for performance, it&#x27;s also very limited.

I was sold pretty much instantly on the test drive and four years later I still love it. Once you&#x27;re on the move, it&#x27;s very relaxing, like an ambient music track, with a cheeky whirring noise in the background that becomes more evident when it gets going.<p>When you&#x27;re sat stationary with the engine idling, the gear knob and foot pedals shudder, and there&#x27;s a slight juddering through the steering wheel. Some might think of this as unrefined, and possibly even agricultural, but I find it actually quite comforting. At such low revs the engine also sounds rather clattery... but I don&#x27;t mind. At least you know it&#x27;s still there.<p>(I had a courtesy car a couple of years ago with an engine that was undetectable while idling - and I ended up not liking it! It was so nice to have my car back, with its reassurring vibrations and its clattery engine sound.

9486959,comment,9484412,9486436,0,0,lotsofmangos,,,"I may be being overly cynical, but given the blog is dedicated to showing how high technology solutions cannot work and has articles about PV generation leading with the claim that solar can be often worse than coal, before you drill down and realise that they are not talking about generation, but have segued into running the figures on what happens when they are glued to the casings of laptops and mobile phones ( <a href=""http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/03/the-ugly-side-o.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/03/the-ugly-side-o.html</a> ), I think they are trying to find numbers to back an established view, rather than adjusting the viewpoint to the numbers.<p>---<p>edit - Actually, to be honest, I do not think in this case I am being overly cynical. The article I linked to, titled <i>&quot;The ugly side of solar panels&quot;</i> starts with:<p><i>&quot;New research shows, albeit unintentional, that generating electricity with solar panels can also be a very bad idea. In some cases, producing electricity by solar panels releases more greenhouse gases than producing electricity by gas or even coal.&quot;</i><p>This claim is then not really addressed till right at the end of the article, where we find the following:<p><i>&quot;For rooftop and ground-base installations, the eco-friendliness can be good or doubtful, depending on the solar insolation and the life expectancy. But if we consider solar panels mounted on gadgets like laptops or mobile phones, solar energy becomes a plainly bad idea.</i><p><i>If we take a life expectancy of 3 years (already quite optimistic for most gadgets) and a solar insolation of 900 kWh/m² (quite optimistic too, since these things are not lying on a roof), the result is 1,038 gram CO2 per kWh in the worst case scenario (high-efficient mono-crystalline cells produced in the US). That means that it is better for the environment to power a gadget with electricity generated by coal, rather than by a solar panel.&quot;</i><p>So, if you buy a laptop or mobile with a solar panel on it and then throw it away after three years, then it is worse than coal.<p>Which is obviously a completely rational point to make on the subject, given all those masses of mobile phones and laptops sold everywhere with solar panels on them.<p>Then it gets even better:<p>&quot;<i>All this does not mean that PV solar energy should not be promoted. For one thing, it’s much better using silicon wafers to make energy generating equipment instead of energy guzzling equipment (like computers, mobile phones and car electronics).</i>&quot;<p>And by this point I am not sure if this is satire, or if the author thinks their website is hosted on a steam powered abacus.",1430755011

Being a concert pianist (or Lady Gaga or Floyd MayWeather) is competitive in such a way that the return on being the 1-in-a-thousand is way better than 1-in-ten. Way better.<p>Most things are not like that. In fact very few programmers even pursue that. Most science is not even like that.

I think that for the most part everybody can, just like for the most part everybody can learn high school calculus.<p>* The second is the question of whether programming ability is bimodal. This is not related to the first question, and confusing the two questions is a significant error. It is entirely possible that programming talent is strongly bimodal and that 99% of people can learn to program.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 11 and have interacted with other programmers all through high school, college, and now working life, and at every single point of my career -- both academic and professional -- I have seen that some people are drastically faster and better at programming than others (but the others are still capable of learning). In introductory programming courses at college, I&#x27;ve done labs with <i>very</i> smart people who took 10x longer to figure out the lab than some others. They figured it out, but they struggled a lot compared to others, despite being very distinguished undergraduates (Goldwater fellow, etc.).<p>At work, we&#x27;ve brought on people with 10 years of experience who were 10x slower than someone else with 2 years of experience.<p>At school, there were master&#x27;s degree candidates who were significantly worse than many undergraduates despite working just as hard and longer.<p>I could go on and on and on with examples.

Now when you look at an artist character they frequently are different, for example you might see a orc magician, or a space marine with low accuracy stats, high charisma and that paints his armour pink with yellow dots.<p>Then when we get to real work, the need for talent is obvious: Innate programmers frequently make boring art, IF they can make good art at all. Innate artists sometimes can make some code, but usually it is badly engineered code (prone to bugs and breaking), and that is, sometimes, most artists can&#x27;t code at all, you can try to teach them all you want, and they just don&#x27;t understand, even those that might grasp the syntax still end never getting past basic logic.<p>Of course, sometimes you find some people that are exceptions, for example the Falanghe brothers:<p>Felipe Falanghe is the creator of KSP, he, and his twin brother, studied with me at university, they are clearly artists, during university their highest grades were always in pure art related classes, they could make amazing drawings, and they had a band and were both fairly good singers and guitar players, yet both of them decided to learn Flash and Unity coding, and although their code was frequently broken, hard to read, confusing and had huge amount of memory leaks, clearly it was possible to do something with it, since KSP is a success, and Felipe Falanghe started coding it by himself in Unity.",1430754602

An American friend of mine who I worked with back in Baghdad helped us rent a place in Reston, a small town in Fairfax county. The rent was $1250 for a small 2 bedroom condo. For refugees like us with over 20K in debt, the rent was extremely high, but we wanted to be in this area because there were a lot more opportunities compared to other places we could have gone to. I was 23 years old at the time, and within five years I went from being a support engineer, to a support lead, then a manager, then a director, then a CEO of a Bain Capital Ventures backed company to now attempting to build my own company. Compared to many other Iraqis I know who were admitted as refugees and lived in other areas of the country, I am doing better than most (career wise). Granted, I had lots of help, and was lucky to have had the chance to work with and learn from many bright people, but I truly believe that being here in this area is one of the top reasons I had more success than others.

These are not insignificant advantages, of course, but people don&#x27;t realize that EVs are equal or better in all other respects.<p>It&#x27;s coming around now that EVs are getting more exposure, and especially since Tesla keeps getting so much attention for producing a car that&#x27;s good on its own merits, and not merely good &quot;for an EV.&quot;<p>The other side of this is that people are blind to the problems of gas cars, because they&#x27;ve grown up with them. One of the biggest problems people see with EVs is charging. But if you hadn&#x27;t grown up with gas vehicles, the idea of seeking out a specialized filling station once every week or two and then dispensing dangerous, toxic liquid fuel from an apparatus that doesn&#x27;t even seal it off from the outside would seem completely mad.

I read a story once about a guy trying to level up his skills to NFL-level. He spent weeks out on the field practicing his kick. He could hit the goal, but not reliably. One yard closer, and every kick sailed right in.<p>One of his buddies, a minor league baseball pitcher, went out with him one day, asked to give it a shot. On his very first try, he kicked it right in. A pitcher.<p>To be great, it requires getting out on the frontier of human ability. That frontier often looks very, very weird.

But one can only put so many hours of their day into an activity. So when you&#x27;re talking about greatness, talent ultimately matters more than hard work. One should ideally find out as quickly as possible whether one has the talent to make it out to the frontier of human ability.

Also, the lashing only constitutes a poor attitude if it is both lashing and also wrong. In this case it looks like correct and well-placed lashing to me. It might not be rational to do it since it won&#x27;t affect change, but it&#x27;s not a &quot;bad attitude&quot; to do it either.

Then, if anyone should be so audacious and arrogant as to desire some bit of intellectual prosperity in life while still earning a living wage, they must have a bad attitude, right?<p>Many employers, especially large bureaucratic ones, actively look to underemploy people. They foolishly model that surplus labor as a latent benefit or an extra assurance that the baseline labor required of the position will be more easily guaranteed. There is almost no effort to model surplus labor as a source of burnout and turnover. Such things are swept under the rug of &quot;bad attitude&quot; or &quot;not a team player&quot; or whatever other subversive codeword that HR-types want to put on it.<p>Often they are willing to pay above market rates <i>specifically to underemploy you</i>.

It works out for employers and the worker gets what they want and everyone is happy.<p>But if you are oriented internally, possibly at the genetic level, to be incapable of avoiding burnout and extreme, unsustainable job dissatisfaction when you are expected to be willfully underemployed, the system just can&#x27;t handle you. There is no attitude adjustment that will fix it -- you could have the nicest and most polite disposition of all time, while suavely executing interviews and wooing management -- it won&#x27;t matter.<p>Your unwillingness to be satisfied with underemployment is, in and of itself, considered toxic to bureaucracy. The bureaucracy system cannot function if intellectual prosperity is something it must actually provide for workers, rather than just merely paying lip service to it.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t have any answers except to say that I totally understand where the lashing out is coming from. It&#x27;s human. It&#x27;s coming from an urge to call bullshit on underemployment and to vent frustrations about systematic mistreatment of underemployed workers. It doesn&#x27;t speak to any attitude malfunction whatsoever, and labeling it as such is just one more of the many tactics that bureaucracy uses to expunge the so-called toxin.

Twenty years ago people laughed at electric cars with their maybe 30-40 miles of range and 8-12hour charging times. Tesla has done a lot to iron out most of these engineering problems and I applaud them for that. However, articles like this also smack of elitism, especially considering the 6 figure prices most Tesla vehicles sell for. I would love to own a Tesla, just as I would love to own a 2000 acre ranch estate with a huge mansion on it. When electric cars can compete in the range of commodity cars, then we can have this conversation about the merits of electric cars.<p>I just watched a video comparing the Dodge Charger Hellcat to a Tesla P-85d. Both have similar power, and while you can debate the level of quality of FCA vs Tesla you can still drive a Hellcat(which is an insane gas guzzler) for less money for 5-7 years depending on your yearly mileage. At that point, most people will likely purchase a new vehicle, and that is also assuming you only use free superchargers. A Tesla is definitely a luxury item, I get that, and there are other options. The problem is most current other options are more like the electric cars 20 years ago than a tesla.<p>Progress is being made and I am excited about that. I would love to have an electric commuter car as long as it could meet the following criteria.<p>1) seat 5 people comfortably
2) have 150+ miles of range(I drive about 120 miles per day)
3) cost between 30-50k
4) have reasonable performance(say comparable to a german sedan in that price range)
5) recharge quickly and easily, possibly have battery swap capability for the high use days
6) emphasize being a good car and not a &quot;green&quot; car. Im all for taking care of the environment, but will never buy a car with a 60&quot; x 12&quot; GREEN ECO ELECTRIC POWER emblazoned across the side.(In the same way I would never get a car that says &quot;UBER HEMI BIG WANG POWER&quot; either)
7) be reliable and comfortable to drive, with low cost of ownership at least comparable to a reliable petrol car.<p>I dont think any of that list is unreasonable, and I am glad that Tesla exists, they have done a great service to the electric car.",1430753845

I couldn&#x27;t reverse a string or write FizzBuzz and in fact part of the reason for that was that I was so sure that programming was a magical ability that I didn&#x27;t have because I compared myself to people who had been writing code since their childhoods, and this created nerves which made it hard to really think about solving these problems instead of feeling helpless when I didn&#x27;t immediately &#x27;know&#x27; their solutions.<p>I powered through that and ended up doing very well in my CS program at Northwestern, and now am a professional software developer that my peers consider to be a &#x27;rockstar&#x27; programmer, although I still contend that I am mediocre and there is always SO much more to learn. At my job I frequently mentor our college interns, and many of them when they come into the job would be laughed out of the room by &#x27;good&#x27; programmers, but after a little bit of mentoring and consistent daily practice on the job, in 2 months they emerge &#x27;rockstar&#x27; programmers themselves, and in reality they are still probably about average.<p>Most of the &#x27;bad&#x27; programmers many of us come into contact with are just farther behind on their journey to being great software developers, and may only be as bad as they are because of fear to ask questions and be judged by those who think there are only 2 types of programmers.",1430753553

Add preferential attachment to the equation (good engineers try to work with other good engineers / hire only top talent), and the U-curve starts to make sense IMHO.",1430753129

9486599,comment,9485526,9486323,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> Nil is a useful modelling tool, even in Rust where it exists via Option<>/None, correct?<p>It&#x27;s not that null is not useful. It&#x27;s that most pointers can never be null, so nullability is the wrong default. And it is useful for the compiler to force you to handle the case in which pointers are null.<p>> Perhaps by forcing you to be extremely explicit (and enforcing `match` always handles all conditions) you gain some arguable safety, but at what cost?<p>There&#x27;s basically no downside to having no null pointers. With constructs like Option::map the code is usually even less verbose than the equivalent code with null.<p>> It&#x27;s certainly not easier to use and reason about, IMO.<p>You never have to worry about your program failing whenever you type &quot;.&quot; or &quot;∗&quot;. With null, the semantics of the language are that an exception can be thrown [1] whenever those constructs are invoked. That&#x27;s pretty much <i>objectively</i> easier to reason about.<p>> It seems to me the design was chosen more as a way to ensure memory lifetime could be better predicted by the compiler rather than any strong argument for safety<p>Huh? Lifetimes are totally independent. We could have had null pointers with the lifetime system (and there were languages like Cyclone that had both). The system exists precisely because of safety.<p>We also get some really nice optimizations out of it that are impossible to get in C. All pointers in Rust are <i>dereferenceable</i> per the LLVM definition, which opens up some really neat optimizations like loop invariant code motion on loads.<p>> in my experience nil-deref errors are rarely a painful thing. They happen often, but are also fixed quickly.<p>Not in my experience. They show up in production all the time.<p>[1]: Or you could do what Nim does, and make dereferencing null undefined behavior instead of guaranteeing that an exception is thrown, but that strikes me as worse than what Java does.",1430752124

In doing so, she would show cost savings by layoffs of a certain chunk of employees. &quot;Cost synergies&quot; was the label. I think the expected number at the time was around 10k. <a href=""http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=230610"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=23061...</a><p>In the next 4 years, Fiorina would sell off the printing business (which had higher margins) and double-down on the PC business (with lower margins.) Timing as it was, the dot-com bubble burst which affected every hardware maker (since tech companies needed to buy hardware to operate.)<p>She basically made the absolute wrong bets, and as a result many jobs were destroyed. Between HP and Compaq, the collective companies lost more than $13 Billion in shareholder value. Other companies did at that time as well, but HP was by far the worst.<p>When tracing the history of HP performance during Fiorina&#x27;s tenure as CEO, she is arguably one of the worst who has ever guided a publicly-traded US company. A simple before-and-after of the company&#x27;s position from the day she took leadership until the day she left is not a pretty picture.",1430751693

At that point, the government subsidy expires for Tesla (100,000 cars shipped by one manu) and they make full profits on their own dime. If they were really unsustainable, nobody would be investing in TSLA right now.<p>The tax subsidy applies to all electric cars, and has made the Leaf and other cars in its class affordable for many Americans, which has pushed electric car adoption.<p>Even in the case of Tesla, there are plenty of people who couldn&#x27;t afford a Tesla if it weren&#x27;t for the $7,500 tax credit. It seems silly, but it&#x27;s a big chunk of money, and when you&#x27;re stretching your budget to afford a nice, eco-friendly and American-produced car, the extra subsidy really helps.<p>Tesla is opening the door for sustainable transit in the U.S., has pushed other car manufacturers to follow suit, and is creating a buttload of jobs with their domestic factory, the Gigafactory 1, their local service centers, and whatever comes next.<p>It is frustrating to see tax money thrown at corporations, but hey, Tesla didn&#x27;t take a multi-billion dollar bailout when they made poor business decisions and were going to cost America millions of jobs. Just something to put this in perspective.",1430751680

It is an invention of men as part of the larger social construcion of gender -- hence &quot;what beauty is for black women&quot; rather than black people in generally -- that is monetized more by make-up and fashion companies than by Hollywood. It&#x27;s a myth.<p>The recent liberal development of the sentiments &quot;everybody is beautiful&quot;, &quot;everybody defines their own beauty&quot; and the like is a naive attempt to mitigate a demonstrably deadly social poison by advocating that we spread it thin enough that it just becomes water. The actual solution is to identify that it is poison and abolish it.",1430751622

A 15K mile Leaf would typically have lost at most 5-10% of its original capacity (one &quot;pip&quot; on the health meter), and have  a 70-90 mile range. My daily driver is a 2012 Leaf -- over 3 years old and I can still get over 100 miles between charges. I paid about $12K for it, fully loaded SL trim.<p>Nissan&#x27;s battery comes with two warranties: an 8-year 100K mile warranty against defects, and a 5-year 60K mile warranty against capacity loss. Even a 2011 Leaf with 50K miles on it will have at least 70% of its original range, but most have much more. Batteries don&#x27;t degrade nearly as fast as you think they do.<p>Tesla put out information about the original Roadster battery health a while back. That&#x27;s a car that&#x27;s been on the road long enough that owners have put a lot of miles (and charge cycles) on them. They averaged only 15% capacity loss after 100,000 miles. That was with even older battery tech. A couple year old EV is not &quot;on its last legs&quot;.",1430751621

4509340,comment,4508614,4508809,1,0,lloeki,,,"From the homebrew FAQ (<a href=""https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/FAQ</a>)<p><pre><code>    Can I install my own stuff to /usr/local?

    Yes, brew is designed to not get in your way so you can
    use it how you like.

    Install your own stuff, but be aware that if you
    install common libraries, like libexpat yourself, it may
    cause trouble when trying to build certain Homebrew
    formula. As a result brew doctor will warn you about
    this.

    Thus its probably better to install your own stuff to
    the Cellar and then brew link it. Like so:

        $ cd foo-0.1
        $ brew diy
        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1
        [snip]
        $ make && make install
        $ brew link foo
        Linking /usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1... 17 symlinks created
</code></pre>
And really, writing your own formula is easy if manual steps are easy, and if they're hard, well, writing a formula makes you do it only once, since you'll be able to reuse the formula later.<p>Anyway brew builds in Cellar, and symlinks in /usr/local but never steps on what you would have installed manually.",1347429526

Whenever you see an equation of the form Ab = c and you want to find b, you should use a function equivalent to lu_solve (in the GNU Scientific Library) or the left-divide operator in Octave/Matlab (b = A\c), which will use the LU factorization algorithm [2] without ever computing A^(-1).<p>This is normally faster, more numerically stable and more space efficient. Even better, once you've computed the LU factorization of A once (which takes O(n^3) operations) you can then solve Ab = c for many different values of b and c in O(n^2) operations, by caching the factorization of A.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/01/19/dont-invert-that-matrix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/01/19/dont-invert-that-ma...</a>

Shaka for example had a small penis (actually historically accurate) and killed thousands of people because of it. The zulu empire was actually not the bad one as the Matabele under Mzilikali after his loss to the zulu, took his tribe and conducted a scorched earth campaign across the lower section of africa destroying all in his path.<p>Lets not forget the laughable Xhosa girl Nongqawuse who said she saw visions that if everybody killed off their cattle and burned their fields the dead spirits of their ancestors would grant not only tenfold cattle in return, but destruction of the new white Anglo/Boer civilization in the southern cape. Needless to say after they slaughtered and burned everything no ancestors were forthcoming and 25 thousand of the Xhosa tribe died.
The tribes of africa were largely barbaric and vicious groups of people who really only understood killing for the most part. There were exceptions to the rule as there always are, the hottentots, and various smaller tribes, but for the most part african culture was set up to destroy other cultures to begin with.<p>I'm not going to say that they are better off having been colonized by the europeans, but the alternative was pretty vicious as well.",1347429267

Surely they must give an insurer the volume of cars coming through, yes? What seemed unlikely to me is that the car wash must also show the types of cars getting washed. This would be something handled by the insurance company after making certain assumptions that factor into the risk.<p>Assuming that each car wash did pay damages (which as you mentioned they don't), do you think they would charge premiums for washing all luxury cars? The price to insure against damages seems like it should be fixed per car (even if based off volume). One month might be oversaturated with $30,000 cars and another month might have more $20,000 cars. Will the cost to insure the car wash against potential damages these months not be the same even when a higher saturation of more expensive cars incurs more risk for the insurer?<p>My answer to this forms my basis of why I didn't like the example, even artificially, which is that the price to insure every car <i>is</i> the same based on the likelihood of all cars getting damaged and the price to fix them (monthly insurance cost/amount of cars). The insurance cost has no respect to which cars go through the wash - probably because it's too much of a hassle for the insurer to police which cars are actually visiting and making a more accurate calculation of risk. Instead, they assume every wash has a certain amount of luxury cars - even if they don't. Obviously this wouldn't hurt margins if they accepted the cars that are covered but it doesn't stop them from raising margins, which they still might do.",1347428329

It's my ""bible"" now.  I knew <i>something</i> was completely and absolutely wrong with my self-destructive thought patterns but didn't understand <i>what</i> until I learned about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).<p>A sad observation:  everytime I encounter a struggling friend with dysfunctional thought patterns, I work through their thoughts using CBT techniques (without mentioning that's what I'm doing).  This almost always results in a calmer friend who starts feeling better about the situation, or at least more confident in their ability to deal with it.<p>I then tell them what I'd done to improve their emotional state and how they can learn to do it for themselves by pointing them to CBT and Burns... and a few months later I find they still suffer from dysfunctional thoughts and haven't bothered following my advice.<p>Funny thing is I was the same;  it took a bout of severe depression and reading ""Feeling Good"" exactly at the time when I could introspect my severely dysfunctional thought patterns for me to accept my situation (having purchased the book a year previously but being dubious about its claims of my ""mild"" depression at the time).  I don't know if this is social conditioning (only ""weak"" people get depression) or general ignorance of the fact that the mind needs ""maintenance work"".",1347427688

We need a solid technology plan to help spend this money effectively. I am thinking something related to tablets would likely offer the most bang per dollar, but don't have a good sense of what is out there specifically for the classroom. One limitation we have is we need flash support. Awesome apps the school already uses such as Dreambox use flash, so the ipad is likely not an option. I definitely like Class Dojo and plan to use that as one use case where a tablet in each classroom would make sense. I am hoping to help create a technology plan that maximizes value per dollar spent. We have a nice big surplus for a public school, but parents need to see it spent prudently if we expect them to be generous with their donations again this year. Do you have any recommendations? Do you have kids in a school that uses tablets in the classroom? Or know of good applications that make the teachers day easier given they have a tablet?<p>I have a Kindergartner and 2nd grader so am personally more biased towards those grades at the moment.

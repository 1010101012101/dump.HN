But almost all VCs have much more money than they know what to do with. They raise huge funds to rake in millions per year through management fees.<p>The problem is that traditional VCs can&#x27;t manage very many investments. So only a handful of series A VC deals can happen per year.<p>But there is a nearly infinite supply of money just waiting for another way to invest in startups that isn&#x27;t VC. Things like Kickstarter from the bottom up and AngelList from the top down are the harbingers of doom for most VCs.",1411865968

Note that this includes <i>everything</i>. Your personal SMS, tweets, what not as well. And that includes weekends and off hours too.

He&#x27;s one of the first if not the first person to suggest that what we think of as enlightenment is actually a biological event that the human body can perform given the right triggers, rather than simply a different state of mind or frame of thought.  This is a revolutionary idea if you think about it; talk about &quot;hacking the brain&quot;.  The great thing about him is he&#x27;s very relatable and not aloof, he kept his job as a government clerk and aside from selling a small handful of books, was clearly not interested in making money off his ideas.<p>He tried for years to raise interest in the scientific community to study the phenomenon, but of course grant money is hard to come by, and doubly hard if you&#x27;re doing anything remotely unconventional, so his research foundation never took off and he passed away in I think it was 1981.<p>A lot of people don&#x27;t know about him, but they&#x27;ve started putting his books on Kindle so you can go check them out.  All of them are extraordinary reads, although I&#x27;d start with his prose, and then move to his poetry if you&#x27;re interested in that.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Gopi-Krishna/e/B00IPU7XD4/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1411864845&sr=8-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Gopi-Krishna/e/B00IPU7XD4/ref=sr_ntt_s...</a>",1411864975

It spawns a mass of interfaces, the vast majority of which have only one implementation. So you are usually adding a layer of abstraction without accomplishing anything.<p>The approach I favor is to identify seams and abstraction boundaries at a higher level, corresponding to larger units of functionality. Then carefully define interfaces between these larger units, and build mocks for them for testability. But having defined interfaces for every class, or even close to every class, is overkill.",1411863859

It is a pet peeve of mine that there are people who are so rabidly anti-sugar (the foaming at the mouth types).

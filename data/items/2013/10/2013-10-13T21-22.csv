If a person thinks that its a gendered term, then that person is an idiot because there are lots of male and trans-gender prostitutes. That being said He&#x27;s both wrong and hypocritical for accusing her of being a sell-out, especially when you consider he wanted her content for the sole purpose of making money off of it. She should be entitled to make money off of her work, especially when another entity is going to be.<p>He most likely called her an &quot;Urban Whore,&quot; as a play on words using the title of her site. He probably thought it was clever, but as we already established, he&#x27;s an asshole. Assholes often exhibit poor judgement. Yet when an African American woman (or anyone else) calls herself an Urban Scientist, she loses the right to be genuinely offended by the use of the term Urban. I didn&#x27;t see her state that she was offended by the word, but nobody else really needs to be offended by it on her behalf. Instead, focus on the fact that this guy&#x27;s an asshole for calling a person a whore for not giving him free content so he could make money.<p>There&#x27;s a potential that he meant to be both sexist and racist, but there isn&#x27;t really any way to know for sure. That&#x27;s why its stupid to suggest that he was either of those things.<p>Does it really matter that an asshole is accurately classified? Not really, but if we are going to talk about something, we might as well be accurate about it.",1381701331

Multiple ballistic reentries, multiple engine failures, multiple docking issues, multiple failures of the braking rockets on landing.  Cosmonauts have suffered bruises, broken teeth, broken ribs -- one crewmember on Soyuz 18a was so badly injured that he never flew in space again.<p>But Soyuz was an inherently robust design.  It is designed to be survivable, to have backups to backups.  You may not enjoy the experience, but the Soyuz will try its best to bring you back to earth alive.<p>For example, there have been <i>three</i> separation failures during reentry, most recently in 2008.  This is an extremely harrowing event, because the unseparated spacecraft assumes a head-first orientation, unprotected by the heat shield.  However, the Soyuz is robustly built, and in all three cases the reentry module survived long enough for the connection to the orbital module to burn free.  Once that happened, the mass distribution of the reentry module automatically rotated it to face heat-shield forward.<p>Those three separation failures could&#x27;ve killed 8 cosmonauts.  Instead, they killed no cosmonauts.  Because the Soyuz could tolerate this particular failure mode.",1381701150

On AIO, you&#x27;re still better off on AT&T over the course of a 2 year contract by $90.  If you choose StraightTalk, you&#x27;ll save $174 over 2 years.  (That savings goes up to $299 if you buy an AT&T phone and then immediately cancel and pay the ETF; both prices combined are less than the $749 sticker price.)<p>The trick is that most people don&#x27;t replace their phones on a schedule.  Some phones don&#x27;t hold enough of a charge after 18 months and get replaced early; some people are still happy with their 4 year old phone.  If you are on a pay-as-you-go plan and hold onto a phone for longer than 2 years, the savings start to really add up.<p>The other trick is that many people can get pay-as-you-go prices on contract, through their corporation, credit union, or university.

A lot of people use that as the name of loop variables, and it means breaking habit or wasting time changing the name.<p>2. For test 3, try some multiple-extension files to make sure they did it right (some.file.multiple.extensions, should return &quot;extensions&quot;)<p>3. For test 5, it says &quot;integers&quot;. Try some non-integers during testing, to make sure that it&#x27;s only checking for integers.<p>4. For test 5, it says &quot;arrays&quot;.

That said, I hear there are many areas in the US where t-mobile provides decent service.  For people considering switching if t-mobile&#x27;s international data deal isn&#x27;t that important to you, you may want to check out <a href=""http://www.solavei.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solavei.com</a> first.   They are a t-mobile reseller (MVNO) and you may be able to save some money compared to going through t-mobile directly.  Their prices are similar to straight talk (mentioned in some of the other comments) and they also allow you to refer customers to reduce your monthly bill.<p>Best cell phone service for the price IMO is <a href=""http://www.pagepluscellular.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pagepluscellular.com/</a> (a verizon reseller).  $55 / month (including taxes and fees) for unlimited calling, unlimited texts, and 2 gigs of data.   I have been a customer of theirs for a year and a half.  Their customer service is pretty good, but more importantly their signal strength (coming from verizon&#x27;s towers) is the best out of all the carriers in NYC.<p>The one big caveat with the MVNO resellers is that they don&#x27;t offer LTE data and some don&#x27;t support LTE phones (ie iphone 5, 5c, 5s, etc).<p>TL;DR  - if you&#x27;re down to use an iPhone 4S or other 3G smartphone you can save some serious money per month going through an MVNO reseller.",1381698024

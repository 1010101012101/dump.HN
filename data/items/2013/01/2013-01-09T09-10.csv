5030847,comment,5028044,5030756,2,0,tluyben2,,,"And why is that? Where I live most of the year, on a mountain in nature, I see young people moving away all the time and their parents and grandparents wanting 'something better' for them. What is that something better? If you ask them, they all, without fail, come with examples from American tv shows on how they want to live or how they want their offspring to live. Nice suits, phones, cars, houses, etc. Why do people living of fantastic fresh fish, veg, olive(s) oil, cheese and people who saw their parents/grandparents walk up the mountain every day to get groceries or work the land so desperately want to grow incredibly fat on Burger King and have as highest goal to 'not do anything every again'?<p>I know they want this because they see it in tv shows because they tell me; it's considered 'being rich' to act and look like that. People who are complaining all the time to us that they cannot possibly pay the next month rent have huge flatscreens and DID buy <i>another</i> game console or phone with christmas. I don't know about the Philipines or China, but this is southern europe and it's very real.

But to think that 2 SUVs, a huge house (what's on the top floor again? yeah no-one goes there ever) or two, almost certainly living on debt (it's one of those things designed to buy perceived happiness in exchange for money for the MAN) will make you happy is a delusion which <i>is</i> set forth by the media.

5030841,comment,5028939,5028939,6,0,saurik,,,"> Why do people, invited for a dinner party at 7.30, think its cool to arrive at 8.30? Its rude. Its inconsiderate. And its selfish...<p>Some people here are saying that dinners are different than parties: that you really do need to be on time. I also tended to believe that. Especially, one would imagine, for ""particularly special dinner occasions"" such as organized holiday events. Hence, when I was invited to Thankgiving dinner this year, and was tasked with bringing the stuffing, I considered it horrible of me that I was arriving ten minutes late--due to my oven's starter stopping working halfway through my preparations I had to find a candle-lighter, delaying some of my cooking preparations--and sending notices to the other people by SMS.<p>However, when I got there, no one was there but the host, and he was nowhere near done cooking anything. No one else arrived for a half hour, and that was just one person. Most people didn't arrive until a couple hours later, and some people didn't arrive until a few hours later. If anything, the host was concerned that he had confused me into taking the time of the event too literally.<p>It isn't like there was a bunch of time wasted: we were having a get-together... the goal is to spend time with a bunch of people and have fun, and everyone's schedules are going to be somewhat different from each others. It isn't actually critical that everyone eats at the exact same moment, and it certainly isn't important that everyone hears every moment of every single conversation.<p>I thereby want to say that this is more of a culture thing than anything else. Here's one way to tell: when that person who was late tries to make a plan with <i>you</i>, come late next time and see if they get angry. Frankly, I bet they don't, and that they don't even seem at all phased: they ended up doing something else to keep the time passing, and weren't even closely paying attention to when you would arrive. Yet, I bet you will still be angry; in fact, I further bet you will even be angry that the other person <i>isn't</i> angry ;P.<p>Yes: to you this is really important. Maybe for the kind of event you want to have it actually <i>is</i> important (carefully prepared food will be ruined if people didn't eat it at the right moment, you are putting on a play and you actually need the actors to be there, etc.). However, that doesn't mean it is important in all circumstances or that even in the same circumstance it is considered important to all people.<p>It doesn't even mean that that kind of event is optimal, or that everyone else wants to have that kind of event. If it is actually important to you, be prepared to defend why it is important, be prepared to only be able to make that case occasionally, and keep an open mind to compromising with others who do not share your opinion that every event is better if everyone arrives at exactly the same moment.<p>A term that is sometimes used for this phenomenon is ""cultural cross-talk"", and a classic example is how long you wait before someone else is done talking before it is no longer considered you ""butting in"" when you start to speak. Different people from different backgrounds and different cultures have different expectations of how this should work, and if you aren't aware of this you end up getting really angry.<p>As a concrete example, the way this would apparently work in American Indian societies would involve very long silences: just because no one is now talking it is not to be assumed that the person who was speaking before isn't just collecting their thoughts to continue to speak again. To presume otherwise would be very rude, and it isn't like you need to be in a rush: you thereby should continue to wait until it is clear that the other person has ceded the floor.<p>On the other hand, in some places (I believe New York is the typical example; I'm from Chicago, however, and also have this tendency) you see a <i>negative</i> amount of time before the other person is supposed to start talking: yes, people seriously are predicting in their minds what the other person is saying so when it seems like they are coming to the end of a thought they can start speaking <i>while</i> that other person is still talking.<p>Both of these are normal and neither are ""rude"": they are just cultural expectation. However, one can <i>easily</i> imagine people from a culture expecting patience and clear turn order to write a massive rant claiming that ""no, you are not 'anticipating my sentence final intonation'; you are rude and selfish"", making the argument that the other person ""isn't listening to me and just wants to hear themselves speak... they even talk over what I'm saying, and I can't get a word in edgewise"".<p>But no, it really is just a difference in expectation. You see these same differences in situations like whether it is rude to ask for things, whether it is rude to deny people asking for things, whether it is rude to presume you can share something, whether it is rude to look at someone, whether it is rude to talk to someone, and whether it is rude to make any form of physical contact at all with someone (or even to stand close enough to someone that physical contact could be possible). People are simply different: that doesn't make them ""rude"".",1357723951

It gives you a feeling of satisfaction, that you've taken a chance which could really change your life.<p>The problem is that it won't and that the satisfaction will relax you and reduce the probability of taking real action to improve your life. If you want life changes then you must <i>reduce</i>, not increase comfort. Make yourself as uncomfortable as possible and you will have a real reason to go out there and do what you need to. Gamble, drink, socialise or dream your life away and you will be stuck in a rut.<p>The point is that we must shape our lives such that rewards come from actions which are beneficial in the true sense.

Many applications benefit from user location data, but lo- cation data raises privacy concerns. Anonymization can protect privacy, but identities can sometimes be inferred from supposedly anonymous data. This paper studies a new attack on the anonymity of location data. We show that if the approximate locations of an individuals home and workplace can both be deduced from a location trace, then <i>the median size of the individuals anonymity set in the U.S. working population is 1, 21 and 34,980, for locations known at the granularity of a census block, census track and county respectively.</i> The location data of people who live and work in different regions can be re-identified even more easily. Our results show that the threat of re-identification for location data is much greater when the individuals home and work locations can both be deduced from the data. To preserve anonymity, we offer guidance for obfuscating location traces before they are disclosed.<p><a href=""http://xenon.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/commute.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xenon.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/commute.pdf</a>",1357722850

I'm not saying that including code you don't want to use isn't going to shave of milliseconds, I'm just not convinced that the problem is being adequately identified. The problem honestly sounds like the codebase itself.

5030801,comment,5029594,5029594,14,0,buro9,,,"Let me propose a maturity scale and suggest where things are...<p><i>Level 1) Are you recording metrics?</i><p>That's the first basic level of maturity, without recording data you cannot have data from which to support any decisions. Without data you are blind. The assumption here is that you are able to record everything that you need to... recording 3 metrics isn't enough, you need to be able to get to all your data and record it over time.<p><i>Level 2) Are you able to visualise your raw data?</i><p>This is the basic dashboard. Whether you build something pretty or use an existing software package it's just the ability to see the data that you are collecting. This relies on people to figure out the inter-connectedness of data and to make inferences from it. Basic graphs and trend analysis fit in here.<p><i>Level 3) Are you able to visualise insights in your data?</i><p>This is about changing your dashboard or reports such that you can start to consider metrics that are abstractions from the raw data but important to you. Think of cohort charts, revenue relationships to user behaviour, UX funnels, engagement charts, etc.<p><i>Level 4) Are you able to record exceptions in your reporting?</i><p>As in, can you create thresholds against a metric such that if the metric goes above or below the threshold an event is triggered to record it. Exception tracking coupled with the insights in level 3 should give you the ability to do things like release a new feature and see the resulting effect on certain metrics and be alerted when those effects are outside of some normal range.<p><i>Level 5) Are you able to visualise your exceptional events?</i><p>And here we are at the newsfeed of data, the events which stand-out are highlighted and all of the other noise drops away. This is great for producing a list of things you might want to know or react to... but you can't get here without going through (and still having) levels 1-4 and it's important to understand that different people in your organisation still need all those prior levels (try telling your sysadmin that he can't have log files or munin and that instead he's got a news feed).",1357722757

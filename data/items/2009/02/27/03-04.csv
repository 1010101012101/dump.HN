David Filo, Jerry Yang, Sergey Brin, Larry Page didn't bother to finish grad school at Stanford and dropped out too. On the other hand, we can think of Craig Venter, Andrew Grove, Gordon Moore, Carver Mead... all of whom obtained PhD's.<p>The usefulness of a degree depends on what field one is working on. In the Software arena, smart kids out of high school can do a lot if college is not holding them back. But try to start a laser / semiconductor / biotech company with high school kids if you dare ;-)<p>One might not need a degree to be a good software entrepreneur, but there are many other entrepreneurs who don't live in the software world. Sure, HN is focused on software, but it seems to me that it's irresponsible to promote the idea that all that entrepreneurs need is passion and hard-work. Necessary but not sufficient.",1235707122

If your goal really is to possibly move towards entrepreneurial things then .. its good to see, and start your career off with the right understanding of how you should train in the arts of being a software jedi.  Long hours, rigorous reading, training.  Wearing every single hat possible, and grabbing every opportunity.  When your ready to move on (if you do), then the big company will still be there.

I use a lot of addons to manage this and to make my firefox usage more efficient:  Aging tabs, sxipper, fire gesture, foxmarks, next tab, a few other minor addons that give minor productivity boosts and a whole suite of web dev/design tools on top of that.(checkbox mate is pretty nice if you haven't seen it)  I'm about to try out tabkit and fisheye tabs to see if they help me at all.  But the addon that I really want and need doesn't seem to exist.<p>I work on a laptop, a work computer and a home computer.  When I switch computers I frequently need to open the 20+ tabs that were open on the other computer.  I have been passing around a text document full of URLs with dropbox but that is an awful and time consuming solution.  Not to mention I lose sessions/cookies when I transfer over(though that would be a much more difficult addon from a developer perspective then what I am looking for).  What I want is basically a foxmarks for my open tabs, and as far as I can tell this doesn't exist at all.  I just grabbed Send Tab URL's, which will make my life slightly easier, but it is not truly what I am looking for.<p>I would definitely be willing to pay for such an addon, though I have never really heard of addons costing money.

496783,comment,495053,495709,0,0,gms,,,"""Despite all the time I have wasted here....it was worth it""<p>This sentiment is very common here, but I strongly question it. I also wonder why people don't label their time here a little more honestly: as procrastination. We all justify it as ""oh, but I might learn something useful for my future"". And some of us might have indeed tangibly improved their lives (though I'm sceptical). But surely whatever benefits you gain can be reaped by visiting say once every 3-4 days, vs 12 times in one day? More generally, out of the people who do claim to have benefited their lives, are they able to point to a specific instance or two where HN tangibly improved their lot?<p>I'll be honest: I resent visiting here often. I'm a worse person for it. Every minute I (or you, for that matter) spend here, someone else is spending that minute doing great work (for some definition of 'great'). In fact I am suspicious of anyone who has a ginormous amount of comments posted frequently; I do not see it as something to be proud of, but quite the opposite.<p>I'm sure there are people who buck the trend (pg seems to frequently post here, yet still manages to do great work. I am convinced that he has cloned himself without telling anyone).<p>I realise that what I'm saying might be heresy (see 'What You Can't Say' etc) given the constant optimism among this site's visitors, but I do not mean to denigrate anyone when I say that most of us (me included of course) are timewasters.",1235704547

First, the conventional path is boring and I needed to jump off.<p>Second, the amount of work required to be great at something completely trumps the tiny amount of work that you're going to put in during college.

Those numbers you're basing that advice on have a built-in skew towards people who have chosen to use credit cards.  You have to ask the question ""Would a person who would accept the advice to not get a credit card behave in the same way as the average credit card user if they did have one?""<p>I would argue that if you're seeking and open to advice on whether or how to use a credit card, you're probably already differentiated from the free-wheeling credit-abusing mob, and that if that's the case, if you know you can be responsible with it, it's actually a really great idea to have one.",1235703600

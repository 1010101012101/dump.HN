I would rewrite the whole thing in either Backbone or some variation on the react/flux approach in, at most, two days, and be able to get the in-house developer up to speed in another one to two days if they were capable and, perhaps more importantly, willing and remotely curious.<p>In part this has been due to the current speed of development in browser technologies and frameworks/libraries, and in part it&#x27;s just part of working with in-house developers who have no love for their job or have other things that they prioritize (35+ with kids, understandable!).<p>Usually this level of horror only presented itself in older, more established companies with &#x27;legacy devs&#x27;, but I&#x27;ve seen similar issues with (web) startups that hired without knowledge of the domain.<p>So, to be clear: getting the job done is the priority. I&#x27;ve worked on Backbone projects where I would&#x27;ve loved to use the latest and greatest, but happily worked with stuff that I would consider, in front-end-hacker-news-hipster terms, old-fashioned. And I&#x27;ve come to realize that if you have clever developers with curiosity, you can get a &#x27;front-end app&#x27; done that isn&#x27;t pretty, but works well. But too often, especially in the &#x27;cheaper&#x27; startups with little founder-level technical know-how of the domain (front-end), I&#x27;ve seen things go very, very wrong.",1424026774

I don&#x27;t mean founders here, but freelancers, consultants, bootstrappers etc. They really are paid by the amount of value they produce, or as close to it as we can determine via the market. Success as a freelancer depends on being able to produce a large amount of value and being able to capture as much of it as possible. There&#x27;s an incredible range here, from getting $0.03 to do human-OCR on Mechanical Turk to Hillary-Clinton-style $300,000 speaking engagements. It&#x27;s highly variable over time as well. Freelancers are constantly looking for new clients, and badgering existing clients to actually pay them. They also have to be prepared to have dry-spells where they&#x27;re not earning at all. In other words, it&#x27;s risky.<p>Given that backdrop, the value that employers offer to employees is reduction of risk. Employees are not exposed to the downside risks of the market, nor do they participate in the upside when the business does well. Employees do risk losing their job, but that risk is generally pretty low.<p>Startups, though, offer less risk reduction than more established companies. Some of this is intentional, to align incentives and select for employees comfortable with the big-risk-big-reward reality of a startup. Some of it comes from the inherent instability of startups. Chances that a startup employee will abruptly lose her job, or not get paid for work already done is much higher employees of established companies. Even the &quot;big reward&quot; scenarios tend toward instability—for example, &quot;Good news, we being acquired by Google! Now we all have to move to Mountain View.&quot;<p>Because of this, evaluating a job offer from a startup has to involve an assessment of the risk it involves. A portion of compensation is usually equity, and that equity is of completely unknown value, compared to say, RSUs as Facebook. The job being offered is inherently temporary, since the company will either fail, be acquired or transform into a completely different company within a few years. It&#x27;s less risk than freelancing, but much more risk than working at a big company.",1424026203

No, it means something very close to &quot;apply&quot; or &quot;concat&quot;, depending on the usage. That example is the same as:<p><pre><code>  f.apply(this, [1,2,3])

But it&#x27;s cleaner syntax. The interesting part is that you can mix them in anywhere:<p><pre><code>  function f(x, y, z) {

  a = [1,2];
  b = [3];

  [...a, ...b] == [].concat(a,b) == [1,2,3]

Recent grads aren&#x27;t usually as effective as people with experience, and salaries tend to reflect that. I can see many reasons why a founder might be interested in hiring someone with little to no experience, but the job postings didn&#x27;t specifically say &quot;junior&quot; in them.<p>- I see many comments referencing the realities of what is affordable. Yet some of these startups are advertising more than one job opening. Therefore, it would appear they are considering hiring three people instead of one person for 3x the salary. My question is informed by real world experience and written material: advice, essays and quotes including obvious and much repeated ones by Paul Graham, Peter Thiel, and Bill Gates which emphasize the concept that great employees are magnitudes more effective than good ones. Every knowledge-industry employer I&#x27;ve talked to agrees. Much startup advice emphasizes how bad it is to grow your team too quickly, and how a low performing employee hurts far more than a high performing employee helps. Given some of the companies are hiring for multiple positions, this could imply the salaries are considered competitive, and paying more wouldn&#x27;t get a better employee.",1424025246

The idea that every task involves some groundbreaking research into an entirely novel field is ridiculous. We often know a great deal about what it is we&#x27;re about to do. Yesterday I needed to fix some chef recipes to get some monitoring working on a different OS, I could give a fairly decent estimate about how long that would take and it had some uncertainty in it. I built a simple site with stripe integration and had a good idea about how long it would take. I know more about doing that next time, too and have a better idea about how long it will take.<p>> We may be able to apply past experience inventing similar things to our estimations, but there is always some amount of uncertainty.<p>Having uncertainty in an estimate does not make the estimate pointless. Even having a lower bound can be enough. If I know a feature will not be done in under a week (because similar ones take two weeks, and this has a few extra complexities so my base assumption should be &quot;longer than two weeks&quot;) then that might be enough for someone to not choose to implement it. I&#x27;ve had that before on projects, where I&#x27;ve given a minimum time and the feature has been dropped.<p>> If I don&#x27;t know what a car is, asking me how long it will take to invent one so that you could use it to get to the train is inviting trouble.<p>But if someone said &quot;Invent a car for me, I need to get to the station tomorrow&quot; you could easily say that it&#x27;s not going to happen within a day, and that information would still be useful.",1424025050

Excerpt below.<p>So perhaps Baumeister&#x27;s essay wouldn&#x27;t be a revelation to some feminists. But is Baumeister wrong? Perhaps I am missing the difference. The main difference seems to be the feminist take is more normative.<p>--------<p><a href=""http://denisdutton.com/baumeister.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://denisdutton.com/baumeister.htm</a><p>&quot; The phrase “Be a man” is not as common as it once was, but there is still some sense that manhood must be earned. Every adult female is a woman and is entitled to respect as such, but many cultures withhold respect from the males until and unless the lads prove themselves. This is of course tremendously useful for the culture, because it can set the terms by which males earn respect as men, and in that way it can motivate the men to do things that the culture finds productive.<p>Some sociological writings about the male role have emphasized that to be a man, you have to produce more than you consume. That is, men are expected, first, to provide for themselves: If somebody else provides for you, you’re less than a man. Second, the man should create some additional wealth or surplus value so that it can provide for others in addition to himself. These can be his wife and children, or others who depend on him, or his subordinates, or even perhaps just paying taxes that the government can use. Regardless, you’re not a man unless you produce at that level.<p>Again, I’m not saying men have it worse than women. There are plenty of problems and disadvantages that cultures put on women. My point is just that cultures find men useful in these very specific ways. Requiring the man to earn respect by producing wealth and value that can support himself and others is one of these.

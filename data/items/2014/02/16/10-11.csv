Still you really can&#x27;t walk everywhere as easily as in a big european city.<p>My advice for people going to Thailand would be to go to the north, small towns like Mae Hong Son are amazing places. Rent a motorbike and drive around the mountain villages. It&#x27;s much cheaper than in the south and people are way more friendlier.<p>The other option is to go to the southern islands. Koh Samui is the most expensive place, made for couples and families. Koh Phangan is the party island where you can buy some marijuana and end up spending 20 years in a Thai jail. There&#x27;s some nice hidden places in that island with less drug tourism. Most of the locals really despise tourists though and I can really understand that. Koh Tao is the diver&#x27;s island, but my friend who was there when we were in Phangan told us, that it&#x27;s getting more touristy and turning into another Phangan with young and recless party people. The best islands I visited were in the Andaman sea. Koh Lanta, Koh Ngai...

I have an XP running in VirtualBox for testing, so I just tried what you wrote - that was fun! :)\nI have no idea what I just did, just that it felt good, to make that impact on the screen with that little code, knowing it was done directly ;)<p>I will have to set some time off to understand it (better)!<p>Re. progress, I just have this feeling, that we are just doing the same, over and over again - then creating another language to do the same over and over again.\nIn electronics we have components that does 1 thing, usually with different values. In the worst case, we take a standard component and program it.<p>I would really like to have a process, where I can architect a system and the data flow and finally code a couple of non-standard functions/classes/methods/whatever and be done :)<p>Good or bad, Apple is trying to do it in Xcode and several IDEs, give you a glimpse of this. Maybe they just create your HTML for you, but that&#x27;s a step in the right direction.\nOf course it would be best to be able to re-use your own code, for the &quot;automated&quot; parts, instead of relying on someone else&#x27;s idea of what HTML and other code should look like.\nThese guys are trying to do it for Node.js: <a href=""http://noflojs.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://noflojs.org</a>\nI think it looks really promising. It would be great to be able to concentrate on solution specific code, rather than &quot;everything&quot;.<p>Re. Go, it is my one big regret, I chose Node.js over Go, a couple of years ago.\nI didn&#x27;t have the time to understand enough of both languages, so the choice was Node.js, due to the fact &quot;it&#x27;s javascript&quot; and that it seem good, when I did some prototypes.<p>The reality is, you client-side developer, should probably never touch your server-side code! It is far from the same. Same syntax, same way of creating classes, less scope problems, there is only 1 environment, so you can remove some code.\nBut from there, it&#x27;s totally different! Which of course should make sense, since it is two completely different purposes.<p>Currently we are maintaining our code in a way (APIs), that ensures we can change either side without problems. So they future will probably be Go, as that seems like the best fit for multi-platform (BSD/*NIX) web-service development.<p>I ran into Qt years ago, when I was trying to get away from Java for a desktop app. I actually ended up with Python and Qt :)\nIt was really a much horrible experience, than I would have thought! :)\nQt just worked as supposed, with it&#x27;s limitations (at that time at least), which wasn&#x27;t to big of a problem.\nHave you tried on Mac?..... :)",1392546865

7247253,comment,7246746,7247019,9,0,depoll,,,"I think you&#x27;ve got the right idea, but you&#x27;ve overgeneralized the critique of subclassing by suggesting that it is contradictory.<p>Here&#x27;s where you&#x27;re 100% correct: a subclass should not change the specified behavior of its superclass.  To do so would be a violation of the contract established by its superclass&#x27;s API.<p>This does not, however, apply to all use of subclassing.  Rather, a superclass&#x27;s API can be specified in such a way that subclasses may change behavior without breaking the contract.  Dog and Animal fit this mold -- the Animal API may specify that Speak() will &quot;cause the animal to speak&quot;, intentionally leaving this behavior up to subclassers.  This is core to how subtyping-based polymorphism works -- the superclass underconstrains its API in order to allow subclasses to later tighten those constraints while still providing valid implementations of the superclass&#x27;s contract.<p>Good API design requires that interface behaviors are properly constrained.  Overconstrain them, and you box yourself (and consumers of the API) out of useful abstractions.  Underconstrain them and it becomes impossible to work with the APIs because consumers of the API can&#x27;t count on subclasses to have the proper behavior.<p>It&#x27;s very, very easy to accidentally underconstrain an API, as you aptly pointed out.  UIView does this with its subviews array.  By exposing this mutable list, it broadcasts to its consumers a huge set of APIs that make promises they can&#x27;t keep.  If more thought had been put into how UIViews should be subclassed, they might have further constrained it so that (for example) a UIView is responsible for maintaining and keeping internally consistent its set of subviews.  This is a promise that subclasses can keep (probably by not publicly exposing subviews at all, since making it public is likely to, again, result in underconstrained APIs and more API promises it can&#x27;t keep), and assumptions that are useful for consumers of the API (e.g. &quot;I don&#x27;t have to worry about managing subviews that aren&#x27;t explicitly called out in the contract&quot; or &quot;a layout container can&#x27;t accidentally mess up its contents&#x27; subviews&quot;).<p>FWIW, XAML&#x27;s UI framework does draw these types of distinctions, making _most_ of its subtyping sane (take a look at UIElement, FrameworkElement, Control, ContentControl, and Panel).  Every now and then you can find examples where the abstractions are leaky due to under/overconstraining the APIs (e.g. the subtle differences between UserControl and ContentControl... UserControl looks like you could use it instead of ContentControl in most cases because the Content property is publicly settable and probably shouldn&#x27;t be -- an API decision that every UserControl subclass has to live with and usually chooses to ignore).<p>Anyway, my point is this: subclassing is _not_, at its core, contradictory.  But API designers _must_ design classes to be subclassed.  In order to properly answer the &quot;is X a Y?&quot; question, subclassers must also be able to assert that X&#x27;s implementation meets all of the constraints of Y&#x27;s API.",1392546664

A diamond, on the contrary, has scarcely any use-value; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.&quot; See <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>, Book I, Chapter IV,\n&quot;Of the Origin and Use of Money,&quot; Paragraph 13.<p>Like water, books may have a high use-value, but a very low exchange-value. Ditto for free open-source software.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that the dominant school of economics today--Neoclassical economics--equates the value of a commodity with its price, whether the market is competitive or not.<p>By contrast, Classical economists like Adam Smith distinguished between (1) value, (2) use-value, (3) exchange value, and (4) price. Prices are further distinguished between natural prices and market prices--<p>(1) Value: The amount of labor necessary to the production of a marketable commodity.<p>(2) Use-value is the amount of discomfort or labor saved through the use of an object. Use-value does not depend on the existence of a market.<p>(3) Exchange-value: What quantity of other commodities an object will exchange for, if traded. It does not need to be expressed in money prices.<p>(4) Money prices: There&#x27;s a distinction between &quot;natural prices&quot; (long-run cost-of-production) and &quot;market prices&quot; (price you actually pay for an object in the market); and these are only equal under conditions of market efficiency, equilibrium, and rational expectations.

7247217,comment,7246746,7247122,7,0,tolmasky,,,"I knew that sentence would require a much longer and deeper discussion (and I was hoping not to leave OOP to explain it). But in a nutshell, to me interfaces are meant precisely to represent &quot;unknown behavior&quot; and classes for &quot;known behavior&quot;.<p>If we take a second to temporarily forget classes altogether and look at functional programming, you may have something like map(). map() takes a list (well known construct) and an iterator function (unknown outside behavior). The API itself makes it clear what can be changed and what can&#x27;t. The scope of what is dynamic about the function and what isn&#x27;t is immediately obvious from the types themselves, completely transparent.<p>To me, interfaces serve this same role in non-functional programming: they represent outside and dynamic behavior. Classes on the other hand represent known behavior. The problem with &quot;good default implementations&quot; is that they mix these two (opposite) concepts together, which regularly leads to completely &quot;consistent&quot; but absurd outcomes, that are usually attempted to be fixed with language-bandaids. Let me provide two examples.<p>The first is NSArray and NSMutableArray in Cocoa/Cocoa Touch (apologies for the use of these, it is my strongest background, and ironically enough, one of the closest &quot;correct&quot; subclassing examples in my opinion). NSMutableArray is a subclass of NSArray. This makes no sense. Granted, it makes complete sense from an &quot;implementation&quot; view, but when it comes to user code it makes the classes meaningless: if I make a method that takes an NSArray, the whole point is I&#x27;m saying its immutable. But I can pass in a mutable array and none of my expectations will be valid: the array could change right under me. And yet the compiler will be perfectly happy because it is a correct statement, NSMutableArrays <i>are</i> NSArrays. This should theoretically be an edge case:  using a subclass to provide the OPPOSITE behavior of the original superclass, rendering the type-system absurd, and yet it is a widely used construct. I am thus forced to defensively copy the immutable array because it may very well be a mutable -- something completely &quot;consistent&quot; in this world. This to me shows this fundamental confusion of interface vs. classes. To get back to what you were saying, the problem with subclassing is precisely that it is incredibly difficult to state what is done &quot;legally&quot;.<p>If you have a pure interface, with no existing &quot;default&quot; behavior, its just like a lambda: anything goes. If you have a class, its static. If you have both (subclassing), it gets incredibly tricky and hard to predict the interaction. The entire API of the class becomes surface area for mutation.<p>Now let me give you the second example: UIView. UIView has a -subviews method. Why can&#x27;t I override -subviews to return a static list of views if I never want it to change (thus rendering addSubview: and removeSubview null)? The documentation does NOT list this method as non-overridable (And many people in fact override it to do perfectly legitimate things btw). And if I do override it, I still abide by all the postconditions of the method as defined by the API. And in fact, OTHER parts of the framework totally allow (And sometimes encourage!) this type of &quot;override instead of setting&quot;-style programming. As a novice using the framework, its a completely logical expectation that this should work. So why does UIKit completely break down?<p>Because the real postconditions are incredibly more complicated than just &quot;Return your subviews&quot;. You have part of the code written as if nothing will ever change (internally UIView relies on the _subviews ivar), but another that acts like an interface advertising that it might change (possible UIView subclasses). And half the time, the changes don&#x27;t upset any delicate balance. But other times, it does. Things like a final keyword wouldn&#x27;t fix the above problem because again, sometimes its legitimate to override. You can absolutely start writing your code in such a way where things &quot;should&quot; work no matter what method a subclass overrides, but that is very hard to get right (and very hard to test), whereas you get this for free by just forcing everyone to use the external interface! (This is what is meant by breaking encapsulation: you work so hard to provide a sane API, that then anyone can break by changing in otherwise completely legitimate ways). The real problem is that you are saying two contradictory things. What you actually want is to do ONE of the following:<p>1. Force everyone to use addSubview: and removeSubview: since its a concrete class in a hypothetical non-subclassable Objective-C world. No absurd results because, again, everyone is using the API you worked so hard on and properly tested (i.e. there is no way to futz around with -subviews) OR<p>2. Have -subviews be a method of some sort of Drawable interface, such that every other piece of code is now known to work with the expectation that it calls that instead of some internal ivar or something, allowing all the shenanigans you want.<p>Hopefully that makes my views a little clearer, but I&#x27;m super tired since its 2AM here so perhaps some of this was more verbose or not as clear as it could be.",1392545819

The more I use Node.js, the more I miss C++ or wish I&#x27;d chosen to try Go instead.\nI am REALLY not saying Node.js sucks or anything, I am just saying, the way scope and asynchronicity is handled, really doesn&#x27;t fit my brain well.<p>It is manageable on the client, where you don&#x27;t have to handle more than 1 session. You only have to think about events, callbacks, scope, etc. for 1 single person.\nTake that to the server and all hell breaks loose. You take what I have just mentioned, add thousands of connections and the fact that you do not get a fresh state (page refresh on the client), till you stop and start the Node.js server.\nIn all of that, you have to be really careful about security and permissions.\n(For all fairness, I should mention we use websockets and build our site as a couple of single page apps.)<p>It is of course solveable. I personally think, we have found a nice way of never retrieving data from data sources without having valid credentials on the user requesting the data. But I have handled easier solutions than this.<p>Sorry... That became a rant! :)",1392545226

Sure, Bootstrap has a lot of best practices you can copy / paste, but so do tons of other boilerplate projects on GitHub.<p>I also don&#x27;t see why people need to use grids. Grids are meant for graphic design (ie. <a href=""http://subtraction.com/pics/0703/grids_are_good.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subtraction.com/pics/0703/grids_are_good.pdf</a>) and architecture, not CSS.

5918342,comment,5918242,5918242,6,0,Ovid,,,"Right now, non-US based cloud services are using the PATRIOT Act as a way of selling themselves (<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/12/patriot-act-and-privacy-laws-take-a-bite-out-of-us-cloud-business/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/12/patriot-act-and-p...</a>). As an example from that article:<p><i>BAE Systems had ditched Microsoft Office 365 over PATRIOT Act concerns, because Microsoft could not guarantee the company&#x27;s data wouldn&#x27;t leave Europe.</i><p>Also, you may not have heard of FATCA, but it&#x27;s hurting business for Americans outside the US. I&#x27;m an American living in Paris and I was approached about an executive level position at a company that really wanted me because I&#x27;m an expert in my field. However, due to the nature of the position, I&#x27;d have signing authority over this company&#x27;s accounts. This triggers FATCA laws which would compel this <i>European</i> company with <i>no</i> US business to spend a lot of money preparing financial statements to turn over to the IRS. The exposure and cost outweighed the benefits of hiring me. I&#x27;m not the only American abroad whose been screwed this way thanks to US laws. The laws are designed to catch rich tax dodgers, but they wind up punishing a bunch of innocent Americans like myself (I&#x27;m a very far cry from rich).<p>On top of that, many Americans abroad are now losing banking services due to FATCA (<a href=""http://www.overseas-exile.com/2012/07/ing-france-turning-away-us-customers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overseas-exile.com/2012/07/ing-france-turning-awa...</a>), meaning that for many Americans abroad, it&#x27;s getting very hard to do any sort of business at all. Eduardo Saverin, the Facebook cofounder who famously gave up his US citizenship strongly hinted that this was blocking his business opportunities, so like some Americans abroad, you&#x27;re faced with giving up your US citizenship or giving up your business. Not a fun choice.<p><i>TL;DR</i>: Americans abroad are getting squeezed out of business opportunities thanks to FATCA and American businesses abroad are losing customers due the PATRIOT Act. If you&#x27;re in business, it&#x27;s a rough time to be a US expat and all the business opportunities we lose are going to foreign companies. Thanks, Congress!",1371826753

That and it&#x27;s a small company so I&#x27;d imagine that&#x27;ll just open up liability.<p>They do list the battery as 53.28Wh however. Let&#x27;s do some back-of-the-envelope.<p>At 2.0GHz the 4750HQ TDP is 47W. Chipset TDP is 2.7W.

I cringe when I recall the false delight audience members experience when presenters start with something such as &quot;We got an artist from Greece on board and a physicist from Austria, even some magicians from Latvia.&quot;  These statements have absurdist, Babel-ish, and feel-good value, but are by no means indicators of practical success.  More likely, it&#x27;s a bunch of bored people from around the world uniting briefly to achieve a highly idiosyncratic and quickly forgotten result.<p>It&#x27;s fun to imagine statements like: &quot;We put together one developer from Connecticut, a graphic artist from Rhode Island, and -even a web hacker from Massachusetts-&quot;.  This contrast shows how the practice of making something exotic and worshiping it takes place.  It&#x27;s one form of how we Americans inhibit ourselves from greatness - when we tell ourselves that people from $country are automatically more skilled, wise, experienced than us.  Their introductions should lead with their benefits, not where their parents knocked boots.<p>I have also been on the mailing list of more than one musician who lists countries to build social proof with statements such as &quot;I received grants to perform in Belgium, Holland, England and Germany.&quot;  It&#x27;s really only a weak form of imperialism to be invited and funded by a single individual or a committee, rather than to have populist acceptance and/or paying customers.

5918200,comment,5918015,5918015,14,0,bpatrianakos,,,"This is a great addition to PHP. Before, most new devs would either skip hashing passwords altogether or use `md5()` or `sha1()`. So you&#x27;d end up with databases with passwords in plaintext or easily cracked. Bcrypt frameworks for PHP were too confusing for beginners. If you were lucky you were using a framework that took care of hashing and salting passwords and if you were extremely lucky you had bcrypt available on your PHP install and that framework used it.<p>But that didn&#x27;t always happen. There do exist experienced PHP devs who would do password storage the right way but PHP up until now neither made it easy nor encourage these practices as they relate to passwords. Now I hope word gets out about this and people stop using md5() thinking their passwords are safe. Not that md5 is necessarily bad, but most people don&#x27;t realize there are better tools for maintaining secure passwords.<p>Also, this reminds me a little bit of `has_secure_password` method in Rails minus some of the automation that comes with it.",1371825249

It&#x27;s a fantastic experience but by far the biggest benefit, and most memorable moments, were from the people I met (even though I&#x27;m not really a &#x27;people&#x27; person). Couchsurfing allows you to stay for free with a local host.. think AirBnB but FREE and where you can actually speak and interact with them. Most of the hosts in the more remote countries are fellow American&#x27;s doing Peace Corp. It&#x27;s interesting to hear their different perspective on their host country, and they enjoy the contact with another &#x27;westerner&#x27; too. Lots of other hosts will happily invite you sailing, climbing, hiking, BBQing with them or their mates too.<p>If you&#x27;re happy to sleep on the floor occasionally (rarely in my experience) then I highly recommend any travellers (particularly solo) give it a go.<p>If you&#x27;re really adventurous, or want some even more amazing, serendipitous encounters with incredible people, stick out your thumb ;-)",1371825060

How can others have freedom, whatever it is, when your interest, whatever it is, is profiting off them, instead of doing work that profits off, say, chaos and energy by making it useful at least to you, if not others as well? How can you yourself even have any meaningful development as a person that way?<p>If you plant a fruit tree in your garden, and only you get to eat the fruit, and it makes you happy, then we&#x27;re all better off for you being happier, and those who create ideas and tools that last longer and reach farther than just their belly are considered cooler still.

There certainly was some, but from what I recall it was orders of magnitude less than it is now.  This is why it seems to me like the outrage is based on the recent factual misconceptions.  Even worse, conspiracy theories are being thrown around that go far beyond even what Greenwald originally claimed PRISM was, and those theories aren&#x27;t being scrutinized and further fuel the fire.<p>If we are going to have a debate on what the scope of electronic surveillance should be, it should be an honest one.

The implementation details vary from country to country, but save a few exceptions, laws the meet the minimum requirements of these directives must be enacted. This doesn&#x27;t always happen in practice but it&#x27;s a violation of EU law. Sometimes the laws just aren&#x27;t enforced, like the UK&#x27;s implementation of the EU cookie directive.<p>No idea about any of the rest of your comment.

Buy them in the US if it&#x27;s convenient, because they definitely aren&#x27;t cheaper in many other places.<p>Visas: US passport is usually good, but may increase the odds of being asked to pay someone off.  In Cambodia specifically, better to get a visa in advance via the official website; some of the border stations are well-known for various schemes to get extra cash from those seeking visas on arrival.  Make sure your passport starts out fairly empty--some visas take a whole page each.  For US passports, extra pages are free initially, expensive to add later.<p>Room and board: if breakfast is free, great.  But don&#x27;t buy it in advance if it&#x27;s not included, unless you&#x27;re in the middle of nowhere.<p>Transportation: hitchhiking can be easier in poorer areas where many people do it, harder in places where everyone owns a car.  For regional flights not every country does things online, and some smaller airlines do not charge a lot for last-minute tickets.<p>Packing: a 50 liter pack is enough if you don&#x27;t have many gadgets.  Take thin clothes that dry quickly, avoid jeans, wash a few items in the sink each night and enjoy perpetual clean clothes for free.  An ultralight daypack like Marmot&#x27;s Kompressor ($35) is useful, or get a cheapie abroad, e.g. $7 in Bangkok.",1371823295

696623,comment,693786,693971,0,0,scoof,,,"I'm a BBC client-side developer. For the record, I am not nor have I ever been part of the Glow team. However, I would like to point out, expressing my own view and mine alone of course, that most of the self-appointed experts on the inner workings of the BBC posting comments here appear to have entirely missed the point about Glow.<p>Firstly, whatever anyone outside the Beeb might imagine, the fact is that BBC developers are obliged to adhere to a tough set of browser support standards imposed on us from above. No Javascript library was available which met these standards. Glow came along to solve this long-standing, highly frustrating problem and has finally freed our developers to get some really useful Javascript-enhanced UIs onto BBC websites. This is its primary purpose. Offering it to the public is a nice extra but it was not the main reason for creating Glow.<p>Secondly, all this talk of how much Glow costs licence fee payers is nonsense. To my knowledge, much of the work on Glow has been implemented by a very small number of dedicated individuals, often fitting this work around other responsibilities. Glow has already saved many developer hours across the BBC by eliminating duplication of work across a number of teams and by making it a lot quicker and easier to get quality-assured JS enhancements onto our sites. Far from wasting licence fee money, over time, Glow will mean a substantial saving.<p>Thirdly, I don't really know Jake, but I kind of met him once at a meeting about Glow in its very early days. He struck me as a pretty humble, unassuming person rather than the deranged ego-tripper some of the rants on this page suggest.<p>Finally, FAO Mr Resig: Without doubt you are a true coding hero to many of my colleagues. However, if you didn't talk to Jake before now, I think you must have been mistaken in believing you had spoken to the Glow team.<p>Steven",1247172834

I find that the language has a lot to do with it.<p>At some point I was doing some modifications to Rails 2.0 internals (the public APIs to these sorts of things never expose the needed functionality) and I found it pretty much impossible to predict when something would get executed (if at all).<p>Figuring out how Rails is wired demands serious spelunking. Forget reading.  You invariably need to get out the profiler and browse call graphs, and then shotgun-pepper the code with thrown exceptions to see where in the stack they come up - and this is just to figure out how it's put together.  (Hint: a template handler in Rails 2.3 gets called 32 stack levels deep, at least two of which are a benchmarker).<p>I think this has much to do with all the ""magical"" stuff, so it might be particular to Rails - but I also think that the easy power of the language gives programmers a lot of rope to hang their readers with.<p>I wonder if an easier, ""fun"" like Ruby language makes people cavalier about setting up crazy structures, whereas ""difficult"" languages like C++ make people a bit conservative - the language is complicated enough, so why make it worse with crazy design?",1247172829

Safari 4 is slick and runs much lighter and faster than firefox 3, however firefox 3.5 really levels the playing field and makes the comparison about features rather than resource consumption.<p>When you compare the two on features, safari is lacking. While safari has clean tools built in for web development, they are more for looking at a page rather than messing around with it. I find it a pain to go and change styles or elements in safari and also you can't delete elements out of the dom in safari which I find very annoying. Firebug is not as polished looking, but it definitely has the best set of features. Also firefox's extensive set of plugins is tough to live without.<p>I enjoyed my time with Safari, it was a very elegant polished experience, but web hacking is rarely both, which is where firefox and its plugins feature set really shines.",1247172290

The bootstrap package contains everything a node needs to come alive. Ours consists of not much more than a script that immediately runs via the post-install hook.

And, I can see how it could have niche uses in various industries.  But, the people saying that the 3d printer will change the world as we know it (or whatever other grand predictions) haven't explained to me how it will be anything more than a great proto-typing/mold-making tool for casting/machining operations or customers of those businesses.

696565,comment,695947,696122,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Well, it doesn't solve problems for you. In a nutshell, by lowering the firing threshold of your neurons (especially within the visual cortex) it's as if you've had everything amped up and given an echo. This makes pretty much everything appear novel and different - when I used to go to a lot of raves, you  could often tell who the first-time acid users were because they would spend extra time looking at their hands, and with good reason.<p>If you've taken the right-sized dose, it's not unlike having the novelty factor of childhood combined with the intellectual development of adulthood. Much also depends on your mood, flexibility of mind and so forth. It doesn't combine well (for me, anyway) with directed activity like coding or trying to record (rather than play) music since you space out continually. If you try to push too hard in a specific mental direction, it'll push back and you may get frustrated or confused, which can lead to upset.<p>If you just go with the flow, on the other hand, all kinds of new perspectives and insights will pop up. These are not all equally good, <i>qua</i> the oft-repeated stories of people jumping off balconies in the belief they can fly and so forth. These do have some basis in reality, though generally the people involve tend to be massively loaded, sometimes on more than 1 drug. Unless you have one of those Jekyll & Hyde personalities where you turn into someone completely different when you get drunk this is probably not an issue, but you do need to be  responsible to yourself and considerate of other people - there is nothing more irritating than an acid asshole that thinks the world should adjust to their trip rather than the other way around. The right way to handle is to store your insights (your memory will wok fine) without getting overly caught up in them - some will turn out to be purely frivolous others can have deep lasting value.<p>Having said all that, the scope of the experience is very hard to articulate. It's like the difference between experiencing a videogame as a player vs. firing up the level editor and/or reading the source code. On the other hand, you might go from wondering who moved your cheese to concluding that you are a lab rat in some bizarre cosmic experiment. Or indeed, both at the same time.",1247170126

I did an estimate using their user numbers (not hard find since the networks publish them) and assuming similar revenue per user (RPU) to our games and guesstimated $75m. Their games probably also have higher RPU than ours, so I could totally see $100m or even significantly more now that FarmVille is taking off.<p>On the other hand, as MixPanel pointed out, they buy a LOT of traffic. Not just on Myspace either. On both networks you can build a compelling enough game to get your RPU above the cost of buying a user. The difference between the two is that on Facebook, your app can succeed without that.<p>Zynga's spending what has to be at least $2m/mo in ads, maybe 3 or 4.  They're also using ads on their games to cross promote with other games, and those ads could be bringing in money too. When you factor that in, as high as 50% of their revenue could be going right out the door to advertising. (I don't think that's the case though, if I had to venture a guess I'd say 20-25%).",1247169892

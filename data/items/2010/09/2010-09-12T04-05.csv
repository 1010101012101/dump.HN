I'm a CpE major who, on account of being denied a double major, is cherry picking the upper level math classes (Abstract Algebra, Number Theory and Group Theory).  Abstract algebra teaches methods of problem solving that you can't really learn somewhere else.  Reducing a problem to rings or groups let's you simplify it drastically.  While most problems aren't exactly a direct ring or group, similar approaches can be taken.

cooler, and with a more abstract version of events. It implements a lot 
of the primitives I've been considering but haven't built yet. It looks 
more difficult to set up, and has a commercial offering for support and 
HA; neither of which are present in Riemann right now.</i>[1]<p>I recently finished building a monitoring system using Esper and JRuby since the client asked specifically for that, but I wished I had used Riemann from the beginning.<p>[1]

Now I wonder what would qualify as backup considering I want it to be automated and preferably not require me to write to media like DVDs. (Time Machine seems to be doing the trick on the Mac side, although... having all the backup media connected to the machine it's backing up means it's susceptible to simultaneous deletion, as well not being offsite means it is susceptible to theft/fire.) On the Windows side, I've been backing up just ""important"" files with dropbox, which has the benefit of being offsite and automated. I once used Mozy, but when I needed to do a restore they had problems generating a recovery image for me. I think they eventually got access to all the files after a few days.

You will not, in fact, sit before a jury of your ""peers"", especially if you are knowledgeable about the law.  Juries are generally selected to find the most pliant, least informed individuals.<p>2. Juries are not immune to the problems of group mentalities.  You could easily be in a situation where a majority of the jurors, if asked on the street, would never consider such an act criminal, but when placed in an isolated group with one or more authoritative-sounding busybodies, will agree to convict (see the Milgram experiment).<p>3. Jurors are specifically instructed to evaluate the case on its merits (does the law as written apply to the act committed by this individual?), and to disregard personal opinions and feelings about the nature of the law itself.  This is related to the discussion on ""jury nullification"" by other posters.<p>4. A trial is an exhausting, humiliating, and possibly financially devastating process.  You will not even get the opportunity to present your case, if you are under duress from the circumstances created by the prosecution and agree to a plea bargain instead.",1356371454

4963514,comment,4962770,4962770,4,0,tokenadult,,,"The interesting comments posted before mine prompted me to read the whole fine article kindly submitted here. The article beings with ""There's an entire generation where every photo, message, post, idea between adolescence and adulthood is cataloged on Facebook."" The posting of photos as conveniently as Facebook allows posting photos is somewhat new (as is home Internet connections with enough bandwidth to put up with an online service jam full of photos), but on the whole this doesn't feel new to me.<p>Maybe Facebook doesn't feel new to me because I am old (born during the Eisenhower administration, just as the Space Age was beginning). To me, Facebook in 2012 seems much like AOL in 1998: a huge, dominant force in Internet interaction among the general public that is already doomed by fundamental flaws in its business plan. I'm old, and I have seen predictions come and go over the years, but this is my prediction about Facebook, and I'm sticking to it: ""Facebook will go the way of AOL, still being a factor in the industry years from now, but also serving as an example of a company that could never monetize up to the level of the hype surrounding it.""<p>Facebook makes it MORE apparent, if anything, than the earlier forms of online communication did how selectively people report details about their lives in online communities. I've known some good friends through online acquaintance, interspersed with real-world interaction, for twenty years. I'm well aware that the online picture of any person is incomplete, just as the knowledge of one person by any one acquaintance is incomplete. I think Facebook provides some convenience in keeping up with a varied group of Facebook ""friends"" including several of my first cousins, one of my children who has grown up and moved away from home (he was an early adopter of Facebook, and is now largely tired of it), former co-workers, classmates, current members of the same professional associations, and so on. It's a lot of fun to see friends from different phases of my life interact and learn from one another. I've managed to make my Facebook wall be like a targeted Hacker News: a place where I can find thoughtful discussion of links I discover while Web-browsing. To me, that's something well worth growing old with.<p>The article includes the paragraph: ""You can message someone you haven't spoken with in years, and yet it visually flows right under some unimaginably unrelated conversation from 2007. And when you realize that exact numerical gap between the years, it stings a little. Reading how you've changed, how they've changed, and thinking about everything that didn't happen in-between."" That is the most startling default setting of the Facebook messaging system. My email inbox, which is sorted strictly by date order, obscures the gaps in communication I have with some correspondents. (Cleaning out my drafts folder from time to time discloses those gaps.) But real-world analogies of this are receiving Christmas cards after a gap of a few years in correspondence, and the like. The strength of communication in each relationship ebbs and flows, or so I have observed for more than five decades now.",1356371363

Since October, individual Dropbox users are encouraged to create separate accounts when invited to a Team and warned that Teams admins will have control over the account.<p>We want individual and Team Dropbox users to have the best possible experience. Some users want to migrate their personal accounts into a Team. Others are much happier with separate personal and Teams accounts. Weve been working to make that choice much clearer for the account holder and the Teams admin.<p>If users do choose to merge their personal account with a Team, things become a bit tricky. Teams admins want better control of data within a Team, and users want easy access to their personal stuff, but its not possible for us to differentiate between Team data and personal stuff in the same account.<p>Here are some thoughts on the points raised by the OP:<p>* Better support for multiple accounts: Users can quickly switch between using personal and Teams accounts on the web today and we intend to make this better across our platforms.<p>* Improved messaging to Teams admins: We plan to provide better messaging to admins before disabling an account that was migrated in.<p>* Disabled accounts are not immediately deleted: We can work with Teams admins and users to sort out account issues and recover users files.<p>Weve contacted the OP to help resolve his case and are sorry for any pain this caused!",1356371316

Then I believe the following approach would be the best approach for less power.<p>Pick your target spectrum range, Then using a highpower transmitter higher powered than the other as above to do a very granular spectrum hopping around the spectrum but at least transmitting on every channel within that spectrum at a period of frequency that would be greater than normal error corrected interferance by that your signal would then cover the spectrum range alocated but instead of having to do a wide band of the entire spectrum you are picking channels (by channels I mean frequency range that is not interfeared with by either side as you can have a transmission on wifi say that is on channel 3 and can be picked up faintly if your on channel 1, bad example but you should follow what I'm meaning by channel in this case of a spectrum block) at a time interval that would exceed error correction and as such rendering others use of the channel extreemly hard and with that all channels in the defined frequency range, aka spectrum.<p>Now by doing that you would need the least amount of power to block others use of that spectrum and at the same time have a very wide albeit spectrum hopping chunk of bandwith to use and abuse and the faster you make the spectrum hopping to break error handerling of others trying to use that range.<p>Of course with that approach you would have details to work on like frequency channels and how granular you defined those and also the level of error correction you wish to defeat.  Remember if you want to compete with others digital transmissions then this is great BUT with analogue it may very well be a case that somebody talking would still be understandable with the level of interfearance.  A look at signal type and how it would be analoguely(sic) interpreted is one aspect that may effect how you encode your data as you may end up disrupting the receaving speaker enough to impeede the other signals sound transmision.  There is also the aspect of how long you stay on a channel at certain frequencies with some needing longer than others to transmit something usable and the fun of recieving the signal out of step as different frequencies propergate(travel) at different rates(speed) so that would cause out of step reception, though easily countered if your aware of that design aspect.<p>NOW there is a far far easier way and sadly I don't think it is what I would calla hacker approach and is more the script-kiddie solution.  That would be to send a silly large pulse on the frequency so strong that it blows all the transmitters.  Now you would need to inform your chaps ahead so they could switch of and fold there areils in half type of thing ahead of your radio nuke or more a radio DOS attack.  Then they could setup ready afterwards and you would of blown all other recievers and with that the only people who can listern are those you want to listern.  Not elegant, but certainly a partial solution that would be cheap to implement as it is that crude, hence not what I call a pure hacker solution.  I also suspect the amount of power to do this would exceed the prize money being offered, so you would be pushed and indeed insane to build and test such an approach.",1356370478

4963394,comment,4961773,4963275,5,0,gregpilling,,,"The world of auto mechanics is split into two categories. You have the people in the trade because they genuinely love cars and then you have the people who went into auto repair because their high school guidance counsellor said they should. The first group you could identify with as the hackers, the people that take stuff apart because they find it fascinating, and this interest level over a number of years combines to make them rockstars. This is referred to as the 10,000 hour effect on HN. With the other group, they end up doing basic work but never doing the high pay, challenging work. The common slang for this group is ""Mouthbreathers"" (1).<p>So there kind of isn't an average non-rockstar mechanic. I will try to answer your question anyway. A person changing oil and doing brake pad replacement might make between $8-12 in Tucson. This worker would not do any engine diagnostics, nor any specialty work like alignment, air conditioning service, or any problems that would be unusual. A surprising number of problems auto shops repair is unusual. Things like ""What is that noise at 70 when I hit a bump"" which can often be a hard puzzle to solve.<p>A better mechanic who can use all the equipment could earn up to $1000 per week as a base, but more typically would be paid on a flat rate basis. So you might get $25 per hour flat rate, and you pay would be $25 x #ofhourscharged . The ""flat rate"" is typically based on Mitchell Time Guides, which was a book and is now a DVD which lists the expected times to do a standard repair. Unusual problems are not covered in this book, which is somewhat inaccurate but is the best the industry has. (Startup idea: crowdsourced auto repair times).<p>Specialized skills can get you more money, like any other business. If you are fantastic at transmission repair, or at engine diagnostics, or at solving diesel problems, then you can almost set your own rate. I have a friend who could make a few hundred per hour solving engine drivability problems, but I will note that he is unique. He fixed IBM mainframes before turning to cars. He has his own shop, and works by himself. He fixes cars in a day that other shops have spent weeks on before giving up.<p>Dealership mechanics can make the most money. A few reasons: 
- They work on new cars, so nothing is rusted or dirty. No rusted bolts to slow you down.
- they work on the same cars over and over again, they become familiar
- they have warranty work coming in, and recall work
- the dealership charges more per hour typically than an independent shop
- the dealer is forced to buy the latest equipment, and to send mechanics for training
- the automakers restrict repair information from the auto repair aftermarket<p>Remember that cars are complex systems now. They involve mechanical parts, electronic parts, wear items, user behavior, and you never have enough information to solve the problem. You don't get to see the source code on anything, most of the time you are diagnosing blind. There are no logs to review besides the trouble codes. Trouble Codes only tell you what the opinion of the ECU is, not reality. I sold several million dollars of equipment based on this distinction.<p>(1)Side note: once (1996) I won a cruise with 4000 other Snap-on Tools people. My ice-breaking question was ""How many mechanics do you let work on your car?"" with the typical answer being ""none"" or ""just a couple"" which is revealing if you consider that on average a Snap-on Tools dealer has 300 customers. So 1% pass the standard of a salesman who visits him once a week.",1356368723

It&#x27;s an incredibly important topic, so I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s some chat about it.<p>> To me a more interesting question is how will this impact keyword data that&#x27;s pasted through the referring URL?<p>Doesn&#x27;t Google have a redirect mechanism that allows referrer information to pass through when a &#x27;blue link&#x27; is clicked?",1434502792

But a sustained negative publicity campaign—from people within the organization, as well as completely unrelated companies like Ok Cupid—and they backed down.<p>In some cases, they might actually be more aggressive about it, since usually they care about <i>something</i>, and so quick to drop things that interfere with that thing.  Take World Vision, for instance.  They&#x27;re a non-profit devoted to supporting orphans.  They changed their policy to allow homosexual employees—but a campaign from their primarily evangelical Christian supporters cost them millions of dollars in donations, so they reversed the policy after two days.  Did they still feel that allowing homosexual employees was correct?  Almost definitely.  But they cared more about their work supporting orphans, so anything that got in the way was removed.",1434502325

Well, 20 min... far enough that &quot;drove 40 minutes to pick up local produce&quot; starts to sound dumb, though.

The closest large town to where I live has about 8K people; that&#x27;s big enough for them to have a (smallish) dedicated organic/specialty grocery store, and street markets every weekend, year-round, with a few organic farms selling their produce there.<p>If I drive into Limoges, there are several large grocery stores that sell only organic produce, and highlight local produce.<p>These are all noticeably more expensive than shopping at a regular Super-U or Casino/Geant (big chains), but the selection and quality is quite good.<p>I&#x27;ll check into the Ruche near here to see what it&#x27;s like; but if it&#x27;s the same farmers we can buy from directly at the weekend market, I&#x27;m not sure I see the point.<p>Edit: &quot;276 Membres&quot;...

Moreover, I don&#x27;t know how old you are but I suspect you are too young to realize how the world worked prior to the internet. It is true that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t until the 1800s that the newspaper in the modern sense it came about&quot; but this is irrelevant to my point. The modern form of the newspapers was the endpoint of a long consolidation -- ripples from the invention of the printing press. Nevertheless the modern form survived for over 100 years.<p>Once the social role of newspapers was established it was impossible to supplant them prior to the internet. The New York Times (primarily) really replaced the Catholic Church as the cultural maypole. Moreover, if you were even alive in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s you would know that all the major TV networks took their lead from the NYT, they were followers. Old habit die hard so TV continues to follow in the internet age (partly because TV is now just entertainment not a major cultural influence). I think we agree TV was a major technological creation and certainly changed society but it did not challenge the newspapers for social power and influence nor change the power structures of society like the printing press or the internet. Today the NYT is dead as a cultural institution and something WILL take its place but I don&#x27;t think anyone really knows what that will be.<p>In any event, my point is obvious to me but won&#x27;t be obvious to everyone until 100 years out which is the nature of a revolution of this scale.",1434501821

That&#x27;s what &quot;steak&quot; means: beef, one coherent piece of it, cooked by direct heat. &quot;Steak&quot; does not necessarily refer to a 1.5lb porterhouse on the bone.<p>So in that sense, &quot;steak&quot; is no different than any other protein you&#x27;d put in a sandwich. We don&#x27;t call chicken breast cutlets &quot;chicken steaks&quot;, but we could (indeed, that&#x27;s how we sometimes refer to large slabs of tuna).<p>Objecting to &quot;steak sandwiches&quot; is therefore a little odd. If anything, a steak sandwich is bound to be healthier than a burger; a restaurant burger is typically 20% fat, while even a ribeye --- which is rarely what&#x27;s in a steak sandwich --- can be below that number.<p>A steak sandwich also shouldn&#x27;t be anything close to 1000 calories. There are ~300 calories in a typical grilled cheese sandwich. Take that as the basis for &quot;ambient sandwich calories&quot; and add 4oz of skirt steak; you&#x27;re now at 500 calories, for which is essentially a fried sandwich.<p>Of course, you&#x27;re probably much better off eating 4oz of skirt steak (protein, fat calories) than a stroopwafel (refined sugar, carbs).",1434500025

I know people will object and say they hire for talent and not resume keywords, but that hasn&#x27;t been my experience as a candidate.<p>The reason employers want full-stack instead of back-end is that it cuts down on the communication overhead.  You can do it all yourself, rather than handing off the front-end bit to other people.  I&#x27;d rather hand off tricky front-end work to someone who knows it better.<p>My experience is mostly back-end, but recently I&#x27;ve been doing some simple front-end work.  It makes more sense to have separate back-end and front-end specialists, but that isn&#x27;t the way things are done anymore.<p>I wrote a video poker practice game in Javascript/jQuery/PHP/C++.  It works, and my father is playing it, and he likes it.  It isn&#x27;t fancy modern web style, but it runs and gets the job done.  (Javascript/jQuery on the client, with simple CSS.  PHP with a shell_exec to C++ to do the calculation of the optimal strategy.  The client does an AJAX call to get the next hand.)<p>Try writing something like minesweeper or a sudoku game in Javascript/CSS for practice.",1434499874

My guess was that the difference would go the other way -- that Xen would be more efficient, because it was designed for paravirtualization rather than hardware emulation, and the guest kernels had to be modified to accommodate it.",1434499313
9729392,comment,9728613,9728949,0,0,geofft,,,"&quot;Paravirtualization&quot; can refer to two somewhat different things, both of which count as guest-assisted virtualization. The original idea behind paravirtualization, and originally the only type of virtualization in Xen, was one where Xen presented itself as its own PC-incompatible machine type using the x86 instruction set, and you had to port the boot code, memory management code, etc. over to Xen hypercalls, and you don&#x27;t have access to real mode, the x86 MMU, etc. But you <i>also</i> need to port all your driver code (disks, networking, graphics) to Xen hypercalls, since you also no longer have access to the BIOS interrupts, PCI bus, etc.<p>It&#x27;s possible to isolate the second part -- paravirtualized drivers -- without requiring the first part -- paravirtualized bootup. Since bootup isn&#x27;t guest-assisted any more, the hypervisor now has to emulate the entire PC-compatible boot process, including minimal emulation of BIOS interrupts for disk access, etc. But once that&#x27;s completed, you can switch to paravirtualized drivers for optimized performance, and the actual performance benchmarks people care about are the steady-state disk and network bandwidth.<p>The only somewhat tricky thing is that you need to handle MMU updates somehow. I believe (but don&#x27;t know for certain) that with nested page table support at the processor level, you can just safely give x86 hardware-virtualized guests access to their nested page tables, and they can use the same instructions to modify that as they would on native hardware. So you don&#x27;t need paravirtualization for that. This support has been in hardware since around 2008.<p>One of the benefits of using paravirtualized drivers alone, instead of an entire paravirtualized boot process, is that you can support OSes where you can write custom drivers but you can&#x27;t change the boot code. So, for instance, the KVM project has Windows disk and network drivers that use the paravirtualized interface (virtio):<p><a href=""http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/WindowsGuestDrivers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/WindowsGuestDrivers</a><p>You can continue to use Windows without this support, which will use the slow, emulated disk and network hardware. But if you have the drivers, things will get much faster. This is a best-of-both-worlds approach: you can continue to run any OS (since full virtualization support remains present), but you can switch to the paravirt drivers and get steady-state performance competitive with paravirt-only hypervisors.",1434499310

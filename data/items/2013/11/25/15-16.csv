I remember how this played out <i>very well</i>.<p>At the time, IBM had sent in scores of company reps to train up our floor staff on the advantages of OS/2 over the always-soon-to-be-released Chicago. They did a good job getting all of us to &quot;drink the Kool Aid&quot;. I received a free (not pirated, promotional) copy of blue OS/2 Warp 3.0. It was a fantastic operating system for running a DOS based multi-node Telegard BBS and it did well with Win16 applications.<p>The impact of Windows 95 coming on the scene, though, is difficult to fully appreciate unless you were there. We had been selling pre-orders for months and there were a myriad of promos. I remember some of those preorders were sold under the threat that there wouldn&#x27;t be enough copies to go around on release day. I had been playing with pirated copies of the betas of Windows 95 for the prior two months. Even in its beta form, it ran circles around Windows 3.0/3.1 in terms of reliability. I even remember reloading my PC with the most recent beta after release because a DOS application I used ran more reliably in it than in the RTM code.<p>Then launch day came. It was unlike anything I had ever seen in terms of a software release. We closed up at 9:00 PM and re-opened at 12:00 midnight to a line of customers that went around the building --- A line of customers ... for an operating system. We joked at the time that &quot;Windows really was <i>that</i> bad&quot;.  There were tons of additional promotions to ensure people came and lined up--Some RAM / hard disks selling under &quot;cost&quot; and others. And the atmosphere of the store felt like a party. We had theme music playing (start me up?) and some Microsoft video playing on our higher-end multi-media PCs. It was obvious to us, on the floor, trained by IBMs marketing machine, that Warp died that day.<p>As an anecdote to the stories about IBMs marketing being a little off: I remember around the release of Warp 4.0 I saw an advertisement at a subway station something along the lines of &quot;Warp Obliterated my PC!&quot;-- that tagline, evidently, meant to be some hip new use of the word obliterated.",1385395038

I presume for the demo, you must have used a custom SDK build so that you could tap into some private APIs?

I decided to build an app to show what I could do.<p>I spent 2 1/2 months building an app called Dashku. It was a realtime dashboard, and when I put it on Hacker News, it went to #1 within 45 minutes, and then the server fucked up because the ulimit config on the app server (which I had set but not persisted between reboots) was 1024, and got the flak I deserved for not making sure that the ulimit config has persisted when I configured the machines.<p>After doing it, these things happened:<p>- Bechtel contacted me and asked if they could use it internally. They did.<p>- I had a meeting with Geckoboard. They asked if I wanted to work for them, and I offered to sell Dashku to them. No bite.<p>- I interviewed at Forward Labs in London. I had about 4 interviews in the space of 2-3 days, but did not get the job offer. I failed to refactor a fill detection algorithm which was functional and fully tested, but memory inefficient. I had stayed up all night to crack it, slept for 2 hours and had no food when I came in for the interview and was asked to refactor it.<p>ProTip: Sleep well and eat before you go for an interview, otherwise your brain suffers for it.<p>Eventually, I got a job in London working for webcasting company, and then open sourced Dashku. Here&#x27;s what happened next:<p>- Ninja Blocks gave me a free Ninja Block, and asked me if I would like to work with them.<p>- An Indian health startup asked to integrate Dashku into their IoT robotics app.<p>- A BI startup basically took Dashku, slapped a coat of paint on it, and called it their own.<p>- Another IoT startup asked to use it.<p>- An energy company told me they were going to drop Geckoboard for my app.<p>- I discovered a professional social network (called Viadeo) had created a wonderful collection of widgets for it.<p>Then,<p>- I got an email from someone at Facebook, they said that they were evaluating it for internal use, and asked me if I would like to interview with them in California.<p>I had to decline as my mother has health problems and I could not move to another country.<p>All of this, within 14 months of being fired from a startup.<p>Failure feels like crap, but don&#x27;t let it define who you are; you have to move on and prove to yourself and to others what you can achieve.

At the time, I was a undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin, and IBM needed summer intern testers for a product they were calling &quot;OS/2 Lan Server Enterprise&quot;. OS/2 LSE was IBM&#x27;s effort to re-platform OS/2 LAN Server on top of OS/2 DCE (in development on the lab next door to LSE). The general idea was to provide a way to scale up OS/2 so that it would interoperate with other DCE-based systems (mainly RS/6000 AIX, IIRC).<p>Anyway, the machine IBM gave me to use was a PS/2 Model 80. This was a 1988-era machine that had been brought to the semi-modern era with 20MB of RAM memory installed via several MCA expansion cards. Against my best expectations, the machine ran well, despite the fact that its CPU was at least 10% the speed of the then-state of the art.<p>From what I remember, the OS/2 LSE product itself was fairly solid. However, the biggest memory I have from that summer was the afternoon we spent playing around with the Microsoft Windows 95 beta disk we received for compatability testing. Towards the end of the afternoon, we tried to DriveSpace (compress) the disk. We got bored during the wait for the compress, so we pulled the power on the machine thinking that would be the end of it.  However, once we powered the machine back up to install OS/2, Windows 95 just resumed compressing away like nothing happened. A few weeks later, a friend and I went to CompUSA for the Windows95 launch.  Even at midnight, there was a line out the door, winding past the Windows 95 boxes, then the Plus Pack, then Office 95, and then memory upgrades... Didn&#x27;t hear much about OS/2 after that...",1385392036

(below knowledge is from my research on topic)\nMy main concern is storing data.\n- Use RDBMS. PostgreSQL, because I need location based features so I may use PostGIS.\n- use Couchbase or cassandra. Why? because doing activity stream with RDBMS maybe slow due to joins. In NoSQL, most of the time I will not be able to use joins, so I will design denormalized tables for activity streams (maybe I am wrong) Also couchbase seems fast, and it contains memcached inside, s caching layer and scaling layer will be there on install.\nAs far as I understand if you use couchbase you can retrieve data in json, so it will reduce converting data to json in backend app. side, where I am going to use pythn/django.\n- I need search so I am going to use elastic search, in that case couchbase can be a good fit, since they have a plugin for ES, which may boost development time. \nWhat would you recommend?

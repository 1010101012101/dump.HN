(That's valid, just clarifying.)<p>Of course, it could be no other way, since I'm hardly the only one who feels this way.<p>As my message implies, I'm not actually on Facebook, but my wife yesterday registered a complaint about a cousin I have that ""likes"" a couple dozen things a day. (And again, disclaimer, I don't actually take the HN discussions to her, as a non-tech person she ends up bringing them to me. These are not uncommon feelings.) Of course Facebook is just selling eyeballs, but there's a delicate dance of deception they must do with their users to not let it become blatent. If it becomes blindingly obvious that the users are taking second priority to the real customers, the users will eventually leave, and then where will the real customers be?",1340899186

I took a Material's Engineering class in college and I remember the professor saying that the ""theoretical"" strength of materials (in general) was supposed to be extremely high, orders of magnitude higher than what you find in real life. The disparity is a result of imperfections in the crystal lattices of the materials. You can probably build a graphene tube 50nm in length and find that at <i>that</i> scale it has all those superior properties, especially since at that size you are almost handling molecules <i>individually</i> and can arrange them correctly. But what happens when you go up in the scale? Will it retain all of those wonderful properties to the same extent?",1340899044

But I'm not, so you'll have to have one here.<p>I gave up on git rebase after getting exactly the problem you describe, when trying to rebase my temp branch (with new stuff, including files that were entirely commented out in one commit then deleted in the next) on top of my main branch (with fixes to stuff the temp branch deletes or changes). I'd rebased things before, mostly because I'd heard it was what you were supposed to do, and it hadn't been a problem those times, but this time was awful!<p>Lots of tiresome conflicts, as git kept badgering me about merge conflicts due to one branch commenting out what another branch had changed, all in a file that would be deleted by the next commit. Of course, none of this crops up during a merge, because it only needs to consider the results rather than each intermediate step - so the merge ended up being much neater. (I think there ended up being fewer merge conflicts across the whole merge than there were in one file in the first step of the rebase.)<p>The idea behind this was that I'd rebase, then use rebase -i to remove the separate cleanup steps, then I could merge into the main branch, and it would be a nice fast-forward. I don't like the idea of using rebase -i until I've got something rebased as it stands, but it seems that git isn't always going to make that easy.<p>Since then, I've stuck with git merge, and indeed I've come to quite like seeing where the merges are in the history.

I worked at two companies that had patents on software algorithms, but our software was just a reference implementation. Explain to me how a company like ARM would operate relying on just copyright and trade secrets.

4172165,comment,4163124,4167368,1,0,blueprint,,,"> Look. You are not enlightened, so you cannot know what it is to be enlightened. Simple logic.<p>I've only claimed that Tathagata is a truly Enlightened being and asked you to confirm what happened to him. But your logic is flawed. There are certain axiomatic qualities of Enlightenment, and one of them is realizing things in the actuality. Therefore, what an Enlightened being says about truth and actuality should be verifiable (as well as stated falsifiably). So there are certain non-trivial things that ordinary people can know about the state of and get from the teaching of an Enlightened Being, even if they can't yet see from the same level or have as much virtue.<p>The people who make claims that Enlightenment is not externally verifiable are usually practitioners of meditation or looking to sell you something.<p>> From what you just wrote, you seem to think possession of abilities or 'siddhis' means one is enlightened. Buddha stated putting those into reverence is an impediment on the way to enlightenment.<p>I'm not sure the formal meaning of siddhi, never heard the term, but that's probably not what I'm indicating. The term ability can be applied to a wide range of things. How are you using the term (what abilities are you indicating)?<p>> Overall, take a look at your position. You are clinging to conventional knowledge. You are speaking of things you claim knowledge of, but never experienced firsthand. You then use your incomplete, second-hand knowledge as a basis for what enlightenment is and how a being is to get there. You are spreading false knowledge and ignorance. Become enlightened beyond any doubt and then come tell people who is wrong and why you are right.<p>There are two categories we can put things in the world into: those that are visible and those that are invisible. To see the visible, we need to open our eyes and we need to learn about what exists and how it exists. To see something that is invisible, on the other hand, we need a principle. What is taught at universities, however, is just how to make logic, which can easily be fed different words or the wrong assumptions and can output the wrong result. There is no one at universities I've met who satisfactorily understands the principle of how the world is operated, so they cannot perceive things which are outside their own knowledge (that of human beings) or that which is derived from their own knowledge. That is why I sometimes may point out something which falls outside your field of vision.

I don;t know if this makes the floor unconstitutional, and indeed I would suspect it might.  This weakens the law in ways that a lot of people might not expect, and it also deeply constrains Congress's power to do things like this in the future.<p>2)  The states won regarding Medicaid.  They got, quite frankly, more than they asked for, even though the court did not invalidate the provision.  The court (7-2) said that Congress could require use participation in new programs.  This means that states can opt out of the new Medicaid expansion and, arguably other past Medicaid expansions, like SCHIP, and the Federal Government doesn't have a lot they can do about it.<p>I don't like the mandate.

This means they can never impose criminal or even civil sanctions for not buying health insurance (and it isn't clear to me if the floor to the penalty is Constitutional under this reading).<p>The states also came out as clear winners.  The court held, 7-2, that states cannot be compelled to join the new program by threatening them with loss of their entire Medicaid funds.  In other words, if a state wants to opt out of the expansion because they don't want to pay administration costs, of if they no longer want to participate in SCHIP, DHHS can only deny them the funds for that program, not all of Medicaid.  Every major expansion that is reasonably separable now is a separate program.  This is a <i>big</i> defeat for the federal government here and a <i>big</i> win for the states.<p>The line-up on the Medicaid issue surprised me.

Effectively, it comes down to this: (1) buy health insurance and pay lower taxes; or (2) don't buy health insurance and pay higher taxes. You can't refuse to purchase health insurance and refuse to pay higher taxes. This is relevant, because of the potentially adverse impact it will have on small businesses.<p>The dissent nails it: this act eviscerates the actuarial analysis many young, healthy people use to decide whether to purchase health insurance by compelling them to subsidize health insurance of the population. This occurs because the Act binds the hands of insurers: they can't use any health characteristics of those that that they insure in deciding their premium. Ultra-healthy individuals will not be entitled to lower premiums, which is to say that the active and healthy 50-something will pay the same insurance premium as the sedentary, overweight 50-something with diabetes.<p>Politics aside, the Supreme Court made it clear that the USA is <i>not</i> a welfare state (they didn't believe the government's arguments that this was legal under the Commerce Clause or Necessary and Proper Clause), and instead upheld the mandate because of a tenuous link with Congress's ability to tax & spend for the general welfare of the population.

Otherwise why would Germany lend them any money if they are just going to fritter it away like they did getting themselves into this mess.<p>Decades of inept economic, infrastructure and education policies by incompetent leaders has put them in this place.<p>Germany, meanwhile, has dealt with a the huge unification problem with its formerly communist sister, and they have prospered, so just maybe Greece and the other bankrupt sovereign states should listen to Germany and take the bail out with their conditions.<p>If you look at it from a bigger picture level, what's happening is that you have a bunch of countries that have a terrible history of running their affairs that are hanging on to the idea of their sovereignty, despite the fact that a more united federal system would be better.

4172015,comment,4163124,4170014,1,0,blueprint,,,"> Anyone who says no one has ever attained enlightens through meditation is lying. I know he's lying because such a statement is literally impossible to support rationally and scientifically, no evidence can be provided for such a statement.<p>This is where there is a difference between your level and my level of understanding about the world.<p>What you said about knowing that someone who makes a non-falsifiable statement is a liar, is actually a lie. It's not only the fact that you didn't understand the statement (and therefore can't accurately judge if it's falsifiable), and besides the fact that you yourself do not know if there will be anyone in the future who manages to prove the statement (you're making the same mistake you're pointing out), but there's another, more essential reason that I know you don't know what you're talking about.<p>An apple tree only knows how to produce apples because that is what is encoded in its nature (origin). There is nothing in the world that shows some kind of behavior or result that it doesn't already have inside its nature.<p>The reason I can say confidently here that the practice of meditation does not lead to enlightenment and that no truly enlightened being would teach that it does, is the simple fact that meditation has a certain effect (result) on human beings (which sometimes differs slightly within small boundaries depending on individual, unless the person is already enlightened himself), and that effect on human beings is orthogonal to that of enlightenment as well as nirvana. Meditation will never be able to produce an Enlightened Being, and no one who had Supreme Enlightenment came out of any schools or religions, because they are trying to go in opposite directions - practicing meditation can create karma, but you have to remove all your karma to experience nirvana and have the possibility of being Enlightened. That is to say that Enlightenment (also known as salvation), as well as nirvana (liberation) are in the opposite direction of the goals of meditation (no suffering, darkness/closing your eyes, stopping the flow of your mind/one-pointed concentration, letting external spirits come in or practicing compassion for them, abandoning oneself, not having any attachments, and practicing not to be reborn again). The result of Enlightenment is that you save yourself, and can begin to save others. The result of meditation is that you kill your soul and die forever. So there are some basic things you've learned from others about Buddha's teaching that don't match the reality of life, and that in itself lets me know it's not the teaching of a real Buddha. Do you yourself honestly believe that a living Buddha would teach people the way to die forever? The point of him coming to the world was to show us that we are our own saviors and are capable of saving ourselves.",1340896158

It appears that a lot of people come to Startup Chile expecting the wrong things.<p>Why would you come to Chile and expect:<p>- There will be no bureaucracy (this is a government run program..)<p>- You won't have to give anything (RVAs) at all back - (equity free capital in return for what ? in that case..)<p>- Connections to US accelerators and investors (WTF ?)<p>To be honest, it's unrealistic to expect all of the above. I do agree that Startup Chile can do MANY good things (connections to latin american investors, more guidance/mentorship, etc.) but why not take into account the fact that this is a young program being run by a government in a country with very less startup experience.<p>Here are some positive points I've heard from people:<p>- Use government connections. Folks who have their startups in fields where government help can work eg. education, social service, etc. are able to uniquely utilize startup chile's clout in the government sector.<p>- Learn some Spanish.<p>- Do something relevant. You're hardly going to get support if you're designing a product that solves a problem in the US  or elsewhere (with no possible extension into Latin America). Besides, why would a local investor be interested in that case ?<p>As for the part where filing statements, getting reimbursed, etc. - there's no need to whine about that. The processes have been streamlined a lot over the past few months and these guys seem to be working on it more, there is definitely good faith involved and it's not all ""Oh yeah we're going to make them WORK for their money"". They just need to be sure that your expenses are justified. I know of people who are trying to squeeze out an iPhone or two in their reimbursements. They naturally have to be very careful due to the fact that this is taxpayers money.<p>Furthermore, all the pains of startup chile are pretty well known. It is definitely not an accelerator, you will probably not have a lot of events and guidance. But, if $40k equity free capital and a reasonable amount of freedom (in how you use it..) are important to you - then sure, I think it's a program worthy of mention.<p>/ Just sick of all the whining that goes on about how Startup Chile doesn't connect you to the US blah blah blah.. -- why should it ? Also the sense of entitlement a lot of people carry is sickening.

The engineering companies I have worked at have been exclusively small tech companies. They're great. But most in the industry have constructed this idealization of the morally virtuous startup founder. Everyone likes free things, sure, but big companies at least seem to acknowledge the fact that they're inflating their profits at the cost to someone else. Small company culture doesn't do that. The AirBnB debate recently was a great example. People were decrying regulations that could undermine AirBnB, but it didn't even register to people that a lot of the ""value created"" by AirBnB was actually just costs that were shifted to the other residents of the building/surrounding community.<p>I see the same sort of thinking when patents come up on HN. There is this presumption of the morally virtuous innovator. Therefore, every $1 he must spend paying NPE's must be $1 of dead weight loss to society. There is no conception of the fact that some part of that $1 represents money he would rightfully have had to pay to the original patent holder, because (statistically!) he's not morally virtuous 100% of the time.",1340895825

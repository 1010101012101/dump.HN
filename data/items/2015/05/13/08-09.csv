But now you&#x27;ll need a &quot;bottom representation&quot;, which, even if it is easier to transform than machine instructions, will be pretty hard to decompile to another language. For example, most interesting lock-free algorithms require some sort of garbage collection; how do you describe that GC behavior, which doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to be general purpose, in a way that can be ported to both C and Go?)\nTheoretically it may be doable, but in practice the problem is very, very hard.<p>The big question, then, is why bother? The JVM already provides excellent interoperation with excellent performance that can cover the vast majority of (at least) server-side applications out there, and Graal/Truffle are extending the range of languages that the JVM can provide the fastest implementation for (it&#x27;s early days and it&#x27;s already pretty much on par with V8 when running JS, and faster than PyPy for Python). Those applications not within this profile range will use other languages (like C++), but those languages are already more expensive to develop in, and their developers happily pay more for more specialized algorithm implementations.<p>> Shared-memory cross-runtime distribution works too.<p>That&#x27;s true (provided both sides can agree on an ownership and concurrency behavior).",1431506750

I work mainly with Python, that has popular python-specific packaging tools, yet those tools cannot express dependencies of python libraries upon e.g. native libraries. The python-specific tools are convenient on a pure-python project, for multi-language projects it feels more like an anti-pattern than a solution, particularly if you end up having to use many different packaging ecosystems / tools.<p>I think google&#x27;s approach makes more sense in the context of an organisation where some kind of uniform approach can be imposed, and particularly where there are uniform approaches to code quality / test coverage / continuous integration.<p>To be clear -- I have never worked at google, this is my external perception.<p>I have worked somewhere where there are simultaneous software projects with wildly varying levels of code quality / test coverage / continuous integration, this does not seem to agree with very well with the source-control-based &quot;import from HEAD&quot; in one big repository.

VMs are Turing machines, after all. (In practice, the overhead can be surprisingly low; you don&#x27;t have to emulate what you can trace or dynamically recompile. The work around ASM.js is rich in data about how to squeeze performance out of the not-particularly-direct mapping of the C abstract-machine to the JS VM.)<p>The abstract machine formed by the language semantics can, of course, demand live support machinery of the underlying runtime (like a GC, say) that may have to be &quot;polyfilled.&quot; This is what we&#x27;ve been doing forever—a PIT signalling a processor interrupt which is checked for between each cycle is just a polyfill for having concurrent processes on other processors sitting in blocking-sleep for a bounded time, for example. Any hardware emulator is full of these. Usually you can find ways to make them less necessary—IronRuby doesn&#x27;t contain its own GC with Ruby semantics, it just translates Ruby&#x27;s GCing requirements into calls to the CLR allocator+GC and the result works &quot;well enough.&quot;<p>> Not only marshalling/demarshalling of data, but fanning-in and then fanning out your concurrency on each end.<p>Why are you assuming message-passing distribution? Shared-memory cross-runtime distribution works too. That&#x27;s how ZeroMQ works, for example.",1431505758

He was using it for complex aerobatics - high accelerations, very high turn rates, very little respect for the gravity vector.<p>You can&#x27;t do these sorts of things at all with human-sized helicopters - they&#x27;re not maneuverable enough.  In fact, the increase in maneuverability as high-powered single-rotor helicopters scale <i>down</i> is actually a problem for human reaction time.  Model helicopters conventionally used a mechanical flybar in order to make the helicopter less responsive to inputs and more controllable.  More recent innovations in flybarless electronics have enabled fly-by-wire control to substantially speed up responsiveness while still permitting stable flight when desired.<p>A single-rotor stunt helicopter is very different from a camera multirotor.  A 1.6m carbon fiber blade vs a (usually plastic) 0.1-0.4m blade.  A high-powered two-stroke engine vs a battery and motors.<p>And very importantly, the purpose of the two aircraft is entirely different.  This type of helicopter uses collective and cyclic pitch oscillations, and a rudder.  That&#x27;s a completely different control scheme than a normal multirotor, which uses differential thrust.  It lends itself to storing energy in the angular momentum of the blades at low collective pitches (running the rotor progressively faster while hovering), and then releasing it all in a maneuver by setting the pitch higher.  That means the flat, strong carbon fiber rotor blades can be travelling at a tip speed of 400mph or higher.  Even a very large camera-toting quadrotor is likely to have a (plastic, thin, bendy) rotor tip speed in the 100-150mph range - they&#x27;re optimized for hovering battery life, and differential throttle has limited maneuverability, and the slower & larger the better.  Being so much ligher per (disposable, easy to break) prop means that even at similar tip speeds the angular momentum is much diminished.<p>&quot;Video footage has emerged of Mr Pirozek, who was a world-recognised aerobatic flyer, putting his Trex 700 helicopter through a series of remarkable tricks, including one that involves dropping the $1,500 model out of the sky by turning off the engines and restarting them just before the model chopper hits his head.&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0wvXoZ9KYg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0wvXoZ9KYg</a><p>Lastly, &quot;beheaded&quot; seems to be a linkbait overstatement, and is considered dubiously by the medically inclined - even with all the power behind those blades, the skull is a very strong thing.

(Future-tech, remember.) You can see the potential for this in things like Erlang&#x27;s typer+dialyzer system.<p>Likewise, static analysis tools should be able to work on foreign code after transpilation. There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from transforming C code into Rust code in order to get the Rust compiler&#x27;s opinion on its ownership semantics.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not saying that there&#x27;s one universal underlying language semantics. Just that language semantics (which consist of such things as a type system, a threading/memory model, etc.) have no reason to be tied to either a particular syntax, or a particular VM. (Effectively, a language semantics forms an <i>abstract machine</i> that executes more or less efficiently on the substrate of any given VM. MRI Ruby is a direct substrate for Ruby semantics; IronRuby is less-clear substrate; etc.)<p>> those may significantly affect the suitability of an algorithm for a certain language<p>This is a problem of transparent distribution. I&#x27;ve been working on an Elixir DSL for writing Haskell &quot;inside&quot; Elixir for efficiency. The result is not a Haskell compiled module getting linked into the Erlang VM, but rather a separate Erlang-VM-managed Haskell &quot;application server&quot; being run as a port program. I foresee much more of this, and much more cleverness about it: writing code that compiles to a bunch of separate modules <i>for separate VMs</i>, which then form a micro-distributed-system all within a Docker container or somesuch.<p>Again, it&#x27;s not about eliminating the plurality of runtimes—it&#x27;s about rendering that plurality <i>moot</i>, abstracting it away from the perspective of the programmer and leaving it up to the implementation to decide how to optimize abstract-machine-to-VM allocation.<p>There&#x27;s no reason that you can&#x27;t have every language semantics available to any library, to use in any combination (this parameterized type system with that green-threading and this other GC, etc.) It&#x27;s just that, in so doing, you&#x27;re either transparently importing into your single runtime some virtualization layers for all the other abstract machines you&#x27;ve coded in terms of (somewhat like writing a Windows app on Linux by linking it to Wine), or you&#x27;ve let the Sufficiently Smart Code-generator go beyond the premise of having a single target platform.",1431504059

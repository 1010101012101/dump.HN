It's not a bad or unpleasant place, and parts of midtown are quite nice, but there's not much point in being here if you could be somewhere else.<p>If you're heading inland from SF you should (as someone else said) visit Lake Tahoe instead.<p>I don't agree with what other people are saying about trading in your car on something more economical. You're doing maybe three thousand miles, but it's spread over a six month period, making your total gas costs for the actual road-trip only a hundred odd bucks a month.

I'm sure this isn't the only capital this company will need so it makes it silly to split equity based on short term thinking.<p>I think also everyone will have to think as this is their idea too. If you had the initial idea, the inital idea will change.<p>Don't get trapped by short term thinking. Split the company three ways, get vesting and a 1-year cliff and then get on with it. Only then will your equity actually be worth something worth worrying about.<p>Good luck.",1212615276
209413,comment,209255,209255,0,0,marvin,,,"I don't think this is a bubble at all. It seemed ridiculous to me that 30-40 year oil futures were valued at 50$ a barrel when most scientific theories of oil production dictate a dramatic decline in worldwide production during the next few years. In fact, I played with the idea of speculating on the 10-year price of oil a few years ago, but my understanding of markets at the time was not good enough to realize that there was actually a thriving futures market. Gasoline can't be stored for more than a few months, and getting hold of and selling physical crude oil is probably more hassle than it's worth.<p>Perhaps the current development is a bit of an overcompensation..but not much of an overcompensation. The current price of oil is probably higher than is dictated by supply and demand, but when it comes to futures, a correction up has been in the coming for a long time. Unless all speculators are certain that we will have a dramatic increase in fuel-efficiency (on the order of 50% over the next ten years) across all markets that buy fuel, there is no hope that there will be an abundancy of oil in the future. Add this to the fact that China and India are expected to consume more oil in the future, and things look very different. I think what has happened is that speculators have finally realized this, and that the current price spike is caused by ""speculators"" correcting the price up to a realistic level. This is how markets are supposed to work, and no new laws or political hand-wringing will be able to do anything about it.<p>Saying that this is a bubble seems like wishful thinking. When politicians start investigations to check out whether this is the case, there should be reason to worry. Actual bubbles are rarely identified with this great unity. If they are so certain, why don't the ambitious politicians of the US short crude oil futures for a few billion dollars? I think that would be quite an interesting spetacle.",1212615246

209401,comment,208518,209362,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"The previous poster made a claim about poor students in high-quality schools. I thought it was an interesting claim given that there have been experiments to that effect. Someone who says ""If X, I bet Y!"" should be happy to hear that ""Someone tried X -- do you know if they got Y?""<p><i>You are “giving up” at the point when you “give up” on doing better than a minimum wage job with no high school degree.</i><p>You're not ""giving up"" on the workforce when you stay in school? Also, are you ""giving up"" on school if you don't pursue a BA? An MA? A JD? A PhD? A postdoctoral position? A professorship? Tenure? A Nobel? Fields Medal? When you say that they ""give up"" you imply that they don't do something because it's too hard -- I'd rather say that they do the right thing, which happens to be the easy thing. I've ""given up"" on being a novelist, or an athlete, or a mathematician, or a drug lord, because I don't have the skills for that job.<p>I like how well your link controls for the possibility that smart people pursue higher education. I eagerly await the Center for Public Education's (they're neutral, too!) report on how height income, because most people under five feet tall don't even bother to join the labor force.<p><i>I believe that a high school education is valuable in itself, beyond financials.</i><p>Okay. There are lots of things that I think are valuable, but that I don't insist you pay for. If you're spending huge amounts of other people's money, you probably owe them some assurance that it's not just because it sure would be nice to have what you're buying (regardless of cost?) but that they will get their money's worth.<p><i>If we’re going to have a democracy, it would be nice to have voters have some idea of what’s what.</i><p>And they're learn this from government schools? How many teachers will tell kids that their government is horribly inefficient, or that their country has veered far from the values that its founders fought and killed for? Your argument might be persuasive in general, but I'm opposed to democracy so it doesn't sway me in particular.",1212614367

If you ditch the truck, you'll also have a much easier time driving and parking in the cities -- parallel parking in downtown anywhere can require some dexterity. Look for a used Civic hatchback or similar.<p>While you're in San Diego, you can go a certain distance into Mexico for a day trip occasionally without much commitment -- Ensenada, easy. Hotels are easy enough to come by that you can head further south for a weekend or so, to see more of Baja (maybe San Felipe). You'll notice that the further you get from the border, things get less sketchy and more interesting. I only mention it because you started by mentioning you'd like to see ""something else"", and you can definitely cover more than the U.S. west coast in 6 months.<p>Another day trip from Long Beach that probably wouldn't occur to you: Take a boat to Catalina Island with some friends, rent bicycles, get blitzed, eat sushi.

I was home-schooled for about half of my K-12 education, part of that included time on the computer during ""school hours"", and I was also given time on the computer after school - in moderation. As a result, I have a distinct love of the things that is not shared by my siblings who did not receive a similar education. So, since I am a (hopefully) competent systems administrator and programmer, I think that my experience on the computer as a child benefited me.

So yes, he could challenge it during opposition.<p>As indicated by the USPTO TESS Database, the mark was filed on April 9, 2013, but it hasn&#x27;t even been processed, let alone registered by the US PTO [5]. This means that the opposition period hasn&#x27;t come yet. That means that oh yes sirree, Turner definitely has a chance to oppose this mark! And oppose he will. And win he will. So, nothing lost here. A TM symbol confers no rights to the claimant other than common law rights, which Turner has a pre-existing claim on.<p>But he wouldn&#x27;t even need to challenge it - a subsequent registration does not entitle ownership for pre-existing marks.

Some people when afforded the power to eavesdrop on anyone can and will focus on what they percieve to be existential threats. Existential is the key word. When Hoover focused on Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, he viewed them as existential threats to the United States. We today viewed that as extremely misguided, but at the time he and many others in power agreed that we should monitor and debase those &quot;existential threads&quot;. The industrial food lobby considers animal rights activists existential threats. The administration views journalists as existential threats to their ability to defend against existential threats. Defense spending proponents think people that are anti-defense spending to be existential threats. The fact that the NSA is heavily Mormon, means that many people in the NSA may hold the same opinions about existential threats as the Mormon church. Many fundamentalist churchgoing folk consider gay marriage to be an existential threat. It is precisely because every individual has different views on what are and are not existential threats to the United States that we created a Bill of Rights that protect against the prosecution of existential threats that are merely the opinion of one individual and not the collectively opinion of the citizens of the United States.<p>The entire system of checks and balances was created because of this distrust of the &quot;moral compass&quot; of any single individual or signle in-group. When an individual or in-group can unilaterally monitor the communications of other individuals or in-groups with out due process, it all starts to fall apart.<p>There should be no secret court. There should be due process. There should be court appointed warrants not rubber stamps.

I will grant that it isn&#x27;t easy to study for and pass a data structures grilling that can last all day (or longer), even if you have studied for a month.  Anyone who can do this is at least capable of writing and understanding fairly complicated code.<p>But you are absolutely right that this may lead to &quot;false positives&quot; as well... they may simply be hiring people who are great at studying for and passing algorithms quizzes.  This certainly doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll be successful.  In fact... well, you&#x27;ve essentially pointed this out, but what does it say about a motivated and creative person that he or she will drop everything in order to study for something with only passing relevance to the number of projects he or she would like to be pursuing?<p>Well, desperate, I suppose, could be one of the motivating factors.  But how many top programmers are desperate?  Many would be interested in working for google, but aren&#x27;t desperate enough to put aside the interesting things they&#x27;d like to be working on in order to spend a month preparing for an exam on red-black trees.<p>Maybe this article suggests google may be coming around to realizing that they are doing some harm to their hiring efforts with this approach to technical interviews?",1371847839

5920829,comment,5918881,5920157,5,0,rayiner,,,"> (another example - recent public outcry about drone killing of Americans was easily put down by switching attention to the alleged fact of existence of the &quot;strict designation and targeting rules&quot; the government follows without even publishing the rules, just a mere statement of their existence)<p>As a technical U.S. citizen, Anwar_al-Awlaki had due process rights. Therefore, the relevant inquiry was: what process is &quot;due&quot; (M-W: &quot;owed,&quot; &quot;capable of satisfying [an]... obligation,&quot; &quot;required or expected...&quot;)? It&#x27;s a foundational principle of Constitutional law that &quot;due process&quot; does not necessarily require a jury trial. So the legality of al-Awlaki&#x27;s targeted killing depends entirely on the issues you dismiss out of hand. The fundamental question is whether the designation and targeting rules are sufficient &quot;process&quot; (meaning &quot;legal procedure&quot;) in context.<p>Far from being a &quot;responsibility deflection schema&quot; it is a good faith attempt to stay within the bounds of the law while still following through with an important governmental objective: bringing to justice an enemy of the United States. It&#x27;s no different than when any person or company asks their lawyer &quot;can we do this?&quot;<p>Because here is the thing: not everybody agrees with you (you, VladRussian2 personally). Lots of people think your ideals are stupid and dangerous.[1] Outside the echo-chamber of this website, lots of people have no problem with torture in the course of war, lots of people think supposed &quot;Americans&quot; who take up arms against the U.S. can&#x27;t claim the protection of their Constitution. Is the government just supposed to go by principles? If so, why your principles instead of other people&#x27;s principles? It&#x27;s not a workable system. That&#x27;s why we instead follow rules, rules we all agreed to. In the course of following those rules, we often have to make judgment calls about exactly what those rules do and do not allow us to do. And sometimes, we&#x27;re on the edge of that boundary and make good faith attempts to stay on the right side.<p>[1] I remember as an undergraduate in Atlanta in the lead-up to the Iraq war, lots of people seriously suggested turning the middle east into a &quot;glass parking lot&quot; as a solution to the problems in the region. You may not like those people (and I personally found those comments tasteless), but they are as much a part of our body politic as you, and their principles carry just as much weight as yours.",1371847003

5920755,comment,5919058,5920501,26,0,betterunix,,,"The problem is that our legal code has ballooned, and needlessly so.  We tend to react to any bad news with, &quot;Pass a law so it will not happen!&quot;  Americans often do not bother to reflect on whether or not such a law is even compatible with a free society or with our constitution.  That is not how things are supposed to work.<p>Sex offender registration and housing restrictions are an excellent example.  Megan&#x27;s Law was passed in response to an exceedingly rare crime, and everything we know about child sex abuse suggests that it is a stupid law (most of the time, it is someone close to the child, not a mysterious stranger).  The regulations on where sex offenders are allowed to live have resulted in colonies of homeless sex offenders (which can be a parole violation).  These laws are almost all ex post facto laws, but the courts are willing to perform all the mental acrobatics necessary to justify their constitutionality.  We wind up with stories about 19 year olds who had sex with 17 year olds winding up on the registry, or even guys who urinated in public.<p>Yet that has been the pattern in American law for my entire life.  Someone died because they overdosed on some new drug at a party, and suddenly the drug is illegal.  Someone put a high-capacity magazine in a gun and shot dozens of people, and suddenly high-capacity magazines are illegal.  Someone bullies a middle schooler on Myspace to the point of suicide, and &quot;online bullying&quot; becomes a crime.<p>The second problem with these sorts of laws is that <i>they never expire</i>.  Legislators are never forced to debate old laws, even if the laws no longer make sense.  Cocaine was made illegal because members of Congress were told that black men became unstoppable monsters, more accurate with a pistol, and more prone to attack white women -- and in the century that has followed, nobody has bothered to renew that debate and see if that line of reasoning still makes sense.  Virginia recently took a rare step and <i>repealed a law</i> that made it illegal for an unmarried heterosexual couple to live together (though plenty of other moronic laws remain on the books there).  Maybe it made sense to make it illegal to dig for arrowheads, but without debating it now, how do we know that it still makes sense?<p>We should live in a society where no reasonable person has to worry about whether or not they are breaking the law.  That means we need our laws to expire periodically, so that we keep debating whether or not they make sense, and that means we need to not just pass laws every time someone happens that we do not like.",1371846160

I tend to break it into Goals/strategies/tactics, though there are other useful breakdowns. I.e. start by asking yourself &quot;what is my goal&quot; - and it is not to ask graph algorithm questions, to use Django, or whatever. Once you have your goals, you can with hard work come up with strategies. From there flow tactics. Then, this gets communicated and everyone latches onto the strategies and tactics, never asking if the goals have changed, or are inappropriate for your use. Google wants to hire a bunch of young people that know graph theory  and are willing to do anything to work for you (they have graph theory problems after all). Asking grad level CS questions is a way to get those people. So every start up follows suit even though they need something completely different, and Google persists even when they need something different.<p>OO solves some things well, and is an appropriate strategy for some situations. It does not follow that you should use OO for everything.

Agile, Jira, and all that has become the goal, and you are not allowed to think about whether it makes sense or not in a given situation. Decisions are judged on whether they are &quot;agile&quot;, not on whether they are the best way to accomplish something.

Neither is a good thing, but there is a strong different, especially in terms of legality and trauma.<p>Men and women have unwanted sex all the time. They do it because they don&#x27;t want to let their partner down, because they think it is their &quot;job&quot;, because they want to get something, because they are bored, because they want to feel wanted, because they just want to feel loved, because they haven&#x27;t in a long time, etc. -- not always the best reasons. Typically, those feelings can be resolved in other ways.<p>We, as lovers, should strive to reduce the number of unwanted sex events as possible, and to do so requires an open bidirectional communication channel.

So, understanding how someone might go about doing that seems reasonable on its surface.<p>But in fact, I&#x27;ve met too many consultants who seem inclined to build &quot;castle in the air&quot;, spinning market details about theoretical markets without properly defining either the product or service or the buyer of that product or service. And since they are for markets for which there is by definition no solid data (since that is why the consultant was asked to size it in the first place), their estimate is never validated (or if it is, it is so long after they have left that they never hear about.)<p>At the same time, no one ever seems to mind if the answer to such questions is off by a country mile when the actually size of the market is known, so long as the thought process was rigorous and shows the right kind of logical decomposition of the problem. But this justification for the value of the question also bothers me, as it seems to be testing more whether you can come up with convincing-sounding bullshit than whether you can correctly estimate a given value. This, again, may be an accurate measure for whether someone can become a consultant, but I never liked the notion that we should judge people on how well they can spin bullshit.<p>Finally, the question seems to also be gauging the interviewees willingness to &quot;play along&quot; with what an interviewer is asking. The questions are often on seeming random topics (piano tuners in New York or gas stations in Wisconsin), and are often not directly related to the domain. In the real real world, you would actually probably find a list of such things on the internet, or conduct some basic research that can be done to answer such a question. Or the correct response might be something like, &quot;We can make a rough estimate, but without more solid data than a few random facts which we&#x27;ve rubbed together to come up with a market size, maybe we shouldn&#x27;t be pursuing this market&quot;. In which case, the contrived example serves to allow the interviewee to demonstrate that they are the type of person who will enthusiastically pursue whatever random intellectual exercise they have been assigned by the interviewer, so long as there is a chance of getting the interviewers approval.<p>All of the things that the question tests for, then, seem to not be characteristics you would actually want in someone if they were to answer the question in the real world. In the real world, you might do a back of the envelope calculation, sure, but you would also do a lot of research on the internet, conduct a lot of interviews and surveys, and/or conduct evaluations of competitors to understand and size a market.",1371845447

Try before you buy has been around forever.  If they are moving these consultants around to different companies to find a match, that is somewhat unique.  Just placing someone into a contract-to-hire role until the not hire/hire decision is made is not new.<p>I like contract-to-hire overall, but one problem is that you get lifetime contractors who have no intention of ever converting to perm roles, and they just stay as long as they can.  Companies are more inclined to invest in and train a contract-to-hire employee over a pure contract employee.  The brain drain can be a problem.<p>Another issue is contract-to-hire employees usually are paid a premium, and get accustomed to the money, making them less apt to convert.  This is particularly troublesome for those that get their benefits through their spouse/partner, where the extra money seems substantial because they aren&#x27;t paying for benefits or COBRA out of it.<p>Probationary periods are rather useless in any at will employment state (in the US, not sure about international law).  Why put &quot;We can fire you in 90 days if you don&#x27;t perform&quot; in an employment contract when you can simply fire someone on day 2 if you really wanted to?

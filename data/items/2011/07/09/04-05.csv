2745055,comment,2744583,2744583,2,0,nxn,,,"I agree with two things:<p>1) Bringing touch based user interfaces/behaviors to the desktop is not going to work when the keyboard and mouse are the means of operating them. For desktops I don't see the mouse and keyboard going away since I would not wish to spend as much time as I do in front of a computer with my arms extended out the whole time (or at all actually). The only reason why I'd see doing this would be in hopes of having one OS run on different types of devices and therefore having the need to support multiple modes (IE: the win8 reason).<p>2) Limiting your calendar/contact apps to look like the physical objects they're meant to replace is an incredibly bad idea. The whole point of going digital was to remove constraints and make performing tasks easier through the freedom of not being stuck within the confines of paper. Where's the advantage now? More intuitive apps? Were the majority of users not able to figure out how to use the old calendar app? Why do I feel like more people just wont use it now because it will be too tedious to perform tasks they became used to with the previous versions?<p>Not to mention this makes it look like it was intended for elementary school students. OS X had the advantage of having a very clean and professional look to it that I am sure won it a lot of customers before. I mean I get ill looking at ANY Windows text editor (since they all seem to come with like 50 icons spread out over 5-10 different toolbars), but if the alternative is an app that has a giant crayon for a cursor -- because that's so intuitive -- I'll still stick with Windows.",1310187511

Union starts off by making a copy of 'a' and adds the elements of 'b' to it, rather than creating a new object and adding the elements of both.<p>On a hunch that PyPy's implementation would be less special-cased, I installed PyPy and and it actually does print ""Init!"" on ""c = a | b"".

I'm by marriage related to a recently retired NBA player employed by the league with the job of giving retarded simple advice about keeping out trouble and paying taxes, and so forth.<p>Anyway, the color of this problem of stupid decisions with large pro sports salary money is black. The cause is the disintegration of the black nuclear family. If a dumb white kid makes it big in baseball or the NFL, <i>some</i> reasonably successful uncle or cousin will come out of the woodwork to offer good advice. The dumb black kid, with just a mom and no functional extended family, will be prey to all kinds of hucksters.<p>There's plenty of literature about how these athletes lose their money: they get taken by local businessmen on deals for things like car washes and restaurants. They don't know how to value a business and they don't trust national financial markets, so they get soaked by local operators who trick them into trusting.",1310184756

I'm sure you're good at consulting and it's clear from the way you write that you're excited to finally get paid what you're worth for a change.<p>I'd just hate to see you wake up in a few years in a very similar situation as you were in as a salaryman.<p>It sounds like you're significantly increasing your cost of living: new apartment, getting married, treating money differently (""whats $2k when my comfort is on the line""), etc. If you're not careful you're going to <i>need</i> to consult full time just to get by. Good bye startup. No time for that. Your new wife quit her job six months ago and that new car isn't going to pay for itself.<p>My advice: put off the enjoyment of making real money and get back to <i>investing</i> time in AppointmentReminder or something else that will pay big scalable dividends.<p>That's what I'd say if we were having coffee :-)",1310184631

For example, Coca-cola might do that on a manufacturing system that controls the quantities and timing of the raw ingredients to produce the formula and is evidence only that they want to protect it.

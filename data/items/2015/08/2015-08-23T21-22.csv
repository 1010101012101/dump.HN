If it is given away, with or without strings attached, there is no direct way for the developers to be remunerated for their effort.   Open source might encourage a few companies to contribute to projects, but that only pays the developers of that software who are employed by those companies.<p>Private individuals, or non-profit institutions, can still use shared source software.   A few might be put off if they think it won&#x27;t help them to find a job, but even they will think twice if companies start paying to use it.<p>Having popular software is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t pay the bills if you can&#x27;t charge for it.",1440367091

One particularly irksome example for me (as a former architect) is the word &#x27;design&#x27;. When a software engineer says design he means css essentially, making it visually pretty. Whereas in architecture / engineering / industrial design etc. &#x27;Design&#x27; means.. everything, the overall <i>design</i> or plan of your entire system.
Thats just one small example that gets my goat up, there are tonnes more!<p>ps. The votey (red button which you click for another little panel) is particularly good for that smbc!<p>pps. Also as a game developer I reckon I&#x27;m safe using the term realtime if somethings being calculated at 60fps :)  ie. realtime shadows vs. baked ones.

Then it is up to the Immigration Bureau to weigh that risk against the right to asylum. Many remain in the country,” Sjöö remarked.
Excuse me? Oh yes. In this country, even an internationally red-flagged terrorist can be granted asylum. By the bizarre Swedish logic, a person at risk of “inhumane” treatment or death sentence in his home country qualifies for protection.</i><p><i>And as for terrorists? Open doors and open hearts.

At least 20 internationally known terrorists were granted asylum in Sweden in 2014 alone, which is a problem for Denmark too considering its capital Copenhagen being only 20 minutes away from Malmö, one of the immigrant hotbeds.
The capital of European ISIS recruitment remains Gothenburg, however. Sweden’s second largest town produces more ISIS-fighters than the entire United States.

10106817,comment,10103276,10104576,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,">The counting itself steals cycles<p>An atomic increment/decrement takes so little time as to make this irrelevant. If you&#x27;re in such a tight loop that you care about a single increment when calling a function (to pass a parameter in), you should have inlined that function and preallocated the memory you&#x27;re dealing with.<p>I&#x27;m talking about general use of smart pointers, which means that there&#x27;s a function call involved with the smart pointer value copy, and throwing an increment in is trivial by comparison.<p>>whichever module happens to drop the last reference to an object which is the last gateway to a large graph of objects<p>When writing games, I don&#x27;t think I ever had a &quot;large graph of objects&quot; get dropped at some random time. Typically when you drop a &quot;large graph&quot; it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re clearing an entire game level, for instance. Glitches aren&#x27;t as important when the user is just watching a progress bar.<p>And you can still apply &quot;ownership semantics&quot; on graphs like that, so that the world graph logically &quot;owns&quot; the objects, and when the world graph releases the object, it does so by placing it on the &quot;to be cleared&quot; list instead of just nulling the reference.<p>Then in the rare case where something is holding a reference to the object, it won&#x27;t just crash when it tries to do something with it. In this rare case a release could trigger a surprise extra deallocation chain, as you&#x27;ve suggested.<p>If that&#x27;s ever determined to be an issue (via profiling!) you can ensure other objects hold weak references to each other (which is safer anyway), in which case only the main graph is ever in danger of releasing objects -- and it can queue up the releases and time-box how many it does per frame.<p>Honestly having objects reference each other isn&#x27;t typically the best answer anyway; having object listeners and broadcast channels and similar is much better, in which case you define the semantics of a &quot;listener&quot; to always use a weak reference, and every time you broadcast on that channel you cull any dead listeners.<p>Aside from all of that, if you&#x27;re using object pools, you&#x27;d need to deallocate thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of objects in order for it to take enough time to glitch a frame. Meaning that in typical game usage you pretty much never see that. A huge streaming world might hit those thresholds, but a huge streaming world has a whole lot of interesting challenges to be overcome -- and would likely thrash a GC-based system pretty badly.",1440365565

It was a California car (with no rust which is rare here in central PA) and the paint was horribly faded but completely intact.  As an 18 year-old, I couldn&#x27;t fathom spending $2000 on a car with a blown engine.  Now that I&#x27;m a bit older, and have rebuilt several cars from scratch, I wish I&#x27;d taken the plunge - back then you could rebuild a VW or Porshe engine for well under $500 in parts.",1440364734
10106769,comment,10104949,10104949,0,0,tfigment,,,"Don&#x27;t want to write a real post but my most memorable simple story was with a C optimizing compiler.  I was using a something like struct Item { char name[12]; int flag; } with code that would would use this in a btree and use memcmp(x,y,sizeof(Item)) for ordering.  The name could be non-unique but name+flag would be and give specific ordering.  To fill Item I used something like (much simplified):<p><pre><code>  x = (Item*)malloc(sizeof(Item));
  memset(x->name, 0, 12); 
  strcpy(x->name, name);
  x->flag = flag;
</code></pre>
So the bits after name are now significant in compares but expected to be zero because of memset.  Well the optimizer would effectively remove the memset in release builds due to the strcpy so the code worked most of the time in release but would occasionally break because the bytes after the null terminated name could be anything and would only come into play when name was the same for 2 items.",1440364722

10106759,comment,10103276,10103276,0,0,geophile,,,"I was thinking about why I liked SNOBOL4/SPITBOL so much. The bizarre syntax and control structures appealed to me for some reason. If you haven&#x27;t used the language, each statement can succeed or fail. At the end of the statement, you can optionally specify a goto target for success and for failure. There are no higher level control structures that I remember (except for functions), so indenting is not something you (OK, I) normally did. This resulted in very clean looking source code, for some reason. I just remember that impression very strongly. But that doesn&#x27;t really explain the appeal completely.<p>The string processing is fantastic -- extremely powerful. I think regexes have a lot of the same power, but I always found SNOBOL4 more readable after the fact, when I had to go back and read and fix my own code. But that&#x27;s not it either.<p>I think the main reason I liked SNOBOL4 so much was that it was the first dynamic language I used. Values have types, variables do not. That was a big revelation. I don&#x27;t think I actually exploited it very often, but it was a cool new idea. And the absence of type declarations also contributed to the sense that the code looked clean. Automatic memory management was also very nice. I had spent a lot of time dealing with memory management in C. I must have in Pascal also. And I really don&#x27;t remember what Algol-W did for memory management -- a free or delete statement maybe? And of course in FORTRAN, COBOL, and BASIC, there was no dynamically allocated memory at all, so you had to guess high, keep track, etc. Not having to worry about tracking memory was a nice change.",1440364477

Note that some inside corners have darkening, and some don&#x27;t, depending on how they&#x27;re lighted.[1][2]<p>Full radiosity renderers are slow. The image is rendered over and over again, each pass using the previous result, with all surfaces now being light sources. Each pass thus shows the result of light being reflected one more time.  The corner-darkening effect comes from indirect lighting from the opposite face, an effect which gets smaller as you approach the corner.  With some renderers, you can watch the passes, as the image changes from starkly lit to very realistic. Render farms for movie production spend most of their time doing just this.<p>Game hardware cannot yet do true radiosity in real time, so there are many ways to fake it.

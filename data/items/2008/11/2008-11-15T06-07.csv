I ask because it seems that experience and the right people aren't sufficient conditions, and that picking up the books requires motivation from the first two sources. I ask partly for curiosity, and partly so, if it is the attitude someone around you conveyed, I can cultivate the same in myself and encourage those around me to become the first type.",1226731752

365191,comment,364747,365090,0,0,azanar,,,"It demonstrates a conflict of priorities between you and most of those around you, if my rather unscientific gathering of data is tending toward the true mean.<p>It demonstrates a desire to improve and understand, both toward  yourself and toward those who you ask ""why?"". Superficially, improvement is a good thing, and worth the devoting of a lot of rhetoric. But it comes with a lot of extra work, and with the admission that the way things are done now aren't optimal. So, it rubs people who are either lazy, apathetic, or egotistical entirely the wrong way. You'll also chaff indirectly those who are authoritarian in nature, and put faith in the management above; it's the same reason people get irritated when you question their deity's righteousness. If they're coworkers, they'll get spiteful; you're making more work for them now, and it either doesn't occur or doesn't matter that it means less drudgery later. If they're up the management chain, they'll wave authority in your face; it's the easiest way to short-term tranquility and an ability not to adopt a similar change ready attitude.<p>This is not an endorsement; just a reflection. This is the way it seems to be, but it doesn't have to be a truism you just begrudgingly accept. Being unpopular doesn't mean you're doing the wrong things, and jeopardizing your future and well-being. Maybe at BigCorp, but how long before misery and desire to do better would drive you away anyway?<p>Long reflection, sorry. But I hope this helps answer the why, and I hope your question was not rhetorical. ;-)",1226731222

Preaching the supremacy of everything Apple to the choir of Hacker News is a good karma-building tactic, but if you want to base your claims on inconvenient truths like <i>software revenues</i>, you'll find that Microsoft is more successfully resisting commoditization of software than every other company on the planet. Apple isn't even in the same ballpark.",1226729889
365179,comment,364245,364565,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"The comparison to Apple is apt. Back in their heyday, Sun combined the right hardware and software into a product that was perfect for the market, first scientific workstations, and then high end servers, in both cases, best of breed, premium priced, huge moneymakers. I don't know how you get back there, because they seem tremendously unfocused. But Apple was there once too - in the doldrums, failing to perform, all over the map. And they came back.",1226729872
365178,comment,364747,364897,0,0,azanar,,,"I've had the benefit of similar illumination where I'm employed, although without the same level of patience. The same explanation was given time and again there, too; incurred technical debt due to prudence. They were small, and thus didn't have the financial wherewithal to afford a long term outage should some of that debt sudden become subject to a margin call, and so I dug deeper. And from that the true reason came out of why things had gone off the rails so bad. The political history of the company had been one where ego and authority ruled. The technical debt would not be repaid, because it would be an admission that the incurring of such debt was not <i>inevitable</i>. It would be a sign that one or more wrong decisions was made. And, due to the history of authority rule, no one would dare question the decisions, assuming both that the management was approaching the situation with full information and rationality, and any one else should assume to have neither. From what I've gathered, I'm not so alone in the universe with these experiences. But when the term ""political history"" comes out to explain something, I'll generally start reaching for my fine tooth comb, to better understand who it matters to and why.",1226729774

The tech companies in CA are also very liberal -- both Google and Apple broke their informal policies to condemn the amendment. Hence, CA is still a great place to live for gay people.<p>In only a few years since prop 22, an amazing additional ~5% of voters switched their vote.

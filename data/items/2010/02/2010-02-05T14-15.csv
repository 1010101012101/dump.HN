The security model isn't just theoretically better -- OS X still doesn't randomize heap and stack addresses properly, for example.

1103631,comment,1103578,1103578,0,0,oneplusone,,,"Looking at the two examples you provided, I think your problem falls into two categories. Typography and colors.<p>Typography: The information hierarchy is not clear enough. In your second link the top section has near identical sizes and weights which makes it hard to see what is more important. I suggest you read The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst. It will teach you how to use type effectively and is a very good and interesting book.<p>You have way too much copy on the page. You need to make it interesting or people won't want to read it. Things like bulleted lists and pull-quotes will break it up a bit and add visual flavor.<p>Color: The colors you pick doesn't really work. In the first link the gray is way too dark and looks really dreary. In the second example the link, text, and header colors are so close together you can barely see the difference. They also don't really work well together. This is a matter of taste. Nobody can give you taste, its something you will need to develop.<p>Practice makes perfect really. Take a look at other websites and just observe which colors work well together. There are lots of little tricks you can use to make a minimalist site looks great. For one, don't use pure black for type. It shimmers on the page. Instead use a really dark gray. I personally use HSB(0, 0, 15).<p>Another thing you can do is to use HSB to pick your colors. Pick a single color you like, and then adjust the H slider to find a matching color. Its not perfect, but it works well enough.",1265381597

The point of a site like HN is not to create some kind of abstractly idealist ""level playing field"", but to provide content that people (me included) want to read.<p>Ultimately, you could disagree with what we do on the basis of ""fairness"" - but actually our system is <i>more</i> fair. There are many cases where someone brought up an excellent link that was from a site never before posted on HN, and/or posted by an unknown user. We're actually achieving the aim of fairness even more. Remember, this is an open channel, <i>everyone</i> (you included) is welcome to show up and be a part of it. There's no ""karma check"" at the front door. Hell, some people on #startups don't even have HN users.<p>Unlike the digg cabal that you compare us to, joining this channel requires only that you fire up your IRC client and join freenode#startups. And no one is under any obligation to vote up anything. Hardly a voting ring, I'd say.<p>I see us as an optimisation mechanism to help great content get to the front page - there's nothing dodgy about it at all. Which is why, unlike your earlier suggestion, I am not ""mad because you pointed out our little group"". I think it's bad form in general to post stuff from an IRC channel onto a public forum, but I'm not made of sugar either.<p>In fact, I'd say, please do join us there (and this applies to anyone reading this). We're a friendly bunch and very welcoming, and a lot of the most active HN users hang out there. Find us here:<p>chat.freenode.net:6667<p>Channel: #startups",1265381506

However, absent unemployment insurance, he would be forced to take whatever he could get, thereby shortening the recession.</i><p>This isn't a cut and dry argument either.  That said, it's the reason that some unemployment compensation packages include or are dependent on job placement services and/or retraining efforts.<p>If you simply provide people with moderate passive income, the likelihood that they'll use it to update their skill set and change the direction of their career depends on a whole host of variables (satisfaction at previous jobs, age, industry, amount and type of education, union membership, other cultural factors.)<p>As such, I'd agree that for some people, income without retraining or mandatory placement services has a deleterious effect, but this is in no way a universal phenomena.<p>The detroit auto worker is pretty much the poster child for the problem you cite.  This is because they tend to be on the wrong side of every variable I mentioned (low satisfaction, high age, salaried employment, a contract industry, relatively low formal education, higher vocational education, union members, and likely to be part of a generation that feels they are ""owed"" jobs.)<p>That said, their existence doesn't demonstrate that the programs are an overall drain, because they aren't representative of the average unemployed worker.

I was trying to be careful to say ""appears to be"" instead of ""is"" to leave this interpretive door open :)<p>As you say, the most common interpretation is that time itself slows down as you enter a gravity well, leaving all the physical constants the same (since their locally measured values will appear the same to you).<p>But if you look at things from an imaginary ""absolute"" viewpoint outside of spacetime, you could think of spacetime itself as a sort of fluid that's denser in regions of high gravity. Light travels more slowly in this denser fluid, and since epsilon zero is inversely proportional to the square of the speed of light, you could interpret it as being larger where gravity is higher.<p>I guess you can tell that fluid dynamics was always easier for me than differential geometry -- whenever I see a system of nonlinear partial differential equations (like general relativity), it's just easier for me to think of them this way.",1265379844

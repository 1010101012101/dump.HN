4174691,comment,4174550,4174550,0,0,mkmcdonald,,,"I'll play the cynic here and try to diagnose why this is even being considered.<p>jQuery is a very invasive API. Its goal is to steal all the work from the developer, and to ""guarantee"" what it deems to be ""correct"" input for a certain subset of browsers. This approach may ostensibly work, but inevitably falls apart, which leads to thousands of ""bugs"" being reported.<p>Because the API has grown to be so massive, goalposts ""must"" be moved in order to create a lighter API. Once again, this is because of a design flaw. Goalposts will continue to be moved in cyclical fashion unless an alternative design is used. Fellow developers may denigrate me for it, but I will explain how this problem can be avoided.<p>An API that tries to cater to everyone cannot and will not succeed. This is evidenced by the upcoming ""fork"". Conversely, an API that provides a set of tools to developers without catering can work in many environments. The burden is then placed upon the developer to choose which environments matter. As has been outlined by mobile developers, object inferences for IE 6 really are unnecessary for mobile Webkit environments. I have written here on this concept before, mostly on the topic of ""graceful degradation"". Browser specificity can and will kill a client-side API.",1340930717

But remember, FX rates are spot rates, they don't take into account the FX risk incurred by holding money <i>over time</i> in the foreign currency.  So it makes sense to for a US company to charge a premium to customers using a different currency.

They are, almost without a doubt, radioactive.<p>Why?<p>It's an old story, really:  Get tangled with Google algo's for any reason and your account is suspended with no recourse.  There goes everything: adsense, adwords, plus, gmail, drive, docs and whatever else was linked to that account.<p>No thanks.  Make a real commitment to behave like a real business partner with me and my clients and you have a deal.  Until then, thanks, but no, thanks.<p>Don't get me wrong, I would definitely like to use these services.  I most definitely do.  However, the risk of the totalitarian account suspension mechanism chopping your head off is just not worth my time.<p>Charge me $99 a year (think Apple).  Put me through the vetting process that Apple puts you through when you register as a developer (company data, etc.).  Get comfortable with the fact that I am a real business.  Then, from that point forward, let's have a real business-to-business relationship as opposed to a totalitarian-government-to-insignificant-ant relationship.  That's a winning formula.",1340928644

If the aspect ratio were such that the screen were a square (it's not), this would mean that a 10'' screen would be more than twice as large as a 7'' screen,  which would be three times as large as a 4'' screen.<p>That said, the screen size is really only part of the picture. At least for me, I like the size of the Kindle Fire (also ~7'') - it fits perfectly in my hand both when traveling and when reading. A 10'' screen to me feels massive enough that I'd just as rather have my computer (heck, 10'' is almost the size of some ultrabooks or the Macbook Air!)",1340928431

You completely fail to understand evidence based thinking and falsifiability and thus your opinions are not remotely rational, they are emotional.  You need to learn to stop trying to explain yourself, and start providing evidence that anything you say is true.  You just look like a crazy person to me; I doubt I'm alone in this assessment.<p>I'm not interested in your opinions of why you're right, I'm interested in evidence of your claims.

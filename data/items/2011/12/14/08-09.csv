An HBO/Comedy Central/other contract would also stipulate that he make the rounds of Conan O'Brien, Jay Leno, David Letterman, and numerous radio shows to promote the material. Those kinds of appearances are critical for expanding your fan base, since they give an essentially captive audience a chance to be exposed to a performer's material. Just look at his viral ""Everything's Amazing and Nobody's Happy"" routine that helped get a lot of his current fan base.<p>The point is, he hasn't even begun to do the type of promotion that he typically would be contractually obligated to do, yet he's already closing in on the amount he usually expects to make. This looks like a wildly successful experiment.",1323853086

Understand and identify market type:\na) Existing market: People know about the product, the problem it is solving.\nb) New market: Even if there are other players out there, it's still not commonly understood by customer why it matters<p>3. How to position yourself.\na) Existing market, you need a something different... this is what I ask myself:\n* Can I provide the same value for cheaper?\n* Can I provide more value for similar price?\n* Can I focus on a a subset of the market (e.g. niche), and adapt better to it?<p>b) New market: The challenge for new markets is not so much how 'good' the product is, but rather how good you are are explaning to customers why you matter. So I ask myself:\n* Can I make it simpler/more understandable?\n* Can I get better market adoption through my own techniques?<p>If I don't answer ""yes"" to any of those questions, I either rethink to idea so it fits one of those cases, or move on.

Expert level C++, some Python, interest in algorithms and machine learning.<p>I have multiple ideas, but one is head and shoulders above the rest. It's a killer game app for Facebook, which would generate revenue through user purchase of game tokens through Facebook Credits.<p>I looked into approaching Zynga, but they don't accept unsolicited ideas. Imagine that, being so big that you can no longer innovate because you're worried about legal issues. Anyway, there is something special about this game that I can't explain here. Am considering YCombinator application, but time is of the essence and my idea shouldn't sit still. Can't apply at YC right now, have to wait, so I'm putting this out there. Am I impatient? You'd be surprised how patient I am, but suddenly I AM impatient because this idea is just too good (and no, it's not something I thought of yesterday: it's 5 years in the making). Maybe I sound like Ralph Kramden (Honeymooners). Well, I'm not a bus driver, I make pretty good money, and I could easily keep on the track I'm on. But this idea is just TOO GOOD. I'm talking potential millions, life-changing money, all possible because of Facebook.<p>Despite what I may sound like, I'm not a salesman. But I will need one because this idea has 2 separate but intertwined approaches: the Facebook app, plus actual game events around the world and even a World Championship event. Think World Series of Poker.... expanded way beyond poker!<p>What I need is someone expert in the business of making things happen, preferably on Facebook, who can help get this idea in the right hands to develop it. Either that, or you can jump start development for Facebook yourself, immediately.<p>The candidate will have to sign a very strict NDA. No messing around here, again, we are dealing with life-changing money; not guaranteed, but very very very likely. I can say that because I've done a bit of research and put a lot of thought and refinement into this idea. If you or someone you know is very high level in the field of turning ideas into reality, and putting ideas into the right hands, we need to talk.<p>More related ideas where this one came from. So it won't just be a one-shot deal. I'm extremely creative (in addition to being a software engineer, I'm an amateur musician and artist, I strive to exercise every aspect of creativity).<p>If I don't get responses, I'll have to be patient and go the YC route. And I am prepared to do that for their summer 2012 schedule. But if you or someone you know wants to circumvent that and be in on a life-changing idea, willing to sign strict NDA, respond quickly. Must have verifiable credentials, the higher level the better. I'm just a senior software engineer with an idea, you or the person you know should be way above me, very credentialed, and ready to make money. Face to face interview will most likely be required, not at my expense, which means travel to midwest should be a trivial expense for you or the person you know.

But on the notion of self-centredness, I'm afraid I have to agree. From my own experience, coming through a massive clinical depression and coming through to the other end, cured, I believe self-centredness to be the very cause of depression. And not just depression, but every ailment in the world as we know it. The irony is, I can only see this NOW, with hindsight, looking back at my mindstate when I was depressed: ""ego all the way, me me me, MY problems, MY depression, MY past, MY MY MY MY..."" That very self-absorbed, self-centred fascination with my own ego and its agenda mindstate is exactly what kept me trapped in that depression for so long. It's only when I started to consider that maybe -- just maybe -- as one of the 6 BILLION people on this planet, other people had problems FAR WORSE than mine, that the clouds began to part. And when I realised that I was being very selfish and WASTING my life in a state of -- excuse me, but there are few better terms -- mental masturbation.\nAll I was doing was feeding my ego, indulging its little whims and woes, and feeling sorry for myself. What was I doing for humanity? Nothing. And yes, that is self-centredness in its highest -- or should I say lowest -- form.\nOf course, the great curse of the ever-nourished ego -- the root of all depression -- is that when you're IN that state, you CAN'T SEE it for what it is. It's like the people stuck in the Matrix (the film). They wouldn't believe it if you told them they were living in a dream. You have to wake up for yourself, then you see it.""\nJoshua Bryer",1323852209

But what sounds to me the most _genuine_ reason for suicide is someone who has contemplated meaning of life for long and hasn't been able to find any inherent reason why he should exist. That person may have friends, financially secure and may love having fun. But internally he may slowly realize the fact that his existence in this world is pointless. How do you call such suicide attempt as stupid? The person has clearly thought through it and decided not to exist.<p>This doesn't mean I personally endorse suicide. I am a big believer in Absurdism <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism</a> and think the whole point of life is to live in face of absurdity. The realization that you have to live (and it's OK even if you die because existence is pointless after all) gives you incredible power. You are no longer afraid of doing things like quitting your job, talking to girls in a bar, going sky diving and trying drugs. After all, no matter what happens, you have nothing to loose. We all are going to die one day, so why not die _after_ doing whatever your heart desires.",1323849802

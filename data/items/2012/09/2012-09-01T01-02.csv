I'm pretty sure that most journalistic organizations these days know what's going on and just don't want any of it to come to light unless some other organization forces the issue, in which case they then do everything they can to throw the person under the bus.",1346464689

4462429,comment,4460122,4461661,2,0,yojimbo311,,,"I get the impression that a lot of the anti-Apple camp get the same sense about people who ""support"" the decision, and I use that term loosely. I'd like to offer the following:<p>Apple has been consistent in actively defending any design element, hardware or software, they feel is uniquely identifiable as Apple. This has always been about brand identity, but something so amorphous and difficult to regulate have few tools to protect them so instead the fights focus on technicalities. A patent here, a copyright there, a trademark, whatever. It's always fun to point and laugh at the specifics, but it's the bigger overall picture at play that's defining the actions, not the actions themselves. Long debates exist over whether the ends justify the means ect. so no need to get into it here.<p>Samsung is just the latest in this trend and sort of the current poster child of businesses who's modus operandi is mimicking the successful designs of market leader products (whether it's software, hardware, appliances, whatever) and offering them at lower costs to cannibalize (couldn't think of a better word) the market as much as possible. There's nothing explicitly illegal about it since they aren't 100% knockoffs, but they skirt a very fine line, and I, like many others, seem to find it a morally detestable practice which can have a negative long term impact on the market and can debatably hurt consumers in ways they aren't always aware of. (apologies, still looking for a source on this).<p>I think you'll find that most people who support the decision also agree that the need to weaponize a patent on an arguably questionable ""innovative UI"" in order to convince a bad actor to stop copying other people's work is absurd and has a serious chilling effect that can hurt more than it can help. IANAL, but my feeling is that if the market is significantly large enough scale the tools available that would be more appropriate to use don't carry enough weight behind them to create an equally compelling incentive to ""play fair"". Many companies seem to be resorting to using patents, copyright, and trademark instead to create an incentive compelling enough to negotiate some sort of mutual agreement (forced or otherwise). I think we can all agree that this activity is an abuse of those ""protections"" and a very compelling argument to have a good long look at them and determine what positive and negative motivational forces they create. However, while two wrongs don't make a right, it doesn't negate the fact that there is a genuine grievance in this case where the systems, as they currently exist, have not been able to resolve without heavy dependance on technicalities that taken individually may not mean much to the original issue. This is at least how I've personally been able to rationalize the disparity I have of the two positions and I get the feeling from other ""supporters"" that something similar is going on.",1346464612

4462421,comment,4460398,4461389,9,0,momotomo,,,"There are a lot of schools of thought that address the paradox of short term sufferings involvement in the overall scheme of kindness. Buddhism refers to it as ""idiot kindness"" or ""idiot compassion"" if you're kind in the short term without considering the long term value of it.<p>True kindness is a long winded, structured and considerate thing. Feeding a junky drugs because it makes them feel better is an example of it done wrong, I would still entirely consider it kind and compassionate to will someone through a process such as what you've illustrated here if you had a genuine understanding that it was going to provide them these kind of benefits.<p>Clever and kind are never that clear or opposed in the sense of dichotomy. At the extremes of it maybe 'clever' looks like not helping people at all because it frees up resources for the rest of the community, or 'kind' is euthanasia. The subjectivity of it all is the integral, and hardest, part of the process of assessing what's 'best' for an individual.",1346464165

Think of all the companies you give personal information to.  Think of how much information you actually give them.  Think about what they are permitted to do with that information.<p>Then think about sending a list of all your friends, family,  colleagues, your personal thoughts and commnications on personal matters, to a random, characteristically anti-social CS major you've never met.  It's just plain weird.  And Zuckerberg was absolutely right in what he said: we're dumb to do it.  The problem is this didn't phase him one bit.  He went right ahead as if it was all going to be OK.  And we just kept sending him more and more info.<p>Granted, Facebook calls itself a company, and the situation has grown quite large and complex, but I still think of Facebook as one CS student's website.  It is what it is.<p>You send your personal info, in some cases more personal info than you would give your personal banker, your doctor, or your lawyer, through the web to total strangers, many of them are anti-social kids like Zuckerberg, to be posted on his website.<p>It's a disaster waiting to happen.",1346464046

After a while I stopped checking cpan for what I needed, since I just got angry.<p>Another difference: In the Perl world, you can find and have dependency trees with dozens to hundreds of modules installed from cpan -- and you expect it to work, particularly since the module tests by default are run at install. (It is a bit painful with too many dependencies, but it works if you need it.)",1346462987

(You can watch the videos here.) Not surprisingly, the professional athletes were far better at predicting whether or not the shot would go in. While they got it right more than two-thirds of the time, the non-playing experts (i.e., the coaches and writers) only got it right about 40 percent of the time.<p>""Newsweek:<p>""In the experiment, 10 basketball players, 10 coaches and 10 sportswriters (considered non-playing experts), and novices all watched a video clip of someone attempting a free throw. The players were better at predicting whether the shot would go in: they got it right in two-thirds of the shots they saw, compared to 40 percent right for novices and 44 percent for coaches and writers.<p>""Tellingly, Begley misstated the number of participants in the study. (There were only 5 coaches and 5 sportswriters, not 10 of each. In addition, there were also 10 people in the novice group who were neither coaches nor sportswriters.) Lehrer made the exact same mistake in precisely the same manner.""<p>When Lehrer reproduces someone else's mistake, you know he isn't looking up or verifying the facts himself. The honorable thing to do in a blog would be simply to link to Begley's piece and say, ""Sharon Begley wrote an interesting article a few years ago about a study on this issue.""<p>P.S.

With emacs I have an option M-x tab auto complete In case I don't get to remember something. I would like to know what are vim equivalents of this?<p>Some how I feel deep down inside that vim was not designed bottom for this kind of complexity. I mean to say when you want to design something to scale you have to clearly decide what goes into the core and what can be added using a extension system. Although I understand the spirit behind the use cases for vi when it was first invented to light weight. Now when you decide to stick to minimalism you must be consistent to that philosophy. When you violate that, you go on bolting stuff on top of it which doesn't belong there. The net result is a huge bloat of things which make usability too complex. Besides I only can commit so many things to memory.<p>One look at this cheat sheet made my head spin. Every time I fire up a editor to write code, I need brain space to think about the problem at hand. I can't afford to context switch between looking a up a sheet of command to do editor work. Which in case even Notepad will turn up to be more useful than this.<p>If someone has a better way to doing this I would be more than happy to learn. I keep hearing a lot of vim these days, and want to learn it too. But everytime I face the uphill task of memorizing something, I just drop it and go on to do something else.",1315559525

I was a bit jarred by your website being so dark.  The menu buttons were hard to find (hard being a relative term here, of course) because there was a lack of contrast.  And then the news page shocks the system again by being bright white.  On the blog page, the menu buttons go away (but they do not on any other page).<p>Usability things aside, am I guessing correctly that you are intentionally making the site very dark in order to say something about the light industry?  I don't quite get it... on a gut level I would have expected something crisp and beautiful maybe, in order to match the product (something maybe like <a href=""http://www.betterplace.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.betterplace.com</a> )",1227516568

374587,comment,374529,374554,0,0,neilk,,,"<i>Doesn't HTTP compression make minification largely unnecessary?</i><p>It depends. If you have really high traffic or you care about every last microsecond of responsiveness, minification is essential. Also, minifiers these days tend to know about scope and program structure and may even be able to figure out when you're referring to defined browser objects like 'window'. So you just get that much more bang for the buck when combined with other forms of compression.<p>As for your other question, about convention: back in the dark days of the mid-90s Javascript was just the subset of scripts that both IE and Netscape would support. Omitting semicolons usually caused horrible bugs in one or the other. Also, most tools for formatting source code assume that newlines are not significant, and may wrap, split, or join lines in a way that breaks the logic.<p>Anyway, most battles over source code standards end in the most explicit option winning. This case is no exception.<p>Your question is fair, considering that ECMAscript is standardized now. In principle, you could switch to a newline-terminated style, thus saving a whole extra character per line. (But that would be eliminated if you minified).<p>However, even today, I would guess that omitting semicolons risks breakage. Browser makers don't test much with newline-terminated scripts.",1227515659

I love coding and I'm a bit shocked that my questions suggest to you that I might have a sloppy coding style in general. :^) I agree that conventions and shared idioms are <i>extremely</i> important. My question is, ""<i>why</i> is this a convention?"", not ""why should we use conventions at all?"".<p>I'm all for adopting the semicolon convention myself, even in sole-programmer projects, if there are reasons for using it; that's basically why I asked the question in the first place. (And of course I adopt it if contributing to a project which already uses it - no need to rock the boat.) Things like minification are exactly what I'm interested in, although I was under the impression that HTTP compression does a better job than Javascript minifiers at solving the size problem. Obfuscation is, of course, another matter entirely.",1227515644

You can reduce size over the wire by as much as 30-80% by minifying and obfuscating (something like YUI or Dojo compressors do this).<p>Not having semi-colons risks a lot of code breakage. Doug Crockford's JSMin has an aggressive mode which always strips line breaks and another which doesn't to avoid breakage when semicolons don't exist.<p>Personally I would just say that if you don't use semi-colons you should think hard about why you code at all. I'm not the anal-retentive type but sloppy code isn't awesome. I would put this in the same category as naming variables $whatever or $x. If you've never picked up someones second hand project you may not appreciate why a pleasant coding style matters.",1227513768

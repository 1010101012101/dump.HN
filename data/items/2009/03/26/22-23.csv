If things get ""dumber"" for a while, a compensating circumstance is likely to arise.  Whether you view it as positive or negative is subjective; it will occur.<p>I don't take that on faith.  Rather, it's my prediction based on all the historical and scientific data and analysis we've accumulated.<p>What gives me some hope for our current circumstances and our own species, is that so far, as education and affluence rise, birth rates drop.  If we can use this to mitigate the pressure of increasing population against dwindling resources (including the health of ecosystems), perhaps we can reach a sustainable existence with regard to the earth and its ecosystems.  Our species' evolution will continue, but hopefully in a sustainable fashion.<p>Life has shown itself to be very pervasive, at least on this planet.  If we fill the world up with radiation, heavy metals, organic toxins, and whatnot, some forms of life will adapt to cope.  But I'd prefer that there not be such a large set back.  Not another ""great extinction"".  Life on the planet has reached an interesting level of complexity.  I'd rather see that continue on without interruption.  But then again, that is merely my subjective preference.",1238106808

I highly recommend you to read the book ""First Things First"", but basically it's about scheduling the big stuff first (literally blocking chunks of time in the calendar), and only deal with the today/soon/whenever tasks on the remaining time. It's not as simple as that, you need to read the book to actually apply it effectively, but I can tell you that I've been following it at least for the past 5 years and it has been extremely effective for me.",1238106654

I know others who say their changes take effect within a few minutes.  I get no direct answer other than ""we try to treat all of our customers equally.""<p>I think I draw a flag because I sell educational software, and they want to make sure that I'm not selling homework answers or term papers (or whatever they are worried about). I would benefit from some sort of flag that says they've checked me out N times, I'm probably good for the N+1st time (with maybe random checks afterwords).  Or let the ads run and check concurrently.<p>For example, I shop sometimes in a supermarket that lets me scan the items with a handheld scanner and pay at a self-checkout lane.  When I first started doing it, I was randomly (?--I assume) audited fairly frequently.  But after very many (over 8 months maybe?) honest check-outs, I haven't been audited in at least two months.

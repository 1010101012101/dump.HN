So it actually makes [some] sense that wireless protocols try to compensate for the behaviour of the transport protocol used by 90% of all data: TCP.",1413647946

It&#x27;s difficult to see in this first example, but this is, in fact, on its way to becoming a full fledged tourbillon movement. It&#x27;s much easier to see in this Instagram video of the next revision:<p><a href=""http://instagram.com/p/uRAeIImfNx/?modal=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram.com/p/uRAeIImfNx/?modal=false</a><p>In the first revision, the movement rests on its cage, but if you look closely, you can see that the balance wheel, escapement wheel, pallets, and lever are all mounted internally to the cage (on separate plane). This is what makes this a tourbillon escapement. In a non-tourbillon movement, any of these components might be mounted to the front or back plate. This would prevent them from rotating.<p>The key distinction is that this movement can be held by its fourth wheel and operated by applying pressure to the cage. This is how most tourbillon movements operate. The barrel from the mainspring actuates the drive train, which in turn drives the cage. The fourth wheel remains stationary, which you can also see in this video from the author:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSGHKRrkvFg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSGHKRrkvFg</a>",1413647874

8475583,comment,8475215,8475215,0,0,lambda,,,"So, this is actually more about &quot;your writing system, and legacy encodings of it, suck.&quot;<p>While we do still have to support legacy encodings, increasingly we should just be using a universal encoding that doesn&#x27;t have all of these problems he mentions. UTF-8 is such an encoding; it is ASCII compatible, contains no nulls, has the usual ASCII control characters encoded the same, no shift sequences, if you jump to an arbitrary byte in the middle of a text there is a maximum number of bytes you need to go forward or backwards to find a character boundary and you can do so with no ambiguity, etc.<p>And a large portion of the writing system suck rant has to do with Chinese (hanzi/kanji/hanja) characters, because there are just so many of them and standardizing them is a fairly difficult process. And it&#x27;s true; that writing system does suck. It may have some good points, but it&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;s still in use, it would be enormously economically beneficial to move to a simpler, easier to learn writing system.<p>Of course, if you did that and people no longer learned the older, much more cumbersome and complicated system, they would lose access to a large number of older cultural works which do use it, so it&#x27;s a pretty tough sell.<p>Just to note, Korea actually does use a much simpler, more efficient writing system for the bulk of their text, but they do have a few words that they still use Chinese characters for. One of the reforms in North Korea was to abolish the use of Chinese characters entirely, using only the much simpler hangul writing system. His complaint about Korean is more due to how hangul is encoded in Unicode, which could be considered complex or clever depending on how you look at it; in any other sense, though, hangul is a great, very efficient and easy to deal with writing system.",1413647633

A fundamental error tech people make (I say this having learned the hard way from experience) is to not notice the value of what non-techies are saying, and to be honest I get that vibe here.<p>An example of this reinforcing itself is the idea of having a laptop for IRC channel usage, however, if no one else in the audience is on IRC what&#x27;s the point?

You can&#x27;t really expect yourself to grasp chord progressions until you have a firm understanding in scales and you can&#x27;t just gloss over it and be familiar with it, you have to internalize it.  You have to get scales under your fingers... you have to feel the pull of the leading tone to the tonic... you have to be able to sing them and know them inside and out or your knowledge of chord progressions will be built on a shaky foundation.<p>The equivalent to project euler would be to just compose your own songs.

To use English as an example, the word &quot;cats&quot; contains two morphemes, the stem &quot;cat&quot; and the plural suffix &quot;s&quot;. In Korean+Hangul, this sort of combination tends to split neatly into blocks, and when there are multiple options for how the letters can be distributed over them, the orthography usually prefers the variant that keeps the morpheme spelled consistently everywhere. This gives the writing a neat sort of lego blocks feel.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of other nifty traits to Hangul, such as the way many letters derive from each other graphically and thus lend themselves to two-step entry and reduced-number-of-keys inputs like keypads. And the design of the letters is featural, not arbitrary, that is they are often visualizations of tongue position or mouth shape when forming the respective sound.<p>The theme here is: There are many other concerns when it comes to the quality of a writing system.

As already mentioned, Tor users would bear most of the pain and suffering, but if your service supports multipath TCP or something like it, a simplistic &quot;store connecting IP with the session&quot; approach seems like it would cause those users to suffer, too, although not as much.<p>It&#x27;s also possible the client might be in a corporate environment with corporate SSL (MITM) proxies, and maybe there&#x27;s a cluster of them so the public client IPs change for different connections.  So you&#x27;d have to bind sessions to networks, not individual IPs, but what network size do you use?  Then even odd MITM attacks that don&#x27;t use the client&#x27;s real public IP could use another IP on the same subnet as the real client to connect to the remote service, so how much do you actually gain?<p>If session cookies are httponly and secure, what&#x27;s the reason for binding sessions to IPs?<p>If it were just Tor, you could set up a  hidden service, and detect clients that are connecting from Tor exit IPs and redirect them to the hidden service.

8475488,comment,8475215,8475215,0,0,bane,,,"This makes me wonder what effect printing had on English. English used to be chock full of ligatures and special forms for letters (s and ſ for example). I can only imagine as a typesetter and type maker this was all very annoying and people simply started to drop them. However, WP claims [1] ligatures made typesetting easier and it was the introduction of Sans serif fonts in the 20th century that finally drove them away. I&#x27;d be interested in a more definitive history.<p>In either case, by the early 20th century, English (and most Latin based writing systems) were in pretty good shape for computerization, and the limited capacity of computing systems were kind of built around English orthography.<p>Nevertheless, most of these complaints would be true of English as well if we had carried through with our traditional system of writing. One can almost think of Hangul as a 100% ligature based writing system...there&#x27;s fairly complex rules about what letters can be typed next to what other letters and produce a valid character.<p>In Asia, it took longer for general purpose computing to catch on because of both memory and high-resolution display requirements. 7-bit characters being displayed in an 8x8 on-screen block weren&#x27;t going to cut it. It took several generations of advancement before computers that could handle general purpose Japanese properly went on sale. For Japan, a culture that prizes tradition in many ways, the idea of just throwing away 2 of the 3 written systems in order to cram writing into barely functional computing systems, and then adopting that convention culture wide, would be unthinkable. Japan instead went full-tilt on a paper-based system and computerization was focused on scanning and transmission: fax machines, scanners, high speed telecommunications, etc. Even today, the typical Japanese office is a paper-filled minefield full of paper handling devices the typical American office haven&#x27;t seen since the early 1980s. More importantly, there are reasons the Japanese use three (really four if you count romaji) scripts. Something written in katakana gives it an elements of &quot;foreignness&quot;, a bit of semantic hinting about it&#x27;s origin and how it should be considered. Imagine you&#x27;re 11 years old about to play the role of a Western Knight in a video game, the game asks you to input your name, but only offers you katakana, this <i>feels</i> to you more immersive. We have ways of trying to do the same in English, but it&#x27;s far more limited.<p>Before computing took off, handling Asian languages was always a chore. When telegraphs were common, Chinese was encoded using a complex telegraph code [2]. This code was so useful that it&#x27;s still used today in some places. During the cultural revolution, China <i>had</i> a moment where they could have introduced a simpler orthography, Zhuyin Fuhao, that&#x27;s easy to learn to read and write (only slightly more complicated than Korean) and has full tonal representation. But it does a poor job disambiguating the tremendous number of homophones in the highly monosyllabic dialects of Chinese. It also doesn&#x27;t provide a unified representation for words across dialects (the names &quot;Wu&quot; and &quot;Ng&quot; might be the same Chinese characters, but would be written differently in Zhuyin Fuhao). This would reverse thousands of years of cultural unification via written scripts previously enjoyed by China&#x27;s many ethnicities and dialect speakers. (Fun fact, Christianity was first spread to Korea through Korean diplomatic missions to China, where Korean scholars communicated with Chinese converts through writing only as they didn&#x27;t speak each other&#x27;s language). These tradeoffs were simply unacceptable and instead China simply tried to reduce the number of strokes and characters in their writing reform.<p>So does all this suck for computing? Yeah sure. But there&#x27;s lots of weight in the semantics providing the why things are the way they are. China can&#x27;t just adopt a simple to compute writing system any more easily than English Speakers could adopt a complex logography. Or for English Speakers to adopt a sane spelling system (the reasons for why our spelling is so horrible are similar to many of the historic reasons Asian languages have hung on to their overly complex orthographies).<p>If he&#x27;s complaining about these things and pointing to English as an island of relative sanity, he should be glad he doesn&#x27;t have to support older versions of the English language and orthography!<p><i>HWÆT, WE GAR-DEna in geardagum,

8475477,comment,8470337,8474740,0,0,acdha,,,"> Nobody adds a storage device and ends up changing the boot drive on a server. I&#x27;ve never even heard of that in three decades of changing drives on servers.<p>It&#x27;s not especially common, particularly if you don&#x27;t work with large servers or tons of local storage. Here are three variations on this theme which I had to deal with:<p>* The Linux kernel changed the order of device enumeration in a point release (early 2.6, if memory serves). This caused some of our servers to start enumeration the on-board IDE CD-ROM ahead of the SCSI drives and on the next reboot the ones which had been setup before Debian started using UUIDs in /etc/fstab failed because /dev/sda was now the CD drive.<p>* A very similar problem happened involving USB mass storage, which was a problem because our remote administration tools could forward a local drive or ISO image to the remote server as a USB device. This was particularly annoying on one early KVM system which only forwarded the device when you were connected so the logical device ordering changed if you rebooted it while connected to the console.<p>* If you have multiple controllers in a system, the drives are enumerated in order per-controller. If the bays were not fully populated when the system was first setup, a new drive added to controller 1 will be enumerated ahead of the drives from controller 2 and all of the subsequent device names will be shifted by one.<p>All of these are why it&#x27;s now routine to use UUIDs to identify drives. It&#x27;s a solvable problem but hasn&#x27;t been so for even a single decade.<p>> And in the rare case where automatic restart is a good idea, I wrap that script in a supervisor, like monit, as god intended.<p>Uptime and resilience are baseline requirements for what I work on, not &quot;rare cases&quot;. I&#x27;ve used external supervisors but that&#x27;s introducing a third-party tool with its own bugs and means that you can&#x27;t assume that another sysadmin is familiar with it. If you&#x27;re the monit person in a supervisord shop (or vice versa) you&#x27;ll probably have something take longer to debug or break at some point because of a subtlety in the differences between the two.<p>This is such a common case that it makes sense to solve it once at the system level, particularly since that allows me to e.g. not have to code an extra bit in my daemon that knows how to ask arbitrary third-party supervisors about a different process.<p>> If a process is crashing for more than the supervisor&#x27;s respawn limit, then you have a problem that computers can&#x27;t solve. Not sure how you thought that could be resolved automatically.<p>That&#x27;s a fine approach if the failures are caused by something like a broken config file but it doesn&#x27;t handle environmental failures gracefully. For example, consider a daemon which fails if it can&#x27;t resolve a hostname or connect to a server (e.g. a database) or which exits if it can&#x27;t write to disk. In either case, you&#x27;re going to have downtime if the server / data-center drops offline or a partition fills up.<p>The question is whether the service comes back quickly after the underlying problem is fixed or requires someone to localize it and restart the process. If you have one server and you happen to be on-duty, this isn&#x27;t a big deal but for anyone with many servers running different apps it can be a headache after a network partition or power failure (oops, web servers all came online well before the database server finished checking its RAID array).<p>In the case of upstart, the default respawn limit is only 10 times within 5 seconds after which it will stop the job until you manually restart it. Since they didn&#x27;t add throttling or delays, there&#x27;s no way to deal with this within upstart without either increasing downtime for every error (e.g. adding &quot;|| sleep 10&quot; to every script) or wasting more CPU restarting jobs as quickly as possible until you hit a larger limit.<p>Again, not an unsolvable problem but had they not ignored a huge amount of prior art and perhaps even consulted with actual sysadmins there would be things like a respawn delay and backoff so you could say things like &quot;restart this no more than n times per minute&quot;. Instead, most places either convert everything to use a different supervisor or support an external monitor which requests restarts for services periodically, both of which add maintenance overhead and risk for what is a standard feature on other systems.",1413645320

I know that this is less and less of a deal with high resolution displays, but it&#x27;s still worth considering just how easy to parse an icon is at small size.",1413644763

Programmers who don&#x27;t get angry while solving hard, inconvenient, uncomfortable problems are, in my experience, unlikely to truly solve those problems --- sweeping issues under the rug, or passing the problem to someone else is more likely.<p>That&#x27;s a really interesting point and it makes me think of a developer that I&#x27;ve worked with (in a company of non-developers) who cared more about &#x27;inconveniences&#x27; than I did.<p>It occurs to me that he did a much better job of engaging with these &#x27;inconveniences&#x27; and fixing them.<p>Perhaps I should get a bit angrier?",1413644758

Simply because I happen to be just one of the many pentalingual (if that&#x27;s a term) people I know. My entire family speaks five languages. English, Hindi, Marathi, Kutcchi and Gujarati. Kutcchi and Gujarati are what I was born into. The rest are mandatory through school here (Mumbai, India). So anyone who went to school is at least trilingual. In fact most students are fluent in at least 3 languages by the time they are 6 or so.<p>If there is any good at all in being bilingual, what does it mean to be trilingual? Let alone pentalingual?

In fact I read a fascinating argument (from a link on HN?.. I forget) about Japanese computers developing into &quot;appliances&quot; (a gaming machine and a separate more expensive word processing machine for professionals) because early computers were too under-powered to support the Japanese character set. And that it was because lacking these problems that Americans developed &quot;general&quot; computing first, with the Japanese stuck in the &quot;appliance&quot; mindset until the late nineties.<p>Secondly, I&#x27;m not a native English speaker and I always had this sentiment; &quot;why isn&#x27;t all computing in English&quot;, &quot;why do we have i18n&quot;, etc. For one, I don&#x27;t think everyone studying a standard foreign language is bad, and while English is probably not the best option (Spanish is reportedly easier), it&#x27;s there, it&#x27;s as close or closer to being lingua franca as any other, and it&#x27;s certainly easier than the language with the largest number of native speakers (Chinese). And then even someone with bad English might benefit from at least having File and Edit menus instead of often crazy translations of these things. A little bit of English and a little bit of standardization can&#x27;t hurt.<p>Of course ultimately computers ought to display text in all those languages - if not in menus, etc. then certainly in the content itself - so this sentiment of mine isn&#x27;t very helpful at all.

As for your concerns about including a library, I urge you to reconsider if you can afford the extra download size. The Observer pattern is ubiquitous in software and you&#x27;ll be amazed how versatile Rx is. At Netflix we use it on the server and client for a wide variety of different tasks.

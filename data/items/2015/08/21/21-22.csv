My observation was that debt is acceptable --and even good-- if, and only if, the person or organization has a historical track record and culture of efficient use of capital and will, in fact, continue to use capital efficiently after incurring further debt.<p>The examples I provided are but a few from a huge list showing we are not efficient.  In that context, yes, the examples are absolutely relevant.  I have personally been involved in several government contract bids where I saw how government actors, systems and procedures managed to pay twice as much than market rate for items being procured.  The waste present in government spending is likely to be of staggering proportions.<p>It&#x27;s like borrowing money to buy a truck for your business and paying twice market rate for the truck.  The reality is that this hypothetical business probably wouldn&#x27;t have needed extra cash had it been responsible about capital utilization throughout it&#x27;s history.",1440194377

Take a request, farm out pieces of it to multiple other servers, aggregate responses. Some of those requests finish in 5ms, some take several seconds, which is a crappy pattern to deal with. Today&#x27;s not a particularly busy day, so we&#x27;re doing about 70 req/sec/VM at 5% CPU on a dual core VM. In load tests I&#x27;ve had it up to 300 req/sec/VM with no problems.

A few notes:<p>I&#x27;m not sure reducing keystrokes is a useful measure.  I can&#x27;t think of a better one, though, so at least it&#x27;s something quantifiable.<p>Pure tree editing, with no text editor to fall back to, is important.  I didn&#x27;t even use textual output, while it sounds like these guys did.  They also used javascript, which is interesting since it has so much syntax.  Lisp seems like a natural choice to me since the tree structure is readily apparent.<p>Dogfooding is critical, and it&#x27;s very natural for a project like this.  When I got to that point, I learned so much about what was really important in an editor.  Like macros -- those helped so much.<p>Keyboard-based editing of trees is possible, but it takes significant effort to make it feel decently natural.<p>Collaboration is definitely the most important thing people in this area need to learn.  There are dozens of projects similar to this one, and they&#x27;re generally created by solo programmers (like I did) or by pairs (like Prune).  Tree-based editing will never take off until a group of like-minded programmers gets together and makes it happen.  I&#x27;ve been pulled away into an unrelated project, but if I were to come back to this, my first move would be to get some collaborators.",1440193950

Even at small companies, I have seen places where a small subset of an organization get cancerous or hardened by a bad director, and then when a new CEO comes in (often because an investment firm takes over) that director is given the boot quite quickly.  Often this director is allowed to remain because the previous CEO is somehow related or friends with that person, and once that pressure or corruption is gone, then that director is no longer protected.<p>In the case of the UN, if I were to surmise, it is impossible to do so because so many of the corruptions are external.  It is possible that nobody is capable of actually cleaning things up because one country or a group of countries want to keep making sure that one of their friends live high on the hog at taxpayer expense without doing anything valuable, hence the terrible personal actions listed in the article.  Dealing with these external corruptions are basically impossible in a modern political climate in many nations, and of course globally.<p>I don&#x27;t have the connections, influence, intellectual capability, or any kind of power to disrupt such massive forces.

More U.S. teenagers now have a smartphone than a license.<p>I&#x27;d guess that the rise in cell phones, text messaging, and now smartphones was a big contributor to the decline in early licenses and also in the urgency of teens to get their own car.<p>Before such easy communications, you generally were not in contact with your friends except when you were actually physically with them at school or at pre-arranged times outside of school. You could call then on the phone, of course, but that only worked if they were home to take the call, and you had to compete with the rest of your family for the phone in your house.<p>This made spontaneous arranging of rides from friends a rather uncertain endeavor. Unless your parents were very generous in the policies for sharing the family car(s) with you, getting a car of your own meant a tremendous leap in your freedom.<p>Nowadays, a large fraction of teens have cell phones, largely smartphones. They make heavy use of them for messaging services and social networks (and, I&#x27;ve been told, they sometimes even actually use them to talk!). They update their statuses several times a day, and send on average something like 100 messages a day.<p>Because of this, today&#x27;s teens (and younger) are much better informed as to where their friends are and what they are doing when those friends are not physically present. They know which of their friends with cars are not busy, and it is trivial to propose a joint trip to the place they wish to go.<p>Accordingly, having your own car is not as important as it once was. Your social group is now more efficient at sharing cars than social groups were back before widespread mobile communications.",1440192681

Given experience with the XUL/XPCOM/JS stack, you can still pretty much do anything you want without too much difficulty. However, three things have happened since then:<p>1) No one outside of Mozilla adopted XUL/XPCOM/JS as an application platform. There are probably many reasons for this, but the main one, based on my recollection of early Mozilla, was that XUL was too slow and didn&#x27;t look native, and JS was likewise too slow and not considered to be a real programming language. That has changed significantly since Mozilla&#x27;s introduction, as both the layout and JS engines have improved substantially, but that was the picture at its introduction. In time, JS was revitalized, but so was HTML. HTML has now achieved some success as an application platform (e.g. Atom and Spotify), but XUL remains basically unused outside of Mozilla.<p>2) Because no one adopted XUL/XPCOM/JS, Mozilla stopped looking at it as an application platform and started looking at it as a legacy technology that they at one time used to build a browser. As a result, it began to stagnate, and interest in documenting things so that other people outside of Mozilla could use them waned. And because XUL/XPCOM/JS are now niche technologies, no one knows them and there&#x27;s no value in learning them outside of being able to write Firefox extensions, so Firefox does not seem so easily extensible to outsiders.<p>3) Chrome happened, and Mozilla saw what Chrome gained by not building a fully extensible platform and wants that for itself. On the flip side, I&#x27;m not sure that Mozilla fully recognizes what it currently gains from having an extensible platform.",1440192167

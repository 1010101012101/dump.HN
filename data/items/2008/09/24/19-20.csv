Communicating ideas to somebody else probably uses different parts of the brain than solitary thinking does. It's best when the listener has good ideas, but sometimes just the act of communicating the problem can get you unstuck.<p>Anthropomorphising parts of a problem (""this object is trying to send this message to this other one, but it isn't getting through"") can be useful, for the same reason.",1222286381
313992,comment,313866,313866,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"in line with what axod mentions:\nas a young field, software engineering is still pretty meritocratic.  That is, the only standard a software engineer is held up to is if his code gets the job done. All fields start off this way, but over time formal institutions grow up around them.  Eventually, just as there is an American Psychological Association, I expect there to be an American Software Association.  When this happens it tends to create new ways in which you can be successful in the field.  Just as not all (or even most) of the members of the American Psychological Association are good practicing psychologists.",1222286363

I'm endlessly annoyed by coworkers who come up with questions when they haven't yet worked through the problem in their mind.

I don't know of startup attorneys in the Bay Area, but plenty of people here should. (If you don't get any responses, I'd directly email 5-6 YC startups in the area and ask who they use.)

Prepare a term sheet, subscription agreement, and other paperwork for the investor to sign.<p>3. Verify that the investor is an accredited investor (which I think means $1M net worth, or $200K salary for the last two years).

A big problem is that we really <i>don't know how to build good software</i>. This does not mean good software does not exist. It means that we don't have reliable methodology to produce good software. In contrast, we have reliable methodologies to build good bridges.<p>The ACM studied this with the IEEE in 2000, and came to this conclusion (<a href=""http://www.cs.wm.edu/~coppit/csci690-spring2004/papers/selep_main.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.wm.edu/~coppit/csci690-spring2004/papers/selep...</a>): ""Following a study by a blue ribbon panel of prominent software engineers,\nthe ACM Council decided in May 1999 that it could not support licensing of software engineers. ACM's position is that our state of knowledge and practice in software engineering is too immature to warrant licensing.""<p>I think it's important to differentiate between Computer Science and Software Engineering. That is, the difference between someone whose goal is contributing to the base of knowledge in their field, and someone whose goal is a stable, working system. There is, of course, overlap, but I think the distinction is still there.<p>I think that in the future, there will be separate CS and SE degrees. Much of what they learn will be the same, but the focus will be different. A CS education will prepare you to be a researcher; a SE education will prepare you to build software. (I know SE degrees exist, but most schools only have a CS program.) I don't think this split will happen until SE is mature enough to be licensed.<p>What does this have to do with your question?<p>We don't have reliable methodologies to build good software, and the only formal education people receive that involves building software isn't necessarily focused on actually building software. This is a nice way of saying ""we don't know what we're doing."" If even the best people in the field  don't know what we're doing, then you can learn that on your own.<p>Personally, I still think a CS degree is the best preparation right now to be a professional SE. You will probably be exposed to more things than you would find on your own. But I also recognize that there are probably many professional developers without degrees who are better at what they do than people with degrees.<p>Also note that if you actually want to do research, then you <i>need</i> to get a degree.",1222284181

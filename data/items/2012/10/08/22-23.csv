4629097,comment,4627775,4628416,1,0,Timothee,,,"I think I know what you're saying: times and times again, unknown people with no diplomas have found success in the tech industry. However that just means that it's possible to succeed without credentials or education.<p>But that doesn't mean the industry doesn't care about them. Look at how many stories mention ""founded by ex-Googlers/Facebook"", ""YC-backed"", etc. Sure, these are just from tech blogs, but if they add it in there it's because the readership reacts to that information, most often positively.<p>Besides, I don't think any industry doesn't care about credentials, since at least someone's reputation is their credential. For example, I don't know much about John Resig besides the fact that he created jQuery. That fact would open him many doors. It's not about education, but it's still credentials. Don't you think YC would instantly back him?<p>More to the point, I'm totally convinced that adding ""YC-backed startup"" to your resume, even if said startup never really went anywhere, is a very strong credential in a lot of places and I wouldn't be surprised if people use it that way. I'd even say that I'm sure many YC applications are ""YC or nothing"" in that if they don't get in, they won't start a company. It doesn't hurt to apply but the upside is fantastic: you get access to a great network, media coverage, some automatic seed money and that YC stamp you can put on your resume.",1349737157

It's true that multi-stage thermonuclear devices often have a final fission stage where huge amounts of energy are released, however if one were to purposefully maximize energy release while minimizing fallout there are some relatively clean fusion/fission ratios achievable.<p>For instance, the test version of the Tsar bomb had its last fission stage removed, reportedly resulting in a 97% fusion detonation.

My friends that went to private Schools are mostly taking gap years and most of my friends that went to state schools are going to University or going to work, etc. Interestingly those that went through the state sector tend to know where they want to be going more, I don't want to play to stereotypes but this could be because their were fewer constraints put on them in terms of possible job paths.<p>It's most likely because in the UK we don't have high school, once you're 16 you finish school and can go to Sixth Form College where you choose 4 subjects to focus on, none are compulsory and get deeper knowledge in what you're interested in. Many people feel that after going through School and Sixth Form they want to take some time to explore before University.<p>I've personally not gone to University this year and am working on a startup, I can't call it a gap year as although I have traveled a fair amount to speak at conferences, etc I'm still spending all of my time building a company. I definitely believe whatever path people choose, it should be one that has a rationale behind it over following the crowd or what they were taught to believe.

Internally, the framework uses topological sorting of a graph of nodes, where each node is a method with potentially blocking code and the dependencies between the nodes are the edges of the graph. The framework is able to set up callbacks automatically in the right order given the above.<p>- iOS6 auto-layouts internally use constraint solving on a set of linear equations so that you can write code to set the layout of your UI elements in terms of equations (so that you can basically just say that your button should be at 40px left of center of its superview, and with a 100px padding from the bottom).<p>- I wrote code to improve the accuracy of models at my previous job by employing various machine learning algorithms (thanks Andrew Ng and Coursera).<p>These might be isolated examples, but my point is that some of the best code I have seen uses a lot of math and CS concepts (sometimes in clever ways).",1349736443

We could validate your style of calculation by assuming single-engine failures are IID with parameter ""p,"" uniform on the unit interval.  (A beta distribution would be the standard conjugate prior.)<p>If we go ahead and make the uniform-p assumption, then what you've calculated is a most-likely posterior value of ""p"" (35/36).  (This is the maximum-likelihood estimate for p.)  But in a Bayesian world, ""p"" has a full posterior distribution, not just a most-likely value.<p>So, still in the Bayesian world, the probability of failure (P(N_fail > 2)) must be calculated on the basis of <i>not</i> the most likely p, but the posterior of ""p"".  You didn't do this; you just used the most-likely p.<p>Which brings us to the second problem with your reply.  You really can get a confidence value on P(N_fail > 2).  You can get a full posterior distribution!  It will be a 1-dimensional density on [0,1].  And you could calculate this, either by simulation or by an analytic procedure (because it's a low-dimensional problem).<p>This posterior on P(N_fail > 2) would be the answer to the parent's question.

Hint: a lot of it is directly related to copyright monopolies.  Think of the hundreds or thousands of recording artists who would abandon the labels if they could get back the ability to publish their own songs, rather than having to ask the label for permission due to copyright assignments and work-for-hire claims.<p>> Indeed here copyright is what would protect the artist from a label to just copy the music and selling it for profit.<p>Nonsense.  Copyright creates a market for the transfer of copyright, which immediately plays into the hands of large-scale distributors by ensuring nobody can compete with them.  The economies of their scale are not natural economies; they're economies created by an artificially high barrier to entry for competitors, and the artificial scarcity imposed on markets by copyright law is the primary advantage enjoyed by such large-scale distributors.<p>> Also, interestingly, Open Source would not work without copyright. That's right. The GPL, (to some extend) the Apache License, and many other licenses only work because of copyright, which grants the owner the right to license software to you under a license.<p>Well, jkn already answered this point, but I'll add an additional comment on this subject:<p>We'd be better off without copyleft licensing.  Software does not have to be GPLed to be open source, and in fact the GPL and other copyleft licenses actually stand in the way of many open source projects making use of code distributed under those copyleft licenses.",1349734736

I don't know who most of these these 3rd party developers are most of the time, and that unknown makes me distrust by default. Not to say I wouldn't use a FB app that provided a service to me that I desired - I have, and I do. My original point was that I don't think I could ever trust an app enough to be able to send private messages from my name without my consent to do so - every time it wants to. The few apps I do use have greatly restricted permissions from what the app developers originally asked me for.<p>However, don't let that comment drive the assumption that I inherently trust /Facebook/, either. I don't.  I use FB with the clear understanding that they only know about me what I choose to tell them about me. I don't put anything on Facebook that I wouldn't print out and tape to a telephone pole as public information.<p>I don't use FB chat. Not because I inherently distrust it - I don't inherently ""trust"" it either, but that's not primarily why I don't use it. I just don't have a use case for it. Likewise for messaging - I don't have a use case for it in most cases. Why would I give my private messages to Facebook when I can just send an email to the person directly?<p>I tend not to use mobile FB apps either. Again not necessarily as a matter of trust but as a matter of use case. I usually just access it via browser, so I don't have any real reason to use a specific mobile app - I've tried them, and none of them really seem to be any better of an experience (to me) than just hitting the browser version.<p>So I've yet to find a compelling reason to trade my trust for a product or service through the platform, and frankly, it'd have to be a pretty awesome thing for me to make that trade-off.",1349734702

No, I don't maintain a database of every such discussion in which I've participated, tagged with metadata about the fallacies employed in various discussions.<p>> not even the most corrupt media industry lobbyist or the most position-distorting, bought-and-paid-for politician, argue complete absolutes like that.<p>That's because they generally prefer to avoid speaking in absolutes except in specific, rare cases.  The implications are obvious, even when their phrasing allows for what they think constitutes plausible deniability.<p>> More importantly, I have certainly never seen anyone genuinely interested in changing copyright law for the better promoting such a position.<p>It's not the people who want to change copyright law for the better that I'm most worried about.  It's the people who want to maintain the status quo, plus add more restrictions, that are the biggest problem.  Maybe you haven't said such things, and maybe you're interested in improving things in your own misguided way, but (for instance) Chris Dodd is only interested in improving the position of the MPAA -- and I'm pretty sure he has a hell of a lot more sway with Congress than you.<p>> There are alternatives to the mess that is today's implementation of copyright that don't involve killing the entire principle.<p>Yep -- and they're great stepping stones on the way to eliminating prior restraint of the free act of creation.",1349734386

4628944,comment,4625474,4626030,1,0,apotheon,,,"> clearly we produce vastly more new works under copyright than we ever did when we relied on patronage.<p>When patronage was en vogue, we didn't have as high a rate of literacy or access to digital editing tools.  These facilitations of the process of creation, even ignoring things like cheap paper and disposable writing implements that last months and cost less than a bottle of water, dwarf any legal changes that might otherwise apply (notwithstanding France's dark period of outlawing the printing press altogether as a tool of sedition).  If copyright has anything to do with the current rate of creation, it is primarily by impeding the spread of inspirational materials that might otherwise hasten creative people's efforts.  Compare copyright-controlled England with mostly copyright-free Germany in the 1800s to see how the freedom to copy and resell lit a fire under the asses of both writers and publishers, and created a lot more writers by spreading knowledge far and wide and as rapidly as possible to create a (for the era) highly educated population.<p>> it would take lots of very rich people giving up a lot of their wealth to get anywhere near funding just what today's movie industry costs<p>I think it's pretty clear that there is little correlation between relative level of funding and relative quality in the movie industry.

That was my definition of ""not even remotely.""  I did not mean to imply that it was a fundamentally different algorithm, only that it was a far more sophisticated and optimized implementation of the same algorithm.  My apologies if this was unclear or appeared overstated.<p>> That's a tautology at best, and meaningless at worst.<p>By ""these abstraction possibilities"" I meant the ones you mentioned, which is true.<p>> And similarly, any Python application that requires (insert some uncommon requirement ..) can do what C can with the same kind of help that strcmp() gets - by delegating to the layer that does it best.<p>That's great and I fully support that.

Relatively recent changes in the handling of speculation in commodities is causing across-the-board price increases where prices should be decreasing instead.

2700512,comment,2697301,2700228,2,0,sigil,,,"> I have yet to hear any of them put actual numbers to their assertions. If you have any, I would honestly love to hear them.<p>As would I. Unfortunately, actual numbers seem hard to come by. Performance of CRA loans simply wasn't tracked. From a Fed study some years prior to the crisis:<p><i>We received responses from 143 of the 500 institutions to which we sent the survey (a 28.6 percent response rate). These responses and our follow-up telephone contacts revealed that banking institutions generally do not track profitability and performance separately for CRA-related lending...</i> [1] [2]<p>For this reason, arguments absolving the CRA [3] instead look at high interest rate loans to low income households. If this is a good proxy for CRA lending, then CRA lending was a drop in the bucket.<p>However, there is evidence to the contrary. Edward Pinto, chief credit officer at Fannie Mae during the 1980s, published a report in 2008 that has some numbers you might be interested in. [4] From another article summarizing them [5]:<p><i>While its difficult to find data on how these CRA loans have performed, the few bank reports that break out these loans show much higher default rates than prime loans. Pintos research indicates that Fannie and Freddies affordable housing loans are a good proxy for CRA loans performance. For example, Fannies delinquency rate on its $900 billion in high-risk loans, 85 percent of which are affordable housing loans, was 11.36 percent at September 30, 2009about 6.5 times the 1.8 percent delinquency rate on the GSEs traditionally underwritten loans. While the vast majority of CRA loans were fixed rate and did not have higher interest rates like other subprime loans, Pintos research has found that most had high risk characteristics such as small downpayments and impaired credit, signaled by a low borrower FICO score. As a result, loans with these high-risk characteristics have performed similarly to fixed rate subprime loans.</i><p><i>Perhaps more important in its implications for the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie did not report that their mortgages were subprime and Alt-A. So instead of the 12 million prime loans market participants expected, Fannie and Freddie had added 12 million subprime and Alt-A loans to the market...</i><p><i>So, by the middle of 2008, there were almost 27 million subprime and Alt-A loans in the U.S. financial system. This amounted to almost 50 percent of all mortgages. More than two-thirds of these mortgages were held or guaranteed by government agencies like FHA (about 4.8 million), and the GSEs Fannie and Freddie (12 million loans), and by U.S. banks (a residual of about 2.2 million).</i><p>But I personally think the real answer is, we just don't know, CRA lending wasn't tracked. Hopefully next time we decide to experiment on this scale, we collect some data. ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2000/1100.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2000/1100.ht...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/communitydev/craloansurvey.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/communitydev/craloansurvey.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://dallasfed.org/ca/bcp/2009/bcp0901.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dallasfed.org/ca/bcp/2009/bcp0901.cfm</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.aei.org/docLib/Pinto-Sizing-Total-Federal-Contributions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aei.org/docLib/Pinto-Sizing-Total-Federal-Contrib...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj30n2/cj30n2-12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj30n2/cj30n2-12.pdf</a>",1309160828

2700478,story,,,5,6,Houston,"Ask HN: 19-Years-Old & Managing A Team of 10 - 20 People, Need Advice",,"Earlier this year, I was hired by a start-up Internet marketing company to be their copywriter. However, my responsibilities have always been much more diverse than simply writing copy. I've essentially been the company's jack-of-all-trades, and it is something I greatly enjoy, as each day is truly a new day and nothing gets repetitive.<p>About a month ago, I was given the responsibility of heading a massive project that will essentially serve as the foundation upon which the company will rely on to grow larger and more profitable. Due to how large the project is, it requires quite a few employees if I am to meet the goal set by my boss, the CEO. As of today, I've hired 3 people, and am managing an additional 7 of our in-house employees. Lately, everything has been fine and well, but it is very apparent that for me to meet our goal, I will need to ramp up the number of employees working on the project.<p>And, with that... I run into a problem. My boss and his partner have personalities that are as polar opposite as can be. My boss is very hands off, but takes no bullshit, despises laziness, and when he wants something done, he demands you do it by any means necessary. However, his partner is a micro-manager, even in things he has no experience in, i.e this current project. He fastidiously manages a profits and loss sheet for every project we're running -- which I realize makes business sense -- but, it lends itself to him demanding maximum output from minimal resources, no questions asked.<p>With this particular project, profits will not start rolling in en masse for a couple of months after the infrastructure is in place. My boss knows this, as he understands what goes into it and has experience in launching similar projects of his own in the past. If I am to pander to only him, I would simply go out and get the employees I need to reach our goal. But, I can't pander only to him, especially since his partner sat me down and asked me to try to play the middle ground between him and my boss. However, the partner doesn't realize how long it will take for money to start rolling in, so if I continue to hire employees and he doesn't see money rolling in, he will automatically assume we are getting minimal output with maximum resources and want to either scale back the number of employees or can the project completely.<p>In my honest opinion, I need more employees. If we are to ultimately meet our goal, it is necessary. The current number of employees simply can't meet up with the work load, even if they were machines and pulled 80-hour weeks. But, again, if I go out and hire 7 more people (how many I intend on hiring), the partner will be very wary and most likely take it as me rejecting his input in everything, which I'm not doing.<p>Would you guys suggest I sit down with the partner to explain how I see things inside and out with regards to this project and it's needs? He listens, and is open to most things, so I think that if I came up with a report for him to read that justified the hiring needs, he'd be okay and at ease, and I could present the report to him the day before we met to discuss everything so I could simply address his concerns rather than explain everything to him AND THEN address his concerns in one swoop.<p>My main concern is not crossing either my boss or his partner. I don't want to step on feet, or indirectly infringe on their positions of authority, which I could easily do if I didn't hire the necessary employees because the boss believes I should do what I need to meet our goal or if I went out and hired the employees I need because the partner is wary. Any advice would be appreciated.<p>Also, I did think of a way to get more out of our current employees. Or, at least, one position within the many positions. Vaguely, the goal is to put up 1,000 websites by the end of summer (or the start of August) that are ""profitable."" To do this, we need designers, coders, me for content and then people to rank these websites.<p>Right now, the designers is where we're hitting a rut. To create 1,000 websites by the beginning of August (minus the ~50 or so we've created already), our designers as a collective need to design ~27/day, or ~135/5-day work week. Between 3 people, that's just not possible judging by their current performance. Each designer, on average, generates 15 designs/week. So, to generate ~135 designs/week, we need ~9 employees generating ~15 designs/week. Due to the nature of the websites, the designers can essentially design 1 template and replicate it 5x over by making minor alterations to their designs (mainly in the name of the sites and the phone numbers included on the sites). But, no one is really doing this because all of them have told me that they'd rather switch up their designs for this reason or that. I am an understanding person, and coming from a background informed by creativity (being a writer, and all), I get that they don't want to make the same design over and over and over because they're not able to be the artists that they are, which strips the fun out of what they do entirely. I don't like this, because I my personal philosophy is that you should enjoy your job, not wake up and despise it, which I'm afraid would happen if I demanded each designer make 1-template and do the replications, and then rinse and repeat for each new set of sites, but it would increase their productivity by a lot.<p>Should I stop being their ""friend,"" and be their boss, and just tell them that they must do the replications? Mind you, this would mean I'm ignoring my personal philosophies. But, does that even matter in situations such as this? In a business context, whose success and failure depends on profitability more so than remaining 100% philosophically pure personally?<p>As you can tell, I've been thinking about this stuff a lot. I'm looking for people who have been in similar situations or have a lot of experience in managing bodies of people, so if possible, just throw a line or two about how your experience will give your advice credence.<p>Thanks, HN! You guys have been great so far for this type of stuff.",1309159716

Because the documentation for the one time auth doesn't indicate anything like that.<p>So I am confused as to what is happening in the background on Google's side.<p>My pseudo-model is that their password acceptance library looks for a correctly identified two factor authentication OR a one time password out of the user's one time password table.<p>But then I don't understand why these one time auths are one time! If someone finds my phone, or accesses one of my other net accounts that was authorized by my one time auth, they completely win until I can get back to google's page to revoke them.<p>And related, I don't understand why the authenticator can't generate these one time passwords -- MANY TIMES THAT WOULD BE A LOT MORE CONVENIENT than having to go to the specific page on the web.<p>And also related: why is there no pin or password for the authenticator?<p>These are just questions I have -- I'd love to read a page or two that discusses these issues -- I think having a good model of how and why it works as it does would help me secure my data.",1309159662

The problem with learning things on your own is that the examples from which you are self-learning are (by design) too simple and often unrelated to a result that you want.<p>That's not to say the tutorial/source would be completely unrelated, but it sounds like from your post, that coding isn't something that comes easily which means that in order to make the leap to something that you actually want to do, you'll need more than a book to guide your way.<p>The great thing about a mentor is that they (should) will have a real life problem for you to solve and they can help you work through some of the subtleties of the problem.<p>I used to think that anyone can learn to code (this was when I was 18). I find, now, that there are people that are more naturally inclined to it and some people that will never be able to, because their brains don't work that way. I would gently encourage you to be open to discovering where you lie on that spectrum and not to be too disappointed if you've tried but still find yourself swimming in molasses.",1309158050

5449316,comment,5448983,5448983,8,0,dljsjr,,,"I'm a huge vim fan myself, but I haven't thrown IDE's out of the window entirely.<p>There are still 2 things that I can't give up that IDE's do better than vim (in my opinion):<p>1. Refactoring operations.  I have yet to find a vim plugin that has the extreme refactoring awareness I've become accustomed to in IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse.  And writing a macro to do it for you is not the answer, because these tasks are non trivial to do a.) correctly, b.) in the general case, and c.) across an entire codebase.  There's a reason people have sunk a gazillion years and R&D dollars in to creating IDE's, and some bullshit vim macro that I put together mid-day on a Thursday because I need to extract a method isn't going to compete.<p>2. Super-powerful auto completions.  I get that vim has code completion plugins, and most of them are <i>good</i> (I'm currently using YouCompleteMe).  But they aren't <i>great</i>.  IntelliJ has it's legendary ""index the world"" mentality, and is really great at fuzzy match finding.  Eclipse is a little clunkier, but its ability to drop in the entire method signature and provide tab-stops for quickly filling in the parameters is a boon.<p>The majority of my bias towards these features probably comes from the fact that I write Java code for a living at my day job, where the ""documentation"" is actually the code completion popup 90% of the time and most file operations or refactors are accompanied by some degree of boilerplate that is handily automated.  Say what you will about verbose code and ""enterprise"" languages, but learning an API as you go by mindlessly mashing Ctrl+Space and skipping the inheritance/implementation rain dance is a huge productivity gain.<p>I do all of my C/C++, Haskell, HTML/CSS/JS, and Ruby in vim, where I have a pain-stakingly customized pathogen setup that I sync across all of my computers (personal and work).  Code completion is good enough, between YouCompleteMe and ctags, but I still miss refactoring something fierce.  But if FP Complete releases their Haskell IDE tomorrow and it isn't completely offensive to look at (Leksah!), has good refactoring, and has good code completion, I'd jump ship in a heartbeat.<p>I don't think that the whole IDE vs. vim/emacs war is real.  I think that they're two completely different tools that are good at very different things; I will not argue that I am <i>way, way, way</i> faster at just editing text in vim; EasyMotion, ctags, never having to use a mouse... I love these things.  But anybody that writes off an IDE without fully understanding just how powerful the two features I mentioned above can be when dealing with multi-million loc codebases is being narrow minded.",1364391891

Problem was, the largest competitors could <i>also</i> make a profit at 25% of their then-current prices, and had large established user-bases. We were inexperienced enough in business to not worry too much about <i>why</i> their prices were to high - we assumed without thinking that their prices reflected their cost base. Instead it reflected their belief about the market at a time - they'd rather sell at that price with a ridiculous margin, than cut the price and grow the total size of the market.<p>We went in cocky about a big competitive advantage, and it took about 3 days after launch before the incumbent dropped prices to match ours, and while we kept growing, it obviously made things a lot harder.<p>This company might find the same in the mobile data market if they get any traction at all: Many of their competitors can drop the roaming charges massive pretty much over-night, have large warchests, and have roaming agreements in place that can quickly be re-negotiated if they and their partners start seeing this startup as a threat to their revenues. The massive benefit they can provide now, and the seeming headstart they have on their competitors can evaporate pretty much overnight.",1364391698

Heck, Yahoo has talented hires, they could create a similar app from scratch for significantly less.<p>Ok, I think get your point.  Still I have to disagree.  The thing is this, many successful ideas don't need lots of genuine innovation and creativity.  Instead they need to be 1. realized, 2. at the right time and 3. targetted towards the right people.<p>IMHO Facebook is a prime example for this.  When you look at the history of communities, Facebook was by no means innovative.  There have been plenty communities already and the world of communities progressed towards continuous improvements.  In fact I used to be a vivid user of many Web 1.0 communities and watched with great excitement the transition from tech-people dominated communities towards general audience communities.  Why did Yahoo not create Facebook?  Well, it's the same reason small startups can drive big elephants out of business.  I think there have been enough posts about this thing on HN in the past.<p>>But they instead chose to buy it, at the stupidly high figure that they chose. That is why people just don't understand.
1. The authors did put a lot of time in it (yes, multiple people worked on that, check out the website's About)
2. A great number of users are using it
3. Yahoo is not the only company interested in taking over a working website. Market mechanics.",1364390056

All you have to do is link your grocery store rewards card and scan it every time you use the bus, which will authorize the company to access all your purchase data from that card.<p>You could very easily argue that this is a good thing, and perhaps at the outset it would be. But if it turns out that the company is doing something sleazy--rewards cards sometimes also encode personally-identifying information which could be used unethically, for example--then at that point a person's livelihood could very well depend on continuing to use that bus system, especially if the convenience of the system forced other free or low-cost alternatives to stop serving those neighborhoods.<p>In both of these cases (the IRS preparing your taxes and the company holding your personal information), the organization is not incentivized to do a good job.

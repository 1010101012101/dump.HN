I see a very valid reason why Apple would instate such a policy. Even though in the past Apple supplied the run-time for Java it still did not make it OSX it was just a very well tailored JRE for OSX, you still write Java apps and not OSX apps if you target the JRE.",1287752339

1819478,comment,1819293,1819447,0,0,AlexMuir,,,"I'm not started yet - I just used the present tense for brevity above.  I'm going to test the market over the next couple of weeks with a sample dropoff.  I founded a student storage business [<a href=""http://www.thebigspace.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thebigspace.co.uk</a>] 7 years ago and so I've got a good grasp of the logistics of collecting and moving boxes.  I also have lots of empty boxes.<p>1. Zero so far.<p>2. I'm going to start at 15% after selling costs (ebay fees and shipping)<p>3. I'll start by dropping boxes to 100 houses and see what I get back - if it works at that scale then I think it should scale up.<p>4. UK.<p>5. I hope so.  I suspect it will because I can bulk up similar things and then ship them to the markets where they'll sell well.  Eg.  Old phones still fetch good money in Africa.  XBox and Playstation games sell well in Eastern Europe.  Likewise, DVDs are still in demand.<p>I think the advantage over the dropshop model is:<p>1. Much more appealing for householders: I've got loads of stuff that just depreciating year by year.  By the time I've found a box, boxed it up, found a dropshop, driven it there, and filled in the forms I could have sold it myself.  This way you just pick the box up at your front door, walk round the house and fill it, write your email address on the box, and leave it back at the door.<p>2. Scalability: I can do this nationally by shipping inbound boxes for $7.50.  I can also use a rep system, whereby local people (think Avon ladies) take on their area on a part time basis.<p>3. Low overhead: No premises.  Centralised facility for sorting through things - ideally with the facility to simply enter a model number and condition for common items to generate a standard listing, without the need to write anything or photograph things.<p>Drop me an email if you want - me@alexmuir.com",1287752192

Nothing new ever occurs in the business of speculating in stock and commodities.<p>2. Money cannot be consistently made trading every day or every week during the year.<p>3. Donâ€™t trust your own opinion or back your judgment until the action of the market itself confirms your opinion.<p>4. Markets are never wrong â€“ opinions often are.<p>5. The real money made in speculating has been in commitments showing a profit right from the start.<p>6. As long as a stock is acting right, and the market is right, do not be in a hurry to take profits.<p>7. One should never permit speculative ventures to run into investments.<p>8. The money lost by speculation alone is small compared with the gigantic sums lost by so-called investors who have let their investments ride.<p>9. Never buy a stock because it has a big decline from its previous high.<p>10. Never sell a stock because it seems high-priced.<p>11. I become a buyer as a stock makes a new high on its movement after having had a normal reaction.<p>12. Never average losses.<p>13. The human side of every person is the greatest enemy of the average speculator.<p>14. Wishful thinking must be banished.<p>15. Big movements take time to develop.<p>16. It is not good to be too curious about all the reason behind price movements.<p>17. It is much easier to watch a few than many.<p>18. If you cannot make money out of the leading active issues, you are not going to make money out of the market as a whole.<p>19. The leaders of today may not be the leaders of two years from now.<p>20. Do not become completely bearish or bullish on the whole market because one stock in some particular group has plainly reversed its course from the general trend.<p>21.

I recently converted a Rails project to Grails (actually, I'm in the middle of the conversion).  I'd thought ""it's Rails - we'll just go in and fix the current issues"".  It was a horrid nightmare of undocumented crap.  It was started in 2006 - Rails 1, and had been added on to for nearly 4 years, and was still Rails 1 (1.2).  No useful inline comments, no unit tests, undocumented magic method overrides for basic stuff that wasn't compatible with future Rails versions, and so on.  It was horrid.  But hey, it's Rails, right?  Must be magically better than PHP!<p>I went back and forth on whether to rewrite in PHP or Grails, and either would have been fine.  Why?  Because part of the rewrite process is to use modern techniques - with a big helping of TDD tempering the process.  Oh, and version control.  Yeah - 4 years of a project with 0 version control is not fun to deal with.<p>So... I'll take PHP with a team of people using sane schedules, TDD/testing, version control, internal and external documentation, and other niceties, over Ruby for the sake of Ruby.  Now, modern Ruby/Rails with all those niceties vs PHP with same niceties?  Probably a more even draw, with no clear cut choice.  But that doesn't seem to be brought up in these discussions.<p>Frankly, most of the stuff people point to as awesome about Ruby (or Groovy, in my case) in isolation can be detriment - metaprogramming in general can be confusing to someone new to the code without proper documentation as to what's being done.  Whether those docs are in tests, inline or external is beside the point.  Typically when I come in to a new code base in any language the documentation just doesn't exist (or, better yet, it's ""self-documenting""... right...).<p>End of rant - PHP really is fine when used with proper development techniques.  Most languages are.

A completely closed system would cut developers off at the knees. Which would put Apple on the hook to develop every piece of software for their ecosystem.

I think rather Apple sees an opportunity to provide a sales channel where they get a cut of other people work by acting as the distributor and in turn do things like guarantee that the app if free of malicious actions and compatible with OSX systems.<p>As for Java, I knew this one was coming, Jobs and Ellison are good friends and Apple and Oracle are the only two companies that either are not at war with, they really don't compete in each other spaces. So I think Jobs is comfortable with Oracle providing the JVM for their platform.<p>I am sure that Steve has resigned any worry in his head that Java is going to achieve desktop dominance so it is not a Trojan horse to his platform where it will be used to provide OSX apps in preference over the native OSX development technologies.<p>Giving it back to Oracle means that the developers get the latest JVM at the same time as everyone else not waiting up to a year as the cycle comes around itself. I think it is a good move on both companies parts. I just wonder why Steve always has to be so vague.

Maybe I could, but I my conscience can't deal with persenting them with that list just so that I potentially have more fun while programming.<p>One of the things I'm currently looking into though is Websockets for a specific component of the app and in that case, I SO clearly see a huge advantage in Node.js that I will certainly go node if we decide that the shortcomings in the way we are currently solving that problem warrant the change in the architecture.<p>Which brings me to the same conclusion as my initial post:<p>Rewrite for additional functionality or fixed issues: Yeah. Rewrite for the sake of having it rewritten: I'd rather not.",1287749321

1819337,comment,1818632,1818782,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Very nice summary, thanks for that.<p>> - Music is just like ZUNE.<p>I kind of laughed at the Zune when it came out, but I've recently started to rethink it. There's been a convergence of electronic devices lately - phone, camera, web browser, handheld game device, music player, etc. Every company in any of these markets needs to realize this is happening, and either specialize and focus on their niche (high high end cameras) or be able to make an adequate showing on all the features.<p>Apple realized that music was going on to phones, and they made the iPhone - very smart play getting ahead of the game. Microsoft didn't realize this early enough, and had to rush something to market to catch up, so of course it wasn't going to show as well. Apple had been building and refining music players for a few cycles at that point, so it's unsurprising the Zune wasn't as nice. But they had to do it, because the convergence of music player, phone, computer, browser, camera, gaming, etc. demands it. While the Zune showed poorly, it laid the groundwork for them to eventually have a quality music player. And actually, it might even be possible to pass Apple in music in the near future, because Windows iTunes is really a second citizen. I like my iPhone, but I hate iTunes. I mean, really, really hate it. It's overwhelmingly the most unpleasant and headache-generating software I use.<p>So - I laughed at the Zune at first, but I'm now realizing it was a necessary play. Also, as only one feature on a consolidated device, it doesn't need to be as good as the iPod - only ""good enough"" at music while some other key features exceed.",1287748905

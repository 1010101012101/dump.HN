That is, what would you suggest to get to that place without the straightjacket?<p>Note that at a bare minimum, these supposed tools should give the ability for fine-grained manual resource control, zero-(runtime)-cost abstractions, and performance roughly on-par with C++. As evidence that these hypothetical tools work well for the purpose, we could look for some complex <i>and</i> high-performance software written in them: say, a browser engine, a 3d engine, a kernel, etc., but wait a minute -- these are all things that tend to be written in C++ or plain C.<p>Instead of glibly dismissing the language that&#x27;s used to implement, say, every major browser engine, wouldn&#x27;t it be more productive to ask questions about <i>why</i> people use it? Bonus points if the answer is something more realistic than &quot;They don&#x27;t know Lisp&quot;.<p>That way, you end up trying to figure out how to make a replacement for it that is an actual replacement -- Rust is a fantastically exciting example of this.<p>It&#x27;ll be great when we can all move away from C++, since it&#x27;s a colossal clusterfuck of counterproductive complexity, but &quot;C++ is a bad language&quot; misses the point in a really uninteresting kind of way.",1398045591

China). You can always upgrade it in the future too, if you decide you want a real US Fender birds-eye maple neck or something; start with something cheap in case it doesn&#x27;t work out.

Formal verification was seen as the future for large systems for some short time in the latter half of the 20th century, and since then no one has seriously suggested verifying programs of millions lines of code. The point that is made here (quite sensibly) is that in many cases, by verifying small parts of your codebase (a few hundred lines, perhaps), you can rule out whole classes of bugs.<p>To give some useful real-life exampled, in OCaml (or at least in Standard ML), if a program compiles one can know that it will never crash (i.e. leave the control of the system - it might still abort) unless the compiler has a bug (and there&#x27;s now a verified ML compiler for x64). Other useful properties might be to prove that a driver terminates (Microsoft SLAM/T2) and so will never hang the system, or a compiler that produces code semantically equivalent to the spec of the language.<p>You say that software quality has been harmed by the emphasis of mathematical proof of code - I just don&#x27;t see how this can be the case. In a typical education, a student will see two types of proving code - in an algorithms class, where it is required in order to show that the algorithm solves the problem (and totally separately to actually building software systems), and in the formal verification/model class, which I doubt is taught at many universities and is almost certainly optional.<p>If someone enters the workforce without sufficient knowledge of test driven development, isn&#x27;t taught at their place of work and writes bad code, there&#x27;s a nice long list of people they can blame (their bosses, the people reviewing their code, their style book, their examiners, their lecturers, etc.) but it&#x27;s not valid to blame formal verification for this, no more than it is valid to blame the hypothetical course on FPGA programming they took at some point.<p>Yes, test driven development is great, but it is totally complementary to this sort of thing.",1398044323

It&#x27;s fair to say C++ is becoming increasing accommodating to whatever you want to make of it <i>if</i> you&#x27;re willing to compromise and roll with it. For sure, it&#x27;s one of the very best and most practical languages for writing extremely efficient implementations of algorithms.<p>I highly recommend watching Alex Stepanovs A9 lecture series, &quot;Efficient Programming with Components&quot; [0], where he covers the humble min() function, and variants thereof, for at least ~20 hours. During this time he also takes a minor digression in to writing a memory pool for linked-list nodes, while pointing out similarities in the design to a Lisp. It&#x27;s extremely &#x27;instructive&#x27;, as he would say, in understanding how he writes C++ code. The sheer amount of code will horrify you, it may even seem unproductive, but I think his objective was really to get everyone thinking about the beauty of the algorithms and the details rather than the objective. His concern for performance, correctness of code, and composition of algorithms is interesting and something I haven&#x27;t seen presented in real time, in C++, in such a manner before. One example for instance, are occasions where he insists on writing functions backwards, from the return statement up.<p>If you want a higher level overview on his opinions of C++ and programming etc. The less intense series, &quot;Programming Conversations&quot; [1], is worth a more casual watch.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXryyw91lahwdtpZsmo4BGD"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXryyw91lah...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXFAEA-lYoRNQIezL_vaSX-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXFAEA-lYoR...</a>",1398043215

They could do some shopping, basic housekeeping, watch them take the right medication in the morning.\nIn return the elderly could return the favor by exchanging non-monetary things, like home-made food. Or they could just pay for the students to lower their rent.<p>All those solutions are great, but they require serious building of infrastructure, which can&#x27;t be done immediately.<p>So services like the one described above seem to be an intermediate solution.\nThe problem is that all those &quot;micro-tasks&quot; (take the cleaning the litterbox example) are too easy/short to be paid a sufficient amount of money to be done.

The cost can be shared amongst 6-10 dog owners. While the time spent for walking 6-10 dogs might only double (you need time to collect and return them) instead of increasing 6-10 fold.<p>So the service should bundle and curate requests from a neighborhood or house.\nIf a couple requests are similar, like &quot;I would love someone to clean my windows every X weeks.&quot; They get bundled into a service package for which local contractors provide a quote.\nAnd other people living in the neighborhood can then pledge for the service.

You can sample as many points as you want and you&#x27;ll still be no wiser as to how + behaves and how it interacts with * or that the implementation of + even respects any of those properties. If you&#x27;re going to put in the effort to generate unit tests then why not go a bit further and formally verify the correct functionality?<p>All this is just a roundabout way of saying I don&#x27;t write unit tests. There is no value in it when I have convinced myself each subcomponent is correct and that composition of those subcomponents preserves correctness. You can write all the unit tests in the world and if you don&#x27;t verify that the composition of your components preserves the correctness properties those tests are meant to verify then you might as well not have written those tests because now you have created a false sense of security.<p>If you can verify the kernel pieces of your code and then the composition mechanisms then you&#x27;re done. You don&#x27;t need to verify the entire thing as long as the entire thing is built with the kernel pieces and verified composition mechanisms that preserve correctness.<p>I also suspect we are still talking about separate classes of software. For your run of the mill twitter clone if it makes the corporate overlords happy then write as many unit tests as you want because it doesn&#x27;t make a difference either way.

For much of modern history, he contends, the rate of return on capital has hovered between 4 and 5 percent, while the growth rate has been decisively lower, between 1 and 2 percent. (Piketty makes a compelling case that economic growth, which depends in good part on population growth, is unlikely to accelerate dramatically anywhere but in Africa, given current demographic trends.) Thus he adduces capitalism’s &quot;principal destabilizing force&quot;: Whenever r > g, &quot;capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.&quot;<p>Now that was fascinating",1398042256

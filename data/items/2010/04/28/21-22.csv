What Tasch has in mind is a consistent, sound, 3 or 4 percent return""<p>Is 20% all that much? The way I see it, one has to strive for gains to compensate for losses (in bad years). I am pretty sure 3% gain is not enough to compensate for losses.<p>In the worst case, your product becomes obsolete from one year to the next.

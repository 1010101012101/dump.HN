12203,comment,12201,12201,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Let's take Loopt as an example. Y combinator gives the founders $10,000. They code and live like animals for three months. Their hard work pays off... another VC gives them $5M.<p>At this point, do the founders still have to share a crappy 2 bedroom rental and eat ramen? Or, can they pay themselves $300K a year and use their salaries to put a down payment on a decent condo? ",1176367169

Ahhh.<p>I've read virtually everything on your site and also bought <i>Hackers and Painters</i>. A physical book is super convenient and it's an easy way for me to get new people to start reading your stuff, since many people don't like reading on the web.<p>The more new essays the better of course, but I would truly appreciate getting them when they're fresh baked and not waiting for the book (which I will order the second it's available). I say screw the people who don't appreciate and see the value in both versions.<p>My ultimate format preference would be a spoken ""book on tape"" version of all your essays. That'd be amazingly great fuel for my iPod and I'd happily pay iTunes-type prices.",1176367122

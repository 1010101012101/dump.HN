56974,comment,55974,55974,0,0,chubbard,,,"I know this topic is really already past, but what about a fully up to date web browser.  Full CSS standards compliance, JIT javascript, nice developer tools, memory models, full garbage collection, just the web browser we all want right.  Pay attention because here is the interesting part.  Sell it to Microsoft.  This is not a web browser where you are trying to capture the market.  No just sell it to Microsoft because they aren't going to fix their browser anytime soon.  I imagine they can't.  It's too old, and maintenance has become a nightmare.  That's why their browser is so behind the times.  So, they got a problem, a big one, so someone should fix it for them.",1190224565

56972,comment,56626,56725,0,0,vegashacker,,,"When I read Joel's article, I was imagining in my head a JS-prime => JS + (maybe) CSS compiler, where JS-prime feels just like JS, except it makes it impossible to write something that doesn't work ""the same"" in all browsers.  I think that this would be huge if it existed, except after reading your post, I'm thinking maybe it does already exist.  Yes?<p>Also, could you clarify your statement: ""The most annoying limitations are imposed by the browser (meaning that no JS library is going to fix them).""  Do you mean the there are things that browsers simply can't do (e.g., your ""file uploading that doesn't suck"" example)?",1190224457

56968,comment,56626,56943,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Though if people were really to move towards encrypted mail, it'd threaten the whole webmail industry.  It does no good to encrypt your mail if it's then sent in plain text over the web.  Even if you used https, it's a little nonsensical to let a third party <i>decrypt</i> your mail and then re-encrypt it for transmission.<p>That said, I'd bet that this threatens encrypted mail more than webmail.  Have consumers <i>ever</i> chosen security over convenience?  ",1190223833
56967,comment,56825,56825,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We're announcing a product that manages EC2 instances in the next week or so (along with Solaris Zones, Xen, and vserver instances).  So far we're seeing pretty good results with the people who are using EC2, but reliability is currently less than ideal.  If EC2 were on the various hosting reliability charts I'm pretty sure it'd be down in the bottom half of the pack (and given some of the podunk three-server operations out there calling themselves ""hosting providers"" this is pretty dismal).  As far as I can tell, you can expect several minutes of downtime every month, and sometimes longer.  Most of the top tier hosts average a couple of minutes per year downtime...but the fluid nature of EC2 should make it possible to get near 100% uptime...when Amazon takes a network segment down, they can theoretically do a live migration of your instances.  So far, they don't seem to actually have the capability to do so.<p>The S3 piece of the equation brings it back up in usefulness...but I don't know that I'd want to rely on it exclusively for my web applications just yet, unless high volume storage was a core part of my problem domain.",1190223748

56965,comment,56618,56749,0,0,axiom,,,"There is definitely some of that. After all the book is targeted towards a popular audience. But that being said there are a couple of remarkably original ideas.<p>For example, going from least to most intersting:<p>1. Statistically speaking a child is much more likely to drown in a swimming pool than be killed by a gun (of course, corrected for socioeconomic status and all the standard stuff.) Yet we see countless campaigns against gun violence with the argument that x number of kids get killed due to guns, and none for ""swimming pool safety"" or a host of other things that are far more likely to kill you.<p>2. There is a study of a daycare center where a problem they were dealing with was parents picking up kids late. So the daycare instituted fines. The result was more parents picking up their kids late. Why? because after conducting interviews they found that the guilt associated with being late was more of a motivator than the small fine. Having paid the fine, the parents no longer felt as bad about being late. That's a very conterintuitive result if you ask me.<p>3. The famous abortion-crime link. The idea being that the legalization of abortion in the 70s is what caused the massive decrease in violent crime in the 90s. Very convincingly argued. And certainly presents a better theory than The Tipping Point.<p>Anyway. There's more where that came from.",1190223611

56960,comment,56825,56845,0,0,gojomo,,,"That post (""Amazon EC2 + S3 Doesn't Cut it for Real Applications"") contains a false statement which the author has not corrected, even though commenters there quickly pointed out its falsehood. The falsehood is: ""There is no persistent storage in EC2 so if your virtual server goes down for any reason such as taking it down to install security patches or a system crash, all your data is lost.""<p>Instances can reboot, under operator control or due to a crash, and still retain their existing hard drive storage. Only less frequent 'instance termination' causes a loss of hard drive contents. <p>True, there are no guarantees that any instance won't be terminated by Amazon or other system failures at any time, so you're supposed to have your own backup and persistence strategy. But in practice, full terminations are rare, and Amazon has even given warnings when system upgrades mean large instance turnover is expected. (Though, there is no guarantee they will do so.)<p>So the falsehoods above are ""[data is lost] if your virtual server goes down for any reason"" and both concrete examples given, ""taking it down to install security patches"" and ""system crash"".

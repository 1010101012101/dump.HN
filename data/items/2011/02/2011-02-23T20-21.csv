My biggest hope was that mechanics must submit car fix reports to the state DMV, and that these databases would be open (since DMV is supported by taxpayers).

2255751,comment,2254951,2255024,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"So the executive summary is the first effort didn't work and now you're trying something different? I would be curious if you've got any postmortem analysis for the last effort.<p>But more. I would like to offer a simple theory for why no ""making search as easy as possible"" site is going succeed. My explanation is that this is because <i>job search is an adversarial process.</i> It is, at least partially, a zero sum game. Neither player wants to remove the information-asymmetry on the part of their opponent in such a game. For example, forcing the other side to <i>work</i> for information about you is good because it impels the other side to be <i>committed</i> to you (and the other side concomitantly hates having to work for their information).<p>The fact that neither side is very rational either doesn't help. It's in my interest not to reveal my love of Labrador Retrievers to my potential employers because it's more likely they will reject me for this than that they will accept me for it.<p>Just consider - an employers wants to know everything good and bad about an employee before they make that employee an offer. A potential employee wants the opposite - they want to know all the potential jobs available, where each company is in their search and what offers said companies are willing to make <i>before</i> they start revealing information about themselves. Then they want the employer to know all the desirable things about them. Then they want the employer to know any negative that they'd forced to tell anyway. And they don't want to describe any potential negatives that the employer won't need to know. <i>AND</i> what's negative and what's a positive varies from employer to employer. What potential employees certainly shouldn't want is a ""beauty contest"" where they ""strut their stuff"" to invisible judges. But naturally, neither side can or should get everything they want here.<p>The adversarial situation of job search is the ultimate reason for its clunkiness. It's complex dance involving each side revealing information and making commitments. The ability of each <i>to</i> make commitments is important to the process as well as long as the commitment process is reasonably <i>symmetrical</i> (why my committing to a mere ""job search"" by paying money is highly disadvantageous. I only commit to specific employers <i>after</i> they had <i>partially</i> committed to me). It's a reason that job-shops exist despite seeming ignorant and irrational. It's the same reason that find ""contracting agents who understands programming"" to be the worst to deal with (the contracting agent isn't there to evaluate you, they're just a mediation a way for both sides to unveil their information slowly. They work good for only that).",1298494386

She was employee number four. This company figured that since it was chock full of highly technical people, they had no real need for an established IT department or any sort of formal policy for servers or services on site.<p>Guess what the password to their payroll server was?<p>Despite having grown from a small start-up to a respectably financially successful company in less than a decade (note: BEFORE the dot.com bubble, mind you), once their staff of technical people found out that some techs were being paid more than others... well, you can imagine what happened. My mother was one of the last people out the door.<p>Every time I read or hear someone shrug off the importance of IT, complain about policies or refer to IT staff as a 'cost center', I am reminded of how 'mainstream' staff still have a lot of trouble wrapping their minds around how much trouble one badly behaved employee can cause. Even when there is an established IT department, it usually suffers from such a paucity of resources and effective management that the enterprise network... well, the word 'bloodbath' comes to mind.<p>And now I'm going to start a stopwatch to see how much time elapses before tptacek makes me delete this comment. :-)",1298494231

I think some of the recent valuations for companies with many users but no profit nor any obvious business model are dubious at best. However, I think the valuations for companies that depend exclusively on one framework/inftrastructure base provided by another mega-valued company are downright crazy. Companies like Facebook have come and gone before, and when they go, they often disappear into relative obscurity pretty quickly after losing critical mass. Investing heavily in a company built on that foundation is compounding two very high risk strategies, which doesn't sound very smart to me. But then, I'm not a billionaire VC, so maybe I just don't get it. :-)",1298494221

There is no one-size-fits-all approach, not even a one-size-fits-many.  At best we have a series of one-size-may-fit-you-if-you're-lucky options.  Disqus isn't using NoSQL or Nginx, something a good number of scaled web applications have switched to.  Why?  It doesn't solve their problem.  Why is their problem different from others?  That's a long and complex answer that revolves around almost every aspect of how their applications run, access data, what types of data they're accessing, and so on, and so forth.<p>Is the problem their algorithm? Does it spend a long amount of CPU time working away?  Could it be written a different way?
Is it data access, is the lag caused by queries taking to long?
Is that down to badly formatted queries, inefficient schema, server problems or something else?
Is it even a single problem or a combination of a multitude of minor little niggles that combine into a big headache?
Do you do thousands of little queries, or smaller numbers of big ones?  Are your tables narrow or wide?  What size and types of data do you store in the fields?<p>A number of the things that Disqus have done to scale out aren't appropriate for other environments, by nature of the fundamentals of the app.  All they can advise on is how to scale your python/Django/MySQL based commenting system, but even then your approach to writing one might be different to theirs.<p>Quite simply, no one can tell you how to scale your application and its infrastructure, because every application and infrastructure is unique by the very nature of every problem being unique, and every solution more so.<p>That's not to say there is no value in the information that Disqus has provided.  Quite the contrary, there is every bit of value there, and I greatly appreciate them posting it.  There is a good chance that whilst some of what they've done won't be of use to you, some of it may be.  It may even be of use for other reasons that are entirely different from those that benefit Disqus.<p>Quick example.  You want to load balance web traffic, what do you chose for it?  Is software of hardware best? Do you do lots of SSL (would an SSL Accelerator be of use?)  Do you want the servers to directly respond to the client, or respond through the load balancers?<p>Apache httpd+mod_proxy
Nginx
HAProxy
ldirectord
lighttpd<p>You want to add in caching:
Varnish
Apache Traffic Server
Squid

The relationship of NeXT to this discussion (about Microsoft's inability to correctly implement something they invented and that they want others to implement too - because it's a standard after all) escapes me.<p>Attributing Netscape's demise to a rewrite of the browser is a bit exaggerated. They were under enormous pressure with a company with more resources to spend monthly than their entire market cap and giving away a browser bundled with Windows. The pressure to deliver new versions made them cut corners and allowed the browser to accumulate an enormous quantity of kludges that culminated with the need to throw it out and restart from scratch.<p>If anything, they should have been rewriting from the start, never allowing the cruft build up. It's an investment that pays back more often than not, specially if you are under the pressure to deliver new features quickly.<p>BTW, your fixation with Netscape is interesting too. You brought it up and tried to reason I did. That's also something that escapes me.<p>Why would a full rewrite of Microsoft Office be so expensive?

First, Sun retained veto power via the threat of patents over ODF.

If they wanted to derail attempts to take ODF in a direction that they did not approve of, they could withdraw from the committee leaving the standard unprotected from their patents.<p>Second, Sun made it clear that ODF was only going to have those features necessary to support Star Office.

IE it never was a 'friendship' friendship to begin with.<p>In other words, it's not that the other CEO is no longer going to have you over for Thanksgiving Dinner but that you may now have strategically pissed of a valuable strategic partner.<p>Too many variables really to be able to cover a blanket one-size-all rule but I do think I would pass if the employee was in a vital role at a key vendor that would seriously damage my business if the vendor re-negotiated terms or withdrew service.  Which they could in spite or even simply out of a perceived new conflict of interest with IP transfer in the hire.",1298491539

Real innovation often takes a long time to catch on, since by definition it goes against conventional wisdom. VCs don't want to get rich slowly, and entrepreneurs are following their lead in chasing hockey-stick growth curves, which are a lot easier to come by in fashion than they are in technology.",1298491467

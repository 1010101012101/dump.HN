8721072,comment,8719371,8720966,0,0,colah3,,,"Certainly!<p>* The biggest one is probably just train for a very long time. Competitive neural nets for many tasks are trained on GPUs, clusters, or GPU clusters, for days or weeks.<p>* Using convolutional layers really helps. Roughly, convolutional layers have multiple copies of the same neuron, applied to different inputs. This results in them needing to learn much less. It also leads to them kind of concentrating the gradient on just a few neurons. Because of this, if the first few layers of a network are convolutional layers, they are much easier to train. For a long time, these were the only kind of remotely deep neural networks we could train.<p>(I wrote a blog post on conv nets, which you can read here: <a href=""http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/</a>)<p>* So far, Michael&#x27;s book has only talked about sigmoid neurons (I think). But you can use neurons with other activation functions. They still multiply their inputs by different weights and add a bias, but instead of applying sigmoid they apply a different function. Using a different kind of neuron, ReLU neurons, tends to help a lot. Unlike sigmoid neurons, which tend to have a very small derivative, ReLU neurons have a derivative of 1 a lot of the time. I&#x27;ve had mixed experiences, but most people swear by them.<p>* Using higher learning rates for early layers may be helpful.",1418100059

Supports seamless interaction through an inter-application messaging mechanism called plumber (e.g. you can write a rule that will make all ISBN numbers in a desktop application automatically act as a hyperlink to a web application).<p>* The rc shell fixes a lot of deficiencies in the Bourne shell.<p>* Per-process namespaces obsolete a whole lot of things like symlinks.<p>* There is no superuser (root account). This is obsoleted by an auth server called Factotum.<p>* Uses its own compiler suite that makes cross-compilation particularly easy, compared to the mess of doing so with GCC. It also uses its own much cleaner libc routines that are quite distinct from POSIX or the messy glibc additions of today. Has its own thread library, as well.<p>* All network information is held in a text file database mounted on a file server.<p>* The default file system (Venti) is inherently versioned, introspectable and has backup built into it. You can do things like swap in libraries from cache and revert changes without a hitch.<p>* Everything is statically linked.<p>* Uses mk instead of make.<p>* A lot of things like recursive copy and find aren&#x27;t built into the standard commands. It&#x27;s expected you actually chain together commands instead of reinventing the wheel for every single operation. The canonical example is the use of du to walk the file system tree, for everything. This replaces find and other things.<p>* Designed not just to be multi-user, but multi-tenant. Makes many uses for containers and access controls unneeded because of its core design.<p>* So much more.<p>Try it. It&#x27;s more relevant now than ever.",1418099533

I‚Äôll point to some recent fine work by Martin Kleppmann (<a href=""https://github.com/ept/hermitage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ept/hermitage</a>) that explores the issue and shows how many systems fall short of serializable isolation in their default modes. (And sometimes in modes labeled ‚Äúserializable‚Äù!) In his test three databases actually achieve full serializability: PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, and FoundationDB.<p>But don‚Äôt give up on ACID yet! If can actually get real serializability, you have a very powerful model that is also very simple to reason about. Serializable isolation gives you a virtual ‚Äúwhole database lock‚Äù that lets you modify lots of things all over the database before you ‚Äúunlock‚Äù it and hand the database to the next client.

8720975,comment,8718596,8720554,0,0,eridius,,,"> Now installing software not from the MAS is a warning<p>No it&#x27;s not. Where did you get that idea? The only issue is installing software that isn&#x27;t codesigned with an Apple-signed certificate. Any developer enrolled in Apple&#x27;s Mac Developer program can get an Apple-signed certificate and self-sign their 3rd-party non-MAS software and users will have the same experience as using MAS software. The only dialog they&#x27;ll get is the standard &quot;Are you sure you want to run this program you just downloaded?&quot; dialog that we&#x27;ve had for a while now. Which, admittedly, I don&#x27;t think MAS apps have, but that&#x27;s because MAS apps aren&#x27;t downloaded with a web browser; if you install a 3rd-party app via some mechanism other than downloading with a web browser it should similarly bypass that dialog.<p>> installing software from a developer entirely unblessed by Apple entirely is disabled without already knowing the &quot;right click workaround&quot; (try successfully explaining to a casual user how to install that kind of app)<p>Well, the simple answer is to change the Gatekeeper setting, but the more relevant question is why are you even providing support for such an app? Any app that isn&#x27;t properly code-signed is likely to not have had an update in several years. The only excuse beyond old unsupported apps for not properly being code-signed is the rare open-source cross-platform app that provides an OS X download without codesigning, which is not something most casual users are generally expected to be using anyway.<p>All of this is beside the point anyway. Gatekeper and the Mac App Store are two completely separate technologies. And whether or not your application is distributed on the MAS is not relevant to Gatekeeper, except in that you cannot distribute on the MAS if your app is not properly codesigned.<p>> It&#x27;s only logical to extrapolate that to the next steps. maybe in 2015 all non-MAS will require the right-click open. In 2016 or 2017 non-MAS will probably mean not runnable without obtaining a limited-use developer or enterprise certificate from Apple for a fee.<p>That&#x27;s pure 100% FUD. It is not at all logical to assume that Apple will pull such an insanely stupid move. iOS being locked down does not at all say that OS X will be locked down in the same fashion; it would be virtually impossible to lock down OS X like that, and any attempt to do so would be so incredibly user-hostile that it&#x27;s laughable to think Apple would do that, and would probably destroy OS X.<p>I have to wonder if you have some vested interest in sowing distrust in Apple and OS X. Why else would you make such an absurd claim with a straight face?",1418098111

From what I understand, Uber drivers are independent contractors and determine their own working hours and working days. I also had the impression that Uber drivers can turn their &quot;available&quot; signal on and off at will. So many of them run their own private car companies and switch the &quot;Uber available&quot; app off while handling their own rides. They&#x27;re required to accept rides only when their signal is &quot;on&quot;.<p>Moreover, I think you&#x27;re underestimating an important effect: which is that significant events like snowstorms, maybe sporting events will affect both supply and demand. The impact may not be something that anyone can forecast.<p>When the Uber surge price rises to 6x normal, new supply will enter the system, and demand will leave it. Say an Uber driver is relaxing at home and did not plan to work today. He receives a notification that fare is now 6x normal. That will entice him to work today, even if he wasn&#x27;t planning to. Or a driver that works predominately in a different area might travel to the area that needs more drivers. Etc. The fact that price can fluctuate in this way ensures that sufficient supply is available. The high price literally creates supply. There is no economic incentive for a taxi driver to come into work on his day off in order to give rides in a snowstorm if he&#x27;ll receive the same prices the following day.<p>Similarly, when the price rises to 6x, Uber users might decide to call a friend for a ride, instead of taking an Uber, ensuring that people who have alternative means of transportation use them, leaving the drivers available for those who wish to pay or have no alternatives.<p>Thinking through all the side effects and eventualities, the fact that price can fluctuate according to supply and demand provides a significant benefit in the way of allowing more rides to occur.",1418098073

The key preventive thing to do is not to avoid looking at things that are blurry images, but to make sure to vary one's eyes' focal length continually throughout the day. Most outdoor sports with balls in rapid motion (soccer, backyard baseball or football or basketball, etc.) pretty much ensure this. My second son's vision has actually improved in the last two years from almost needing glasses for myopia back to not needing any vision correct as he stays active on his town club traveling soccer team, which trains year-round. (He LOVES to read and spends many hours in front of the computer writing stories too, but I make sure he gets outdoor play every day, all winter and all seasons.) Vary your eye focus to preserve the best vision you can with the shuffle of genes you were born with.",1260892798

996697,comment,996440,996440,0,0,jerf,,,"This whole patent is annoying because it reflects something that has been bothering me about the web for a long time. We built this enormous architecture that is built on TCP/IP, then carefully, oh-so-carefully made damn sure that it was much, much less functional than the base it was built on. Only recently are we sort of getting back to the base capabilities of TCP/IP with web sockets, and by the very phrase ""web sockets"" you can guess that they're a bit mucked up. Which they are.<p>It should hardly be patent-worthy when somebody figures out a way to undo the damage done to TCP/IP by a higher layer. <i>Obviously</i> TCP/IP is useful, why would it be remotely surprising that bi-directional communication is a good idea? It's not like the implementations are that surprising; channels of data are channels of data. Anyone who doesn't find that an obvious statement is not ""skilled in the art"".<p>I suppose I should rush out to file a patent on layering SSL back onto web sockets. Or proxying web sockets back to real sockets. If somebody hasn't already.",1260892570

It does anything you can imagine, including a jQuery-like interface if you really like bad interfaces.  :)  Or you can write your own OO interface.<p>jQuery is _downstream_ from My Library.  If you go back a couple of years in CLJ, you'll find that I'm the one who tirelessly argued with Resig and co. until they dumped UA sniffing.  And yeah, they copy code and ideas from me to this day.  But that is _not_ why I point out the botched implementations of those (and other) ideas.  I point them out because the code is bullshit.<p>All of that stuff about improved development time and readability and support for whatever browsers misses the mark (no pun intended) as well.<p>* The others are not more readable\n* The others are not more advanced (despite my Write Once, Do Nothing strategy).\n* The others are not more compatible (not even close)\n* The others do not perform better\n* The others do not have better support (the authors are too confused about what they are writing or copying)<p>The only thing the others have going for them is that they actually (disingenuously) market their projects.  I don't have the time or need to do so.<p>The library is only 330K if you select _everything_ in the builder, which is the equivalent of jQuery + 100 plug-ins.  It's got easily the best Flash module, a unique audio module, ""sidebar"" widgets, a CSS selector query engine, animations (including DirectX), etc., etc. And it all works going back a decade or so and continues to work going forward (I rarely touch it).  And contrary to the laughable comment I saw in here, it perfectly suitable for use in the ""Real World"".  That expression is so tired (and meaningless usually) it is in a coma.  I sometimes wonder if the people who write things like ""Real World"" and ""snark"" actually talk like that.  :)<p>I don't know what you mean by ""simply not notable"".  On technical, usability and compatibility merits, it's the most notable blob of cross-browser JS ever published.  But I never really called attention to it other than as a way for others (e.g. Resig) to learn.  When it came out, all of the frameworks were doing crap like this:-<p>if (isIE6) {\n} else if (isSafari || isIE8)\n}<p>...and about to collapse under the weight of all of these flaky forks.

Here's some anecdotal data:<p><i>Baseball:</i><p>- Fox pays MLB $625 million per year to show the World Series, every other NLCS and ALCS, the All-Star game, and 26 Sunday Night games. In addition, Fox pays $43 million per year for an additional 2 games during the week with no exclusivity.<p>- Simultaneously, TBS pays for one Sunday afternoon game per week, and the remaining NLCS and ALCS games not shown on Fox. I couldn't find a price-tag, but based on similar deals $200MM/year is about right.<p>- On top of that, ESPN pays $80 million per year for 2 games on Wednesday and the Sunday night game.<p>- In addition, the rest of the games are sold to major and local networks. There are > 2400 MLB games in the regular season alone.<p><i>Football:</i><p>- ESPN pays $1.1 billion per year just to show the Monday Night Football game<p>- NBC pays $600 million per year for the Sunday night game. Interestingly, the Sunday night game is the most expensive 30 second spot on a recurring TV program, at $400,000 per spot.<p>- If you're at all familiar with the NFL, you'll know about the ongoing drama between the NFL network, Comcast, TWC, and DirecTV. I don't know what DirecTV is paying for the rights to broadcast every game, but I would be shocked if its less than $1 billion per year.<p>And that's just some of baseball and football.

996635,comment,996459,996512,0,0,latortuga,,,"One of the biggest is that anonymous functions typically are less verbose in terms of syntax required. This is really dependent upon the language you're working with but two pretty decent examples from languages I work with are Ruby and javascript. In javascript, an anonymous function is just a normal function with no name:<p><pre><code>  function(){ return ""i'm anonymous""; }\n\n  function namer(){ return ""i'm a named function""; }\n</code></pre>\nIn Ruby, blocks are a syntactic sugar for anonymous functions:<p><pre><code>  [1,2,3,4].each {|num| print i } # => 1234\n  \n  [1,2,3,4].each do |num| print i; end # => 1234\n</code></pre>\nIn javascript a named function is very similar to an anonymous one - they can both be bound to variables, both be passed to other functions, both be returned from functions. I believe the biggest difference you'll find is that some languages enable you to write them with very little trouble (e.g. the ruby given above, simply brackets with an arg list) while some require more extensive declaration. Another good contrast of this is javascript, which doesn't even require that you give a function a formal parameter list, with (hypothetically) Java which will need both a return type and the types of each argument.<p>Also that stackoverflow link is pretty good :)",1260891236

Obviously this is absurd, but perhaps more so is that the patent system upholds this kind of nonsense.  I wonder if the patent office reviewers have any perception of how their collective foolishness can disrupt the marketplace for good and evil.  I was hoping to argue that this lawsuit may further the adoption of WebSockets (<a href=""http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/</a>) but after reading portions of the patent I have to say that I wouldn't be surprised if Eolas claims WebSockets fall under their ludicrous jurisdiction of ""clients manipulating data objects"".<p>Here's a decent sitepoint article on the matter: <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/11/05/violating-eolas-ajax-patent/#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/11/05/violating-eolas-aj...</a>",1260889805

My brother has been wearing glasses since he was about 8. My mom wore glasses for a while back in the 80's when she was working as a secretary (I think? Something that put her in front of a computer all day...), but after she left that job her vision quickly restored back to 20/20. Now, as she's getting older, she sometimes needs reading glasses, but I think that's more a function of age than anything else.",1260889757

In other words, automatically compute how interesting the item is based on how the masses liked it in aggregate, how individuals with similar tastes to you liked it, how similar the item is to other items that you have liked, etc.",1260889704

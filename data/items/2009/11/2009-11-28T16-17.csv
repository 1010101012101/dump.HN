So it is known (from the other emails about tree-ring data not corresponding with thermometer readings after the 1960s or something) that some correction is needed. So it seems plausible that a researcher starts with some crude correction to test things out, before they take the time to find the proper adjustments. This is probably just some throwaway code (like approximating pi = 3,14 before you take the time to make an algorithm for calculating Pi to higher precision). I don't think it ended up in a chart that was presented to Obama in person.<p>The whole case looks very, very weak, and to be honest, I just lost a whole lot of respect for ESR. Climate change be true or not, I don't like brainless mob behavior.<p>I think the problem again is with the wording, ""artificial"" can mean different things - again take your pick depending on what you want to believe.<p>In the end, I don't see how ""artifical charts"" like that could end up in scientific papers.

If so, you would end up with a building whose core infrastructure was not designed to make it efficient to service and run a 100 room hotel. That is what can happen with a lean startup.

They allow you to string along a mediocre business for years while keeping your day job and justifying the whole thing by saying you are lean.</i><p>The above comment brings it back to development of the founder as an entrepreneur.

In our case, there are a great deal of skeptics who deny there are any advantages to something that isn't SQL. No amount of arguing can convince them otherwise.<p>So I don't argue with them, it' a waste of my time. That's not to say it's a waste of time, but it's a waste of <i>my</i> time. I continue to work on the project, make it better, grow the user base, etc. But I don't engage the skeptics, I let the code and real successes stand on it's own, and others can argue in it's defense if they are so inclined (and many are).<p>Anyway, for climatologists, the easiest way to deal with the skeptics is make as much data and methodology as possible public and easily accessible. Skeptics will still argue against it, but others will take up the fight of arguing for it. If it's possible that people will argue passionately about a new style of database, it stands to reason there's a whole army of people ready to take up the fight of supporting your data, methodologies and conclusions when it involves the entire Earth's climate.<p>And if the skeptics finds something in your research people can't defend, maybe your data or methods are flawed and need improvement.

Giving out benefits to people not producing value is very bad for them.</i><p>These are people that have already produced significant value for a company, so the notion that this is ""charity"" is really pushing it.<p>Given that many countries are having serious economic problems because of low birth rates, there is a strong need to encourage people to have children; ensuring that they don't go broke and lose their jobs as a result of having kids and properly taking care of them is not a knee jerk reaction, it has a very important economic function.<p><i>Extending a lot of benefits to men will just ""equalize"" the reluctance to hire.</i><p>...and the market should correct for this by reducing wages by exactly the amount necessary to cover the lost productivity.<p>While we're on the topic of higher order effects: removing these benefits from women would cause an increase in wages, as well as a disincentive to have children.  That disincentive to have children has a real economic cost, and I'm not seeing any effects that would tend to offset that.<p>I would question whether this is really a knee-jerk reaction - to me, it seems to have many of the qualities of useful government intervention, in that nobody would be likely to offer it on their own, but it has positive value to the overall economy if everyone does it (in other words, the second order population growth benefits are spread throughout the country, so there's no direct incentive for an individual company to do their part to spend money to cause them, a typical prisoner's dilemma situation).",1259425297

965241,comment,965148,965197,0,0,patio11,,,"That is true.  I think the core benefit of the lean startup thing is that you'll be debugging something that people actually want and are paying for rather than debugging something which may be released to an uncaring world 18 months from now, if it gets released at all.<p>With regards to his point about building a hotel whose core infrastructure doesn't support 100 rooms: I think, based on the dissatisfaction with having to support customers and the price point, that he is probably talking more about scaling per-customer interaction rather than scaling in a technical sense.  Scaling in a technical sense is a) a nice problem to have, kind of like having to hold your pants up because the number of Benjamins in your pockets keeps threatening to tear them off of you (hint: buy a belt) and b) is largely a solved problem for sites with less users than most nation states.<p>So can the lean startup help you scale out of that CS issue?    I think so.  First, if you treat CS incidents/bugs/etc as things to be optimized away, constant small improvements will mean you get less and less CS incidents per customer as time goes on.  (Find what gives people trouble.  Fix it.  Repeat.  I get less than 1/6th as many tech support requests per sale now as I did when I started out.)<p>Second, if you find your current pricing isn't attracting quite the sort of customers you want, you can always change pricing for new customers.  Grandfather in the existing folks at $4 a month, and then carefully consider whether you want to be serving the market that values their data less than they do a frothy Starbucks drink.  ""Charge more"" fixes more CS issues than any other single solution.  It also has some nice side effects, such as getting you more money.",1259425284

It's like Christmas has come early here on HN.<p>And the story just keeps getting better and better, too. Lots of twists and turns.<p>So now we have code comments which are incendiary put ahead of, as it turn out, dead code. It's as if we found IRS code that had pieces in it like ""This part makes sure all environmentalists get audited"" but then the next part never runs. So it looks awful, but it does nothing.<p>So I guess that's the key for any kind of code analysis, right? What does it do? You run the code. Has anybody taken the raw input and ran the code to make sure this piece of code is currently representative of the code used at the time?<p>No wait -- we can't do that, can we? Because <i>the data was lost/destroyed</i>, right? So we have some <i>version</i> of some abstract pieces of code with incriminating comments in them that aren't being ran. On one hand, if you're looking for some kind of solid proof of scientists gone wild, you're never going to find it -- no matter how many times you add up nothing and nothing you'll get nothing -- <i>because there are data and reproducibility problems that we can never resolve</i> So it's always going to be he-said, she-said. On the other hand, that's been the problem with this issue all along -- data, models, and reproducibility. This case just brings it all out into the glorious sunshine for programmers like us to view.<p>Outstanding.",1259424207

Of course not.<p>This is how science should work; both scientists, their competitors, and anyone else with a passing interest will carefully try to discredit existing work. In this case, it looks like a specific attempt to discredit it failed.<p>You are correct that creating proper charts off proper data would be the best solution. Unfortunately, much of the data has been ""lost"", making this impossible.",1259424164

With laws in Germany and Canada that forbade even questioning the number of people that was killed, one begins to wonder if that debate ever happened. The question comes up: ""What are they trying to hide with laws?"".<p>I personally think that Holocaust happened - but I am not so convinced that the ""official"" number is accurate.<p>The best antidote for any skepticism is clear and open debate.",1259424137

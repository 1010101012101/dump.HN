Especially in Europe where the most read printed news sources are tabloids, it's difficult seeing something that tends to be high quality like ReadWriteWeb being shortchanged.  Honestly, I've never even really thought of it as a blog; it's a tech news site run on a blogging platform.",1234601846

I feel like Microsoft strategy is a blunt object that they hurl at anything their competitors touch.  It's almost a little painful to watch.

480966,comment,479314,479469,0,0,yason,,,"If there are two programmers and they both produce exactly the same output, but the differences are as follows:<p>The first programmer has spent a lot more time in doing it (like 5x the second programmer) and carefully verified each line to make sure the code and algorithm are correct both conceptually and in practice, and tested that the code won't fail in any of the imaginable corner cases.<p>The second programmer wrote it over the weekend, didn't test much else but merely cross-checked the code with a few working test cases similar to what the program will be used with for starters. He maybe followed his intuition to guide how to write or let his creative flow dictate the details of the program but he really hasn't had time to verify why.<p>There seems to be no clear notion of which programmer was more productive. It all depends on what perspective the project is viewed. On the other hand, I believe there's always some absolute value underneath and productivity isn't entirely an subjective property.<p>(Mandatory car analogy: If you want a Trabant and I sell you a Mercedes-Benz for the price of a Trabant and you still treat the car like a Trabant, the Mercedes is still better built regardless of how you extract value out of it.)<p>When the project was deployed, both programs worked correctly as they are similar. The cost per line/token of the first programmer is five times the cost of the second programmer. On the other hand, had the second programmer undergone the same rigorous verification it would have taken 2x the time of the first programmer.<p>Apparently the first programmer's code has a lot more value simply in being well-thought, and the programmer knows exactly why he has arrived in the solutions he wrote in the code. If the code broke the programmers would be on very different levels with regard to how to start debugging. On the other hand, the second programmer produced the same program in 1/5th of the time which may greatly please the management. However, the second programmer might easily become a grand failure in the next project as in this project he already reached the same solution if not by accident then at least by luck. Both programmers produced the same comments as they wrote it mainly for the future maintainers, as usual, instead of as a record of the whole mental process they experienced.",1234600184

480956,comment,480707,480864,0,0,psadauskas,,,"I googled without luck, but I remember reading a study awhile ago that demonstrated that Imperial is easier for a human to estimate. Of the the experiments was asking for people familiar in each to guess the length of some objects. The people who gave an answer in feet and inches were more accurate than people using centimeters.<p>They postulated that it was because the values in the Imperial system ""evolved"", and are they way they are because of their convenience for measuring objects in a human scale. Eg, when eyeballing something hand-sized, its easier to pick out a few inches than it is dozens of centimeters.<p>I'll post a link to that article if I can find it.",1234599080

On the other hand, if you just want to speak, you can spend relatively little time on grammatical features like the dual, because many spoken dialects barely use them.<p>The real barrier for me though has been that Arabic (like Hebrew) is written without the short vowels in all text except for children's books and religious texts.

2909217,comment,2906964,2908828,1,0,Dn_Ab,,,"You are right that many people don't need the results of type theory for their work. But that mainly tells on the type of work you do. For example many people think programming does not need math but if you are writing physics engines, graphics engines or doing machine learning then you need some basic level of mathematical sophistication. Similarly, if your work is related to automatic verification or the transformation from code to code then knowing type theory will save you a lot of wasted effort reinventing pitfalls. Type theory gives a foundation and a why basis so that intuition can be augmented beyond rules of thumbs. Language Oriented programming is one which would benefit from such a knowledge. Consider also that the future is not going to be dominated by one platform, powerful code transformation tools will be a strategic advantage. Know that my emphasis is not on the strength of the type system just its consistency and ability to augment human reasoning.<p>Software engineering is the only field of engineering whose practitioners do not use a basics grounded in math. Electrical people have Maxwell, ohm, gauss etc. Mechanical engineers and dynamics, civil continuums and so on. None of these professions you will note, came after the math. The math came as a result from studying and generalizing on these and then feeding the results back providing a net gain for both. This leads me to believe we are in early stages yet. We have the catapult without trigonometry. We do not have enough understanding to build stuff to withstand earthquakes. You say that most languages don't have well founded types but you fail to note that many of those same projects often have massive teams, massive code bases, fail often, run over time and are insecure.<p>But all that said, programming is different isn't it? You can get instant feedback and build something that you think is good because it fits all the white swans you put inside it. So I think before we have a foundation we will need tools that are built from and require a basic understanding of category theory and types. These can then be used to quickly iterate tests and do so with strong guarantees without having to write annoyingly tedious constructive proofs. Genetic programming is stupid but what if it could reason about types and try hypothesis on a meta level as well? Or what if tools such as <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1178"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1178</a> were developed into the typical programmers toolchain?

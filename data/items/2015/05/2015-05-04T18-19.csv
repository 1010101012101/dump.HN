9488260,comment,9488115,9488115,0,0,spotman,,,"Hi,<p>It&#x27;s not the worst idea, but here are some thoughts to consider:<p>* concurrency and locking<p>Databases are good at giving you a consistent view of data.  Some are better at it than others.  Depending on your application this may be more or less important to you.  However, how often would it be possible for your application to have multiple requests that come in.  How would you deal with if 2 requests write to the same file in s3?  Which one will have the accurate representation of your data?<p>To give an example, lets say (step1) request A comes in and pulls down this json stored in s3.  This request turns into a subsequent request (step2) to store the data in s3 (lets say a value in the JSON needs to change.)  Meanwhile, another request session is started, request B that also pulls down a copy of the data.  Lets say request B does this in-between step1 and step2.  So then on step 2 of request B - you are potentially overwriting data that you did not intend to.<p>* performance fluctuation<p>Having used S3 extensively, I can tell you that its performance varies.  What if your 400ms request goes through a 15 minute period where they are 4000ms requests.  Stranger things happen.  S3 is an extremely reliable system in terms of not losing your data, and generally working all the time, but performance varies.  With each request that takes longer than you think, resources in your application (file descriptors, cpu burn, etc) pile up.  If your application can sustain itself comfortably with these upper levels of latency you would be fine, but this may trigger downstream impatience with the users of your application, causing them to refresh data even more.<p>* querying and features<p>S3 is just a key value store at the end of the day.  Maybe that is enough for your application.  One day however, if you decide you want to know how many items in your database have a certain value, or how many were created on a certain date, you have no option but to really download the entire bucket iteratively from S3.<p>S3 doesn&#x27;t have a good way to even estimate the amount of data in it.  Clients that do this have to iterate over the contents of your bucket, and if one day the data grows to 100GB, this is a slow task.<p>In short, S3 tends to lend itself better to data that doesn&#x27;t have as much concurrency issues, or data that is mostly static.  However, if there is a will there is a way.  If it were me, I would be most worried about the lack of database-like features, and secondly worried about the concurrency issues, but it does depend on your application.<p>Cheers",1430765823

9488246,comment,9487903,9487903,0,0,JimmaDaRustla,,,"A few things:<p>1. A lithium ion battery charger is smart, it will not overcharge or harm your battery in any way keeping it charged.<p>2. In terms of discharging a lithium ion battery - they are not susceptible to memory like ni-cd and ni-mh batteries, so regular discharging is not required.<p>3. Apple and other companies will suggest discharging your lithium ion battery fully. The reason being that a complete discharge followed by a full recharge will update an internal counter which records the capacity of the battery. The capacity decreases over time, so your battery charge indicator will need this full discharge/recharge regularly to stay accurate. Not important for actual capacity you get out of your battery.<p>4. There is a recommendation that in order to get the MOST NUMBER OF DISCHARGE CYCLES out of a lithium ion battery, you should only discharge it to 50%. I put MOST NUMBER OF DISCHARGE CYCLES in bold because it is important to know that this is the most important factor in the life of your battery - you do not need to discharge the battery to 50% in order to get a longer life, but if you do need to discharge it, 50% discharge is optimal to avoid any damage by over-discharging. If you discharge your battery EVERY day because you charged it to full, you are going to severely decrease the lifespan.<p>5. (Edited in) Laptops and phones use a State of Charge estimation model to decide how full the battery is. Depending on the device, the manufacturer may suggest fully discharging and fully recharging the battery so that the estimation model understands the capacity of the battery and avoids overcharging: <a href=""http://chargedevs.com/features/the-challenges-of-battery-state-of-charge-measurements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chargedevs.com/features/the-challenges-of-battery-sta...</a><p>My recommendation: Don&#x27;t discharge when it is full. Only discharge when you need to. Charge it at 50% if possible to avoid over discharging. KEEP IT COOL - heat kills batteries lifespan as well.<p>Battery technology has changed a lot since I worked in the industry - they&#x27;re always advancing and changing. There are many resources to keep yourself well informed: <a href=""http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_li...</a><p>Edit: All applications and devices are different. My recommendation might not be the best - some have suggested avoiding keeping your battery at 100% constantly, whereas my suggestion assumes that the charger won&#x27;t harm the battery by overcharging. For example: battery is at 100% on the device, but in actuality it is sitting at 90% state of charge in the context of lithium ion technology.",1430765682

A cycle is one complete charge+discharge, with partial credit for partial discharges — so discharging to 50% counts as 0.5 cycles. [1]<p>This tells me that leaving your battery plugged in whenever possible is good, since it minimizes the number of cycles you&#x27;re putting on the battery. If you unplug the battery once it&#x27;s fully charged (and proceed to use it), you&#x27;re just subtracting cycles from the battery&#x27;s life.<p>On the other hand, apparently there&#x27;s a cost to letting the battery sit at 100% charge for too long. I don&#x27;t know how long &quot;too long is&quot;, but Apple&#x27;s battery site says this about long-term storage: &quot;Do not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge it to around 50%. If you store a device when its battery is fully discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.&quot; [2] Keep in mind this is specifically talking about long-term storage only.<p>Taken together, I interpret all this to mean that it&#x27;s best to leave the laptop plugged in at 100% whenever possible, provided that you&#x27;re <i>occasionally</i> taking it out and using it (so it&#x27;s not &quot;long-term storage&quot;).<p>That said, I&#x27;d love to see some quantitative benchmarks to confirm all this. ;)<p>References:<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_cycle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_cycle</a><p>2: <a href=""https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/</a>",1430765165

I spent some time working with the folks at National Semiconductor learning this, so I have several primary sources.<p>Disclaimer: my knowledge of the field is from ca 2010.<p>1) Lots of deep discharge cycles do negatively affect battery life. Try not to jump between 0% and 100% too much.<p>2) Li-ion batteries do not love being at 100% SOC (state of charge). As batteries become more dense, the membranes become thinner. High SOC equates to high chemical potential, which will break down membranes faster. As such, avoid leaving your battery at 100%. This wasn&#x27;t as much of a problem with older batteries with thicker membranes, but is becoming more and more an issue as we try to squeeze every ounce of density out of batteries.<p>3) Roughly 70% SOC is where a battery is happiest, but the whole range of ~30-80% is pretty happy for a li ion cell. Try to keep your battery at ~70% or so overnight, at 50% or so for long sleeps.<p>A good usage pattern: plug in and let charge to 90%, unplug and use for a couple of hours, plug back in at 50% or so, rinse and repeat.",1430765162

For this reason I&#x27;m skeptical that any amount of engineering would allow for an 800 mile EV within the next several decades, especially since electric motors are already extremely efficient.<p>According to Wikipedia[0] the efficiency of diesel engines can be up to 50%.  Using that number and similar reasoning to this[1] other comment a current Model S P85 stores energy equivalent to 14.7 L (or 3.9 US gallons) of diesel.  Your 2000 VW TDI has a fuel capacity of 54.9 liters or 14.5 gallons.  This means to go an equivalent distance the capacity of the Tesla Model S battery pack would have to increase by 3.75 times (to 273 kWh), either by increasing the energy density or by making the pack bigger.  Even though I am a big proponent of EVs I just don&#x27;t see that happening.<p>> Even within the urban core, where a 100 mile range is enough for a few days of commuting along with an emergency reserve, an 800 mile range is going to mean far less-frequent charges, just as it means far less frequent fill-ups for a combustion-powered car. That&#x27;s less strain on the owner&#x27;s wallet, and less strain on the electrical grid.<p>How does it matter how often you fill up?  Wouldn&#x27;t trying to fill a 800 mile battery all at once rather than trickle charging while the car is parked (which will likely be 20+ hours per day) be a much bigger strain on the grid?  Won&#x27;t you be storing the same amount of energy (and therefore paying the same total amount of money for that energy) whether you do it daily or biweekly?<p>Additionally, in your initial comment you wanted both an 800 mile range and a full recharge from empty in under 5 minutes.  Using the above estimate for required battery capacity that means you would have to charge it at a rate of 3.3 MW (yes, <i>megawatts</i>) or nearly 8800 amps at the 375 volt level the Model S battery pack operates at.  Short of superconductors I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even physically possible to transmit electricity at that amperage through wires without causing them to melt almost instantly.<p>> Not everyone can or wants to live in a densely-packed urban area, and for those who don&#x27;t, a vehicle with a long range is very practical.<p>> An extended driving range also makes longer road trips less expensive and more practical. A full day&#x27;s drive with fuel/charge to spare? Yes, please. And even if you think that such is a silly thing which no person should rightly desire from their personal transport when air travel (and airprort security theater) is available, consider another application: Trucks. [...]<p>Yes, for long trips, people who live in rural areas (where long-distance travel is more frequent) and for long-haul commercial transportation EVs as they are (and likely as they will be) won&#x27;t cut it.  There will always be gas and diesel vehicles for those applications.  However, for the average American who lives in an urban or suburban area and drives less than 100 miles a day EVs (with ranges well short of 800 miles) will probably largely replace ICE vehicles.  For them, an 800 mile range is not a requirement.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_efficiency#Diesel_engines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_efficiency#Diesel_engin...</a>

Empathy is a part of this, but so is just understanding how different people are and how they respond to things varies just as much.

Nobody cares if a transaction could theoretically cost $0.30 if right now someone pays those $10.00 for each and every of the 100,000 transaction on every single day. If the Bitcoin network at some point in the future processes 3 million transactions per day fine, but it does not right now and it honestly does not like this is going to happen anytime soon. The transaction volume is at best stable since more than one year and to me it actually looks more like it is slightly declining.<p>And even if you get your electricity for free there is still the other half of the costs, the largest part being hardware. It doesn&#x27;t really matter for me if it is $10 or $5 per transaction, it is not cheap. And even those theoretical $0.30 are still a lot. Real micro payments could be a killer application. Pay $0.05 or $0.10 to read a news article. If one hour of your time is worth $50 that is the equivalent 3.6 respectively 7.2 seconds of your time. Thinking a couple of seconds whether you should buy the article or not makes almost no sense at that price level. Just charge those few cents. But $0.30 per transaction is like a factor 100 to expensive for this.<p>And with expensive by nature I meant that the security of the system depends on that. The Bitcoin network will never be able to spend less money on running the system because that is what it is protected by, the money spend on hardware and electricity. You can&#x27;t even keep using your hardware for a long time because technological advances will make an attack cheaper and cheaper and therefore lower the security level your old hardware can provide. The Bitcoin network is doomed to throw money out of the window, hundreds of millions every year for processing not even enough transaction to make a Raspberry Pi sweat.

If you don&#x27;t have some actual real stake in the value that you&#x27;re creating, you are going to get jaded as the inevitable annoyances of being a startup take their toll.<p>Yeah, I worked at a young startup for almost 3 years, and one of the reasons I quit was because they would neither pay me market value nor give me equity. I made about 3/4 of what everyone told me an engineer of my experience in my location should be making. Hell, I didn&#x27;t even get health insurance, and the company made a point of hiring most new people as contractors, so they got around Obamacare&#x27;s 15-employee rule. The company was a year old when I was hired, so I was too new to be considered one of the founding members, but I was still one of the early employees, and I got to create a whole bunch of systems that were integral to the company&#x27;s operation.<p>Over time, I got more and more bitter and jaded, and it was affecting my work. I wrote the software platform, and I <i>was</i> our DevOps infrastructure, but all I could think about was that not only did I get paid like shit, but they didn&#x27;t value what I did enough to offer me equity. It upset me deeply that they would value me so little when I built huge parts of the company from the ground up, and I lost a lot of sleep over it. I already had a huge amount of stress in my life (this was all while I was transitioning from male to female, and I&#x27;ve struggled with depression for decades), and this made it all worse. By the time I quit, I had lost all motivation, and my boss was threatening to fire me because I hadn&#x27;t been coming up with enough new software to write (he had stopped giving me assignments weeks before that, mind you: I think he was looking for a reason to get rid of me).<p>There were other reasons I was bitter, too. For example, management treated my transition horribly, and they stood by and did nothing while I was subjected to humiliation for months by building management. It ended when I got the city involved, and I had to do 100% of the work on that myself (and, even then, our CEO almost sabotaged the city&#x27;s case, because he ran his mouth off on some things where he didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about). Another was one senior architect making godawful design decisions and being a manipulative, condescending, immature manchild when interacting with others. My boss gave him 100% free reign and treated him as an equal (this despite my boss being the Director of Software and a founding member) and dismissed any and every criticism about him just because the guy was an old friend of his for years. That drove one of my co-workers, who was one of my best friends at the company, to quit, and then my boss proceeded to slander him behind his back just because he had the gall to criticize my boss&#x27;s friend. In fact, I suspect that the reason he suddenly stopped giving me new assignments and then began threatening to fire me for not doing enough work was because I finally had enough and told him my complaints about his friend. It is entirely within his personality to go out of his way to railroad people who have offended him. Oh, and then there was the total lack of planning or release engineering, despite my best efforts to come up with written proposals on what to do...<p>I stayed as long as I did because a) my immediate co-workers were wonderful people I&#x27;m glad to call &quot;friend&quot;, and b) I had come to believe that I was worthless and that I deserved to work at a company that treated me like shit. [Edit: to be fair to them, I&#x27;ll add c) I actually enjoy doing this kind of work (platform/DevOps), and I really believe in their product. They make the kind of product that, if it takes off, will change a lot of people&#x27;s lives for the better, and I wanted to be part of it.]<p>Ultimately, I started looking for a new job, and I took the first offer I got, just to get out of there. Since the new year, I now work at a 20-year-old company, I get paid what I&#x27;m worth, I&#x27;m insured, and I&#x27;m pretty happy here. Still, even after being gone for a few months, the bitterness came back last month when I found out I owed an extra $400 on taxes because I was uninsured thanks to that company.

We certainly don&#x27;t have a magic formula that gets it right 100% of the time.  I can however say we are quite committed to this area and this project in particular.<p>Here are the things I think about most days:<p>In the case of Kubernetes, we are doing is a little different to anything we have done before. We have a commercial offering (Google Container Engine) based on this project that we ultimately hope the world to consider as a great way to run containers for money (yes, we hope to create a business around this).  The nice thing is we are a service provider so we just need to convince someone to use our compute services for us to benefit from an open source project we sponsor.  We aren&#x27;t really hiding our intentions here; we do containers well inside Google and have some whizz-bang container hosting infrastructure and services.  The problem is that people are not likely to use it unless there is a 100% open, fully compatible alternative available for off-Google use.  By way of background I was the product lead for Google Compute Engine (our infrastructure-as-a-service product) for several years.  The product is going really well now, but I learned the hard way that big customers like choices and no-one likes to be locked in.  This isn&#x27;t just us being Googley (though I have a personal predilection to openness);  this is a simple fact of the marketplace today.  We could not convince someone to bet on a disruptive technology if an open and credible alternative does not exist.<p>The second thing is that we see tremendous power in the open source community that we want to tap into, both for our cloud product line, and for our own internal use (it is no secret we use a lot of OSS internally).  Kubernetes has achieved an almost ridiculous velocity (check out our PR acceptance rates) because the community is supporting it.  It is a better product because we benefit not only from having a bunch of Google engineers working on it, but because we also get engineers from Red Hat, CoreOS and others who bring different perspective and capabilities.  We aren&#x27;t enterprise guys for example, but the Red Hat folks are -- the combined team is way better than the sum of the parts.  Our service (Google Container Engine) is stronger for it, and in the limit we expect to use Kubernetes to run a lot of our internal services too.<p>Cheers,

I&#x27;m not sure if this is referring to something about the `Option<T>` or something else.<p>By indexing, I meant as an alternative to references.. For example, if you had a Sprite type which held a &#x27;reference&#x27; to a Texture in your game&#x27;s Texture list.. as soon as you allocate a Sprite it must borrow a reference to a Texture, preventing any future mutation of the Textures list for the lifetime of the Sprite, which obviously is too restricting for most games.. so the alternative is to have the Sprite simply hold an index to an item in the array instead, but this basically comes with the same pitfalls as nilable refs (ie, if you accidentally change it, your program can crash due to bounds-checking errors.. or end up with visual glitches.. not sure which would be more annoying).<p>The other alternative is to use an Option<&Texture> instead. However, I&#x27;m not familiar enough with Rust to know of the restrictions here, or even if that&#x27;s possible (taking a look at the docs, it looks like it&#x27;s possible, but life-time vars come into play, which could complicate things).",1430764286

Fractal art is about all I can do[1].<p>Then I picked up a MIDI keyboard, a DAW (first LMMS, then Studio One) and had fun making music immediately. Haven&#x27;t been able to stop since.

I witness on a near-daily basis conversations turning into heated arguments simply because the protagonists fail to see beyond their own perspectives and convey their own inadequately. Quite often, it seems, the points brought forward by the &quot;opposing&quot; party are largely ignored, the arguments are no longer about who/what is right, but about who wins. You therefore end up with conversations where the two parties are in fact talking about the same thing, but are so caught up in their own narrative that instict (System 1) takes over. Alternatively, people may be talking about completely different things and fail to realize they&#x27;re doing so, effectively and unknowningly arguing in a vacuum, where loudness and displays of anger are more often than not the deciding factors. In both instances, this often results in disgruntled people and feelings being blown out of proportion. One only needs to look at political debates to see what I&#x27;m referring to.<p>On a lighter note, and hopefully providing more positive (anecdotal) examples than the article provides, signalling can be a very powerful tool too, even when mixed.

Maintaining the pending Interest state, together with the two-way Interest and Data exchange, enables NDN routers’ forwarding process to measure performance of different paths, quickly detect failures and retry alternative paths. In this paper we describe an initial design of NDN’s forwarding plane and evaluate its data delivery performance under adverse conditions.

I think this is a fair observation, but I also do wonder if you tried a different approach whether you would be able to learn. I hope that didn&#x27;t offend you, you certainly sound very hard working, and I wonder if I might be able to help if you were still interested in trying to learn an instrument.<p>It seems like you felt overwhelmed by all the various parts of making music. But since you are just starting and having trouble, I wonder if it would make more sense to try to isolate the different things until they become easy enough that you can do them together.<p>Please forgive me if you already tried this, as you didn&#x27;t mention whether you had a teacher and what music you were trying to play.<p>For example, if you had trouble with beats, you could try practicing the beats just by tapping your hand or singing or something else. I was ridiculously bad with rhythms (and still am?) so I have a lot of personal experience with this one.<p>Then, if you have trouble reading the notes, you can just write them down in a way that&#x27;s easier for you to read. There&#x27;s no shame in just writing down the note names! Alternatively, you could just try to memorize a single measure and practice that one measure. Again, I found myself doing this all the time, especially because on the piano you have two hands to read notes for. Of course, what might make even more sense is if you just picked easier music to play.<p>I think for fingering, the same advice kind of applies.. you can pick easier music, or just memorize small sections.<p>In a way I feel like you could use this same advice for programming as well. If you pick a super huge project and only gauge your progress for that whole project, you might get overwhelmed and feel like it&#x27;s taking too long, which stresses you out. Alternatively, if you break the project down into manageable chunks, you feel good about your progress!<p>At least this seems to have worked for me! I don&#x27;t know if this will help you at all and I apologize for being so stubborn but I really don&#x27;t believe you are unable to learn an instrument unless you have some learning disability.",1430763244

Well, this is subjective, of course, but I feel that it&#x27;s easier & faster to isolate everything now. I still have to add iptables rules (I also use AWS ports restrictions) and add SSH keys, but that&#x27;s all I have to do. Auto updates with scheduled reboots and safe rollback work out of the box, I have only few vector attacks in terms of services exposed to the public network. When I have everything in 1 data center, &quot;internal&quot; tools (etcd, fleet, confd, locksmithd) are open only in private network and just ports 22, 80 & 443 have to be exposed. Containers are also &quot;linked&quot; in private network, I can easily securely connect services/applications in containers running on different machines without much overhead.<p>Often the easiest attack vector is/are security vulnerabilities in applications exposed to the public network. Containers are great here, because when application is compromised, just 1 particular container is dead (and probably other containers running that app). I can just run docker kill app && docker rm app and the rest of my containers are (probably) ok. The problem is that attacker can gain access to data in etcd, since it&#x27;s not encrypted by default and has no per-user permission (but you can use HTTPS in etcd cluster, which is good), however as of now you can use something like crypt: <a href=""https://github.com/xordataexchange/crypt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/xordataexchange/crypt</a> to use gpg in etcd (with natural API).<p>Docker gives you root for everything in the container, which may not be the best option.

Reviewed thousands of lines of code. Programming is an aptitude that requires passion. The only programmers who are good are the ones who love to do it. If you don&#x27;t enjoy it, find another profession. Because all the things he said aren&#x27;t true are.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to be constantly learning then this is the wrong profession for you.

It's the result of both employer subsidized health insurance and bad regulation. I'm not against regulation. I'm just against stupid regulation and there's a ton of stupid regulation in the health industry today. Prime example: not being able to purchase health insurance out of state, which forces insurance corporations to setup shell companies in every state complicating the claims process and creating a ton of bureaucratic waste. On the employer provided bit, by having the employer negotiate the terms of the coverage, it removes the insured from the process. I, as an individual, have nearly no choice in the matter. I either go with the employer provided plan or I go with an ubsubsidized plan where there's nearly no competition in the marketplace, among other things (so rates are ridiculous).",1341100678

Do you learn better taking formal courses, having a supervisor oversee your project, having formal evaluation milestones (quals, proposal, thesis, defense)? Some people do, some don't.<p>I do think the process of doing research and thinking of your goal in terms of ""research contribution"" rather than ""product"" is valuable for many intelligent/curious people. I'm less sure (despite being an academic myself) that the formal academia route is the best way for everyone, though. Imo the most valuable part of academia is the interaction with a research community in an area that interests you: work on a project, collaborate with some people, submit papers to conferences, get reviewer feedback, revise things, present papers, chat at the conference banquet, get inspired with new problems or ideas, etc., etc. You don't strictly have to be an academic to do any of that, especially in CS, although a large proportion of people who do are.

4183194,comment,4182944,4183113,13,0,reitzensteinm,,,"It's different this time (and I cringe saying that), because we're rapidly approaching fundamental limits to scaling down silicon.<p>The concerns in the past have been mainly to do with lithography; eg, when the feature size of the silicon went below the wavelength of the light we were using, we had to make masks that utilized difference patterns. This is a mere manufacturing problem.<p>But now we're getting to fundamental limits. Even if we had the ability to place the atoms however we wanted them, there's an intrinsic limit. You can't make a transistor out of half an atom.<p>We already hit a wall with frequency; for the longest time, it looked like speeds would go up and up. It's not an apples to apples comparison, because the Pentium 4 had a long pipeline, but a 3.8ghz Prescott was released in 2005 - which is exactly the maximum turbo frequency of the 2011 Sandy Bridge 2600k I'm typing this now on. Ivy has it beaten by just 100mhz.<p>Now, that's not to say that computation will stop progressing. But it's not going to look like last year's CPU just smaller for much longer; some pretty fundamental changes are going to have to be made. Dynamically reconfiguring memristor circuits are what excites me, but it's just as likely to be something else instead.<p>As far as flash memory in particular goes, I'm no expert, but cell durability is falling substantially with each shrink (on average; Intel bucked the trend with their 25nm flash), and so the usable limit to feature size may come more quickly than with standard transistors.<p>But the industry has managed to push through walls that seemed just as intrinsic before, so I wouldn't bet my life savings on it.",1341100128

However, the fact that jQuery has ""free"" support for features like data binding is not enough justification to forgoe using a framework like backbonejs or emberjs. What about routing? In a large client-centric app, I'd argue that routing is as important as data binding.<p>There's no question that understanding the mechanics behind these frameworks will yield much better apps, even if you skip out and go barebones jQuery. But there's always going to be a tradeoff between writing all the boilerplate and structure yourself, rather than relying on a framework to lessen the burden.  With emberjs, you get immensely reduced boilerplate and some pretty sound opinions on structure. If you want to exchange writing more code for less of an opinion and more flexibility, then go with backbonejs.<p>Each of these frameworks bring key strengths to the table, having been written by amazing devs (like Yehuda Katz) with the additional benefit of ""community consensus"" to boost their usefulness. The article makes valid points, but keep in mind there's definitely more to this story.",1341098855

However, what they do can be distilled into much simpler terms. So after reading through the founder's Stanford thesis, and other online resources, here's my take on how the Lytro works.<p>Just like any camera, the Lytro has an optical lens that focuses to any distance. It has a relatively large aperture of f/2.0, which allows for a relatively shallow depth of field.<p>The only bit of hardware that's special or unique about a light-field camera is its 'micro-lens' array. The array is a repeated pattern of 3x3 matrices. Each of these 9 different microlenses focuses the light slightly closer or slightly farther away than the others. When you take a picture, the camera records data on the sensor that is then processed into exactly 9 pictures, each corresponding to a slightly different focal length (and therefore a slightly different band of the photo thats in focus).<p>The software then uses contrast detection to make a 20x20 sub-matrix indicating which of the nine images is in focus at the chosen point in the image. When you click on a point on a living image, it looks up that point and loads the image for which that point is most in focus.<p>The Lytro contains an 11 megapixel sensor. But because it takes 9 photos at once, the effective resolution of the final photograph is 1080x1080 pixels.<p>Its not a very complicated design: A microlens array that adjusts the focus on a small scale to produce 9 different images, each with a slightly different range of focus.<p>Thinking about rays of light isnt necessary to understand how it works.<p>Heres a video of the founder getting tripped up when a reporter pinpoints how his technology works (1:05)<p>http://video.forbes.com/fvn/sxsw-2012/eric-cheng-lytro-lightfield-camera",1341098712

If you're a salaried professional and have good health, it's more or less ok, with some weirdness around changing jobs (which is getting more common). It does become a <i>huge</i> problem still if you end up unlucky enough to have a major health problem earlyish in life, e.g. a congenital heart problem or cancer in remission. Then you in effect have to work for large companies to get into their group plans, be very careful about coverage gaps, and don't even think about doing freelance or a startup. It also produces weird moral dilemmas; for example, if you have a major preexisting condition and join a small company that offers health insurance, you may inadvertently be punching a big hole in their budget by massively worsening their employee risk pool from the perspective of the insurer (and the business isn't allowed to ask you about things like that before hiring).<p>The other big anger-relieving valve is Medicare, which removes a large proportion of major illnesses (anything with onset age 65+) from the problem space that private-sector health insurance has to address. If the elderly had to buy health insurance on the private market, or alternatively have their insurance covered via employer pension plans, I don't think the system would work at all, and there would be a lot more angry people (who vote at high rates).",1341098009

It has become a set-and-forget commodity for media consumers who do know about it (but who don't proselytize).

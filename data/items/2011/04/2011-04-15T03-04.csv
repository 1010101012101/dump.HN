One doesn't even advertise the fact that they use PHP because they want strong developers regardless of language.  Fact is, PHP is pretty darn simple to pick up, not much harder to do things correctly, and has a <i>lot</i> of third party/opensource support.  Is it cool?  No, but when it comes to language wars, this pretty much sums up my feelings:<p><a href=""http://programming-motherfucker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programming-motherfucker.com/</a><p>Personally, there was a startup about 6 years ago where I wanted to use Python.  The IT guy and I got into a discussion about PHP vs. Python.  He was more comfortable in securing PHP apps.  I was enamored with Python, since I was writing a bunch of stuff with it.  After exploring mod-python vs. mod-php, mod-python had bugs and wasn't nearly as mature, so we went with PHP.  The language didn't matter, it was about getting things done.<p>There are lots of ""cool"" languages out there, a good dev will run circles around a mediocre dev who focuses on things that are ""cool"".",1302839736

Back in the day we used to use MySQL as a shared session storage for load balanced web servers - this is obviously something from the past and since then we moved it to Memcached. Once we started implementing Mongo, it seemed to make perfect sense to just use Mongo instead of Memcached to store that information - but to my surprise (and I love Mongo), Memcache outperformed Mongo as far as overhead and latency goes for managing the sessions.

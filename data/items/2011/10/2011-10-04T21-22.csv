Along with flexibility, the other major benefit of a physical storyboard is that it fosters communication and collaboration by forcing people to get up from their desks and talk face to face. Also in standup meetings it is invaluable to be able to stand around the board and talk about what it is showing you regarding blockages and flow, and immediately do something about it. So ideally you'd project the board up on a big screen or a big TV or something. Then if anyone has an ipad or iphone handy, you can update the board on the fly.",1317765535

3073100,comment,3071647,3072906,3,0,DrJokepu,,,"That's not the point, the question is about understanding fundamental, abstract computer science concepts and being able to craft simple algorithms. Even if we don't manipulate these data structures directly these days in code, there are ""real world"" concepts that are very similar to these fundamental data structures such as HTTP redirection chains, various stages of a workflow and so forth. It is due to the very nature of computers that a good developer has to be able to find abstractions in real world patterns and solve problems using these abstract ideas. A linked list (or a binary tree) is a very simple abstract idea and it's a good device for measuring the candidate's skill at solving abstract problems.<p>Additionally, my view and experience is that unless we're trying to hire a specialist in a niche, domain knowledge (in this case, .NET) is considerably less important than general programming skills and abilities; a good developer with limited .NET skills would still write excellent .NET code, a developer who's very familiar with the .NET Framework but who's poor programming skills would be a liability for the company.",1317765483

They don't just blindly quit their education just for the sake of starting something. Many times it was due to a really good compelling reason such as Angel/VC funding was approved, taking a lot of their time, huge sudden interest, exponential customer acquisition, etc. Also, for every 1 successful person you hear that quit their college, there are another 100 others who have failed.<p>Anyway, who am I to tell you what to do. Again, like I said at the start, kudos for you for actually even doing something which puts you ahead of many others who are still at the ""thinking stage"".

In the new design something like this is missing.<p>2. The ordered list of instructions how to use the service is actually good. It's linearly ordered and concise. I like it.<p>3. There is a ""Helpful Video""? That's fantastic!<p>In the new design there is a huge background image, the mail box. On my screen I see only the upper part of the picture, the wooden part visible in the screenshot is clipped - scrolling does not help, the image is fixed.<p>In the old design there is no background image, so the text links to the privacy policy and terms of service are better to find. Text or text links on a background image are generally not the best idea, if readability is intended. Maybe you will even have users with a mobile device that can only display some grey scale colors, then setting a sufficiently high contrast between text and background is a good idea.<p>On the other hand, there is now a logo for the service in the new design. That's an excellent idea, since it was missing in the old design. Pick a logo you are happy with and never change it.<p>The design of the ""terms of service"" page in the new layout is not so bad, maybe you could use parts of this design on the front page as well, plus the now missing elements from the old design?

The CPU is going to go into low-power states quite frequently while you're using these I/O bound applications you describe, and the sooner it can, the better.<p>I don't think what I'm saying is controversial in the mobile industry.  For example, here's an old article that has a quote about the effects of Intel's Quick Start technology from back in the year 2000 that captures what I'm saying:<p><a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/2782/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/2782/2</a><p><i>""Intel has figured out that it is best to use full CPU power for a split second to finish a task and then put the CPU to idle as this conserves battery life the best. Although one may suspect that when running complex operations the CPU would not have time to go idle, this is not the case. To illustrate this point, Intel used an example of DVD playback. Very stressful on the system as a whole, Intel's quick start technology allows the CPU to ""hurry up"" and perform the DVD decoding operations and then go idle until the frame is displayed to screen and the next scene needs to be calculated. This saves battery life because, although the system may require 3 watts or so to ""hurry up"", the power consumption goes down near .25 watts when idle. By averaging these two numbers, one can quickly see how quick start can extend battery life.""</i>",1317763276

Seriously, they have no problem defining piracy as wrong, but make no mention of what would actually be required in terms of surveillance and policing for that moral convention to be reliably maintained.<p>Beyond his insensitivity to reality, Mr. Flores appears to have no understanding that copyrights are not rights at all. There's noting inalienable about them. To the contrary, they are - very explicitly - privileges. They are given to very limited numbers of people for (theoretically) limited times. For a sovereign society to continue giving out these privileges, it's going to expect something in return. If that includes an obscenely invasive and overbearing police apparatus that has the power and freedom to monitor every bit of data every person exchanges it's an easy deal to reject.<p>In spite of all his rage (or perhaps because of it) Mr. Flores has never stopped to consider that the crime of theft pertains chiefly to physical property and tangible goods. This has been true for thousands of years, meaning that there is now a very well established body of law relating to misappropriation of physical goods - one that extends, in various forms, worldwide. And there is no popular pressure to change this convention. Nor is there any sense that the policing required to maintain this convention constitutes a serious threat to human rights. Indeed, the creation of property rights, and their attachment to tangible goods seems to be a fundamental feature of societies that advance human rights, and a culture of autonomy.<p>Extending the concept of property rights and theft to intangible goods is a different matter entirely. A relatively recent idea, it was an experiment that worked reasonably well as long as intangible goods remained wedded to some physical wrapper which could be safely governed by uncontroversial property laws. Now that the wrappers have become obsolete, the ability to allow the safe and ethical extension of property rights into the sphere of the intangible has collapsed. Only reckless, short-sighted, or truly sinister players (the Maximalists) continue to press in this direction.<p>Smarter - and yes, more ethical - people properly dismiss copyright as an appropriate mechanism for governing the conduct of private individuals. That means they don't get involved in business that can only work if the Maximalists get their way. While copyright certainly retains substantial  value as a tool for regulating the conduct of incorporated entities (which are, themselves, intangible entities), it is 100% incompatible with a culture of individual autonomy in the present day.<p>The world probably doesn't need (yet another) shitty app. What it does need are people who can imagine and build businesses that limit reliance on copyright to engagements with incorporated entities, while treating individual humans with healthy respect for their political freedom, privacy, and autonomy. Indeed, entrepreneurs should focus on products and services that INCREASE these qualities, not misguided attempts to undermine them for the sake of a fast buck with no concern given to the consequences.",1317763111

It's not hard to imagine they have ~one order or magnitude competitive advantage over companies doing similar work in C++ (reminding me of PGs essay about choosing lisp for viaweb) The performance crunch for their Python apps is really in the underlying C or C++ libraries -- which are open-sourced so they don't have to maintain it all themselves.<p>One thing to note about KW and ET is that they build libraries and invest in leveraging tools to improve productivity (KW: CMake, CDash, etc. ET: Traits, Chaco, etc.)<p>One approach to try to emulate KW/ET: get an SBIR or build a small team around grant subcontracts.

The impulse to belittle them in light of an impressive achievement baffles me.<p>Android and Siri. Android does well, yes, but Google's financial success has not yet been shown to be correlated with Android shipments (look at the stock performance over the last two years for evidence). In some interesting instances competitors (Baidu and Amazon) have gutted Android to be used against them. Every query that is performed on Siri is routed to services that are NOT search, which is where Google makes its money. Why Google would invest money in implementing mobile services that route computing away from the web is beyond me. It isn't in their interest. Joe Hewitt made this observation before too. So while yes, Google might be technically capable of adding voice assistant, it isn't clear how that leads to increased profits for them. Feature parity is the wrong way to think about the Apple Google relationship.",1317762458

Before I ditched my iPhone 3G for an Atrix, the device was barely usable. It didn't just stutter, it would <i>hang</i> for upwards of a minute when opening certain apps (maps, I'm looking at you), and it's not like the device was defective as I've used others and had an identical experience.<p>Now, maybe the 4G offers a smoother experience than Android (no GC + hardware acceleration?), I don't know, but the 3G experience was sure as hell nothing to write home about. I can say, however, that my Atrix is noticeably more responsive after switching from Motorola's firmware to Cynanogen Mod, but -- again -- I don't know how it compares to a 4G.",1317762219

If you throw 1,000 threads at the problem with a 2MB stack each, that's 2GB of DRAM you've thrown away (instead of 20MB * ncores per Node process) -- DRAM that could be caching filesystem data, for example, which could have a huge impact on overall performance.<p>With Node, the DRAM and CPU used scales with the number of cores and actual workload.  With a thread pool, the DRAM used scales at least with the number of concurrent requests you want to be able to handle, which is often much larger than you can handle simultaneously (because many of them will be blocked much of the time).<p>Assuming you're not willing to reserve all that memory up front, the algorithm for managing the pool size also has to be able to scale quickly up and down (with low latency, that is) without thrashing.",1317762211

3072897,comment,3072157,3072861,3,0,dave1619,,,"I agree it's a big ""IF"".  IF Siri works as advertised, then it really could be revolutionary.  I remember being pumped up by Google's demo of voice recognition, only to try it out and find it novel and cool but not dependable and accurate enough to use in all my real-life situations.  And it's difficult to correct errors, or clarify requests in a conversation manner like Siri.<p>Another reason to hope is that Siri had 19 people when Apple acquired it and most of them are still at Apple.  I would imagine that Apple scaled their team significantly.  Who knows?  Maybe 100 engineers working on it, since it's a cornerstone of the next generation of mobile devices (and probably coming to desktop in the near future too).  But Google doesn't seem to have the same priority on natural language processing as Apple does cause more than 50% of Apple's revenue comes from the iPhone.  How many engineers at Google are working on voice recognition and natural language processing?  Maybe somebody here will know.  Maybe max 10 engineers?<p>Apple also will be forced to scale Siri across multiple languages very quickly, especially if it works well.  Currently they have English, French and German.  But tons of people will want it, so that motivates Apple to innovate even more.<p>I guess we'll see very soon how good Siri on the iPhone 4s really is.",1317762072

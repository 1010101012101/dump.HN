In short, if every car was sold from the same dealership, each city/county would get the same sales tax as it would with a dealer in every city/county.<p>One side effect of this is that you can't get a discount on car sales tax by buying in a low-tax area if you live in a high-tax area like you can with most other purchases, such as car parts, books, computers.  (Sales tax varies by city and county in CA.)",1247284737

It was one of my favourite things of life.<p>(A ""style case"" is one where the facts or logical reasoning behind an argument are secondary to how funny and entertaining your arguments and persuasive efforts are.)<p>According to what we concluded in that round, we <i>need</i> to start destroying tropical cyclones, and any other of Mother Nature's ""attacks"" on us, in order to better condition her and bend her to our will. It's Psychology 101, folks.<p>Apparently the NOAA disagrees. If this were the McCarthy era, I'd call them communists and be done with it.",1247284625

It's also fairly easy to detect known non-text types, as producers are kind enough to pick novel values for the first few words (""man 4 magic"").<p>It doesn't really even have to sniff at all to get the obvious cases -- if it's unhandled and in text/, display it! (though that still wouldn't handle inanities like application/x-ruby in Ubuntu's mime.types, or the total retardation that is FF's handling of application/json)",1247283956

698777,comment,697856,697856,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"An operating system cannot be virus free. Because of the human error. Even if we made the 100% perfect virus checker, the human part of the equation will always find a way to give out their password or admin privileges to a phishing site or many other scenarios.<p>That said, there are tools an OS can do to mitigate the damage that viruses can do. So while there will always be a smarter virus, there can always be a way to only let the smart virus get to something that it could have gotten to no matter what.<p>Its like Google Chrome. Google Chrome itself is not perfect, has MANY (those we know of, those we don't) security flaws, BUT getting out of the sandbox that Google Chrome provides is a very difficult problem. The basic idea is really to let viruses happen. Just let them get made. There will always be a security hole to exploit. As long as the damage the virus can do is very limited and moot it won't matter.<p>That might be what google is doing. Maybe they are just making a super-glorified browser-based system in which google chrome's sandbox protects the user while googles native client allows all sort of cool programs to run and in the end you are still on windows, but the security risk is absolutely minimal.",1247283098

698773,comment,698759,698765,0,0,bcl,,,"You should submit patches and contact the vendors. But history has shown that many vendors will, in general, ignore you until a demonstrated exploit is available. They still believe that security by obscurity is a valid way to protect their customers.<p>I should say that I am not a fan of 0-day exploit releases. You should at least try to convince the vendor to do the right thing. But failing that, a full disclosure release is the only way to force them to act.<p>And by full disclosure I do mean a detailed description of the problem, with code demonstrating the exploit.",1247281913

169333,comment,169060,169060,0,0,wheels,,,"Here's the thing -- as has been pointed out here many times, investors are conservative.  Once a meme catches on everybody rides that wave for a while hoping for the point where there's some consolidation and those startups get snatched up.<p>Doing really cool stuff is riskier.  Scarier.  There are no rules laid down yet for what sort of value you're generating.<p>That said, there are hard algorithms more places than you expect.  When trying to scale something that looks simple on the surface, problems often become complex enough to be interesting.",1208782465

Watch as they work a room.  A relatively cheap donation will get you invited.  Consider it a training fee.  You'll learn more about power and interpersonal relationships in a night than a month of sitting by yourself at the bar.<p>btw - I second that this is a skill that does not come from books.

Make it a project to encourage each other; that is, if I don't muster up the courage to meet someone and start a conversation, then <i>you</i> get a demerit.  It's almost uncanny how we will find a way to succeed given a limited scope, easily defined problem.<p>Once you get into the swing of things, instinct takes over and you'll be fine.  You probably have something interesting to discuss with almost everyone else out there.  The trick is finding it.<p>I don't buy into the philosphy of learning about popular culture, sports, or current events just to have something to talk about.  Stick with what turns you on; you can be yourself (who else would you be?), and the same thing probably turns someone else on, too.<p>(Aside: A drink or two couldn't hurt.  That's what it's there for.)",1208782082

Commodore was beating themselves too, with a dearth of marketing and slow development. I only saw one TV ad.

You become peaceful and confident in everyday interactions.<p>Singing and playing guitar helps too, it makes you wanted and welcome, which you want to be.<p>A non-trivial fact for me was that a lot of conversations aren't about information; talking is a game, played for fun.

Figure out something you like and go spend some time doing it.  Oddly enough, the nerds you do meet in other contexts tend to be interesting and well connected.  (In Berlin for instance, there's a large overlap between the open source / founders social scenes and the electronic music scenes.

I think they're overstaffed when they hire people and they're bored, and I think that's been the case at Google for quite some time now.\n",1192766165

The 23-year-old CEO said,""We have thought about developing a good team rather than hiring a CEO with experience in this space, and I'm not convinced that exists. Instead we are focused on building a strong team."" ...""</i> ~ <a href=""http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=6643"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=6643</a><p>Now I think I know why (after doing a bit of reading). Facebook for all its sophistication does not have much to offer beyond the connectivity. Hence the reason to open up to external developers. One problem with that is you'll get a couple of killer useful applications but a lot of pretty ordinary ones. ~ <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2168872/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2168872/</a><p>So while Facebook has had extraordinary growth for it to continue as it's investors (or soon to be investors) expect it needs a continuous supply of  ""Visicalc"", ""Word"" or Killer Apps to sustain and continue growth. Hence the need to develop a bigger team.  ",1192765644

70142,comment,70073,70130,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That's not exactly true. They remain involved with you indefinitely. They have a vested interest in your success, it would be silly of them not to. <p>Their strategy (lot of small investments) does take depend on economies of scale, so it's not as hands on as Sequoias, which depends a few big investments. They obviously won't spend as much time with you as a VC would because of that, but the time they do spend is proportionately more valuable.<p>You give up a small % of the company, and it's a lot more than a presentation. There are also advice, contacts, and credibility.",1192765469

When cars were invented, there must've been people who said ""I think I'll stick to horses until they work out the kinks in those car things"". Those people probably didn't go on to found IBM or RCA. :-)<p>I generally strive to embrace new things and new ways of doing things. As long as I believe they're practical. For instance, full OS upgrade over the internet -- brilliant. Ubuntu is the first to offer this to my knowledge. On the other hand, web apps.. I don't see that as being very practical any time soon.<p>There will certainly be bugs and there's a certain amount of risk in doing an internet upgrade, but this is not major risk. Yet embracing the way of the future early will get you a head start, and I think it's an important mindset to have.",1192764217

Long term projects belong in the hands of those that are willing to go in for the long haul.<p>I am not too disappointed that our application was rejected on those grounds.

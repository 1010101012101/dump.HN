It's really very stupid.<p>On the point of teaching however I am a bit more optimistic ... in Sweden at least. I am fairly impressed with most of my students. They are for the most part curious, hard working and smart. So far the elements that have tried to dumb everything down have failed. Although they do keep trying...<p>In the long run education is probably in trouble. \n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccYoVnBc_fk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccYoVnBc_fk</a><p>\n",1194735518

78255,comment,78150,78254,0,0,henning,,,"Here's the abstract:<p>Upper-body fat has negative effects and lower-body fat has positive effects on the supply of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are essential for neurodevelopment. Thus, waist-hip ratio (WHR), a useful proxy for the ratio of upper-body fat to lower-body fat, should predict cognitive ability in women and their offspring. Moreover, because teenage mothers and their children compete for these resources, their cognitive development should be compromised, but less so for mothers with lower WHRs. These predictions are supported by data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Controlling for other correlates of cognitive ability, women with lower WHRs and their children have significantly higher cognitive test scores, and teenage mothers with lower WHRs and their children are protected from cognitive decrements associated with teen births. These findings support the idea that WHR reflects the availability of neurodevelopmental resources and thus offer a new explanation for men's preference for low WHR.",1194735413

I also like the posts where people talk about specific problems their start-ups are  facing.<p>But I really don't want to hear discussions of politics and religion, especially when they degrade into flame wars. I think there are plenty of other places on the web that people can do that if they are interested. And trust me I have done my fair share.

78242,comment,78150,78150,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Humans are born as physiological fetuses to allow further growth of the skull. There is a natural limit to how early a child can be born, and therefore a natural limit on the size of heads. Human females have adapted wide hips to account mainly for the size of the brain, but there is a practical limit to that as well. The cesarean section will perhaps allow further increase in human intelligence.<p>If the hip-fat theory is correct, then other bodily fats should have a similar effect. I am guessing I could find data that suggests large-assed females actually have children with lower IQs, though I doubt I could get a grant for that.",1194732088

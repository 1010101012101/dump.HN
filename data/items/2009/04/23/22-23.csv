It sounds cool to have a DVR and for $5 a month the cable company makes it easy. The cable company DVR experience is painful at best. Most commonly it is frustrating and difficult to use, not including the trust that a DVR must earn before you let it time shift your favorite shows. Using Tivo for the past 4+ years I shudder when I use a cable company DVR.",1240527245

Maybe in Fresno, but in Austin, many of the homeless you see out on the streets are alcoholics or trying to make a living without working.  One woman I knew who worked with the homeless said that most of them are trying to avoid responsibility, and a guy I know who used to give out sack lunches to the homeless near campus eventually stopped because after talking to them he realized they weren't just unlucky, they'd chosen that lifestyle.  I assume that those who don't want to be homeless have a tendency to go to the ARCH, which has training programs and long-term residency.",1240526763

We never, <i>ever</i> watch live TV under normal circumstances (barring election nights, 9/11, and so on), and the only time ads aren't skipped is when there is nobody in the room to skip them (or watch them).

There are hundreds of food chains in the US, with widely varying recipes, serving sizes, and nutritional contents.  Even being familiar with the subject area, I generally won't be able to recognize a food.

You cannot estimate portion size on a photo, not having anything to compare with.

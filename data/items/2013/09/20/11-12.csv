It is useless information unless the kid loves that kind of stuff.<p>* Focus should not be on memorizing anything, unless they are a building block of something which they will understand later, and better, with the memorization. May be the Spanish language verb forms are one of those, I&#x27;m not sure. From my experience I know a lot of knowledge do fall in this category, e.g. trigonometric manipulations, algebra of integration/differentiation, etc.<p>* Kids of that age, 13, have a fairly developed brain to decide which subjects they like, and which they are not interested in. They should be allowed to choose not to study Earth Sciences in favor of Physics, if they want to. Or to study Linguistics in favor of Maths (I assume they already know a basic level of mathematics to get by), if they want to.<p>I wonder how these kids gonna grow up, will the relentless homework on often useless subjects, create the discipline in them that is their most probable intention? Will this discipline help them to do better in life, as opposed to the Captain Kirk types?",1379678385

6417097,comment,6412708,6415674,3,0,flumbaps,,,"Very often people have their perceptions distorted by their emotions. When someone calls someone a &quot;hater&quot; they are saying that the &quot;hater&quot; is a person who lets their perceptions get distorted by hate, or some other source of negativity that is being channeled into hatefulness.<p>Usually that accusation is justified. Even if the complaint itself is reasonable, in most cases, the act of complaining is not. For example, if you see someone who is overweight, the sentence &quot;you are fat&quot; is arguably objectively correct. However, the act of saying that sentence out loud reveals something about the speaker. The weight level of a stranger is not their business. They do not convey any new information. It seems likely that the motivation for making such a statement is some desire to hurt the stranger. Desiring to hurt strangers is a bad thing, and is pretty much the definition of &quot;hater&quot;. A &quot;hater&quot; is someone who lets their own personal emotional problems colour their perspective of the world, generally seeing other people in a negative light, and generally thinking it is okay to hurt strangers for no reason. The world is chock full of people like that and if you can&#x27;t see that, it&#x27;s probably because your perspective is similarly skewed.<p>To clear up a few things, context is important. It shouldn&#x27;t be socially acceptable to publicly throw vitriol at strangers who are deemed attention seekers. (If you don&#x27;t like attention seekers, don&#x27;t give them attention. Nothing more is reasonable.) On the other hand, someone singing badly outside your apartment clearly directly affects you. People who campaign against fox hunting are personally invested in the issue. Whether or not it&#x27;s reasonable for them to get upset about it is a matter of opinion - and is closely related to whether or not their views are deemed reasonable. The anti-fox hunting movement is generally seen as legitimate, even by people who disagree with them. However, not everything that people campaign on is regarded as reasonable, take the Westboro Baptist Church for example.<p>Being turned into a hipster meme is pretty harsh, whatever you say. Even the hardiest of Internet tough guys break down under torrents of social media abuse. There are countless examples of Reddit mob justice singling people out and breaking them down. It&#x27;s obviously a deeply unpleasant experience, and unless you&#x27;ve been through it, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re in a position to make light of it.<p>Lastly, I just want to say I find it hard to understand why you don&#x27;t have any concept or understanding of what bullying is. The most likely explanation is that you are prone to negativity and you&#x27;re being self indulgent about it. So, given your commitment to absorbing other people&#x27;s perspectives, why don&#x27;t you take on board mine? I think you&#x27;re probably an overly negative person. If you see the majority of people around you negatively, then you have unrealistic standards (by definition). Unrealistic standards will make you unhappy, because you will be perpetually disappointed and full of complaints. It&#x27;s better to care less about the faults of others and enjoy their good points. In fact, if you want to live a happy life, then you need to have tougher standards on yourself than you do on others. That might sound counter intuitive, but it&#x27;s pretty obvious that most people live pretty unhappy lives. If you want to live a happy life then you need to do better than them - and you can&#x27;t get upset at their failings, because that&#x27;ll make you unhappy.",1379677296

In recent times, this has snowballed into a huge controversy and caused some other laws being passed to ensure care first.<p>Now here&#x27;s the issue - this is still a gray area. Let&#x27;s say you are a newly minted doctor working in the hospital and a patient comes in with several injuries and who tells you that there is a gang incident in a pub and likely many people are injured. What is the <i>mandated process</i> - do you have to make a police report first, or do you provide medical care first ? Doing either can result in the doctor being blamed for something or other.<p>Or is there a dedicated &quot;liason&quot; whose job is to do the reporting and leave the care to the doctors.

Even with all this gear your proposing which would definitely weigh something significant (because ounces are significant in bike weight, and weight is the single most important performance metric for a bike), the physical action of the riders body is going to be the dominant effect of anything that happens.<p>Furthermore, a bike is a lot more agile than a big hunk of steel plodding in a straight line.  You can shoot through a tiny gap that a computer would not be able to detect you were aiming for.  There is no way to have the necessary safety margin without being totally unusable in practice.",1379675555

Instead of allowing his daughter to watch episodes of Portlandia on her computer all afternoon, he could consider a rule suggesting homework gets completed before electronic entertainment; that&#x27;s our rule this year (for the first time) and it&#x27;s working better than I thought it would. Another rule we have: complete or not, homework is done at 9:30PM.\n</code></pre>\nThe parent doesn&#x27;t say, but its entirely possible that his daughter has non-academic hobbies. Perhaps she competes in a sport, dances or feeds the homeless. In-fact, wouldn&#x27;t it be more negligent to deny her the opportunity to take part in those non-academic activities?",1379675536

Gabriel) in 1981/82. This group was supported by various Common Lisp implementors - around 30 people. Steele wrote the book on Common Lisp the Language and published it in 1984.<p>The ANSI Committee to expand and clean-up the language was set up years later.<p>> incorporate several popular implementations of Lisp that each had several decades worth of of cruft<p>That&#x27;s also nonsense. Common Lisp is mostly based on a single language: Lisp Machine Lisp (aka Zetalisp), which is an extended version of Maclisp. Groups developing other successors to Maclisp joined: NIL, Spice Lisp and S1 Lisp. Lots of things in Zetalisp were new in Lisp and it took quite some time to get it into Common Lisp, which itself also brought new things into Lisp (like type annotations, sequences, ...).<p>So Common Lisp is directly based on Lisp Machine Lisp, which only was a few years old. NIL, S1 Lisp and Spice Lisp were brand new and morphed into Common Lisp. Spice Lisp was morphed into CMU Common Lisp, which forked the now popular SBCL.<p>The style to use keyword arguments in parameter lists was brand new in Lisp. It appeared in Lisp Machine Lisp just a few years before. LML did get it from an obscure Lisp dialect called MDL (&#x27;Muddle&#x27;).<p>> Lisp was big enough business at the time that having several mutually incompatible versions of Lisp was making knowledge sharing and business difficult.<p>Lisp was emerging as an implementation/research language for the military. DARPA called for a Lisp standard, because they got several Lisp applications and each had its own version of Lisp...",1450713545

What evidence (if any) would cause you to believe it to be true?<p><i>Even if that were true, I see no claim that they cannot change, so I don&#x27;t see why the cause matters.</i><p>The cause matters because it affects potential solutions. If the cause of a mobility difference between the US and Sweden is economic, then the fix is probably adopting the Swedish economic system (e.g., privatizing education and adopting their sane corporate tax system). If the cause is genetic then the solution would be adopting Swedish genetics by removing from the gene pool anyone of non-Nordic descent. If the cause were close social then the solution would be preventing poor people from transmitting their harmful values and behaviors to their children.<p>Hypothetically, suppose I could provide adequate evidence (as per my prior question) that Ashkenazi Jews have superior intelligence and other hereditary advantages that cause them to occupy disproportionate chunks of the top rungs of society (thereby lowering mobility). Asift and myself would oppose changing this since the only solutions are violent. If one doesn&#x27;t eliminate violence as a possible solution, what new avenues open up for us to solve this &quot;Jewish problem&quot;?",1450713454

In many countries jobs such as teaching and nursing, which did not require a degree 30 years ago, are now reserved for graduates. When just a small elite went to university, plenty of decent jobs were available to those with only secondary schooling. That is no longer true.<p>This is the most interesting part of the education puzzle to me. There is quite clearly an oversupply of people with degrees, both undergraduate and post-graduate, but the harsh reality is that you still <i>need</i> one due to credentialism, the shrinking number of &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; problems, and, paradoxically, the increased supply of people with degrees.<p>One solution from a hiring perspective is a DaaS (Degree as a Service) model such as HourlyNerd [1] or Gigster (YC15) [2] where you can hire well-pedigreed business and CS graduates as micro consultants or coders.<p>But in the future the biggest change I expect to see is one in the hiring attitude. As more and more future managers go through college, I expect many to become more and more skeptical of the aptitude and capabilities of the average graduate. I expect brand names to decrease in value as businesses and decision makers increase prioritization on demonstrated ability (Github, portfolio of work) and cost to hire, which will generally be lower for less well-branded schools and alternative methods of education, such as apprenticeships and online education.<p>That&#x27;s just my gut feeling from personal observations. There&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;m 100% wrong and getting a branded education will be more important than ever due to the high number of candidates w/ degrees, and the increasing importance of connections and network. That seems to be they way SV is moving these days.<p>[1] <a href=""https://hourlynerd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hourlynerd.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/uber-for-developers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/uber-for-developers/</a>",1450712478

This is supposedly an unintended side-effect of some cornea replacement surgery[1].<p>UV may have the potential to be damaging, but plenty of animals see UV-A safely - for example, bees[2] and mantis shrimp[3] can perceive UV to 300nm. Some birds (whose eyes are much more like ours, of course) can also perceive UV[4][5].<p>If we wanted some ready-made genes, I vote for borrowing from the European starling, which has receptors that sit in our enormous gap between blue/violet and green as well as UV-A [6].<p>Near infrared could be very useful, because (in combination with red, green, etc.) it can be used to easily distinguish vegetation, and it scatters less in the atmosphere, so it could allow clear vision at much farther distances. Most materials that are transparent to red/green/blue are also transparent to NIR, so as far as I know, the rest of the eye shouldn&#x27;t need to be modified.<p>Most people can apparently see a little bit into the NIR if they wear NIR-bandpass goggles, but it&#x27;s extremely dim and doesn&#x27;t have a perceived colour that&#x27;s distinct from the rest of the visible spectrum, so that&#x27;s not really what the GP is suggesting. They&#x27;re suggesting wiring up a true NIR-specific receptor in the eye which would provide a fourth, fifth, or sixth primary colour (in addition to red, green, blue, and optionally the in-between-red-and-green that tetrachromats see as well as a hypothetical UV-A receptor).<p>I can&#x27;t find a cite at the moment, but some birds have NIR patterning on their feathers (I have photographed this myself at a zoo), and the last time I looked into it, there was some speculation that tropical birds in particular had some NIR sensitivity (in addition to UV-A) and had evolved spectrally-complex colouration as a result.<p>Thermal infrared is a much longer wavelength, and I&#x27;m not aware of a good material for lenses/eyes that is transparent to both. It&#x27;s possible to have an uncooled sensor that detects it, but I agree that it&#x27;s a much larger leap than UV-A or NIR.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.itworld.com/article/2732596/consumer-tech-science/real-world-superpowers--eye-surgery-lets-some-see-well-into-the-ultraviolet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itworld.com/article/2732596/consumer-tech-science...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.agriculture.purdue.edu/agcomm/newscolumns/archives/OSL/2012/June/120614OSL.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.agriculture.purdue.edu/agcomm/newscolumns/archiv...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/mantis-shrimp-see-things-differently-literally"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/mantis-shrimp-s...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/26994-how-birds-uv-vision.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescience.com/26994-how-birds-uv-vision.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/17B.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/17B.html</a>",1450712016

First, not quite halfway down in the article,<p>&quot;What happened in America then happened in Europe and Japan in the 1960s and 1970s, in South Korea in the 1980s, and is now happening the world over. Student numbers are growing faster than global GDP. So hungry is the world for higher education that enrolment is growing faster than purchases of that ultimate consumer good, the car (see chart 1). The global tertiary enrolment ratio—the proportion of the respective age cohort enrolled in university—increased from 14% to 32% in the two decades to 2012; the number of countries with an enrolment ratio of more than half went up from five to 54 over the period. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only part of the world where “massification” is not much in evidence yet.&quot;<p>So undergraduate higher education enrollment is becoming commonplace all over the world. That, in turn, means that young people possessing an undergraduate degree is now more and more commonplace, so the job market has begun regarding postgraduate degrees more and more.<p>From farther along in the article,<p>&quot;As first degrees become standard, more people are getting postgraduate qualifications to stand out from the crowd. In both America and Britain, 14% of the adult workforce have a postgraduate degree; and despite the increase in supply, the postgraduate premium has increased in both America and Britain, especially since 2000. There was a time, points out Stephen Machin, professor of economics at University College London, when a postgraduate degree depressed wages; but that was when maths PhDs worked mainly in academia, not in the financial sector.&quot;<p>The article, by the way, is a &quot;leader&quot; (an editorial) leading into a special report section in which <i>The Economist</i> does more detailed reporting on the role of higher education around the world and its societal effects. A crucial question, which deserves more research, is to what degree attending higher education institutions actually provides education, making young people smarter and more capable, and to what degree it simply provides social signaling, distinguishing one job-seeker seeker who had wealth and leisure time to pursue a degree from another job-seeker who had fewer personal resources. It is not clear yet that postsecondary education adds as much value at the margins as primary education does. The clear development model contrast between east Asia and Africa is instructive about this issue: at independence, Zambia was more prosperous than Taiwan. Many African countries developed national universities and attempted to provide higher education to local elites as soon as they became independent. Many of the college graduates from those countries then became part of the brain drain of emigration to the West. Meanwhile, in east Asia the focus of national education policy was on broad access to good-quality primary and secondary education, and industrialization and transition to a post-industrial economy in those countries was built on a base of broad masses of literate, numerate workers. And, as today&#x27;s article reports, in the end east Asia ended up with more young people in higher education than in Africa anyhow, but along the way everyone became at least minimally well educated. For the same number of dollars, it probably does a country more good to improve primary education for the many than to broaden access to higher education for the few.",1450710998

The haproxy instance is packaged into a docker container that pulls the right certs from a private repo at build time. By building this container with different flags we can enable/disable ssl termination. The cert is a wild-card so we can drop this container anywhere in our stack and point dns at it and we get solid ssl termination. The certs themselves are obtained from godaddy, and all the prep that is required is to copy them to the correct repository. The haproxy containers cats them into the correct combined format at build time. This took substantially less than a morning to set up.",1450710505

514519,comment,513288,513851,0,0,thwarted,,,"In my experience, it's almost no effort.  If you want standalone machines or laptops, you make your own package repo, point all the machines at that and let them run updates.  You can install a cron job that lists packages and emails them out when the machine is connected so you can keep track of if and how packages actually are updated.  It's even easier with machines that are hardwired/non-portable, because you can NFS boot and do a read-only root setup and remove all the harddrives from the local machines.  Updates in this environment come from having them boot from a different root directory, allowing you to test new applications and upgrades without effecting everyone.  The NFS root one was for a callcenter (obviously a limited application set, but if you're deploying a large number of machines, many of them will have overlapping usage profiles).  Now a-days, I could see storing all the different configurations in git making rolling back, creating new versions, and deploying new versions easy (but you could use git for a windows install too).<p>I've deployed both setups, and support issues went way down compared to Windows.  The biggest recurring problem with the NFS root setup was hardware failures, but the ""fix"" there is to swap out the machine, which takes 5 minutes, and the user continues to work.  Without having to store files on the local machine, by having NFS home directories, there's no need to copy files over to give someone new hardware either.  With standalone machines, the backup strategy is even easier also, because you KNOW the user can only write to their home directory.<p>The hardest part of the NFS root was going through and changing all the configs to not require local write access (like for logging) or having it mount a ramdisk scratch area, and if you're experienced with Linux, this shouldn't be problem.  I know there are projects out there that are supposed to make this easier and do a lot of work, so it may be even easier now.",1236919473

Right now, for people willing to pre-pay, I offer discounts that amount to almost that much.  pay for a year and get 20% off.  (10% for 6 months, etc...)   Also, when I lower prices on a plan, I lower prices for all my existing customers.  It is important, I think, if you want easy to manage customers, to treat your non-complainers as well as your complainers.

Based on that and the standard docs, it looks like it was lost in the standard library reorganization.

",,"So I was checking out the latest TED publications :<p>and these two posts really got me thinking :<p>http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/pattie_maes_demos_the_sixth_sense....<p>and<p>http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/joseph_pine_on_what_consumers_want...<p>the first post is about enabling tech (see also www.microvision.com
and what they are doing with upcoming phones for how this ties into
the now)<p>The second - i like the concept of the quality of the consumer
experience as being important (back to basics),<p>So is the iphone just the beginning.  not a beginning of phones, but a
beginning in how we integrate computers and services into the real
world using on demand services + physical gestures and environment.<p>What would this then mean - is there going to be opportunities to
extend the reach of software into almost everything we do ?<p>How much of what we do today with software is going to have to be
changed or redeveloped ?<p>Is the 6th sense demo above a good example of the semantic  web ?  ie.
not just key words but also applications and services about your
current context ?  is this going to need other search tech (ie. how do
I know I am looking at a plane ticket , and what operations can be
done around this ticket).<p>Will it be an app store model ? If not what model for getting the apps
to the user when they need it ?  Who will provide such search
technology ?  ie. how does the system know what it is looking at ?
how do we add meaning to gestures in our context.  ie. when reading a
book - can we download new gesture - action maps on demand and then
present them using cool ajax+ type services ?<p>Services that work with product vendors to develop  and publish meta
data for their products and then get that data into the hands of the
consumer.  what and how to deliver ?  who to partner with ? what
competitive advantage can someone get by using this tech and how best
to present their brand/products and services - i think we are moving
beyond just ""shopping carts"" now, but to the next generation.   its
now more than web development - is web development going to become
part of every product (since the web and the real world are going to
join ?).<p>(okay, i am on a bit of TED binge but this also ties in :
http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/joseph_pine_on_what_consumers_want...<p>- the ability to combine software with sound zones ?  ie. a voice
appears in you ear while looking at a product ?
)<p>Mashups start to take on a whole bigger meaning.<p>What about custom apps / services that can tailor the customer
experience to a users immediate context.  These are some pretty
exciting opportunities.  And it can be done by 2-4 guys in garage -
that's US  (ie. the collective us) by the way.<p>With all the bad news we see, just thought a different view point may

514511,comment,513183,514469,0,0,lsc,,,"thanks for the feedback!   I'm looking at eucalyptus for provisioning.  I want something standard.  the optimal situation is one where you can easily move from me to another provider and back.   the idea is that you'd run your backup images on ec2, but mostly run through prgmr (or whoever is cheapest at the time)  for your day to day needs.   You'd have the instant provisioning if you need to expand right away or if the guy running the cheap provider gets hit by a bus, but you'd be able to save money running with the cheap provider most of the time<p>Automatic provisioning would also allow me to drop the price on my smaller images.  (right now I charge you $4 per account, plus $1 for every 64Mb ram you want every month.)<p>I give you console access, and access to PVGRUB, so you can change your kernel, or boot into a read-only rescue image I provide if you mess up your own image beyond recoverability.  Any easier interfaces will be built using whatever provisioning API I end up with (like I said, right now I'm looking at Eucalyptus, but I haven't implemented anything yet)<p>the idea is that if you have managed servers before, the concept of a remote rebooter, a serial console, and a read only rescue image (a cdrom in the drive)  will be familiar to you.<p>I don't think I want to get rid of the cheap plans.  I meet lots of interesting people that way. I've hired a few of them, with good results.  But on the other hand, I think my larger plans are a much better deal.    Personally, I agree with you on the 64MiB plans, I'd rather pay the extra dollar to double my ram, but some other people disagree. I sell more 64Mb plans than 128Mb plans.  (though, like I said, the 256Mb plan is the most popular.)   I've got some people running NetBSD (which runs fine in 64M, if you aren't doing much)  and others who upload custom linux distros, replacing sshd with dropbear.  But then, I know at least one customer who lives (in China) on what amounts to about USD$200/month, so I imagine he cares a lot more about that one dollar than you or I do.<p>I like the sort of people you meet running these low-cost services (the big problem is making it unfriendly to spammers and other scum.  I run snort on my outgoing traffic, proactively monitoring for abuse, which helps.)  and I think the contacts you make on the low end (because even us wealthy bay area nerds can be pretty cheap sometimes.)  often help with the high-end stuff, too.  It certainly has allowed me to up my consulting rates, and it has gotten me a book deal.  <a href=""http://nostarch.com/xen.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nostarch.com/xen.htm</a>   (Yes, I got someone who went to college to help.  Also, most of it I wrote when I was not this tired.)<p>I compete on price because I don't have sales skills.   I understand I need to make my website look better (and start buying hardware ahead of time)  but I will always be at a disadvantage there.   From my point of view, selling 10x as many images at 1/2 the cost (which seems to be about what happened last time I lowered my prices)  seems like a damn good deal.   I don't have to deal with salespeople or even focus on sales skills.  I focus on building out new hardware and keeping my system reliable, and people keep coming.<p>with the price of dual-rank 4GB registered ecc ddr2 modules coming down, I will soon be able to move to 64MB ram per server rather than my current 32GB ram.  (to give you an idea, right now each 32GB ram/ 8 core box sets me back around $2K, including disk.)<p>I've been doing this since '05...  well, I was jerking around with FreeBSD jails before that, but I moved to Xen (Xen 2.0 on NetBSD)  in December of '05.   when ec2 came out, they were cheaper than I was.  It looked like the end, and I even warned my customers and quit.  (I kindof screwed myself there.)  But it became clear that ec2 had no intention of lowering prices.<p>With my next server, I will experiment with providing more disk space (via NFS or ISCSI from an OpenSolaris storage unit.)<p>but yeah, this is all home built.  Dell?  why would i pay extra for a box with only 8 ram slots?    There's almost always enough spare parts for another server in the garage.  My new workstation (the parts are in the mail) will also use the same hardware, so that's something else I could pull from.  But since I switched to new hardware (sometime in '07) the only hardware failure I've had was a disk (and that was half of a mirrored pair, so I was able to replace it at my leisure.)<p>It's all standard stuff, though, so if worst came to worst, I could always run down to fry's and get the parts I need.  (not that I regularly buy anything but retail-packaged hard drives from Fry's, for quality and price reasons.  But if someone was down, I could do it.)<p>Really, assembling computers is easier than jerking around with the salesguy long enough to get the 'real price'  at least for me, and I'm something of a paranoid asshole when it comes to ESD (you see, for quite some time now I have been the guy who gets woken up in the middle of the night when a server mysteriously reboots.   It doesn't take many of those before you are willing to perform any ritual that might make your server even slightly more reliable.)<p>Now, I do have a lot of good price competition in the below-512MiB size range... but it seems that few competitors discount the higher ram amounts.    I wonder if it is because they are using Dell or other hardware that only has 8 ram slots, requiring the more expensive 4GB modules?  or if it's just 'If you need eight gigabytes, you can afford to pay through the nose'  ?",1236918746

My friendly response to the suggestion that I should consider mostly what subject a person has earned a Ph.D. in as the basis for whom to believe on what subject is that sometimes good ideas for one subject come from people who learned another subject. Sometimes that's the best way to make progress in a subject that has become stuck in outmoded theories. I observe that Ph.D. psychologists<p>1) were taken by surprise by Flynn's research on IQ test score trends over time, having initially predicted precisely the opposite trend,<p>2) proposed very stringent standards for acceptable data before believing the trend was real (and Flynn credits Jensen, who has just the sort of credentials you have recommended, as being especially tough in demanding certain kinds of evidence),<p>3) reviewed his publications before allowing them to appear in the leading journals in the field of psychology,<p>4) invited Flynn to attend major conferences written up in specialized monographs with acknowledged experts in psychology,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Intelligence-No-233-Novartis-Foundation/dp/0471494348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Intelligence-No-233-Novartis-Fo...</a><p>5) praised his work in standard textbooks on human intelligence,<p>6) devoted whole monographs specifically to his findings,<p><a href=""http://books.apa.org/books.cfm?id=431712A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.apa.org/books.cfm?id=431712A</a><p>and generally accorded Flynn greater honor as a researcher on psychological phenomena than most psychologists gain in a lifetime.<p><a href=""http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521741477"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=978...</a><p>Anyway, scientific issues aren't decided by credentials, but by data.

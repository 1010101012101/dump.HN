It is difficult to find a phone with two of those qualities, much less all four.<p>My first hardware advantage was that they make Apple's chips, learn from Apple, and they save by letting Apple take much of the R&D cost.  Apple is concerned about this and will likely be taking their chip production elsewhere. [1]<p>Let's be realistic: Apple hardware is always more expensive.  I'm not talking single-unit profit, Apple is well-known for their high markups.  I'm talking overall market dominance.  The Galaxy S II is already outselling the iPhone 4 in the UK. [2]  The preorders in Korea for the Galaxy S II are much higher than the iPhone 4 release. [3] The <i>first</i> Galaxy S is outselling the iPhone 4 in Japan! [4]<p>Software sales are not the software advantage, involving quality devs from the community is the advantage.  Samsung <i>doesn't need to spend as much on marketing and software dev because the community is already helping them</i>.  Just look at the ridiculous amount of free press that one move has given them, and the CM port isn't even to beta yet! [5]<p>My second hardware advantage is absolutely their AMOLED tech.  They are by far the leaders in OLED, Sony is the only other major player and they are looking at combining with Toshiba's LCD division in order to keep up. [6]  If you are a consumer who prefers an OLED smartphone (as I do), the Galaxy S is the only choice.  Again, Samsung manufacturers their own screens, simplifying the process.  Googling 'best smartphone display' does not reflect any advantage besides Apple's giant marketing machine.<p>If you have evidence to the contrary, I'd love to read it!  But I think Samsung is the clear winner.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-to-outsource-a4-and-a5-production-ipad-2-with-enhanced-a4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-to-outsource-a4-and-a5-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mynextfone.co.uk/news/article/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-tops-iphone-4-sales-in-uk-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mynextfone.co.uk/news/article/samsung-galaxy-s-ii...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2011/05/03/galaxy-s-ii-beats-iphone-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2011/05/03/galaxy-s-ii-beats-iphone-4...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.redmondpie.com/samsung-galaxy-s-outsells-iphone-4-in-japan-for-q1-2011/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redmondpie.com/samsung-galaxy-s-outsells-iphone-4...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=galaxy+s+ii+cyanogenmod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&#3...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/06/08/sony-and-toshiba-to-merge-oled-and-lcd-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/06/08/sony-and-toshiba-to-mer...</a>",1308250482

We (Visual Website Optimizer) are hosted on Linode since beginning but have experienced degradation of service lately particularly around network availability. There is at least one minor outage every month in their Newark data center (planning around network outage is much harder). While their support is responsive, these regular outages affect our business in a very significant manner. Every time we contact them, their staff just says these outages _happen_ and unavoidable and I cannot believe they are okay with it.<p>Maybe it is to do with their increased customer base, but earlier these outages were much less frequent and we enjoyed the service.<p>We own 25+ servers with them and have lately given thought of moving to some other provider.

A customer had a problem where they'd overlaid a new logical file on top of an old logical file.  Where these actual files, this would just have overwritten the old file, but since these were directories, we got a mishmash of pieces of two different logical files overlaid in the same directory, and of course our software got confused as hell.

There are lots of other pitfalls associated with not quoting things in shell scripts, like this common one:<p><pre><code>    if [ $foo -eq ""bar"" ];
</code></pre>
will cause an error if $foo isn't set or is an empty string, while this will work correctly:<p><pre><code>    if [ ""$foo"" -eq ""bar"" ];
</code></pre>
Bonus that your syntax highlighter can highlight the arguments.  My rule is that flags aren't quoted, but paths and other parameters are.",1308249153

2662425,comment,2661824,2661824,1,0,rranshous,,,"I bought my first macbook pro when the thunderbolt hit so that I could support 3 monitors in the future. I've overall been pretty pleased with it. I would be 100% more pleased if it didn't cost me ~3K. When I use something which has such a relatively high cost I expect a lot.<p>The things I do not like about the hardware:<p>* Once you start doing something CPU heavy it sounds as though a jet is taking off from your desk<p>* I've already had to return one due to overheating<p>* Mine makes a _super_ annoying small ""clicking"" noise when you torque it in any way. It sounds as though two internal pieces don't quite meet, but touching the case causes them to meet and possibly ""stick"" (will happen when you push down w/ your palm against the body, click the trackpad, move it etc)<p>* My (annoyingly located) ctrl key pops off at least once a day. This seems to be due to my torquing it slightly when using it as a modifier key. All keys may suffer from this, ctrl certainly seems to suffer the most<p>* the stock hard drive is _slowwww_. This can not be over stated.<p>* There are no hardware lights which indicate IO activity (very frustrating when you are just staring at your unresponsive computer)<p>* All the ports (except CD) are on one side of the body<p>* The space between the keys seems to be a dirt / grunge magnet.",1308247200

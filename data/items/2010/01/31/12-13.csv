In the evening he gets 'friended' by a young lady offering a free thumb drive (or herself).  How much training are western corporations giving their international staff about high-tech security?",1264942701

I really dislike the arbitrage model where the middleman tries to capture all the profit at the expense of the supplier and the consumer. I like the fixed margin model (like Apple's). I think it's good for everybody.",1264942475

Wouldn't that count as a major upgrade? (It's still one version behind the desktop counterpart, but at least it supports all the features of Flash 9 instead of a Lite subset.)",1264941840

The whole point about the ipad is the whole experience, as with every Apple products.<p>Also the 2 computers in one idea is quite ridiculous if you ask me. I hope they add some sort of sync, but if it is as buggy as their linux OS, it promises to be awful.<p>In short, this is the opposite of an apple product : \nBad user experience, useless display of technology, and weak hardware.<p>I'm no fan of apple but it's gonna take a better product to do better than the iPad<p>EDIT : Understanding how software works would be the first step in here.

1090425,comment,1089750,1089750,0,0,Mz,,,"Elitism does have a negative connotation.  I think ""excellence"" would have worked better in the title.  For that matter, I don't really understand why the word ""economics"" is in the title.  The title doesn't seem to fit the article all that well -- at least not to me.  The article is about the culture and design process at Apple, not Steve Jobs per se. Yes, Steve Jobs is intrinsically part of that culture.  He founded the company and he is an important leader within it.  No, you can't really separate the two at this point.  But he isn't actually a one man show.<p>I like the quote used within the article that ""A defining quality of Apple has been design restraint.""  I think that basic idea should have somehow made it into the title, rather than the name Steve Jobs and this incomprehensible, seemingly irrelevant, phrase ""Economics of Elitism"".  Perhaps they could have just said ""At Apple, Less is More"" and then explained why.",1264941570
1090424,comment,1090180,1090180,0,0,lallysingh,,,"When will hardware makers realize that you can't half-ass (or in this case, 1/8 to 1/16th-ass) the software stack for a new usage paradigm?  Assembled parts does not a system make.<p>Tablet PCs have sucked for years for the simple reason that they just wanted to sell touch-screen, keyboardless laptops.  They're completely different systems from the user's point of view, and just shoving an onscreen keyboard and handwriting recognizer doesn't cut it.  Proper tablet computing is 10 years of user interface and systems research that hasn't (afaik) been done.<p>Notice how apple started with an appliance (an ipod touch) and scaled it up to just be a larger appliance.  They recognized the problem and (not-very-cleverly) avoided it.<p>Sadly, we're going to see more bad ideas like this for a while; there are too many hardware vendors who simply don't understand the whole system stack.  It's no coincidence that the only vendor to do a tablet that wasn't a desktop OS bolted-with-crap is Apple, a full-system vendor.",1264941537
1090423,comment,1090008,1090318,0,0,demallien,,,"No, your analogy isn't right. Or rather, using your analogy, no one is being prevented from competing with Apple either, all you need to do is build your own wildly successful gadget with AppStore. Easy!<p>No, a better analogy would be to look at how Google restricts use of their APIs.  I remember a couple of years ago, I wanted to geo-code a couple of hundred addresses of handicapped parking spaces in Paris for a handicapped friend.  Google's terms of service required me to pay money for this access, because a couple of hundred hits, run over a few minutes, was considered commercial use of their service.  I didn't have an automatic right to use Google's service in an innovative way.  And indeed, I tried it anyhow, just to see how they reacted, the server stopped responding after the first 50 or so hits.<p>Both companies are very restrictive in how you, as a developer, may use the services that they provide.  And they are both near-monopoly providers of those services. As others have pointed out, both are publicly traded companies that are there to make a profit, and both will put restrictions on developers that they feel are using their systems in ways that <i>they</i> have decided are inappropriate.",1264941515

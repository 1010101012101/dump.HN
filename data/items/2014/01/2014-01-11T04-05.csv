7041648,comment,7040332,7041482,38,0,swisspol,,,"[Everpix founder here] Interesting idea and no we didn&#x27;t try negotiating with Amazon. Not sure how much room there is here?<p>However it&#x27;s important to keep in mind in a situation like this, and at this scale of burn rate, you&#x27;re not looking for a solution to shave off a few thousands $ left and right, which is kicking the can down the road (if even), but for a long term solution.<p>The key problem here is that I don&#x27;t think you can realistically switch a business built on the VC funding track to the bootstrap track without the collateral damage of killing your company&#x27;s essence i.e. the product.<p>For instance: when suggesting to have fewer employees, that is implying you have room for that or that your employees are interchangeable, which is far from the truth. It&#x27;s not like we had 5 tech support people, and we could have downscaled to 3. We had hired quite slowly and were already as lean as it gets i.e. 1 person per project: iOS, Web, Infrastructure, Science, Design, Imaging / QA. All these folks were working at full capacity managing a multi-platform service managing hundreds of millions of full-res photos with ~100 servers, displaying photo collections of 10,000+ photos in very responsive apps, and running cutting edge computer vision science at a scale no other consumer photo startup was doing (the closest was the semantic search in Google+ Photos). You can certainly cut salaries (which we did and only works up to a certain point in the very competitive SV hiring market), but you can&#x27;t remove positions which would be akin to extending a bridge to nowhere.<p>Regarding the infrastructure expense, I shared some thoughts here: <a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=704164"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7041640</a>",1389416360

7041643,comment,7039043,7039989,3,0,bzbarsky,,,"Ah, OK, it sounded like you&#x27;d picked Princeton in particular.<p>And yes, there are substantial differences between the Ivies, and between other &quot;otherwise prominent&quot; institutions.  And even within a single school it can fluctuate widely, whether due to trends or chance.  For example, <a href""http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/students/diversity.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/students/diversity.html</a> shows a pretty wide range in African American enrollment numbers at MIT over the last 4 years (ranging from 5.3% to 7.7%) and similar fluctuations for Latinos (but at a much higher base level).<p>Another confounding factor here is that even though the applicant pools and matriculating classes for these schools have gotten much more national than they used to be, the matriculation demographics still tend to skew somewhat local.  MIT, for example, has a disproportionate number of undergrads from Massachusetts: according to <a href""http://web.mit.edu/registrar/stats/geo"" rel""nofollo"">http://web.mit.edu/registrar/stats/geo/</a> there are 340 of them out of 4080 US students total (8%) this year, while the population of MA, at 6.6 million, is only 2% of the US population.  Similarly, <a href""http://www.princeton.edu/admission/applyingforadmission/admission_statistics/map.ht"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.princeton.edu/admission/applyingforadmission/admi...</a> says Princeton has 204 students from NJ this year, but only 38 from MA, while the population of NJ is only 1.5 times that of MA at most.<p>Since different parts of the country have different racial breakdowns (MA is 7% African American, not 12%, for example) this complicates any analysis of the goings-on at such schools.  :(",1389416096

7041640,comment,7040332,7041572,10,0,swisspol,,,"I keep reading comments from this angle, so I&#x27;ll throw in my 2 cents as an Everpix founder :)<p>I can <i>assure</i> you that without the facilities of AWS, which saved us a ton of time and development overhead early on, there would have been no Everpix. Period. Actually, the very first Everpix was on Google App Engine, but that&#x27;s a different story.<p>As an early stage startup, whose core business is not building infrastructure, do you really want to be in the business of managing for instance your own S3 type storage with the same performance and reliability at 200+ TB scale? We never lost a single user photo or account. Never lost a database server either. When your users trust you with their life photo collection, that does matter.<p>Then of course, if your company starts gaining traction, your bills increase so things change. As a matter of fact, post Series-A, our plan was to switch out of AWS, concurrently to our infrastructure&#x27;s redesign to go from managing 100s of million of photos to billions.<p>Doing the switch earlier would have been premature IMO: there was no one the team with such experience, even less bandwidth. The opportunity cost would have been significant on all the other aspect of the company. Let&#x27;s not forget the required upfront capital which takes some time to recoup so savings would not kick in from day 1. Finally there&#x27;s also the fact our infrastructure was still rapidly evolving (type of EC2 machines used, database architecture, etc...), so even buying reserved instances was very difficult as there was a good chance of buying machines we would not need anymore 6 months down the road ultimately wasting money (it did happen).<p>So what we did instead what focusing on driving continuously driving down AWS costs through various optimizations - if you were to look at our dashboard graphs, you would notice AWS costs were growing slower than users / photos, which reflected that work.<p>Long story short, the infrastructure was paying for itself through subscription revenues. The real &quot;killer&quot; was payroll. I use quotes because in this type of business, it&#x27;s expected to have payroll your largest expense - there was no surprise. BTW note that the team was already 1 person = 1 entire product component like iOS or infrastructure so quite lean and highly productive. For a VC backed consumer business, you pretty much need the VC money to cover these fixed costs until you reach profitability.",1389416043

7041508,comment,7040878,7041119,2,0,belluchan,,,"I was the direct manager for software engineers at a big public hosting company. Being a line manager was miserable. I thought going into management I&#x27;d have more ability to influence things but I had less. I had no time to write code, and so I wasn&#x27;t taking part in technology decisions outside of approving with whatever the team decided, and they are smart people, they didn&#x27;t need any hand holding. I couldn&#x27;t influence anything at all with the director who managed me, all I did was communicate whatever he wanted to the engineers. I couldn&#x27;t influence other teams. I basically sat in meetings, listened to 1-1&#x27;s and just relayed information. Another team had someone struggling and so I got to do a bit of mentoring there, but I didn&#x27;t have to be a manager to do that. It just seemed like I was always fighting with HR for my engineers, fighting my boss for my engineers, trying to get other teams to respond to my engineer&#x27;s needs. It sucked. I think the people on my team were happy with me, but I want to write code. I want to make things. Engineering has a career track that makes sense, when I looked at managers who were my peers I saw politics, and one-upsmanship. I just want to make good products. I don&#x27;t want to play mind games. I want to do the best I can. I don&#x27;t need to rise up the ranks. I just want to learn and do cool things with software.<p>It was a great learning experience though, because before I became a manager I thought that was like a natural progression, something that I had to do, something that I felt I couldn&#x27;t shirk from, something where people recognized me for my skills, but in reality it&#x27;s just a shit job, a dead end, unless you&#x27;re one of the few who advances up the latter, because you know what, all of my managers and my manager&#x27;s managers were all just relaying their manager&#x27;s will down the pyramid.<p>When you are a software engineer you see things you do create value. You build things that work and do stuff. When you&#x27;re a manager, I have no idea what I contributed. What did I do last week where I earned my pay? I have no idea.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I survived and am back to writing code. It involved getting a new job at a new place as soon as possible before I got too rusty. I was writing code at home all that time so that helped.",1389412806

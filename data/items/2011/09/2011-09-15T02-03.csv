And you cant give iOS apps even the option to run continuously in the background without sacrificing battery life and foreground app performance<p>This is a typical Gruberism of false logic.  He starts with the notion that all Apple's decisions are holy and right.  He then derives conclusions by extrapolating from that.<p>There is no reason that tablets cannot achieve fantastic battery life while running background processes.  They certainly need to be designed to achieve it. Existing Android tablets support background processes and multitasking and get comparable battery life to the iPad - typically we're talking a sacrifice of < 10% battery life to achieve an incredible expansion of utility.  And this is not taking into account the fact that Android is a less efficient OS overall (utilizing less hardware acceleration, running most tasks inside a Dalvik VM instead of native, etc.)  Even the iPad itself evidently does background processing as you can have it play music, give you calendar reminders and all kinds of other things happen <i>in the background</i> even when it is in sleep state.",1316055265

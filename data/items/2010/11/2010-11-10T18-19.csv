1891421,comment,1888295,1889328,0,0,Aqua_Geek,,,"Yes and no. About a year before I started this job, I founded a digital publishing company with a friend, so I was working this 40 hr/week job AND on my startup whenever I ""got done"" for the day.<p>It got to the point where I finally took a step back and realized that I was killing myself. My crappy work schedule mixed with late, late nights on my startup was a recipe for disaster. I also started having some RSI issues, which I'm still dealing with today (not being physically able to work another minute is a pretty strong motivator to stop for the day... <g>).<p>Just let go - I know it's hard to do if you're working for a startup, particularly if it's <i>your</i> startup. But you need to draw the line somewhere - work a set number of hours a day, or work until a set time and then <i>clock out</i>. Work hard/smart during those hours, and you'll get the satisfaction of knowing you did what you could that day and it's enough.<p>Co-workers/founders are a terrific source of motivation - especially if they're constantly committing quality code. But don't let that drive turn into something bad, or the guilt will get to you and destroy whatever motivation you had for the project. Programming because you feel you have to is no fun and is not sustainable - you <i>will</i> burn out.",1289415548

Actually, it looks like signup anchors to the pricing section, which is kind of confusing. Similarly, I feel like those links a the bottom should actually bring you to different pages rather than anchoring. It's a little awkward clicking the pricing link with the pricing already in view and having nothing happen. When I click that link I feel like it should bring me more information about pricing then whats already displayed. As a more general rule, I think anchored links are only useful in excessively long pages to ease navigation, such as with a table of contents. I think this page is far too short to necessitate having these type of links.<p>Edit: Also, I might avoid using email address as the login. It seems that in a business case like this you'll have multiple people accessing the same account, and it might not make sense if a hiring manager quits to continue to have to use her email address to login after the fact.",1289414855

1891387,comment,1890080,1890080,0,0,Anechoic,,,"Having ordered business cards from Vistaprint and Overnight Prints, let me make a couple of observations:<p>* Vistaprint had decent print quality, but IMO their paper quality left something to be desired. The biggest issue with VP (again IMO) is that their business cards are standard-sized, they are slightly smaller. It makes the card stand out a bit, but you have to decide if it stands out in a good way or a bad way<p>* I've used Overnight Prints for the vast majority of business cards. I've only used the ""Value Cards"" products (basically printed on a laser printer"" as opposed to the offset press printing of the Premium cards. They use a very thick stock, and I often get positive comments on the ""feel"" of the card stock. At first glance the print quality looks pretty good, but upon a closer look you can see that the cards were printed on a laser printer (I presume that the offset-printed cards look better).<p>* The biggest 'gotcha' with Overnight Prints (at least the Value cards) is the color consistency - that is to say, there is none. They don't pay attention to embedded color profiles, and <i>every</i> order I've made the colors come out different. I don't mind too much because I know that my clients aren't comparing colors and I figure most of my cards either get scanned/transcribed into electronic address books and then put away, or get tossed out. But if you're someone who obsesses over the color consistency of your printed material, definitely stay away from the Value Cards (again I don't know if things are better with the Premium Cards).",1289414781

1891370,comment,1890574,1890574,0,0,lkrubner,,,"I think it is difficult to get these movements going among individuals. I think it is easier to establish this as a cultural norm among those businesses that make money from open source. If the goal is to raise more money for open source projects, then the fundraising will work best if it is some dedicated amount of a company's profits. I think the consumers of open source technologies would appreciate knowing that some tiny percentage of their funds go back to the projects that make it all possible. For instance, if every ISP (using open source software) was committed to sending .01% of their profits to the Apache Foundation, it would offer Apache a degree of independence from those who currently pay its bills, and I, for one, would be pleased to know that some of my money was going to the software that makes my sites possible.<p>The donations need to be automated as much as possible. At wpquestions.com we send out some small amount of money every month to the people who have created plugins for WordPress, whenever a question is posted about that plugin. The whole process is automated, no one needs to think about it. I think establishing this as a cultural norm throughout the open source community would help make the open source eco-system more vibrant. And lots of small payments from many small businesses probably allows greater freedom of maneuver (for the open source projects) than having a few big projects paid for by  a few big corporations - simply looking at Oracle's handling of Java convinces me of the dangers of having all funding come from just a few sources.",1289414449

And luckily Microsoft did understand that and they are doing good with Internet Explorer 9 but again they are making things their own way and that's what is bad about them.
If Microsoft thinks it needs something they are always developing it on their own without looking what other developers are doing and how they solved those problems. No, they have always this one Microsoft solution doesn't play really good with the rest of the world (and sometimes even with Microsoft software).

As long as CPU time is available, an instance can use the full capacity of four cores. If there is contention for CPU time, every instance gets an equal share of CPU, which is also their fare share of CPU, because all the instances on a box are the same size/pricepoint.  Further, larger instances are shared with a proportionally smaller number of other instances.<p>My experience, which seems to be shared by just about anyone who has published benchmarks, is that Linode is appropriately conservative on the degree to which they oversell CPU, because generally, it appears that a task that wants 100% of four cores does in fact get close to 100% of four cores.<p>The only thing to look out for is that there is quite a difference in single threaded performance between their newer hardware and their older hardware. Our app is written in one of the popular interpreted dynamic languages. Generic benchmarks for that language showeda 2-3x difference on some tests when run on the different hardware, and our app showed similar differences on CPU bound tasks.<p>There are a few implications of this:<p>First, it complicates things when you try to make your staging environment mirror production.  The quick check is to look at /proc/cpuinfo and see if clock,cache and model line up.  If not, open a ticket and ask them to migrate instances so things match.<p>Second, while they try to size things appropriately so that your guaranteed CPU Is the same, regardless of which generation of host you are on, your peak CPU is going to vary dramatically since you get 4 cores, irregardless.",1289413147

Even Ruby is fast enough to do most things faster than I can perceive, but I know from practical experience that there are fast and slow ways to do those things even in a ""slow"" language. I've tweaked Ruby algorithms before to make programs go from ""OMG Ruby is so slow!"" to perceptually the same as a C program (though a few tenths of a second slower in absolute terms).<p>What you're arguing here is that because there are some cases where pure Python is simply not fast enough, there is no point in thinking about performance at all in a Python program. It's a false dichotomy. There's a wide range of performance options between ""just forget about performance altogether"" and ""rewrite the entire application in C++.""",1289413107

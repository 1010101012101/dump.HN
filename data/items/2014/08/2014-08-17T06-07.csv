I think that I&#x27;ve at least had a taste of the &quot;real world&quot;.<p>Secondly, the idea that I lack some kind of mental capability to &quot;understand or imagine what is possible outside of the school&quot; is deeply flawed, and frankly unfounded. In fact, the condescension that arises from this statement is exactly the kind of attitude towards children that discourages them from taking risks and exploring independently.<p>I hope the next time you talk to or meet a 16 year old, you don&#x27;t assume that they lack any ability to understand the &quot;real world&quot;.",1408258689

There are many more studies that show that a play based education up until age 7 is superior to a rigorous academic education at the same age.<p>The evidence shows that it is very likely that spending an extra 2 years playing, and exploring is better than spending that time in the class practicing reading picture books.<p>Older children also progress faster, so an 8 year old who started learning to read at age 7 is reading much more sophisticated material than a 6 year old who started at age 5.

DOI: 10.1037/a0022697 ABSTRACT Although homeschooling is growing in prevalence, its educational outcomes remain unclear. The present study compared the academic achievements of homeschooled children with children attending traditional public school. When the homeschooled group was divided into those who were taught from organized lesson plans (structured homeschoolers) and those who were not (unstructured homeschoolers), the data showed that structured homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared with children attending public school. Exploratory analyses also suggest that the unstructured homeschoolers are achieving the lowest standardized scores across the 3 groups.",1408256472

Due to its simplicity for a large group of naïve users, the library will likely be prone to over- and misuse.  Since the library uses guessing as its method of decoding, and by definition a guess may be wrong, this will lead to some unnecessary data corruption in situations where use of this library (and the resulting data corruption) was not actually needed.<p>2. The library uses a one-size-fits-all model in the area of guessing encodings and language.  This has historically proven to be less than a good idea, since different users in different situations use different data and encodings, and your library’s algorithm will not fit all situations equally well.  I suggested that a more tunable and customizable approach would indeed be the best one could do in the cases where the encoding is actually not known.  (This minor complexity in use of the library would also have the benefit of discouraging overuse in unwarranted situations, thus also resolving the first point, above.)<p>You have, as far as I can see, not yet responded substantively to the first point, and for the second point you have only asserted that your user-uncustomizable alorithm is superior to any possible other automatically derived algorithm.<p>Yet, <i>I</i>’m the one who deserves a <i>Plonk</i>?

Discuss things with them. Let them soak as much understandable speech as they can between years 0 and 2. This will have a far more profound effect in their life rather than did they learn to read at 4 or 8 years of age.<p>Could you specify what is horrifying about the previous post? Why would it be more important for a 5 year old to learn to read rather than, say, spend their time building Legos, practice crafts or climbing into trees? Like another poster stated, most kids in Finland do not start to formally learn to read until they are 6 (preschool, if the parents want so) and at the latest when they enter primary school (7). I would claim Finland has a pretty good public primary education system.<p>Pushing kids to do too much too soon has no advantages, imho. There are skills that are best started acquiring at a youngish age but you will have to convince me pretty hard that reading is one of them. Kids have this natural curiosity to an amazing variety of things. But what those things are can be quite random. The best way to have them learn something is to apply this natural curiosity - i.e. find what they are interested in - and the support them in this activity. This does not mean allowing them play videogames or watch cartoons whole the whole day.<p>I would say if the kids like it and want to then sure, teach them to read. But before 7, I would claim it is more valuable to find those things that they are really keen into and let them practice those. This creates a positive association to knowledge acquisition (the love of learning). And at that age they soak information and skills like sponges if they are motivated and have the mental capacity to grasp the concepts.",1408255275

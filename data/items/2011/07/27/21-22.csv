No. Is the phone manufacturer liable? No. Should I be sued when I recommend my accountant to my friend and the accountant defrauds him?

No.<p><i>Anything less is simple villainy.</i>\n<i>This is a test of human decency.</i><p>Calling this villainy is one of the most hyperbolic statements Ive heard in living memory.

The transaction log goes to disk, but also stays in memory. Scanning it linearly isn't that slow.

In 71 MZ and 90 DZ pairs\n  with complete diagnoses, pairwise concordance was similar (0.129\n  overall, 0.155 MZ, 0.111 DZ; relative risk, 1.39; 95% confidence\n  interval, 0.63-3.1).

You ask what Google's incentive is to build the site if they can't make people download Chrome to use it, which is a bizarre question that seems to admit that Google is not about open standards at all. If Google was all about open standards, it wouldn't matter which browser you used.<p>The reality is that Google is not some benevolent open source company as they're often portrayed but are a gigantic advertising company with a financial incentive in getting you onto their products, which gives them data to index for advertisers. Chrome, for example, automatically interfaces with the Google search engine by default.

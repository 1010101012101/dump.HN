However if your product sucks then a good name isn't going to fix that. If people can't remember or spell your name, that can kill your word of mouth marketing.<p>When a startup begins seeing success and can afford to buy a better name then in many cases re-branding is seriously considered.",1256878415

It has nothing to do with your presentation, and it's likely the audience wouldn't have noticed, anyway--so why point it out?<p>There is an exception to this rule, though: if the condition is A) painfully obvious, and B) out of your control, you can apologize.  Examples: air conditioners in room broken, or jackhammers next door.  But don't apologize for your own stuff; that's just tacky.",1256878286
911543,comment,911170,911512,0,0,btilly,,,"You know the missing mathematical background isn't actually that hard to learn.  And once you learn it, you may notice important details you're currently missing.<p>For instance the lecture you got annoyed with was covering how to correctly model a <i>second degree</i> differential equation.  So you know that d^2x/dx^2 = f(x, u).  This is a different and more complicated problem than a first order differential equation.  They handled it by turning it into a system of first order differential equations.  And then demonstrated how the obvious way to do it lead to numerical instability, creating a physically incorrect result.  And then they had to do more complex stuff to avoid the numerical instability.<p>The underlying concepts share a lot with a simple first order equation.  But the generality is letting you tackle and deal with issues that a simple model can't.  Plus the technique described can be expanded in a straightforward way to model a combination of interacting things.<p>But you froze up at the idea of linear algebra and didn't even realize that they were dealing with a much more complicated problem than you thought.",1256877985

In some cultures, this would be a normal part of doing business and it's commonly accepted.  In some places, you can even claim these 'bribes' against tax...!<p>Generally it comes down to being comfortable with your choices, and ensuring that everything you do is completely legal.<p>If you need to invest $1,000-$2,000 for a lawyer to write a legal opinion, and this will make it likely to safely get a deal worth $15,000, it may be the right decision.<p>Good luck!",1256877716

911528,comment,910071,910071,0,0,quant18,,,"I've always thought that a world where English was every country's sole official language would be <i>better</i> for preserving small minority languages. Typically, if you're a minority Kneebonian in Elbonia, you have a ""triple burden"":<p>1. You want to learn English or some other regional ""useful language"" to get a good job in an international company<p>2. You may want to learn/maintain your command of Kneebonese --- a ""useless language"" economically, but it gives you ethnic pride and access to Kneebonian community ""social capital""<p>3. Your government forces you to learn equally-useless Elbonese in the name of ""national unity"", e.g. by making it mandatory for high school exams. But learning it won't actually give you access to Elbonian ""social capital"", because of discrimination.<p>In practise, a significant proportion of Kneebonian parents relieve their kids of the ""triple burden"" by speaking Elbonese to them. Then 10-20 years later, you get a lot of Kneebonian kids who feel they have no other means to ""prove"" their ethnic identity, except demonstrating fierce ""Kneebonian PrYDe4LyFe bro!"" at every opportunity --- usually in the form of anti-Elbonian prejudice.<p>So losing the language doesn't necessarily kill the culture, but it does mean that it'll get twisted it  increasingly ugly shapes by kids trying to overcompensate for the loss of a big part of their heritage.",1256876529

Not to rag on PHP or Visual Basic, but people could get by with just memorizing certain keywords - or not solve hard problems by using a third-party plugin or googling for code snippets.<p>I hated my Automata and Functional Programming Language classes because I was forced to write out formal proofs to prove really obvious programs to be correct, or to demonstrate something arcane as the Turing machine. But it forced me to think about programming in a different light and find my own way to find the solution.<p>This reminds me to always to look under the hood of all of the web frameworks, data ORM's that I'm using and to improve my 3rd party libraries, in programming. Also in music, not to blindly play the scales or the tabs of popular music, but learn the different patterns, what makes a song tick, and composition.

The lecture covers numerical integration in an embedded system. If you know dx/dt = f(x,u) (where u is the input), the completely obvious approximation by computer is to execute x += dt * f(x, u) at intervals of dt seconds.

But West vs. East has a lot of special differences: ownership, farms, small and medium companies, political views, religion, etc...<p>For example North and South parts of West Germany differ in religion: protestant vs. catholic. East Germany OTOH has a larger atheist population.<p>From a long term cultural view, somebody from Rostock is not much different than somebody from Hamburg (where I live). It&#x27;s just that Hamburg had several decades economic success, and Rostock did not. This affects employment, job opportunities, population development, GDP, etc. The differences between the former East and West Germany are real, even though some are getting smaller. It will take more decades to change things. The equal living standard is a goal. Generally differences are okay and Germany had always states which had their own business/views/traditions - different from countries where there is a more centralized situation (UK/London, France/Paris, ...).",1415023199

8550751,comment,8550315,8550315,0,0,nostromoa,,,"The main risk after starting to have a heart attack (other than dying)and clearly realizing it, seems to be going into denial and not proceeding immediately to a hospital. That circus lasted almost two hours for me, so by the time the stent cleared the clot I was just on the edge of being on the way out (becoming unconscious). - I even had a smoke in the middle of the two hours before heading to the emergency room!<p>Next phase was the month to a year as one ponders whether one managed to induce heart failure (enough damage not to pump blood in sufficient quantities) when faced with the tiredness any exertion including rehab seems to induce. The possibility of always being tired IS DEPRESSING. Also there is the &quot;fun&quot; of pains in the area one felt the heart attack pain bringing the question of &quot;am I having another heart attack.&quot; And then there are all those stories about how great someone or other felt after having their arteries cleared as if one got a tune up...these stories are B.S. one is looking at about 6 months of not feeling great with any somewhat serious heart attack.<p>My overwhelming sentiment as the anesthetic set in before they cleared my Widow Maker and inserted a stent was, well, feeling pretty good and the notion there were &quot;worse ways to die,&quot; and a certain willingness to go with it if this was it. So I guess I&#x27;m not much scared of dying once there.<p>Mentioning the heart attack is devilish fun in a gathering because most males start to squirm immediately.<p>There is a disconnect between one feeling fairly back to oneself and other&#x27;s views of you who has had a heart attack(if they never had one). No one will learn from your example and stop smoking or eating less crap so don&#x27;t even bother to think so. You&#x27;ll be lucky if you manage to improve yourself your own bad habits.<p>After a while one resumes ones devil may care posture towards life with occasional reflective moments on when the 
&#x27;next one&#x27; will be and if there will be a next one(probably).<p>So as far as great revelations? Not many mostly mundane discoveries. A stent is better than being filleted. Being alive appears better than dead to those of us that are still alive. And next time I feel a heart attack I WILL GET MY ASS  TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM ASAP to reduce heart muscle damage that ensues the longer I wait.",1415023160

He made a radio and said that I could not have pain because this tooth was abnormal and had no nerve. I didn&#x27;t investigate further. Later I learned that hart pain can be linked to tooth pain.<p>I later had a huge pain in my elbow. It was as if a big nail was hammered through it. I then went to my cardiologist and he noticed a change in my ECG. I did a ECG under effort and he stopped it after a minute. My ECG became completely crazy under effort. I saw it later. From this point things went as routine work. Got a stent and everything is now ok.<p>So symptoms my differ. I never had chest pain. Only elbow pain. The tooth pain was also a hint I now monitor.

Thought it would be a total coincidence it&#x27;s my heart.<p>Even though it takes time to heal, 8 months later I have mostly &quot;healed from the healing process&quot;, and you will get there in time.

8550653,comment,8548751,8549747,0,0,Cowicide,,,"I recently worked with a specialized team that assisted some high-profile, quasi-governmental entities in comprehensively assessing the current state of Mac OS security.  Based upon that and other vectors, I&#x27;ve got some info that may or may not be of interest to yourself and others here.<p>If you&#x27;re implying this new exploit and perhaps the other high-profile malware issues in more recents years is indicative of hacker interest due to surging Mac OS market share, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s entirely correct.<p>Outside of Apple iOS (mobile), Mac OS X (desktops and laptops) market share hasn&#x27;t risen relatively that much over the past decade or so.  And, in recent times, even the peak is only a few percentage points higher than it&#x27;s been for many years.<p>When Mac OS market share was lower back in its Mac OS 9 days, there were far more widespread, problematic malware issues (viruses, trojans, etc.) that were propagating fairly well in the wild (by Apple&#x27;s standards).  That scenario proves that hackers were interested in Mac OS devices even when the Mac OS market share was lower than it is today.<p>Since the 90&#x27;s, Macs have hovered around approximately 1 in 10 (give or take) of all computers in the United States with a customer base of a predominately higher income demographic.  In other words, one may very well get more money out of a smaller subset of Mac users than a larger group of typical Windows users.  Therefore, Macs have always been a target for a subset of hackers that, er... &quot;specialize&quot; in that kind of scenario.<p>In other words, while Mac OS market share may play some minor role in hacker interest in the platform overall in recent times, there hasn&#x27;t been a huge surge in market share that would account for some radically increased hacker interest.<p>The reason malware was drastically reduced on the Mac platform since it switched from OS 9 to OS X (based upon a flavor of UNIX) was because of the superior security Mac OS X afforded the platform compared to Mac OS 9.  That&#x27;s why even as market share gradually climbed, overall Mac OS malware dropped dramatically for most of the past decade until more recent years.<p>I think the relatively small increase in malware (compared to Mac OS 9) for Mac OS X in the last few years is due to the fact that over time hackers are more likely to find exploits the longer they poke and prod at an OS.  Also, over time, Apple programmers are increasingly likely to make mistakes here and there as time and piles of code goes on.<p>And, perhaps Apple is slipping in quality in regards to security for various reasons since their resources have been somewhat distracted with iOS devices in more recent years.  Plus, over time, the amount of hackers, hacking skills, knowledge and tools have been increasing and improving quite drastically worldwide especially more so in recent years.<p>On top of those issues, there&#x27;s been more attention brought to Apple via an iOS halo effect from iPads and iPhones that perhaps plays into more hacker interest in the Mac OS.  I also suspect that the abundance of high-profile Apple commercials over the years has perhaps influenced some hacker perceptions that the Mac OS platform is more ubiquitous than it really is.  And, the icing on the cake is perhaps more disgruntled hackers and hacktivists who are increasingly disillusioned or even hostile with the Apple brand for various reasons over the years.<p>But, as far as purely Mac OS X market share goes, there really hasn&#x27;t been that large of an uptick to prod properly educated hackers to take much more interest than they did a few years ago or even a decade ago overall based upon market share alone.",1415021544

8550631,comment,8550315,8550315,0,0,StefanPopp,,,"Last year when i was 27 i had a strange feeling in my chest after smoking a cigarette, i didn&#x27;t smoke for 4 years in row. After 2 minutes i got very nervous and i felt overall very strange.<p>Two days later i smoked another cigarette and the same feeling started again, but this time it felt like ants are running up my neck. After 5 minutes and calming down me teeth started to itch. From day to day i got more and more weaker. After 4 days i couldn&#x27;t walk more then 25 meters without pain in my chest and short breathing. Thankfully one of my co-workers dad is a doctor and he said that he wants to take a look on me. After i arrived at his office i had to walk up 20 stairs and when i opened the door i&#x27;ve fall down on the floor.<p>Immediately two people took me to a room where they checked some stuff. My doctor made some tests and he said that it doesn&#x27;t look like a heart attack but something is wrong with one of the lines on my ECG. He asked me if its ok to call the ambulance for doing more checks at the hospital. I said yes, please.<p>5 minutes later ambulance arrived and took me to the hospital. I was quite unsure if i should be happy or not as my doctor said it doesn&#x27;t look like a heart attack. In the emergency room they took my blood to check if troponin is in my blood. The test was negative. I told them my history and the history of my dad who had his first heart attack with 36. I had 92 kg at 172cm. They made some other checks and everything said my heart seems to be  normal, except one line on the ECK. The doctor said i have to stay for at least 1-2 days for additional tests.<p>First night, they check my blood pressure shortly before i slept. 180 / 130 @ 80 bpm. They gave me some stuff to get it down to a normal value. First morning, i woke up. I had pain in my chest so hard the i was close to fall out of the bed. Rolled left, rolled right. 2 minutes and 20 clicks on the emergency button later a nurse came into my room and gave me painkillers. 10 minutes later ECK + blood test. Everything negative except that one little line in the ECK. Two hours later i they made the first test. They brought me to the ultra sonic room were they took a look on my heart. 10 Minutes later they said, everything looks normal. One day later the next test. Cycling. I had to stop after 2 minutes and a pulse rate of 120bpm. The nurse asked me if i am serious that i cant ride more. They expected me to get up to 180bpm. The doctors got nervous, my blood tests are still negative, no troponin and the ECK is also negative, except one line. They decided to make a test called echocardiography. While watching my heart the gave me a medicament to speedup my heartbeat. When they hit 120bpm i started to sweat, at 130bpm they gave my emergency medicaments to calm me down. It took almost 30 minutes and 1 lorazepam to calm me down.<p>After that test they put me to the intensive care unit. For the first time they found troponin in my blood. I had 10+ cables all over my body. Every 4-5 hours they made blood tests, also when i slept. They gave me blood thinner and tranquilliser. After 4 days in intensive care unit they made a cardiac catheterization and they found a 99% closed vessel after 10 minutes. Another 10 minutes later i had my first stent. The complete process took around 45 minutes always with full consciousness. I felt horrible but i was so lucky that they found the problem. One day later the doctor told me what happened and what the future is. They said i can live a normal life without the risk of a heart attack but i have to change my life radically. So i did. One year later i am doing sports multiple times per week. I lost over 15kgs, never touched a cigarette again and i feel so much healthier now.<p>My doctor told me after everything was over that 3-4 weeks later i would be dead without help. My heart has no damage and only 2 little 30% spots are left. As long as i live a normal life and i don&#x27;t want to run marathon i wont have problems in the future. The little strange ECK line is also normal now =)<p>I hope that my english didn&#x27;t distract you at all, i want to show that even not normal signals of a heart attack can be a sign of much bigger problems coming up.",1415021096

Otherwise we will wallow trying to deal with symptoms forever.<p>Dunno if anyone has yet mentioned one of the basic contradictions inherent in capitalism which could very well be at the root of what we experience. Means of production are private (factories, etc) and the owners as almost all players in capitalism take care to maximize _their_ profit and not society&#x27;s well being. That maximization involves dumping down workers wages (another commodity in capitalism). Interestingly enough, workers are also consumers so dumping their wages erodes their purchasing power. And that&#x27;s just one of the contradictions that stem from having a social mode of production driven by private interest.<p>The name of the most prominent economist that pointed out this and other contradictions some decades ago is Marx (which interestingly enough is never mentioned when capitalism crisis are on the table).",1415020825

8550561,comment,8548035,8549669,0,0,pacala,,,"> NO organization is suppose to have market power.<p>This is naive wishful thinking. It&#x27;s popular to create simplistic models to explain basic economic principles, models that assume perfect markets. However, reality does not (have to) comply to such models.<p>Analytically, the principle of economies of scale (1) strongly favors, through market mechanisms, the development of large entities. A large corporation, dividing its marketing and R&D costs over a large market share, has significantly lower costs than upstart small competitors. This enables it to out compete smaller upstarts, and serves as a natural barrier of entry to a specific market. Upstarts are either relegated to a small niche, or, having stumbled upon an entirely new market with no dominant players yet, grow to be a large dominating player in their respective market.<p>Empirically, every single market is dominated by a handful of large actors. This pattern is observed in local markets, national markets and global markets. Quick example for the HN crowd, the cloud hosting market. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Rackspace account for more than half the market share (2). In a young market, with little regulation, where a lot of people on this site have plenty of technological skills to engineer an IAAS service from scratch. But few have the business skill, capital and timing to actually enter the market successfully.<p>(1) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale</a><p>(2) <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-web-services-market-share-2014-6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-web-services-market-sh...</a>",1415019714

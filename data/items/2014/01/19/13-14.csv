First off, Feedly has no way of showing the user the entire article, even if they first direct them to the feedly app.  Feedly should show the preview with a snippet, then provide a &quot;View Website&quot; link.<p>That is, unless you output the entire blog post on your RSS feed.  If you do this, then that&#x27;s your own fault.<p>Therefore we are left with the question.  Does this harm your site and/or metrics?  Short answer. No.<p>Are your users going to your articles from Feedly short links?  Probably not.  Why would you link your users to a feedly short link to begin with?<p>In the end, what Feedly is doing is doing a disservice to their end user.  It makes the process confusing by creating more hoops to get to the original content.

7084323,comment,7081761,7081761,5,0,turbojerry,,,"I&#x27;ll start with the articles bullet points -<p>1.    We can all stipulate: the expert isn’t always right.<p>All humans are fallible, including &quot;experts&quot;, such as Albert Einstein, who famously rejected Quantum Mechanics.<p>2.    But an expert is far more likely to be right than you are. On a question of factual interpretation or evaluation, it shouldn’t engender insecurity or anxiety to think that an expert’s view is likely to be better-informed than yours. (Because, likely, it is.)<p>There are &quot;experts&quot; in things that have no basis in anything other than the expressions of other people which may have no or very limited evidence to support them, priests, Marxist historians, Freudian psychoanalysts etc. Is their &quot;expertise&quot; of any actual value to the rest of humanity? What about &quot;experts&quot; in subjects that we as a species do not have a good understanding of? Does the conflating of those subjects with those that we have much better understanding of, for example conflating public policy with engineering disciplines, help or hinder this discussion?<p>3.    Experts come in many flavors. Education enables it, but practitioners in a field acquire expertise through experience; usually the combination of the two is the mark of a true expert in a field. But if you have neither education nor experience, you might want to consider exactly what it is you’re bringing to the argument.<p>If the &quot;field&quot; is nothing more than some ideology, not backed by evidence, then any &quot;education&quot; in it seems to be open to challenge.<p>&quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.&quot;<p>Upton Sinclair<p>4.    In any discussion, you have a positive obligation to learn at least enough to make the conversation possible. The University of Google doesn’t count. Remember: having a strong opinion about something isn’t the same as knowing something.<p>Do I need to know the 12 Astrological Houses to reject astrology?\nDo I need to know the King James Bible to reject Christianity? \nDo I need to know Mein Kampf to reject Nazism?  \nDo I need to know the Talmud to reject Zionism?<p>5.    And yes, your political opinions have value. Of course they do: you’re a member of a democracy and what you want is as important as what any other voter wants. As a layman, however, your political analysis, has far less value, and probably isn’t — indeed, almost certainly isn’t — as good as you think it is.<p>So if someone wanted to bring about the destruction of humanity, that would be of equal value to someone who does not? Perhaps an Orwell quote would help here-<p>&quot;Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.&quot;<p>Okay, so how about trying to find out what is actually happening? I would posit the following-<p>1. The Internet has allowed the dissemination of both fact and fiction, evidence and opinion.<p>2. Critical thinking, the use of evidence and reasoning seems to be lacking from most educational systems. A population that can be swayed with propaganda rather than evidence and logic is more pliable to the will of the political class and therefore this state of affairs seems unlikely to change.<p>3. The rise of &quot;Truthiness&quot; as a consequence of 2.<p>4. The speed of scientific and technological progress is now so great that expertise in these fields has become much narrower and the ability to communicate this effectively to the non-experts in a timely fashion has gone down.<p>5. The lack of progress in understanding of the complex social, political and economic systems we inhabit while simultaneously an increase in that complexity.<p>6. The increasing perception of many people that the current political, economic and social systems are overly beneficial to an increasingly small number of people and those, like the author of this piece are no more than courtiers to the beneficiaries. As this idea becomes more prevalent, the courtiers must defend themselves and so they try to convince the rest of us that they are experts who have the same precise answers that engineers could give.<p>7. There is no ideological solution to 6.<p>8. People in forums like HN who do have the ability to think critically increasingly critique articles like this and hopefully spur some critical thinking in others, this is then twisted by some, like the author into an attack on all &quot;experts&quot;.",1390137358

7084319,comment,7083777,7083777,8,0,tzs,,,"I took a look at the link they provide on that page to their article on excessive copyright penalties. They provide some examples there to illustrate their points.<p>The first one is a case where they say &quot;A website owner who copied two copyrighted poems, earning no profit and causing no more than minuscule economic harm, was ordered to pay $300,000&quot;.<p>What they don&#x27;t mention is that it was a commercial poetry website, and that its loss was a default judgement because they did not show up to contest the case. The way they describe it will give most readers the impression that it was some little guy being pushed around by Big Poetry.<p>The third one they describe thusly: &quot;Without guidelines, the penalties awarded change radically from case to case. One music industry company that sued three different defendants in separate suits for the same type of infringement won $10,000 per song in one case, $30,000 in another, and $50,000 in a third&quot;.<p>Note that they identify the plaintiff as a &quot;music industry company&quot;, but just call the people being sued &quot;defendants&quot;. Is this because they want to suggest that the defendants are just ordinary music lovers, being unfairly harassed by the music industry?<p>In fact, the defendants were also &quot;music industry companies&quot;. They were record companies who were producing and selling on a large scale commercial recordings of plaintiff&#x27;s compositions. The defendants were either underpaying royalties on compositions that they had licensed, or had failed to obtain licenses. The specifics of the cases differed as to number of works involved, and how many copies were sold of each.<p>Note that statutory damages are per work infringed, not per copy. So, if Alice and Bob separately infringe your copyrighted song, with Alice selling 1000000 copies and Bob selling 1000 copies, then it would be quite reasonable, all else being equal, for statutory damages in your case against Alice to be much much higher per song than statutory damages in your case against Bob--because in both cases there is only song.<p>Also note that courts consider deterrence value when deciding the statutory damages amount. The case against the defendant who got the $50k damages was actually a class action involving several hundred plaintiffs whose songs were being used without compensation by the defendant record company [1]. The case against the defendant who got the $10k was much smaller, with only a handful of songs involved [2].<p>Furthermore, there ARE guidelines for statutory damages. The judges in the above cited cases discuss them and how they arrived at the amounts they did.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.leagle.com/decision/19902241909F2d1332_12019.xml/PEER%20INTERN.%20CORP.%20v.%20PAUSA%20RECORDS,%20INC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leagle.com/decision/19902241909F2d1332_12019.xml/...</a>.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.leagle.com/decision/19951447887FSupp560_11346"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leagle.com/decision/19951447887FSupp560_11346</a>",1390137233

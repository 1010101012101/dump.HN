5155477,comment,5155296,5155296,2,0,johnfuller,,,"If I feel like I'm being inefficient because I'm not meeting my estimates, it's not because of efficiency, it's because I'm really bad at estimating the time a project should take. Just like any other developer out there.<p>There are a lot of articles out there for doing proper time estimation, and they are about as good or bad as all the articles for increasing productivity. That is, there isn't really a good answer for that except for seeing the same thing over and over again and knowing from that experience how long the individual parts should take. Anything I haven't seen before is just going to be a WAG (wild ass guess.)<p>Otherwise, I just have to be honest with myself on how I'm spending my time. Am I getting distracted a lot while working? Am I working solid days? If I need to be working six hour days but I'm routinely getting only 2 hour days of work and 4 hour days of watching cat vids, then I have a different problem.<p>I make sure that I'm getting real work done during my most productive hours. My most productive time is right after I get up, ridiculously early in the morning. If I'm reading hacker news during this time I can literally feel my life force draining from me. If I don't make the most of this time, then I'm losing out for the day.<p>Every developer has an optimum amount of productive hours per day. For me, it's four hours and I begin going downhill after that. Sure, I can spend 12 hours working, but the first four are productive and by the last two I'm a stumbling, bumbling mess, lucky that I can type out my own name. Like sleep, this is different for everyone.<p>Hours worked for me is like the inverse of sleep. If I use up my pool and go into reserves, then I'm that much less productive the next day. I always have to pay back my debt. So, if I'm wrong on my estimates, then working extra hours doesn't help. I just have to be honest with everyone concerned and let them know that the timeline is in trouble and needs to be extended. That's fine, communication and honesty will almost always make up for missed deadlines. Lack of honesty and communication is poison.<p>As a remote worker, I have the luxury of picking my hours. So, I have been slowly doing away with the idea of a weekend. If I feel super productive on a Sunday, then I need to be working. Then, if I feel unmotivated on Tuesday, I can take that day off knowing that I'm still on target for my hours worked and I didn't have to force myself and in doing so, being less productive.<p>A bit issue for me, especially when working on my own, is getting bogged down in an issue. Sometimes it's something that I'm having a hard time figuring out, other times it's me geeking out and trying to over-engineer something. I have trained myself to recognize the symptoms and immediately hit the alarm to have another developer come in and suggest an alternative route.<p>I can blame myself for letting in distractions for news and cat vids, but I have limited control over communication distractions with my team. What I try to do is get an expectation going that I have certain times during which I'm open for communication and which times I'm trying to be a productive developer. It's death for me to be spending a couple of hours in meetings during my most productive hours, much better to make myself available during times when I have already used up my productive time. That way mind numbing meetings help me get ready for naptime. ;)<p>I'm sure I could come up with a lot more, but this is the ""off the top of my head"" stream.",1359790607

With $20 of ingredients and our cooking skills we can whip up a meal that would have cost us most of $100 in a restaurant. There's an app/website where we can control all our grocery coupons from the local supermarket and make our shopping lists, which is fine, but we can't look through our previous purchases that way. I can scan and OCR the receipts easily enough, but that's a waste of my time. So I look through the paper copy, but I'm missing out on some useful longitudinal data.<p>In Europe, by contrast, privacy laws mean you can ask any company to hand over the data they keep on you to peruse it for yourself.

5155459,comment,5154956,5155342,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">It's meaningless to talk about the disproportionality of the maximum sentence when the law is designed to accommodate offences from the trivial to the truly egregious.<p>It isn't designed that way for these offenses, that's the problem. Congress is trying to shove too much under a single offense and then relying on the sentencing guidelines and the courts to separate it out. It shouldn't be possible under a well-drafted law to be guilty of a felony without having done something which is sufficiently egregious to justify a felony penalty.<p>>You think this allows too much discretion to prosecutors and courts, OK, so did a lot of other people at one point, and that's how we wound up with standardized sentencing guidelines and mandatory minimums.<p>Both of those things are not what I am suggesting. The trouble is that maximum sentences for nonviolent crimes are too high and the serious offenses are defined too broadly. Establishing or raising minimum sentences does nothing to help that, if anything it makes it worse.<p>Likewise the sentencing guidelines. The whole concept of ""enhancements"" is rubbish. All crimes with felony penalties should be narrow, well-defined and require intentional malice. The more broadly defined an offense is, the lower the penalties should be. Enhancements are the opposite: They take minor offenses and ratchet them up into severe crimes based on broad and not necessarily even relevant ancillary factors.<p>We rarely if ever see people who get into a bar fight be accused of attempted murder and have to rely on the sentencing guidelines to avoid a life sentence, because murder is narrow and well-defined, and things that are slightly similar to murder but not nearly as severe are not covered. They have their own crimes with correspondingly lower penalties. There is no reason we can't do the same thing with computer crimes, drug crimes, etc.<p>>You don't lose any of your constitutional rights when you accept a plea bargain.<p>You have a constitutional right to, among other things, a jury trial. You cannot both accept a plea bargain and exercise that right -- you can't take the plea offer contingent on the jury finding you guilty.<p>>The reality is that people take them because they don't expect to win in court. The standard of proof in criminal trials is very high, so defense lawyers have little incentive to accept a plea bargain unless the evidence overwhelmingly points to guilt.<p>It makes logical sense to accept a plea bargain in cases where its expected value is better than the expected value of a trial. The issue comes when the outcome of a trial is at all uncertain. If you think you have a 75% chance that the prosecutor will not be able to prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt -- or that your interpretation of the law will be adopted by the judge -- but the expected penalty if you lose is five or more times higher than the plea bargain, you are statistically better off to take the plea notwithstanding that you are likely to win in court. Reduce the delta between expected sentences at trial and plea offers and this stops being the case for the accused who have a fair chance at winning while the accused with no chance of winning will still take the plea.",1359789920

My taiwanese relatives keep every single receipt, and they even ask for my receipts when I go back to visit. At the very least it'll have some sort of positive impact because both the Taiwanese and American economies have a number of similarities, one of which is that both economies have a huge percentage of small business owners, and they are the ones most likely to benefit from tax evasion in the case of a single-rate federal retail sales tax such as the one proposed by FairTax. However, a lottery system would force consumers to demand receipts from these small business owners thus preventing them from doing sales off the books.<p>Also, the grand prize for the lottery is 10M NTD (New Taiwan Dollar), which is ~$337,781 USD, and overall they might pay around $1-2M USD which is a fraction of any estimated potential losses in tax revenue if such a lottery receipt system was not put into effect.<p>Also, our current tax-system is most definitely not holding our economy together, it's pulling it apart. Implementing it into our current tax system might also work too. At the very least, I hope it'll teach Americans to keep their receipts which is a huge improvement in itself.",1359789451

Although this would be a one-time boost, it would be a pretty significant one. A 23% sales tax isn't as awful as all that; the average rate of VAT in Europe is about 20%, <i>on top</i> of income tax.<p>I've been rather skeptical of the fair tax proposals before, but I wasn't aware of the prebate concept which is the old idea of a guaranteed basic income under a new name, and somewhat reflective of the existing incentives. This bears further consideration and I'll spend some time this weekend playing with the numbers. It's interesting to me that it's engineered to be progressive, which a flat tax most certainly is not. I also think the mind-numbing complexity and warped incentives of the existing tax code create a huge drag on the economy. It's monstrously inefficient.",1359789234

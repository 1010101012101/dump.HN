The politicization and militarization of technology is undeniable; at this point, retreating to some new oasis and denying it won&#x27;t make it go away.  While I do want a site where I can see more articles about Erlang and lambda calculus, for now at least, I can accept the pressing need to maintain focus on political issues that undermine our ability to build the technology we want and have it used for good instead of evil.",1372892389

5988033,comment,5987779,5987942,6,0,mjn,,,"It&#x27;s a somewhat common problem faced by recruiters, with different levels of severity and different levels of justification. For example, in the &#x27;90s and early 2000s, MSR recruiters trying to get researchers to jump ship from academia got sometimes combative questions, especially from grad students, relating to Microsoft&#x27;s business practices. In most cases the MSR representative had little ability to respond to those questions, since they had nothing to do with business strategy, and possibly didn&#x27;t even have any particular knowledge of it. About all they could offer was that working at MSR itself was different, and you wouldn&#x27;t be related to the controversy. Nowadays it occasionally comes up with Google recruiters, though not very often thus far.<p>Oddly it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> seem to come up often with recruiters from companies that I would think have considerably more questionable practices. When oil companies and defense contractors recruit in engineering departments, they typically don&#x27;t get much flack. Maybe computer scientists have more of a idealist mindset.",1372892306
5988032,comment,5987779,5987986,8,0,codeulike,,,"Its a good speech. I transcribed it a while back:<p><i>Why shouldn&#x27;t I work for the NSA? That&#x27;s a tough one. But I&#x27;ll take a shot. Say I&#x27;m working at the NSA, and somebody puts a code on my desk, something no one else can break. Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I&#x27;m real happy with myself, &#x27;cuz I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East, and once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels are hiding. Fifteen hundred people that I never met, never had no problem with, get killed. Now the politicians are saying, &quot;Oh, send in the marines to secure the area&quot;, &#x27;cuz they don&#x27;t give a shit. It won&#x27;t be their kid over there, getting shot. Just like it wasn&#x27;t them when their number got called, &#x27;cuz they were pulling a tour in the National Guard. It&#x27;ll be some kid from Southie over there taking shrapnel in the ass. He comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, &#x27;cuz he&#x27;ll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so that we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies used the little skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them but it ain&#x27;t helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. They&#x27;re taking their sweet time bringing the oil back, of course, maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and fuckin&#x27; play slalom with the icebergs, it ain&#x27;t too long till he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddy&#x27;s out of work. He can&#x27;t afford to drive, so he&#x27;s walking to the fuckin&#x27; job interviews, which sucks because the shrapnel in his ass is giving him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he&#x27;s starving &#x27;cuz every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue plate special they&#x27;re serving is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. So what did I think? I&#x27;m holding out for something better. I figure: fuck it, while I&#x27;m at it why not just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? I could be elected President.</i>",1372892277

-----<p>To the extent that revealing an E.O. doesn&#x27;t endanger national security or other legitimate government purposes I agree completely that it should be public.<p>However I don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s safe in general to rely on a given Administration&#x27;s &quot;interpretation of the law&quot;. As Snowden has pointed out, the Administration can change... you should assume that what is permissible under the law and Constitution is actually being done, if that actually worries you.<p>So if the law says that the Government can intercept foreign communications pursuant to a trap-and-trace it&#x27;s probably a good assumption to make that the Government is actually, at some point, trapping aforementioned communications.<p>I mean, if this was working just like a normal law enforcement scheme then you&#x27;d already have to deal with the possibility that the government is tapping a communications channel pursuant to a regular Article III warrant to investigate communications of a terror cell for months at a time. Presumably this wound theoretically still accumulate enough data (and metadata) to theoretically wreck your theoretical world should a theoretical despotism come to pass.<p>What an E.O. should do is to define where an Administration will focus its limited resources in enforcing the law. Perhaps they will decline to fully defend laws that are anti-homosexual in nature. Perhaps they will avoid aggressively going after marijuana usage (would be nice!). But even in that situation, if you cross state lines to buy weed you&#x27;re still technically breaking the law and should be prepared for consequences of that; the E.O. could change tomorrow, after all.<p>And besides all that, what if they guy making an interpretation is at a much lower level. An individual cop might make a snap decision, do you expect them all to mail you a Policy & Vision Statement each month?<p>Even if that did, it would be hopeless to try to push the edge of 1000 different &quot;lawful ways to enforce the law&quot;. Assume anything the law permits might be done.... and even then, it&#x27;s hard enough to fully comply with all the law, even the ones that clearly fall within Constitutional guidelines.",1372891519

5987973,comment,5985435,5987208,14,0,anigbrowl,,,"Along these lines (and without disagreeing with most of the grandparent post), I think it&#x27;s good to look outside US  borders as well as within them.<p>For example, a frequent objection to the government of today is its willingness to engage in drone strikes. It&#x27;s true that these represent a significant change in battle, since US is risking only some flying hardware but no longer a pilot. It&#x27;s also true that whenever we attack someone elsewhere we risk creating a new enemy who wishes to avenge the first target.<p>On the other hand, this has to be viewed in the context of diminishing casualties over time. Drone strikes are far more discriminating than cruise missile attacks, which were the preferred means of retaliation 20-30 years ago; and cruise missile strikes are in turn more discriminating than tactics like carpet bombing of 40-50 years ago. It&#x27;s instructive to compare this with America&#x27;s first outing on the international stage, the Spanish-American war (1895-98), which was rapidly followed by the Philippine-American war (1899-1902), when the  newly-acquired territory of the Philippines promptly rebelled. The latter conflict was truly horrific, with the US engaging in what would be indisputably classed as genocide today. Moral low points of the &#x27;war on terror&#x27; have involved US soldiers photographed in mocking poses with prisoners of war or dead bodies. Back then, veterans were proud to pose atop the massed bones of thousands, in scenes as gruesome as anything from WW2. If you can overlook the messy design and are interested in the history, this is about the most comprehensive resource online: <a href=""http://moviephilippines.blogspot.com/2013/04/documentary-philippine-american-war.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moviephilippines.blogspot.com/2013/04/documentary-phi...</a> ...but given that these events took place over a century ago, books are still a better resource (which was how I learned about it).<p>My point here is not to say there&#x27;s &#x27;nothing to see here,&#x27; but to warn against a kind of historical revisionism that paints the past in idealistic terms as some sort of Eden from which we have since fallen, because appeals to the idea of a noble past to which we must turn back can be leveraged to resurrect injustice as easily as ideals.<p>I <i>strongly</i> recommend looking for the Penguin Classics edition of the <i>Federalist Papers</i>, which contains an outstanding introduction of ~70 pages by historian Isaac Kramnick which delineates the factors and factions that gave birth to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The actual positions of the Federalists and Anti-Federalists still echo through American politics today, and it&#x27;s worth remembering that the (many) opponents of the Constitution considered it a tyrannical imposition on what had up to then been a confederacy of free States. Whether that change in the form of government made Americans more or less free remains a matter of intense dispute.",1372891486

5987902,comment,5984685,5986049,2,0,brodo,,,"Warning, this is a rant.<p>I&#x27;ve started a Meteor.js Project 3 Weeks ago and I&#x27;m regretting it. It&#x27;s an architectural nightmare. It uses global variables for everything. One would think the news, that this is a bad idea, would have spread since the 70&#x27;s. Unit tests are not possible in this style. You can do integration tests with the Laika Framwork though.<p>The next problem is a severe case of &quot;note invented here&quot; syndrome. Packaging, data access, Templating - Meteor.js has it&#x27;s own. For example, they have their own version of Handlebars which I did not realize until yesterday. It has some documented and some undocumented differences to the original one. I had lots of fun with some custom Handlebar helpers that I wrote. I tested them against the original Handlebars and they passed all my unit tests. In the project however they did not work at all.<p>As KaoruAoiShiho said the bindings suck terribly. Well, they don&#x27;t exist really, you just use jQuery. (Thank god, they don&#x27;t roll their own version of that.)<p>The elephant in the room is data access. If you&#x27;re a MongoDB fan like I am they will lure you in with the fact that you can use MongoDB directly form the client. Don&#x27;t fall for that, it&#x27;s a terrible idea. It&#x27;s such a terrible idea, that they introduced &#x27;server methods&#x27; to kind of fix all the problems with it. Server methods are not REST. Server methods are RPC style web APIs. Welcome to 10 years ago. They dislike REST because it&#x27;s stateless. (at least that&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve taken form this talk: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnMqMAYmTuo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnMqMAYmTuo</a>) As you might have realized by now these guys just LOVE state. State and global variables.<p>If you&#x27;re a Haskell programmer and you are not jet curled together into a ball and crying, id&#x27;s suggest to quickly read a monad tutorial before continuing.<p>Dependency management is also a big problem. You can&#x27;t just use nodes good old `require` and `module`. The order in which files are loaded is determined by their name and position in the directory structure. I shit you not.<p>They have also their own build tool. (who would have thought...) It watches your files and compiles them. Which works great most of the time. You can&#x27;t have includes in your SASS/LESS/Stylus files tough. I guess the notion of having a proper module system scares it a little. I found this thing to be the best aspect of my whole Meteor experience. Not as good as Grunt though.<p>Per default, there is no routing. There is an unofficial routing package which works good, but is by far not as feature rich as the Express one. It also introduces some more global variables in true Meteor.js spirit.<p>In my opinion Meteor is good for prototyping. You can get a small app up in no time. Just don&#x27;t build anything real with it.",1372890560

The book is very data driven.  Noam uses the data he collected over the last 10 years to backup the different scenarios he discusses.  Chapter 6 talks about equity split and Noam talks about the difference between 50/50 hand-shake splits, 50/50 designed splits, 51/49 splits, and other splitting scenarios.  I got the audiobook and it&#x27;s an easy listen/read over the weekend.  For me, this is not just a &quot;one man&#x27;s opinion&quot; book.

Gorp[2] is a decent abstraction, but it&#x27;s not nearly as nice as something like DBIx::Class or SQLAlchemy.<p>I find Go more pleasurable to program in than Python, but less pleasurable than Ruby or Perl.

They&#x27;re different things and they&#x27;re complementary.<p>Twitter and Facebook are for posting links to things you&#x27;ve found or broadcasting short messages up to a few sentences. Twitter is for doing those things publicly, Facebook is for doing those things within the circle of your friends.<p>Blogs (and RSS) are for posting longer pieces of text, articles and such things. When you want to post an article, you don&#x27;t put it on Twitter (for obvious reasons) or Facebook (because it limits your audience), you put it on your blog (self-hosted or on a service like Blogger or Wordpress) and you post links to it to Twitter and/or Facebook. And when you want to invite your friends to a movie, you don&#x27;t post that to your blog, you post that on Facebook.<p>So I&#x27;m not worried that Twitter and Facebook don&#x27;t have RSS feeds - I wouldn&#x27;t even want to see my friends&#x27; FB posts when I&#x27;m reading longer articles in my RSS reader. And I&#x27;m not worried about Facebook killing blogs and RSS - yes, most people post stuff on Facebook and not on their blogs, but that&#x27;s because most people don&#x27;t write anything that would resemble an article.<p>(I do agree though that Twitter should have <i>some</i> open API for getting someone&#x27;s public tweets in a machine-readable form, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be RSS, JSON is just fine.)",1372889806

We&#x27;ve been there quite recently.. as someone who did a lot of stupid battle with Bush followers, that stuff is burned into my retina forever.<p>Generally speaking, you guys have people in your country you could use help with, or at least moral support for, instead of being shunned for them. This can be said about any country, but also about the US. So have a nice 4th of July, and <i>enjoy it.</i><p>There is this line from &quot;The Wire&quot; that the character played by Steve Earle says to the heroin junkie: &quot;Sorry Bubs... shame ain&#x27;t worth as much as you think. Let it go.&quot; And he&#x27;s talking about personal shame, not even on behalf of others. If you&#x27;re embarrassed, use that, and shout from the rooftops; but don&#x27;t let it actually get inside you. The ones who should be embarrassed aren&#x27;t, yet the ones who should keep their chins up are feeling down? Nah!",1372888931

Though I guess I don&#x27;t buy things with them a lot.<p>The one time I did buy alien alloy from the store, I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble farming 750 scales from big lizards, though.  I could bring in 30 or 40 scales per trip. I didn&#x27;t time myself, but the trips themselves couldn&#x27;t have been more than a minute or so in duration. It was definitely tedious, but not totally unreasonable.<p>Traps are a poor source by comparison -- 20x to 40x less efficient per time spent.  Admittedly, they&#x27;re passive.  Sort of.",1372888926

The criminals using VPNs to defraud people are also paying for those VPNs with stolen credit cards -- go figure, right? Selling VPNs has a high chargeback risk. It&#x27;s hard to get a merchant account for selling any category of service with a high chargeback risk. They&#x27;re not singling out VPN providers for any other reason.",1372888849

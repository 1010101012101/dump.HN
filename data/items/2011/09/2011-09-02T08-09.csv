2953427,comment,2940974,2952476,1,0,wnight,,,"Did you miss my discussion of the problems of permission-based locking? You dismiss ""using external tools"" when this is a communication issue, not a permission issue.<p>What better achieves the desired results?<p>1) Having many files, only some of which you can save changes to, but working on those files otherwise totally unguided when you can.<p>2) Having many files, all of which you can edit, but only some of which you have been told via email or IM to work on.<p>Obviously (I think) #1 is a joke and #2 is the only practical way to go.<p>> As for using an external tool or process to manage the locking<p>You're thinking of it from the wrong point of view. From the POV of the development manager using gantt charts, using the CVS permissions to convey intent is that horrid external tool.<p>> I don't see how you can state that contention isn't a failure, if people are then to have to redo work!<p>I didn't say that. I said it's not a failure of the VCS. It's a failure of the process that led the people to doing two inherently unmergeable things.<p>As I said in that post, they'd still have done the useless work but they'd simply have saved it under a temp filename after finding out the file was write protected. Then - as you read, I said they'd have to do the painful merge anyways - or watch their work be totally wasted.<p>> These are real people [...] better things to do [...] paymasters have better things [...] than spend time redoing changes that they've already done.<p>Yeah yeah, I get it. But you're missing the point. I'm saying developers waste more time doing this your way, despite the locking.<p>btw, redoing changes they've already done is redundant.<p>> It sort of sounds like you don't think non-programmers would ever have the need to edit a file at the same time as anybody else might be editing it!<p>Not at all. But the non-programmers are less likely to notice the permissions and deduce their ultimate reason and impact and do the right workflow thing.<p>Falling back on the false security of a broken process instead of fixing it is like using broken crypto - you think you're doing well but you'd be better off if someone painfully opened your eyes and realized you were totally insecure all along.",1314953909

This has made it all but impossible to meaningfully compare screens on manufacturer provided stats.<p>Information asymmetry plays a powerful role in marketing, and can result in a race to the bottom where consumers cannot compare things in real terms before purchase, so providers have no incentive to deliver anything of quality (extra costs, no meaningful way to market the extra quality as an option). This sort of behavior is also extremely common in residential ISPs (""unlimited"" internet always sounds better to the average consumer than some kind of published limit).<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Market_fo...</a>",1314953540

I think the cause is that there is a difference in focus:
With books, you can identify the things you already understand ( as-is or as an analogy to something you understand ) and focus on the new stuff, so the more you understand, the better you focus on the new stuff.
The problem is that when you don't understand lots of things well enough, your concentration is not focused, so you end up with a superficial understanding and forgetting a lot as you go.
The solution comes in the form of exercices, which provide an artifial focus, having your full attention until you understand them very well, which is good if you're a beginner, but redundant if you are experienced.",1314953132

Digging into why I have this feeling, the first few thoughts that come to mind include:<p>- Let's say you are offering me a free starbucks, and I have to click 5 adverts to get it. When I walk past a Starbucks do I buy a coffee, or do I think ""that reminds me, I need to click more adverts before I go into Starbucks""? Perhaps even bigger, let's say it's for a graphics card, I decide I want it, but I don't want to buy it until I've seen enough adverts to get that 5% discount I was offered... What if I never see those adverts again? What if I forget about it, or see a different product before I've got there?<p>- I assume your tracking is based on cookies/etc rather than a login, and a huge number of people browse from more than one device, so that would be annoying<p>- Interactive ""get something free"" adverts are generally assumed to be scams, how do you get around the association that people will have between ""get a free iphone"" and ""get a free starbucks coffee""?<p>The concept of engaging users, rather than just shouting at them, isn't new, and it does work, but I'm just not convinced that through banner adverts is the way to do it.<p>From your site, <i>""If youre an advertiser or publisher who is interested in trying out PLAY...""</i> I'm a publisher / work in digital advertising, and while (as you might have guessed) I'm not sold on it, I'd certainly be interested to hear more as you move along.

With a Return on Energy (ROE is like ROI but for energy; how much energy you get vs. how much you need to get it out) of 30 to 1, crude oil essentially still gushes from the ground.<p>After a certain point, even for the same reserve, that ROE drops.  There's still oil, but it's harder to get out.  We'll always have oil, but we won't have it cheaply for much longer.  Converting to an alternative is possible but it will take time and pain.  And that's the sticking point.  America especially relies on a JIT inventory of trucked-in goods, cars to get to work, school, the store, etc.  The switch will be ugly.<p>Piggybacking on that is the long, wonderful period of growth that had us overextend.  The Great Depression also came after a period of over-extension, but back then we had yet to tap our resources and our debt.  We've tapped both out at the start of this depression that's coming.  Add to it the increased demand for resources from China, India and the rest of the world.  We're out.  Bacteria is at its greatest expansion when it hits the edge of the petri dish, and in an instant, it's over.<p>I won't plant a garden or buy a gun -- I don't think it will ever be so bad -- but for a while, during the process of converting to alternate energies and transportation mechanisms, it won't be fun.",1314951351

The USA and its allies (who are, of course, by all their own laws, complicit) have directly killed and caused the deaths of over a million people in Iraq and Afghanistan during the faked hunt for Osama. The vast majority of those were of course absolutely unrelated to the conflict in any way. And of the rest, most were innocent in this context because they didn't support Osama and weren't shooting at us until we started shooting at them.<p>There are a million dead, at least, many of them with holes made by US (and allied) munitions, and you're quibbling about a few who could be threatened, in what has actually been by far the largest and safest (innocents/dictators hurt) release of classified documents EVER.<p>This is serious stuff, stuff worth having posted everywhere, spammed to everyone, SMSing to every phone in the world, etc, on the chance that one copy would get through and let one journalist write one good expose. That it's been managed so as to have a groundbreakingly huge ratio of exposes written to actual data leaked is a stunning testimony to their delicate and thoughtful handling of the media organizations.

I could make comparably healthy foods at home for $4 or so I think<p>The french public highschool was about $4.50. People complained about the food , but I had a little appetizer, main plate, and dessert. And it was usually all &quot;real food&quot;. The kind you could eat forever and be fine. Main plate was usually some meat/fish + a little veggies.<p>In Texas I had a lot of mashed potatoes and chicken nuggets. I have no clue how my body didn&#x27;t completely fall apart . but hey, it was $2.<p>BTW French Uni also had a cafeteria . for about $5 I could have a lunch similar to HS (if a bit more on the greasy side). A lifesaver for a college student too lazy to buy proper food.<p>There are important details (hard to get a lot of good fresh fish in the middle of Nevada), but the school meal thing really is another example of how the US really isn&#x27;t as rich as it likes to portray itself.",1453078768

Once you scratch under the surface, things cease to be easy or stop working at all. It makes you wonder how it&#x27;s been this long and nobody stumbled upon an issue that you uncover 30 minutes into tool&#x27;s use.<p>Docker does have it&#x27;s uses, but in the majority of cases you are better off using native OS package and dependency management (RPM/YUM in the case on Redhat-based distros). One very obvious thing is that package managers usually track versions and dependencies and allow for install actions to happen based on the versions delta. With Docker you just replace the whole environment, which is fine, unless some of the data context is outside of Docker.<p>I think the majority of Docker uses are of a class &quot;I can&#x27;t figure out how to manage dependencies for a given OS, so I am going to skirt the issue by using Docker&quot;.",1453078124

10921886,comment,10917328,10917328,0,0,zappo2938,,,"A few years ago, disillusioned with the fine dinning industry, I walked away from being a chef. Not working in Miami with summer coming, I wrote emails to summer camps with sailing programs trying to get a job as a sailing instructor. Kingly Pines Camp in Maine responded to my email saying, &quot;I won&#x27;t lie to you. We still do need a sailing instructor, but if you are working here you will be cooking.&quot; So I went to Maine for the summer.<p>All the other camps in the lakes region started to outsource their dining to the Aramark corporation. Kingly Pines didn&#x27;t want to go that route. How does an institution like a summer camp provide three meals plus an afternoon snack a day for $5 per person? The camp has average 200 campers under the age of 15 and 100 staff. Also, everybody is very, very physically active so people are hungry. That&#x27;s a food budget of $1500 a day. The decision was to make everything from scratch. There were only three of us in the kitchen<p>The food director who was in charge of the pizza station at U of Maine during the winter was awesome. I appreciate that he listened to me because I was coming from the best restaurants in Northern California. We created a salad bar with 5 different types of homemade salad dressing. We baked our own meats for cold cuts. It&#x27;s not difficult to make home made roast beef and turkey breasts before using a slicer to cut them. The tiramisu caused a riot. Instead of Dinty Moore beef stew, we purchased two top rounds. It&#x27;s one thing to make beef stew with carrots and potatoes but my recipe uses parsnips, celeriac, turnips, and potatoes. Why only make one type of lasagna if you can make three different types? I bet I could get your kids to eat roasted portobello mushroom goat cheese lasagna. Once a week we would make several different facaccia pizzas.<p>The camp&#x27;s philosophy is to challenge children to do things they haven&#x27;t done before whether to get up on water skis for the first time or get to the top of a rock climbing wall, to explore their world, and to learn to be independent. That philosophy was extended to eating too. By the end of every session many the kids even the most reluctant faced with peer pressure to try new things -- it works two ways -- had become gourmands. Turns out that we spent $4.25 a day per person well under budget. The last day of each session when the parents picked up their children we had a big lunch for everybody as the camp did activities that included all the campers and parents for the day. I would say things to the dinning director like buy me four sides of salmon, a couple bags of spinach, and a box of puff pastry. So we were making prime rib and salmon in croute. One of the parents was just amazed and asked if the campers eat like this and his daughter said yes, every day.<p>Children are curious and if they trust the cook to serve them something that isn&#x27;t dull and bland,they are open to the experience of good and interesting food. If someone is serving me canned vegetables and overcooked broccoli that was engineered to have an extended shelf life not for flavor, I&#x27;m not going to want to eat veggies either!<p>If you have kids, have a look at Kingsly Pines camp.

What I&#x27;ve learned as a parent after bringing up four children to at least teen age is that I fare better when I remind my children that they don&#x27;t have to be like someone else, but they will tend to be happier if they work toward better at something tomorrow than their former selves were yesterday. They largely get to decide what to be best at, based on their interests. (Their interests are informed by economic reality of the job market to a much greater degree than mine were at the same age.) In other words, there is no particular reason to fear children thinking &quot;I am not as good as Peter,&quot; if indeed they do not choose to be like Peter.",1453077510

As Taleb has often argued, you dont need to fully understand a problem, all the interaction effects etc., in order to understand that nature has already solved it. Eat what your ancestors ate.<p>2. Could it be that the people who go into food science are basically rejects from more respected disciplines?<p>3. People seem to widely hold beliefs about diet which are patently illogical. For instance everyone seems to talk about how people put on weight because their metabolism slows down, or because it was slow to start with. This doesn&#x27;t make sense. Rate of conversion of food into energy has nothing to do with eating more than your activity level required. Could someone explain this to me?",1453075422

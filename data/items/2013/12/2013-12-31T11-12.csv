Compare e.g. with this one:<p>&quot;These apples are bad because they have been laying in the sun for two days.&quot;<p>There is no reference to anything outside the sentence; &quot;these&quot; and &quot;they&quot; are sort of referring to each other, tying the sentence together.<p>So to me this is the most shocking revelation:<p>> <i>Mr. Graham has since said the “these” referred to women who aren’t programmers. In our opinion, he didn’t say that to us.</i><p>That&#x27;s the equivalent of editing down the above sentence to say,<p>&quot;Apples are bad because they have been laying in the sun for two days.&quot;,<p>and then start claiming that the interviewee is a schizophrenic because he&#x27;s making general claims about all apples. :/",1388491184

While I worked on this, I Googled for transcription software, but couldn&#x27;t find any packages or readily available POSIX pipelines that I could use from Ubuntu, let alone web services that don&#x27;t require a credit card. Maybe I didn&#x27;t look very carefully. Took two days to complete, though. This is something that should be easily doable now, so here&#x27;s my personal RFS: fix transcription software. A user should be able to either upload an audio file directly, use a  Dropbox folder, or provide a link to an s/OGG/MP3/whatever, and get a text file in return.

You will fit right in with the rest of the Glass crowd.<p>So the difference between Glass and a cell phone is that holding a cell phone is more apparent and obvious to people so they can avoid being in my recording? Instead of an invisible Glass, the Glass is visible. I hold my phone in my hand a lot. I usually talk while holding my phone and my hands move a lot. How do you know I am not recording you? How do you know I am not an undercover journalist with a hidden camera in my bag walking around BestBuy? If you actually think that&#x27;s the safe zone to address privacy concern, that is my book definition of trying to feel better when the truth is not.<p>Look at tourists with DSLR in front of their chest or holding it in their hand. How can you tell they are not creeping on you either? I own a DSLR so I know how little people pay attention to it. I can just walk around like that all day.<p>When I say respecting your concern meaning I am going to be your best friend to the best of my ability like remove my headset at your request when we share a tight space. You can&#x27;t guarantee a guy with a cell phone not doing something illegal and horrible to you. So, how can you hold me accountable for something I probably won&#x27;t commit? And now I am asked DON&#x27;T EVER PUT IT ON?<p>The public space is utilized by all kinds of people and for all kinds of purposes. If you feel uncomfortable with me wearing a GLASS in front of you, tell me to remove it and I probably will (e.g I am taking a picture of my family from the GLASS I probably will wait until you go away or find some place else.)<p>And paying my respect does not mean I have to agree with you. As long as it is legal and as long as I am not really hurting you (because I am just a random guy you probably won&#x27;t see me again), I can&#x27;t be stopped for your concern.

At Electromagnetic Wave in London earlier this year, I went to a talk held by someone working on similar research, but using wifi signals. At that time, they didn&#x27;t have the fidelity of this proposed system.<p>Talking to other attendees of EMW, I voiced my scepticism of the need for this over CCTV image analysis. My instinct was that a reasonable CCTV setup would get you 80% of the way towards your goal. I bumped into someone with professional experience at image & video analysis - turns out that the limitations of video are such that this sort of remote monitoring would actually give better quality data than camera feed analysis, at least if you factor in the relative cost of installing adequate enough cameras.<p>The biggest use for a system like this probably isn&#x27;t gaming, home automation, or remote monitoring. Imagine instead knowing not where people are in a shop, but roughly what they are looking at, how they are each moving, tracking it all the way through to what they buy. Whilst there are lots of exciting security uses for systems like this, shopping analytics is where there are clear financial gains to be made (remember that investments to reduce costs typically look for >20% savings, but when increasing revenue 2% can be a lot!)<p>Of course, the big question here is range, and how many simultaneous targets this can track.<p>(and as a final note: now shrink this and give me my motion sensor alá Aliens ;) )",1388490903

6990045,comment,6986469,6986550,1,0,jcape,,,"The phrase to describe this view is &quot;false dichotomy&quot;: the answer is either someone sticks their fingers in my pants or taxis are allowed to drop people off at the stairs to the plane, 1950s style. There are shades of gray, and complaints about the TSA tend to take the form of &quot;you are nearly black to no effect.&quot; I should also note that your language about &quot;if the TSA is an effective means of instituting these safety precautions&quot; is pure question begging. As though the only way to ensure security of travellers is  to (effectively) strip search them all, but maybe if the TSA had an IG they would get around to deciding that nail clippers are not a problem sooner. Or perhaps the Bureau of Prisons would be better trained to handle airport security.<p>Regarding proposing solutions, Bruce Schneier, who was describing TSA efforts as &quot;security theater&quot; at least 5 years ago, is perhaps among the most famous: he&#x27;s been on 60 Minutes over the issue, publicly debated the former head of the TSA, and testified before Congress as to what measures real security would entail. Just last week there was a humorously worded rant about the TSA&#x27;s stunning lack of competence by the former head of Israeli airport security, Rafi Sela.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the biggest objectively measurable improvement to travellers&#x27; security is the change in attitude of travellers themselves. The belief of passengers that they will be flown to Cuba and a release negotiated was dispelled even before 9/11 was over.

I use a slightly different means to achieve it though, I use Active Inbox (<a href""http://activeinboxhq.co"" rel""nofollo"">http://activeinboxhq.com</a>) which is a plugin for Gmail. It helps with GTD stuff by giving &quot;Statuses&quot; such as Action, Waiting On and Some Day to messages (they&#x27;re just labels underneath but it gives them a nice UI) and I use it to display my actioned messages next to my inbox via a feature called Radar.<p>That&#x27;s all well and good but so far it&#x27;s only what the author has done (but with, IMHO, a nicer and easier to use UI). What Active Inbox does that isn&#x27;t possible without a plugin is it adds notes and &quot;next steps&quot; to emails, it&#x27;s easiest to explain with a screenshot:<p><a href""http://awesomescreenshot.com/08225ii5e"" rel""nofollo"">http://awesomescreenshot.com/08225ii5e9</a><p>Full disclaimer: I have been paid to add features to Active Inbox (including some of the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned and very cool upcoming keyboard control thingy) but I was a happy customer before that happened.",1388489773

Since we&#x27;re dealing with World Wide Web, it can&#x27;t be that you would have to install the public key of <i>every</i> site that you visit to get signed versions of the code – it would make browsing infeasible.<p>It just boils down to the CA based system that is already employed by HTTPS. You must of course trust the other party and their systems, but that&#x27;s the exact same with code signing. To identify the other party, code signing uses a pre-shared secret (e.g. your OS comes pre-installed with their public key). In HTTPS you identify the other party by them possessing the right certificate, that&#x27;s signed by a trusted intermediary. There&#x27;s no really better way to do it, bar quantum crypto and HTTPS+DNSSEC, which is sadly not widely supported.",1388489718

But I love the weather, the walkability of the gaslamp district and just a whole lot of things. I have never lived in a large city before and disliked most of the ones I have been in. I have toyed with the idea of doing a kickstarter project related to the city (and county?) of San Diego.<p>I have looked around and asked around a smidgeon for online resources related to San Diego. I am getting the impression there isn't all that much, at least not anything really good. I wondered if people would be interested in having something better. I am still toying with the idea. At one time, I wanted to go into urban planning or something related. Urban planners tend to be career bureaucrats, many working for government. That is not my comfort zone. Before life interrupted my career plans, I was increasingly wondering what that ""something related"" part might be.

4172590,comment,4171520,4172144,1,0,kokey,,,"I find the dynamics of the expectation of countries having to bail other countries in the Eurozone out quite interesting.  Normally, inside a nation, say France, you have wealth distribution since politicians and the public can, through taxes, take money from the rich people in order to help the poor.  This works where the notion exist that it's fair, because the rich are rich because of luck or power, or whatever.  Now it gets interesting where you get the same dynamic in the Eurozone, where the countries that can't manage their economy well because of their bad policies, corruption, incompetence, etc. want countries that do manage their economy better to bail them out.  It gets extra interesting, since Germany is a country where wealth is not something that was created because of imperial conquest or the likes, or because of abundant natural resources.  They lost a war, and half of it was even under communist rule until two decades ago.  They achieved their wealth, and Merkel in particular don't see having to pay guilt tax on that achievement as making any sense.",1340902466

I don't think I've seen a mention of trigger.io yet that doesn't grossly misrepresent phonegap as being some difficult, arcane, ""only greybeards can use it"" monstrosity.<p>>I decided to go with Trigger.io to achieve my goal, as I wanted to spare myself endless hours spent on configuring environment (as opposed to PhoneGap/Appcelerator)<p>Huh?  Have you tried phonegap?  How does ""click next on a couple of installers and extract a single zip file"" take hours of configuration?<p>>Trigger.io provides you with a pleasant environment, where you dont have to touch command line at all! It works as an app within your browser, from localhost. I do understand that a lot of folks may prefer hacker-style black terminal over Triggers clean and minimalistic web app, but for me clicking a button that i can see instead of typing a command is a much better experience, especially at the beginning.<p>I can't figure out what on earth he is trying to compare it to here.  What html/js mobile app framework involves typing commands in ""hacker style black terminals""?

4172572,comment,4170531,4171221,1,0,hollerith,,,"Although I agree with your overall point that the early Web is essentially a creation of the government (and of individual programmers) and not of the free market, I disagree that CERN had anything important to do with the Web.<p>The extent of CERN's sponsorship of the development of the Web was that Tim Berners-Lee obtained permission from his boss to work on it during work hours. His boss's main reason for giving the permission was that he wanted CERN to start evaluating NeXT, Inc, as one of CERN's suppliers, and development of this Web thing seemed just as good a test of NeXT's marketing claims about the excellence of its development environment as anything else.<p>Probably the biggest way that CERN helped was by providing a good living for a relatively large population of potential early adopters of the Web. (Before the ""discovery"" of the internet by the mainstream media in 1993, adoption of the internet was almost completely by very-high-IQ folks.)<p>ADDED. The much more important point, though, is the fact that when Tim BL started developing the Web, the Internet was a very fertile and welcoming environment for experimentation. If you are on Linux or Mac, take a look at /etc/services and realize each of the port numbers you see listed in that file is an experiment. (Note that most of the least successful experiments might not have made it into that file.)  I tend to agree with those who say that if Tim BL hadn't invented the Web, it would not have taken long for someone else to invent something similar (something that allows owners of web sites to create experience on graphical UIs that are more compelling that the plain text that was dominant on the Internet till then).<p>In discussions like this about which individuals and organizations caused an important technological development, it is important to keep in mind one's reasons for wanting to know.  My reason for wanting to know how much of the Web and the Internet was caused by government is that it helps me decide how likely government-employed or government-funded individuals are to contribute to <i>future</i> important innovations.",1340902287

Part of the problem is that the immense complexity involved in living organisms is unpredictable, even with today's computing technology.<p>Human-engineered circuits are easy to predict; they were designed in a way that made the most sense.  With biology however, something that appears to be working may have a completely unrelated side effect that isn't noticed until decades later, or even something so bizarre that it isn't noticed until hundreds of years later in future generations.<p>The way we currently find treatments (grossly oversimplifying) is to grab some substance that looks like it might work, test it in animals, test it in humans, wait a while to make sure nothing really bad happened, and then prescribe it as a drug.<p>If computers get advanced enough, I would much prefer the case where all of these interactions are fully simulated.  You can go through millions of variations of substances all while tracking every change they make to each part of the virtual organism.  Obviously, this is a VERY long way off, but it would be nice because we wouldn't have to worry about unknown side effects.<p>Of course, our current way is the best we've got, and it saves millions of lives each year, so while there may be some future risk, we're doing the best we can.<p>*On a somewhat related note, I've always thought it would be cool to have programmable blood filters.  In other words, you could essentially provide the type of molecule or cell you are looking to trap, and then something like a ccd would either redirect it or let it pass through.",1340901922

In particular the first law, which tells us that energy is conserved, so if a system takes in more energy than it expends, the energy contained in the system has to increase. If that system happens to be our fat tissue, than the fat tissue accumulates fat. Thats the logic. So if we eat more than we expend, we get fatter and the logic turns this around to say that we get fat because we eat more than we expend. And so, overeating and sedentary behavior are the causes. This is the logic that leads virtually every government health agency and independent health organization (the AHA, the AMA, you name it) to have some variation of this World Health Organization statement on its website or in its promotional material: The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance between calories consumed on one hand, and calories expended on the other hand.</i>",1340901559

It is indeed very similar to what I'm proposing, and it's sad to see that it didn't take the first time around.<p>I think it's worth trying again, perhaps under a new moniker, and with some changes. One big change is option #2 - no device or carrier modifications. That means that the onus really isn't on the manufacturer to support an upgrade, other than getting the initial certification. After that step is taken, they have Google's assurance that future updates will run on the device.<p>Another potential change would be for Google to spend some marketing dollars on the initiative.<p>Finally, Google could make certification a required part of the Android licensing process. It becomes a non-voluntary program. The drawback to this, of course, is that it raises the bar on all Android phones, probably reducing the cheapest options to close to zero. (Although, who knows?

And in any event, the major influence on how efficiently code runs is the underlying CPU, not C. C is the same, no matter which CPU it's going to be compiled for; the resulting code, which is what actually gets run, will vary. `p[i]', where `int p[100]' is a global, is going to turn into something quite different when built for MIPS from what it would for x86.<p>So what good is learning C?

But the standard library is written mostly in C and calls into an OS that is written mostly in C.  So C's computational model can indeed explain how low-level things work.<p>The C standard even defines a ""freestanding implementation,"" which is a C platform that has no access to an OS.  So C-the-language can work without any OS at all, and without any runtime/interpreter that is filling the role of a traditional OS.

That would have had a decent chance of forcing us toward a real national healthcare system.<p>Consider the lesson of Washington State: <a href=""http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2017852301_insurancemandate28m.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2017852301_i...</a><p>In 1993, Washington passed a law that guaranteed access to health insurance, and required all residents to purchase insurance. Two years later, the Republicans gained control and set about repealing this.<p>However, much of the law was extremely popular, such as the parts guaranteeing affordable access. The Republicans let those stand, but went ahead and repealed the mandate.<p>Result: people dropped insurance until they got sick, then bought it, then dropped it when they were better. Insurance companies started losing a lot of money.<p>That led insurance companies to pull out of the market, and it became virtually impossible as an individual to buy health insurance in Washington at any price.<p>Around 2000, the law was changed again, allowing insurance companies to make people with preexisting conditions wait nine months before coverage starts, and allowing them to reject the sickest applicants. The state created a state run high risk pool to cover those people.<p>Imagine if something like this happened nationally. The individual mandate goes, but the rest remains.<p>I think a similar thing would happen nationally. Polls show that when people are asked about the various major provisions of the Affordable Care Act (but are not told that they are being asked about that Act, so that they aren't prejudiced by the ridiculous claims the Tea Party spread about it, such as the ""death panel"" fantasy) they are overwhelming in favor of everything except the mandate.<p>No way would the Republicans be able to get repeal of those through without committing political suicide with the voters. That would leave us with the Washington situation--the insurance companies bearing increased costs, without the mandate to ensure that enough healthy people are paying premiums to cover this. We'd get a health care crisis similar to what happened in Washington.<p>Congress would HAVE to act, and I think the outcome would be some sort of true national health care system, with a mix of private and government provided services, open to everyone.",1340900440

4172334,comment,4163820,4168921,1,0,flyinRyan,,,"Well, I'm glad you're at least reasonable about the employees rights (many people aren't!) but the issue is (as I referred to in another post): the agency you hire to help you find talent is in a field that can only make money with high volumes.  What you and the article author are taking personal isn't.  The agencies aren't going ""muhahahaha!  Now that we've placed Rockstar 275 at robomartin's company let's poach them!"".  They simply have the person they found for you in a database and when ever they get a new job or haven't filled an existing one within a certain amount of time they're going to connect with everyone that their DB report says matches the profile.<p>They don't know and they don't care who they've placed where (at least the part of the company that sends out these ""poach"" emails doesn't).  A new employee isn't going to jump ship within a month of getting a new job unless a) they really hate the new job or b) the new offer blows them away to the point of being willing to burn bridges.<p>I suppose agencies could put some kind of filter in their DB to not let people under no-poaches show up in the results, but why bother?  Every company probably has a different no-poach period and all kinds of bothersome clauses they want and it nearly never comes up anyway so it's not worth the effort to deal with the issue.  It easier to worry about these things on an exception basis, e.g. employee answers back with interest.  At this point we can check if there is any reason we shouldn't go forward.  But they will be sending out so many emails, most of which will be ignored, there's just no point thinking about it until someone actually answers.<p>This is simply a classic case of assuming there is malice where in truth there is just laziness.",1340899483

Instead of empowering its users its become yet another mechanism for marketing. Sure, the rising tide has lifted all boats, its users have become more empowered.

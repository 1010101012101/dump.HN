Your viewcontrollers are likely already bloated without inline UI implementations.<p>It really comes down to personal preference especially on smaller projects/apps, but I'd argue if you have ever worked on a large scale app that you are <i>responsible</i> for maintaining and enhancing long term, your opinion of NIB dependencies will change. This is especially true as your team pushes the limits of the UI and app performance. If I was going to teach you how to write an app, I'd explain what NIBs are (known pros and cons) and let you decide for yourself.

There's some very careful stuff, and a lot of data-dredging on datasets of convenience (or over-extrapolation from limited data sets).<p>More traditional poli-sci is scientific in the sense of the social sciences, which has a fairly long history of epistemological debate I'm only vaguely familiar with. I think I would probably call it scientific in a certain sense, but maybe a different word is needed. I'd group it vaguely with disciplines like anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics as areas with quite a bit of methodological diversity, but still a more empirical orientation than you find in the humanities. Part of the issue is that there is data, but how to interpret the data is complex (""there is no such thing as raw data"").

So Visual Studio adds the delegates/wiring necessary for the control to fire properly when clicked on.<p>Unfortunately this is where Interface Builder gets crazy and confusing. Double-clicking a Button control in Interface Builder does not do this for you;  Instead you have to use Actions for something like a click event and Outlets if you wanted to wire up a Label and then be able to programmatically change it from code-behind. You'll actually need to drag a special Outlet or Action connector in Interface Builder to make that crucial relation between Interface Builder and Xcode.<p>So while Interface Builder serves a very similar purpose to Visual Studios UI builder there is a pretty significant disconnect between it and the code-behind that makes it much less intuitive to use.",1366137999

5559958,comment,5554600,5555830,2,0,Chris_Newton,,,"FWIW, here are a few things about automated testing that Ive found to be true very generally.<p>Other things being equal, testing is good and automated testing is more valuable than manual testing, for the same reasons that having any systematic, repeatable process is generally more efficient and reliable than doing the same things manually and hoping to avoid human error. Many of the following notes are just reasons why other things arent always equal and sometimes you might prefer other priorities.<p>Automated test suites get diminishing returns beyond a certain point. Even having a few tests to make sure things arent completely broken when you make a change can be a great time-saver. On the other hand, writing lots of detailed tests for lots of edge cases takes a lot of time and only helps if you break those specific cases. For most projects, a middle ground will be better than an extreme. But remember that as a practical reality, an absurdly high proportion of bugs are introduced in those quick one-line changes in simple functions that couldnt possibly go wrong, so sometimes testing even simple things in key parts of the code can be worthwhile.<p>Automated test suites have an opportunity cost. Time you spend writing and maintaining tests is time youre not spending performing code reviews, or formally proving that a key algorithm does what you think it does, or conducting usability tests, or taking another pass over a requirements spec to make sure its self-consistent and really does describe what you want to build. These things can all help to develop better software, too.<p>Automated test suites do not have to be automated <i>unit</i> test suites. For example, higher-level functional or integration tests can be very useful, and for some projects may offer better value than trying to maintain a comprehensive unit test suite.<p>Unit tests tend to work best with pure code that has no side effects. As soon as you have any kind of external dependency, and you start talking about faking a database or file access or network stack or whatever other form of I/O, unit testing tends to become messy and <i>much</i> more expensive, and often youre not even testing the same set-up that will run for real any more.<p>A corollary to the above is that separating code that deals with external interactions from code that deals with any serious internal logic is often a good idea. Different testing strategies might be best for the different parts of the system. (IME, this kind of separation of concerns is also helpful for many other reasons when youre designing software, but those are off-topic here.)<p>Modifying your software design just to support unit tests can have serious consequences and can harm other valuable testing/quality activities. For example, mechanics that you introduce just to support unit testing might make language-level tools for encapsulation and modular design less effective, or might split up related code into different places so code reviews are more difficult or time-consuming.<p>Automated testing is there to make sure your code is working properly. It is not a substitute for having robust specifications, writing useful documentation, thinking about the design of your system, or, most importantly of all, understanding the problem youre trying to solve and how youre trying to solve it.<p>No-one really only writes code that is necessary to pass their tests. Even if they religiously adhere to writing tests first, at some point they generalise the underlying code because thats what makes it useful, and the test suite didnt drive that generalisation or verify that it was correct. In TDD terms, the tests only drive the red/green part, not the refactor part.<p>For similar reasons, just because someone has a test suite, that does not mean they can safely refactor at will without thinking. This may be the most dangerous illusion in all of TDD advocacy, but unfortunately it seems to be a widespread belief.<p>A lot of evidence cited in support of various test strategies and wider development processes is fundamentally flawed. Read critically, and be sceptical of conclusions that over-generalise.<p>And finally, what works for someone elses project might not be a good choice for yours, and something that didnt fit for someone else might still be useful for you. If youre experimenting, it can be very informative just to keep even basic records of roughly how much time youre really spending on different activities and what is really happening with interesting things like speed of adding new features or how many bugs are getting reported in released code. Youre allowed to change your mind and try a different approach if whatever youre doing right now isnt paying off.",1366137649

The only thing we do is gracefully disable some premium functionality and restrict editing (not viewing) to projects created in the premium period.<p>- All the users who signed up before got to keep their projects and the editing capabilities. Some of them have more than 150 huge projects.<p>- On top of this, we are giving non profit and educational organizations as well as open source teams free premium plans.<p>- We rarely say no to users asking for discounts or extended trials if they can't afford the premium plans.<p>Our most important goal for us is to create a business we can grow so we can bring more value for our users - we really have a ton of great features in the pipeline that we're excited about.<p>Time will tell whether we've made the right steps or if we have to make certain adjustments to our business.<p>Thanks again!<p>Edit: line breaks",1366137639

When you log into 4 square and check in at a location, that's a real time transaction.<p>But there is also software that uses occasional location lookups, or data from other applications that use such lookups, and it's not necessarily in real time, and it does so in ways aren't necessarily user initated. It's data which can be gps but also wifi or even cell phone tower based, or even from other apps like navigation software) to do things like figure out generally where you are, give you dining suggestions, tell you about local events etc.  When your weather app updates with the local weather, it's probably on some schedule, but it does a gps lookup every few hours.  Same thing.<p>When Google Now figures out where you live and where you work using an occasional gps lookup/results from your google maps searches, etc, it's not a real time thing, but it is using location. I believe the iphone lets you set location based reminders.  That's also location aware.<p>It's also rich interesting data.  And since it isn't always on, it doesn't drain your battery.<p>Now either google, or someone with such data, is going to build an app that lets you opt in to sharing information about your general location, combined with data on your interests, to do some really cool things.<p>Also, It's not something I know too much about, but I understand that there are a lot of location based gay dating/hookup apps that are doing well.

As they continued the development process, theyd notice that more and more of their views had to be done in code because Interface Builder wasn't powerful enough to do what they wanted. It could then be understandable why for newer projects, someone would skip Interface Builder altogether and go for code-only from the start.<p>Things have changed now though. Auto-Layout is extremely powerful in both Interface Builder and through code. Out of the box your visually designed interfaces now support powerful alignment and resizing irregardless of screen size. This is a big deal because there are a lot of screen sizes in iOS these days (iphone4, iphone5, ipad, all of these in landscape and portrait and yet again all these permutations with and without the keyboard open). auto-layout makes internationalization super easy too as all objects on your interface are designed to get bigger as words get longer (such as in German), yet have all associated objects around them still be perfectly aligned. Even right-to-left languages (and interface re-ordering) is supported without any additional code.<p>Looking at the code in the article, none of these are supported. If you even turn your iphone landscape the ui will be cut off. Let alone supporting ipad, keyboard open, longer words in the buttons/labels, etc.<p>I highly recommend new iOS developers to start with Auto-Layout from the getgo: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserE...</a><p>It's like tables vs css.

5559762,comment,5550930,5554049,2,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"Thanks for checking Julia out. I fear there is a fair amount of misinformation in your comment, however, so it seems that a few things were lost in your reading of Julia's code (some of which is admittedly quite tricky). I hope you don't mind if I address some of it.<p>The first point is that Julia already has excellent performance on a par with most compiled languages, including, e.g. Haskell, whether they are using LLVM or not. Straight-forward Julia code is typically within a factor of two of C. That's shown in the microbenchmarks on Julia's web site [<a href=""http://julialang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org/</a>], but, of course, that's not entirely convincing because, you know, they're microbenchmarks and we wrote them. However, similar performance is consistently found in real-world applications by other people. You don't have to take my word for it here's what Tim Holy [<a href=""http://holylab.wustl.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://holylab.wustl.edu</a>] has to say: \n<a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/julia-users/eQTYBxTnVEs/LDAvW748secJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/julia-users/eQTYBxTnVEs/LDAv...</a>. Iain Dunning and Miles Lubin also found it to be well within a factor of 2 of highly optimized C++ code when implementing realistic linear programming codes in pure Julia: <a href=""https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-tutorial/blob/master/NumericalOptimization/presentation.pdf?raw=true"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-tutorial/blob/master/Nume...</a>. The benchmarks appear on page 7 of their presentation.<p>This statement about Julia's high-level optimizations is entirely wrong:<p>> i've looked at how it compiles to llvm, and it basically punts any optimization to the llvm side, aside from the most basic tracing jit method monomorphization/specialization.<p>Julia does no tracing at all, so it's definitely not a tracing JIT. A relatively small (but growing) very crucial amount of high-level optimization is performed on the Julia AST before generating LLVM code. In particular a dynamic dataflow-based type inference pass is done on the Julia AST. Since Julia is homoiconic, this type inference pass can be implemented in Julia itself, which may be why you missed it: <a href=""https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/inference.jl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/inferenc...</a>. Don't be fooled by the briefness of the code  Jeff's dynamic type inference algorithm is one of the most sophisticated to be found anywhere; see <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.5145v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.5145v1.pdf</a> for a more extensive explanation. It's also highly effective: 60% of the time it determines the exact type of an expression and most of the expressions which cannot be concretely typed are not performance critical [see section 5.2 of the same paper]. You are correct that we leave machine code generation to LLVM  after all, that's what it's for  but without all that type information, there's no way we could coax LLVM into generating good machine code. Other very important optimization passes done on the Julia AST include aggressive method inlining and elimination of tuple allocation.<p>> more succintly, Julia lacks a clear enough thoughtful choice in static/dynamic semantics for the pre LLVM side to have an easy optimization story given a small sized core team, such optimization engineering will either take a long time to develop, or will require some commercial entity to sink serious capital into writing a good JIT / optimizer.<p>There is a very clear and thoughtful choice in static vs. dynamic semantics in Julia: all semantics are dynamic; there are no static semantics at all. If you think about your code executing fully dynamically, that is exactly how it will behave. Of course, to get good performance, the system figures out when your code is actually quite static, but you never have to think about the distinction. And again, Julia already has excellent performance, and we have accomplished that with an admittedly tiny and relatively poorly funded team. (All the money in the world won't buy you another Jeff Bezanson.)<p>> also: Julia doesn't have a type system, it has a dynamic check system. (Show me the code for static type check in the julia code base as it exists on github and I'll owe you a beer :) )<p>The academic programming language community has gradually narrowed their notion of what a type is over the past decades to the point where a type system can only be something used for static type checking. Meanwhile, the real world has gone full throttle in the other direction: fully dynamic languages have become hugely popular. So yes, if you're a programming language theorist, you may want to insist that Julia has a ""tag system"" rather than a ""type system"" and other type theorists will nod their heads in agreement. However, the rest of the world calls the classes of representations for values in dynamic language like Python ""types"" and understands that a system for talking about those types checked or not  qualifies as a type system. So, while you are correct that Julia doesn't do any static type checking, it is still understood to have what most people call a ""type system"".<p>[There's actually an important point of programming language philosophy here: one of the premises of Julia is that static type checking isn't actually the main benefit that's brought to the table by a type system. Rather, we leverage it for greater expressiveness and performance, leaving type checking on the table  for now. This emphasis doesn't mean that we can't add some type checking later since we can infer exact types 60% of the time, we can check that those situations don't lead to errors. We can also provide feedback to the programmer about places where they could improve the ""staticness"" of their code and get better performance or better ""checkability"". This let's the programmer use a dynamic style for prototyping and gradually make their program more and more static as it needs to be faster and/or more reliable.]<p>> Let me repeat: Julia doesn't have clear static semantics / phase distinction, and doesn't really seem to do anything beyond method specialization before passing code on to LLVM. This means it can't get compelling performance compared with any other LLVM backed language.<p>I'll repeat myself a bit too. Julia has a very clear static semantics there are none. The run-time does quite a bit of analysis and optimization after method specialization (aggressive run-time method specialization is incredibly important, however, so one shouldn't discount it). And, of course, Julia already has compelling performance compared with other languages, both static and dynamic, in benchmarks and real-world applications.",1366135835

I probably don't know what I'm talking about, but these were my thoughts at the time:<p>Wishlist  A Method to Pre-Approve and Track Credit Card Transactions<p>The issue:<p>A business using a credit card doing business with a relatively small number of vendors wanting to first avoid credit card fraud (stolen numbers) and secondly wanting to easily track down the offending business.<p>The idea:<p>The business would like to approve particular vendors to use the credit card with number 0000-0000-0000-0000 with each individual business pre-approved to run the transaction with a 5th set of identifiable numbers, so something like 0000-0000-0000-0000-0001.<p>If the credit card is used to make a fraudulent transaction, then ideally, they would have had to have used the 5th set of identifying numbers. This 5th set of identifiable numbers would then allow for easy tracking of the offending vendor, which would allow the  business to either re-think doing business with them, or to serve as a starting point discuss security issues with the vendors credit card transaction processes.<p>Summary:<p>Basically, I believe there may be a need for a new or value added credit card type service. This transaction type would require a 5th set of numbers which have been assigned to pre-approved vendors. This 5 number set (ie. 0000-0000-0000-0000-0002) credit card transaction would most likely prevent theft right off (because the vendor is pre-approved and should provide their own private key (ie. CCV) to put through the transaction). Secondly, if and when the credit card number is stolen and used to make a fraudulent purchase, then, at least with the 5th number set a vendor can be identified and security policy with them can be re-evaluated.<p><a href=""http://www.redbridgenet.com/blogging/wishlist-a-method-to-pre-approve-and-track-credit-card-transactions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redbridgenet.com/blogging/wishlist-a-method-to-pr...</a>",1366135296

The only downsides are that you have limited storage and bandwidth, and that you can't use a custom domain name for you website (so your URL will always be xxxx.azurewebsites.net).

Certainly you will find layouts that cannot be achieved idiomatically in CSS, just as certain software patterns are more idiomatic in one OO language than another (e.g. observer pattern in C# vs Java). But the more scenarios you attempt to address with the language, the more complex it becomes. It's quite possible that extensions to CSS would open it further to the criticism that it's too complex.<p>Unfortunately, browser vendors do not support any other stylesheet language. Perhaps if this were different, there would be more effort to understand stylesheets from an engineering perspective. Since it's not, we're stuck with poorly-thought conventions and a community that's been trained to despise the language.<p>CSS is not a happy language, that much I'll agree with. But I find it no more painful than other computer languages. I reassert the lack of rigorous analysis by CSS users and the collective community as the main solvable problem. I have worked at extremely pricey consultancies, and the only thing I learned about CSS from them is that the more senior of a developer you are, the less respect you have toward CSS as an engineerable technology.",1358351747

There are already implementations of this, for example SELinux.<p>It difficulties in that how do I know which files a particular program might need and how is this implemented at a UI level?\nFor example, what if a program asks for permissions on PNG files? Is this because it wants to manipulate them or is it simply that some of it's internal assets are stored as PNGs?\nWhat happens if I add a plugin or update to a program that allows it to work with different file types? How do you prevent ""dick moves"" like a new program locking other programs out of a file type it decides to claim?<p>How do you implement the UI? Is it some central permissions manager or do you have endless popups (which people are likely to just unthinkingly click accept on)?",1358348599

If you get to the stage that you're experiencing extreme apathy or dark thoughts then definitely call a help line and get some free counseling.<p>Assuming that you're not depressed but just in a rut here are some things that work for me but your mileage may vary:<p>- go outside. Go for a walk or a hike in nature.<p>- invite friends over and cook them dinner. While youre cooking as them about their lives and how they are going. Be interested in how they really are. Once you do that, communication will start flowing.<p>- block your work up. You could try the Pomodoro technique etc. take blocks of time to relax too.<p>- get some exercise.<p>- ask your parents about what it was like growing up for them. You may get a deeper understanding of why they are restrictive.<p>- get your friend to set you up on a blind date.<p>- write a page of free form stream of conscious every morning for a week. First thing when you get up. At the end of the week read them.<p>Good luck buddy",1358348551

5067052,comment,5066704,5066704,2,0,dutchrapley,,,"It depends on context. If you have never built a web application, it can be very difficult task grasping what exactly Rails does for you (even it your are experienced in programming languages). For someone who has been building web applications for years, the it may be easier for that person to understand the pain points that Rails solves. Since Rails is domain specific to web development, you're not necessarily learning programming, but really how to apply programming to web development based on the framework's conventions. The bottom line is that you're learning something new. How hard the learning is depends on the foundation you're currently have that you can build upon. Having a foundation in a programming language doesn't necessarily mean that you're poised get up and running quickly with a web framework if you've never done web development.<p>The art of building web applications today, in itself, is much more complex than it was 10 years ago - mostly due to the every growing selection of tools that make it easier for experienced developers to build web applications. This in turn can make web development seem daunting.<p>Personally, when I started learning Rails, I had a foundation of working with rudimentary frameworks in other languages. When I discovered Rails, it did quiet a bit of what those other frameworks accomplished and then some. Then it took it further and pushed the envelope (i.e. REST support for urls and routing, more recently including CoffeeScript and the Asset Pipeline).<p>While there's a ton of learning resources out there for learning Rails, it can be really hard to put them together and figure out what in what order you need to learn new concepts.<p>That being said, I think The Flatiron School did an excellent job getting together a list of learning resources: <a href=""http://prework.flatironschool.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prework.flatironschool.com/</a> - Just a heads up that it recommends CodeSchool and Tree house which are subscription services. If you're serious about learning, I'd consider the subscription cost to be a small investment.<p>The one resource that Flatiron Prework didn't mention is the Rails Tuturial: <a href=""http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book</a><p>If you really want to dive into ruby, I'd recommend The Well Ground Rubyist by David Black.",1358348456

Every day you have several dozen, if not hundreds or more ""requests"" made of your office. Fix this. Change that. Ban it too!<p>It all just blurs together. Eventually you need to filter the noise, ""these quacks are all just in it for themselves. I represent the people, I need to know what the people want!"" you may say to yourself. How can you tell what the people want. Well, get them to rally together, show that there is support for the clause to ""Ban it!""<p>How could we do that? Perhaps by getting everyone interested to express said interest. What's the threshold of people you're willing to listen to though? 25,000? That seems right. But suddenly, every cause can rally 25,000 people without issue, we're back to the initial issue: too much signal:noise. So we increase the threshold; only the issues that people <i>really</i> care about will make it through.<p>----<p>I never actually believed the petitions were doing much good.

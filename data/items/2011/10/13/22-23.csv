So C is not a bad language; there are just a lot of bad programmers around using it.<p>(And if you're wondering how to write good C?  Make object ownership explicit.  Never have malloc and free more than a page of code apart.  Don't expose data structures as API.  Make errors put your routine into a defined state that the caller can understand.  Use bstrings instead of cstrings.<p>And although I don't write much C++, the more I learn about it, the more I believe it's possible to write good C++.  Most people won't spend the time to write good software, and when you do that in C or C++ it's an absolute disaster.  But if you go slowly, plan, think, exercise care, and review your work regularly, you can get good code that runs fast.<p>You can write a safe Haskell application in 10x less time than you can write a safe C++ application, though.)",1318545501

This is at best highly misleading. I bought this laptop under the delusion that choosing components that were supported by open source in-tree drivers written by the actual hardware vendor was the right decision to make. Alas, Natty out of the box hangs quite frequently, and X is very unstable. The DisplayPort output is unusable, and even non-DisplayPort output via an adapter didn't quite work.<p>After quite a lot of fiddling, I've found that the latest upstream kernels (I'm using 3.1-RC9 at the moment) from the Kernel PPA mostly fix the hanging, and using KDE with the XRender compositing backend addresses the rest of the issues I have. OpenGL stability is still a disaster, but I don't really have any need it for anything. I'm not sure if native DisplayPort actually works yet; I got a small HDMI adapter to use instead. Using XFCE would probably work just as well, but don't expect stability from Compiz.<p>Oh, and if you use dm-crypt (which you should on a laptop) you'll get a stupid error from Grub on every boot  unless you uncomment GRUB_TERMINAL=console in /etc/default/grub (&& run update-grub).

He is not a developer in any sense of the word; WordPress Assembler is more of an apt description. He had never needed to use, nor came across any reasons demonstrating a need for, a VCS.<p>Trying to get him to realize why it was such a good idea is still an ongoing battle, but I eventually won him over with the following argument:<p>""Just take my word for it. I can sit here and keep trying to hammer home the same points, over and over, and you'll sit here and keep denying them. So lets just stop this, and you just take my word for it. This project is going to live in source control. If you hate Mercurial and want something simpler, we can switch to something else. But you aren't getting away from this. And any projects we do in the future, will ALSO be in source control. So you may as well make peace with it now.""<p>The thing I believe he was really missing, and that we (I) haven't implemented yet is a continuous integration solution, with simplified deployments directly from the checked in source. His major gripe about not developing directly on the production server was the time it took to see changes. Which is a little silly, but when I look at it from his perspective, I can see his point. If I had taken the time to set that up from the start, he would've seen the benefit of it more immediately.<p>The moral of my story? Always use some kind of VCS. It may seem like a waste of time with just yourself on the project, but you'll always know for sure you have a copy of your work, safe and sound, accessible from anywhere you need it from. Just make it a part of your life, and before you know it, the ""overhead"" of using one will more or less disappear from your life.

Proof: Knuth's TeX was written in Pascal.<p>Not to mention everything that was written in FORTRAN.<p>> I still occasionally run programs originally written in 1981 for a single-processor 16-bit PDP-11 with 64k of RAM per program, and they're still efficient<p>Try to check when most of the FORTRAN libraries still used today were written.

You can also find why:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_aliasing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_aliasing</a><p>> ""Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language""<p>The paper, as far as I remember, doesn't claim impossibility of writing useful software, mainly laments for the lack of return, break, continue constructs, which are convenient to have but not real show-stoppers. Note also that Pascal standard features are just to be a ""learner's language"" not a ""system language"" -- for which there were working compilers and uses before C.<p>>  You couldn't run the Burroughs 5000 Master Control Program on a PDP-11, as far as I know, at all, and certainly not efficiently.<p>You'd also have to port Unix the same way you had to port MCP -- you can think of MCP as Unix in which drivers are part of the kernel -- but ""integer"" in ALGOL is certainly as portable as ""int"" in Unix -- they both fit the ""hardware word.""<p>Nicer pointer arithmetics in C is a good point. Though note that Wirth also had ""Pascal lite"" with pointers and which was closer to assembly for OS-level stuff just as Burroughs had ALGOL lite for OS-level stuff. The concepts of ""closer to assembly"" but higher-level languages existed certainly well before C. The idea to separate kernel and drivers is something else, and I don't know who achieved that first and when.<p>Finally, see Google's go -- it's more or less acceptance of Wirth's directions, mixed with terser notation of C.

It turned out though that the product we're selling is more support intensive then expected (which is not a problem in itself because customers are paying for support), so the ""nice problem to have"" is to scale the team of three devs, automate various tasks and measure the performance of the support work-flows (response times, SLA violations etc). I'd really appreciate if you could share your experience and stories with customer care management and the work-flows and tools you're using to execute and monitor them.<p>We settled with SugarCRM to manage our customers and their contact persons as well as the leads and opportunities. Internally we use MantisBT (with an LDAP back-end) for bug-tracking and feature planning, and that's what our customers use to submit tickets to us as well. So we've already redundant data, on one hand the Contacts in the CRM, and on the other hand the accounts in LDAP, which we need to insert manually. This is ok for now with only three engineers and a handful of customers to manage, but I fear it'll get ugly and unmaintainable as we grow.<p>Can you recommend solutions or services for customer ticketing systems, which integrate properly into an existing CRM system by using it as an authentication backend, and which check in the CRM system for a valid support contract and use the SLA data to properly set escalation triggers? Also our current setup doesn't allow to easily fetch metrics for performance measurement, so I fear we started off with the wrong tools I guess.<p>I'd like to avoid to implement all that kind of integration using the Mantis and Sugar APIs and some Dashboard system if possible, probably we can migrate to something more suitable as long as the amount of data to migrate is quite small?

Once you have system-level cloud sync, don't you want to let Apple do the work? Sync is hard, and it isn't really the core value of Instapaper.<p>Edit: I was wondering about iCloud only for iOS 5/MacOS 10.7.2 devices with iCloud accounts. But that story does fall apart for people with mixed devices. So never mind.",1318543286

Doing it in a way that prevents management from knowing who is leading the push is also quite doable.  In fact, a group of employees could negotiate in unison by every one of them sending emails to management with the same content at the same time - making it impossible to single out anyone for firing.  So again, I don't see your point.<p>The issue about executives destroying a company is an issue for the board of directors, who fire and hire the executives.  If the board agrees to sell their company and the shareholders agree, etc, that is their prerogative as they own the company, not management or the employees.  Unions are powerless in this context, which is a good thing.<p>But I guess the reality is that unions in the US are shrinking fast as they are becoming increasingly irrelevant.  ",1178888366

21311,comment,20249,21253,0,0,Goladus,,,"As PG said in ""How to Create Wealth"" the contributions of individual workers can not be measured individually.  They have to be measured as a whole.  That's why the negotiations often need to be done at the organizational level, rather than on an individual basis.<p>The problem there, of course, is that it becomes harder to hire and fire, thus it becomes harder to maximize the skill of your workforce.  Which is why employers really need to think about the consequences of being evil.",1178887311
21310,comment,20249,20796,0,0,Goladus,,,"""What stops employees from organizing themselves?"" <p>The companies themselves are one thing.  I mentioned the practice called blacklisting above.  If employees attempt to organize, the company fires the leaders and prevent them from being employed anywhere else in the industry.  This, so far as I know, is currently very illegal because of the laws protecting Unions.<p>Once the workers are disorganized, they're at a big disadvantage.  If we assume that individuals are unable to organize because employers use unethical tactics to keep them that way, knowledge and input on company policies becomes much harder to fight for.<p>Suppose top executives want to ""cash out,"" and pursue a deal that is bad for the long term health and stability of the company but good for short term revenues and stock price.  Normal workers are generally too busy with their jobs and families to spend time investigating that sort of thing.  By the time the peons find out that a deal has been made, it's way too late to do anything.  One of the things Unions theoretically do is ensure the workers have a voice.  A Union leader would be involved somehow in the writing of the contract, and when they started talking about sending valuable training personel to a direct competitor he'd be able to fight it with the leverage of the entire Union.<p>But I am not a lawyer and not an expert on Union law, so I cannot give a complete example.

However, I think you&#x27;re wrong in saying that people don&#x27;t try to deliberately build &quot;grow-big&quot; companies.<p>Believe me, I&#x27;m a proponent of building small-growth &quot;bootstrapped&quot; companies, and I&#x27;ve had many conversations with founders about going that route. The vast majority, who had it in their heads that they wanted to be a startup, were deliberate in pursuing &quot;grow-big&quot; strategies. As one easy example, almost every company that raises VC money is either implicitly or, often, explicitly, chasing a grow-big strategy.<p>I completely agree that the vast majority of companies end up <i>not</i> being able to grow big, and have to decide between becoming a small company and &quot;milking the cow&quot; as you put it, or closing the company. This doesn&#x27;t mean that they didn&#x27;t set out, in the first place, to build a &quot;grow big&quot; company! In fact, you can see that this is true in the way that so many of these companies choose <i>not</i> to continue the small business, which could be profitable, but instead choose to fold the company instead.<p>In fact, reading the writings of YC, or talking with most honest VCs, will easily prove my point - they constantly tell you they are aiming to fund companies striving for $1b+ valuations, and they&#x27;re fine with 99% of the startups they fund not getting there as long as 1% succeed. They are quite explicitly optimizing for &quot;grow big&quot; strategies.<p>Btw, I&#x27;d like to point out nl&#x27;s comment below about Steve Blank&#x27;s definition of a startup, which I always thought was the absolute best definition. A startup is an organization in search of a business model. When someone opens a pizzeria or a software consultancy, say, they&#x27;re not searching for a business model - they&#x27;re just executing one. But VC-backed &quot;grow big&quot; startups are very explicitly trying something new.<p>EDIT: Just to make sure we&#x27;re not arguing over definitions - I&#x27;m claiming two things:<p>1. That what people, especially on HN, mean when they startup is a company pursuing a &quot;grow big&quot; strategy, and deliberately so vs. a non &quot;grow big&quot; strategy.<p>2. Regardless of 1, I also think that the majority of modern-day companies (let&#x27;s say founded in the last 20 years?) that have grown big were deliberately started with the intention of growing big, ala Amazon, as opposed to say FB or Google, which wouldn&#x27;t fall into this category. I&#x27;m less sure about this point, but it is a factual question that we should probably be able to answer.",1451951367

But within the community you mention, Medium has a few traits that earned its place as the forum for these posts.<p>First, there is distribution built into the platform. Recommendations can get a piece in front of a lot more readers, especially when a piece gets promoted in an email or through notifications in the app.<p>Next, there&#x27;s the writing experience. I&#x27;ve used pretty much every major English language blogging platform and Medium has the simplest, smoothest writing experience, in part because they remove so many design and formatting options, while still leaving the ones most people want.<p>The final key reason is the one that geeks here will probably find most annoying, and that is what Medium signifies in culture. It&#x27;s come to represent a certain kind of writing that, when good, is quite thoughtful, but when self-serving (as were many early, high-visibility Medium pieces), can be insufferable. But platforms come to signify meaning; marketers write thinkpieces on LinkedIn, fanfic writers gravitate to Wattpad, and people with illicit data dumps find their way to Pastebin. There&#x27;s no reason any of these sites couldn&#x27;t host any piece of writing, but each community is a place that represents something.<p>I&#x27;ve been blogging for almost 17 years, and being busy is the only thing that&#x27;s really kept me from moving my blog to Medium. I understand others have legitimate qualms about using hosted services, but given their APIs, I&#x27;m not worried about that.

We extend this finding to political candi- dates by comparing the relative effects of candidate familiarity as well as partisan, issue, gender, and facial similarity on voters’ evaluations of candidates. In Experiment 1, during the week of the 2006 Florida gubernatorial race, a national representative sample of voters viewed images of two unfamiliar candidates (Crist and Davis) morphed with either themselves or other voters. Results demonstrated a strong prefer- ence for facially similar candidates, despite no conscious awareness of the similarity manipulation. In Experiment 2, one week before the 2004 presidential election, a national representative sample of voters evaluated familiar candidates (Bush and Kerry). Strong partisans were unmoved by the facial similarity manipulation, but weak partisans and independents preferred the candidate with whom their own face had been morphed over the candidate morphed with another voter. In Experiment 3, we compared the effects of policy similarity and facial similarity using a set of prospec- tive 2008 presidential candidates. Even though the effects of party and policy similarity dominated, facial similarity proved a significant cue for unfamiliar candidates. Thus, the evidence across the three studies sug- gests that even in high-profile elections, voters prefer candidates high in facial similarity, but most strongly with unfamiliar candidates.",1451950890

Nobody serious said inequality was bad or good, not even Piketty. The discussion is about <i>degrees</i>, and PG adds nothing to it by arguing categorically.<p>That we are talking degrees of inequality is also the reason why economists argue with statistics and do not differentiate much between specific causes or mechanisms on the micro level. Sorry to burst that bubble but PG is not a &quot;creator of inequality&quot; on the level that is interesting. Shifting a few hundred people around means nothing given that we are talking about income and wealth distributions over millions of households in the US alone (and increasing inequality is a global phenomenon). Clearly, tax policy, financial (de)regulation, labor market policies, even the fall of the Soviet Union, etc. are more relevant than petty arguments over whether this startup or that high freq trader made a few mega- or even gigabucks in a nice or not so nice way.<p>On a sidenote, the relative impacts of the trader vs the startupper on aggregate welfare is not as clearcut as intimated by PG at all, once you take second- and higher-order effects into account. Furthermore, creating wealth for some individuals may also decrease overall inequality; it depends on the starting and end positions of said individuals in the wealth distribution and the other ongoing processes in the economy.<p>Lastly, economic systems have a lot of feedback mechanisms, both positive (ie destabilizing) and negative (stabilizing). We should at least consider the possibility that past a certain degree of inequality, wealth becomes self-perpetuating. This is especially pertinent for US Americans, given the degenerate nature of their &quot;democracy&quot;.",1451950801

It erodes the broad social/economic power balance in our society, atrophies our civic institutions or coöpts them into quasi-fascist tools of the elite, breaks our journalistic institutions and cheapens our political discourse, diverts our resources into building wasteful things, and prevents us from tackling the serious challenges we face, while leaving millions of people struggling for basic survival.<p>I don’t see Paul Graham out there fighting in any concrete way for improvements to any of the “bad things that cause inequality” he hand-waves away. Where’s his work to improve labor rights, end police brutality, guarantee a functioning healthcare system, track down and close tax loopholes, expose and regulate industrial polluters, or figure out how to save the lives of all the people economically displaced by his startup “disruptor” buddies? Where’s his respect or help for teachers, social workers, doctors, policemen, civil rights activists, local politicians, garbage collectors, journalists, mail carriers, or any of the other people who keep our civil society functioning in return for regular wages.

It means they <i>fall back on</i> thinking; or, more precisely, they <i>think of themselves as being the kind of person who</i> falls back on thinking rather than feeling.

One day, robots, 3d printing, and AI services (e.g. self driving everything), may put the majority of human beings out of a job. How can entrepreneurs or capitalists even get rich if the majority of people&#x27;s work has no surplus value?<p>In such an end state, the concept of regular folks working is practically extinct and there should be a basic income, so that the massive returns to automation continue to benefit everyone and provide income for people to spend. Think of it as an extreme version of social security: Instead of 1 worker supporting 10 retirees, you have 1 robot, or 1 AI supporting hundreds of &quot;retirees&quot; (from birth) using &quot;wages&quot; that are no longer paid to the robot (labor), but to the capitalist.<p>Hans Moravec in _Mind Children_ outlined a version of this 20 years in how increasing productivity from automation will gradually produce a society that looks more like a hunter gather society and less than an industrial one, in that the basic needs of the population will literally &quot;grow&quot; on trees (robotic manufacturing bush robots)<p>My point is, if you want to look at extremes, then extreme unchecked technology and inequality will produce a degenerate broken economy in the long run, so quite clearly, there must be mitigating factors to keep the capitalist system going.<p>I like PG&#x27;s framing of the issues, but dislike his conclusions, which are unsubstantiated and basically fall to a kind of nativist/natural fallacy, that because something is a natural driving force, it should not be opposed, or else bad things will happen.<p>History is replete with humans changing their natural physical or economic environment, and we will continue to do so.<p>I think one can address economic inequality and it would not prevent startups or &quot;big winners&quot;.

That&#x27;s an unsubstantiated claim as well, but if you comparatively look at other countries, you can&#x27;t really find a tight correspondence between the level of social welfare and failure of startup culture.

Star wars is a Space Fantasy, science fiction while not ALWAYS accurate hinges on at least trying it&#x27;s best to be &#x27;real&#x27; or use as much real science as possible.

He never referred to it as only science fiction. Star Wars doesn&#x27;t hold itself to use science: space craft bank in a vacuum like airplanes do in air, there&#x27;s the Force (a type of magic or at least metaphysics), .... Star Wars is about epic story telling and not one to get caught up in details such as physics and using the scientific process to solve a problem. This is also why it&#x27;s felt that JJ Abrams is a great choice for directing Star Wars movies, much more so than Star Trek which spent much effort on not violating laws of physics or at least having a really good technical explanation why something works. Star Wars doesn&#x27;t attempt to use science to solve problems where as science fiction series such as Star Trek expose science to the audience in an attempt to engage them as to the difficulty of the problem, some possible solutions, and how to conduct experiments to decide upon a solution.&quot;",1451949735

While it is true that a lack of new construction has a role in rising costs, so does the gulf between the lowest and highest paid workers. Where income inequality is high, but people are still competing for the same scarce resources, prices are going to get further and further out of reach for people at the low end.<p>Arguably, an influx of relatively highly paid workers is a result of wealth being &quot;created&quot;, but if I&#x27;m the janitor at Stanford who has to commute from Stockton [1], does it actually matter <i>why</i> there is income inequality?<p>Income inequality means, regardless of how it is generated, that a huge amount of wealth is being created and the benefits are being concentrated to a few people. And in the case of where I live, it means things that things that used to be accessible to lots of people have been placed out of reach. It <i>doesn&#x27;t matter</i> how it happened.

You have a remarkably solid, cross platform, well tested product and they&#x27;re very very cautious to harm that, even with big speed and feature improvements on the table.

I&#x27;m having trouble calculating a max SNAP/food stamps benefit that would exceed $194/month for an individual in urban NYC. Is that modest? Sure, I bet there are some people who are satisfied living off of public welfare alone. They exist in every country, and probably in greater numbers in more-socialized countries. I&#x27;m unconvinced that the problem is big enough to warrant cutting any public-welfare programs. Some level of &quot;mooching&quot; is expected.<p>For me, when I was growing up on food stamps and welfare as a refugee, I know that it wasn&#x27;t a level of living my family wanted to settle at.

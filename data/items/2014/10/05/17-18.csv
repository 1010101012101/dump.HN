It&#x27;s a combinatorial problem. Given a typical general election ballot (say 10-30 issues, with 1-6 choices each), the pool of voters (ballots cast) would need to number in the 100,000s.<p>Alas, elections are administered per precinct, which typically number 1 - 1,000 voters.<p>To use crypto election administration would require splitting our ballots into a ballot per issue, greatly increasing the size of precincts, or both.<p>But whatever the case, the burden of proof for this hair brained ideas is on the proponents. And until they (you) assume the responsibility of proving these systems work for real world elections, I&#x27;m not interested.",1412531938

8412886,comment,8411762,8412794,1,0,rsanheim,,,"> It needs to be stated that most practitioners of Zen Buddhism, in both the east and the west, consider Alan Watts to be misinformed about Zen. Some might even call him a charlatan.<p>Citation needed please.<p>Watts certainly has his flaws, one of which was that he simply wrote and spoke <i></i>so much<i></i> that I think some of the material suffers and becomes repetitive.  He always took more of a wide view of religions (east and west) than just focusing narrowly on zen.  Watts wrote about Taoism, Christianity, Hinduism, and materialism in addition and often in contrast to Buddhism.  I&#x27;m not sure even he would lay claim to being an expert on Zen, but when he certainly was responsibly to turning on a lot of westerners to it.  Many of those who then went on into deeper study with more &quot;true&quot; Zen teachers (whatever that means).",1412531724

8412881,comment,8411762,8411762,1,0,doorhammer,,,"Throwing my experience with meditation down in here.  I said almost exactly the same thing in another post recently.  I should preface this with saying that while I&#x27;m attracted to Zen Buddhism, and ended up getting an accidental minor in east asian religious studies way back when, I don&#x27;t meditate <i>because</i> of Zen Buddhism (though obviously I acknowledge a lot of the history there).<p>I fairly consistently meditate. I don&#x27;t spend more than five or ten minutes in any given setting, so you might not consider me a hard core meditator, but I do feel that it&#x27;s provided me with some positive mental tools.  I&#x27;m going to focus on the ones that aren&#x27;t necessarily related to long term average increases in objective health and wellbeing and more on a subjective perception that I have new cognitive strategies to deal with certain situations.<p>As an example, I used to be pretty anxious about falling asleep, and I think it caused it to be more difficult to fall asleep. Some of the insight meditation practices helped me deal with the anxiety feedback loop. It wasn&#x27;t something crazy or mystical; I mostly just learned how to effectively stop thinking about something, or at least stop focussing on something.  Ordinarily trying to stop thinking about something had led to a nasty loop.  I can&#x27;t sleep, so I get anxious, the anxiety makes it harder to sleep, which makes me more anxious.<p>The meditation got me more comfortable with just sitting, for one, and secondly it helped me learn to acknowledge a thought, and &quot;let go&quot; of it.  Eventually I got to a point where I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep, but whenever a thought that would provoke anxiety popped up, it would just sort of pass by, and I never actually felt the emotional reaction.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I fall asleep any faster (again none of this is quantitative data), but I do find that I just don&#x27;t care anymore because the anxiety isn&#x27;t there.  It&#x27;s not the effect I expected when I started meditating, but it&#x27;s just as, if not more effective.<p>I continue with it because it&#x27;s pretty easy to carve out five or ten minutes here and there. I have no idea if it&#x27;s causing any long term health benefits, nor does it really matter to me. Subjectively I feel more relaxed right after I meditate, but that&#x27;s about it. Honestly, I&#x27;d keep doing it just because it feels nice. I don&#x27;t do any crazy postures or full lotus, or anything like that; maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing out on, but I do plan on continuing the practice as I perform it.  I try to keep my reasons for that as subjectively tangible and non religious/spiritual as possible.<p>Side Note: The book &quot;The Wisdom of Insecurity&quot; is an interesting Alan Watts book.  I like Watts work but like anything, I have a tendency to read things looking for what&#x27;s wrong with what the author is saying.  Eventually I learned to more actively look for what&#x27;s useful instead, which I think is helpful with that kind of book, otherwise I end up in this endless cycle of critique, which is fun but doesn&#x27;t really get me anywhere.  (I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t do critical analysis; more just be aware that there can be value in imperfect works)<p></book>",1412531652

There are numerous tolls and each give the police the ability to track any car to a small area.  So ther is very little auto crime.<p>* There are speed cameras about every 10km, which residents speed up and speed down to &quot;obey&quot; the speed limit.  So to whomever was talking about high speed chases: they don&#x27;t happen.  They just wait for the criminal to stop, know exactly where he is, and then apprehend him.<p>* Most projects I worked on had a whole component about being &quot;the best&quot;, &quot;the biggest&quot;, &quot;the tallest&quot; where we would have to show why {{costly technology}} is the best in the world.  There was no definition of &quot;the best&quot; beyond just claiming something.<p>* In my apartment building, there were cameras from outside my door to the carpark in the basement.  And they were regularly watched.  I know this because the door man would make it a habit of hitting the elevator button for me when I was about a meter away from the elevator, having seen me from CC cameras far below<p>* To those talking about how burqas and hijabs will make this technology impossible: most folks there don&#x27;t wear traditional, national dress.  87% of the country are westerners who stay there for an average of 2 years and leave.  Westerners and low-wage workers are who they want to track anyway.<p>* All internet is filtered by &quot;du&quot; and &quot;Etisalat&quot; (think ATT and Verizon) - by order of the state.  But they don&#x27;t maintain a common block list, so some websites work on du, some on Etisalat.<p>* There are large articles on this, but basically the UAE compelled Blackberry to allow them to install backdoors so that the government could circumvent secure communication (this was back when Blackberry was dominant).<p>And there are many more.<p>I&#x27;m not saying other countries don&#x27;t have these problems.  I&#x27;m more just listing these things out to show that this is exactly the kind of project that Dubai would love - high technology, spectacle, and above all controlling.",1412531338

You can only do that with small rotors due to inertia, so with large rotors you&#x27;ll need variable pitch to change the thrust.

The easiest way is just to phase distort the bus (sorta) so what you called bit X is now bit X-4 for all bits on the bus, and use a 2x1 mux to select which, and cascade rollers in binary (you don&#x27;t need a roller for all integer numbers if you can cascade them 16, 8, 2, 1 position only activating some rolls).  If you can rotate, you can shift by adding one more stage at the end that does bit oriented ops to clear MSBs or LSBs.  Also if your roller is capable of rolling all bits on the bus, you don&#x27;t need two rollers one in each direction.  Latency does add up of course, all those cascaded ops.<p>Also I saw in the notes the Rodney Zaks z80 book being referenced.  I learned assembly from that book, back when it was new.

8412858,comment,8411754,8411754,1,0,Animats,,,"Yes, you can use a relational database as a dumb object store, but do you want to? There seems to be a great fear of SQL among programmers, which is puzzling, because the basic operations aren&#x27;t very complicated.<p>There&#x27;s an annoying mismatch between SQL and data structures.  SQL&#x27;s approach of making all queries a big string is a pain, especially since careful escaping is needed to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities. However, in Go, it&#x27;s not too hard to get data in and out of SQL as an &quot;[]interface&quot;, which is a mixed array of any type. Converting that to a struct is straightforward.  This comes up often enough that Go should have compiler support for struct <-> []interface.  It can be done through introspection, as some of the ORMs do, but that&#x27;s slow.  The layout of the struct is fixed at compile time, so this can generate fast code, mostly type checks and moves. In general, we should have more compiler support for marshalling. It&#x27;s done a lot, it&#x27;s easy to compile, and it&#x27;s slow to do interpretively.<p>If we had that, much of the need for the ORMs described would go away.",1412531112

One paper I thought was interesting is GraphChi, a graph processing framework that runs on a single machine:<p><a href=""http://graphlab.org/projects/graphchi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphlab.org/projects/graphchi.html</a><p>Graphs can be encoded very efficiently; you need a pair of integer IDs for a pair of nodes, and maybe a weight or some other small payload data.  A graph of say 7 billion nodes for everyone in the world will often fit in memory on a single machine these days, depending on the number of edges.  GraphChi uses disk, so you have even more space, if you are willing to constrain the model (MapReduce is of course already heavily constrained, especially for graphs).<p>The raw source data is probably larger than a machine, but you could just run a MapReduce to copy it out into a bunch of (ID, ID) pairs, do your hairy graph algorithms on a single machine, then export the result back your data store with a MapReduce join.<p>You could use either something like GraphChi or just an arbitrary C/Java program working on a big graph in memory.<p>My hunch is that this is a lot more tractable that sequential MapReduce...

Some might even call him a charlatan.<p>I studied religious history as an undergrad and one conversation specifically comes to mind. I asked my Japanese humanities professor what most eastern Zen practitioners thought of western Zen practitioners. She responded by saying that most western practitioners were well respected by their eastern counterparts, with the exception of Alan Watts. She called him out by name.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve encountered Watt&#x27;s speeches and writings and never really gotten much out of them. He just comes across as someone who doesn&#x27;t understand Zen Buddhism. He&#x27;s also a prosletyzer, which as a concept, derives explicitly from the west.<p>Most westerners who were talking about Zen in the 1960&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s didn&#x27;t understand it. For example, the beat writers terribly understood many concepts of Zen. So it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that Alan Watts didn&#x27;t get it either.<p>None of this is meant to detract from people who have read Alan Watts and exxperienced some increase in well being as a consequence. It&#x27;s just that increased well being should not be central in ones&#x27; desire to pursue Zen. So if reading Alan Watts makes you feel good, then by all means keep reading Alan Watts. Just understand that you&#x27;re receiving something which is packaged incorrectly. It has the wrong label on the package.<p>If, like me, you&#x27;re interested in learning about Zen from a scholarly perspective than I recommend you start with reading stories of celebrated monks first. Then move on to more philosophical tomes later.<p>This book is fun to read and will give you an idea of Zen&#x27;s history.\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Crazy-Clouds-Radicals-Rebels-Reformers/dp/0877735433%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Crazy-Clouds-Radicals-Rebels-Reformers...</a><p>This book provides a good introductory text about Zen.

8412728,comment,8411225,8411225,1,0,galaxyLogic,,,"The big idea with OOP is &quot;messaging&quot;. Right. What makes messaging useful is that the &#x27;messagee&#x27; typically understands more than one different message. Because if it only understood one we couldn&#x27;t take advantage of composing the interaction with them in different ways, as needed by the client.<p>When we can do that we can also replace the messagee with an instance of some other conformant class, and thus we can reuse the client-side implementation of the interaction-protocol with many different types of recipients.<p>Using the word &quot;replace&quot; here is easily misleading. A better word is &quot;reuse&quot;. We don&#x27;t typically DELETE the original service object at all. More likely we just REUSE the same client-code with different types of &quot;service objects&quot;. The point is it can interact with many differently implemented service-objects that offer the same interface.<p>If each class defined only one message it responds to, that wouldn&#x27;t look like OOP, would it? It would look like FP where functions basically understand just one message, &quot;Tell me your value!&quot;.<p>Of course FP languages can simulate OOP and vice versa. Smalltalk for instance defines the class BlockClosure which understands the message #value: (among others). That means - &quot;Tell me your value for this argument&quot;. But BlockClosure also understands other messages, like #asString, #class etc. That is OOP.<p>We could say that OOP is a generalization of FP in this sense. Objects can do what functions do, calculate their &quot;value&quot; for a given argument. But this operation is explicitly declared as just one of the operations that object can perform. There is NO SPECIAL syntax for it, like &quot;()&quot; in FP languages.<p>JavaScript can be characterized as a functional-object -language because its functions are first-class citizens but they can also have other operations than calculating their value. We can for instance &quot;send the message&quot; .toString() to them to get their source-code.<p>You could have a &quot;messaging conversation&quot; with a JavaScript function (-object) like this:<p>Me to function:  &quot;Hey tell me your source-code&quot;. The function returns it<p>Me to my Helper -object: &quot;Hey helper, does this source-code look secure?&quot;.  Helper returns &quot;Yes&quot;.<p>Me to function: &quot;OK, I trust you. Tell me your value for argument 42!&quot;. Function returns it.<p>The conversation / messaging above could be reused with some other type of object without having to modify the client-side code at all.<p>Summary: The essence of OOP is that objects can declare MULTIPLE messages they respond to, thus defining the protocol they can be interacted with. Many objects can support the same protocol of interacting with them, but provide a different implementation as to how they actually calculate some (or all) responses to the messages they get.",1412528432

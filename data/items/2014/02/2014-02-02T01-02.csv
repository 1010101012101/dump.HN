Based on long-term studies of survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan and of nuclear industry workers, the incidence of eventual cancer increases with increasing exposure to radiation at levels above 100 millisieverts/year. The effect is linear. Below 100 millisieverts/year, however, no increased cancer incidence has been detected, either because it doesn&#x27;t exist or because the numbers are so low that any signal gets lost in the epidemiological noise.&quot;<p>IDK if his case if convincing or not. In any case, even if say 10, 50 or 100 millisieverts a year is something the human body can shrug off with no increase in risk, I imagine that might not apply to 10-30 millisieverts delivered in a very short interval of time.",1391305888

We forecast at this level as real estate truly is local, and we’ve found there are huge differences in how markets move between zip codes in a county.  Our forecasts have over 90% accuracy forecasting housing prices up to 3 years out for most US real estate markets.  We have back-tested these models for accuracy over the past 40 years, so that we can have confidence in calling the major market turns, and also understand where we are in the cycle and the likely future returns.<p>We are currently working with sophisticated institutions such as homebuilders, land investors, mortgage banks, etc. to use these forecasts.<p>We will be building housecanary.com into a full consumer oriented website in early 2014.  We want to provide property owners in the US with a simple and accurate forecast for what is likely to happen to their home&#x27;s value over the next few years (at a zip code level), given that a home represents most people&#x27;s single largest investment in life. There are many people who want to better understand and plan for future price swings, similar to how they manage the rest of their financial assets, however currently, there is insufficient information available to consumers.  We can now provide 80M US households with powerful data/forecasts only the largest banks and hedge funds had access to historically.<p>Positions available:<p>UI/UX Designer - Our ideal designer will be able to build beautiful and simple web sites, help out with product design and implement the designs in HTML and CSS.

You cannot just load such a game up in an emulator if the server containing half the code (yes that&#x27;s hyperbole, it&#x27;s a smaller but no less important amount) no longer exists.<p>People have reimplemented the servers for very important online games in the past. Off the top of my head, Phantasy Star Online (one of the first MMOs) and Vanilla World of Warcraft both have fanmade reverse-engineered recreations of their server software that allow people to play the original game as it was when they were released, even though Sega and Blizzard respectively have long since shut down their official servers. To reiterate, they did this with only information from the game client, neither the source nor binaries of these games&#x27; server software were ever made available. I can only imagine how tremendous of an effort this must have been for the fans, but they did it out of love for these games and the time they spent playing them.<p>Now imagine that one of the various free to play IAP games gets shut down tomorrow. Game binaries that worked fine yesterday are now useless. Chances are, no one cares nearly as much as the aforementioned MMO fans (it&#x27;s a hell of a lot of work, and I&#x27;m going out on a limb and saying that skilled reverse engineers are more likely to be interested in MMOs than cow clickers), and the reverse engineered replacement never gets started.

7164355,comment,7163818,7163818,11,0,contextfree,,,"Kudos to Jay Machalani for a great demonstration of the concept, but I have a couple of big problems with it, or in general any design that splits the current unified tablet/PC design we see in Windows 8 into two strictly separated modes (of course, having two totally separate SKUs or OSs can be thought of as an even more extreme version of this):<p>1. It breaks useful cross-mode windowing scenarios.<p>Having a strict modal separation between the two windowing models breaks a bunch of IMO not terribly uncommon scenarios where mixing them in some way is useful.<p>* Can&#x27;t have a different mode on each monitor - if one is touch/a tablet and the other isn&#x27;t, for example.<p>* Can&#x27;t snap an app beside the desktop and have the system automatically manage the use of the remaining space. There are actually some desktop apps that have hacked a custom implementation of this - OneNote for example - so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a contrived scenario.<p>* Sometimes I like to use the availability of desktop and immersive windows to express a &quot;work versus play&quot; (or, more precisely, &quot;continuing part of ongoing persistent task versus transient digression&quot;) distinction. That way I can use the &quot;transient/play&quot; apps without worrying about them cluttering the taskbar, slowing down the PC, interfering with what I&#x27;m doing, etc. Modal separation breaks that.<p>* Some apps just work better with one or the other windowing model - e.g., part of what I really like about Tweetium is how clicking on a link will automatically shrink the Tweetium window down to a narrow strip and open a browser window in the remaining space. That of course depends on the immersive windowing APIs. Other apps such as calculators or &quot;sticky notes&quot; work better in desktop windows. So it would be nice to have apps like this automatically open in the right kind of window, or at least allow the user to set this per-app, rather than requiring an obnoxious global mode switch that potentially messes with everything else.<p>2. Desktop apps inherently clash with the immersive app model and UX.<p>While running immersive apps in desktop windows seems like it could probably work well, I&#x27;m really leery of the reverse. There are a few potential problems with running desktop apps in immersive windows that I see:<p>* Desktop apps can open multiple windows and draw outside of their window. Some apps (ab)use this quite a bit for dialogs, palette windows, etc. This could get pretty awkward to map to immersive windowing - do we put each in its own &quot;strip&quot;? Do we make each &quot;strip&quot; a little virtual desktop where the app can put additional windows? Do we try some mix of the two approaches, and if so, how does the OS decide which is which?<p>* A goal of the immersive app model was that the user wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about closing apps or which apps were/weren&#x27;t running - indeed that the concept of &quot;running apps&quot; wouldn&#x27;t exist for most users. The system UI was designed around that - no &quot;X&quot; to close, no taskbar to show what&#x27;s open. But desktop apps can do anything in the background, so closing them and knowing what&#x27;s running is important. And when you switch modes back into the desktop, which apps should even be kept open? Since &quot;metro&quot; mode blurs the lines between running and suspended apps, it&#x27;s not clear.<p>And if you can&#x27;t run desktop apps in immersive windows, and in general have a 1:1 mapping of running system/app state between modes, you can&#x27;t really have a pure modal separation - either the mode switch is made destructive and essentially becomes a reboot, or you&#x27;re left with a bunch of hidden stuff &quot;running in the other mode&quot; which doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Once you really start thinking through the ramifications of alternative models the current desktop-as-an-app model starts to seem pretty elegant in some ways IMO.",1391304516

And a single $1.99 IAP has the same problem because while you might get 10x downloads from being free initially, you&#x27;ll still only get your $2 from <10% of them, and $2 LTV is not nearly enough to support a game (+ some gamers like those here might be willing to support a great game with more than $2 but won&#x27;t have the option to do so in this setup).<p>At the end of the day, when people invest in an entertainment experience they want to be entertained.

If you read the Australian study for example, they certainly could not determine with certainty how many CT scans an individual had, because they did not include CT scans performed in hospitals. I would say that MOST CT scans performed in children would happen in hospitals. Therefore, a person having one CT may simply be a marker of them having many more CTs which are not captured by the study.<p>There were also other unusual correlations in the data. For example, CT scans of the brain seemed to increase the risk of cancer elsewhere in the body, and scans of the abdomen increased the risk of brain cancer. This seems implausible, and implies to me that at least some of the correlation between CTs and cancer is likely to be explained by some third factor whereby people with an increased risk for cancer have more CT scans. The most telling correlations are probably for rare tumours, like soft tissue cancers eg sarcoma, which show an increased risk post CT. These cancers are rare and have few known risk factors, so this correlation is more believable. But these events were much rarer than all cancers in the cohort.",1391303359

See edx.org, class.stanford.edu, france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr or codecoalition.com for examples of edX instances.<p>It&#x27;s a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture (a lot of the edX engineers come from MIT). You would work on different clients contracts using the platform. The clients list/references include Harvard, edX themselves, the French government, and various startups & universities currently running their own instances, or looking to create one. Tasks are varied, from developing custom features for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing instances, developing generic platform features, deploying instances, working on both client/server sides, etc.<p>Most of your work would be published as free software (edX is released under the AGPL license, which requires clients to release modifications under the same license), and you would also contribute to the free software project, pushing some of your developments upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation or help on mailing-lists.<p>You would be able to work remotely from where you want, as long as you have a good internet connexion. : )<p>Stack: Python/Django, Ansible, AWS, Debian/Ubuntu, JS, HTML/CSS, MySQL, MongoDB<p>Applying: Email jobs@antoviaque.org with: your github account, a short explanation of why the role interests you (no formal cover letter, please :) ) and a list of links to free software contributions you have made, if any.",1391303085

That didn&#x27;t fail; it was simply not high enough to keep out the tsunami. Which, as you note, was <i>not</i> the case for other similar reactors:<p><i>it&#x27;s also well known (documented) that this was an identified risk, and that other reactors along the coast did have sufficiently high shield walls.</i><p>Agreed. Which shows that reactor designs of that generation <i>can</i> be operated safely. See below.<p><i>You&#x27;ve omitted stockpiling reactive waste from your calculus.</i><p>Which is a lot easier if you reprocess the spent fuel, as every nuclear-using country except the US does (US policy forbade it from the mid-1970&#x27;s until about 2000, since then there have been, IIRC, contractual issues getting it started).<p><i>Ditto the inadvertent release of contamination.</i><p>Which, once again, is much smaller than other major energy sources when evaluated per unit of energy produced.<p><i>Treehuggers like me are looking for solutions, not more rhetoric.</i><p>And once again, of all the other major energy sources--by &quot;major&quot; I mean &quot;capable of sustaining the required base load capacity for a country the size of the US at first world standards of living&quot;--nuclear is by far the safest. What opposition to nuclear power by treehuggers like yourself has done is to force people to make a choice: either drastically reduce our standard of living, or use energy sources with much greater health and environmental impacts like coal and oil. Guess which choice people picked?<p>I completely agree that, now that we have safer nuclear reactor designs, we should be building them, and <i>not</i> building any more of the older, less safe designs. (I don&#x27;t know that traveling wave reactors are at the point where we can build operating plants, btw; but there are other inherently safe designs that are further along.) But given that we have plenty of existing plants that are perfectly capable of being operated safely, we can get cleaner energy from them than we can from coal and oil.",1391303064
7164286,comment,7163818,7164257,2,0,roryokane,,,"I think he was advocating <i>optional</i> app stores, not a sole-provider app store like on iOS. Even though OS X and Android have app stores, they also let you install any “unapproved” apps you want and open whatever web apps you want, after changing a one-time setting. The proposed Windows 8.2 would probably be the same.<p>As long as app stores remain optional, I think they are a good thing. It is a lot simpler for users to browse one place for apps and install all apps in the same simple way. An app store is a reassuringly simple way to install software for those who aren’t very confident with modifying their computers.",1391303025

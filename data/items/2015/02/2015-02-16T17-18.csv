I wouldn&#x27;t say I have two estimates so much as one intuition - but that&#x27;s what my intuition corresponds to, yes. If I made those estimates, I would expect to have a higher estimate for project B than project A.<p>(But I should note that I deliberately chose projects where it seemed obvious which one was better, so that I didn&#x27;t need to do any calculations or even think very hard about which one to prefer. In reality, sometimes it&#x27;s not obvious, and you should think hard and do calculations and it still might not be obvious, and the specific project being discussed is probably one of those cases.)",1424109578

It doesn&#x27;t have the ability for nuanced discussion by nature. That system needs fixing, but it may not be possible.<p>> They might be very smart, but they arrived at objectively wrong conclusions.<p>In many, many cases, we call that science. Extremely intelligent people are allowed to be wrong for many, many years, and continue searching in the cracks and crevices for the truth—as long as they&#x27;re wearing a white lab coat.<p>Of course I realize this is reducto ad absurdum—the general public is not qualified to be making such judgements. But systemically, one of the things that prevents people from making binary judgements about the world is to prevent making binary judgements about them.<p>And that starts with all of our responses, not just the media. I&#x27;m convinced that these anti-scientific (as in, people who disagree with the scientific consensus) people are more influenced by the response of their close social circles in the context of social media than by the oft untrusted old media. It is the responses of hatred from people they <i>do</i> trust that drive them further into their hole.<p>If we want these people—often your friends and family—to learn nuance and probability and tradeoffs and the ability to think in grayscale rather than black and white, then we need to teach them directly using our responses. We need to lead by example, and that begins with not calling them &quot;stupidly wrong i.e. really really wrong&quot;—even if they are. Often they <i>already are</i> thinking in grays: they have doubt where everyone else has an absolute!<p>Lots of people have been stupidly, really, really wrong in history. Some of them changed the world. That&#x27;s not likely in these cases, but it is the perspective that will make an argument rhetorically effective. And in the process, we may discover the small nuanced ways in which they were actually right—that&#x27;s the beauty of the scientific process, and that&#x27;s the reason people fight against the black and white. They have more to offer than you realize; and especially more to offer than the label &quot;stupidly wrong&quot; would have you believe.<p>For perspective, I&#x27;m almost sorry to admit it, but my mother is a vaccine... &#x27;doubter.&#x27; She is a scientist, a biologist, extremely intelligent. She has a nuanced understanding and soaks up data like a sponge, references studies in her sleep and connects more dots than a first grade class. It&#x27;s less clear-cut than you might think, and not all vaccines are equal. People like her are fighting against the absolute mentality of the mob and how the issue is thought about in public discourse—not the end result like you might think they are.

Additionally, I did not wish to start a flamewar (which always happens when you get into a discussion about the relative merits of a language on the internet).<p>My reservations about Node stem from this kind of app actually; the creation of a tool that goes far beyond the realistic and sensible use-case for Node.<p>That is, the huge benefit that Node offers is the ability to have both server- and client-side scripting in the same language; that&#x27;s awesome. However, it&#x27;s a fairly common bit of knowledge that JS is less than ideal for a wide variety of reasons (e.g., no integers, breaking the commutative property, etc.). While it may be a great alternative to PHP, it&#x27;s still not that great of a language. So, to go beyond the notion of just using it to unify the language for webapps and to start creating userland applications on such a platform seems very counterproductive to me.<p>In this case, I am especially taken by the fact that this author has made three or four projects which all do similar things but for different use-cases. If this project were made into, for example, a C library, all of the derivative projects could just source that library and be simpler for it. Not to mention the fact that other projects could interface with it as well.<p>Despite C&#x27;s reputation as being rather hard to make portable code, a public API with a C library actually makes it incredibly portable and extensible.<p>Again, I am completely okay with Node (I don&#x27;t crusade against its existence), it just saddens me to see such cool projects be based on such a platform when there are obvious benefits to using something closer to the metal.",1424109141

9058099,comment,9053759,9055571,0,0,philwelch,,,"> &quot;#1 is unsustainable outside of the hard sciences&quot;<p>> I disagree. Why do people go to college? From what I&#x27;ve read, under the GI bill, a lot of people went to college because it was a place to learn. College was cheap - a minimum wage summer job was enough to pay for a year of college even for those without the GI bill. (Colleges were also much more discriminatory, including based on race, ethnicity, and class. But that&#x27;s a different story.)<p>You&#x27;re talking about teaching, which is one side of it. The other side is research. The real ambition for anyone with a Ph.D is to land a tenure-track position, or at least a researching position, and so the only way to increase demand for these people is to increase the level of research being done. I think you could triple the amount of research being done in the hard sciences without even coming close to diminishing returns. Increasing research in the humanities would not be nearly as useful for society; arguably we&#x27;ve already reached and exceeded the point of diminishing returns there.<p>You could do something more fundamental that decouples research and teaching, but that would be a disservice, particularly in the humanities. Some of my best (undergraduate!) philosophy classes were the ones that tied into the current state of the art in my professors&#x27; research. (In the sciences this is less of a concern, probably because the foundations of the sciences are on much firmer ground. Our understanding of graph theory is a lot more certain than our understanding of free will.)<p>> ... And the number of humanities graduate students is going down.
I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s typical or not. If it is typical, then it suggests that #2 is not occurring.<p>&quot;The number of humanities graduate students going down&quot; is exactly what I meant by #2, at least in part.<p>> Regarding #3, what you said is of course true. Mine laborers are also easily replaced, as are garment workers, teamsters, shoemakers, and . There&#x27;s a well-known solution; unionize and require it be a union shop. This of course won&#x27;t work in so-called &quot;right-to-work&quot; states, which I consider them to be anti-free market laws.<p>They&#x27;re anti-free-market laws in the exact same way antitrust laws are anti-free-market. In any case, that doesn&#x27;t really solve the basic problem, it just weeds people out from academic careers earlier on, in a much more final way, instead of letting them float around in a limbo between success and failure.<p>Besides, I&#x27;m skeptical that unions will help. There are unions for baseball players and Hollywood actors, and that doesn&#x27;t stop people from scraping by trying to break into those fields.<p>Introducing a union also has the downside of adding another layer of bureaucracy into the mix, and judging from the entire rest of your comment it sounds like you&#x27;re not fond of added bureaucracy. (Who is, really?) Besides, it really is just that simple: lots and lots of people volunteer to be part-time professors at shitty pay rates, and almost no one volunteers to be a part-time bureaucrat at shitty pay rates.",1424109016

That&#x27;s 50% of the problem.<p>No.  They don&#x27;t even <i>have</i> basic scientific literacy to start with.  To quote the common material on this matter:<p>>A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of: &quot;Have you read a work of Shakespeare’s?&quot;<p>>I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question — such as, &quot;What do you mean by mass, or acceleration&quot;, which is the scientific equivalent of saying, &quot;Can you read?&quot; — not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had.<p>I would <i>hope</i> that more than 10% of humanities experts can today answer such basic questions as &quot;What is acceleration?&quot; (the second derivative of position/displacement) or &quot;Explain the significance of the Second Law of Thermodynamics to human life&quot; (humans must eat food to survive, and will eventually die).  Even if the rate is more like 95%, we are again speaking of scientific questions on the level of &quot;Have you read a classic?&quot; and &quot;Can you read at all?&quot;.  In fact, I strongly doubt that most &quot;humanists&quot; can answer the question about acceleration, since they mostly never studied any calculus -- it would have dragged down their freshman-year GPA and wasn&#x27;t required anyway.<p>Meanwhile, we have not gotten up to the level of talking about interesting hobby material (rocketry or electronics or programming), nor to the level where the &quot;humanists&quot; (<i>or even most scientists</i>) can competently understand scientific concepts essential to public life, such as the Greenhouse Effect, cognitive bias, or p-values.<p>By the standards of a modern, scientific civilization, the classical humanist is a developmentally disabled child who continues to insist, against all evidence, that he is the jewel of intellectuals and has an exclusive right to make all of society&#x27;s important choices.<p>>But I challenge you to think deeply about why the other 50% of the problem might lie with how scientists understand the humanities, because I really strongly believe that.<p>If you believe it strongly, please provide evidence.  I&#x27;m of course open to convincing evidence, but I strongly believe the opposite: the problem is <i>not</i> evenly split, it lies almost entirely in the way people holding society&#x27;s ethical and political reigns disdain and disregard the <i>mere facts</i> uncovered by science and mathematics in favor of their ever-more-sophisticated &quot;humanistic&quot; intuitions.",1424108956

Some relevant research/articles:&quot;<p>and then three study links with the first one being a study with the line &quot;Contrary to immunity elicited by influenza vaccination, naturally acquired immunity can provide long-lasting protection against subsequent infection by the same viral subtype [22, 23]. For example, when the A(H1N1) virus re-emerged in 1977 after 20 years, people who had been exposed to the virus before 1957 were much less susceptible to infection than those born after 1957 [24].

9057959,comment,9057126,9057126,0,0,graycat,,,"Why?  Drawing from my experience learning
some technical material, I will 
give some candidate answers:<p>(1) Content.  From what I&#x27;ve seen of MOOCs
in some areas where I know some things, 
usually the content looks poor just on 
the subject itself and/or its presentation,
i.e., too many of the lectures are just poorly
done in any common sense of good lectures.
E.g., start in the upper, left corner of
the board and write clearly, clearly enough
so that a student can take essentially perfect
notes.<p>(2) Purpose.  Commonly the courses do not have
a sufficiently clear and meaningful <i>purpose</i>
for enough candidate students.<p>E.g., why study calculus?  What MOOCs provide
a really clear answer meaningful even to
most of the people who consider a course in
calculus?<p>E.g., why&#x27;d I study calculus?
In., in grades 1-8 I got dumped on by the
teachers; those teachers wanted to
teach to the girls with their
better handwriting, better verbal 
talent and skills,
better clerical talent,
better insight
into fictional literature, and much
better classroom <i>decorum</i>.  I
wanted, strongly beyond belief, to
know how <i>things</i> worked, and the
girls were little masters at knowing
how the teachers <i>worked</i>!<p>In grade 9 I discovered I could
do math, i.e., <i>algebra</i> and fairly easily
could lead the class.  Essentially all the
girls in the class, all of whom had
effortlessly blown me away in grades 1-8 
now were struggling while I was having
a great time, easily.<p>I got sent to a
math tournament.  That success continued
in grades 10-12.  In the 11th grade, I
saw the same for physics -- could usually
have my head down in class, resting, and
still be one of the best students in the
class -- of mostly 12th graders,
three of whom went to Princeton and
ran against each other and some fourth
sucker for President of the freshman
class.  I got sent to an NSF math and
physics summer program.<p>So, in college, I was <i>hot to go</i> in
math and quickly went through the
course catalog and planned all the 
math courses I would have for all four
years.  I really liked math!<p>But to save money, I did my freshman college
year at a state school, inexpensive, I 
could walk to.  They forced me into a
course in <i>college algebra</i> beneath what 
I&#x27;d already done in high school
(by far the best in the city, e.g.,
the three guys who went to Princeton;
MIT came recruiting; a guy I beat in
a shootout at the board in trig class
went to MIT).  A girl told me when
the tests were, and I showed up only for
those.<p>But, I knew that as a freshman 
I was supposed to be learning
calculus and was <i>torqued</i> that I
was not.  So I got the recommended
calculus book and dug in.  In grades
9-12 I&#x27;d learned mostly just from the
book so also was able to do well working
through the calculus book, totally 
independently.<p>I did well:  E.g.,
I had quite nice college board scores,
especially in math and physics,
so, the next year (we had a little more
money) I got into
a good four year college.<p>So, where to start there in math?
Okay, I asked to start with just their
sophomore calculus.  They said that
they couldn&#x27;t give me credit for
first year calculus, but that was totally
fine with me.  The text they used was the
same as Harvard used; it was good.
I did fine -- made As, loved the material,
had fun, didn&#x27;t work at it very hard.
Right:  I was a math major but never
really took a course in freshman calculus!<p>Also blew away everyone in their freshman
physics course -- first test had four
questions; I got all four; no other
student got more than two; tree counted
as 100; so I got 133; and I never missed
anything for the rest of the semester
so ended up with 33 points over a perfect
score.  The second semester, missed only
one test question.<p>Went on and got honors
in math, got a Ph.D. in applied
math (stochastic optimal control),
have had math much of my career, and now
have some original math I derived as the
crucial core technology for my search engine
start up.  Lesson:  I&#x27;ve had a
<i>purpose</i> in mind learning math.<p>So, I did learn calculus, just on my own
for freshman calculus.  So, why?  Sure:
(a) Motivation.  I really, really, really
wanted to know the material, not just a little
bit but a lot.  (b) Resources.  I had plenty
of time to do the work.  (c) Preparation.
The four years of math I took in high
school gave me about everything one could
want in prerequisites for calculus.
(d) While I didn&#x27;t know much about just
what I would do with calculus or math
after college, I did believe that they
should help my career, and I knew that,
for math, calculus was one of the biggies.<p>Okay, for the MOOCs, if
have (a)-(d) and some good materials, then
lots of students should do well.
If are not having many students are doing well,
then look first at (a)-(d) and the
materials.  From what I&#x27;ve seen,
too commonly the course materials
are not very good.<p>E.g., for calculus, from what I&#x27;ve seen,
it appears that the courses want to
imply the a person can learn calculus
easily as a <i>spectator</i> (sport) watching videos
instead of doing the work studying good
materials, say, a good text.  I doubt
that many students could learn calculus
as a spectator sport.<p>There really can be opportunities for
people to learn outside a classroom,
and online materials can help.
But need good materials, likely including
a good, traditional text book, and
also need, say, (a)-(d) above.<p>By the way, as a math grad student, I 
taught calculus successfully.  As an
MBA prof, I taught more in applied math
successfully.  In my career, I continued
to learn on my own:  E.g., for some weeks
I carried Blackman and Tukey, <i>The Measurement
of Power Spectra</i> to dinner at a seafood
bar in Silver Spring, MD, and then one week,
mostly on my own without my company
knowing about it,
wrote some corresponding software which
was a big help in our company winning
a competitive software development
contract -- my work on power spectra
estimation had in effect given our company
<i>sole source</i>.<p>Lesson 1:  Math can
make money.<p>Lesson 2: It is possible
to do the work of math making money
mostly via independent study.<p>Lesson 3:
I doubt that any of the MOOCs will
cover how to measure power spectra, say,
with the fast Fourier transform (FFT)!<p>How about a continuous
time, discrete state space Markov process
subordinated to a Poisson process?  
Make money with that?  Did that once.
Covered well in a MOOC?  I doubt it!<p>I used to look at MOOCs, wanted to learn
more about, 
say, stochastic processes in continuous
time, say, like in Gihman and Skorohod or
Lipster and Shiryayev
or
Karatzas and Shreve.
Gee, I didn&#x27;t find much!<p>There is high irony here:
This is Hacker News, and my view is that
nearly all the learning crucial for the
current US <i>information technology</i>
industry, especially the software part of it,
has been from essentially just independent
study.  So, the irony is that the
readers of Hacker News should be
about the best audience for MOOCs.<p>E.g., for a while in my career, 
when I was fairly deep into computing but
before I&#x27;d ever had a course in
computing or computer science,
I taught several sections
of <i>computer science</i> at Georgetown
University.  Later in grad school,
I was pushed to take a course in
<i>computer science</i> -- not much past
what I&#x27;d taught at Georgetown!  At
one point, sure, the course tried
to cover quicksort.  Okay, worthwhile
for such a course!
But I&#x27;d long since learned quicksort,
heap sort, Shell sort, bubble sort,
merge sort, etc. from some original papers and
Knuth&#x27;s <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>,
programmed all those that were <i>in-place</i> sort
algorithms, compared their performance,
programmed some special purpose versions,
etc.  So, during the course, I just
watched and smiled.  Gee, they neglected
to mention that in the <i>bit reversed</i>
permutation from some of the
versions of the fast Fourier transform,
Shell sort does nothing at all until
the last pass at which time it runs
in O(N^2)!  Gee, why didn&#x27;t they
mention that one!<p>Lesson:  It&#x27;s possible to
do well in computing and computer science
with independent
study.<p>Surprise:  One of the profs in that
course didn&#x27;t like me and gave me a grade of
C.  I appealed to the department,
pointed to some code I&#x27;d submitted
in my application to the department,
the code I&#x27;d written to schedule the
fleet at FedEx, the code I&#x27;d written
for power spectral estimation, etc.,
and the next year that prof was gone!<p>Lesson:  If the Hacker News audience is
not doing well with MOOCs, then blame
the MOOCs, not the students!",1424107653

If all research was funded by non-profit public interest groups, there might be more trust, but when you&#x27;re talking about GMO research, for example, a lot of it is done by industry for industry. I&#x27;m not saying that all GMOs are bad, but it&#x27;s also impossible to make a blanket statement that all GMOs are good. Obviously that&#x27;s not the case.<p>A GMO could be created to be extremely dangerous, just like a prescription medicine could and has been created which is extremely dangerous. The problem is that we&#x27;re asked to trust people whose immediate interests do not always align with ours. We&#x27;ve seen prescriptions forced through with inadequate testing, so there&#x27;s no reason to believe that every GMO is going to be adequately tested.

Huge numbers of initial settlers will die. The task of carving out a life in a barren lifeless radiation-soaked desert will demand the same level of fanatical, all-encompassing zeal. It will be, in short, a <i>crusade</i>, only the adversary will be the environment rather than another group of people. It would even have an &quot;apocalyptic&quot; character. I can imagine the settlers&#x27; picturing a future blue Mars -- the eschatological promised land -- and resolving that it will be this, or death.<p>We create because we are not content. Our perpetual discontent is the source of pretty much everything admirable about us. But when we can&#x27;t create? When no positive avenue is available?<p>Picture yourself as an ambitious visionary personality in a failed client state like Iraq. What realistically can you do? Labor for your puppet state? Pay protection money to gangsters? You hear tales of torture, then learn some of them are true. If a drone pilot screws up and kills your family, it will be written off as an acceptable loss... assuming it&#x27;s acknowledged at all. The message you receive from the world is clear. You have no value. Your death is acceptable. You are worthless.<p>We are not domesticated animals. People are not content to be worthless. You cannot humiliate and grind down human beings without consequence. If no other avenues are available they won&#x27;t go quietly.

Stupidly wrong.<p>This is actually one of the reasons there&#x27;s such resistance to science I think. These people are actually expressing a very scientific mentality: that we are not totally certain of the consequences of our influence on a complex system. Yet the response is <i>absolute,</i> which is arguably very unscientific!<p>Sure, they don&#x27;t respond to it in the right way, and the discussions are never as nuanced or knowledgable as they should be, but they are fundamentally right about the fact that even science leaves room for doubt and uncertainty. They just don&#x27;t fully understand why. Yes, we need better science education for the masses, and yes their perspective is fallacious individually, but as you say, it&#x27;s not their fault. There&#x27;s a systemic issue here.<p>Ironically, and perhaps impossibly, we still need to validate this mentality, because it is actually mostly right. We should be doubting science. We should be questioning data presented to us. We should not treat all things that appear equal on the surface as the same without demanding a deeper understanding and evidence. These concepts are correct, the process is correct, and people are being lambasted and called <i>stupid</i> for it. These people are often extremely intelligent for thinking those thoughts, even if their macro scale conclusions are not (even though, at times, they are).<p>Instead, we should encourage that type of thinking—and guide it. Yes! You&#x27;re right! We&#x27;re not 100% certain. But here&#x27;s why that&#x27;s okay. Thank you for doubting. Thank you for recognizing uncertainty in the face of complexity. Thank you for being complete in your understanding, because here&#x27;s all the data. Thank you for trusting us—let&#x27;s keep working together.<p>So I agree with you; we need that trust. But what nurtures trust? Is it calling people &quot;stupidly wrong,&quot; or is it recognizing their motivations and addressing them with a human understanding? And why aren&#x27;t we doing that?<p>I just get the sense that in the face of the truth, we&#x27;re approaching this problem in a profoundly wrong way, and the societal vitriol and information problem is actually becoming a public health consequence.

There&#x27;s also Agnotology - &quot;culturally induced ignorance&quot;, which is important to understand (and deal with) in the context of this topic.<p>There is, however, another reason, which may be less obvious than the above. It applies to people who do, in fact, know better, but maintain laughable/ignorant/ridiculous positions about issues regardless. Let&#x27;s call them &quot;Future Policy Fearers.&quot; There was a brilliant comment on Less Wrong (<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ph/youre_entitled_to_arguments_but_not_that/1mdz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ph/youre_entitled_to_arguments_but_...</a>) that sums this view up perfectly (this particular example uses climate change/AGW, but it could be about Creationism/Evolution or a hundred other things):<p>&quot;It becomes a signaling game, in which each choice of belief will be understood as exactly how you would communicate a particular choice of political move, and the costs of making the wrong political move feel very high. So the belief decisions and the political actions become tangled up.
Roughly, people have no way of saying:<p>&#x27;I believe that in terms of pure decision theory, the predicted AGW damage and costs of further investigation and costs of delay are high enough that mitigation attempts should start now. But I don&#x27;t want to give up my {economic privileges / substantive national sovereignty / chance to get the standard of living of past carbon-emitting nations} without a fight, because I don&#x27;t want groups in the future like {scientists / profit-hating hippie tree-huggers / freedom-hating U.N. environmental bureaucrats / greedy unfair first-world hypocrites} to think I&#x27;ll just roll over when they try to impose concessions on me, in the name of premises that will feel psychologically as though they might just as well have been made up. In that future situation, it will be important for me to be able to credibly threaten outrage at being forced into such concessions. But as long as nobody else is going to take me for their fool, the sacrifices needed to prevent AGW are fine with me; we could start today.&#x27;<p>So instead, they say: &#x27;I believe that the case for AGW isn&#x27;t strong enough. I demand clearer proof.&#x27;<p>If it were possible to negotiate separately about AGW action and about precedents of policy concessions to e.g. scientists&#x27; claims, then you might see less decision-theoretic insanity around the AGW action question itself.&quot;<p>This group is just as important when dealing with perceived ignorance as those who are victims of Agnotology. Their actions and positions act as a proxy for a future power struggle, and should be understood as such.",1424107369

9057790,comment,9054753,9054753,0,0,markbnj,,,"&quot;Get ready to interact?&quot; I don&#x27;t think the average human resident of the year 2015 needs to be prompted to think of an information display as interactive. You might need to warn them if your site _isn&#x27;t_ interactive. Anyway, two main thoughts: first, extremely annoying audio environment; second, chasing the fireball to click it to get a different view is a very odd choice of mechanism. Overall this approach, in my view, doesn&#x27;t make the information about the event easier to find, view, or understand, and that&#x27;s the only thing that really matters.",1424106032

Links?</i><p>Any university with a neuroscience department does this. Go to your local university&#x27;s website and browse what they&#x27;re doing in that area: more likely than not you&#x27;ll find something interesting. Basic research on neurons has become very common, and computer-based modeling is a fundamental part of it. The perception problem here is that, say, modeling the signaling behavior of locust neurons seems like a very inconsequential piece of the puzzle - but in reality it&#x27;s what we need to do to figure this stuff out.<p>The fundamental problem in neuroscience research is not a lack of complexity, for now we need to move away from complexity in order to observe the behavior of basic building blocks. It may seem embarrassing how we&#x27;re still at that stage, but it&#x27;s where we stand.",1424106028

You should factor this in to any change.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in start ups and large companies. I quickly realized that I could make more money consulting/contracting for large companies, than working for either. This is at the sacrifice of not doing the most interesting work. If money wasn&#x27;t an issue I&#x27;d love to do a start up again.",1424106015

I never got a good answer when I said<p>> I don't care about the signal towers or how old the system is. The point is that the technology for identifying the location and speed of a few hundred giant hunks of metal moving around on fixed tracks is trivial and does not need to interact with the old system (or humans) at all. Just tag each train with a few RFID's, and stick in a few hundred miles of wiring into the tunnels.<p>>I mean, are you telling me for a 100 million dollars this couldn't be done?<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4979988"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4979988</a><p>The context was this:<p>> The existence of this sleek digital interface barely hints at the investment that had to be made in terms of hardware and infrastructure to make this enormous public benefit a reality, said Thomas F. Prendergast, President of MTA New York City Transit. Think of Subway Time as the small tip of a huge iceberg. For a product of this quality to be available on the lettered lines, we will need to commit hundreds of millions of dollars and years of dedicated effort.<p>> Automatic Train Supervision installation began in 1997. The system was activated in segments, with the substantial completion taking place in 2008.

You're on a business trip, for example. A cab driver asks if you have kids, and you say that you do. Then he asks about your wife. Even though you may be exhausted, you find yourself summoning the energy to have a transformative conversation with a total stranger on whom you are depending to get to the airport and whose reaction you have no way of predicting.</i><p>The author's own situation is clouding his judgement.  It is entirely easy to predict that asking if you have kids is going to lead to asking about a wife.  This is the way family life has gone on for centuries.  It's only recently (in generational terms) that gay couples could adopt children or even be openly gay and married... yet the author thinks that there's no way to predict how someone is going to steer a conversation.  I wouldn't take offense if someone steered a conversation in the wrong way because it's more about their reaction to the surprise news (""oh, i have a husband not a wife"") than to how the conversation found itself.  Maybe I perhaps steered the conversation the wrong way instead of the cab driver.<p>As an aside: I had to rewrite this many times because I didn't want to come off as being homophobic, discriminatory, or what have you.

This in turn makes reimplementing your own Lisp, inline in Lisp, similarly trivial.<p>That sounds like something out of an SICP exercise - and it is - but the same properties make it easier to reason about your code in a way that's <i>far</i> more abstract than other languages let you.

Second, the state-of-the-art for libraries in the 1990s was, if nothing else, less Big.

This isn't something you're likely to notice unless you do a lot of heavy metaprogramming.<p>Clojure cannot guarantee elimination of tail calls, because of the limitations of the underlying JVM. This also means that it can't properly handle corecursion in the same way that pretty much every single other Lisp can.<p>(Both of these have been discussed before many times before on HN, so I can pre-empt the next comment in this thread, which will be someone pointing out that Clojure provides ""loop"" and the ""recur"" macro - to which I'd respond, yes, they're logically equivalent in the end, but having to force the transformation to a loop explicitly breaks the paradigm, which for me is the whole point of using a Lisp. This is one of those topics that can be discussed ad nauseum with no ""conclusion"", so it's not worth spending too much time on it.)<p>Lastly, anytime you're dealing with binary compatibility between various JVM languages, the abstraction is inherently a bit leaky. I haven't used Clojure myself, so I can't comment specifically there, but from my experience with using Java libraries in Scala, I can testify that some of the warts of Java end up leaking into Scala code. Nothing debilitating, just a bit frustrating[1].<p>[0] Racket does too, but the ""syntax"" added (square brackets) has the same semantics, so it's really just an equivalent token - an alias, if you will.<p>[1] One particular example I remember has to do with how Foo.class in Java works, and how a library dependent on this particular pattern has to be used in Scala - it just gets a bit messy.",1357746507

That doesn't directly affect the popularity of the language; it's quite possible to do things in Arc without using closures for state on the web.<p>I played around with Arc quite a bit and the biggest problem was that it did not have a standard library with enough stuff in it. In contrast (and talking about a totally different type of language) one of the reasons Go has been successful is the excellent set of standard packages.<p>If you start your language with sufficient standard library kindling then others can build on that and write more and more libraries. But start with insufficient libraries and it's hard to take off.<p>So, the initial releases of Arc were constrained by things that PG had already written. If you wanted to do the same then it was just fine.<p>As as concrete example I wanted on my old UseTheSource site (which was in Arc) to go grab a URL from a third-party site inside the code. There wasn't an easy way to do that so I wrote an external script in Perl and did the following in Arc:<p><pre><code>  (def hn-valid (user)\n    (if (uvar user hn)\n          t\n          (let v (system (+ ""perl check-hn.pl "" user))\n                  (if v (= ((profile user) 'hn) t))\n                  v)))\n</code></pre>\nThe Perl script grabbed a page on Hacker News, did some light parsing and returned either 0 or 1. That really put me off making any extra effort to use Arc (and I like Lispy languages) because I was either going to shell out to something else, or have to write <i>everything</i> from the ground up.<p>A similar thing happened with UseTheSource's Twitter integration where I could use Perl's Net::Twitter::Lite to trivially integrate.",1357746108

5031941,comment,5030803,5031622,13,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Imperative programs read like English. Functional ones read like Apache.<p>The Main difference is, a functional programs mainly talks about what things <i>are</i>, not what they <i>do</i>.  For instance:<p><pre><code>  // C(++)\n  int square(int n)\n  {\n    return n * n;\n  }\n\n  -- Haskell\n  square :: Int -> Int\n  square n = n * n\n</code></pre>\nThe C code reads like a procedure to follow: ""return n times n to whoever called you"" (I'm anthropomorphising square(), here).  The Haskell code reads like a description: ""the square of n is n times n"".<p>That was the first major difficulty.  Now the second one: functional code is often like reversed imperative code:<p><pre><code>  // C(++)\n  int compute(int n)\n  {\n    int x = foo(n);\n    int y = bar(x);\n    int z = baz(y);\n    return z;\n  }\n\n  -- Haskell\n  compute :: Int -> Int\n  compute n = baz (bar (foo n))\n\n  -- alternate definition\n  compute n = baz . bar . foo $ n\n    where g . f = \x -> g (f x) -- function composition\n          f $ x = f x           -- function application\n</code></pre>\nSo, in the Haskell code, you see that the data flows from right to left, instead of top to bottom.  Like Unix pipes, only reversed.<p>The final difficulty is getting used to the fact that functions are passed around <i>directly</i>.  In C++, Java, or Python, we often pass around <i>objects</i>, who may or may not hold the same methods than the others that where passed around in the same way (that's polymorphism).  Subtype polymorphism is neat, but most often, you need it because you want <i>one</i> method to change depending on various factors.  A simpler way to do this is pass around the function directly.<p>That leads to some powerful, though uncommon in the imperative world, idioms.  For instance, you can write your own customized loops.  Imagine for instance that you want to process lists in Haskell:<p><pre><code>                                -- A List is either\n  data List a = Empty           -- an empty node,\n              | Cons a (List a) -- or a cons cell,\n                                -- with an element and a list.\n</code></pre>\nNow let's process the list<p><pre><code>  inc-all :: List Int -> List Int\n  inc-all Empty      = Empty\n  inc-all (Cons e l) = Cons (foo e + 1) (inc-all l)\n\n  dbl-all :: List Int -> List Int\n  dbl-all Empty      = Empty\n  dbl-all (Cons e l) = Cons (foo e * e) (inc-all l)\n</code></pre>\nSee how much they have in common? There's a way to factor out that, with a map:<p><pre><code>  map (a -> b) -> List a -> list b\n  map f Empty      = Empty\n  map f (Cons e l) = Cons (f e) (map f l)\n</code></pre>\nNote that the first argument is a function, hence the (a->b) between parentheses.  Using it is very simple:<p><pre><code>  inc-all l = map (e -> e + 1) l\n  dbl-all l = map (e -> e * e) l\n</code></pre>\nAnd Haskell can make it even more concise, with what we call partial application. Haskell functions actually have only one argument.  Multiple arguments are simulated by having the function return another function. Here:<p><pre><code>  add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)\n  add x = y -> (x + y)\n</code></pre>\nWhich is the same as:<p><pre><code>  add :: Int -> Int -> Int\n  add x y = x + y\n</code></pre>\nOr even<p><pre><code>  add :: Int -> Int -> Int\n  add = x -> (y -> (x + y))\n</code></pre>\nSo, inc-all and dbl-all above can be written as:<p><pre><code>  inc-all = map (e -> e + 1)\n  dbl-all = map (e -> e * e)\n</code></pre>\nWithout those fundamentals, one doesn't stand a chance at understanding real world functional code.  It's just too different.  It's no harder, though.  The main difficulty here is to change your mindset.<p>Now I haven't talked about macros",1357745448

Large scale environments with heterogeneity have approaches available like desktop virtualization or app containerization that ensure apps can be packaged in a self-contained way so that there's less need for full-OS control.<p>Secondly, your remote wipe scenario makes no sense.  If the device is stolen, you WANT your personal stuff wiped too!   The root issue is highlighted by your re-imaging scenario:  lack of regular, automated network backups.  But that has very little to do with ownership amd control, and everything to do with the backup service quality and user training.<p>2.  You're absolutely right about compatibility, but you'll notice the dodge to the original point.  ""Security"" was defined as the reason for the use of a certain browser, not ""Stadardization"".   Which we both know is horseshit - IE 6 has been long deprecated , unsupported, and a massive security hole, for example, to the point that its just budgetary negligence to keep insisting on that version.  But again we get to ""why hate IT"" - its not standardization in reason, it's lying to your customers to cover up poor service.<p>4.  I've run ops for multi tens-of-thousands of desktop environments and I have rarely seen that level of sign off required for non-standard applications except in highly secured (classified) contexts.   It's draconian and unnecessary.  Also note the misdirection: draconian approvals have little to do with ""this requires documentation"", it has to do with ""preventing change"".  Of course exceptions require documentation, and at least line managerial approval, but requiring senior  approval is a big red neon sign that the stated policy of the organization is ""fuck change"", rather than ""embrace change and manage risk"".<p>Finally, to your point:<p>""The specific program is not the issue. IT in the enterprise is all about centralized/standardized management and configuration. Every deviation from the standard is gonna increase the burden of maintenance.""<p>I agree with the first part.  The latter part is where I say ""that's the cost of doing business"".  The problem we have with much of old IT today is an operations-penny-pinching ""change is bad and our processes are designed to prevent it"" mentality rather than a balance between delivering new value and keeping it running, where ""change is the norm and our processes are designed to manage it"".<p>Look man, I get where you're coming from, but after dealing with senior business execs for a long while, I feel IT-as-is is untenable.   without a rethink,  the abject hatred that many business people have towards IT will grow and rogue systems will flourish.  Its like the PC days of 1983 agajn.  The price to be paid by technology professionals for this acrimony will be large, similar to what mainframe professionals went through.",1357745387

Rising powers are jostling for position in the four corners of the world, some seeking a new place for themselves within the current global order, others questioning its very legitimacy. Democracy and despotism are locked in uneasy competition. A world economy is interconnected as never before by flows of money, trade, and people, and by the unprecedented spread of new, distance-destroying technologies. A global society, perhaps even a global moral consciousness, is emerging as a result. Small-town America rails at the excessive power of Wall Street. Asia is rising once again. And, yes, there's trouble in the Middle East.<p>COMMENTS (0)\nSHARE:<p>Share on twitter Twitter<p>Share on reddit Reddit<p>More...\nSound familiar?<p>In many ways, the world of 1913, the last year before the Great War, seems not so much the world of 100 years ago as the world of today, curiously refracted through time. It is impossible to look at it without an uncanny feeling of recognition, telescoping a century into the blink of an eye. But can peering back into the world of our great-grandparents really help us understand the world we live in today?<p>Let's get the caveats out of the way upfront. History does not repeat itself -- at least not exactly. Analogies from one period to another are never perfect. However tempting it may be to view China in 2013 as an exact parallel to Germany in 1913 (the disruptive rising power of its age) or to view the contemporary United States as going through the exact same experience as Britain a century ago (a ""weary titan staggering under the too vast orb of its fate,"" as Joseph Chamberlain put it), things are never quite that straightforward. Whereas Germany in 1913 explicitly sought a foreign empire, China in 2013 publicly eschews the idea that it is an expansionist power (though it is perfectly clear about protecting its interests around the world). Whereas the German empire in 1913 had barely 40 years of history as a unified state behind it and was only slightly more populous that Britain or France, China in 2013 can look back on centuries of continuous history as a player in world affairs, and it now boasts one-fifth of the world's population. Whereas Germany's rise was a genuinely new geopolitical phenomenon in 1913, the rise of China today is more of a return to historical normality. These differences matter.<p>Similarly, the strengths and weaknesses of the United States in 2013 are not quite the same as those of Britain 100 years ago. Then, Britain benefited politically from being the world's banker and from being the linchpin of the gold standard. Today the United States, though benefiting politically and economically from being the issuer of the world's principal reserve currency, is hardly in the same position: The country is laden with debt. (One can argue about whether it should really be such a big issue that so much of that debt is owned by Chinese state entities -- after all, Beijing can't just dump Treasury bonds if it doesn't get what it wants from Washington. But Chinese ownership of U.S. debt feeds a perception of American decline, and perceptions of the relative powers of states matter a lot to how other countries treat them.) There are other differences between Britain in 1913 and the United States in 2013. Britain was never a military superpower on the order of the United States today. There was never a unipolar British moment. Britain in 1913 had slipped behind Germany industrially decades before, living more and more off the proceeds of the past; the United States in 2013 is still the world's largest economy and in many respects the most dynamic and most innovative.<p>Moreover, the global context in which powers rise and fall in the 21st century is not quite the same as the one of the early 20th. In 1913, a handful of empires, mostly European, ruled over most of the world. Only two countries in Africa -- Ethiopia and Liberia -- could claim to be truly independent. In 2013, the United Nations counts over 190 independent states among its membership. Fifty-two of these are African. In 1913, one in four of the world's people lived in Europe; now it's less than one in 10. And the web of international laws and institutions that bind the world together is much thicker now than it was 100 years ago, though it shouldn't be forgotten that the Hague conventions on the laws of war date from before World War I, while the forerunner of the International Court of Justice opened its doors to the world in -- you guessed it -- 1913.<p>But the fact that historical analogies are imperfect -- and the analogy between 1913 and 2013 is far from being seamless -- does not make them useless. It simply means that they need to be interpreted with care. As Mark Twain put it: ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme."" The task is to listen for those rhymes and to calibrate our hearing to catch them.<p>In the end, the utility of history to the decision-maker or to the policy analyst is not as a stock of neatly packaged lessons for the contemporary world, to be pulled off the shelf and applied formulaically to every situation. Rather, it is to hone a way of thinking about change and continuity, contingency and chance. Thinking historically can remind us of the surprises that can knock states and societies off course and, at the same time, can check our enthusiasm for believing that this time is different. The world of 1913, on the threshold of the seminal catastrophe of the 20th century yet by and large not expecting it, is a case in point. Sure, there is such a sin as misusing history -- abusing history, even. But there is a much worse mistake: imagining that we have escaped it.<p>Technology is a common culprit here. It is often remarked that we live in an era of superfast, hypertransformative technological innovation, when history, as Henry Ford put it, is bunk. When innovation comes packaged in the form of a shiny new iPhone -- the subatomic functioning of which seems pretty close to magic -- it is easy to succumb to the technofantasy that we live in an entirely new age, a new era, quite unlike anything that has come before. Yet radical technological change is hardly new. The world of 1913 had its own revolutionary technologies. Radio telegraphy was being introduced, with the promise of improving the safety of shipping at sea and allowing market and strategic information to be pinged around the globe without the need for wires. Automobiles were coming off the world's first production line -- Ford's Highland Park plant in Detroit -- and being shipped around the world, including, in 1913, to the Buddhist monks of Mongolia. Oil was replacing coal to fuel the British Royal Navy -- the world's largest -- pushing the Admiralty to go into the oil business in southern Iran and inaugurating modern petroleum diplomacy in the Middle East. The first feature-length Hollywood movie began shooting at the end of the year, and the first Indian film reached cinemas in Bombay. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson even used a campaign film in the presidential election of the previous year. (Its theme would be well suited to 2013: Tax the rich.)<p>In the end, technological advances, remarkable in themselves, change things much more than we can ever expect -- the speed of adoption of new technologies is hard to predict, and the second- or third-order impacts of adoption even less so -- but also much less. However new the technology, it is ultimately being grafted onto the rather old technology of the individual human, or the community, or the state. And even the newest of technologies can be manipulated for the oldest of ends. It took less than 10 years from the Wright brothers' first flight, a truly revolutionary and liberating event in the history of humanity, to the first use of aircraft to conduct aerial bombing: over the cities of Libya in 1911 and over the Balkans in 1912 and 1913. Similarly, while the Internet was hailed 20 years ago as a force for the liberation of oppressed people around the world -- and indeed many people still see it that way -- authoritarian states have begun to wise up too. At the end of 2012, a rogues' gallery of authoritarian states tried to use a U.N. conference to advance an agenda of much tighter state control of the Internet internationally. Domestically, such states are already using aspects of the Internet to contain or watch their people. The world's second-oldest profession -- espionage -- has rapidly adapted itself to operations in the open, online world. Technology may be a driver of historical change, but it is subject to historical context too.<p>To the historically minded, the recurrence of particular themes, or particular rhymes, through history -- human greed, the manipulation of technology, the importance of geography in determining military outcomes, the power of belief in shaping politics, a solid conviction that this time is different -- is no surprise. You thought that the debt-fueled boom of the 2000s was different from all those other booms throughout history? Wrong. The ancient Greeks, with their understanding of greed, self-deception, hubris, and nemesis, would have been quite able to interpret the 2008 financial crisis without the need for an advanced degree in financial astrophysics from Harvard Business School. You thought pacifying Afghanistan would be a piece of cake because we have laser-guided munitions and drones these days? Not so much. You think that globalization is destined to continue forever, that interstate war is impossible, and that the onward march of democracy is ineluctable? Hang on a second; isn't that what people thought in 1913?<p>The crucial point about the world 100 years ago, then, is not that it is identical to the world today -- it isn't -- but that there was a time, in the not-so-distant past, when a globalized world, not entirely dissimilar to our own, fell apart. And it wasn't because human societies were in the grip of the uncontrollable forces of destiny or that they were particularly dumb. Most just didn't expect things to pan out the way they did. People actually living through the year 1913 did not experience those 12 months as the moody prelude to catastrophe. In retrospect, there were storm clouds on the horizon. But at the time, many people found themselves living through the best of times -- or simply had other things to think about.<p>The world in 1913 was dynamic, modern, interconnected, smart -- just like ours. 1913 was the year that the modern European art of the Armory Show conquered New York. It was the year the United States established the Federal Reserve, the essential precondition for the global financial power that it would later become, in much the same way that the emergence of the Chinese renminbi as a globally traded currency today is laying the groundwork for a Chinese challenge to American financial supremacy tomorrow. 1913 was the year Gandhi made a name for himself as a political agitator in South Africa, the year Australians laid the foundation for their new capital city, the year Russian Ballets Russes took the capitals of Europe by storm -- and then did the same in Buenos Aires, then one of the richest and fastest-growing cities on Earth. In 1913, China assembled its first democratically assembled parliament, weeks after the leader of its largest party, Song Jiaoren, had been assassinated -- a murder that perhaps changed the course of global history as much as the far more famous killing of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo a year later. In 1913, Lenin was living in exile in the mountains of Galicia; Russia was in the middle of an industrial boom, with many believing that the moment of maximum revolutionary danger had passed and that the Tsarist Empire was on its way to becoming the dominant Eurasian power. In 1913, Japan -- a country that in 60 years had gone from being a hermit empire to an expansive, industrializing Asian nation, recognized as a peer by the other great powers -- was dealing with the uncertainties of a new emperor on the throne and mourning the death of the last shogun. In the last year before the Great War, Germany was Britain's second-largest trading partner, leading many in the City of London -- and across Europe -- to conclude that, despite the rise of Anglo-German antagonism over naval armaments, a war between the two was unlikely. If the international solidarity of the workers did not stop a war, the self-interest of global finance would, it was argued.<p>Of course, there were prognosticators of gloom and doom in 1913 -- just as there are in any era. But there were plenty of seasoned observers of the world then who saw the processes of internationalization all around them -- of everything from the measurement of time to the laws of war -- as the natural unfolding of history's grand plan. ""No country, no continent any longer lives an independent life,"" wrote G.P. Gooch, a British historian, in 1913. ""As the world contracts the human race grows more conscious of its unity. Ideas, ideals, and experiments make the tour of the globe. Civilisation has become international."" Many noted that economic globalization made war unprofitable; some thought it made it impossible. In 1913, as in previous years, an international exhibition was held to commemorate the advances of the world toward greater integration -- held in Belgium this time, in a city that would quake with the sound of artillery shells within a year. In 1913, German Kaiser Wilhelm II was viewed by some as a peacemaker. A few years earlier, president of the University of California/Berkeley had nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.<p>What does any of this say about the world in 2013?<p>Not that we are on the cusp of a new Great War and that, on reading this, you should head for the hills and hope for the best. There is nothing inevitable about future conflict between the great powers and there is nothing foretold about the collapse of global trade -- though I would argue that both are substantially more likely now than 10 years ago. But looking at the world of 1913 reminds us that there is nothing immutable about the continuity of globalization either, and certainly nothing immutable about the Western-oriented globalization of the last few decades.<p>There are plenty of distinct and plausible shocks to the system that could knock our expectations of the future wildly off course -- and plenty of surprises that we can neither predict nor anticipate, but that we can indirectly prepare for by attuning ourselves to the possibility of their occurrence. To take an example of one of the more plausible shocks we now face, a miscalculation in the South China Sea could easily set off a chain of events not entirely dissimilar to a shot in Sarajevo in 1914, with alliance structures, questions of prestige, escalation, credibility, and military capability turning what should be marginal to global affairs into a central question of war and peace.<p>In a general sense, while the United States in 2013 may not be a perfect analogue for Britain in 1913 (nor China in 2013 a perfect analogue for Germany in 1913), it is certainly the case that the world we are now entering is more similar to that of 100 years ago -- a world of competitive multipolarity -- than that of a quarter-century ago. Just as in 1913, technology, trade, and finance bind the world together now -- and rational self-interest would suggest that the integration that these forces have brought about is irreversible. Yet, over the last few years, the world has witnessed a rise in trade protection, a breakdown in global trade negotiations, totally inadequate progress on global climate discussions, and moves to fragment the Internet. There is a corrosive and self-fulfilling sense that the dominance of the West -- as the world's rule-maker and pace-setter -- is over.<p>Humanity is forever condemned to live with uncertainty about the future. But thinking historically equips us to better gauge that uncertainty, to temper biases, question assumptions, and stretch our imagination. By understanding the history of other countries -- particularly those that are re-emerging to global eminence now -- we might better understand their mindsets, hopes, and fears. And when we've done that, we might find we need to think again about how to build a future of our own making, rather than one decided for us by events.<p>The world of 1913 -- brilliant, dynamic, interdependent -- offers a warning. The operating system of the world in that year was taken by many for granted. In 2013, at a time of similar global flux, the biggest mistake we could possibly make is to assume that the operating system of our own world will continue indefinitely, that all we need to do is stroll into the future, and that the future will inevitably be what we want it to be. Those comforting times are over. We need to prepare ourselves for a much rougher ride ahead.",1357744981

Totally unrelated to hype or to this article or to anything -- the reason why was mostly the challenges that came with switching to js. The two challenges that particularly intrigued me were:<p>- Making async code clean, readable, and manageable. As <i>themgt</i> mentioned, this is a really tough challenge. It took me months of going over and over my code, continually reading about promises and async flow control etc. to really ""get it"". And once I got it, it was really empowering, and the ability and choice to run pieces of code in parallel or in series (which you don't get at all with sync languages) is something I'm now very reluctant to give up.<p>- Writing code that has more syntax (braces, semicolons, low level loops, etc) and still making it clean and readable is a challenge that I think has improved the way I write <i>all</i> code for the better. It's so much more difficult to make javascript adhere to the cleanliness standards that I'm used to with ruby that I spend a lot more time thinking about how elegant and readable my code is and optimizing it for that purpose, which I think nobody would argue is a great thing for a developer to work on.<p>So without comment on whether javascript is ""the"" language or ""the future"", which, as other people have mentioned, is silly to speculate, I would strongly recommend picking up node and using it to build a few apps, if just for the purpose of dealing with the two points I mentioned above : )",1357744381

Note that I took this example because it's on the top of my mind, but I am sure similar proves of interactivity can be made for other lisps.<p>[0] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1441520"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1441520</a>",1357744303

""Patently false"" is a bit extreme, but we seem to agree that it's <i>possible</i> to comply with the GPLv2 without being required to distribute source to anyone that asks. That's section 3(a): include source alongside the object code. If the Tesla cars come with a CD-ROM or a USB stick containing the source, then they're in compliance.<p>I mention mail order because, oddly, the GPLv2 actually requires that you provide source via postal mail to people if you're opting to comply under 3(b). That subsection states that in response to a written offer, you must provide source ""on a medium customarily used for software interchange."" That's interpreted by the FSF's GPL FAQ as ""if any [third party] would rather get the source on physical media by mail, you are required to provide that"" [0].<p>There's an additional entry in the FAQ [1] specifically covering the definition of third parties for GPLv2: ""If you choose to provide source through a written offer, then anybody who requests the source from you is entitled to receive it.""<p>So written-offer-for-source appears to be the exceptional case for GPLv2: you have to provide it on physical media, and to anyone that asks. But if you choose to distribute source alongside the binaries, per section 3(a), then you're free from that obligation.<p>Given that GPLv3's section 6(b) intentionally constrained this to only people who possess the object code, it feels like the universality of v2's section 3(b) is a bit of a fluke, and not representative of the goals of the GPL. Thus, in responding to your claim that ""you must make the source available to anyone that requests it. Not only to your customers."" I'd argue that the GPLv2 clearly and explicitly allows you to only make source available to your customers, if you comply with 3(a).<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq#DistributeWithSourceOnInternet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq#DistributeWithSourceOnI...</a>\n[1]: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq#WhatDoesWrittenOfferValid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq#WhatDoesWrittenOfferVal...</a>",1357744087

8634486,comment,8634037,8634037,0,0,_almosnow,,,"I found out this very early, a few years ago when their ad platform was barely launching for everyone. I had a digital magazine and overall it seemed like a good deal, send me people interested in music from these countries at very low CPCs, nice. In total, I may have spent around $1200 USD over a month for a little more than 100 subscribers; needless to say I felt scammed. When trying to figure out what happened (w/ Google Analytics, my own event tracking code and even a few apache logs) I found out very interesting stuff, like that 99% of those clicks were people who didn&#x27;t stay for more than a second on my webpage, like in: they didn&#x27;t even wait for the page to load completely... weird.<p>Just for the record, my ads were not clickbaity and were targeted fine, and my magazine didn&#x27;t suck (IMO at least heh), so if someone clicked on my ad I would pretty much expect it to stay in the page and have at least a look at the cover of the current issue.<p>Why did I burn $1200 if the ads weren&#x27;t working from the start? I wish I had figured that out earlier and spend that money on a fancy chair or whatever instead... The thing is that I was only looking at my daily visitors and believed that everything was fine, it was until the end of the month (where I always made some kind of audit thing to see if I was growing or not) where I noticed that the number of new subscribers had remained the same even though FB ads were active all time.<p>Since then, the only advice I give to friends and clients is &quot;stay away from Facebook ads, it&#x27;s not what you think they are&quot;. And on a small side note, I tried a lot of advertisers at that time and the best experience I had was with StumbleUpon, their referrals converted to subscribers at an incredible ratio (like >50%!!!) and on top of that they drove some extra organic growth even a few months after then campaign was finished, respect for them.",1416459511

Hard to imagine that the perception of value on one front won&#x27;t impact the perception on the other.<p>><i>Facebook lets you target that exactly and clicks to the ads just go to your website.</i><p>This has always been the theory and it sounds really compelling--even intuitive. But, in reality, click-rates on FB ads tend to be abysmally low. We have experimented quite a bit and FB ads are consistently outperformed by Adwords campaigns. This has been the case across different products/services with different demos. Our experience seems to be common.<p>Interestingly, the thing we found most effective on FB was promoting our page through FB ads. But, of course, the value of the fans we acquired is relatively low, as is the point of the article.<p>I think this is in part due to the core problem that people are on FB to socialize and &quot;do&quot; FB. So, they will click a like button, but they don&#x27;t want to leave FB.<p>But, it is ironic that the thing FB ads do best actually creates more value for FB.",1416459436

The diagrams are pretty, maybe, but I can&#x27;t read the process calls from them (the words are truncated because the graphs are too narrow). And I can&#x27;t see, visually, which calls are repeated. They&#x27;re stacked, not grouped, and the color palette is quite narrow (color brewer might help here?).<p>At least, I _can_ imagine how you could characterize this problem without novel eye-candy. Use histograms. Count repeated calls to each method and sort descending. Sampling is only necessary if you&#x27;ve got -- really, truly, got -- big data (which Netflix probably does), but I don&#x27;t think the author means &#x27;sample&#x27; in a statistical sense. It sounds more like &#x27;instrumentation&#x27;, decorating the function calls to produce additional debugging information. Either way, once you have that, there are various common ways to isolate performance bottlenecks. Few of which probably require visual graphs.<p>There&#x27;s also various lesser inefficiencies in the flame graphs: is it useful (non-obvious) that every call is a child of `node`, `node::Start`, `uv_run`, etc.? Vertical real-estate might be put to better use with a log-scale? Etcetera, etc.",1416458636

8634446,comment,8632749,8634251,0,0,stephenr,,,"Google&#x27;s stated reason for abandoning XMPP is nothing to do with product evolution. They publicly stated that the reason for dropping support, was a lack of &quot;industry adoption&quot;.<p>Personally I trust that about as much as I would trust a priest to give me a colonoscopy - open access means less control for Google, which means less ability to collect data and/or display ads.<p>Keeping XMPP support (and federation) would have allowed interoperability with a range of XMPP clients on desktop/mobile devices, AND with users of other XMPP services - whether they be services provided by third parties, or &quot;private&quot; services run by organisations/individuals. It would also have also been useful as leverage to encourage other &quot;big&quot; IM networks to open up their &quot;private&quot; XMPP based IM networks - Facebook Chat, WhatsApp, Cisco WebEx, etc. They&#x27;re all using XMPP, but they&#x27;re islands right now. At this point Google are <i>worse</i> than those islands, because not only are they not embracing open XMPP & federation, they&#x27;re not even supporting XMPP any more - so if FB/WhatsApp said &quot;hey we want to support XMPP federation from tomorrow&quot; Google users have no possible way to be involved in that any more.<p>Google&#x27;s implementation of IMAP is fundamentally broken. The big ticket item, &quot;tags&quot; is ridiculous, as IMAP already has a defined standard for &quot;tags&quot;: the IMAP keywords feature.<p>The usual Google fanboy response to this is &quot;but IMAP clients don&#x27;t support keywords fully&quot;, which of course ignores the fact that standard IMAP clients also don&#x27;t support the idea of messages appearing in multiple mailboxes (i.e. folders) either, but the network effect of Gmail has meant MANY clients have come to support Gmail specific features.<p>Imagine for a second, if instead of its current shit soup solution, Google had implemented the existing IMAP standard for keywords. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect that the majority of IMAP clients would have been quick(er) to implement support for this part of the spec, which would mean users of other IMAP services (either hosted services or self-hosted mail servers) would also be able to use IMAP keywords.<p>It&#x27;s been said before and I&#x27;ll say it again: Google is following the same plays that Microsoft made over a decade ago. Latch onto an open standard, use your market position to make &quot;additions&quot; to said standard, and finally pull support for said standard, in favour of your own closed solution.<p>I&#x27;ll wait for the regular Google fanboy down votes.",1416458321

8634418,comment,8620201,8621677,0,0,diminou,,,"1). Good question.  Paul Sztorc -- the inventor of the Truthcoin concept, on which Augur is based -- has been helping us a lot with game theoretic calculations.  The Reputation concept&#x27;s goal is to create a Schelling point on the consensus.  You can construct a thought experiment, where you look at how the Reputation payoffs align with a perfect coordination game (with Schelling points).  The result was that there is around a 90% chance that the Reputation mechanism creates a Schelling point.  I don&#x27;t have the details of this calculation, but I&#x27;m sure Paul and/or Jack (our project lead) could provide them if you&#x27;re interested!<p>As for emptying the funds, we have the B parameter in LMSR vary according to volume.  However, we&#x27;re currently talking with an expert in automated market making (PhD @ CMU in CS w/ thesis in market makers) and he&#x27;s recommending that we do not use LMSR (because new, advanced, market making algorithms have came out that don&#x27;t allow issues like the one you mentioned come up).<p>2).  I&#x27;m not exactly sure what you&#x27;re asking here.  We currently plan to encrypt votes using time lapse cryptography and then decrypt them via distributed key sharing.<p>3).  SVD 0 and 1 work fine for binary outcomes, however when you include scalar predictions you have to fit the scalar values between 0 and 1 (because that&#x27;s what svd operates on), hence floating point decimals.  We&#x27;re currently writing and implementation using fixed point, however, and that&#x27;s probably what we&#x27;ll end up using.<p>4).  Yes we have, that was the simplest way to do it in a bitcoin transaction, however...<p>5)  Absolutely, we&#x27;re currently looking at Serpent contracts as a way to implement this (it looks like the biggest hurdle will be keeping SVD costs low, but so far it&#x27;s progressing nicely)!",1416457378

164521,comment,164176,164298,0,0,ews,,,"Charging is not the holy grail of spam detection. There are services that should remain always free. CL can't (or shouldn't) charge for posting in categories where the user is not going to perform any economic activity. Charging an amount (no matter how small) in categories such as Personals or Missed Connections (besides not making sense at all) will decrease the amount of legit postings, ruining the quantity and quality of the service. By turning into a pay-per-post site CL could become something like ebay (a pure commercial ""I sell you my collection of Russian dolls"") + job postings site. That is, trust me, out of question.<p>Those non-commercial categories are the ones which are receiving far more fake postings, so the problem on the commercial categories could be considered closed. In non-commercial world, there are several measures being taken care of, such backend data analysis (the most obvious choice) and phone authentication for posting on a small set of categories (such Erotic Services).",1208291955

164507,comment,164137,164246,0,0,apathy,,,"<i>is anyone on here hacking on cuda right now?</i><p>I am not working on cuda (though I intend to now that I see what it can do), but have experience with LAM, MPI, etc.<p><i>i don't know anyone who has a clue about working in a massively parallel environment...</i><p>the basic point of any parallel programming is to decompose a problem so that it is without crippling dependencies during its execution, and parcel out the tasks amongst the nodes/cores/pipelines/whatever, having them report their results as they complete.  There is much more to it, in a practical situation, but a GPU is very nearly an idealized situation and thus this may be all you need to know.<p>Matrix computations are a classic example -- for each row i and each column j, the multiplication of an ixj matrix by another ixj matrix results in (i x j) parallel tasks, none dependent on the others.  lather, rinse, repeat.<p>Parallel programming is superficially simple.  Your goal is to find serializing bottlenecks and kill them one at a time, from the tightest loop outwards.  What makes it complicated, of course, is the fact that not all programming is a series of matrix multiplications, nor are all serializing bottlenecks trivial to decompose.<p>The reason GPUs are an obvious target for friendly parallelizing toolkits is that 3D graphics <i>are</i> inherently representable by series of 4x4 matrices (superficially you'd think 6x6 per point/observer but there's a cute trick you can use to reduce the dimensionality to 4x4... take a 3D graphics course if you are interested in this sort of thing)<p>Whether this should interest you depends intimately upon your problem domain.  If you have a lot of processes talking to each other in sequence, maybe not.  If there are a lot of tasks that don't really depend on each other that are slowing your program down, maybe so.  (Sometimes even MCMC and MLEM simulations can be artfully decomposed so that they turn from the former into the latter... that's the fun part)<p>sorry for the editing laziness, I need to get back to my simulations. hope this helps a little",1208291147

2530811,comment,2529984,2530464,1,0,6ren,,,"Yes, I think a limit on productivity amounts to a limit on knowledge. Does knowledge have a limit? There's no evidence for it; all our present  mathematics of complexity suggests not (but it's possible one will be discovered...)<p>However, energy needs do seem to increase with productivity, and there's limit on how much energy we can get from the sun (a dyson sphere encloses the sun, capturing all its energy). But there's some assumptions here: that we can't discover ways of being productive that require less energy (and wouldn't that enhancement itself be ""productive""?); that we can't discover other sources of energy (e.g. room temperature fusion micro-suns - or something better).<p>Once you factor in the unknown (i.e. knowledge that we don't yet have) it's hard to know what the limits are. I guess the entire universe is a limit on matter... if we can't discover a way to make more matter... or more universes.",1304988878

(also not entirely functional)<p>All the stuff with the closure and defineProperty is basically pointless....<p>In the end what they have is an object with numbers for properties, and they are sticking values in those properties. That's an array.<p>All the hoops they jump through don't do anything except heat up the processor and waste resources, with nothing in return for that.<p>Consider this code which does the same thing:<p><pre><code>  var $ = function(val) {\n      var addr = $.mem.length;\n      $.mem[ addr ] = val;\n      return addr;\n  }\n  $.mem = [];\n\n  var foo = ""foo"";\n   foo = $( foo );\n   console.log( foo )  // 0\n   console.log( $.mem[foo] ) // ""foo""\n</code></pre>\nThis code accomplishes the same thing but is much faster, leaner, simpler, and cross-browser.<p>I'd also say that all of this doesn't really do much to inform one about ""pointers"". Learning about the link between pointers and arrays in certain other languages might be helpful for some JS developers, but there's none of that here. Here is just a roundabout array implementation that doesn't really teach the reader anything.<p>I'm not going to spit on the efforts of someone who is trying to learn something, or be condescending about it (at least not intentionally)....but I think it's necessary to point this sort of thing out so everyone walks away the wiser.",1304988044

'Potential profits' are not tangible.<p>The people who put hundreds and thousands of hours into making content aren't the ones who benefit from IP laws. It's the big cartel-ish companies with a zillion lawyers and friends in government who own rights to the IP and pay artists small royalties that rake in all the cash. IP is not necessary for artists and content-producers to make money. This should be fairly obvious by now after the success of the Grateful Dead, the rise of the indie recording industry, free and open source software, etc.<p>I'm not necessarily arguing that copying content isn't a skeevy thing to do in some circumstances. It's definitely a lot more noble to support an artist. But IP laws inject the state's jurisdiction deep into our private lives, and the result is things like continent-sized firewalls and searching of laptops at borders. In this case the solution to the problem is much, much worse than the problem itself. It doesn't even have to be a problem at all--a smart producer can use copying as an advantage.",1304987774

Or maybe the ISPs might be coerced to only permit ""Accepted"" packet formats (ie inspect-able) to be used.<p>So far ISPs seem to not be caving in <i>too</i> quickly, but there have been some awful exceptions: the recent DNS seizures in the US, and a little closer to home our backbone-less Eircom being the only ISP in Europe to cave into the demand a few years ago to block access to piratebay.org (ex govt, careful).<p>However I shudder at the idea of a seperate darknet, it just seems so... unnecessary!

The evidence cannot be denied.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOK, so provide the irrefutable evidence instead of your opinionated, anecdotal &quot;evidence&quot; that computers cannot associate meaning with a symbol. You make an untestable claim that computers cannot do semantics, perhaps they can and we haven&#x27;t built the right type of computer. Then you use circular logic to &quot;prove&quot; that a computer can only do syntax. Of course a computer that can only do syntax can only do syntax. The first rule of tautology club is the first rule of tautology club.<p>I have not read the Nagel book, and I am not saying you are wrong, I am saying that nobody is going to believe you if you don&#x27;t substantiate your argument with real evidence.<p>If your &quot;idiocy&quot; claim was against Minsky, I would urge you to read even a small portion of his work, particularly Causal Diversity/the Future of AI [1] which is a short technical paper where he talks about how computers will not be able to advance in many areas until they can understand word meanings (semantics).<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/CausalDiversity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/CausalDiversity.html</a>",1395590322

7453748,comment,7450930,7450930,1,0,marcamillion,,,"This is definitely interesting and insightful, especially the lead-gen aspect of investing in OSS with the prospect of future leads. Kind of like a16z investing in PandoDaily - surely that won&#x27;t provide a legit return, but it will give high visibility into the ecosystem.<p>However, I disagree about the Github portion.<p>The Github investment was the perfect type of investment. They conquered the consumer side of the market, they knew their customer acquisition cost, were growing quickly and were profitable. It was the perfect example of just pouring gasoline on a fire to accelerate things.<p>The next logical step is to move into the enterprise, which they have been doing. I suspect that their customer acquisition costs into the enterprise are just as low as the consumer side - because they will have internal advocates from the same developers that either have a free/paid account on the consumer side.<p>So it is the perfect, de-risked, investment for any investor. A16Z happens to be cream of the crop, so they were lucky enough to get that deal.<p>Aside from that...OSS companies actually do make a lot of money. See Sun, RedHat, etc. Selling enterprise versions and support can be VERY lucrative. The only way to do that is to grow significantly and become a major player in the industry - which npm was slowly getting there, with the investment it did accelerate that likely. So I don&#x27;t think they would see it as a loss-leader just to build out a funnel for future deals. That was likely just a bonus, or even &quot;down-side protection&quot; as it were.",1395590003

7453746,comment,7453513,7453513,12,0,hibikir,,,"Regulation will not help, because the problem that causes this kind of stuff is embedded in bitcoin, but called a feature: Transactions are not reversible, and nobody can make transactions on a wallet other than the owner.<p>So in a system built around this, any hack, from good old Mitnick-style social engineering attacks, to something purely technica, will cause irreparable loss. Any computer , network, or even individual that has control of enough coins will have a huge target planted on their heads, because all thefts are final.<p>The security systems on a regular bank do not put fraud avoidance as their number one priority: That&#x27;s just number two. What they really care about is fraud detection, because for most forms of fraud, and especially the ones that could ruin a bank, early detection allows them to undo the damage. If I could take a billion from Bank of America, and there was nothing that could be done about it after the fact, there would be millions of people working on finding ways to do just that. The payoff would be too great for it not to happen multiple times a year.<p>So the best the Bitcoin fanatics can hope for is for the major thefts to be rare. Still, they will happen, it&#x27;s just unavoidable when the stakes are that high, and the rules so in favor of the thief.",1395589975

That said, I have found that it&#x27;s hard to really concentrate while walking. If I find myself in the middle of a particularly difficult programming problem, I&#x27;ll often need to sit down before I can really think about it.<p>But there&#x27;s a lot of time throughout the day where I&#x27;m not doing anything that&#x27;s super mentally challenging, like reading HN :) or catching up on email or finishing light programming tasks, and I try to walk as much as possible during those times.<p>At this point I typically walk between 1-3 hours total per day, and end up alternating between walking/standing/sitting every hour or so. Sometimes after sitting for a while I find myself starting to feel sleepy, switching to walking at this point usually wakes me right back up and keeps me going. Not sure, why, probably a circulation thing.<p>The setup wasn&#x27;t particularly cheap to put together (though you could certainly do it for a lot cheaper than I did), but after a year I&#x27;ve concluded the cost was totally worth it considering how many hours of my life I spend (and will continue to spend) in front of a computer.",1395589864

Most of the things people do are wasteful, but I think what&#x27;s important is a matter of degree. And no, not being able to convince people to buy into that is completely irrelevant to the argument.<p>Where is the computer you were using before now? Chances are that someone else is using it, which more than cancels out any perceived efficiency gain. Chances are that you just threw it away, which is more detrimental to the environment than continued use. Maybe it&#x27;s just collecting dust in your attic, where it will stay useless until any of the above two scenarios happen.<p>More importantly, I&#x27;d like to propose that what drives innovation in computer hardware is largely our attitude towards wastefulness. You couldn&#x27;t sell and develop new hardware at such a rapid pace if people weren&#x27;t readily throwing their old stuff away to have it replaced. I&#x27;m arguing that the whole process is wasteful, never mind that your machine performs better per Watt. Your old laptop probably had a greater cost to the environment in its manufacturing process and after you got rid of it than whatever energy you spent using it during its lifetime, and even more definitely the cost of manufacturing your current laptop was more than what you save by using it instead of the old one.<p>Let&#x27;s get into farming, food production and food packaging if you still aren&#x27;t convinced.",1395589079

For instance, it says the Cornell page only cites one source. The current page cites seven sources in the references section, and one in the body of the article.<p>2. The one source cited in the old version of the page was concentrating on musculoskeletal disorders. It found benefits to using an electric height-adjustable work surface. The EHAW resulted in a minor increase in musculoskeletal discomfort, and a substantial decrease in the severity of upper body musculoskeletal symptoms. The Cornell article does not contradict this. It says that they have found that standing desks increase the risk of some musculoskeletal problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Together, these are just saying that standing can help with some kinds of musculoskeletal problems, and harm with others. The Cornell article is also considering a wider range of potential problems than the EHAW study considered, and has the benefit of being written 8 years after the EHAW study and so can take into account subsequent research.<p>The bottom line is that sitting too much is bad for you, and standing too much is bad for you.

They&#x27;re suspicious of old money children who have inherited a fortune but seem to have contributed little of value themselves. They&#x27;re envious of highly paid sporting or artistic celebrities who get more salary in a week than most of us make in a year.<p>And so they support punitive rates of tax for those who earn noticeably more than they do, not necessarily based on any rational economic argument, but more because they feel it&#x27;s &quot;fair&quot; for the &quot;rich to contribute more&quot; or some such argument.<p>Unfortunately, what that usually does in practice is hit highly qualified professionals or modestly successful entrepreneurs. It hits the doctors who spent years training, then more years working long hours for little money as juniors, and who finally made it to more senior positions where they are literally in a position to save lives with their greater experience but earn a fair bit of money. It hits the top public servants: the veteran judges, the experienced military commanders, the senior civil servants, basically the kind of people who keep government actually working despite the whims of successive political administrations. It hits the lucky entrepreneurs, the ones who made it after maybe putting their lives on hold for years and investing their savings to build a real business that creates value and maybe jobs for other people. All of these people are the kind of people we really need in society to keep everything working, and usually they are people who have reached those positions not through good fortune or family connections but through a lot of hard work over a long period of time.<p>However, the people these punitive taxes <i>don&#x27;t</i> hit are the ones that the popular moneylust craves, because the super-rich are the people who have the flexibility to move their assets and/or themselves around to avoid high-tax environments. Absent serious international co-operation to overcome the naturally competitive tax environment that today&#x27;s globalised society creates, these people will continue to be super-rich no matter what.<p>I like to think that if the people supporting these high rates of tax for those with some above average level of wealth realised who they were really targeting, we&#x27;d have a different attitude to taxation today. As it is, I fear the politics of envy will continue to trump rational economic policy for the foreseeable future, and unfortunately the people who actually did <i>earn</i> their wealth will be the ones who suffer most for it.",1395587793

A bleeding edge discovery in physics is only relevant to a Ph.D. It doesn&#x27;t, for instance, upend classical mechanics on an undergrad level. That small change will never (for the most part) ripple its way all the way back to classical mechanics in a way that warrants a new book.<p>So what changes from edition to edition? The ordering of the chapters, and the questions they contain. It is fundamentally bullshit.<p>When I took my first year civics course, I mistakenly purchased the previous edition. Upon realizing that the table of contents in my book didn&#x27;t match the course syllabus, I sent a quick email to the professor explaining my mistake, the fact that money prevents me from getting the correct edition, and whether or not I could get by with the old one. Sure enough, the (awesome) professor explained that the only things that were different were the order of the chapters and their respective titles (she even gave me a mapping of old title to new). As a further point of cool-professor-ness, she acknowledged the bullshit of the new edition, and explained that the book choice was out of her hands.<p>That was the last time I bought a current edition (sans a few classes which had custom books). Every semester begins with an email to the professor asking if the previous edition could be used, and almost without fail the answer is yes.<p>And the people who make the books caught on. If students know nothing changes from edition to edition, there&#x27;s no incentive to purchase the new edition. So, what the current model for text books? Required Online Access codes. New editions come with the book, PLUS the online portion where you can actually submit your answer to the book&#x27;s questions. Lucky us. Did you pick up a previous version of the book?

The letter is transported by the post office from door to door. While in transit, the post office recognizes, from a 3rd party, that a letter exists, that contains sensible information about the post-office&#x27;s business. Therefore the CEO of that company demands a internal investigation, which searches for a letter with the given senders/recipients address and then opens it.<p>IANAL, but at least where I come from, there exist laws that acknowledge the intimacy and privacy of these letters and would sentence this behavior.<p>So why on earth is everyone talking about policy, terms of service, the lack of alternatives a.s.o? Nobody sees the desperate need of legislation here?",1395587221

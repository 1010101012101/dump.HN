It&#x27;s just another meal-replacement shake, just marketed to a different group.  I&#x27;m sure that if you use it sensibly. (&quot;a shake for breakfast, a shake for lunch, then a sensible dinner&quot; as the ultra slim-fast guy would say.) it won&#x27;t hurt you.   I mean, as long as the stuff isn&#x27;t actively and aggressively poisonous, and as long as you get lawyers or something to mealy mouth your way out of the claims that you can live entirely on soylent, you are fine.<p>I guess... that&#x27;s not really all that much of an objection, from a business perspective.  With all this hype, I&#x27;d say it has a reasonable chance of making money. It does seem to be marketed well, and it&#x27;s timed right<p>But, I think most of the &#x27;middlebrow dismissals&#x27;  are more a response to the hype.  I mean, meal-replacement shakes are an old product; certainly at first glance, if you dismiss the fantastic claims about soylent, like the idea that you can eat it and nothing else, it looks a lot like any other meal-replacement shake packaged for a particular market.  The problem is that the group they are targeting, generally speaking, identifies as more skeptical than most, and they are using the traditional snake-oil style pitch that you normally use to get a product off the ground.  On an emotional level, I (and I think many in their target demographic) find that pretty offensive[1].  I think that negative emotional response to obvious hype is the core of the resistance you see here.<p>[1]or rather, responding positively to something sold using overly-enthusiastic sales techniques would... conflict with my self-image.",1382403574

However I can see genuine use cases for this. I can see this might be useful for certain military operations, such as reconnaissance missions, which require troops be travel lightly without support for prolonged periods, and long term space missions where the marginal cost of extra space and weight is very expensive. Athletes on specialized diets may also use this to control their nutritional intake more precisely.<p>Our culture might even shift to a situation where we take supplements for our routine nutritional needs and enjoy traditional meals for special occasions, like when we have guests over.",1382403567
6589188,comment,6588566,6589007,9,0,_wmd,,,"Unlike ZeroVM, Docker is not a security solution, it is only useful for managing administrative domains within a machine. (To preempt a massively pointless, ~20 year old conversation, Google &quot;chroot security&quot; and &quot;jail security&quot; and suchlike to understand why). On the other hand ZeroVM starts with statically verifying any code that executes adheres to a fixed protocol, and that protocol only allows invoking a small set of rigorously defined service stubs.<p>This may sound vaguely similar to how Linux containers and the syscall interface work, but it involves orders of magnitude fewer LOC written from the outset with a robust security design in mind. Compare that to the thousands of LOC daily churn in the Linux kernel, often written by people who are usually too busy fighting with shitty hardware to care about how their driver ioctl might be accidentally exposed to UID 0 running in a container, and even if they notice, might not even care.",1382403545

The interesting thing here is that - once the tunnel is set up - we&#x27;re really not running any extra software other than SSH (on the client or on the server).  My script just finds unused tunnels and IPs, calls SSH and sets up networking.  So it is as unlikely to crash your machine as OpenSSH is :-)<p>However, I would guess that a grey screen of death bug is due to a kernel-space issue, i.e. the Tun/Tap drivers.  They are not built into OS X, which seems a real shame (as they&#x27;re used with every user-space VPN: OpenVPN, sshuttle etc).<p>It is possible that sshuttle is doing something wrong causing the tun/tap drive to crash.  I would guess that my script would crash as often as OpenVPN does, as I bet/hope ssh is as solid as OpenVPN.

It doesn&#x27;t really matter, as attacker wouldn&#x27;t have your data. For example, you know that on average you have 10 users per hour from some specific referrer and that most of them are coming from a single country. And you know this for every referrer. But attacker doesn&#x27;t, even if he tries to fake it, his requests are either not going to satisfy the profile (he won&#x27;t get something right, like country, user-agent, etc) or he will reach the limit (by trying to send more than N requests per hour for specific referrer, as he doesn&#x27;t know the limit either).<p>Of course you could make it very precise by using a lot more data points for each user: where users usually go after which URL, how long do they stay on each URL, how many requests do they usually make, do they have your cookie, how long, etc. And I&#x27;m talking about cookies as a sign of a user, who already visited your website in the past.",1382401700

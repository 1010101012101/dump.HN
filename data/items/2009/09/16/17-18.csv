The SUN Java courses were just that: the programmer has to learn the language constructs and the library.

The programmer needs to develop skills to understand when and how to change the language. Changing and extending the language is a core mechanism. This makes the language unstable and puts a lot of linguistic power into the programmer.

826368,comment,825872,826256,0,0,jerf,,,"""How does git make programmer A want to disentangle the fix?""<p>Wrong question; the correct question is ""Why does SVN make the programmer not want to disentangle the fix?"" The answer is that SVN makes it a royal pain in the ass. <i>Not</i> impossible. Nothing is impossible. But it's a royal pain in the ass. Git makes it roughly as hard as it should be; there's a certain amount of essential complexity, but it lowers the accidental complexity to something feasible. (I use Fred Brook's ""accidental"" vs ""essential"" complexity terminology from the Mythical Man Month; if you don't know what that is, hie thee hence to amazon and acquire the Mythical Man Month.)<p>The reason I phrase it this way is that it's really a given that the fix <i>should</i> be disentangled; even SVN proponents will tend to agree with this as a matter of principle. So the question is, why have we all just gotten used to not bothering?<p>""How does git make merging easier?""<p>Again, correct question is ""How does SVN make merging hard?"" and the answer is ""in numerous ways"". However, in git, it actually works the way it always should have worked. SVN brings way too much accidental complexity to the task of merging, which is evidenced by the way people avoid it like the plague, whereas the exact same people have no problem using git for it.<p>""It sounds like you're handwaving!"" - OK, you didn't say this but I see it coming. The answer is either Google to someone treating this subject more fully (it's not that hard to find), or try it yourself; I see no point in repeating such people's work in a limited HN comment. (Many of them have diagrams and such.) It is <i>not</i> comparable. It is a night-and-day difference unless you are the only person using your SVN repository, and even then git is still nicer.",1253123029

But if a trade war broke out, it would take a year or two to build the physical manufacturing facilities here, and we'd be at a competitive disadvanatage until that is done.<p>If you think of trade economic warfare - and a great many people do, whether we agree or not - then physical goods are the ammunition. We do not fully understand a software-based economy yet, and for the foreseeable future software still has to run on a physical substrate, most of which takes place overseas.<p>Suppose, just for example, we had a trade war with China and began levying punitive tariffs. China responds by, say, telling the companies that currently manufacture iPhone hardware to stop supplying Apple and start building a 4g version for the Chinese market. The government there has the economic and political heft to do that. It would not be a rational decision, but remember that rationality in war = predictability and thus defeatability. Surprise is a key strategic element.<p>Well, where would Apple be if their suppliers suddenly cut them off? Sure, they could take their designs to manufacturers in other countries, even in the US.

So if you decide to bet the farm on solar and cover the roof of your house/commercial building with panels, you'll have to import them which negatively affects our balance of trade - even if you want to buy an American brand like AM.<p>I personally don't have a manufacturing fetish, but a lot of people are deeply worried about the comparative advantage in cheap labor that exists in China and neighboring countries, because not so long ago you could make a good living and provide for your family with a skilled labor job in an American factory, and many of those jobs have evaporated or been devalued as manufacturing has been exported.<p>There is not as much money in service work and IP creation doesn't involve as many people as manufacturing, so there's a lot of quite skilled and hard-working people who are unable to get decent and dignified work.

I used git for a while (3-6 months) and then switched BACK to using SVN.  It's true I didn't experience pain until I started using git.  That's when the pain started.<p>First, as I said, my use case is highly non-standard.  I'm the only developer on my project, so I don't have to worry about collaborators.  I do my work on a lot of different computers, so it turns out that (for me) one of the biggest advantages provided by version control is effectively synchronizing source code between systems, many of which get erased (e.g. new OS installed ) on a regular basis, all of which have internet access.  It is important that I be able to quickly and simply set up a development environment on a new system -- a somewhat unusual requirement, I realize.   Under these circumstances the primary advantage -- not just of git, but any DVCS -- becomes a major disadvantage.  The whole point of DVCS is that the ability to commit is separated from the ability to update the central repository (git push), where they are the same in centralized VCS.  However... I ALWAYS want to push when I commit.  If I commit to a local repository on a machine that gets wiped, it does me no good.  It needs to get updated in the central, online repository every time.  This can be done with a short simple shell script, of course, but remember: I need it it to be as simple as possible to set up a new development environment.  This adds an extra step, and if I neglect it, I can lose a lot of work.  If I use SVN, I simply don't have to worry about it.  It's automatic.<p>Another feature of SVN that I like, that's impossible with DVCS: revision numbers.  With SVN, revision numbers increase sequentially from 1 to whatever number commit the last one was.  DVCS can't do revision numbers because you can't determine the sequence of commits until after the commits are made (everyone has their own repository!).  Being able to refer to r378 is a LOT nicer than referring to an arbitrary hexadecimal identifier.  Having commit identifiers that convey information is a huge plus.<p>For me, these reasons are enough to outweigh the advantages of having access to repository history while offline and the better handling of branching that git offers.",1253121814

There is an overall trend to more bureaucratization, and bureaucracies often evaluate their officers based on formal certification, especially when there is no structure to measure output.  So I support wide spread standardized testing ....<p>2.  The public educational system is designed to enculturate the entire population, including a big proportion of folks that are needed to provide working class labor and reproduction of more working class laborers.  So if 80% of the country get a crappy education due to a certification system that rewards mediocrity and punishes excellence, then the system has succeeded.<p>3.  Good education hurts.  Not be Nietszchean (sp?) or anything, but most people are taught that fun and ease are the highest ideals in life -- how can you really teach if you, your administrators, the kids, and the parents all believe that you should maximize personal pleasure rather than maximize personal accomplishment?<p>I apologize for the rant, but the unbelievably bad education in the US is probably the issue that most infuriates me.",1253120674

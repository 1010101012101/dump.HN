I could say a lot about the different situations professionals and individuals are in, and I'd be happy to share any thoughts if you're interested. That said, I'd like to point out two things:<p>1. Most individuals do consistently worse than the market (so do most mutual funds, actually)<p>2. Most of Buffett's major successes, especially the early ones, have had nothing to do with his predictions of how a company would perform in the future. They were based on the difference between a company's current assets vs. its current stock price. Eg one of his major successes was in buying shares of Sanborn Map company when Sanborn had assets of $65 per share, but shares only cost $45 each [1].<p>It's still possible to invest using this method-known as value investing-but it's much harder today. The reason is that information is much more freely available. Eg in the Sanborn example above, it took Buffett a significant amount of research to find Sanborn and to realize that they were undervalued. Today all of that information is available to anyone online.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett#Business_career"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett#Business_career</a>",1333029054

Just wanted to throw in my personal experience with DuckDuckGo, and it doesn't necessarily reflect on DuckDuckGo specifically, however:<p>After seeing them pop up here once or twice quite recently I thought I'd give it a go, I opened up preferences in Chrome and switched my default search over to DDG. It felt good, made a nice change but was certainly a bit ""odd"". I found what I wanted, most of the time albeit it with a slight drop in quality vs Google.<p>But my biggest gripe with them was confidence. I'd just started out at a new job as a programmer and as you can imagine, I was searching for a good few things, usually things I was struggling with and I just didn't feel sure that I was getting the best results I possibly could be. You might think thats totally crazy, but when your battling an issue as many of you know, you want more than anything to work out whats going on. I didn't have any margin for error, I wanted the best results right there that second.<p>Specifics aside, knowing that Google is far superior in their results makes it real difficult to use another search engine really, extra features (!so etc) or no extra features. I personally search because I need to ""find"" something and I usually don't know where that something is, opening up Stack Overflow isn't that much of a chore for me. Its the <i>other</i> bit I need help with.<p>Anyway, I commend their mission and hope they succeed in taking a fair slice of the market.

I learned three important lessons, of which I had read more than once prior to, but they are as follows:\n1. Do not try to predict the market. Follow it. To be more specific, and less ""duh"", invest in securities that show (from a speculative standpoint) the potential to continue to move in a direction, but with ""smart"" money behind it. This brings me to 2.\n2. It takes money to make money. This is not to say that it is impossible to turn $1,000 into $1M, just a lot less probable. When you are following the ""smart"" money, you are playing the game and the game is based on probability. The more money you have to invest, the more potential candidates you can hold. By cutting losses short and riding out the winners, you can make a considerable amount of money. Discipline and money management are the key here. Being right or wrong is not the way to look at investing; I tend to say, ""I held the stocks that made me a profit, and sold the ones that didn't.""\n3. You will lose money, you will be in the wrong security and the worst time, and you will 2nd guess a great investment. It will happen over and over. You have to be mentally prepared to look past this. You have to be objective and you have to discipline your mind to treat loses as a necessary part of the game.<p>Well, to actually answer the question, I am invested in BAC, PFE, GE, and VZ. All of which are for testing purposes for a new strategy that makes us of technical analysis over a long(er) term.<p>I realize my knowledge is minimal, but I hope it helps.",1333028129

You get really, really good at a few important skills (written communication, computer programming, and social skills are all very important).

What Acari used to do for free, we now do with chemicals, poorly.  Peons have to buy their seed instead of re-using their own (mostly due to the usage of hybrid seeds, which are designed to reproduce very poorly).  Plus, the seed is not adapted to the soil which then has to be irrigated, pesticized etc.  Not to mention transgenic plants, which are not used to feed the world, but starve it (terminal seeds and patents come to mind).<p>We are already seeing some of the effects now, and it sucks (health, peasant suicide).  But for now it <i>merely</i> sucks. The real danger lies elsewhere.<p>See, we hardly need fertilizers or pesticides. Except when the soil is dead, with no fungus nor acari to provide what the plants need to grow.  Or when the soil is compressed by excessive ploughing, and the roots can't set in.  Or when the soil is burned by the sun at the end of the summer, and is not protected by weeds (which in this case wouldn't actually be weeds).  Most our soil is suffering all three.  Therefore, we badly need a heavy industry, mostly based on oil.<p>When there is no oil, we starve.<p>It won't be quick.  Oil will get more expensive, and so will food.  Add in some random financial crisis, and the industry could halt for a time.  This wouldn't be a big deal if our soil was alive.  But when it's dead, you can't grow squat on it without a relatively heavy industry. Fortunately, we can revive soils.  With hedge wood, actually (systematically cutting hedges was a really bad idea).  It takes 3 years however, so we'd better start before we actually need live soils.<p>> <i>You don't get 10 productivity growth points ever year</i><p>I wasn't clear. I just meant that producing more and more goods in less and less man-hour <i>would be</i> a wonderful thing, and we should basically push for it.  I also meant that we do have bit of that kind of growth (if I recall correctly, productivity doubled since the 70s, mostly due to computers and robots).<p>> <i>Economically an politically speaking things get better slowly.</i><p>Agree.  It does get better.  My fear is that we are too slow.  We need something good enough before we start starving.  Because if we do, things will get ugly.  Will something good come out of that?  Maybe.  The French Revolution itself started as an ugly uproar of starving people.  But I'd rather avoid it, if at all possible.<p>> <i>Well we clearly see is that what works is to grow the food where it grows the best and bring it to where people want to eat is.</i><p>It works in the short term, for the West.  I think the cost of transportation is vastly underestimated, because the price of fossil fuels is vastly underestimated.  The market hardly measures environmental costs, nor does it plan for several decades ahead classic tragedy of the commons.

In my opinion derivatives present a better alternative and I am particularly fond of stock options, which can be used for either speculation (bet on the performance of a company) or as a safety net on your long positions (like an insurance policy). With options you can make money when the market goes up, down or sideways based on your position. Something to consider, is that your exposure with stock options tends to be a fraction of what it would be if buying the underlying stock. Your exposure is limited (you can only lose as much money as you paid for the contracts) and your upside is ""theoretically"" unlimited.\nIf you are interested in learning about it. make sure to grab McMillan's ""Option as an Strategic Investment""\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Options-Strategic-Investment-Lawrence-McMillan/dp/0735201978/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1333026894&sr=8-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Options-Strategic-Investment-Lawrence-...</a>",1333027538

Half word accesses have 2 byte alignment, and word accesses have 4 byte alignment. So in theory it would be easy.<p>I use ArrayBuffers for the RAM array (where supported). You can have different views for the same array buffer, so in theory I could have the ram ArrayBuffer with an 8bit view, a 16bit view, and a 32bit view, where each would be used for accesses of their size. In that sense, you're absolutely right and I think a good speedup would be achieved by that change (something like 2x speedup as most accesses are in fact 32 bit).<p>I don't do that for endianness reasons. The LM32 is big endian, and most devices nowadays are little endian. Unfortunately, the state of ArrayBuffer is still kind of chaotic, in that the endianness of the ArrayBuffer is the endianness of the host (they do this for performance reasons). So I can't do the v32[rpc] thing. Theoretically, I could if the programs have Read-Write consistency, i.e., if they only used the same size for reading and writing some data, which they don't. A program that tests the endianness of the processor, for instance, does not have read write consistency.<p>I could use ArrayBufferViews to access memory in an endianness-independent way, but I tried it and it's actually much slower.<p>To make memory faster, two things can be done either:\n1) emulate a little endian processor instead.\n2) have a fast byteswap operator in javascript, without a function call (never gonna happen).<p>So since 2 is never going to happen, the solution is to tackle 1.",1333027486

You can actually see this on a Perf graph. 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5. The step discontinuity is because the number itself isn't reported to employee. The bucket is. (3.0 to 3.4 is a huge range, from the 3rd to 65th percentile of the company, but any number in this stretch is reported as ""Meets Expectations"".) The 3.5 jump happens because the employee gets sick of ""Meets Expectations"" and the half-step semi-promotion is used to perk him up a little bit. But again, ""Exceeds Expectations"" is a huge range (3.5 to 3.9) and the numbers are still put in the low end of the range. 3.5 will very rarely get a person promoted.<p>What the numbers are supposed to represent is a probability that the employee would succeed in the next higher level. 3.x is an x out of 10 chance that a level-N employee would be successful at level N + 1. 2.9 and below is cause to start the PIP/termination process, with a recommendation of timeframe (2.9 = 60 days, 2.8 = 45, 2.7 = 30); 4.1 to 5.0 represents various degrees of consideration for various (sometimes very lucrative) special awards. At 5.0, you might see an EMG award that would impress even bankers.<p>The ones who overuse 3.0 and 3.5 are the not-so-nice managers, not the evil ones. The evil managers are the ones who use PIPs to block transfers. Those are the 4.1-to-PIP cases where the target has to get a VP override in order to make the move.<p><i>In the meantime, your manager can sandbag your quarterly performance rating and taint your compensation and chances for promotion for a long time.

3770894,comment,3770523,3770523,12,0,Lazare,,,"Do yourself a favour; invest in an index.  Don't play the stock picking game.  The human mind works against you; everyone is convinced that they can beat the market.  If it's even a skill (and it doesn't seem to be) it's a vanishingly rare one <i>even among investment professionals</i>.  It's very tempting to think that you could be the next Warren Buffet, but honestly, you're about as likely to get a gold medal in the next Olympics...without training.  Resist that rabbit hole!<p>Having said that, here's some tips if you're going to try and pick stocks anyhow:<p>0) Don't listen to any tips you see on the internet, including these.  If they're actually any good (and not just part of a pump n' dump scam), they'll already have been taken by everyone else.  (Honestly you're probably better off <i>shorting</i> anything you see recommended in a public forum.)<p>1) Pick investments that are likely to go up and down at different times.  If you want to invest in an oil company, also invest in an airline; they often go up and down opposite each other.  (Note:  Again, any obvious tip like this has been exploited to the point that it's no longer helpful.  See para 1, above.)<p>2) Your career is also an investment.  Don't, for the love of god, invest in the company you work for.  In fact, don't invest in any company that is likely to go under around the time you get fired.  Work for Amazon?  Invest in Barnes & Noble.  Or anyone else you can think of that might do well if Amazon does poorly, and visa versa.  And make sure to toss some money at foreign investments; if your country does poorly, maybe some other country will do well.<p>3) Spread investments out as broadly as possibly.  Don't be stupid and say ""hey, the whole market can't go down at once!"".   It can!  But it's less likely than a single stock going down, and this is a numbers game.  There's never <i>ever</i> a sure thing, but if you can just be a tiny bit smarter than everyone else, it'll pay off in the very long term.  (The easiest way to spread investments out is an index.  See para 1, above.)<p>4) And don't just spread your investments across an industry, or a stock market.  Try and split investments across multiple asset classes.  Stocks, bonds, commodities, foreign stocks, etc.  (Via multiple indexes.  See para 1, above.)<p>5) Fees will kill you.  Anything with active management is more expensive than its worth.  Yes, all active management, no matter how good their track record.  At a micro level, past performance is no predictor of future results, and at a macro level past performance is actually negatively correlated.  A very common pattern is to do better and better until you do <i>so badly</i> that it wipes out every gain you've ever made (e.g., the entire hedge fund sector when the financial crisis hit).  (In other words, see para 1, above.)<p>6) On a similar note, don't be too active in managing your investments yourself.  Reacting to every little dip and spike will waste your time and attention, rack up huge fees, and guarantee bad results.  Once you've figured out your strategy (hopefully involving index funds), figure out how much you can save per paycheck, and just do that, with as much automation as possible.  Maybe your strategy is ""save 20% of every paycheck, with 2/3 going into an S&P 500 index, 1/6 into foreign stocks, and 1/6 in commodities"".  That may be a terrible strategy, but it doesn't matter if you can just stick to it, and (this is important) don't check to see if it's working for at least a decade.<p>7) Individual investors persistently WAY underperform benchmarks, because of timing issues.  They will hear some hype about a stock, or an asset class, or the idea of investing, and they'll enter the market at or near the peak.  Then when things go pear shaped they'll panic and exit, locking in their losses.  It's routine for ""the market"" to have a higher return than the <i>average</i> investor gets; often <i>much</i> higher.  Unless you want to lose all your money, don't follow the herd.  Your best bet is to just leave your investmens alone (in an index fund) and don't even look at them.  If you can't bring yourself to do that, then be as contrarian as possible.  If everyone is talking about how awesome gold ETFs are, or the growth potential of tech stocks, get OUT.  On the other hand, if a sector crashes, buy!<p>8) Finally, one more bonus tip:  Go for passively managed index funds.  (But if you really want to pick stocks, go for ones with low volatility.)",1333026524

Maybe this is one of the things you need to learn from experience, no matter how smart you are and how many blogs of smart people you read.<p>I am thinking maybe the reason that there is so much more competition in these markets you listed, for a big part is that they are much more addressable. We ""technology people"" almost have a reflex ""I have a problem, I am going to google the solution."". That reflex might be much less developed with spa owners and other small business owners. They might be more inclined to ask a fellow business owner, how they handle problem instead. Maybe you would need to run ads in spa-owner-magazines (I don't know if that exists) to reach them or something like that.<p>EDIT: I don't know if you agree, but maybe another lesson is: just because a market is big (US), that does not mean it's the best business opportunity. Maybe you should have started this in France first and then scaled to other countries when and if you had a working business model.

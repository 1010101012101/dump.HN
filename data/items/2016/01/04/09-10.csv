10834747,comment,10832207,10834000,0,0,belorn,,,"Just a minor nitpick, but adding a GNU license to the code base do not mean you have to change the license. The distribution of a code base that combines different licenses must simply follow each and every condition of the compatible licenses.<p>The effective license will of course look very similar to the GNU license, since following the GNU license conditions will most of the time also mean that you are in compliance with the permissive licenses conditions, but there are exceptions. For example, GPLv3 do not forbid distributors to use the authors names in the promotion of products, but it is compatible (under the additional terms section) with 3-clause BSD that explicitly <i>do</i> forbid such promotion.",1451901572

And you&#x27;ve hit on the core reason why computing is so eternal: there aren&#x27;t physical limits.</i><p>On the contrary, there are several. The speed of light. The plank constant. Heat issues. Interference issues. Issues with printing ever smaller CPU transistors. Plasma damage to low-k materials (whatever that means).<p>And all kinds of diminishing returns situations in Computer Science (e.g. adding more RAM stops having that much of a speed impact over some threshold, or you can make a supercluster of tens of thousands of nodes, but you&#x27;re limited by communication speed between them, unless the job is totally parallelizable, etc).<p>><i>When a computer becomes ten times faster, we don&#x27;t affect the world ten times more profoundly.

Skylake is the first change to this aspect in roughly a decade, with the ability to now fetch up to six micro-ops per cycle. Intel doesn’t indicate how many execution units are available in Skylake’s back-end, but we know everything from Core 2 through Sandy Bridge had six execution units while Haswell has eight execution ports. We can assume Skylake is now more than eight, and likely the ability to dispatch more micro-ops as well, but Intel didn’t provide any specifics.<p><a href=""http://www.maximumpc.com/idf-2015-san-francisco-skylake-deep-dive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maximumpc.com/idf-2015-san-francisco-skylake-deep...</a>",1451900168

When you start fresh, there are lots of low hanging fruits to get. At some point, you&#x27;ve reached several limits (including physical limits in measuring and experimental equipment without which you can&#x27;t go further, and which you can&#x27;t overcome because they&#x27;re, well, physical limits).<p>And that&#x27;s even without taking into account a regression (e.g. because of a huge famine, a world war, nuclear war, environmental catastrophe, a deadly new &quot;plague&quot; like think, etc.).",1451900013

The main force keeping prices down is competition, not the fact that landlords are being kind.  If land taxes are increased, then all landlords will raise their prices, and the market <i>will</i> bear it - the other choice is to end up living in the street.<p>The advantage of the LVT is that in theory the market could bear the price increase because there will be a corresponding drop in the salary tax that most renters are paying.  The idea is that the government effectively takes a large slice of the profit from rent, instead of it all going to landlords.  The problem of course is that this creates a disincentive for landlords to invest in property, reducing supply, and now we go back to high prices because of market forces.<p>There is no simple solution to the high price of land, except by increasing supply or reducing demand.  In other words, building more housing (which requires us to <i>encourage</i> landlords, not discourage them), or reduce the population.  Just think, in a world with half the population of today, we would drastically reduce the percentage of salary devoted to housing.  Not bad really.",1451899850

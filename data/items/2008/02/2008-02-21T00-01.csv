120134,comment,119964,120048,0,0,sspencer,,,"That movie list is a pretty good snapshot of movies I HAVE watched more than 5 times.  I wonder, though, would I be inspired to watch them that much if I didn't have physical media of them lying around?  The ease with which I can throw one on while I am doing scut work or something kind of lends them a tendency to be played more, I think.<p>For example, I just downloaded and watched ""Jackie Brown"" in a window while I was fiddling with Python stuff for work.  My ""Jackie Brown"" urge is pretty much satisfied, to the point where it is unlikely that I will want to watch it again in the next year or so.  For ""Jackie Brown"", it is simpler for me to just snag it off a tracker than to purchase a copy, since I have no interest in watching it all that often.<p>Interesting read.  Definitely made me think about what films I have on disc, and which ones I download, and what delineates the two.",1203555439

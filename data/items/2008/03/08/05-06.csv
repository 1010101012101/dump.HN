I'm against forcing people to use any particular OS (I would never take a job for example that required me to code on Windows). If your employees want Macs go ahead and buy some.

131801,comment,131668,131783,0,0,derefr,,,"> I would imagine that a comp sci department where they never reach a point where the ""rubber meets the road"" is not worth the trouble.<p>...unless your rubber has already met your own personal road long ago. I, personally, learned everything <i>practical</i> I needed to know about programming long before I stepped into a CS class, mostly from self-teaching and the web; I only took CS to ""straighten out"" my theoretical knowledge. I would have loved a CS department with no computers installed (except perhaps for interactive debugging after it's already clear that you can express yourself in pseudocode.)",1204955814

131799,comment,131489,131630,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I think that your response -- and the one at 37Signals -- both point to problems with workaholics in an unstructured environment.<p>An effective manager has, among their skillset, the ability to recognize the workaholics, and recognize the early signs of burn-out. That sort of manager knows how to massage people so that the workaholics can get their fix -- and do so in a way that really helps the company! -- without making other employees feel guilty, and without letting the situation evolve into a burn-out scenario.<p>Workaholics will also tend to develop the workaholic streak only so long as they perceive that there is that much extra work to be done. If you have a company full of workaholics, and they're all working around the clock for an extended period of time, then you're understaffed or horribly mismanaging your projects.<p>I'm a workaholic. That doesn't mean that I want to spend all of my time working in the same chair, and if I were to find myself (again...) in the situation where I'm putting that much effort into a company that didn't appreciate it, then I'd leave. However, I think I'm a pretty useful asset if suddenly the company finds itself staring down the cold barrel of a deadline that's gonna require a quick burst of 14 hour days. I've also in the past stayed late to implement new features, or just push things a little bit further ahead.<p>Now, let's say you don't have any workaholics in your company. What happens if something does require the big push? Now you're forced either to demand overtime, which can generate some pretty serious resentment, or you're forced to figure out some other way out of your problem, which'll probably involve missing the deadline.<p>I would think of workaholics as the 10,000RPM part of the engine that is your company. You can't run the engine that hard for very long, but when you need that power, there's just no substitute.",1204955626

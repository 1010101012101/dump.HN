297941,comment,297289,297507,0,0,rglovejoy,,,"All engineering majors at MIT were <i>not</i> required to take SCIP, just the EE/CS majors.  Back when I was a student, the rest of us either took 1.00 (C as taught by civil engineers) or 2.10 (Fortran, by mechanical engineers), or we simply learned a language on our own time.<p>That being said, the purpose of 6.001 (SCIP) was not to learn Scheme, but to use Scheme to introduce students to some of the fundamental concepts of computer science.<p>As for Feynman, the reason he only taught the class once (over three semesters, I believe), is that there was only one Feynman, and he had a pretty full plate of other things to work on.  The ""Feynman Lectures"" were never meant to be textbooks.  They were what they were: lectures, to be read by students seeking additional insights in physics.",1220842414
297940,comment,297695,297782,0,0,jpd,,,"True, but while many do not have google ads on them, many do as well. By expanding access to the internet and by expanding the amount of information displayed on the internet, it will improve upon the amount of people who use Goodle Advertising. If Google makes the internet available to 360,000 more people, and 10,000 new web sites start using their adwords, they'll have dramatically increased their profit margin. Not only will the new sites on their advertising bring in money, but all the new people now clicking on their ads will too. Win-win.<p>So, you are right. Not everyone is bothered about revenue, and not everyone uses their advertisements, but more people online and more websites online means that Google will make more money.",1220842377

297938,comment,297539,297779,0,0,rrf,,,"I think it's important to consider Fred's clarification in the comments section: ""when i say ""feeds"" I don't really mean RSS/google reader/blogines/netvibes they are part of what i am talking about, but just a part of it the facebook news feed is the biggest thing out there today in terms of aggregating info you'll likely care about and that's a very mainstream service. twitter and the smart aggregators like techmeme and hacker news are also a big part of what i am talking about and they are also easier to consume than RSS for the mainstream user. i am sorry i wasn't more clear about that in my post.""<p>So I think Fred's point is simply that there is a trend towards using feeds for finding relevant stuff on the web over search. And that there might be monetization opportunities latching onto that trend.",1220841741

Python has very good parsers now. Using ""eval"" is crazy.

(And no one knows how to do that.)<p>Maybe one day all of humanity will take part in the great AI race, and every person will help evaluate AI's to find the best one. I'm not sure it'll be enough though, you simply need far far too many permutations for it to ever work.<p>It would be interesting to use say WoW as a test bed for AI, make sure it always joins a team and see how good you can make it (emphasize the helping other members of the team part). Then send it to second life.<p>But, I still don't think it'll ever be enough. In particular it'll never be able to design for creativity.",1220839950

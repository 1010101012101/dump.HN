A therapist suggested that this is panic due to the great number of tasks in my todo list. You look them all and panic &quot;They are so many&quot;.<p>My recipe:<p>1. Split your work into tasks. They may become hundreds, but don&#x27;t worry. Describe them on a paper, or in a todo app.<p>2. Pick ONE suitable task for the moment.<p>3. Write it down on a piece of paper and put it in front of the keyboard. Close the todo app or push out of sight all other papers!<p>4. Prepare your workstation - open the IDE/text editor with the needed files open. Open the browser on the page you&#x27;ll be working on. (I&#x27;m a web dev)<p>5. Go for a short walk or sit down in a quiet place. Leave all communications behind. NO DISTRACTIONS!<p>6. Start staring at something relaxing - trees, birds, 24h nature channel<p>7. If there comes a thought about the chosen task - write it down on a piece of paper<p>8. IMPORTANT: If you start thinking about the other tasks push the thoughts aside - &quot;They are for later, they are written down. Now back to the current task.&quot;<p>9. After 10-15 minutes of relaxation return to your workstation. Look at the piece of paper and start working on the task.<p>10. When the chosen task is done go to 2.<p>After finishing a task reward yourself mentally and physically. When you are in your relaxation place say to yourself &quot;Task done - good job from me&quot;, and give yourself a treat - something you love - something sweet, cigarette or a Cuban cigar if a big project was finished.<p>The workstation and the place for relaxation must be two separate places - this creates different brain moods, and this is important.<p>I think that the quiet relaxation and pushing aside the thoughts about the other tasks are the key moments in my improvement. Now I can make up to 5-6 fruitful hours of work a day.<p>I hope that this will help to someone with the same problem.",1445680198

I&#x27;ve been lucky to study anxiety deeply enough that it no longer has control over me.

It&#x27;s not that software engineers are going to go away, just that more and more cookie-cutter software will be buildable by less-technical people (eg. like what Wordpress has done for basic websites and what Unity has done for game development).

10443014,comment,10442024,10442976,0,0,nstart,,,"> But most programmers are simply solving technical problems assigned to them by a product manager.<p>Solving technical problems is a creative process. No technical problem that I have ever come across requires the exact same solution for it. You have to think about how you want to express the solution to a given problem. How complex or verbose do you want it to be? Sure there are patterns, but what design patterns can you use to solve this? How do you modify a design pattern to really suit the given problem.<p>Programming IS a creative process. It&#x27;s a process where you cannot ever document how something must be done in a step by step manner which is applicable in every given situation that the document refers to.<p>If one&#x27;s job feels like a job dependent on rote, then that&#x27;s an issue with the job. The software industry does not encourage creative process in many ways, and that holds true even for the design industry. It&#x27;s why so many people break away to become independent designers or developers. It&#x27;s why there are so many sites and comics dedicated to highlighting the absurdities of clients. The discipline of programming or design both require creativity. We are however surrounded by corporations and people that believes that developers and designers should be moved to a factory line type process whereby any creativity you can express is effectively reduced to nil.<p>I totally get this. My day to day programming at work doesn&#x27;t get me feeling like I&#x27;m truly exercising my brains. It&#x27;s mostly handling instructions handed down to me.

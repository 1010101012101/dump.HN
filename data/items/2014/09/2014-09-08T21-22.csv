It&#x27;s not being developed as a Gecko (Firefox internal framework) replacement. So I don&#x27;t think they are making the mistake of restarting from scratch for their core product. The Servo project is done by a different team and Gecko development continues uninterrupted. No procrastination in that area is going on.",1410213584

8287557,comment,8285283,8285491,0,0,Perseids,,,"You have it kind of backwards. Not these sites or their certificates are vulnerable, but the certificate signing process itself is. And by extension all browsers that accept SHA1 certificates anywhere are. To clarify, what the attack does is generate two certificates that have the same SHA1 hash, one of them legitimate and one of them illegitimate. In the worst case scenario the illegitimate one is an itself an intermediate CA, which means the illegitimate one can MITM <i>any</i> connection. You send the legitimate one to the CA to get it signed. When you get it back you swap the legitimate certificate with the illegitimate one - which is possible as both have the same hash - and voila, you have broken TLS world wide.<p>Having a certificate with SHA2 will not save you. A client under attack will not even see it. The only thing that helps is stop accepting SHA1 certificates (and especially SHA1 intermediate CAs) globally. All this stuff about accepting short lived certificates is only a publicity stunt by Google to raise awareness about the issue (an attacker can forge a certificate with any expiry time she wishes).",1410213460

There is still a bit of room to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>In terms of my suggestion it is simply that we need a language construct that creates a new scope without access to globals or &#x27;this&#x27; and creates a pass by reference (i.e. deep cloned) closure.  This allows for zero shared state. Then add back in access to no-shared state globals like HTTP access.<p>Think web workers on a micro not macro scale.",1410213448

I have some ideas to make this easier for users who don&#x27;t otherwise receive mail at their domains, such as by letting them point their MX record at sslmate.<p>A configurable $ limit on /buy is a very good idea; also I should make it possible for users to use sslmate without permanently storing their API credentials on the filesystem.",1410213441

How do you deploy your javascript?<p>Perhaps they hand it off to the next person in the work chain? Most larger IT shops divide up their development and deployment staff along technology and language lines - it makes recruitment easier for the managers who only need to rattle off a list of languages in their job ads, and managers can better control their staff by withholding access to technologies perceived as desirable to work on.<p>Perhaps you ask this question because you work in the new-fangled <i>full-stack</i> area where one person does everything. IMO the &quot;DevOps&quot; doctrine is a huge step backwards for business integrity. The doctrine for IT shops previously was to keep separate the people with access to the data and those with access to the code, hence &quot;Development&quot; and &quot;Operations&quot; were two separate areas. Creating &quot;DevOps&quot; people who can change both the data and the code in the name of <i>full-stack</i> processes opens the door up to large-scale fraud by workers of their employers&#x27; data and even cash.",1410213202

Eliptic curves have been around for ~30 years. AES has had a huge budget for being broken and seeing as it is the predecessor to md5 which was broken before-hand it is not out of the reach of someone who can write up an implementation to use for attacks. The blackhat talk suggests that eliptic curves may be less succeptable to breach even, though it is still up to debate in the crypto communities.<p>There are several open source solutions to factoring and although 40 hours may seem like a long time to decrypt one single encrypted session, it will be easier with more parallel-able GPU or FPGA hardware/newer operating system abstractions that are able to compute more.<p>There is also more research going into making SAT solvers that are parallel so if there is a factor-able solution it may be more do-able.<p>Or if there is a newer breakthrough attack that comes up which does sometimes happen. Many past standards have been broken. In crypto things being broken are usually a matter of research, time, and a budget helps.<p>For example a linux distribution that will also make use of the GPU is currently in work: <a href=""https://github.com/wbsun/kgpu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wbsun/kgpu</a><p>Regardless attacks will still continue to be mostly &quot;side channel&quot; attacks as man in the middle type attacks are usually the easiest way to subvert data exchanges.",1410213196

8287499,comment,8286458,8286840,1,0,eridius,,,"Rust has a good approach here as well, that&#x27;s related to Haskell&#x27;s approach. In Rust, a type can implement the traits `Encodable` and `Decodable`, which are general traits that represent the ability to encode to and decode from some arbitrary format, using objects of type Encoder and Decoder. Each supported format then provides implementations of Encoder / Decoder. The benefit of this approach is the Encodable/Decodable implementations can be automatically derived in a lot of cases.<p>For JSON specifically, the serialize::json module provides Encoder/Decoder implementations, as well as a streaming JSON parser type that can be used to consume JSON outside of the Encodable/Decodable system, and a Builder object that consumes the streaming parser to produce a generic untyped &quot;Json&quot; value that represents the entire structure of the Json. And of course it has some convenience functions that simplify common operations like encoding a value into a string.<p>Given all this, the equivalent of the Haskell operations looks like:<p><pre><code>    let v: Json = ...; // get the Json value\n    // the following traverses the Json to extract the same path as the Haskell\n    // and treats the result as a 64-bit integer.\n    // note: this API is slightly old and has some unnecessary stuff in here,\n    // such as the find method taking allocated strings instead of slices.\n    let x: Option<i64> = v.find_path([&&quot;foo&quot;.to_string(), &&quot;bar&quot;.to_string(), &&quot;baz&quot;.to_string()])\n                         // this should eventually become .find_path([&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;])\n                         .and_then(|obj| obj.as_list())\n                         .and_then(|l| l.as_slice().get(3))\n                         // the .as_slice() will go away\n                         .and_then(|val| val.as_i64());\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s talk of adding support for `do` sugar which would make this much simpler as well.<p>The typed version is much simpler. We can define the struct with a derived Decodable like so:<p><pre><code>    #[deriving(Decodable)]\n    struct Point {\n        x: f64,\n        y: f64\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd then actually decode some Json like<p><pre><code>    let x: json::DecodeResult<Point> = json::decode(source_str);\n    // DecodeResult contains either the result, or an error.</code></pre>",1410212702

8287497,comment,8286504,8286992,4,0,pseudoscops,,,"Speaking of locking the price of your crypto for $, I followed a very interesting AMA on Reddit that was held earlier today about an innovative crypto based Digital Autonomous Corporation (DAC) called BitShares X. All of the utility of Bitcoin, but it also has a distributed on-blockchain exchange AND has assets pegged to the $ AND also pays interest if you hold those pegged assets. I’ve been following what these guys have been up to for a while (i.e. more than a year). Seriously, if it works, I think this is truly novel stuff that rises well above the usual copycat alt coins:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2ftfti/bitshares_x_ama_trade_btc_derivatives_on_the/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2ftfti/bitsh...</a><p>Bitshares X only launched a couple of weeks ago, it’s really only at an alpha stage at the moment and it has already hit the number 4 spot for market cap at <a href=""http://coinmarketcap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coinmarketcap.com</a>. It has had days in the last week where volume has surpassed that of Litecoin. The on-chain exchange built in to the wallet client cannot be shut down or manipulated/debased (like Mt Gox), I think this is one of the first things that grabs peoples attention. Especially Chinese investors or those burnt by Mt. Gox.<p>The most interesting thing is that on this distributed on-blockchain exchange you can trade your Bitshares (BTSX) for BitAssets pegged to real world assets such as the $ or BTC or even gold. I think I understand how it all works and if the market pegs work, which it seems to be at the moment for BitUSD, then it’ll provide great utility. It’ll promote the ability to actually hold you wealth securely in crypto in a less volatile way rather than cashing out in to real fiat for its relative security like many crypto traders do. BitShares X is an experimental DAC, like Bitcoin, but if it works then it avoiding the issue of having to cash out to real fiat gives it a significant plus point over Bitcoin in my opinion.<p>Citi bank recently pointed out that news often touted as being ‘great news’ for Bitcoin (e.g. Dell accepting Bitcoin) actually puts downward pressure on the price if they immediately cash out to $ using a services such as BitPay. Dell use this service to protect themselves from Bitcoin&#x27;s price volatility, but this is liquidity that leaves the Bitcoin/crypto ecosystem. This is not good. It’s only if these companies such as Dell hold their crypto or at least part of it (i.e. like Overstock does) that the liquidity in the Bitcoin ecosystem grows and so does Bitcoin with it. Read up on the details about what Citi had to say here:<p><a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/citi-miners-merchants-keeping-bitcoin-prices-check/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coindesk.com/citi-miners-merchants-keeping-bitcoi...</a><p>If the BitShares derived BitUSD actually tracks the $, and it seems to be doing so, then you, or Dell, would have no reason to move money out of the crypto ecosystem. This is of huge benefit for the crypto currency/equity ecosystem because it means that wealth stays within the system and does not leak back out to fiat. Holders of BitUSD also get paid a yield/interest for holding BitUSD and some have speculated that the amount may be as much as 10%. Add to this that the guys behind Bitshares are actively talking to the guys at Ethereum an the future look really bright I think,<p>I recommend reading the AMA above and follow some of the links to the FAQs about BitShares. I think they are on to something significant. Please feel free to shoot me down in flames if I’ve missed something or if you have a different view. Like I say I’ve been following the BitShares story for over a year now and it’s great to finally see the vision  of the distributed exchange and BitAsset market peg make it from theory to reality.<p>Disclaimer : Very recently I moved a significant percentage of my BTC  holdings (more than 50%) in to  the BitShares X ecosystem with the intention of going long.  Naturally I personally would like to see more people share my views. But do your own homework on this one and never invest more than you can afford to lose!",1410212694

A small autonomous entity has to provide its needs for itself, or wind up negotiating with numerous other entities to assure having necessary resources, not likely a stable or reassuring situation to be in.<p>It appears parallel to the episodic waves of industrial consolidation and fragmentation.  Innovations start off as small local efforts which begin to &quot;catch on&quot;, and the idea spreads.  Over time small autonomous enterprises begin to merge because of efficiency pressure, until only a few giants remain.

The only way you can do this is to rework the program until it&#x27;s back to being a program beholden to events.<p>You could solve most of this with a pre-emption mechanism. Allow an additional way to respond to certain inputs by registering an interrupt instead of listening to an event.<p><pre><code>    function myInterrupt(preEmptedState) {\n        interruptCounter+=1;\n        //do something useful here\n        setExecutionState(preEmptedState);  //switch execution context back to pre-empted thread.\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe parameter to the interrupt function is the execution state of the thread that was pre-empted.  This can be restarted at the end of the interrupt, stored for continuation at a later time (enabling blocking), or abandoned (effectively terminating the thread).<p>What this would need is:<p>An execution state object,  possibly an opaque object.<p>addXXXInterruptHandler(interruptHandler)  ;;  XXX= Timer/Message/Input/etc.<p>setExecutionState(newState)   ;; this function would not return, it would continue the new state.<p>createExecutionState(main) ;; generate a new execution state object ready to run the function main<p>triggerInterrupt(interruptType) ;;  Allow a tread to trigger an interrupt upon itself.<p>If interrupts themselves are simply the running of a new execution state then TriggerInterrupt is just a special case of setInterruptState.<p>Having this as a core would allow a huge number of higher level constructs that would enable blocking functions, and sane interactions with running processes like web workers.<p>Yes, you would introduce the possibility of race conditions etc. but only if you actually used the new functionality. If you chose to leave it alone you would be on the old single eventy thready system that we know and hate.<p>It would also mean you could have someone write var x=0; while(x<10) {} without it killing all scripts.",1410211857

It&#x27;s a lot too go through so Ill need to pick through this more carefully. But the feedback is most definitely useful.<p>Haskell is data race free because they just avoid state. If shared state is involved, it has the same problems and needs to deal (e.g. Via STM). Glitch also gives you far more guarantees than data race freedom (consistency being the buggy).<p>(3) depends on the technique. There are bondage approaches, but there are approaches that allow more flexibility. Glitch is in between that.<p>Transactions have no notion of replay: the transaction fails and then what? Also, transactions are atomic, whereas tasks in Glitch are continuous: if something changes over time, a task will be replayed..a transaction has already been done and you have to manage change very time your self. This same replay mechanism also washes out data races.<p>Glitch doesn&#x27;t suffer livelock problems because effects are not undone until &quot;after&quot; a replay (removing effects that haven&#x27;t redone) whereas transaction just undo everything when they fail. This is a huge difference in terms of making progress! Glitch is not coming from the database field, but rather from general programming semantics where effect ordering requirements are quite common.<p>The problem with optimal orders is that you don&#x27;t know what they are usually appriori. Many systems, like flapjax, require optimal orders because execution is not idempotent. Rather than make that requirement, we instead make execution virtually idempotent through logs. We &quot;could&quot; execute in a more intelligent order as an optimization, but it&#x27;s not required (I&#x27;ve indeed found some tuning in scheduling necessary for performance).<p>The past is only remembered as long as it&#x27;s needed for computing a consistent view; it can be thrown away after. You could also remember the last to do Bret victor style debugging, which is why the feature mostly exists (we could just make sure everything was consistent before processing the next event otherwise), or for distributed processing where computers might proceed at different paces (and therefore will have to agree in a baseline time where none has a task to replay that could change state before it). This is all quite standard in virtual time systems.<p>Pardoxes will cause continuous replay, like writing x = !x, it has no consistent interpretation. It doesn&#x27;t freeze up the system, you can always change the statement to fix the problem (the UI remains responsive).",1410211203

But UK + Eire are not in the Schengen area. EU have decided that all new countries will be in the Schengen area, Scotland thus will not be able to be in the CTA without the rUK (and Eire) effectively accepting the Schengen Agreement. Now I may have misjudged the current political temperature but with the rise of UKIP I can&#x27;t see the rUK voting to relax immigration policy.<p>If Scotland don&#x27;t get in to Europe presumably rUK will be required to maintain border controls whether we acceded to the Schengen Agreement or not.<p>Peacefully?<p>He does at least mention the 2 year war of independence, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence</a>.

Actually most credit card fraud is linked to identity fraud (a hacker stealing someone&#x27;s financial credentials or posing as them on an online/offline store).<p>Most of the credit card information stolen from Target and Home Depot is not used but sold as quickly as possible on underground forums to &quot;the greater fool&quot; who is willing to take a risk to use it (if it still works).<p>Because of the chargeback system, those millions of credit cards stolen are not a huge issue for consumers because they can immediately lock down their card. Cards are replaceable keys. If you believe that you&#x27;ve been compromised, chargeback for whatever amount was stolen from you and change cards.

Timing is important. I take into account not only how quickly someone replies but how quickly I reply or get back to someone. There is a reason and a strategy behind what people do in most, but of course not all cases. Even the time of day they reply and the length of the reply and exactly the words they use as well. Say when you propose something how quickly do they get back to you? All context in different cases means different things.<p>Also timing as far as when you spring things upon people.<p>For example I&#x27;m currently in the process of getting my bathroom quoted for remodeling. I&#x27;ve settled on a particular vendor that I&#x27;m pretty sure I will use. We&#x27;ve been going back and forth on details for probably 6 to 8 weeks. They&#x27;ve given me pricing and I haven&#x27;t asked or said anything regarding getting a discount. At all. I also haven&#x27;t asked for any exact details on products they are using. I don&#x27;t care <i>at this point</i>.<p>What I will do is most likely bring up a discount at the very end of the process. When they have already spent time on the deal and don&#x27;t want to lose it. [1] I will also bring up other factors to them (non monetary but convenience for us) at the end. I know they won&#x27;t be <i>as likely</i> to blow off those concerns after the big investment in time they have made.<p>[1] After listening to my war stories my ex wife used the same technique against me when we were ready to sign our divorce papers. At the very end as we sat there the deal all done and papers ready to sign she said &quot;I&#x27;ll only sign if you also pay for my trip to XYZ&quot;. While I could have walked she knew me well enough to know that I wouldn&#x27;t and actually I was kind of proud that she had listened and learned.

Mozilla is, according to its formal and written mission, dedicated to the &quot;open web&quot; (<a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/</a>), not to all Good Things.  And Mozilla has succeeded in ways because it has consistently held faith in the web, when others have not.  Microsoft gave up on browsers and Mozilla didn&#x27;t, which was Firefox&#x27;s first big win.  Google gets distracted by Dart and (P)NaCL, while Mozilla sticks with Javascript and creates something like ASM.js.  Or compare Android and iOS to Firefox OS – Mozilla is really sticking its neck out to support the open web in this case.  Firefox OS isn&#x27;t about social justice, that is a product being created to defend an ideology focused on the open web, and it&#x27;s a huge allocation of resources by Mozilla.<p>Extensions actually fit in kind of poorly here, which is perhaps why things are rough.  Extensions aren&#x27;t the open web, and while there&#x27;s value in Extensions for Firefox-the-product it doesn&#x27;t have good mission alignment.<p>All that said, I&#x27;d agree that Mozilla, like many mission-led organizations, has a real challenge distinguishing its aspirations from the work that really defines its contribution to the world.",1410210550

Whether particularl issues that occurred under the <i>past</i> weak federal systems in the USA (including that of the CSA) each really illustrate problems inherent to weak federal systems or whether each is simply an example of problems that happened <i>to</i> a country with a weak federal system that aren&#x27;t inherently related to having such a system is a whole series of other arguments.",1410210121

Contrary to popular belief, most core Bitcoiners are not particularly interested in &quot;converting&quot; non-Bitcoin users.  There was a big group that bought Bitcoin as a (risky) investment in fall of last year who try to pump it up, but they don&#x27;t even share many of the core values of the Bitcoin community.<p>I do want people to be educated about their rejection of Bitcoin (i.e., &quot;because tulips&quot; is just annoying).  But it sounds like you are making an education call.<p>So that&#x27;s fine.  I don&#x27;t think traditional fiat is at any risk of becoming obsolete in the foreseeable future.  We can co-exist side-by-side.<p>I hope you can afford us the same respect.<p>PS: I do strongly disagree with &quot;bankless people need banks&quot;.

8287233,comment,8286504,8287066,4,0,DickingAround,,,"Just talking about bitcoin, and not about this specific situation or their adoption: Bitcoin has some minor advantages in technology because the financial industry is slow, but that&#x27;s not the major reason to adopt. The major reason is trust.<p>Historically, it&#x27;s difficult to trust many organizations. The US federal reserve and the US dollar have the <i>best</i> record/reputation in modern history. Top competitors have taken devaluations in WWII and even recently (British pound in 1992, Russian ruble in 1998). That&#x27;s part of why many people use the dollar. Even now, after 2008, when everyone thought the currency was screwed because money was being printed fast, we didn&#x27;t see inflation. But the dollar isn&#x27;t perfect. As recently as the 1970s and 1980s the US dollar experienced double digit inflation.<p>Bitcoin is an alternative currency with less trust in a central authority. It&#x27;s got a bunch of other features like you&#x27;ve both been talking about but it&#x27;s real value add is the lack of central authority (both in terms of volume of currency issued and in terms of your ability to hold your own currency without a 3rd party).<p>Now, maybe you don&#x27;t want to use Bitcoin now because you believe a problem with the US dollar or any other local currency is a &#x27;low probability event&#x27;. That&#x27;s totally reasonable. But it&#x27;s also worth remembering that humans are known to be bad at estimating risk/reward from low probability events. Historically speaking, there will be a currency crisis in the next 50 years. I can&#x27;t think of any fiat currency has ever gone 50 years without some sort of currency crisis (at least of the ones we have a good historical record of). Bitcoin aims to be the first one to do that. We&#x27;ll see if it ever does.",1410210102

While we, like Berkeley, are a ""research powerhouse,"" spend a little time as an undergraduate on campus and you will quickly realize how little the phrase ""research powerhouse"" really means to you. Professors are hired for research, not teaching, which means many are apathetic towards students while others clearly shouldn't be involved in the teaching process at all. There are some outstanding professors in terms of teaching, but the important caveat here is that at a large public research school teaching--which heavily affects the undergraduate experience is not a priority. \nSome argue that being at a large research school offers, as the name implies, a large number research opportunities for undergraduates. That idea is a bit overly optimistic. When you have > 100 students in almost every upper division class, it is exceedingly difficult to build a relationship with professors where you may find a chance to gain some research experience. At least with my experience in the EE department, the number of professors who take undergraduate research students is countable on one hand and most of them refuse to accept anyone who is not a 3rd/4th year. I managed to claw my way into a few labs (not EE or CS related) merely because they needed someone who could write code. \nThe US College ranking done at U.S. news is meant to consider undergraduate teaching, and in this aspect large public schools fall far behind. If you want to see the value of research taken into account, look no further than the graduate school rankings. I don't mean to imply that the rankings are accurate, just that there is a valid reason for excluding large public schools from the top of the college rankings.",1359748778

5153059,comment,5152298,5152978,3,0,king_jester,,,"Whether someone is sexist on purpose or not is irrelevant, it doesn't make things any less sexist. Often people will claim lack of knowledge when they do something that is sexist and use that as an accuse to continue engaging in sexist behavior, so its important to call out sexism regardless of how it occurs and for those responsible to make that apology and commit to recognizing that sexism.<p>As to whether or not this marketing event was degrading, the answer is quite clearly yes. Women's bodies were used as a marketing ploy to sell a product. Women's bodies as a commodity is a long running sexist theme in our society, including marketing. Commodify-ing women's bodies is dangerous and is directly related to violence against women.

This is basic nature and no one can change it.<p>Except when, you know, they are gay or on the asexual spectrum.<p>> Using either to sell a product is not exactly sexism. For example, many deodorants use both male and female models to promote their products.<p>People aren't objecting to the existence of ad, but rather that this marketing reduced women's bodies to a commercial commodity. Lack of self agency and a women's body as property is a very sexist issue that is present in US culture today and affects many.<p>> Sexism in my definition would be when given the same opportunity, when one gender is being paid or treated better than another gender, that would be sexism, because someone is being treated unfair.<p>This is the case today. We have well documented instances of individual sexist treatment and systemic sexist treatment, mostly towards women.<p>> What hypermac (the company in question) did was not wrong. They hired models who were for god's sake ready to do it. They were ready to accept money and stand nude on their product exhibit. It would have been unfair if they were treated unfair, or against their will, none of which had happened.<p>Getting a job isn't some kind of process that occurs in a cultural vacuum, a lot goes into why people take on jobs that are sexist in nature. Also, just because the company can hire models for sexist marketing doesn't mean they should.<p>> The real problem about women being objectified is that women are ready to be objectified - either for money or for some other form of compromise.<p>This is victim blaming at its prime. You are blaming cultural objectification of women on women.<p>> So, if you want this to stop, you have to revolt when someone from your own gender (male/female) is ready to represent your gender infront of a public audience and accept to be objectified for money.<p>This directly against what feminism is even about in the first place. Feminism doesn't proscribe that you attack women who exercise their self autonomy. In fact, telling women to attack other women who act in a way they don't approve of is a common way to sow discord and distract people from the larger social and cultural issues that affect their lives. That is, you are telling people to ignore context and attack other people who are just as affected by our society as they are.<p>> Don't go after the corporation that hired them, instead ask these people why they let them objectify you, on behalf of you/your gender in the first place. This is the real problem.<p>That you see no problem with ignoring corporate behavior and attacking individuals speaks a lot about how you feel with regards to corporate domination and control over people's lives.<p>> I love the way that these rogue women go after men (and vice versa) only because they want an apology to feel superior and write a blog post about it.<p>Lol ""rogue women""<p>> There's a great saying - Any publicity is good publicity. I hope these feminists realize this and stop fucking themselves up like this, publicly.<p>So now feminists are fucking themselves up because a company engaged in sexist marketing and people called that out?

Many of these titles lacked strong replay or the ability to play with friends. Releasing in such early alpha (for money) built a highly engaged fan base (as most closed alphas tend to be) and yet set expectations rather low. Notch's clear passion and close relationship with the community along with frequent updates did a lot to build a strong community that essentially became invested in his success at a personal level. The simplicity of the game also created a situation where seeing how much could be done with so little became a big part of the appeal or at least what grabbed outsider's attention. The result of all of that was a genuine grass roots movement that snowballed into an unstoppable promotion machine.<p>It's not to take away from the game or his skills at all, I have a ton of respect for him and what he built.

5152963,comment,5152435,5152435,16,0,Irregardless,,,"> The report concluded that there were observable, repeatable and verifiable ways of measuring teacher effectiveness, wrote Gates in the letter. Anonymous student surveys that asked such questions as Does your teacher use class time well, get class organized quickly, help you when you are confused""  were proven to provide useful feedback as were reports from trained professionals observing teachers at work.<p>Students are notoriusly bad at rating their professors. This was proved with almost ideal control groups at the Air Force Academy [1] and again with groups of trained professionals/graduate students who learned first hand about the 'Dr. Fox Effect' [2]. Even teachers don't seem to like the teacher evaluations done by students [3].<p>Anecdotally, I can say that most students in my college classes either didn't show up on the survey days, or they walked out the door as soon as the surveys were being handed out. There's also no incentive to provide useful feedback from the student's perspective. If you're taking a survey about the class, it means the class is over and you'll probably never see that professor again, so why bother? I made an effort only because I felt an obligation to help future students, but I'm not sure there are many kids in college who share that feeling.<p>> Mary Ann Stavney, a high school Master Teacher profiled in the annual letter, spends 70% of her time observing other teachers, meeting with them and providing input. The problem, of course, is that this kind of measuring, particularly the hands-on observation in classrooms, is costly, adding about 2% onto payroll.<p>So you can have cheap and unreliable measurements, or you can have accurate but costly ones. Who's going to pay for the latter? The rating agencies? The schools? The students? Imagine the costs to enact such a program across all colleges in the U.S. alone -- some of the larger state schools easily have > 1,000 teaching faculty across a myriad of disciplines, and they're teaching increasingly diverse student bodies.<p>The thought of trying to implement a thorough, standardized program of that scale is mind boggling. And that's probably why we've been facing this dilemma of measuring teacher effectiveness since the day the first schools opened. Bill Gates is right that we have a serious problem, but it doesn't sound like he's any closer to a solution.<p>[1] <a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/college-inc/2010/06/study_high-rated_professors_ar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/college-inc/2010/06/study_h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Fox_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Fox_effect</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_evaluation#Criticism_of_course_evaluations_as_measures_of_teaching_effectiveness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_evaluation#Criticism_of_...</a>",1359747903

Although, frankly, I've looked at company websites, and top-level executives with PhDs are not _that_ common, even in software companies. But yeah, I mean, there _should_ be a top-level decision maker who is _at least_ keeping a close watch on any research related to what the company does (I'm talking software companies here, not companies that _use_ software)... and the vast majority of people who have the necessary skills will be people who did PhD-level research. Anyway, this person should be able to advocate for how the company can leverage new research, and this should not just be left to lower-level (hierarchically) technical folks who have no true strategic voice in the company.\nI think there might be a correlation causation thing happening here. :) A PhD doesn't necessarily give you leadership ability, you might join at a higher position and move up in a shorter time frame (because you joined at a higher position).<p>> Do you think this is true even of CS PhDs? I feel like in my research group, there is a real chance for any of we (students) to do this, but AFAIK I am the only one who has ever really thought about it, because my colleagues tend to keep their noses in the books and focus on narrow technical concerns, whereas I'm really a big-picture thinker. So: in my case, plenty of opportunity, just not much interest among actual PhD students.<p>My experience is mostly of C.S./Machine Learning PhDs. Let me give you an illustration. Say you spend your entire PhD figuring out one specific problem in recommendation systems, like for example, building optimization algorithms where the error rate is 6% or so.

In this form you'd end up with a very, very high resolution image because only a tiny fraction of the image would be falling on each sensor. Each fraction of the total image could then be combined into one mega image, and voila, your 5TP image!<p>If you have a million people all focusing their 5MP cameras at the same object, you'd end up with a million photos of the same object, but without anything more than 5MP because the entire image would fall on each sensor.<p>Perhaps people should donate their old phones to science and equivalent sensors could be arranged into a giant grid with a powerful lens attached.

There are no painted male models in their staff photo from the event.[1] Was it decided that including naked men would somehow hurt the effectiveness of the display, and if so, why? Certainly there were willing male models, so it seems that HyperMac just steered clear of hiring men. The accusations of sexism (or more accurately, objectification) all springs from that, and the unwillingness of the CEO to even acknowledge that as a concern is honestly disturbing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hyperblog.com/2013/01/thanks-for-an-amazing-ces-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hyperblog.com/2013/01/thanks-for-an-amazing-ces-2...</a>",1359747314

And I'm not a snob -- I can talk with most anyone, about genuine interests (interests on either party's part, not just my own).  Or just sit around drawing spirals in the pancake syrup, for a while.<p>I <i>don't</i> particularly enjoy discussing the latest Hollywood movies and actors ad nauseum, whose existence and which conversation seems to serve significantly to reinforce established, simplistic stereotypes.

A good part of that socialization reflected people actually paying attention to and remembering what each other were interested in and doing, and what was going on in their lives.<p>Again, this is just an opinion, but I think some of the ""anti-social"" attributed to ""nerds"" and ""geeks"" is rather an active <i>dis-interest</i> in much of the lowest common denominator of what we consider ""social"".<p>(Some, not all.

Societal pressure can cause people to behave in ways that are detrimental to their own well-being (especially in a situation where the actual effects are extremely subtle). Question: which job would be more appealing to the average person who identifies as female: a job where she gets to work with other women and not face any criticism, harassment, or judgement for doing so, or a job where she is surrounded by men who (on average) get paid more and hold all of the higher level positions?<p>Take it a step further: if I'm a women, and I was being objectified, I would prefer to be objectified by women rather than men. I'd prefer to be in a career and a position that allows me to control how I am perceived, if I am going to be objectified regardless of which career I chose.<p>The current power structure favors men, and it's more the responsibility of those with power to make positive change.

In November, BritRuby, a Manchester\n  conference of Ruby on Rails coders, was canceled after\n  outrage broke out online at its all-male lineup of\n  panelists. Ruby coder Sean Handley took to GitHub to\n  criticize the online community for bringing down the well\n  -intentioned conference with ""careless words.""\n\n  ""Turns out, a lot of the prominent Rubyists are white guys \n  and all of the ones who said they'd like to come were,\n  indeed, white guys,"" he stated. ""Making an issue out of\n  that is, frankly, misguided.""\n\n  Is it an overreaction to make an issue, likewise, out of\n  the words being used by GitHub coders? Perhaps. But if\n  anything, Morris argues that the issue strikes at the\n  heart of nerd culture itself:\n\n  The reason were seeing such vicious anti-equality \n  bullshit in the geek community over the BritRuby situation\n  and other conference type stuff is because the very\n  existence of societal inequalities (against women, racial\n  minorities, gender/sexual minorities) threatens the whole\n  idea that hackers got where they are because they are\n  super-fucking-smart. A lot of what we call luck boils\n  down to us being in groups that dont face discrimination\n  and other problems.\n</code></pre>\nSource:\n<a href=""http://www.dailydot.com/society/github-code-search-racism-sexism-bigotry/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailydot.com/society/github-code-search-racism-se...</a>",1359746925

That informant is always talking about drinking and telling you how you should drink, and then they supply you with all the liquor you could handle. Then the informant mentions you really ought to head home, why not drive? The minute you get into the car and start to drive, the authorities show up and arrest you, as they have been watching you covertly for several months while the informant does his work. Oh, and they likely selected you based on your skin color and/or religious affiliation.<p>> Whether the bomb or not was real doesn't change the fact that he has the mens rea to blow up a building, and considering he thought the bomb was real and took positive steps to set it up, the reus actus as well.<p>While this is true, some of the cases to date the FBI has prosecuted are really likely to have never occurred if informants weren't being paid to intentionally push someone towards an illegal act.

If HN wanted to use context menus for some app-specific reason, all of those options would be wiped out (at least for affected elements) because the app would be in direct conflict with the browser.<p>Touch events are often another casualty -- sometimes they are commands to the OS (swipe to change active desktop), sometimes to the browser (pinch to zoom), sometimes to the app (drag to drag around a map, or maybe pinch to zoom?).<p>Additional layers always introduce problems and cause things at the end of the chain to have worse UX or adapt by using lowest common denominator. A crazy example: gmail running in browser running in windows running in a windows VM running on a mac machine which is remotely connected via VNC from an android tablet. >:D Android -> VNC app -> OSX -> VMWare -> Windows -> IE -> GMail app. Ok, this doesn't illustrate much besides the point that browser _is_ an element of input chain (that makes a disproportionate effect on UX too -- the other links are at least trying to be transparent), I just like the idea. :)",1359745303

5152626,comment,5152298,5152298,-2,0,davidpayne11,,,"There is a very thin line between being a feminist and being an asshole. The problem with these women, who claim to be angered by women being treated as objects is that they don't identify the real problem.<p>Women are attracted to men and men are attracted to women. This is basic nature and no one can change it. Using either to sell a product is not exactly sexism. For example, many deodorants use both male and female models to promote their products.<p>Sexism in my definition would be when given the same opportunity, when one gender is being paid or treated better than another gender, that would be sexism, because someone is being treated <i>unfair</i>.<p>What hypermac (the company in question) did was not wrong. They hired models who were for god's sake ready to do it. They were ready to accept money and stand nude on their product exhibit. It would have been unfair if they were treated unfair, or against their will, none of which had happened.<p>The real problem about women being objectified is that women are ready to be objectified - either for money or for some other form of compromise. This is the real problem. As long as such women exist, the product makers and corporations would obviously use them. So, if you want this to stop, you have to revolt when someone from your own gender (male/female) is ready to represent your gender infront of a public audience and accept to be objectified for money. Don't go after the corporation that hired them, instead ask these people why they let them objectify you, on behalf of you/your gender in the first place. This is the real problem.<p>I love the way that these rogue women go after men (and vice versa) only because they want an apology to feel superior and write a blog post about it.<p>I think it must have been a great marketing campaign for HyperMac and the guy was right - These people deserved no apology for this particular event and this particular event alone (please don't generalize this conclusion).<p>There's a great saying - <i>Any publicity is good publicity</i>. I hope these feminists realize this and stop fucking themselves up like this, publicly.",1359745275

A site is often the first impression of a company, and if I came across this on my own I would have immediately left.<p>Some things right off the top of my head:<p>- Don't use a giant 650kb image for the main content block. This can be broken down a lot into smaller images and css. I would even have a sign up form or large sign up button as part of this block too.<p>- Use sans-serif fonts, I usually go with something like Open Sans<p>- Don't use grey text on a grey background. I would maybe put a white background for the middle 960px of the page to give more focus to the content.<p>Hope this helps a bit, and if you have questions or want some more advice feel free to message me.",1359745269

On top of that, it's legal. And once you've rooted/jailbroken your phone, how many services will you continue to use that are hosted on someone else's hardware, using closed source software? The software to host yourself is available, it's just not well integrated yet. Also, the lockin to things like FB is a not insurmountable, but difficult problem.",1359745215

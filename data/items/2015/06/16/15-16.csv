9726733,comment,9725288,9725288,0,0,brudgers,,,"Like the general trolly problem, this formulation of the self-driving car problem assumes some agents are passive. The trolly problem assumes nobody is trying to rescue the potential victims. This formulation of the self-driving car problem assumes the school bus and other vehicles are passive.<p>Thus the conventional trolly problem doesn&#x27;t really do the problem of self-driving car decision trees justice. The school bus isn&#x27;t a dumb trolly. When your car is heading toward the school bus, the school bus will also running down it&#x27;s decision tree and the best outcome based on its 15 passengers may be to take you out directly rather than run the risk of miscalculating what will happen if your car dives into the guardrail. Which is to say, that statistical predictions bring confidence intervals into play.<p>I believe this is why trolly problems in general reveal more about their formulation than about our ethical reasoning. We will throw a switch to shunt the trolly because the bad outcome will remain in the future and the possibility of changing circumstances remains very real. We know from experience that any of our predictions may be fallible and that the more temporally remote the event the more our prediction is fallible. Pushing the fat man off the bridge elicits a different reaction: the outcome is immediate and our prediction less fallible.",1434470382

His first production in the UK was Waiting… in 1956, a project born out of a desire to film Samuel Beckett’s stage play “Waiting for Godot”. Beckett however, was unhappy with the textual changes Gadyukin proposed and withheld permission for an adaptation. Gadyukin’s film is a testament to his ability to tread a fine line, being very close to Beckett’s play in places but always with sufficient alterations to avoid a lawsuit. Waiting… was both experimental in narrative and formal terms, much of the dialogue being a mix of English and Esperanto.

This is not a &quot;major&quot; problem, because those people are a tiny minority.<p>2. This is not a problem with the BMI itself; it&#x27;s a problem with the &quot;healthy BMI range&quot; interpretation of the BMI value. Obviously, this range does not apply to special populations, like muscular athletes or people with missing limbs.<p>The BMI concept is valuable because it expresses weight in a way that normalizes for height. The BMI value is only as useful as raw body mass, but at least generalizes to different heights.<p>A better tool than anything derived from body mass (such as BMI) is a tape measure around your waist: keep your waist circumference less than around 40% of your height. That&#x27;s it. For instance if you&#x27;re 68 inches tall, you should have a 27&quot; or narrower waist.<p>For BMI, by the way, I use the improved BMI formula: 1.3 * mass / (height ^ 2.5). The standard BMI&#x27;s power of two gives taller adults excessively high BMI values, and is more lenient on shorter people.<p><a href=""https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/bmi_calc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/bmi_calc.html</a>",1434470163

9726693,comment,9725580,9726270,0,0,mbell,,,"> Yeah, that&#x27;s how science works.<p>The problem is that various sciences have very different requirements for what constitutes a valid &#x27;discovery&#x27;. e.g. In particle physics if you don&#x27;t have a 5 sigma result you haven&#x27;t really found something. You often see incredibly weak data accepted into journals in the soft sciences, see the recent &#x27;chocolate makes you thin&#x27; faux study as an example.<p>I think there is a large problem in soft sciences in that they are very quick to declare knowledge with very limited data supporting it. The various dietary sciences are probably the worst offenders at the moment. As you&#x27;ve said we know very little about nutrition and health, so why are we so quick to make definitive statements about it? That sounds like the opposite of science to me.<p>I&#x27;m sure this will be controversial but I&#x27;d rather not classify such &#x27;soft sciences&#x27; as science at all. I&#x27;ve seen several complete reversals in soft sciences in my life and think that this actually contributes to the general public&#x27;s mis-understanding and mis-trust of science as a whole. e.g. &quot;Those scientists can&#x27;t even figure out what I&#x27;m supposed to eat so why would I believe this quantum physics non-sense!&quot;",1434470111

You can tell this, because it is widely believed the book is about a low-carb diet, or how bad carbs are. It&#x27;s a misunderstanding that&#x27;s understandable between the cover and the name, and heck, even the publisher-provided blurbs on Amazon, but what the book is actually about, by bulk of words, is the story of how the standard nutritional consensus got to be such garbage in the first place. It is primarily a <i>history</i> book, rather than a science work.<p>There is a <i>very</i> good case to be made that the science <i>never</i> supported what we were told, and that it was sourced in naked political power plays. When, of course, the consensus was still the Standard Consensus, that was not an argument that the body politic could hear, but as it becomes increasingly clear that the Standard Consensus was in fact wrong [1], it becomes an increasingly important book.<p>Nutrition <i>is</i> hard, and we&#x27;ll be studying it for decades more. But it is <i>not</i> so hard that it was simply expect that we should be this fundamentally wrong, and more importantly, this wrong for <i>this long</i>. This took <i>effort</i>, and if we refuse to study what happened, we&#x27;ll learn nothing from it. If indeed it the standard consensus is wrong, the signal telling us it was wrong was STAGGERINGLY ENORMOUS. We call it the &quot;obesity epidemic&quot;. The only comparably sized epidemiological signal that comes to mind is the one that said &quot;Lead is bad to put in the air.&quot; Those who ignored it are the ones who owe us apologies.<p>If you&#x27;re even beginning to <i>suspect</i> that the standard consensus is wrong, I highly recommend getting yourself a copy and reading it. The science is a bit outdated now... the history, as is the nature of history, is not.<p>[1]: I phrase it that way because I&#x27;m still hedged a bit on my bets, though &quot;The standard consensus was very wrong&quot; is getting pretty high on my Bayes-O-Meter, even as I&#x27;m not really bought in to any of its replacements yet.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s worth pointing out that in previous HN discussions on these sorts of topics I&#x27;ve always been a bit more circumspect; my Bayes-O-Meter was merely in the &quot;highly suspicious&quot; range. But with the announcement from the government that they are <i>actively reversing</i> something previously issues forth as &quot;truth&quot;, I&#x27;ve finally tipped over in outright ideologue on the topic. For the record, this is actually a considered decision, not brute emotionality or fad-following. It is also, for what it&#x27;s worth, the exact reaction that I&#x27;m accusing these people of trying to avoid. They are trying to avoid exactly the anger I&#x27;m expressing here from becoming widespread, but if I&#x27;m correct, the anger would be fully justified, and the only honorable thing for them to do is to go ahead and incur the anger instead of holding us back. As you can see, I&#x27;m still hedging a <i>bit</i> with conditional phrases, but at this point I&#x27;m having an increasingly difficult time imagining that we&#x27;re suddenly going to get a spate of (honest) studies re-confirming the standard consensus.<p>And to be clear... I&#x27;m not asking for them to be <i>right</i>. That would be an unfairly large request. I&#x27;m asking for them to stop being so aggressively <i>wrong</i>.",1434469469

From my perception, once you buy into the App store, you&#x27;re bound to its limited upgrade routine. This has bitten me plenty of times on iOS, where the developer doesn&#x27;t feel like keeping up with iOS upgrades, leaving you with broken apps with no ability to get them working again. I&#x27;m not talking about fly-by-night developers, but AAA developers like Capcom.",1434469145

Do you mean a ORM?&quot; It&#x27;s common having an object relational mapping to interact with relational database content in an object oriented way. Likewise, Apey Eye also offers an object oriented approach to manage data in entire flow of requests handling, from Models (our DB/ORM classes) to Resources (in the REST sense), through an object-resource mapping where objects have methods that map to get, post, put, patch and delete methods, for a resource/ or resource/:id/ url. Generally speaking, static methods correspond to HTTP methods you’d call on &quot;resource/&quot; and instance methods correspond to HTTP methods you’d call on &quot;resource/:id&quot;. Furthermore, this object oriented approach allow entities like Model and Resource to have be used imperatively, making it easier to use them in other contexts, like unit testing.",1434469118

There are plenty of father-son teams who hit a rough patch in the labor market and go off and do exactly that.  Not everyone who does so is properly equipped or knows how to use the equipment safely, and most are familiar with only a limited subset of the techniques required to do a job correctly.  Many are desperate and will take on jobs they cannot do safely (or with the results the landowner wants!).<p>Harvesters are great but they are not necessary to do a safe, neat, and professional logging job, nor are they appropriate to every job.  The conduct you describe and the fact that you mentioned alcohol and macho behavior are strong evidence that the crew you hired, however experienced, is not competent and has no business logging.  Logging will always be dangerous work regardless of the equipment used, but there&#x27;s no excuse for adding to the danger through amateurish and foolish practices.<p>A professional logging company will employ loggers who work as safely as possible, equip them with the right tools, and ensure they are properly trained in correct procedures and the use of those tools.  Those things cost money, and the low barriers to entry and limited employment opportunities in many forested areas mean there is always plenty of cheap competition.  Landowners don&#x27;t have much incentive to seek out more safety-conscious logging companies.  Even if a landowner has a bad experience with one company, it is usually many years before they hire loggers again, making it difficult to punish a sloppy or unsafe company by taking the business elsewhere.  So accidents tend to put a small-scale, unprofessional logger out of business before the market does, and that&#x27;s a significant contributor to the accident rate.",1434468925

Years ago, we learned about the health risks of saturated fats and moved away from them. More recently, we learned about the risks of trans fats and are now moving away from them. The people at the Center for whatever are updating their position based on the latest findings rather than sticking to outdated facts that have been disproven. I wish more policy-makers would do that.<p>Our knowledge and understanding of the totality of nutrition and health is still pretty small, in part because there are lots of interacting components and because many aspects of nutrition are correlated with ethnicity and lifestyle. Nonetheless, it has been demonstrated that trans fats are bad for your health, independent of other factors.

My problem is this:<p>I love scrolling web pages, this is how I can reach the content at the bottom :) I also happen to love the pixel-smooth scrolling of OS X and I mainly use 13&quot; laptops, so the vertical space is scarce.<p>The latest improvements in CSS, particularly the introduction of position:fixed has been slowly ruining the web, in my opinion. Try scrolling down this page, for example: 
http://www.millcreekplaces.com/community/zilkr-on-the-park-apartments-in-austin<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous. The &quot;parallax&quot; effect makes it even worse: retina displays can barely handle regular scrolling - they&#x27;re noticeably more laggy than non-retina on a same screen size, but parallax completely destroys the experience: Not only I can&#x27;t see much because of &quot;stuck&quot; headers/footers, but the smoothness of scrolling is gone as well.<p>THE question: are you aware of browser plug-ins that help fight this insanity?

I am a statistician that applies machine learning methods a handful of times per year. That to say --- I find Bayes rule to be eerily similar to the way I think a human mind learns. We operate with degrees of belief, we couple those beliefs with new information and update our beliefs. The word taxonomy is heavily loaded, ultimately I&#x27;d say if AI were taken to it&#x27;s logical end it would actually produce a human brain. Let me explain. Consider a map of your city as a model. If that map contained every drain, street lamp, and stop sign --- it wouldn&#x27;t be a very useful map. It would be so detailed that it would be overwhelming and a poor tool for navigating a city. That&#x27;s why we use maps, lower-order abstractions. But imagine that a map were your city. That it was your city shrunk down so that you could hold it in your hand. Would it be a model? A map? Would it be your city? Of course this is a fantasy, but the way I see AI is the map. AI researchers are working to convert that map to the actual city with the goal of actually learning about the human mind. So I think rather than giving a glib answer about categorizing the human mind, I&#x27;ll just say that the category is whatever &#x27;map&#x27; AI researchers end up with when we agree that what they&#x27;ve created is a human mind. :-)<p>Edit: for those interested, here are some slides that mention &#x27;no free lunch&#x27;: <a href=""http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~mike/ml4as/11/l00-2x2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~mike/ml4as/11/l00-2x2.pdf</a>",1429476310

It&#x27;s far from obvious that it can, and this point needs justification.<p>Fair enough.<p>>Computers can only run Turing complete programs. Human intelligence follows the physical laws of the universe (the mechanism being unknown).
Those two substrates are different things; hence it&#x27;s possible that humans can do things computers can&#x27;t. Or at least the burden of proof is on the person who posits that they are equivalent.<p>The Churchâ€“Turing thesis directly says that computers can do anything humans can, and it&#x27;s pretty well accepted.<p>Physical laws, as far as we can tell, <i>are</i> Turing computable. I think once you accept the materialistic thesis you should agree that computers can in theory simulate humans, and I&#x27;m not really too interested in the opinion on this of anyone who rejects the materialistic thesis.<p>(Penrose has tried to argue that computation depends on QM, but I think he&#x27;s been largely disproven.)<p>>We have the facility to use computers to achieve our goals, but AI algorithms don&#x27;t use us to achieve their goals, to the extent that they have goals.<p>Why couldn&#x27;t they? Why couldn&#x27;t an AI convince someone to do what they want?<p>>For a concrete task: consider producing a movie that will win an Oscar. In theory this is possible: the Godfather has a very limited number of bits, all of which can fit on a single computer many times over. The bits could just be manufactured it out of thin air.
>In practice I suspect a computer would need physical agency in the world to create such a movie. It would need the ability to negotiate with Hollywood producers to raise funding; to make creative decisions to direct people who operate cameras, microphones, lighting, etc.<p>Assuming it had access to an internet dump, it could download thousands of existing movies, determine what characteristics are likely to win Oscars, and generate voice and picture based on previous videos. Voice can definitely be generated using information already online, and video should be possible to patch together from existing movies and pictures.<p>>Computers don&#x27;t yet have physical agency, and I suspect they won&#x27;t for quite some time, for both technological and non-technological reasons.<p>See <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/07/no-physical-substrate-no-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/07/no-physical-substrate-n...</a>.<p>About Roko&#x27;s basilisk: Yudkowsky does not take the idea seriously.

(By the way, I don&#x27;t think this involves much conscious malice; it&#x27;s just one of the bugs you get when primates have to build a civilization from scratch.)

9404678,comment,9402409,9403408,0,0,ktsmith,,,">  Of course, the term &quot;hyperfocus&quot; does not appear in ADHD medical literature or any ADHD studies.<p>Hyperfocus has been used generically to refer to one of the negative effects of a lack of self-control and self-regulation in the executive ability of ADHD individuals. This has been the case for at least the last 15 years. Both inattentiveness and excessive focus are thought to be caused by a lack of dopamine which the stimulant drugs counteract.<p>> The single best approach to dealing with this is to pursue constant discipline and self-monitoring, in order to train yourself back to a healthier mental process.<p>There is no single best approach. Different approaches will work for different people. I can only speak for myself but no amount of pursuing discipline and self-monitoring on its own worked for me. Rescuetime, getting things done, pomodoros, daily self evaluation... didn&#x27;t make an iota of difference before I went to my Dr and got a diagnosis. The combination of Vyvanse and these techniques has made a difference, though I&#x27;ve eliminated the pomodoros as it just flat out doesn&#x27;t work for me.<p>> So my advice would be to make efforts to structure your life in ways to minimize distractions and hold yourself accountable for your results.<p>Easier said than done. Structure is incredibly important but, at least for me, anything can be a distraction. The soft blue glow of the led on my monitors power button is a distraction. The difference in textures of the keys on the keyboard is a distraction, getting suddenly lost in thought or mentally stepping through what I need to do instead of doing it is a problem.<p>Figuring out what works best for you as an individual is important. I actually work much better with noise in the background so long as it&#x27;s fairly consistent. Electronic or classical music is pretty good for this for me but at times can be too repetitive and then that becomes a distraction. Music with lyrics is generally better for me so long as the volume isn&#x27;t too high and I&#x27;m already familiar with the songs. This also usually ties directly into the constant motion of my legs. I&#x27;ve been a leg bouncer for my entire life, especially when I need to do something intense like test taking in school or working on a complex algorithm at work.<p>The addition of medication to my daily life has allowed me to cut out some of the inputs I was giving too much attention to. When I&#x27;m locked in on something and someone interrupts me I actually hear them now rather than what would previously look like I was just flat out ignoring them. That ability to not switch tasks when I want to, and switch tasks voluntarily when I need to was absolutely life changing for me. I don&#x27;t take my medication all of the time, in part to cut down on the tolerance and in part because I&#x27;d prefer not to take it forever. Having been on it has helped me be more aware of what I&#x27;m doing and catch myself in certain bad habits I&#x27;ve formed; however, if I&#x27;m locked into something and my wife walks up and starts talking I won&#x27;t notice and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any amount of structure or discipline that will change things like that. The positive is that we are both aware of what is going on, she knows how to break me out of it better, a light touch, and it no longer is a source of arguments.<p>> Realize that everyone is distracted in modern life, but that&#x27;s not necessarily indicative of a disease. Stimulant medications are not to be taken lightly, and you&#x27;re best avoiding them long-term if possible.<p>I agree that stimulant medicine isn&#x27;t something to mess around with or view as a quick solution to get more done. I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair or even good to try to say that everyone is distracted or it&#x27;s just part of modern life. ADHD is probably over diagnosed because people are looking for a quick fix and going to their Drs with a list of things to say in order to get drugs. Just like with painkillers. If someone is going to their Dr and honestly thinks they may have ADHD or are getting a child evaluated I would find a different Dr if their first recommendation is medication, or if the Dr comes to that conclusion very quickly. I also wouldn&#x27;t necessarily try to scare people away from trying them if there&#x27;s a legitimate problem. I wish I had been diagnosed as a child or that I had the sense to talk to my Dr sooner.",1429474378

I do recall buying balloons wet with saliva, but only some of the time. An acquaintance told me that it used to be standard practice for dealers to use young Mexican children to sell dope by this method on foot in Skid Row, but that the city had really cleaned up downtown. With the popularization of cell phones, the delivery system described in this article became the standard.<p>Higher quality heroin was usually sold by the half gram. Instead of being in a balloon, it would be wrapped in plastic torn from a grocery bag, tied off or melted to close and seal it. I don&#x27;t recall these ever being spat out. They would often hide it under the hood in their beat up trucks or minivans.<p>I never got customer satisfaction surveys from dealers. I&#x27;m sure that the dealers had customers or friends from whom they got feedback on their product, but I was never one of them.<p>A dealer&#x27;s number was quite a hot commodity. You couldn&#x27;t just call the dealer up and expect to get servedâ€”you had to be introduced. And the dealer would often throw in a free bag if you bought x number of them.<p>The result of this was that one user would have the dealer&#x27;s contact information, and would make a buying run for other users who didn&#x27;t. If they bought enough they could keep the free bag, or otherwise pinch off the bags that they acquired for the other users.",1429473942

AM doesn&#x27;t try to be something it&#x27;s not - there is a roll off starting around 4 kHz, but it&#x27;s fine for talk radio and music just sounds dull, which is fine.  XM sounds &quot;bright&quot; in that it has HF content, but it&#x27;s distorted and &quot;warbley&quot; for lack of a better word.  It sounds like the the HF is passed through a filter of moving water or a fan or something.",1429473631

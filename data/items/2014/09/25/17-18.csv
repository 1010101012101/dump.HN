I see &quot;geoSystem: &#x27;WGS84&#x27;&quot; which isn&#x27;t an EPGS identifier. Along those lines, are distance calculations done on a geodesic, a plane, or is that configurable (some projections are a planer, others aren&#x27;t).<p>Also, what does this mean? geometry.distance(geometry[, {geoSystem: &#x27;WGS84&#x27;, unit: &#x27;m&#x27;}])  Does this do a correct interpolation of degrees to meters along the path (again based on the projection) or is there a fixed constant?<p>EDIT: Are there commands to export WKT or WKB?",1411667982

8368554,comment,8368174,8368174,6,0,nagi2k4,,,"Something worth noting is that FATCA essentially makes it impossible for an institution to remain &quot;FATCA compliant&quot; if they have any financial relationship with a non-compliant entity. Sure, they can have such relationships, but the U.S. Treasury department can then impose a 30% penalty on any transaction that passes through a U.S. bank. Given that the vast majority of international payments are made in USD, that 30% penalty is going to be very painful for any bank that purposefully decides to be non-compliant.<p>The end result of that will be that the global financial system is going to be bifurcated into &quot;compliant&quot; and &quot;non-compliant&quot; institutions.  Believe me, most banks/insurance companies/financial entities will find it worth their while to eventually become compliant.<p>The reason that more countries aren&#x27;t complaining about this (and most are actually entering into bilateral enforcement agreements with the U.S. Treasury department) is that they&#x27;ll then be able to get access to the same sorts of information on their own citizens that the U.S. is getting on their own as a result of FATCA.",1411667972

8368281,comment,8366745,8367682,2,0,IshKebab,,,"I have no sympathy really for people who use `system()`-style calls, or bash in their web servers. Bash is fairly obviously designed with complete disregard for security. I <i>seriously</i> doubt this is its last major flaw.<p>But anyway, is it really that common? I would have thought most CGI scripts are Python, Perl, PHP, etc. and don&#x27;t use `system()` type calls. Right?",1411665443

Your question is asked and answered here:  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26022248/is-the-behavior-behind-this-vulnerability-documented-or-at-all-intentional"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26022248/is-the-behavior...</a>  The answer given there is that the behavior is NOT a documented feature; it&#x27;s a side-effect of how bash implements inherited functions.<p>I was also very confused about why a web server would need to store HTTP headers in environment variables.  Why would a mature piece of software like Apache do something so hackish?  The explanation turns out to be very simple:  it&#x27;s how CGI works.  Headers are passed to the CGI script as environment variables.  If you don&#x27;t do it that way, you don&#x27;t support CGI.<p>There&#x27;s one thing that still confuses me, though:  why would a CGI implementation use the shell to set environment variables?  Why would you use a complex, idiosyncratic piece of software that comes in many different flavors instead of just using the C setenv function?",1411665441

Google responded by quoting Yelp, who has said that the algorithm changes have not harmed Yelp (aka, an independent 3rd party is also disputing News Corp&#x27;s claims).<p>As for the Android Google Play lockin allegations, what more is there for Google to say? Android is open source and usable by anyone, this is simple fact. Google even calls out Amazon and Nokia doing exactly this. There literally does not exist a certification process for Android-related products. There exists a certification process if you want <i>GOOGLE PLAY</i>, but not if you just want Android.",1411664674

For me, your comments sound a lot like libertarianism turned into religion. A lot of dogmas that sound nice, but are trivially easy to be shown false.<p>To respond to a particular point,<p>> <i>Not having to compete with anyone does not make a product cheaper, it makes it more expensive. Competition drives prices down. So the government having a monopoly over a service makes that service more expensive.</i><p>True in many cases, especially if you only care about end-buyer price, but false in others. Some things fail spectacularly when you make them competitive. Things like basic research, things like exploiting a limited pool of shared resources, things like schools and prisons - they all go to hell when you try to run them on free-market rules. Some would say medicare is another similar thing. The market price is not the only important metric; some others are: quality, accessibility, efficiency, externalities.<p>> <i>Advertising is not a waste of resources, it is investment of resources - literally, money spent buying leads in order to try and convert them into customers.</i><p>Who, were you not to convert them, would go to the competitor. It&#x27;s a total waste of resources - you spend money (and more importantly, fuel and man-hours) trying to one-up your competitor, he does the same; on average, you still get the same amount of clients, only both of you wasted resources on a stupid zero-sum game. You&#x27;d both be better off if you agreed to not run any more ads that it take for people to discover you exist; yet since you can&#x27;t agree on that, you&#x27;re stuck in a zero-sum game.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.raikoth.net/libertarian.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raikoth.net/libertarian.html</a>",1411664527
8368195,comment,8359837,8367130,1,0,arketyp,,,"I am familiar with the gene-centered view of evolution proposed by Williams and popularized by Dawkins with the so-called selfish gene theory. Within this school of thought sexual selection by no means stands in contrast to natural selection and is not labeled an alternative to it. Instead, in fact, sexual selection is argued to be a direct consequence of natural selection as a phenomena you would expect with Darwinisitic reasoning when assuming the gene-centered view. As is made the case, the gene-centered view is the extension of Darwin&#x27;s original argument, that is, Darwin&#x27;s argument taken to its logical conclusion with the modern facts at hand, the DNA molecule not the least.<p>One of the central themes in Dawkins&#x27;s The Extended Phenotype is the putting into question of the validity of traditional role of the organism in Darwinistic reasoning and why Darwin&#x27;s original definition of fitness does not hold up. There is actually an entire segment on the many modern (back then) definitions of fitness and problems with each of them. I don&#x27;t recall what the final conclusion is but it is certain it is not the clear-cut case you make it.<p>I suppose you have background in a field where your definition of fitness is more firmly established. For instance, I know biological mathematics has come a long way, and I&#x27;m not up to speed with what definitions they are using.",1411664504

You&#x27;ve missed out a large number of possible ways this could be exploited, so the above advice would leave a lot of people vulnerable. Furthermore, because it&#x27;s such a common thing to pass environment variables and to invoke bash, people expect far more attack vectors to be discovered as this unfolds. In addition the current patches rely on huge swathes of bash code being bug-free, we&#x27;ve already seen one patch circumvented and with so many eyes suddenly on code that wasn&#x27;t closely inspected from a security angle for over two decades, I would bet on seeing far more things being found over the next weeks or months.",1411664405

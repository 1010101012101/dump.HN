5463917,comment,5457168,5463345,1,0,coldtea,,,"As if that matters one iota.<p>For one, it's merely one of around 20 steps you have to take in either case anyway (steps like: type url, press enter to goto page, wait for page to load, click through some license staff, click to start to play, click for fullscreen if you want, wait for assets and loading, click game settings, suffer through the intro, read help for the game controls, etc). So, yes, you might get rid of one measly step -- all the while introducing other steps, lags and inefficiencies.<p>Second, this step buys you freedom from having the program run on somebody else's mercy. Of course for networked games and apps with central servers you cannot avoid it.<p>But I would sure as hell like to avoid it for any program that doesn't need a central server. I don't want to use ""Photoshop in the browser"" and loose all my stuff when Adobe decides to lock me out or kill the service a la Google Reader. Plus have it be susceptible to internet outages, slowdowns, and using technologies and speeds that's 2-3 generations behind a native app. Not all programs gain from running on the browser. A lot of them lose.",1364605184

I'm 27 and just now finishing up my undergraduate degree (at a top 10 US university) as I took several years doing various startup stuff and working. Most of my friends have already been done with their degrees for a while -- a very small minority work in start-ups. The start-up world is NOT for most people. To be successful (which I am not, don't get me wrong) you have to be very smart and technical, but you also need luck, good timing, and (most importantly) persistence.<p>In many ways, the start-up world is like professional body-building. Sure genes can help (genius prodigy 16 year old goes to MIT), but what really makes you a winner is persistence. Also, steroids can't hurt (connections in the Valley).<p>Most college students are NOT fit for the start-up world. At all.

5463903,comment,5459216,5462102,2,0,georgecmu,,,"<i>Inflation is not a general rise in the prices of goods; prices going up is merely one symptom of inflation.
Inflation is the expansion of the monetary base.</i><p>OK, so since we're discussing inflation as an economics concept, it only makes sense as long as we keep to the economics definition of inflation. If you want to use your own definition, you're free to do so, but then the discussion leaves the mainstream economics domain, and you should be clear about that.<p>Definitions:<p><a href=""http://economics.about.com/cs/economicsglossary/g/inflation.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economics.about.com/cs/economicsglossary/g/inflation....</a>
Inflation is an increase in the price of a basket of goods and services that is representative of the economy as a whole.<p><a href=""http://economics.about.com/od/helpforeconomicsstudents/f/inflation.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economics.about.com/od/helpforeconomicsstudents/f/inf...</a>
A similar definition of inflation can be found in Economics by Parkin and Bade:
Inflation is an upward movement in the average level of prices. Its opposite is deflation, a downward movement in the average level of prices. The boundary between inflation and deflation is price stability.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation</a>
In economics, inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.[1] When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services.<p>How is inflation measured? Using Consumer Price Index:
<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm</a><p><i>Printing dollars, for example, is inflation. The increase in prices is a result of inflation, and there are numerous effects other than prices going up.</i><p>According to whom?<p><i>It's critical in economics to separate supply & demand of goods causing increases or decreases in prices, from monetary changes. Free market forces are not the same as central bank forces.</i><p>Doesn't seem relevant.<p><i>There's about 200 years of modern economic evidence for how exactly inflation works and how central banks create it.</i><p>This would be a perfect place to cite some of that evidence.<p><i>I'll ignore the fact that the Fed has openly admitted it has devalued the dollar by 97% since its founding.</i><p>That's fine; I'm not sure what any sort of 'admission' may have to do with an argument at hand.<p><i>I'll also ignore the fact that Bernanke recently said it was the goal of the Fed to generate asset inflation via QE aka debasing the dollar (see real estate skyrocketing 10% again, or 22% in Phoenix (a disaster market recently), see stocks at all time highs again ala 2007).</i><p>No one argues that Fed can influence money supply, which can (hopefully) have effect on inflation. The relation is far from direct, however. Think of effects of other factors, for example increases in savings rate or decreases in productivity.<p><i>I'll also ignore the fact that Greenspan openly admitted the Fed has the direct ability to increase or decrease inflation, and can cause bubbles or pop them. He of all people should know.</i><p>This pesky ""admission"" concept again -- what does it have to do with anything? Copernicus admitted that earth did not revolve around the sun, he of all people should know.<p><i>It's not an assertion, it's a fact supported by extreme amounts of data.</i><p>And that's another assertion, so far also unsubstantiated.<p><i>If you increase the monetary base and money supply by hundreds of percent over a relatively short period of time, you're going to see a substantial increase in the price of goods in the currency in question. If you 'print' dollars to buy trillions in mortgages and remove them from the market, you're going to limit supply of housing and cause approximately $3 to $4 trillion worth of inflation in just one year (what's happening right now). </i><p>Isn't inflation measured in percent, not in trillions of $?<p><i>Not to mention simultaneously holding down mortgage rates via the government dominated mortgage market, by holding short term and long term interest rates artificially low by buying the paper that influences that. Then when consumers sell their homes, or take home equity loans, and then spend in any manner or buy anything else or loan their money to banks - the inflation gets discharged directly into the economy.</i><p>Not sure what ""inflation gets discharged directly into the economy"" means.<p><i>This is one simple example, there are countless. If today you have one trillion dollars, and tomorrow the Fed prints another trillion dollars, it's obvious what happens.</i><p>Actually, it's far from obvious. Unfortunately, we'll never know what would really happen, as Fed is not in the business of <i>printing</i> trillions of dollars. In any case, here's analysis of what would happen that somewhat goes along your apocalyptic scenario: <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/deficits-and-the-printing-press-somewhat-wonkish/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/deficits-and-the...</a><p><i>So not only do I have vast empirical economic proof not only do I have historical evidence for how it all works, not only do I have obvious math theory that is as simple as addition and subtraction, but I have the Fed openly admitting the scale of the inflation it has caused.</i><p>So far all you had were words.<p><i>How many proof articles would you like on the topic?</i><p>So far you failed to produce a single one.",1364604981

5463896,comment,5462343,5463160,1,0,betterunix,,,"""Gold was seized by Roosevelt with Executive Order 6102 to prevent people from using gold as a currency""<p>That is not accurate.  People were hoarding gold at the time, which was harming the economy.  Gold currency was taken out of circulation by the government and replaced by a currency less prone to hoarding.  Hoarding stopped because people were given money that was not worth hoarding -- which is a good thing for the economy.<p>""today physical gold has been bought by millions of people as a hedge against the world financial crisis""<p>Which is not a currency, any more than a building, a field, or a gun is currency.<p>""On these occasions and more people would use gold as a currency if they weren't prevented by law""<p>Nobody in this century is prevented from using gold as a currency, just like nobody is prevented from using Bitcoin as a currency.  The only difference is that gold is not legal tender.  People tend to gravitate towards legal tender as a currency, probably because people live in a society governed by laws and need to legally repay their debts (taxes and others).",1364604871

Lyft and Sidecar have nothing available or have ungodly wait times (6-15 minutes while standing in a busy part of the city), while an Uber can pick me up in under 2-3 minutes every time. Additionally, a lot of Lyft/Sidecar drivers will just pass on rides that are too far away and wait until someone closer makes a request. They can do this because the demand is significantly greater than supply, so it has little impact on them. This is very obvious by just watching the display while you're trying to flag down a ride (note: true even with 5* rating).<p>This makes me wonder if they should even be included as they're incredibly unreliable.

Toss them in the trash and the debt will keep growing, whether through interest or collection fees etc., and you will keep garnering ill will to a point where resolving the problem later will become substantially harder.<p>On the other hand, most creditors will be prepared to cut your bills substantially if you demonstrate to them that you genuinely can't pay. Generally you can negotiate frozen interests, substantial cuts in the bills and payment plans very easily. This applies both to your personal circumstances, and your business. You have substantial leverage because they know they risk getting peanuts in a bankruptcy.<p>My first company had a really tough period due in part to changing market circumstances, and in part due to our lack of financial control in the beginning (none of us had business experience when we started... Hard learning curve). When I started cleaning house, one of the first things I did was to establish a list of all our debts, and call each and every creditor to describe the exact situation - how much we owed in total, our current revenues and projections and expenses, and made them an offer:<p>They'd cut their debt to 25% of the original claim, and freeze interest, and we'd resume payments. In some cases we'd convert assets we'd bought into leases with the same company, but at similar rates. Some argued. Some were angry - for good reason (some <i>had</i> been subjected to the ""toss them in the trash"" idea by guy who looked after the finances before I took that task on too, on top of managing our servers, and were furious they'd heard nothing). Some tried to get preferential treatment.<p>But in the end every single one accepted, because they could see from the numbers that it was the most we could afford and because they knew we were treating them fairly from our insistence on , and they also all knew that a customer in a tough spot that cleans house and makes a best effort offer like that will be damn grateful, and if they make it through, will keep bringing them business.<p>(We did make it through, and most of those creditors made a good chunk of money on us in the long run.)",1364603884

There are examples of probability systems that try to factor in uncertainty, beyond truth belief or false belief.  I think it was possibility theory that was talking about a 0.5 value assigned to ""the cat is alive"", a 0.2 value assigned to ""the cat is dead"", and a 0.3 uncertainty - then it would be 0.8 plausibility/possibility of alive, but only 0.5 probability.<p>The main distinction I saw about subjectivist vs objectivist is that the objectivist still communicates in terms of degree of belief, but the belief is that it is based on objective empirical data and so therefore it's not an expression of <i>personal</i> belief - more a measure of belief for the entire system or knowledge base.  More relevant for things like machine learning rather than updating ones own personal beliefs.  (Maybe this just assumes common priors.)<p>I've gone round and round on fuzzy because some people talk about fuzzy as if it is degrees-of-belief, like the bayesian interpretation.

From there it is inertia for a while, then the cycle starts again.<p>Hollywood may have some responsibility in shaping some people expectation of love but I don't think this is much related to online dating being broken.

About two years ago I got my mom to sign up for OkCupid (a few years after her divorce) and the biggest problem I encountered was her reluctance to be open. People are afraid to put any identifying information or any information that deviates from the public image they maintain at work and in social circles. This basically sets themselves up for failure because connecting with the right people for you really is dependent on both parties being open enough to find real connections. Jeff Jarvis I think has given one of the best talks on the value of openness.

If you're commenting on your friends' profiles, they'll naturally want to comment on yours. All of the comments on my profile happened not because I asked my friends to do that, but because I started out by commenting on theirs.<p>With the stigma, it's largely an issue skewed by age.

If it were a local statistic to the USA then one could argue that when the weather is bad people stay in at the weekends and drink more, then they miss breakfast on a Monday because they're hungover, then on Tuesday they resolve to better health and so eat breakfast cereals, they of course give up on Wednesday on the whole and the cycle repeats.<p>There are no real causes for imagined realities so there is no gain in asking - or answering - the question if it is indeed made up.<p>It's entirely plausible that there is an explanation for a similarly absurd sounding but real statistic that relies on causation.<p>><i>you wouldn't be so quick to assume</i> //<p>You're right, I try not assume much but FWIW I only asked if it were sound or not, not if one were likely to do it.<p>You say it's ""biased"", I don't understand what you mean.

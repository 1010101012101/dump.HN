But somehow they're able to stay alive.  In SF, there's the Hat factory & Citizen Space.  I've only been to Citizen Space as a non-paying resident, but it amazes me how those places manage to survive in general.",1230346443

Unless you live in a city with a really good selection of restaurants, it often means cooking all your own food and drastically changing your diet.  I personally avoid all of: sugar/substitutes, hydrogenated oils, MSG/yeast extract, homogonized milk, refined grains, artificial colors/sweeteners, anything where oils are heated above their smoke point.  I mainly eat raw fresh produce, whole grains, and organic meat.  I've come to enjoy cooking -- it's a useful skill, both pragmatically and socially.  :)<p>Some things frequently mentioned as having anti cancer properties are maca root, and tumeric, especially when combined with black pepper. (all raw.)  Some of the very high end multivitamin supplements that you find in health stores include these.  Frequent sunlight without sunscreen is important too.<p>In general, the natural health community's perspectives on many things are often counter to mainstream medicine's positions.  Be prepared to evaluate some core beliefs in  undertaking this research. :)",1230345842

It seems like I'd be more likely to use Amazon if the weather was beautiful because I'd rather not spend those days in the mall, since they're open 24 hours, but the whole thing hinges on fedex driving where you can't, which is weird to me.<p>Which is not to say that I question the premise of your comment, it's just that it seems like a bit of a nonsequitor in that while they correlate, it's not clear to me that there is a causal relationship at play, but then again, I've done no research, but as people have pointed out elsewhere, they are cheaper, and it seems that they are probably succeeding for the same reason Wal-Mart is.",1230345782

They are fun to drive, hold their value, and some of the higher-end models (e.g., the Passat) offer similar drive trains and handling for much less.  I've got a 4motion Passat wagon (4motion is exactly the same AWD system as Quattro) which cost several thousand dollars less than a (smaller cargo volume) A4 Avant.  It's not quite as nicely appointed, but has all of the luxuries that one really needs.  The VW Rabbit (and GTI, if you have a larger budget) is also a great vehicle.  The GTI is far superior to the A3 (hatchback version of the A4) in everything but price.",1230344336

But for all of them, the difference is less than depreciation on a new $50k car.  Ferrari is different of course, but $25k of depreciation (new car for 3 years) may cover even that.<p>The point is not that GT3 is a frugal choice, but that buying a new car is an extravagance, and for the same cost you could be driving a vastly better car.",1230343729

They only wanted to eat Chinese food morning, noon, and night.  I have found Chinese folks (especially anyone over the age of 40) to be highly inflexible in their dietary habits.  In every city we visited, although most of those cities had famous China towns, we simply could not satisfy them.  The food was never even half acceptable to them.<p>The trip was good from a business perspective.  But they all came back to Shanghai sorely disappointed in America's ability to feed them well ;).<p>As to General Tso?

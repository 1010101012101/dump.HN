I love reading what's written good, and immersing in a stream of the author's ideas, as they flow in a fluid way, slowly unfurling and settling in with me;  not necessarily to stay, but to be weighted, fondled and tinkered with -- definitely.<p>It is extremely unlikely that I would grow to appreciate books as I do now if I haven't been exposed to printed paper books in my being a small child.<p>Hate, unmoderated hate is what I have for those people.  ""Smell of books"".  Sheesh…  A word is a word, and you can read it from a screen.  It don't smell, it's indexable, searchable and resizable.   It's translatable (mechanically), and you can store tons of them in your pocket.<p>You just need to recognize that it matters how you read it -- don't just skim, immersion is something you yourself do.<p>Back to the vinil topic -- CDs are mastered with a resolution (in time) and depth (in percision) that is nowhere anywhere near vinil.  Some people are gifted in a way (I am, to some extent) to hear, feel and ""see"" a sound-scape emerging from a recording, and enjoy the music on many more levels then you'd think.  If you can't -- don't generalize from your own experience, people and minds come in all shapes and forms.<p>I'm willing to not be fussy about them ""smell of books"" people, let them have their books, printing, bookcases, dust, more dust and the fabulously smelling rot.  I won't like it, but hey, they might have something there, would any of them please explain how that works for them though?  I'd love to know.<p>And you <i>can</i> master a digital recording (going beyond 44.1/16) to match what vinil does to audiophile's senses.  It's just not something the ""free market"" will generally do.<p>Some records will never be digitized, and were mastered in an all-analog process to begin with.<p>But the whole time-space ""handling"" and ""smelling"" issue I don't get.  I used to have a turntable, it was always a hassle to load it up, etc.<p>You <i>own</i> the immersion.  Use it.  You want to listen to the whole album?  Listen to the whole album.<p>There is no one there to stop you.  Unless you own a cellphone, hate them dreaded time-leaches.",1241068146

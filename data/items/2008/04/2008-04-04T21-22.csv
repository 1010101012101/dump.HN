155286,comment,154776,155227,0,0,pg,,,"Sure, but since technological innovation tends to decrease prices, calling a price ""artificially low"" is the same thing as calling it a future price.<p>When GMail launched, it offered artificially large amounts of free storage, in the sense that they couldn't support many users at that size.  That's why they had to start with invites.  But they knew that disk would keep getting cheaper, so they just gave people a number that would make sense in the future.",1207346360

Some things I am thinking about:<p>- it is harder to open-source something than to deploy the site, because w/ open-sourcing, both the site and the code have to be in good shape, whereas with just deploying a site, it is not as big a deal if the code has some quirks. In other words, there are some deviations from Arc best practices that I want to take care of.<p>- I am thinking about whether there is an opportunity to have an open-source digg-killer based on Arc, and if so, what that would look like.<p>Anyway, if you want to work something out then shoot an email to: pageonetimes@idoh.com",1207346223

But assuming you can, the key to hiring and keeping them would be to give them freedom to work the way they want to, including letting them have their way if they feel strongly about design decisions.  Since we've assumed you've got good hackers, their design choices will tend to be right, so this is a safe move.",1207346050

Almost support ticket 2.0 (don't shoot me!). It costs money but it's pretty affordable -- the founder also frequents news.yc, I think.<p>Also, you will eventually outgrow using Gmail or Excel/Google Apps -- there's just a ton more features you're going to eventually need. Switch now, or switch later, eventually.<p>Things that hugely complex systems like RT completely miss: You really, really want to optimize on the bare-minimum path, IE what it takes to respond to a support request. Helpspot does this very well -- you can select pre-made answers that automatically file the request into a category and set any number of flags on the ticket (such as change who it's assigned to, etc) and that is really nice -- 1 click and you've answered a request.",1207345271

155258,comment,154871,155036,0,0,cadalac,,,"As a society, weather we consciously realize it or not, we use progress not as a way to work less but to think less. Example: the expiry dates on milk and stuff. Instead of letting people decide for themselves when the product goes bad we tell them the exact date that it goes bad. More quick examples? Here: Calculators, Fancy medical instruments, air guitars, spell checkers etc. All of these deaden our sense of observation and awareness and dull our minds.<p>So we have a choice: Do we make an effort to train our brains our do we let our technology do all the thinking for us? Well, why go through all the effort to train our brains when we don't have to?",1207344434

The martial arts teach patience and poise, which is almost exactly the opposite of a quick fix.<p>More concretely, Sig Kufferath (who basically carried the Danzan-Ryu torch to mainland USA) apparently beat the hell out of a couple guys who tried to mug him, then got them medical help and sent them flowers in the hospital.  (The story may be apocryphal, but I would not have put it past him)  Norvig's motives appear similar -- he is an acknowledged Jedi and has little to fear, in general, from helping others to raise their game.  Having crossed paths with both guys, I feel reasonably justified in my perception.",1207344118

But if the ""business guy"" is truly good, you won't even have to ask that question.<p>Quick anecdote from ""Founders at Work"": Wozniac did ALL of the technical things for Apple in the early days. People have implied that Jobs took advantage of him, but in the book Woz says something to the effect of ""Anything technical, I did. Anything business related, Steve did. And anything that either of us didn't know how to do, Steve just found a way to take care of it. He really wanted to have a company"".<p>If the ""business guy"" can fill that role, or at least work with that much passion, then it doesn't matter if he never contributes a bit of code.<p>Personally: I would <i>love</i> to have an MBA with 5+ years of corporate experience on our team right now.

You can have the most elegant code in the world that can scale magically to no end but turn off everyone who looks at it.<p>And that's ignoring the bigger picture - there's a large difference between what one amazing coder thinks would be awesome and what any market is actually interested in.  Don't get me wrong, it's very likely the same that can happen to a business superstar too, but if nothing else it's crucial to have people from different perspectives involved in a project.  You work to avoid tunnel vision that can completely lead you down the wrong path and waste those months of 50-60 hour weeks.<p>Also I would be willing to put forward that if you're not doing 50-60 hours worth of non-coding work for a startup, you're probably doing it wrong.",1207342871

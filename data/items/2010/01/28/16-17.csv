Often then, when I finally eat, it's because the lack of food / nutrients is starting to significantly hamper my thinking and focus.  But it takes (this well/overfed U.S. resident) some time to reach that point.<p>The problem is to keep this mode of life up for a sustained period of time.<p>I also tend to lose significant weight while on vacation.  This is usually because my vacations involve: 1) Intense, extended interaction with people (very occupying, if ""distracting"" is perhaps not the best word to use re social company) in non-food settings; 2) A lot of traveling and getting around from one novel place to another, again very occupying and without much of a food context.<p>I guess I could add that vacations for me involve very little TV.<p>Finally, as an aside, I've remained a fan of ""TV host"" Craig Ferguson's simple comment on the topic:  ""Eat less, move around more.""  I realize that it's not that simple for everybody, but for a fair number of people -- myself included -- it is.

A game like World of Warcraft is a themepark - you're given a lot of direction in terms of where you're supposed to go and what you're supposed to do.  EVE Online is a sandbox - you do whatever you want and you get fewer roadsigns that say ""go this way"" or ""beating this means you win"".<p>Current computers are sandboxes - you can do with them whatever you want, run arbitrary code, create your own workflow, and operate without rules.  The iPad is a themepark - it has specific programs that do specific things, and then it's got little roped off paths between them.  For many users (the proverbial Mom), a well-developed theme park is more attractive, because all they really wanted to do anyhow is ride the roller-coaster or the Ferris wheel.  People like the average Hacker News reader (or even the average reddit or digg reader) can't stand the roped off paths, but for Mom, those laid out sidewalks are a relief.",1264697209

We have new computing devices, particularly smartphones. We have new killer applications -- telephony and TV and books are all merging into computers, i.e. becoming a program you run on your computer.<p>It's even exciting on the programming language front, with new languages like Clojure, Erlang, Haskell, F#, etc having the possiblity of breaking out into the staid corporate computing world dominated by Java and C#.<p>Microsoft's dominance no longer seems assured.

1084180,comment,1083667,1083973,0,0,jerf,,,"The problem is that nobody care whether the ""climate is changing"". Change is the only constant. The question is whether it is bad and whether we can do something about it. Neither has been very well established in my mind. If in fact our CO2 contribution's effect is far smaller than the IPCC and environmentalists claim, then natural variation is the dominant factor and even completely giving up industrialization entirely next year may not have a very large effect. This means that it is a lot harder to affect the climate than we have been telling ourselves. And climate changes have been happening continuously for billions of years, so it's not at all obvious that they are <i>a priori</i> bad for anything other than human agriculture. (Which is itself bad, but something we can deal with, and broadly speaking is our problem rather than the ecosystem's problem.)<p>If environmentalists think they can turn on a dime after <i>thirty years</i> of ""anthropogenic global warming -> disaster"", they are in for a well-deserved beating in the court of general opinion. Falling back to ""The climate is changing"" is basically an admission that we have no clue, and more than that, where we thought human effects dominated it, it doesn't seem to. You can't just turn around and apply panic over AGW to panic over ""climate change""; it is neither rational nor human-irrational.<p>If you want to panic over something environmental, how about overfishing, plastic pollution in the pacific, fertilizer runoff, or something else that isn't ""debatable"" but actually, factually exists? In addition to the fact that it's a bad idea to try to ""salvage"" climate change as an issue, <i>it isn't even necessary</i>. There are <i>real</i> problems. Unless you personally are driven by using environmentalism as an excuse to destroy democracy and transfer wealth to the poor, if you are really driven by concern for the environment, <i>you don't need to ""win"" this issue</i>.

In my naïve enthusiasm I said sure.  I had opened my big mouth and the clock was ticking, with only 10 days to figure out how to juggle a live chainsaw without seriously injuring or killing myself.  The first four days I was so nervous that I wouldn’t even start the chainsaw.  Finally I pulled the cord and on my first attempt, I missed.  The chainsaw hit the ground and went crazy, buzzing at full speed.  Two policemen ran up and asked, “What the hell are you doing, kid?” I explained my dire situation and they thought it was cool.  They began cheering me on.  They wanted to see me do it!<p>On shoot day I show up for the commercial and get prepared.  I fire up the chainsaw and Tim Newman says, “Whoa, what are you doing?”  Long story short, after 10 days of practice, I find out they didn’t want the chainsaw running during the commercial (insurance won’t cover a stunt like that).  The plan was to just add the sound effect in post-production.  I felt a little stupid but it turned out to be the best mistake I ever made.  The seed had been planted and soon I was juggling three saws at the same time.

Please consider joining the group, spreading the word & adding some ideas.<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=277104755137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=277104755137</a><p>To prove that I do NOT want to hijack the thread here are all the ideas expressed in that group until now:<p>iShop: I'd like to have a nice shopping list app. iCal todo lists are just not as good. I think there's a whole collection of To-Do / Shopping / Productivity apps that can be built to fit this new form factor. The device encourages a little more interaction than the iPhone but still less than a full computer because of the lack of a decent keyboard.<p>iFingerpaint: .. for those spoiled kids who got the iToddler app! And for the grown ups a sketching app, and a photo editing app. Was actually preparing a submission for an iDoodle app or something similar to the existing iSteam app. I still like real paper for my brainstorming / doodling though. But the added screen real estate and multi-touch could give some nice interaction patterns, e.g. use the pinch move to crumble the piece of paper and toss it away.<p>iToddler / iAnnoyMyParents: Ever seen those platic toys with big colorful buttons that make funny sounds when your baby presses them? What about an app that has simple big icons, e.g. farm animals, a car, a plane, ... and when the child touches them with their hands it plays a sound / starts an animation. Guaranteed to drive parents crazy!<p>Offline Web Content Reader: Do you still print webpages for use in places where you don't have access to the internet? E.g. printing out a webpage or pdf for reading on the train / in the car? What about a simple web/pdf reader app that eats pdf or web archive files (created on your desktop with e.g. print-to-pdf or save-as-web-archive). You drop the files on the iPad app from your Desktop & the iPad can then display it offline in full gorgeous detail. I remember my Palm had such a sync feature now almost 10 years ago.<p>iClimb: What about an application where you post all of your climbed routes and share them with your friends? It would be nice to also post comments about the route, photo's, ... and a map to locate where the route is situated, so other climbers can get information about that specific route.<p>iShareMusic: The new SDK has easy file sharing built in. What about a combined Desktop/iPad app that scans your Desktop iTunes library & allows you to 'share' all of your music as a normal thumb drive instead of the annoying locked down iTunes connectivity. Want to copy music from a friends' iPad? Just plug in the iPad to your desktop computer, a thumb/usb drive mounts with all of the music on the device neatly organized in folders for easy copying. (DISCLAIMER: I'm not making any statements about the legality of this. Purely technical\ndiscussion.)<p>iPad for board games: I think one first massive category of apps will be turn-based board games. People have been playing board games for centuries (Think Chess, Go, etc ...). The form-factor is really inviting: it's basically a gaming board on which you can play multiple games. But with a twist: multi-finger & multi-people gestures will allow some really interesting physical gameplay.",1264694408

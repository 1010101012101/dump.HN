I wonder if he ever read pg's essays.<p>Nick is a great ""rabble rouser"".  I remember when he got all the pro-RISC professors at UC Berkeley mad at him by arguing RISC vs CISC was unimportant because modern CISC chips translated CISC to RISC internally.",1202777756

113712,comment,113655,113698,0,0,NSX2,,,"I can't begin to express how true this article is.  I was once a naive, yet optimistic 24 year old who spilled his guts to a reasonably prominent EIR at what was then a top-flight VC firm in the area.  I started suspecting something was wrong when I would get invited to their super-fancy digs (receptionist had 3 20-inch IBM flatscreen back when a 20-inch flatscreen actually almost cost $20k, the board room had 30 Aeron chairs, etc.), yet curiously enough never while anybody else was there, and would always be grilled for my 2 years of research findings, but after they ""sucked out all my ideas"" I couldn't seem to get any call-backs.<p>Tried another startup a year later and got sued by the EIR who claimed at first that our ideas were very similar ... then so similar that in fact he thought I ""stole"" what he saw as ""his"" idea.<p>I couldn't believe the nerve, and yet there they were, grown men twice my age who made million screwing me over without a second thought about all the crap they pay lip service to on their websites (ie, ""Our reputations mean everything to us"" and ""Our honesty is the basis of our credibility"") and all sorts of other mumbo jumo.<p>IN CONCLUSION: By all means keep at it, but be very, very careful - if they screw up they're still VC partners or EIRs, but you're done for at least that idea.",1202776325

Take one of those projects and just keep coding in your spare time, etc.<p>Try maybe Prosper? Or ask your friend engineers? The money at YC's levels can be found just about anywhere. The YC 'bump' with expertise, connections, etc, is likely of very high value, but zillions of people get by without it.<p>It sounds like your ideas may not align with YC-- maybe it's them and not you?<p>If you've proposed 5 times, you've got more gumption than a lot of entrepreneurs-- just keep moving.",1202775164

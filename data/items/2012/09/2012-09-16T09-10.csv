4528819,comment,4528211,4528211,5,0,stinos,,,"nice idea, but unfortunately I do not see this becoming 'big' for a couple of reasons. For instance, even though one can buy LEDs advertised as having a 'warm' colour, the light produced is still rather harsh compared to halogen for instance. Most people do not want an entire house, or even a single room, lighted purely by LEDs. Same goes for the colour: on paper it's nice to read that colour can set a certain mood and such, but is there really any practical use? Who wants to sit in a blue/green/red room anyway? Another factor is that it seems to be a small subset of an actual existing but practical system: current domotica systems can be controlled by your smartphone, by a pc, over the internet, you name it. And there are already dozens of them.",1347789526

Raising a family is slowly losing some  appeal due to overpopulation, possibilities of dramatic life extension, and the mere fact that it's something  that everyone can do (and does). Also, history books never mention someone as a good parent. In the end it's an investment decision: what are you willing to invest your most precious resource (your time) on?

One perfectly acceptable transition method, from a technical viewpoint (though probably not a political one), is the one that got us on IPv4 in the first place: a declaration that the Internet's core routers will stop routing the old protocol come January 1. Another transition method would be to write a protocol that doesn't need such tactics to get people to switch to.<p>If it's been ""being solved"" over the last ten years, neither you or I will see the end of IPv4 on the public Internet within our lifetimes. Or, if we do, it's because something bigger and better will come along, obsoleting every version of IP. The debate over whether to switch to IPv6 will sound as silly as a debate about Morse code in the 1960s.<p>The future will come up with their protocols. IPv6, or maybe something other than IPv6, needs to be a protocol we can start using now (and not just because it's cool, but because it's useful) and not feel like it's wasted if it becomes irrelevant in 2025.",1347786919

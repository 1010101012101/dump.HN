When I was working for a company I completed most of the tasks assigned to me before deadline but I wasn't happy doing that. I love to do the best possible work in least possible time humanly possible but as I have noticed most of the ""deadlines"" created by managers are unrealistic and stupid. Let me give you an example. Our project manager at that time(MBA from a top university) committed to client(electricity board) that the project we were working on will be completed in 3 days time and they can have a trial of it on 4th day. He didn't consult with programmers before making commitment. The reality was that it required another 20 days of work. Three of us had to work 56 hour continuously to complete it - an untested crappy code that just worked. I didn't liked it. Eventually after some months I left the job and never worked for anyone else again.<p>So this is how it works - Stupid clients will pressurize stupid managers for unrealistic deadlines and the stupid manager will accept it and will further pressurize programmers to do it. Good programmers will eventually leave the company/project and programmers like Gabriella will continue to meet the deadlines writing crappy code that just works and will eventually break down someday and it will be really hard for someone else to correct it because the code is a mess resulting in loss to client.

4503661,comment,4501159,4502475,3,0,bobwaycott,,,"Disclaimer: I have very strong disagreements with the President and several of his actions, including the Patriot Act issue (among others). I also agree with many of his social views.<p>Considering the role of the President properly, including the ways in which certain latitudes of movement (i.e., the ability to fulfill campaign promises or advance new agendas) are circumscribed by congressional action, I don't think asserting that he <i>could</i> have done X were it not for Y is really something that falls in the whether-you-believe-it-or-not category. Not everything in reality is there for you to believe or not believe.<p>The President does not have the power to just operate in total freedom, doing as s/he will with the office. The President can advance an agenda, attempting to build congressional support, but then has to pretty much wait to see what happens. Where that agenda <i>requires</i> Congress to take it up and act, it's rather disingenuous to blame any sitting President.<p>Moreover, there is a vast disconnect between the structure and operations of government and the People's <i>perception</i> of its structure and operations. When a sizable majority elects a presidential candidate based on the promises made in his/her platform, [I think] they actually <i>expect</i> to see those promises fulfilled. Unfortunately for the voters, the President doesn't really have the <i>actual</i> power to fulfill most (if not all) of them. This is especially frustrating when one sees a historical moment that could be capitalized upon, but is then reacted to with all manner of obstructing and filibustering that the ousted party can muster (such as that of the GOP focused on their goal of making President Obama a one-termer).<p>So, a new President enters the office, flying into the White House from the lofty heights of the People's surging will, and then Congress decimates the euphoria by thinking that they can go back to politicking and just ignore that the People voted not just for the candidate, but for the candidate's <i>platform</i>. In this way, the onus is really on the President's party to move forward with legislation that embodies the platform. To this end, the Democratic Party did a poor job.<p>Of course, this cuts both ways and is a difficult reality. Voters expect to see a President's platform promises fulfilled, and rightfully so. But as far as those who didn't vote for the platform are concerned, it's a tough road that carries with it all manner of Tocquevillian tyranny-of-the-majority concerns. Were Romney-Ryan to win, I sure as hell wouldn't want to see the whole of Congress hunkering down to draft legislation that mirrors the GOP platform, because I find most of it to be utterly atrocious and unconscionable (particularly where social issues are concerned). I want Congress to resist rolling us back to pre-1964/1972 America.<p>Obviously, the President can reverse EOs from prior Presidents. This, I think, would be an excellent thing for Presidents to <i>actually spend significant time doing</i>. Not just the occasional reversal that we typically see. They could be undoing all the damage wrought by their predecessor insofar as the people have voted with a clear enough mandate for his/her platform as it relates to being opposed to certain prior presidential actions. This is why Gitmo is such a sticking issue (to me, at least).<p>But where the platform consists of items that require legislation, the President is much more hamstrung to fulfill these promises--which then makes for great, but utterly useless, campaign fodder for his adversary in the next election cycle.<p>All that said, presidential <i>actions</i> that speak louder than words (or platforms), are another matter entirely. President Obama's actions have, on the whole, brought America back into considerably better standing with the world community than it was under Bush. I've seen quite a bit of press in Europe given to discussions about how much more preferable Mr. Obama is to Mr. Romney. There are plenty of presidential actions that have nothing to do with certain legislative actions--and yet the typical election cycle inevitably focuses on presidential actions that relate to <i>legislation</i> instead of fulfilling the job of being the <i>executive</i>.",1347335039

4503587,comment,4501117,4501117,1,0,they4kman,,,"I recall the day I didn't stop thinking how to break a problem down. I kept chipping away till each bit was dead simple. It was absolutely magnificent! It could be applied to everything! But within a month, I'd lost what I took for granted: knowing the dots would connect. (Thank you, wtvanhest; that quote struck a chord.)<p>I would chop up a big problem into beautifully simple tasks, but partway through executing them, I'd begin to worry about another task. Maybe it wasn't the best solution. Maybe it would be better this way, or if I changed dada-dada... I would take the simple solutions and mangle their limbs, building another big, complex, can't-fit-in-my-head problem, while still retaining the notion I was being effective.<p>I solved this problem (for me) by keeping a ""complex problem"" journal. I write roughly what the problem is and why it's a problem. I write how I'd know the problem is solved. Then I break it down into bits, writing a few sentences on how the bit connects to other bits. Sometimes it takes an hour, other times a day or a week. But once it's obvious, when my replies to any question are ""yes, the sky is blue"" and ""it's because fire is hot"", I need only reread the journal (often) to keep it fresh.<p>I accomplish this through delegation. If you leave your keys in a bowl near the door, you're prone to walk right past it, because you need to remember ""my keys are in the bowl"" every time. And you will remember it, but sometimes you won't. I leave my keys hanging on the door handle, so it's impossible to forget them -- they fall when I open the door. I don't rely on my faulty memory, I rely on my senses and the ability of the universe to trigger them.<p>It was a wonderful article, and I'm always thankful for whatever tests my assumptions and manner of doing. After all, the nicest thing anyone can do is knock you off your track.",1347333519

(Note to self: keep a few 40 minute talks handy in case the next discussion goes into a general area of interest :-)<p>My specific complaint will be that the talk occasionally digresses to what UX is, how a designer should be a good citizen, and how developers can be nice, etc. I am not familiar with the context of the talk, perhaps the general track had to have such discussions.<p>Nobody would argue that there would be no need to update the interaction as the product ages. However, that does not warrant the persistence of a designer in the middle of the development process. I am not referring to small changes to accommodate UI conveniences, about a design that did not fulfill its promise in the first place. A product design should not go out of date before it is released. A major revision is another story in itself, and that should be taken as a design update, and should be planned accordingly.<p>It is true that software is the most malleable product material ever, but the temptation to count on that malleability instead of focusing on good design only brings about frustration both on the side of developers and eventually on the side of designers, and most importantly on the side of customers.<p>Perhaps there is a bit of distrust between designers and the developers, as the developer has the final say in what is going to be done and what will be ignored, in addition to the need to update the design a little bit as the real usage data flows in. Or, perhaps the blanks in product requirements is a lot bigger in startups vs enterprise in a way that would effectively get the product change drastically every 3 months. I have only seen iterative design work well in indie games and small-time mobile apps, but those really do not count, as they would only be considered as prototypes in an enterprise environment, and you'd probably go about doing that much prototype while designing your framework.",1347332816

opinion), I will never down-vote them. My reason is simple; they might
be entirely sincere and believe they're contributing even though they're
unknowingly wrong and unfortunately spreading misinformation. If I have
better information, I post it, politely, and with references if at all
possible. If it's a matter of differing opinions (not facts), then it's
best to just quietly let it slide. I didn't come here for an argument,
or lessons in getting hit over the head (sorry for the Monte Python
reference).<p>Additionally, I don't need to agree with someone to appreciate the time
they took to share and post their views. Even if I never agree with
them, I benefit from knowing how the other side(s) sees things.<p>If someone is being rude or intentionally insulting, that's good for at
least a down-vote, and possibly a flag if it's egregious.<p>Both flagging too much, and down-voting too much <i>does</i> have effects on
your account. The precise mechanics including the value of ""too much""
have never been made public. I can't prove this in code that's actually
running on HN (no public), but there's an ancient post by pg that
mentions it. I could probably dig it up from my notes if anyone needs
further confirmation... But, who's to say pg hasn't changed things in
the years between that old post and now?<p>It makes sense that there's a price to pay for abusive flagging and
down-voting. If you spend a lot of time on the 'new' page (/newest
queue) and flag the spam as it happens, you could very well trip the
abusive flagging threshold. On the other hand, if you do trip the
threshold, and pg/mods see that you're actually trying to help out with
the spam, they'll be thankful rather than upset.<p>Some down-votes are entirely unintentional. The voting UI/UX has issues
in mobile environments where small screens and large fingers result in
miscast votes. It wasn't so long ago that I saw Joey Flores (YC funded -
earbits.com) apologize to pg for accidentally down-voting him, so it
indeed happens to the very best of HN users.<p>As you might expect, the result of miscast votes is some voting patterns
you see are actually somewhat random. Adding to the randomness are
language barriers causing misinterpretations. Also adding to the
randomness are quickly written and poorly communicated comments. Even
when you mean well, others might not understand what you wrote.<p>Off the top of my head, I think it was you (001sky) who recently replied
to one of my posts, and I didn't really understand your comment... Yep,
it was you:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4493615"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4493615</a><p>Maybe it's written perfectly and I'm the sole cause of my failure to
understand? ;-) But anyhow, the point is, miscommunication happens
constantly and it is one of the causes of down-votes.<p>My ability to type comes and goes due to my health, so I don't post or
contribute very much. When I do post, I rarely get down-voted. I might
get one down-vote in fifty posts or so. I do keep a very close eye on
the score of my posts, and if I notice a down-vote, I'll dig in my
comments to see where it occurred. Since I know about the randomness
problems in voting patterns, I never take a down-vote personally. For
all I know, it could have been an intended up-vote that went wrong, or
someone in the habit of down-voting for mere disagreement of opinions.<p>Even if someone down-votes me out of mere disagreement, it's still
useful feedback.<p>The best practice for debates on matters of contention is simple; be
certain to give the other person both polite respect and the benefit of
the doubt on their intentions. Some people will <i>still</i> react in rude
and insulting ways if you politely pose a tough question, or dare to
offer an opposing view to their imaginary authority.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4489017"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4489017</a><p>It's just one of the risks to open forums. Some people think being rude

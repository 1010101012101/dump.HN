Copy-on-write will make it look like each apache child is using 40MB, when really it's only 10MB private RSS.

In the top 20th percentile of ""secure"" enterprise dev shops, with teams working on J2EE applications for claims processing and document retention, each dev cycle starts with a ""threat model"".<p>Threat modeling is part of the ""SDL"" (or ""SDLC""), which is a powerful voodoo magic word that here means ""secure software development"". Threat modeling is both notoriously fuzzy --- nobody really knows exactly what it means --- and notoriously boring. The goal of the process is to help ensure that you're designing securely, developing securely, and dtesting securely (I forget what the 3rd of the 3 D's is).<p>Cory's talking about a methodology for getting teams to do threat modeling that either haven't totally bought into formal SDL development or skip the threat modeling step.<p>I'm not totally sure how this applies to startups and indies  [1], but I am sold on the concept of ""Seven Deadly Features"", which is to say that any team should be able to start a project with a list of the 7 functional areas that are most likely to screw them over from a security perspective. A very typical list for web apps would be:<p>* File upload/download (it's a boundary crossing and often requires you to synchronize two different access control systems)<p>* Email (most apps have some kind of effectively anonymous account and some path for that account to trigger emails with some content controlled by attackers)<p>* Advanced Query Interfaces (because they're hard to implement using pure parameterized queries)<p>* Templating and look/feel customization (because you need to expose some, but not all, of HTMLs metachars to end users)<p>* User signup and password reset<p>(That's 5; the list on my desk is 7, but the last two --- SOAP/web services and thick clients --- are not likely to be problems for startups).<p>Can't evangelize enough for this idea, which is a really simple one. People who do web security memorize things like the OWASP Top 10, which lists ""Cross Site Scripting"" and ""Cross Site Request Forgery"" and ""SQL Injection"", but like Cory says, nobody wakes up in the morning thinking ""I'll write an SQL Injection today!"". Meanwhile, if you know what the scary features are, you can:<p>* Schedule them for extra-formal team review<p>* Double up the QA time on them<p>* Not assign them to junior team members to implement<p>[1] We wrote about this a few weeks ago:<p><a href=""http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2009/9/24/indie-software-security-a-12-step-program.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2009/9/24/indie-software...</a>",1256059510

892757,comment,892581,892581,0,0,blahedo,,,"Keep in mind that to someone totally untrained in science, ""a scientist says"" is not that different from ""a priest says"" in terms of asking them to take something on faith.  As level of scientific training increases, this changes somewhat, as we begin to understand that ""a scientist says"" carries a certain implicit claim as to the experimentation that went into the discovery; but even then, it's important to remember that much of what you and I _know_ about science we know because some authority figure told us.  We may have chosen our authority figure wisely, but that's still what it is: do you believe light travels through a vacuum, or through a mysterious lumeniferous aether?  Why?  Is it because you did an experiment?  Can you even explain what the experiment is?<p>As for me, I learned it in class and read it in a book.  A lot of the ""convince people of evolution"" argumentation is focussing on entirely the wrong level of instruction, because it's asking people who learned one thing in class and read it in a book to instead believe a different thing that someone else learned in class and read in a book.  Local evidence is no help either, because it's going to be anecdotal, and a lot of nonscientific arguments (including religious ones) can marshal evidence too.  The problem is not convincing creationists to believe in evolution; it's not even convincing believers in one authority to believe in a different authority (which, while solving one immediate problem, just defers and sets up a different one).  The problem is in convincing people of the scientific framework in the first place.<p>So no, DNA wouldn't do it.",1256058365

It strikes me as absurd that alternate fuel proposals will actually make our roads considerably more dangerous.<p>Instead of turning a vehicle crash into a wreckage with a potential for a fire, we'll be turning a crash into a wreckage with the potential for a massive explosion. Any passenger caught in a vehicle with a hydrogen fuel tank that BLEVE's is guaranteed to be dead, and so is anyone within yards of it.

In this case there is a strong mathematical model, with scientific evidence, that not vaccinating children can harm other children. Because of this I am questioning your analogy, since in the case of the draft there is not a non-opinion social component.<p>Instead I analogize with drunk driving -- significantly fewere drunk drivers equates to significantly fewer 3rd party injuries and deaths as a result of drunk drivers. Similarly in the vaccination case, there are 3rd parties who stand to suffer from the actions of those who do not receive vaccines.<p>Edit: I forgot to put my second point, which is:<p>I agree with your analogy in that those who stand to benefit should be closely scrutinized when advocating a position.",1256058002

You have to be careful to remove bias.<p>For example, if I set up a scientific study that compares the intelligence of vegetarians to meat-eaters I may find vegetarians scoring higher on intelligence than meat-eaters but that wouldn't necessarily prove the points that I speculated about above.<p>That's because meat is subsidized, so people in poverty would have a harder time being vegetarian, and I would think that poverty is correlated with education level which would be correlated with intelligence.

1155320,comment,1153622,1154902,0,0,gwern,,,"> First of all, you have modified the function that I posted (you changed the type declaration from a list to an array).<p>How would I demonstrate SBCL's ability to detect type errors except by making a type error? Your example showed nothing; 'type' could be a null-op for all it does.<p>And checks about primitive types are all well and good, but how far does it go? Not being much of a lisper, it's hard for me to give whole classes of example where SBCL's warnings are non-existent, incorrect, or buried under a flurry of others. If I declare a custom CLOS object with multiple fields/methods/whatever and call a field/method which doesn't exist, is SBCL still smart enough to warn me? I dunno.",1267282234

At a minimum, I would think that it must include making people's lives better, directly or indirectly. By that metric, solving a puzzle - e.g. sudoko - is fake, as the puzzle could be solved much more efficiently e.g. by a computer program, and the human effort put into solving it could be much more productive - and ""real"" - elsewhere.",1267282220

Microsoft requires game publishers to have a certain minimum number of those popup achievements in the game before they approve it for production. Cynically, the publisher (a medium-sized Japanese company) created achievements for it like ""Cleared level 1"" ""Shot an enemy"" ""Cleared level 2"" ""Died"" ""Defeated a boss"" ""Touched a power-up"" ""Score was a multiple of 200"" ""Watched the credits"" stuff like that.

Moreover, privacy in general is a relatively new idea, and the lack of political upheaval over the centuries means there haven't been any major events to cause a general overhaul where such privacy laws might have been created.<p>Part of it is probably that the scaremongering from mid-market and tabloid print media, as well as the ruling party actually works, and people have been led to believe that the authoritarian measures are for their benefit. There seem to be fairly widespread xenophobic attitudes, and a fear of the ""out of control"" youth.<p>The education that kids receive at school seems to be pretty poor [1], which gives people little historical and political perspective and therefore no strong feelings towards personal freedom.<p>The plurality election system of the House of Commons also causes a relatively weak opposition.

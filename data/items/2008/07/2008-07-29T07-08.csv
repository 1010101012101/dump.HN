With Knol, everybody creates their own, which is just like... the Internet. As in, I can put up a homepage on my server about anything I like. So basically Google wants to have ""the Internet"" on their servers, with all the pages displaying their ads.<p>Also, in terms of quantity and quality, Knol (unlike Wikipedia) is competing with <i>all</i> the rest of the Internet. With Wikipedia, the small fraction of ppl willing to work on it <i>together</i> create pages (that are worthwhile). With Knol, everyone will create their own page, hence there's no difference between them and the rest of the independent Internet.<p>I think Knol will die off within a year.",1217318337

Another word for ""quick learners"".<p>2. Sacrificing happiness? Not if it feels good to work on something you believe in.<p>3. Sacrificing creativity? Since when is it not creative to create a new business?<p>4. ""18 hour days for two straight months"" -- from the point of view of ""hard work,"" big deal. Good stress makes you stronger. You're alive all 18 hours anyway -- if you believe in what you are doing, and you take care of yourself along the way, then all that effort can actually <i>add</i> to your energy levels.<p>5. But the key line is ""if you take care of yourself."" The effects of sleep deprivation (and eating shit for food) are real.

eg: Newton and Einstein will be remembered for the centuries to come though other brilliant physicists will not. Humanity will respect Wright brothers for many ages to come, though the case may not be same for the person who invented jet engine.<p>May be their original work is not in much use these days but they opened a new domains for future generations to work on and that created the shift.",1217316932

It was a large project with a lot of people (and a lot of science). Yes, a lot of them worked hard. But please, measure effort on a human scale. It doesn't matter whether you're starting a company or developing a new technology for space travel -- if you're pouring your whole life into it, the same psychological conditions can apply.",1217316798

260208,comment,260017,260153,0,0,olefoo,,,"> ""They receive unconditional love, acceptance, and attention from a charismatic..."" You should have been at my team's first meeting; it was like this, but the opposite. Informal founder feedback sessions have been similar. The carebear environment the author described wouldn't work anyway - the VCs would destroy us.<p>Actually most accounts of actual cult experiences describe a never-ending cycle of harsh criticism intended to break down the followers sense of self, followed by love from the charismatic leader.<p>So, to an extent you're validating what Daniel is saying.<p>Any elite group is going to have some cultlike qualities. The real hard part comes when you are attempting to determine if you are benefiting from the emotional programming you are receiving, and if not when you should leave.<p>I really doubt that YCombinator is a cult, if it were you'd see the leadership ordering founders to give up their own projects and work on projects the leadership favours and ratcheting up the share of equity demanded, and generally see people getting taken advantage of. And if it were seriously going wrong you'd see ostracism and megalomania.",1217315472

The LOTR movies were in top-10 once too.<p>I suppose IMDB might try to account for the initial voting wave being raving fans and dampen the initial votes, but why would they? Personally I've reloaded the ""Dark Knight"" IMDB page half a dozen times to see if it was still at #1.<p>The most popular topic on the IMDB message boards is ""This does not deserve to be in top 250"" or ""Why is this not in Top 250 why some-other-movie is not?"". People like to keep an eye on rankings and to comment on them.<p>The main practical use for the ratings IMHO is to get a list of movies within each genre sorted by the rating, to see if you missed something people thought was great.",1217315101

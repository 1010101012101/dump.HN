Rust as-is with it&#x27;s LLVM backend and lack of runtime has a clear path forward for anything LLVM can target (which is a lot now, and will be more in the future). This should get us into many platforms.<p>The compile-to-C case is the most straightforward of the three you mention, but also the one I&#x27;m most skeptical of. I do understand that there are some venerable old and/or small platforms where C is the only option. I don&#x27;t know any specific examples of what people want to do by transpiling to C though. The only thing I know with any certainty is &#x27;8-bit microcontrollers&#x27;, and this is one case that Rust is likely to be a tough fit for (largely because it wants pointer-sized things to be &#x27;big enough&#x27;, as well as other reasons I&#x27;ve forgotten).<p>Still, if it&#x27;s necessary, it can be done with great effort (see the perennially broken LLVM C backend), but it&#x27;s very low priority as of now.<p>I&#x27;m not sure yet the role of a JVM/.NET backend for Rust (besides the coolness factor) and I don&#x27;t think people have put a great deal of thought into it. What we <i>will</i> have though is easy ways to bridge between the managed runtimes and Rust for accelerating your managed code or binding to system APIs. This will be necessary for creating decent Android/Windows environments.<p>(On the .NET topic a MSIL backend would also get us non-asm.js JS via [JSIL](<a href=""http://www.jsil.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsil.org/</a>) which would give Rust access to the DOM.

Whilst you can do this in Spotify, I understand you have to manually click a button to enable offline playback.<p>Furthermore, Apple Music will shows me which tracks are cached for offline playback, since those which are not are greyed out and un-clickable, whereas I don&#x27;t recall seeing anything like it in Spotify. This feature is particularly useful on the tube (London Underground for people in the USA/Europe/Rest of World) where you have intermittent WiFi at stations (in fact, by the time your phone has connected to the access point on the platform the train is already pulling out of the station - so you&#x27;ve got to be fast!).<p>However, I feel like Apple could have done better with the Apple Music experience on iPhone and iPad.

It means people don&#x27;t have to lay out their editor and shell to match your code. Your editor can be set to 80 col, your shell can too, and then you can leave it and it should work across languages, code-bases, and libraries. An extra line break here or there is preferable to having to drag windows around to read your code. At 80 cols I can get three editor windows on screen, allowing me great views of a lot of relevant code for the bit I&#x27;m writing, or a shell in place of one editor that I can be running tests on. Once 82 cols is okay, why not 84, or 90, or 100? What about when the middle column needs 84 cols, and I have to drag everything around. That&#x27;s rude and productivity sapping.<p>I know some people program with one editor maximised and can have 200 character lines if they like, but a specific width as a convention is helpful.

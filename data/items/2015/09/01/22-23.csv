But since they obviously don&#x27;t <i>really</i> subscribe to the idea of Open Web (as evident by their enthusiastic support for DRM in HTML, which is about as anti-Open Web as it gets), I guess I just wish they could be more honest about it. After all, what good is it that someone uses an &quot;Open Media&quot; format when it&#x27;s put behind a completely closed black box barrier of DRM that you aren&#x27;t even allowed to legally poke at thanks to anti-circumvention laws?<p>I do think this particular development is very much a good thing for the Open Web, and I certainly don&#x27;t doubt Mozilla commitment to that.

Correctness problems:<p>* Make cannot correctly specify file system state dependencies (like inexistence of files, such as include files in include paths prior to the found location).<p>* Make doesn&#x27;t protect against accidental edits of source code while it is being built, poisoning the result files. When you try to run &quot;make&quot; again, it will say nothing is to be done, but the result file [with its newer mtime] can actually be based the pre-save source file.<p>* Make uses < and > for mtime checks (not just ==) and that is incorrect on some operating systems (e.g: Windows).<p>* Make offers no practical way to track or enforce system-level dependency changes.<p>* Easily miss stderr printouts from compilers/etc, if you missed them at the first time around (losing mainly gcc/clang warnings)<p>The &quot;solution&quot; is almost always to &quot;make clean&quot; whenever voodoo bugs are encountered, anything system-level is changed, etc. This is terrible if you expect correctness from your tools.<p>Flexibility-wise, make is also awful, due to one <i>huge</i> problem:<p>Make requires the dependency graph to be fully specified, including all transitive dependencies. This makes code generation a near impossibility -- since you often need to scan the generated code to figure out its dependencies.<p>IOW: Make is a &quot;two-phase&quot; build system, where we really want an &quot;N-phase&quot; build system that interleaves building with dependency scanning/discovery.<p>Also, this is taken for granted, but it is major: Make requires error-prone specification of all file dependencies.  This is impractical <i>to do correctly</i> in large, complex projects. Every script being run may have tons of transitive dependencies that are very hard to specify. Any mistake will usually go unnoticed, until you hit a &quot;voodoo bug&quot; and just &quot;make clean&quot;.<p>Additionally, make doesn&#x27;t support any form of advanced caching of previous build results.<p>---<p>All these problems, and more, made me decide to create my own build system for our complex C project: buildsome[1].<p>It uses file system hooking to provide both correctness (no more missed input dependencies!) and simplicity (no need to specify each and every transitive dependency, they can be automatically discovered).<p>It checks input files for changes after the build commands (to avoid output file poisoning).

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (19M kids), and 42,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 80 (33 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for senior software engineers, product managers, and analytics superstars.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs</a>, or check out our recent press here:\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-third-of-schools-are-using-this-app-youve-never-heard-of"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-thir...</a>",1441147250

10156221,comment,10154367,10155903,0,0,kazinator,,,"I think it&#x27;s clearer if you don&#x27;t bring in the lemma. Calling the continuation is the same as returning a value: both are just a jump that restores the stack pointer and communicates a value. (The continuation just keeps the stack below the stack pointer instead of discarding it.) (Could it be that it&#x27;s <i>because</i> continuations have certain properties that they fall under the lemma?)<p>The commutative diagrams, rather, remind me of diagrams that I remember from chemistry. We can go from this molecule to that one via this path or that one, and the energy deltas are the same.<p>Speaking of continuations, I&#x27;m currently looking at porting the trick used by some OCaml people of doing delimited continuations on the C stack, into my own language.  It&#x27;s pretty neat: just copy the C stack into a closure-like object, and then when you need to invoke the continuation, swap that segment back onto the regular linear stack (into a stable space prepared using alloca). Rebuild some exception handling chains through this new pieces of stack, and then invoke the thing using an exception (ultimately a longjmp). When it is done running, you can blow it away. All permanent effects are in external environments that are on the heap. The next time you call into it, you just copy it in the same way.<p>I&#x27;m unclear on how you can do a longjmp to something that has been copied elsewhere on the stack relative to its original location. I mean, the jmp_buf probably has an absolute stack pointer in it which it restores. I have to look at their code again; the obvious hack is to scan the jmp_buf for values that look like pointers into the stack area and adjust those values.<p>I implemented a stack copying hack once to get a 64 bit Linux kernel on MIPS to call into 32 bit firmware, passing ordinary local variables (whose addresses are 64 bit values on a 64 bit stack) to the firmware functions. I copied the kernel thread&#x27;s stack into a buffer 32 bit addressable space. Then I adjusted all internal pointers within that stack to point to the correct places in the new location. The threads&#x27;s pointer was then thunked into that space around the call to the firmware. The firmware API wrapper was then seeing data addresses whose lowest 32 bits could be passed down to the firmware routines via 32 bit registers and still point to the correct data. Of course, a reverse copy from the faked stack was then done to retrieve any results which the firmware routine wrote into local buffers. This worked well enough that I was able to expose boot firmware environment variables through a /proc interface (even making it writable!) Based on such past experience, I&#x27;m confident I can do this delimited continuation hack.",1441146349

The Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation policies between the 1930s and 1950s gave &quot;absurd amounts&quot; of money primarily to white home owners. So-called &quot;Sundown towns&quot; prohibited non-white people from living there. Levittown, the first and most famous mass-produced suburb in the US, did not accept applications from black people.<p>The white population has therefore been able to take advantage of the long-term real estate boom in the US, with the generous financial support from the government. The black population has not. It takes more than a generation or two for these differences to go away.<p>&quot;Why I never seen such problems with east asian immigrants?&quot;<p>Perhaps because you don&#x27;t know much about the topic? The Hmong people, who supported the US in Vietnam and fled to the US as refugees when the US pulled out, have had problem integrating. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_American#Hmong_in_the_U.S"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_American#Hmong_in_the_U....</a>. .<p>You also have to remember that the US was anti-Asian immigration for a long time. We feared the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;. We had some pretty nasty and strict laws in place to keep most of them out. Quoting from the Wikipedia page on the topic, which quotes Horace Greeley:<p>> The Chinese are uncivilized, unclean, and filthy beyond all conception without any of the higher domestic or social relations; lustful and sensual in their dispositions; every female is a prostitute of the basest order<p>In 1923, the US Supreme Court in United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind found that an Indian Sikh man, despite being Caucasian, was not the right kind of &#x27;white&#x27;. As the Naturalization Act of 1906 allowed only &quot;free white persons&quot; and &quot;aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent&quot; to be naturalized citizens, his naturalization was revoked.<p>With the Immigration Act of 1917 we banned immigration from much of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It wasn&#x27;t until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that we let Japanese, Koreans, and other Asians become naturalized in the US.<p>With the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the old quota system was replaced with a &quot;preference system that focused on immigrants&#x27; skills and family relationships with citizens or U.S. residents.&quot;<p>So you&#x27;re only talking about relatively recent immigration from East Asia to the US, and with a preference for those who have skills the US wants.<p>That&#x27;s a very different background than the generations of blacks who were taken or born into slavery, followed by another century of racist social and government policies.

This enables unprecedented data analytics: for example, we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors finish grading in half the time.<p>Our product has been used to grade over 3.5 million pages of work belonging to over 30,000 students. We’ve raised a seed round, and are making our first full-time engineering hire to join the founding team of two PhDs and professor from Berkeley CS. Over the next few months, we’re looking to expand our user base and roll out advanced features including autograding, analytics, and more. We offer market-rate salary with generous equity.<p>We’re currently looking for a full-stack engineer. We&#x27;ve got a Rails backend with some React on the frontend.<p>If you’re interested, please email jobs@gradescope.com",1441144939

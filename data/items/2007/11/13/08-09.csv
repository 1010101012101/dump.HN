(S-Corps are easier to deal with come tax time, but have significant limitations concerning investors.)<p>3) Nolo (<a href=""http://www.nolo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nolo.com/</a>) has been suggested<p>4) Delaware is usually advised.<p>5) I always use my parents' address.  They haven't moved in 20 years.  I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure your real operating address doesn't have to be the same as what your incorporation papers say.<p>6) I have yet to find a good resource for this.<p>7) Set a valuation of the company, and divide it by how many shares are outstanding.  That is the share price.  You can buy shares at that price.  After that, issue paper stock certificates and record it in your general ledger (most general ledger software (IE QuickBooks) has a whole section for ""Owner's Equity"").  Going forward, don't forget to issue stock for ""sweat equity"" on a vesting schedule.  (I always get confused about the differences in shares declared vs outstanding vs issued.  But I think this is right)<p>8) I always open a business checking account and a business credit account with American Express.  Be careful with credit (depending on how careful you are and what contract you sign, you may be personally liable for the debt), but it is usually cheaper than equity.",1194941379

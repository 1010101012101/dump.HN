4893609,comment,4892355,4892355,2,0,VexXtreme,,,"I personally avoid reporting errors with null return values, though that approach might actually be useful in some situations. I've seen cases where less-than-skilled developers had an irrational fear of exceptions and just treated them like undesirable error states instead of an error reporting and handling mechanism. It resulted in systems where every layer of the call stack was polluted with blocks such as:<p>if (result != null)\n{\n}\nelse ...<p>This usually results in the real cause of an error being completely and utterly lost somewhere in the call stack, as using this kind of binary approach to error reporting is inadequate to communicate what really happened.<p>Question:<p>How do you handle data concurrency issues in big multi-user systems? For instance, if your lowest level service (usually data access layer) throws a data concurrency exception due to some other user modifying the data that the current user is trying to modify, how do you communicate to your user that the data has changed and that they are supposed to refresh the web page, if you are masking the real cause of the problem by just returning null values from the lowest level of the call stack?<p>I personally handle cases like this by allowing the appropriate exception to propagate to the highest level so that I can make a judgment call whether it's the kind of error that needs to be reported to the user, silently logged or something else. On lower levels I still might have try-catch blocks for logging purposes and in certain situations I might rethrow exceptions if the error needs to be reported to a higher level.",1355021956

I wish people would explain exactly what they want. What is the goal here? I also don't work well when others assume I know everything they know. Breaking down the preferred end result and then explaining why they haven't arrived there is most helpful. Follow that up with specifically what <i>I</i> can do to help them reach their goal and things usually end up successful.<p>4. I don't believe in MB. I prefer business-y things, but have pigeon-holed myself in the tech world. Ooops.<p>5. I am constantly on phone/IM with my team. I actually quite enjoy phone calls and feel this is likely an anomaly. Most people don't like it, but I see it as a way to communicate more effectively and avoid email.<p>6. Split! I actually love working from our offices because I am an 80% remote employee. Facetime, IRL with my co-workers is invaluable. I feel they're more forthcoming and much more willing to share ideas when it's just stopping by my desk. Phone calls, IMs and emails are purpose-driven, which removes a lot of off-the-cuff creativity and brainstorming.

Made me smile when he kept putting him back in the initial position only to see him turn in a different way.<p>Given the intelligence of African Gray Parrots (which is estimated to be around a 4 or 5 year old child), there's a good chance the bird was doing it intentionally when it kept having to repeat the task over and over.<p>Birds like this are supposed to also get extremely attached to their owner (as much as any owner and their dog), especially when they don't have a mate.

It is quite amazing and fully understanding it carries a sense of deep beauty and appreciation for the complexities and interdependencies by which our body sustains life.<p>re your question:\nYou have 2 overarching (and this is simplifying slightly) thermodynamic gradients operating in the body:\n<i>Catabolism</i> and <i>Anabolism</i>.<p>Catabolic processes break down polymers (of which everything is composed). For example: in the Carbohydrate family, we have Starches or Glycogen; a polymer of Glucose monomers.\nIn the Fats family, Triacylglycerides (TAGs) and Fatty acids are 3 and 2 polymer complexes of the standard 'fat' chain. Proteins are polymers of the 20 biological amino acid monomers, which are combined in an infinite variety of combinations and lengths to create the different structures of our body.<p>We break Fats and Carbs down to their monomers to ingest them into the body (enzymes etc in the Gut). Malabsorption here will result in excess nutrients in our GIT which bacteria can then feast on, causing medical symptoms of maldigestion. Bacteria also operate in a complex synergy with our GIT to keep everything 'regular' however that's far beyond the scope of this discussion, and pushing the limits of the understanding of science even.<p>Further catabolic processes go on to take fats and carbs down to the burning stage in the mitochondria, which results in the production of ATP, the body's fuel source (you can think of carbs and fats as the crude unrefined elements and then ATP is the refined, useful fuel which every source in the cell which requires energy can utilise)<p>Production of ATP is in itself a Anabolic process by definition, as it is a more energetic molecule than it's precursors. Note that the production of ATP is coupled to a catabolic process, the burning of carbon in the Krebs Cycle inside the mitochondria.<p>ATP is the energy source which is then utilised by different proteins in the cell to provide the energy to catalyse the formation of monomers into polymers - this is the process that creates structural proteins, the elongation and duplication of DNA, elements of the Phospholipid Bilayer (the cell membrane - which has 2 fatty acids/fats as the tail) and all the other cellular components.<p>Note that Anabolism is an energetically expensive process, as you are building molecules which have more energy than the precursors, and so you require a fuel source for this.\nthis is really what we mean when biologists say that the whole system is driven by thermodynamics.<p>---<p>TL;DR - We break everything down into it's monomer subunits to get it into our bloodstream. Special transports exist for Amino Acids, Vitamins, Nucleotides, Simple Carbs, Fats etc. Once inside, our protein cellular machinery stores some energy (in Glycogen or Fat), Burns some energy (Energy consumption is coupled to energy expenditure at the mitochondrial level - rate of production of ATP is limited by rate of consumption; O2 is the limiting factor when consumption is high), and uses amino acids and fats, and carbons from Carbohydrates as different structural and functional components in our cell.<p>So yes, you are right, we don't burn everything to H2O and CO2. But essentially everything that produces the useful energy in our body does go through this process.<p>I hope this sort-of answers your question even though I got a bit side-tracked",1355019790

I'd love to see something that improves on what we've learned from Game Maker to help train the next generation.",1355019642

""Statistically significant"" is a relative term and when testing an entire population is infeasible (as it often is), we instead sample some fraction that we believe is ""statistically significant"" on the assumption that it will accurately reflect the whole.<p>The point of this article is that a sample only accurately reflects the whole in <i>some</i> ways.  Variability in particular scales with the square root of the sample size.  And since misconceptions about variability have been at the heart of many controversies (male vs. female intelligence, school size, cancer risk, etc.), De Moivre's equation is important; even dangerous in the sense that ignorance of it has led to billions of dollars wasted.",1355019501

They've done the same recently in Lybia and are doing it in Syria. The West arms the Syrian rebels but the U.S. is now calling the leading Syrian opposition group, al-Nusra Front, a foreign terrorist organization.

Proteins can also carry metals - so bits of iron or copper or other things we need to make some proteins function correctly are 'carried' into the intestinal system this way.\nThe only other thing we really need is lots and lots of Phosphate, which we take in largely through consumption of DNA in things we eat<p>If proteins are to be burnt in mitochondria the nitrogens are converted to urea and excreted.<p>Vitamins are just arrangements of carbon atoms with the occasional nitrogen and oxygen and hydrogen around. Some have a single copper or zinc atom there too.<p>We really don't use any more than this, our body literally does just run on carbon. To complete your statement, although there is more in food than just carbon, there really isn't much that we are interested in (biochemically speaking) than the carbon, although the body has uses for some of the myriad forms that are created in other plants and animals that we can't synthesise ourselves.",1355018591

7555975,comment,7554904,7555232,5,0,jalfresi,,,"We had this exact issue too. The answer was to modify the workflow. Select the transition that currently isnt resolving (in our case it was transitioning from &quot;In Review&quot; to &quot;Done&quot;) and adding a new &quot;Post Function&quot; which updates the issue field &quot;Resolution&quot; to &quot;Resolved&quot;. After that all the little graphs etc were correct.<p>You can also bulk modify issues that are unresolved by transitioning them to &quot;In Review&quot; and bulk updating them again back to &quot;Done&quot; which then correctly set the resolution field. Unfortunately this technique means that all your issues are now resolved on the same day so your graphs etc show a big spike on one day.<p>For some reason this bug occurs after a few days with any of the default workflows in Jira, but it&#x27;s not too big a deal if you spot it early and fix the workflow to resolve issues correctly.<p>As for the Jira/Godzilla thing, I always thought it was a reference to Mozillas Bugzilla, which I thought was kinda cool :)<p>Hope that helps!",1396990755

I think you might be confusing this with &quot;taskheel&quot;, which are the &quot;mini-vowels&quot;. That is something else though. Now, if you mean if the vowels are <i>not</i> part of the root of the word, then you&#x27;re also wrong. Some roots do have vowels. The root you are suggesting: Q-R-N (ق ر ن) (pronounced Qa-Ra-Na, with mini-vowels, perhaps that was the source of your confusion) is a root for a different group of words than Q-R-&#x27; (ق ر ء) (pronounced Qa-Ra-&#x27;a with a glottal stop). From the former, you can derive qiran (wedding or matrimony), aqran (peers), muqaranah (comparison) and so on. From Q-R-&#x27; you can derive reading or recitation (qira&#x27;ah), and Qur&#x27;aan. Note the glottal stop in both words, this is part of the root. Again, this shows your ignorance in the language.<p>Take another example: from the root H-M-D (pronounced Ha-Ma-Da) (ح م د) one can derive Hamdan (حمدان) which rhymes with Qur&#x27;aan. Note how in both words, the last letter &quot;n&quot; is not part of the roots for either word. I&#x27;m happy to give you many more examples that show this is the case.<p>> Here&#x27;s essentially why I believe Luxenberg...<p>Interesting account, but still not sufficient. I would be interested though in hearing more about it (e.g. if you wrote a report or short document with references and citations). All that you mentioned is that you took some early Quranic manuscripts and you had someone read them. Now I don&#x27;t know who that Islamic scholar is, a single data point does not mean anything, and you should know better. It is incorrect that in early Islamic studies you will never see an early manuscript of the Qur&#x27;aan. Let me tell you something, we have known this since we were kids (exposed to it in school): that early Arabic script did not have dotted letters -- this is the Kufic script to which you are referring. It is not some obscure piece of information that only a handful of people know. I presume you are referring to scripts such as [0], am I correct? In any case, I would be interested to take a look at the Quranic scripts you mentioned.<p>Unless you formally show me at least a handful of Ayat (verses) of the Quran transliterated to Aramaic, let alone a page, let alone the entire book, while still making complete sense in Aramaic, then Luxenberg&#x27;s claim really does not carry any weight. You should know better than to accept something like this without solid proof. It even says on the Wikipedia page that &quot;That idea is in serious disagreement with the views of both traditional Muslims and western scholars of Islam&quot;!<p>The Google links you mentioned really don&#x27;t mean anything if you want to be &quot;scientific&quot; Oh look what I found here [1] 84,500,000 results! 10 times the number you listed! Of course, I won&#x27;t use that argument since it does not make sense.<p>It is possible to understand parts of the Quran with elementary knowledge of Arabic (and I know because we studied it in grade school, middle school, and high school). It does have intricate parts, sure. The language of the Quran did play a role in converting people back when it was revealed, because it was unique -- yet still understandable.<p>If you really want to continue the discussion, my email address is in my profile page. Though, I would appreciate if you were to lose the attitude, and be willing to look at things in a less biased way.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.quran-m.com/firas/ar_photo/1263930976161291c.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quran-m.com/firas/ar_photo/1263930976161291c.jpeg</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=quran+hard+to+read#q=bible++hard+to+read"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=quran+hard+to+read#q=bible++...</a>",1396990157

Some of the things that bit us:<p>* Strong parameters means you&#x27;re going to have to figure out what everything needs for params or break down and call permit! where acceptable. If anyone got crazy with attribute metaprogramming bullshittery, you&#x27;re in for fun.<p>* The deep_munge part of strong parameters has some strong opinions about how it should do its job. The code is there to prevent attacks where unusual user input is handed directly to ActiveRecord and interpreted by it. One special case to look out for is that it will rewrite a (JSON-supplied) empty array into nil, which makes life fun if your API happens to put some semantic meaning on nil vs. empty arrays.<p>* The new restrictions on routing verbs are good stuff, but I can almost guarantee that something was getting away with using the wrong verb before.<p>* XML parameter parsing has been extracted to a plugin. For some reason XML generation wasn&#x27;t, but if people are sending you XML data you&#x27;ll need this: <a href=""https://github.com/rails/actionpack-xml_parser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/actionpack-xml_parser</a><p>That&#x27;s all I can think of off the top of my head.<p>In response to this:<p>> Does that mean I need to go through and rewrite all our models and controllers before we can update?<p>Not really, no. As a first step we rewrote all of our attr_accessible usage into model class-level constants we could run through strong_parameters. Eventually those moved out of the model, but it was good enough to get going. Example:<p># Rails 3.2<p>class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base<p><pre><code>  attr_accessible :name, :bar, :whatever\n\n  attr_accessible :name, :bar, :whatever, :approved, :as => :admin\n</code></pre>\nend<p># Rails 4.0<p>class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base<p><pre><code>  UPDATEABLE_ATTRIBUTES = [:name, :bar, :whatever]\n\n  ADMIN_UPDATEABLE_ATTRIBUTES = UPDATEABLE_ATTRIBUTES + [:approved]\n</code></pre>\nend",1396990024

(This may be a good thing [consistency], but I think it&#x27;d be nice to be able to add custom CSS to the pricing dialog.)<p>My large problem is that the price is crazy; your 50 cent per transaction fee means that for all transactions under $7 you collect more in fees than Stripe does. With a $5 payment - very common for services such as the one I&#x27;ll release soon - I&#x27;m paying 20% to you. With a $1 payment, I pay a prohibitive 83% in fees. That&#x27;s a really large cut compared to using the Stripe API directly, and I think that for anyone looking to increase their profits it&#x27;s a no-brainer to cut Snappy Checkout out of the equation.<p>To give a personal example, my service will be primarily receiving $5 payments. For the first 1000 payments or so, I&#x27;ll probably stick with Snappy - the $500 I give up isn&#x27;t worth the time I would&#x27;ve spent rolling my own solution. However, as soon as I can see that there&#x27;s a clear market for my product, I&#x27;ll roll my own with Stripe - I clearly wouldn&#x27;t want to give up 20% to payment processing alone.<p>Meanwhile, Frank is selling antique vases on Facebook for $1.5k each, and he pays 50 cents a transaction to you.<p>However, if you were to switch to a flat fee + a percentage (say 1.5% and 15 cents), as Stripe does, you would probably retain my business for a lot longer. Suddenly, I pay a 4.5% cut to you as opposed to a 10% cut, which is quite reasonable. At the same time, Frank the antique vase seller doesn&#x27;t really care about a 1.5% fee: a win-win situation.<p>tl;dr I recommend that you change to a percentage of the total sales: sellers of cheap items will use your service and sellers of expensive items won&#x27;t care.

Almost all the models indicate that ENSO-neutral (Niño-3.4 index between -0.5oC and 0.5oC) will persist through the rest of the Northern Hemisphere spring 2014 (Fig. 6). While all models predict warming in the tropical Pacific, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether El Niño will develop during the summer or fall. If westerly winds continue to emerge in the western equatorial Pacific, the development of El Niño would become more likely. However, the lower forecast skill during the spring and overall propensity for cooler conditions over the last decade still justify significant probabilities for ENSO-neutral. The consensus forecast is for ENSO-neutral to continue through the Northern Hemisphere spring 2014, with about a 50% chance of El Niño developing during the summer or fall (click CPC/IRI consensus forecast for the chance of each outcome).<p>sooo flip a coin i guess?<p><a href=""http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/en...</a>\n<a href=""http://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso/current/?enso_tab=enso-cpc_plume"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso...</a>",1396989634

So while you could use wheels, you would still want the current to flow through the entire(or large portion) of the projectile housing(for lack of a better term). This leads to the second issue.<p>2) Melting. With these huge amperage&#x27;s there is also huge heat levels. If you were to conduct this much current through a small point(as would be the case with a wheel) the heat generated would be even worse.

7555837,comment,7552863,7555431,3,0,vbuterin,,,"So the actual protocol change that needs to be made in order to make challenge-response protocols fully effective is basically the inclusion of merkle-sum-trees - make each node N = [ H, F ] where H = sha256(N.child0, N.child1) and F = N.child0.F + N.child1.F. Otherwise, there&#x27;s no way to efficiently prove that a block does not have excessive fees. Unless you do some crazy ugly hack like creating a separate overlay merkle tree with its root being output 1 of the coinbase, that&#x27;s a hard-forking protocol change.<p>As for changes actually being implemented, to be honest I haven&#x27;t seen anything actually substantial since P2SH. The one big change that would benefit everyone now, increasing the block size limit, has been on the table for a year now with absolutely no progress toward pushing it through. If it does come close to happening, then I&#x27;ll publish a  bitcoinmagazine article cheering it on. For now though, it seems as far away as ever.<p>What I generally want to say when I make such statements in blog posts is &quot;We _plan_ to do something that others have not yet _put into practice_&quot;; of course, that just means we&#x27;re equal and not better, but the point is to say that we&#x27;re moving quickly and we&#x27;ll get there soon. Bitcoin is currently a slow-moving target, and it given the $5 billion of existing capital stored inside of it it would be irresponsible to do things any other way; so I think it&#x27;s unlikely that Bitcoin will develop second-layer scalability protocols first. If you wish to wait for actual results then that is a philosophy that I very much respect.<p>I have realized over time that pretty much nothing in Ethereum is new; Turing-complete contracts were in Ripple and Qixcoin (although I was not _thinking of_ either one of those two, and I did not even realize that Ripple contracts were Turing-complete, when I came up with the idea), Patricia tries I got from Alan Reiner back in 2012, all sorts of clever blockchain designs were mulled over on bitcointalk in 2009, and that doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe the legions of forgotten hackers on cypherpunk mailing lists in the 1990s. A few weeks ago I learned about the concept of &quot;rules engines&quot;. And then of course there&#x27;s Yap stones. Meanwhile, Vertcoin is coming up with a memory hard proof of work that claims to be revolutionary and powerful but runs into a fundamental scalability issue that I solved months ago with Dagger. So perhaps I do need to tone down my &quot;this is amazing and new&quot; rhetoric; but at the same I&#x27;ve come to realize that since we are philosophically similar people attacking similar problems some degree of collision, whether of the &quot;independent discovery&quot; form or the &quot;heard about it, forgot it, reinvented it without realizing&quot; form is inevitable.",1396989332

7555757,comment,7555048,7555048,1,0,benaiah,,,"I think one of the large problems with the web app space is display. There is no way for a good web app to be put front and center and displayed to users; all the web app marketplaces (I say all, but Chrome Web Store seems to be the only one that actually matters) are cluttered, confusing, filled with links to websites masquerading as apps, and generally useless; and the installation process is cumbersome, unnatural, obtuse, and requires understanding of a device and abstraction of concepts about a device on a level most users simply don&#x27;t grok. Yes, most web apps that directly compete with native apps are worse, but there are times when I, as a computer-literate developer, wish I could effectively use a web app, but simply have no way to integrate it with the way I work in a way that actually saves me time.<p>The web app evengelists (of which I am certainly one) often miss the importance of the little affordances that web apps don&#x27;t have. This is both on the user and developer side, though the problem is primarily on the user&#x27;s side, as developers can work around things. It is <i>tremendously</i> important that I be able to get instantly into my app by typing in my normal application launcher. I want to use the app without having to think about the technologies undergirding it first. It is <i>tremendously</i> important that I be able to silo a web app to its own window and be able to alt-tab between it and my browser. It is <i>tremendously</i> important that my basic shortcuts work in the app without doing strange things and occasionally killing it all together.<p>The problem is, this can&#x27;t be achieved without large amounts of work from either the user (standard web apps with an arcane mix of desktop shortcuts or their equivalent and bizarre browser configuration), the developer (node-webkit apps like Atom or Light Table), or both (Chrome packaged apps, which manage to combine the worst of pretty much every world).<p>Ironically, the system on which web apps work best as part of the system, bar none (except ChromeOS because duh), is iOS, and even it has fundamental issues (no background persistence, easy to follow a link and be unable to go back to where you came from, various UI standards not working by default with the web) that make web apps, even the best of them, stand out like a sore thumb.<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of work recently to fix this, but we&#x27;re simply not to the point that web apps are anywhere in the same universe as indistinguishable from native apps. Personally, I have an optimistic view of the future in regards to the issue, but I also see Gruber&#x27;s point: we web evengelists are being unrealistic when we blame the current failure of the web as an application delivery system for general-purpose applications for both desktop and mobile on some Apple&#x27;s nefarious &quot;closed garden&quot; or other such complaints. Reality is, the web isn&#x27;t there yet, and until it is, the web we have is the one we have, and we shouldn&#x27;t be bemoaning the death of open standards while the whole world is speaking HTTP, just because our specific darlings aren&#x27;t up to par yet.<p>This was slightly longer than intended.

If you do use it, expect your javascript to break at one point or another. The jquery.turbolinks gem helps, but I&#x27;ve still had to debug a bunch of funky behavior with it.<p>2) Strong parameters takes a while to get used to from the old attr_accessesible way of doing things. That being said, I think it&#x27;s worth it to learn it. It prevents a lot of conditional attr_accessible :blah, :as => :admin that goes on. The one thing I&#x27;d say is if you are going to use strong parameters, you might want to install a gem like Annotate so you can keep track of your attributes in the models. Sure you can just look in Schema.rb, but tabbing back and forth gets to be kind of a pain.<p>3) Secrets.yml is great, no more worrying about adding your config.secret_token to the .env file when generating every single project.<p>4) Mail Preview is nice, but for some reason I still seem to use Mailcatcher mostly to view / see how emails render out. Think this is mostly me sticking to my own ways.<p>5) ActionController::Live still feels pretty half baked. The fact that most examples / tutorials on the web still use the default example of:<p><pre><code>    100.times {\n      response.stream.write &quot;hello world\\n&quot;\n      sleep 1\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSeems quite telling. It feels like they&#x27;ve given some of the pieces to get live streaming working flawlessly, but we are still missing a few tools here.<p>----<p>The biggest problem I&#x27;ve had is that some gems that we used frequently would break because they weren&#x27;t Rails 4 ready. We use ActiveAdmin pretty frequently in our client apps, and it&#x27;s worked for a while, but it&#x27;s always been on a custom branch and still had some issues that were just recently fixed. YMMV for gems that your app relies on in terms of what will break and what will work.",1396988401

7555747,comment,7525198,7554691,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"I think there is a great deal of merit in the claim that practicing homosexuals threaten society. I have explained my reasoning elsewhere. You may disagree with me, but you cannot say that I have an unreasoned or stupid opinion. It should also be noted that until very recently, the criminality of homosexuality was obvious and every jurisdiction punished it as sodomy. Perhaps everyone that ever lived prior to 1970 was hateful and stupid, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s exceptionally likely. My opinion is simply that they were more in touch with reality and didn&#x27;t have the insane invincibility complex that we have now.<p>My religion is not part of my nature. You may want to look up that word, &quot;nature&quot;. While religion or other matters of belief and practice may be very important to me, they are not &quot;natural&quot;, and I wouldn&#x27;t claim that someone was assaulting my very nature as a human because they didn&#x27;t like one element of my personal belief or conduct. I suggest homosexuals drop the inconsistent, unjustifiable victim narrative and get some perspective. And for the record, my religion has been criminalized repeatedly in the good old U.S.A.<p>I can and do live and let live. I have no interest in guiding the affairs of other persons&#x27; lives, I only have interest in preventing criminal activity that jeopardizes the survival of our society. I believe homosexual conduct is such a criminal activity. Reasonable people can debate whether that is a valid position without feeling that their natures have been denigrated. Gay rights dudes are doing what gay rights dudes always do, turtling up and screaming that they&#x27;re oppressed because someone tried to confront them with information that they couldn&#x27;t contest rationally.<p>I agree that for now, gay rights people are winning. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s because their logic is prevailing, I think it&#x27;s because the strength and intelligence of normal people is failing. I think it is idolatry at its core, self-worship. And I believe that in a short time, society will reap the consequences of all of that, which are utter destruction and extinction.

That&#x27;s good enough for a better-than-acceptable (not optimal, but from a pace or two away most people wouldn&#x27;t notice) tabloid/A3 print without uprezzing. And there is enough data to support substantial uprezzing before the image goes wonky for those inclined to do so.<p>Now, yer average pro doesn&#x27;t tend to indulge in the pixel-peeping game (except in private, with the lights down low and the door locked, and always washes his/her hands afterwards), and tends to be reluctant to give away images that can still sell - or at least would prefer it if people kept their own Photoshop/Gimp chocolate out of their personal peanut butter. Even when the images are offered as freebies, there is no reason to force a viewer to download more than they need to make decisions; the hi-rez image will sit behind a link, to be opened at the viewer&#x27;s discretion.

I would be very surprised if some of my operations haven&#x27;t been targeted by this.<p>Many of the groups targeted are involved with actively investigating human rights abuses conducted by many countries in the world - including the USA in  Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, drone strikes, secret prisons, etc. I fail to see exactly what the US National Security interest is in investigating these groups (Caveat: not all NGOs worldwide should be outside scrutiny, ie ones which funnel arms to Al Qaeda obviously but these ones certainly don&#x27;t do that). The security community (as has happened in many countries over the years - the UK in Northern Ireland for example) has confused &quot;National Security&quot; with &quot;embarrassment.&quot; I say &quot;security community&quot; as there are many fantastic people within US government and private institutions that are capable of looking at the long-term interest and are doing a good job of supporting human rights and freedom on the internet. For example, it is a credit that so much great work like The Guardian Project and Whisper Systems is underway to address such problems.<p>Human rights groups and journalists have been consistently the victim of high-level APT from China, Russia and elsewhere - there are many cases documented online. Many of these have been targeted through the exact same methods that large corporations like banks, defence companies, nuclear energy businesses. It&#x27;s somehow morally wrong that organisations like GCHQ and the NSA actively thwart attacks (and share information) on such companies, while ignoring and obviously exploiting threats against human rights groups (which often end in the deaths of human rights defenders, aid workers and journalists).<p>The long-term national interest of the USA and other countries is the spread of our good values - freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, self determination, respect for international law etc. The &quot;war on terror&quot; has caused too many to lose sight of these soft-power instruments and that is a pity.

7555652,comment,7555048,7555549,1,0,benaiah,,,"I agree wholeheartedly. I do personally prefer the web for application delivery from a developer&#x27;s standpoint, and I find it quite simple to create sites that function well on a mobile form factor. It&#x27;s curious, then, that more don&#x27;t exist. I&#x27;m no hyper-talented guru, and my apps are reasonably representative of most light-workload thin-client apps, so I&#x27;m unsure of the problem.<p>The biggest problem I&#x27;ve found with mobile apps built with browser technology, personally, is that they often give none of the affordances of a native app <i>and</i> none of the affordances of the web. They become so obsessed with poorly aping native technologies* that they often fail to play to their strengths - things like deep-linking, tabbed browsing, lightweight usage, hypermedia, and so on. I don&#x27;t really get it.<p>I suspect that the reason is due to the fact that people who are good enough to write a mobile web app that works well are simply not doing so, either because that&#x27;s not what they do or because they prefer working in native technologies. Meteor+Bootstrap+Hammer+basic googling gets you head and shoulders above most people in the mobile webapp world, but that&#x27;s not the status quo, despite those being some of the easiest-to-use frameworks I&#x27;ve ever worked with in the web space.<p>I suspect, but I really just don&#x27;t know. <i>shrugs</i><p>* Yes, some are as good as mobile apps, and it&#x27;s not very difficult to be vastly better than the vast majority of mobile web apps, but good web app UXs remain rare birds for whatever reason",1396987318

Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know the completely status of it or what product&#x27;s have been out, I do however know that it <i>does</i> work (I worked for my Dad for a summer internship and witnessed it first-hand), and that you need to be careful when diving into them. The side-effects vary depending on the type of stimulation (AC or DC) as well the frequency used, but they <i>can</i> result in nerve damage.<p>Specifically, it&#x27;s known (At least, it was known among the group I worked with, and I saw this result happen) that extended use of the DC block will damage the nerve (On higher frequencies - IIRC 40hz was the highest we tested). AC doesn&#x27;t have that issue, but AC has the issue that it actually sends a fairly large signal back up the nerve when it&#x27;s turned on (So you feel a sharp pain when you turn it on). I couldn&#x27;t tell you how bad it is since I&#x27;ve never felt it, but obviously it&#x27;s still useable if Ex. you just turn it on to go to sleep at night.<p>Now, something unfortunate I feel obligated to tell you is that not to long ago my Dad traveled to go give a talk at a conference relating to a company that&#x27;s been marketing a pain-relief type stimulator with no side-effects. From what my Dad saw, the block was mostly from nerve damage being created from the stimulation (I apologize, I don&#x27;t remember all the specific details). Bottom line, I&#x27;d research any company you&#x27;re considering getting a stimulator from.<p>Note: I&#x27;m more knowledgeable then the average person, but I&#x27;m no biomedical engineer. Definitely look into this stuff yourself and get other opinions. I do know it&#x27;s definitely worth looking into.",1396987227

Many people, particularly lower income people, have a smart phone but no computer. At the same time, municipal Fiber is incredibly expensive. Chatanooga spent $330 million plus on their network, to wire up about 71,000 subscribers. Plus, maintenance of that infrastructure is very expensive. Given that most states and municipalities are broke, and have neglected crucial electric and water infrastructure that already exists, they can&#x27;t afford to take on the cost of a Fiber network.",1451440762

Copyright precedent in the 9th Circuit is set by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and by the Supreme Court, and that is also the normal appeals path from the district courts in the 9th Circuit.<p>When a case involves patents the appeals path is to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and then to the Supreme Court. CAFC rulings on patent issues set precedent for all district courts.<p>Not so for CAFC rulings on copyright issues. 9th Circuit district courts, for instance, considering API copyrights in the future will continue to look to what the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has said on this. What the CAFC has said is no more binding on them than what the 5th Circuit or the 7th Circuit or any other non-9th Circuit, non-Supreme Court court has said.<p>This is a pretty messed up situation. When CAFC gets something like a copyright issue that comes along for the ride on a patent issue, they are supposed to follow the precedent of the circuit from whence the case came on that non-patent issue.<p>If they botch that, there is nowhere to appeal to except the Supreme Court. But since the CAFC ruling on the non-patent issue won&#x27;t be binding on anyone except the parties in that one case, it is not likely that the Supreme Court will take the appeal. Eventually, the issue will arise again in that same district, but without being attached to a patent case, and then can be appealed to the Court of Appeals for that circuit where they can clarify what the correct interpretation is in their circuit.",1451440161

This is Google moving to protect itself going forward after it lost the case in the Federal Circuit. That case was sent back down to the lower court only for ruling if Google&#x27;s use of Oracle&#x27;s now apparently copyrighted APIs consists of &quot;Fair Use&quot;. Since APIs are now copyrightable I don&#x27;t see how copying thousands of APIs could possibly consist of &quot;Fair Use&quot; so it&#x27;s looking like Oracle is going to get paid, big time. And Oracle will probably demand a royalty for every phone sold. So in order for Google to avoid paying that royalty going forward they need to move to OpenJDK quickly with their next release, with the belief that using Oracle&#x27;s GPL JDK implementation also gives them a license to the API. Problem for Google is that OEM and user adoption of new Android versions is slow, it takes several years for phones with old versions to stop selling, and Oracle will get a cut of each sale.<p>In any case, I think this is a healthy development for Java developers and the Java ecosystem. Java has been effectively forked between Android and other uses and this will unify the language again. And it will bring the cool new Java 8 features to Android.",1451438232

When I first started using Python many years ago, I was doing contract work for the SciPy/NumPy folks (Enthought), and Python was still a blip in the scientific world...Java and Fortran and a bit of C++ ruled the commercial world, with Mathematica and MatLab handling the academic side of things (with some overlap and some outliers).<p>It&#x27;s really cool to see. I like seeing science democratized, and Python is definitely a democratizing influence, and the fact that so much of it is open source is really fantastic. I&#x27;ve also noticed that a lot more domain experts are becoming programmer+domain experts through this evolution. It used to be that there were teams with a scientist to design it and one or more programmers to implement it, and that&#x27;s becoming less of a requirement, which can accelerate the science-ing to a notable degree.",1451437672

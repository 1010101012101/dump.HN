On the other hand the meltdown has already happened, so the prices have been corrected already.<p>- On the other hand, using the stock-market by investing for the long-term is the biggest crap someone can sell you. There are better ways to invest for the long term, assuming you have more money.<p>- $2000 may be a lot to you, but it's not a lot of money. So assuming you are a fast learner, want high returns and you have the risk gene, I would recommend learn forex instead. You will learn a lot more in 6 months than what you will learn investing for the stock-market. You will probably lost at least 50% of your capital but you can't learn if you don't burn real money.",1232419830

We tell them all what they're signing up for depending on whether they take angel money or VC, and at what valuation.<p>If you sign up for VC, you're signing up to take over the world-- to at least try to get IPO huge (even though IPOs themselves have currently disappeared).  This is ok with founders who were planning to anyway.  Founders who aren't sure, or are sure they aren't, should only take angel money.<p>Though nearly all later stage investors want a veto on acquisitions, the point where they'll exercise it varies a lot.  It depends mostly on the valuation.  As a rule no investor is happy with less than a 5x return, unless the valuation was huge (e.g. in mezzanine round) or the company is in trouble.  Over 5x they may still grumble, but most will let you sell the company if you really want to.   Or they'll arrange for founders to sell some of their shares privately.  Over 10x they'll generally be pretty happy.",1232419822

441259,comment,441156,441156,0,0,nas,,,"Read ""The Intelligent Investor"".  It was written many years ago and is still relevant today (it's actually scary how history seems to repeat itself).  Regarding fees, note that commissions are not the only costs to transactions.  Remember the bid/ask spread and that as a small investor you will be taken advantage of.<p>Long term is the way to go, IMHO.  It is nearly impossible to predict short term price movements.  Also, forget the efficient market hypotheses; if the SP500 can go up 5% one day and down 5% the next it's obviously bogus.  You can count on the average stock owner to be either overly optimistic or overly pessimistic (and not just a little bit).  Do you homework first and keep your head.<p>Find companies with business models you can understand: how are they making revenue, what are their costs, what are their risks?  Use discounted cash flows (i.e. NPV) to find a fair market price (P/E is good rough estimate).  Be very conservative when doing this, especially with regards to expected EPS and growth.  Double digit growth <i>cannot</i> be maintained and generally high growth companies are overvalued.  Most libraries have S&P reports that you can study for free (good for EPS data although take it with a grain of salt).  Some discount brokers also offer stock reports.  Note that analysis recommendations are usually bogus but it doesn't hurt to take note.<p>Index funds are a good way to diversity but watch out for fees (I like Vanguard, especially their ETFs) and too much portfolio turnover (some are just badly designed).  However, it's my opinion that you can do better than the indexes with a little common sense (see above) and if you can stomach the extra risk.  Stick to large cap stocks because they are more liquid and less susceptible to insider information.  It doesn't hurt to look at insider activity (although note the effects of stock options).<p>$2000 is not much money, probably not enough to start messing with individual stocks.  I would stick it low fee, value ETF and forget about it.  $10,000 is probably a more reasonable starting amount, say 25% in high-grade bonds, 25% in a index fund, and 50% in individual stocks of your choosing (say 2 or 3).",1232419533

441256,comment,441156,441197,0,0,hotpockets,,,"I have this theory that small transaction size actually confers a small advantage.  You never have to worry about having enough orders on the other side of the transaction, thus you can do any transaction at the lowest price offered. Whereas big bid orders are basically the average price of the N lowest offer prices.  I have no facts or experience on this, just a theory.<p>In other words there may be profitable techniques that are impossible for the big boys to use, simply because they can't be bothered with tiny investments.<p>Also, I thought you could eliminate transaction costs using a broker like zecco.  Such a broker might invalidate my above theory though, if it were true.",1232419380

RDBMSs with hash indexes are commonplace, and allow O(1) lookups and a b+-tree lookup over a few million rows only does a few I/Os (the fanout in a typical disk-based tree index is on the order of 100, and the nodes in the first level or two of the tree are likely to be cached). Any differences in <i>scalability</i> has more to do with architectural differences (easier to do horizontal partitioning with key-value stores, no need/expectation of ACID transactions, no need to parse + optimize queries at runtime, no need for a complex query executor, etc.)<p>But I agree that a SQL RDBMS allows much more flexible ad-hoc queries than a key-value store does.",1232419336

You should probably look into passive investing. You will get much larger returns investing in yourself than trying to speculate on the market.<p>If you do want to speculate, you might want to look into index verticals. They limit your risk (50-150 loss max ) and have less comission vs trading stock ($3 vs $10). You'll at least lose money more slowly. And your delta risk initially isn't a lot so you can unwind a position with much less loss early than if you were to get into futures/stock.<p>Me personally I trade options using technical and sentimental analysis, which is heresy around these ""effecient market"" places.<p>Oh, and don't listen to Cramer or CNBC.

441243,comment,441156,441156,0,0,jhp,,,"Here are some things to keep in mind:<p>- I think that it is best to invest directly in securities (only resorting to index funds if you really must outsource your thinking). You'll learn the most if you make the big decisions.<p>- Learn how to analyze the public information available. Cash flows. Balance sheets. Income statements. Get an accounting book! Learn about the types of securities and alternatives to equity investing (especially the various kinds of bonds).<p>- Market prices are based on combination of innumerable emotional and rational reactions to the real value of the companies behind the shares. Only over the long term will the price reflect the real value of these businesses. At any point, the price can be completely outside of reason, so beware of and be ready to take advantage of the stupidity of crowds.<p>- Invest in types of businesses that you can understand, or plan on spending lots of time researching ""in the field"". Really focus on a few. When I was buying shares of Nabisco, I was spending late nights in the cookie aisle at Vons. When I started buying Apple, I spent serious time at their first toe-hold at CompUSA and later at their stores. I recently spent time at the Crocs stand at the mall to evaluate this company.<p>- Learn the different investment mental models and build one for yourself. Graham. Buffett. Munger. Lynch. Fisher.<p>- Learn about related fields. Psychology. Macroeconomics. Patent law. Whatever is important to industries that you are going to focus on.<p>- Keep investing. When you are 40 or 50 years old you might be half-good at it.",1232418618

441239,comment,441156,441224,0,0,vlad,,,">> Oh, it's a game all right.  You want to make as many dollars as possible by playing the game right.<p>No, you don't.  You want to make as many dollars as possible regardless of what you're doing, be it trading stocks or otherwise.  But with trading, you're risking what you already have, so you want to invest, and not confuse the word investing with gambling.  And with that, it's entirely possible that not investing in the stock market whatsoever may be your best option throughout your whole life, if you're a software developer.  If you're not one, then try to run a business in a different area to learn about the way things work, while saving your money to make a very reasonable bet on a few bets, not feeling like you have to have your money tied in the stock markets just because other people do.<p>Now, if we knew that the stock market in general would go up 5-15% on average every year for the next 40 years, that would be different, and I would buy an index fund at the very minimum.  But we do not know what will happen, nor can we even slightly base our financial decisions on what happened before.  That would not be investing, that would be time machine traveling or being hopeful things will work out.  And as software developers, we have more control over more things such that running one's own tech business while learning about new developments will put us in the right mindset to understand and evaluate the rare great buys in the stock market correctly, as well as how consumers think based on having first hand experience running a company oneself.<p>And true investing is not just putting money into ""the stock market"" void every month, but actually following developments and researching every week for at least an hour a week per stock (this is actually Cramer's advice.)  And you want to have 5 stocks to diversify (Cramer's advice.)  So with those 5 hours a week, could you not create and maintain a web app, or two or three?  Have fun reading Hacker News like you normally might do, sure, whether you invest in stock or not.  But just take the time you would spend researching and discussing the companies you hold (as well as new companies you might be interested in) and take that time to actually develop software.  In either case, you might only make a few hundred or thousand dollars a year profit.  That alone shows you might as well be investing in yourself.  But that's not all!<p>With creating your own software, you learned new skills, kept current ones sharp, created a portfolio, became confident in yourself, and all of this may raise your salary by $20,000-$50,000 a year and work the same amount of hours,  be confident in pursuing contracting opportunities based on the evidence you can create stuff, sell off various web apps you created, even for just a few thousand, and establish a reputation.  So those hundred to thousand dollars a year, or any money made, or even a loss of $200-$500 a year due to web hosting and such and zero profit, can easily return ten, twenty, or thirty thousand dollars for a 21 year old, more than anything else, in just one year.<p>But with ""investing"" as a 21 year old, making a hundred or thousand dollars a year is about the best you could do.  In fact, it is possible to lose the entire investment, as well.  So the net return might be negative (e.g. you'd be better off not putting money in the stock market.)  Subtract account fees as well.  And now, subtract all that research you did, and how many hours you spent on it, at let's say $10-$30 an hour.  And subtract the lost opportunity cost of being able to have used that time to create anything, anything at all for experience and other reasons I mentioned previously!  Subtract the stress and worry!<p>Let's go nuts here.  Even if you were guaranteed not to lose money you invest in the stock market, and you turn your $2,000 into $4,000, and let's say you did it by luck so you spent zero hours researching anything and just left your money in the account, investing the time and money towards furthering your own education is just a much better use of resources for a 21 year old, even in the best case scenario here.<p>And, as he mentioned he has debts, he should just try to pay them off.  If the debt is at 7% for college, 15% credit card, and other, pay those off first!",1232418473

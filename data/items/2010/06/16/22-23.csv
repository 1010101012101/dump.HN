1437325,comment,1436785,1437289,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"The part I was disagreeing with is that Scala gives programmers more ""rope to hang themselves with"".  You may be correct that restricting what programmers could do was a goal of Java, but writing Java in practice gives a tremendous number of opportunities to hang oneself.  Apologies for not being more clear.<p>Further, it's not like this complexity is something that arose independently of Java itself.  One of the most frequently cited examples of super-complicated insanity in the Java world is J2EE, which is a standard and set of libraries created by Sun itself.  If the creators of language have managed to create and propagate one of the biggest tarpits available in Java, that reflects poorly on the overall Java ecosystem.",1276729189

Presumably a technologically adept adversary would be able to bypass these sorts of interruptions and would maintain some form of ""shadow network"" to keep their access.<p>I personally think that creating this capability is a bad idea for two reasons; it weakens the redundancy of the network, and it provides an attractive target for black hat hackers.

1437316,comment,1436785,1437234,0,0,sreque,,,"I agree that Scala will never be a good replacement for languages Ruby both because of its complexity and the fact that dynamic languages are always going to be more flexible than statically typed languages. The fact that majority of new languages are in fact dynamic ones is also a good indication of the inherent difficulty in designing a good statically typed language. Scala is a much grander project in scope than Clojure, Ruby, Python, Groovy, or pretty much any of the dynamic languages sprouting up on the JVM probably ever will be. For instance, because these languges are dynamic, they don't care to deal directly with things like the cost of autoboxing, the price of type erasure, the ugly hackery that is java arrays, and so on. Life is simple when everything is of type Object! Of course, this grander scope comes with a cost, and that cost is language complexity.<p>In my opinion, Scala's aim is to take on Java by providing a much more overall productive language than Java while still maintaining Java's performance. I feel it's very much akin to the goals of C++ versus C. Fortunately, the people behind Scala are well versed in PL theory and make sensible language design decisions, so at this point Scala is in little danger of someone writing an FQA on it any time soon.",1276728988

Was the concession made to AT&T, who would offer a cheap data plan in exchange for refraining from giving the platform away to Skype?

That's the point of using it — it was designed to restrict the kind of trouble programmers can get themselves into. If you're stuck with the JVM, I guess the question is: how much rope do you want to give your programmers? Scala is essentially the opposite answer to Java.\n</code></pre>\nThis was an interesting read but I disagree with this assertion.  Java's lack of power as a language hasn't meant that people haven't written huge, complex, unmaintainable messes with it.  Indeed, I think all the crazy dependency injection frameworks, configuration-by-XML, and other general insanity is due in part to the language's lack of power.  Things that are simple in other languages (say, dependency injection, which can be replaced with runtime stubbing in Ruby or mixing in traits in Scala) often require painful and complicated ad-hoc solutions in Java.<p>That said, it is possible to write code in Scala that requires a PhD in category theory to understand (see Scalaz), but there are also many examples of simple, functional, easy to understand code (see stuff that has come out of Twitter, like Kestrel or Nagatti).<p>I think in practice, working with the modern Java ecosystem gives one at least as much rope to hang oneself as using Scala does.",1276726021

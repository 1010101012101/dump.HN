Because if not, that comparison doesn&#x27;t strike me as unfair, given that he explicitly mentions memory bound situations. Furthermore, will an array of Integers be a tightly packed set of integers, or value references to Integers? In general Go&#x27;s equivalent to objects are structs, which seem to avoid this overhead of Java objects. Again, honest question; if Java can JIT all that away, awesome! :)<p>For the record, the people on the Go-nuts board are pretty adamant about microbenchmarks not being all that representative, <i>and</i> that people should give the JVM some time to do its optimisation (Robert Griesemer was one of the original programmers on the HotSpot compiler after all).",1402130723

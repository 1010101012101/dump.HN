Remember Schrodinger's cat? The cat is both dead and alive, until someone opens the box. The opening of the box gives the cat its new state of deadness or aliveness.<p>Quantum teleportation works through entangled particles. Entangled particles are, in some sense, the same particle in two places. An action on one entangled particle will instantly affect the other particle, including observation of the particle.<p>Suppose Alice and Bob share an entangled particle. Alice observes the particle on her end, collapsing it into one of four states. Which state it collapses into is and always will be completely random.<p>Bob's particle was instantaneously affected in one of four ways corresponding to those states. Trouble is, he doesn't know which way, and he can't do anything with his particle until he does.<p>Alice has to communicate to Bob in any regular way, through light, telephone or internet, what she observed on her end, so that Bob knows what exactly happened to his particle, and what to do with it.<p>So in this way, it really was instantaneous over a distance, but at the same time nothing useful happened faster than the speed of light.",1302954573

We are talking of <i>really</i> good people who, for whatever reason (often  family etc) do not <i>want</i> to work in the USA etc.<p>Salaries in Bangalore are heavily dependent on ""years of experience"". The way the HR folks calculate expected salary is something like 2-2.5 lakhs Indian rupees(about 4-5k US $ depending on the exchange rate) * number of years of experience. So with about 12 years of experience[1] you should be getting about 48-60k$ <i>if you are still coding and are at least somewhat good at your job. This is  the </i>average* though and falls precipitously as you move towards the bodyshopping end of the bell curve. (You can still make this kind of money as a manager though, even at  the most cheapskate bodyshopper)<p>The really good folks get better salaries than that. The interesting thing about  Bangalore is that the <i>range</i> of salaries is wide. You have barely literate ""coding bodies"" (who the ""outsourcers"" encounter) drawing puny salaries and also very senior devs who can pick and choose where and what they work on and get close to US salaries(and often have spent a few years in  the USA before heading home for good).<p>So yes 100k <i>is</i> high but not ridiculously so, (If by ""ridiculous"" you mean someone getting such a salary is some kind of absolute rarity, and an object of wonder when spotted).

And this is unrelated to the amount of money you spend.

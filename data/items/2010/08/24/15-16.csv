One could make the argument that articles favor sensationalism for the purpose of link-bait (or a less cynical argument might be that they subconsciously favor sensationalism to stand out from the crowd), but if a large portion of ""news"" is inherently inflammatory/hyperbolic, then I think a skeptical response is both warranted and natural.<p>Also, a lot of articles that get posted here are technical blog entries whereby someone makes a pronouncement on the positive or negative effects of some technology/methodology.

I will never carry a balance, and thus never accrue interest, unless there's a real emergency. If there's a real emergency, the amount of money it costs is not really a concern, the emergency is. That's what makes it an emergency, it's more important than money.<p>A credit card to me is just a convenient way to buy things online and in person without having to deal with cash.

The only thing that I know of is the variable length instruction encoding and these days, that seems helpful: it allows you to use smaller instructions which benefits caching. The extra cost of decoding instructions on silicon is negligible.<p>In general, I don't understand your comparison of RISC vs x86. The original premise of RISC, namely having very simple chips that can be clocked real fast because of their simplicity has long since been abandoned. Modern RISC chips have all the crazy complexity of x86 chips: you'll find big pipelines and dynamic register renaming and multiple execution units galore. And modern x86 chips internally look a lot like modern RISC chips as well: after they convert native instructions into micro-ops, there doesn't seem to be much difference.",1282665244

1630123,comment,1627246,1627246,0,0,nadam,,,"Basically good advice, but it also depends on the project. Some projects are too experimental for this.<p>My approach is the following with my startup project (but not with my day-job project):<p>I start to write this: brainstorm.txt<p>In brainstorm.txt I don't have to be concrete and concise. I just write down all kind of ideas.<p>After a while I start to write this: design.txt This is very concrete (factual) and concise. It is not an essay, it is not written for other people. It is just for myself: to make a conceptual skeleton. It is not too structured, because it is impossible if it is about an innovative product. The only way I can avoid chaos is that I apply extreme minimalism. (Minimalist things are easier to structure, and don't need to be too structured.) Meanwhile I start to write code, mostly bottom-up. And I continuously refine design.txt.<p>The User's guide (I call the Readme User's Guide) is already a quite different story for me. It must be written for the user and not myself. I don't like fluffy user's guides, but still it should not be as concise and as abstract as my notes to myself. If I would have to start with the User's Guide than my brain would work in a 'user's guide writer mode'. For me 'engineer/hacker mode' is different.",1282665164

I mean, there are easy tweaks to the copyright system that would alleviate the orphan works problem without interfering with the minuscule fraction of very old works that are still profitable.<p>The answer in both cases is regulatory capture. The parts of the government that would deal with this have lots of interaction with publishers and authors lobbying them. And those groups hate all the digitization plans.<p>From the perspective of a content producer, technology is the worst thing ever. Every year, technology advances and increases the number of ways that people can spend time not reading the works of any one author. A mass book digitization program would swamp the market with old books which means fewer sales for recently published books. It might allow people to get into hobbies that would sap up their time and prevent them from buying new books! Can you imagine if Wikipedia didn't exist?

Should I include this feature in the first release? -- If there's a significant chance that the feature will make the difference between your product having users and not having users, add it.  Otherwise don't.<p>2. I realized I definitely should have implemented Feature X differently.  Should I reimplement it before release? -- No, unless Feature X is core to your product and this reimplementation might make the difference between users/no users, or unless Feature X's implementation will have a significant impact on your application's architecture, and you still have a fair amount of coding to do prior to first release.<p>Obviously these are just heuristics.  For example, if including a feature would be as simple as changing a configuration directive, you can include it in the first release even if there's not a significant change it would make the difference between no users/users.  The way to think about it is that as a programmer, you've got kind of a potential possibility curve--when you're at your best, you can write clean performant code slowly, or featureful dirty nonperformant code quickly, etc.  And when you're rapid prototyping, you're optimizing to write nonfeatureful nonperformant moderately clean code quickly.",1282664712

If you want stability you should pick almost any other platform.<p>Claiming that Rails solves problems you ""do not have"" is blub thinking at its finest.  Okay, I'll grant you that the routing changes are perhaps a little gratuitous. But consider the replacement of the ad-hoc manual SQL generation by arel.  You will probably never even notice when this makes a query work that would have blown up before, or when your load times decrease because of lazy querying.<p>ActiveModel is another place where they've added huge power and flexibility.  The fact that you no longer have to use ActiveRecord to get some of its best functionality is a <i>huge</i> win.  Just because you haven't noticed how it might help you doesn't mean it won't if you give it a chance.<p>Even if you really don't need anything in Rails 3, it's still a straw man argument, because Rails 3 is all about modularization and embracing much wider development paradigms.  If you want to use RSpec and FactoryGirl now you can do so with fully integrated generators.  If ActiveRecord is useless to you, there is a well-defined API for any other ORM to integrate just as tightly.  More importantly, the APIs that the components use are now public and documented, and will remain stable over time.  This makes Rails useful for an order of magnitude more projects than it used to be.<p>Also, I should add that I'm in the same boat as you.  I have a 50,000 line/200 model app dating back 3.5 years, and the Rails 3 upgrade is going to be painful.

They even developed a theory for why they didn't have to listen to me: I'd hurt their feelings by criticizing their performance and capabilities; self-esteem was the most important thing in running a business; ergo, because I was injuring their self-esteem it was better if they just turned a deaf ear. I'm not sure how much time these three guys had ever spent with engineers. Chuck Vest, the president of MIT, in a private communication to some faculty, once described MIT as ""a no-praise zone"". My first week as an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student I asked a professor for help with a problem. He talked to me for a bit and then said ""You're having trouble with this problem because you don't know anything and you're not working very hard.""</i><p><a href=""http://waxy.org/random/arsdigita/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://waxy.org/random/arsdigita/</a><p>(I found this from a link in the footnotes of pg's essay ""A Unified Theory of VC Suckage"" <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html</a>)<p>In many areas in the hard sciences, maths and engineering, when you are wrong, you are wrong. No discussion. Many on HN have a background in these areas, hence their skeptical attitude to things that are fuzzy or as yet unproven (such as in the marketplace). People here often seem to assume that whatever is being discussed in a given article is dubious (or bullshit as the case may be). I believe this is healthy. The opposite attitude leads to all sorts of problems.",1282662212

When that happens, I often don't bother figuring out where I should look and give up.<p>I think you have the attitude that someone is already interested in what you've done. If that's true, then more information is better. You need to come at this from the perspective that most people won't care what you've done. You need to convince them you did something cool.

You need a group of skilled people around you to make it work. Oddly enough, that group of people starts looks a lot like a record label, or a publishing house.<p>If you have found a really good (or perhaps even tolerably good) record label or publisher, one that you trust, that pay you good advances and royalties, that have good people on board that you enjoy working with - then self publishing doesn't look like that attractive an option. It's certainly not an easy one.<p>Having said that, I think Charlie should give it a shot sooner rather than later, because his fanbase will be disproportionately well connected, which reduces the effort of marketing greatly.",1282662036

8771533,comment,8770505,8770505,0,0,cLeEOGPw,,,"Fuck the motivation. Motivation is a lazy man&#x27;s approach. It takes no effort. You have to force yourself. You have to learn to force yourself. Even if you get motivation, it is temporary. Real success comes from discipline and continuous effort. Drop the idea that you need motivation - just force yourself to learn Node right now. There&#x27;s no easy or lazy way to do it - you have to win over yourself.<p>Reason for this is that frontal cortex - part of brain responsible for your conscious actions - only finishes developing in mid 20s. You only recently finished that stage. Motivation is used in teen years, when more primitive parts of brain dominate frontal cortex. Now it&#x27;s time to take matters into your own hands.<p>After time goes on, it get&#x27;s easier and easier, and motivation comes as a result of forcing yourself to do it.",1418979489

Mark Zuckerberg saw nothing wrong with spending $19 billion of his shareholders&#x27; money on WhatsApp, a company that had IIRC somewhere around $30 million in revenue. However, there&#x27;s a big difference. The rest of Facebook is quite profitable. It might be somewhat overvalued, but it&#x27;s a real company.

This court exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction over U.S. citizens living in China.  Appeals were heard in the 9th Circuit.<p>What I find most intriguing (or appalling) is that a District Court judge in the Western District of Washington (State) held in 1942 that a U.S. citizen who was tried, convicted, and sentenced in the U.S. Court for China was not entitled to Constitutional rights.  Judge Black wrote in Casement v. Squier[0] that Petitioner Leroy Lomax, then-incarcerated on McNeil Island was &quot;mistaken in his contention that the Constitution of the United States guaranteed him a trial thousands of miles beyond the boundaries of the United States.&quot;  Lomax said that his confinement was unconstitutional because he had been denied a trial by jury (one of Americans, versus the bench trial he received).<p>Judge Black quoted the U.S. Supreme Court decision In re Ross[1], where Justice Field wrote &quot;[t]he Constitution can have no operation in another country.&quot;  Thus, the Petitioner in Casement was denied habeus corpus.<p>I&#x27;ve not studied law, so I&#x27;d like to hope that this was &quot;clarified&quot; or overturned, though I don&#x27;t hold much hope.<p>0 - <a href=""http://www.leagle.com/decision/194234246FSupp296_1271"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leagle.com/decision/194234246FSupp296_1271</a><p>1 - <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/140/453/case.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/140/453/case.htm...</a>",1418979069

Such surname measures reveal that the typical estimate of parent–child correlations in socioeconomic measures in the range of 0.2–0.6 are misleading about rates of overall social mobility. Measuring education status through Oxbridge attendance suggests a generalized intergenerational correlation in status in the range of 0.70–0.90. Social status is more strongly inherited even than height. This correlation is unchanged over centuries. Social mobility in England in 2012 was little greater than in preindustrial times. Thus there are indications of an underlying social physics surprisingly immune to government intervention.*<p>Gregory Clark, co-author of the above article wrote an excellent book, <i>The Son Also Rises</i>, the topic of the linked article about his research into social mobility.

8771516,comment,8747053,8747523,0,0,orangecomputer,,,"I guess it was for two reasons. Looong post ahead but it describes in a fair amount of detail why I eventually was turned off of C programming, and it was not necessarily the language itself.<p>1) I opted to try and self-teach using tutorials which were highly inconsistent with one-anothers practices instead of learning at an accredited college or doing some type of course. It&#x27;s also possible the tutorials I used were not that brilliant. I did find some fantastic ones later on around the time I stopped (as I started working full time).<p>2) I believe my folly also lies in jumping the gun, a lot. With BASIC I was able to just skip around in the commands list and experiment with each command in an afternoon, figure out how it worked and see if it was what I needed. If so, I had learnt what I needed, if not, I had learnt something for use in another day, and another code. It mightn&#x27;t be the most optimal way to learn, but for me it allowed me to create -exactly- what I had intended, even if the mechanics inside were smoking and banging around, they still did what they needed to.<p>C was just not quite the same, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be. It&#x27;s a much more powerful language from what I&#x27;ve observed.<p>One of the issues I frequently stumbled into, would be a tutorial that would state to use an external library/header that was never explained nor included on the tutorial page. One might state that I needed to include SDL.H but at no point in the tutorial, did it describe what the contents of it were, or of its purpose / where to get it. Now sure enough, you can google it and find that it refers to the Simple DirectMedia Library but am I wrong to think it&#x27;s not professional to write in references and sources in a tutorial intended for beginners? &quot;Figure it out / google it&quot; doesn&#x27;t always strike me as the best way to teach someone, but instead writing down a clear explanation of what is required and where it can be obtained etc.<p>I also had stumbled upon tutorials where the author had written their own custom headers for use with the code, but the headers themselves were not included for download or reference in that tutorial, nor the contents of them explained, so I&#x27;d often have no idea of what to substitute in place of that header or how to recreate that header accordingly.<p>I also became frequently discouraged by the responses I got when asking for help. It seemed that if I (as well as a LOT of other people, I saw this happen to a tonne of others) was stuck or unsure and made threads anywhere asking for a bit of advice or critique as to where I&#x27;ve gone wrong, I was constantly met with replies of either &quot;If you don&#x27;t even know the answer then you shouldn&#x27;t be programming.&quot; or &quot;The answer is obvious, programming is not for you.&quot; etc. I made a post at one point asking for a bit of advice on building a simple calculator once as one of my first few applications, and was met with responses of &quot;This is a HUGE waste of time, there&#x27;s already calculator sources out there available for download.&quot; which sort of missed the point; I was trying to make one, rather than plagurize someone elses. Getting questioned as to why you&#x27;re learning to code when you can just steal someone elses seems the wrong way to go.<p>Perhaps I was in the wrong communities for me, although interestingly enough there was a tech journal article that I had read not too long ago where a senior programmer slammed the sadly all-too-frequent types of these responses due to the fact that it discourages a lot of potentially good novice programmers, with people arguing for and against negative reinforcement. Personally, being told &quot;your code is shit, you&#x27;re definitely not made to be a coder&quot; isn&#x27;t really inspiration to me. Being told &quot;You&#x27;ve made an error here, this is what&#x27;s wrong, this is why it&#x27;s not working and this is how you fix it. Have another go at it.&quot; seems more appropriate. Sure a few people react to being told they&#x27;re not good enough by thinking &quot;Well fine, I&#x27;m going to beat you at that statement and do the BEST DAMN APPLICATION EVER&quot;, but to me, I don&#x27;t like to think of programming as a boot camp, but as learning just as you would if it were photoshop or 3dsmax, and I sure as hell didn&#x27;t hear people in any 3dsmax class I&#x27;ve attended saying &quot;You&#x27;re really bad at modeling, you should quit before you waste too much time on this.&quot;.",1418978868

I don&#x27;t understand why you imply in your answer that I didn&#x27;t understand this point. Regarding my comment about not copying data: it was based on the benchmark[1] as linked in the blog post. The parts you measure do not copy any of the user data! It only converts your internal vectors of user types to a list of vectors of u8 type. So what you are doing is essentially moving the data. But when using move semantics the size of the user data does not matter any more, so there won&#x27;t be a difference between your column layout and using the more complex types directly inside the vectors if measured the same way as in this benchmark. In my opinion your benchmark is flawed and does not support the argument you make in your blog post.<p>2. Ok yes that was bad wording on my side. If you provide adaptors for complex types with pointers like Vec than you can of course also serialize those.<p>3. I guess this is just about the same argument as point 2) and thus redundant.<p>I made the effort for you to write a serialization framework which does not do &quot;columnarization&quot; but which simulates row layout and also added an adaptor for vec and ran it with the same benchmark, and also reran the original columnar benchmark on my machine. Both benchmarks were compiled exactly the same way. You can find my code here[2]. Here are the results:<p>==============================<p>columnarization <uint> 12.1 GB/s, 742k values/s<p>columnarization <(uint, (uint, uint))> 5.3 GB/s, 107k values/s<p>columnarization <vec<uint>> 2.1 GB/s, 54k values/s<p>columnarization <Option<uint>> 1.58 GB/s, 163k values/s<p>==============================<p>row (simple_serialize) <uint> 12.1 GB/s, 730k values/s<p>row (simple_serialize) <(uint, (uint, uint))> 8.83 GB/s, 164 values/s<p>row (simple_serialize) <vec<uint>> 2.13 GB/s, 56 values/s<p>row (simple_serialize) <Option<uint>> 8.82 GB/s, 263k values/s<p>==============================<p>You see that columnization does not have a performance benefit in your benchmark and it even is significantly slower for Option<uint> type and pairs.<p>In your blog post you never mentioned that columnization will only has the potential to bring performance benefits to de-/serialization when using types with large padding overheads. I think this discussion would probably helped the blog post. It would be much better if it would either omit the currently wrong performance argument and just focus on the nicely typed API or if it would use a proper benchmark which would support your argument, which from my understanding would be only possible in a very limited set of use case scenarios.<p>Here is a list of other valid arguments you could have made instead:<p>* Format saves space at the cost of performance.<p>* Better than repr(packed) as it will also work on platforms that don&#x27;t support unaligned access<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/frankmcsherry/columnar/blob/master/examples/example.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/frankmcsherry/columnar/blob/master/exampl...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/mkaufmann/simple_serialize"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mkaufmann/simple_serialize</a>",1418977351

8771462,comment,8769925,8770596,0,0,yourad_io,,,"FWIW, I can share my anecdotal periodic itching story:<p>Somewhat infrequently (a few times every year, for the past 11 years) I will go into a &quot;mode&quot; where showering/bathing of any kind will invariably be followed by itching afterwards. This lasts anywhere from a few days (no scratching) to a couple of weeks (some scratching). The itch is concentrated on my front body and legs (never face/arms, rarely back). Nothing helps much except not scratching while it runs its course.<p>What I&#x27;ve found interesting is that this doesn&#x27;t manifest during particular stress / downs / whatever. It can be during an awesome holiday in the summer, or over Christmas, or an ordinary work week. But the itching comes after every shower, as if my body picks up some irritant from the water that doesn&#x27;t affect my hands/face at all. It also isn&#x27;t &quot;something in the water where I live&quot;, as this has manifested in various parts of the UK and Greece.<p>On a scale of 0 to 10, I&#x27;m at 2 as to how manic I&#x27;ve gone about this: when it manifests, I&#x27;ll start using hypo-allergenic shower stuff, paste myself with moisturising cream and just wait it out. Dermatologists have been the expected/reputed amount of helpful: &quot;sounds like you&#x27;re sensitive to something in the water&quot;, so they gave me a stronger cream, which also didn&#x27;t reduce the itching. What worked most was not picking/scratching, or at least not enough to break skin/cause small wounds, etc. Depending on your &quot;itch tolerance&quot;[1] takes a little bit of mental focus, so I wouldn&#x27;t, say, shower before going to bed, but showering and going out was easy.[2] Then, a few days later, I shower -> all good.<p>I guess my point is, while mine could also be somewhat psychologically induced, I don&#x27;t think this is the case. Something seems to trigger an &quot;itch flare&quot; which (a) isn&#x27;t linked to my mood or stress levels, (b) always goes away if I can &quot;forcefully&quot; ignore the urge to scratch and (c) is somehow water related, but not to a particular water source. I feel like If I gave in to the scratching urges, it would be a whole different kind of rabbit hole. So my issue doesn&#x27;t really compare in the least with what these folks are going through - just a periodic experience of a similar thing at a lower intensity level. You can&#x27;t always &quot;push aside&quot; pain, so it stands to reason that you can&#x27;t always &quot;push aside&quot; the scratching urge, and that&#x27;s when it takes up a life of its own. I am very grateful for not having to deal with this full-time. Not scratching while itching can be proper work, depending on the intensity/duration of the itching spell(s).<p>As for what mine is, I have no clue, and as long as we stay on our current terms, I&#x27;m somewhat content with that. Allergies and sensitivities can be pretty hard to pin down.<p>PS: Another reason I don&#x27;t think my itching is psychological - I just read the article, then wrote this, and I&#x27;m not itching - yet ;)<p>[1] if &quot;pain tolerance&quot; is a thing, and itching has its own receptors and all, ...<p>[2] Except once in a while, in public/with friends/with people anyhow, the itch will &quot;win&quot; and I&#x27;ll forget that I shouldn&#x27;t do my instead-of-itching-last-measure, which is to hit/punch the itching spot rather than scratch (my hand is already moving of its own accord, so something needs to happen). Not a masochist in the least, but rather I&#x27;ve noticed that the little physical pain takes away the edge of the itching. YMMV, not offering this as advice. However, you do, you may want to avoid doing that in public, or at least don&#x27;t follow up any questions with a grunt like &quot;it was that or flaying myself with this steak knife&quot;, or you may stop being invited to dinner parties.",1418976858

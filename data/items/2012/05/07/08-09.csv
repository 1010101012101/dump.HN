Though its powerful and how can we say almighty, it still holds some drawbacks like lack of voiceover function. Many users in Yahoo Answer will ask the similar questions Where can i record my voice and insert to WLMM? (for some green hands of course)or Where is the voiceover button? (for some experienced users most of time). Actually if you tried all the functions of WLMM, you will figure out that there is no such kind of function, but you can make webcam record do if you dont mind to show your face in your video. Another option can be picked up, if you insist to use this software, you can try to record your voice via microphone with other record software and save it in your pc in advance and then insert it to your windows movie maker. Done! But the live experience should be much inferior to others.<p>Leave the drawbacks of windows movie maker, the function of posting in YouTube and other social websites should be one of the shinny parts. In my opinion, there is over 40% users being enamoured of WLMM due to this powerful reason. However, because of some limitations to input and output formats and some sophisticated operating steps, especially for some greenhands, this YouTube Movie Maker cant meet needs to some extent.

There was a designer from Expo, a primary contractor and subcontractors for tiling, painting, etc. a project workbook containing all the documents, including the design, and a logbook for every contractor to record their visit. But it turned out to be just like a software project.<p>As soon as they started ripping up the walls, the painstakingly drawn design for the tub/shower was hastily and arbitrarily adjusted because the casing for an outside fire extinguisher was in the way. Many of the components turned out to be incompatible with each other and many were not the ones originally ordered (the bathtub was not even the one labelled on its box!)<p>Communication was terrible  the city inspector would tell the primary contractor to change something, and then a subcontractor would show up and ask me what he was supposed to do. When there was a disagreement about whether the tiling was done properly, one of the contractors disfigured the tiling to force another contractor to redo it. They all had other projects, so for long stretches I had a pile of dirt (for the cement) in my patio and a non-functioning bathroom for months. And toward the end there were some quick patches, e.g. the walls were slightly curved so edges of the tiles looked bad and they just painted the patches, which worked but cost me extra. And a couple of years later when the tub sprung a leak, the plumber couldnt figure out how to get in there, said they must have done a shoddy job on connecting the pipes, then when he finally got a good look at it, realized why they did it that way. It was exactly like a software project!""",1336380138

One of the biggest software companies ever, having ethical/legal/policy decisions made by the coder-on-the-spot (at least if you believe Google's representations on the topic). Or Apple with Lion debug-logging clear text passwords for FileVault, and having it escape ""into the wild"".<p>The ""architect"" and the ""civil engineer"" and the ""structural engineer"" who have important roles in the world of building physical things, the guys who sign off on bridges or tunnels or even just-repaired airliners, the guys who put their careers on the line when they sign the paperwork, the guys with qualifications and certifications and often indemnity insurance to satisfy society that they understand the risks - for the vast majority of software/websites discussed here that's reasonably likely to be a 22year old college dropout aiming to be ""the next Zuck"". Even in small and medium enterprise sized businesses, those roles are largely thrust upon whichever developer seems to be good (and doesn't duck their head quickly enough). And if the shit hits the fan, they say ""sorry boss, it seemed like the right answer at the time"" (and hopefully doesn't get hung out in the press like it seems Milner has been) (And the ""big consulting companies"" mentioned in the post I'm responding too, in my limited experience they often seem to want to make all the architectural/engineering/policy/ethical/legal decisions, then leave with their paycheck before the ""codemonkeys"" implement it all, and not be contactable when their ""solutions"" turn out to be incomplete/contradictory/impossible)<p>I _hope_ government regulation of ""software construction"" isn't the answer (at least not for software that'll just cost investors money when it fails, as opposed to bridges or airliners that'll kill people), but I think lines of responsibility and authority need to be more explicitly identified in many software projects, with appropriate authority conferred on the people burdened with the responsibility. Holding developers to deadlines without giving them the authority to adjudicate on them or be involved in the determination of them, is a startlingly common way to have your developers cut corners - and worse, feel entirely justified in cutting corners and convincing themselves they're ""doing the right thing"".",1336380072

Physical things ""play nice"" together because they are part of the physical world. Materials have characteristics that are inherent and don't need to be conceived of where as the way things behave and interact in software needs to be defined and constructed entirely by humans.<p>I guess one could argue that happens to a certain extent in the world of materials science but ... I don't really think it holds up.<p>I arrived at a point where I started to think of building software as writing a novel. Once you start to use that as an analogy, it doesn't seem so weird that it's hard and takes ages, because so does writing a novel.<p>In a novel, one must define the entire world, and one can make the choice of using/re-using story lines or doing something original.

But I don't think it's ever really going to happen, because one of two things will happen. One is that you'll run into a set of requirements that no one has run into before, not because any of the requirements is unusual but because the space of possible requirements is very big if not infinite in size, and once you combine requirements that space increases exponentially. The other is that you'll run into a requirement that's simpler to implement directly than it is to write the glue code for all the components you <i>could</i> use to solve it.

3938139,comment,3937871,3937871,25,0,bigiain,,,"My opinion?<p>Because as much as the software industry loves to adopt the work ""engineer"", almost none of the sort of websites and software discussed here on HN ever gets anything much like ""engineering"" in the sense of, say, ""civil engineering"" done.<p>I think in my ~20year career, I've had only 3 projects that were specified well enough up front that we just ""built it according to the plans"" and had a satisfied customer at the end. Overwhelmingy, some (or most) of the design gets ""made up as we go along"". Even on projects with several small forests worth of up-front documentation, there's almost always large areas of vagueness or outright contradictory requirements, which need decision making on the developers part halfway into the job.<p>There are _very_ few websites that couldn't be coded from the ground up in a few weeks with a few good programmers - _IF_ you had already thought through all of the things the site needs and all of the consequences and the contradictions in those consequences. Even the big ugly complex projects, like Google's search or Facebook or Wikipedia or Twitter - if you had a spec that answered all the details about how you wanted them, a small team of experienced web guys could get it up and running in a month or so, and let you now how much cloud/hardware/sysadmin/support you'd need to budget for as your customer acquisition kicked in.<p>It doesn't take very long to ""build"" the software or the website (obvious ""large scale"" projects like OSes excepted). What takes most of the time is identifying and solving the problem. (And, I suspect a lot of the reason software/websites have a reputation for taking ""so long"" is that they're _way_ too often rushed into the ""building"" phase way before all the things that need designing are even identified, then all the new solutions take longer 'cause we try to fit them around all the work that's already been done.)",1336378061

Some people might not forward you an invite to some event, but they are really not friends if they choose to do this. Writing a short email is not a big time investment.

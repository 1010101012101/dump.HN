282336,comment,282095,282178,0,0,indiejade,,,"Hmm. I'm not generally a fan of profanity-spewing in speech.  However, I would agree w/David in that it can be an effective tool, but would add the disclaimer of <i>occasionally;</i> it's effective if it's used rarely enough to garner an actual response from the intended audience.  As per his example of speaking at conferences.  Most of the time, however, a person is known as either someone who constantly spews profanities or someone who doesn't.  People who are the latter lose their shock factor quickly.<p>Writing, on the other hand, rarely calls for it . . . except in contexts like fictional writing where it can be used to paint a character, usually someone with a low IQ.<p>And it's not very effective in non-fiction writing / blogging, but for the rare instances it's meant to be funny.  If I'm writing some fuming diatribe, typing just to ""let off steam,"" or whatever, I've found that it is much more effective (and satisfying) to craft perfectly-reasoned logical sentences about the reason(s) I'm pissed off without the repeated use of four-letter words.<p>edits:  <i>indie also has a difficult time crafting logical or gramatickally-correct sentences when tired  ;) </i>",1219294155

282326,comment,281676,281676,0,0,gtani,,,"#2: Sorry i consider this moot:<p>- the docs for tsearch are dense, not terribly friendly, and acts_as_tsearch appears to be under documented and possibly not maintained/updated.  So if tsearch has any deal winners over sphinx and solr (for me, key ones would be custom tokenizers/stemmers, UTF-8, column weights, indexing short words and acronyms, faceted search, indexing instance methods and has_many child records along with what's in parent record) they're not readily apparent.  Granted i only tried to understand tsearch for ~20 minutes)
and a_a_tsearch did well in benchmarks, see comments: (teh tsearch count for ""god"" in index by book does indicate a possibly serious problem)<p><a href=""http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2008/03/17/rails-search-benchmarks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2008/03/17/rails-search-...</a><p>- The four leading search plugins: acts_as_[ferret, solr],ultrasphinx , thinkng sphinx work equally well with MySQL, and postgres, as far as i know.  They're all pretty painless installs, if not terribly fast to build indexes, in the case of ferret and solr",1219293006

282320,comment,282234,282313,0,0,sown,,,"I think one way that dignity is essential is that we all have secrets and all humans have a strong desire to keep them that way. It breaks a person down to not have it. An example might be during boot camp where there are few secrets and humiliation and lack of privacy are used to break a recruit.<p>For example, in some churches, a list of the highest and lowest tithes from parishioner. Of course, the goal is obvious: to humiliate and subject people. Of course you don't have to go to that particular church but if one is devout and that church is the only local representation of your particular denomination you can see how that would be ...undignified.<p>I could go on.

In addition to portraying certain people (notably Yau) in a rather negative light, the entire mathematics community is depicted as petty and argumentative. As such, the article is not taken seriously in much of the math community. People have their flaws, of course, but things have been taken to rather an extreme in this article.",1219292376

I'm pretty sure every kid would think they were guaranteed a win, and I could see the process becoming somewhat addicting. Plus, who doesn't want a shot at something free?",1219291573
282313,comment,282234,282234,0,0,mike_organon,,,"I often like Schneier, but his arguments are weak in this article.<p>""My problem with quips like these -- as right as they are -- is that they accept the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong. It's not. Privacy is an inherent human right, and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect.""<p>I do agree with Schneier's examples and reasons of the importance of privacy, and I agree that the point is not about hiding a wrong.<p>In addition to ""an inherent human right"" it's also ""a basic human need,"" he says.  I would say that the right to life (including property) is fundamental, and privacy of different things is something one can choose to protect or not depending on the issue.  Most people don't care about phone number and address being public; they don't cover their faces walking around town; they don't care that grocery stores and credit cards track purchases.  Privacy as an extension of life and property makes more sense.  You protect it where it's important.<p>I don't see that he argued any points about dignity and respect being essential to his point - I think those are just some of the reasons you want to keep some things private, not essentials.",1219291390

(The Mac version gets bad reviews, and it's different from the Windows version.) I have to boot Windows XP in a VM to use the damned thing. I'm embarrassed to tell you how many months behind I am in my data entry.<p>The reason I'm not broke is that I don't use Quickbooks for invoicing. There are several good solutions for online invoicing. I use Harvest and I think they're great. No P.O.s, though.<p>The thing that sold Quickbooks to me is the existence of lots of <i>Dummies</i>-style docs -- you are hardly alone in your pain when you're a Quickbooks user -- and the fact that my accountant accepts the files, which is the real killer feature.<p>I'm still stuck in Gnucash for my personal finances, but I didn't consider using that for the business. I have little faith in my accountant's ability to make sense of Gnucash's files, I'm not confident that it has the features I need, and I can't seem to get it running easily on the Mac. The damned thing seems to be linked against every single library in Linux.",1219291274

Here is my guess.<p>1. Given a city model, it can be rendered according to camera location, orientation.<p>2. If users are only allow to walk on the street. Which reduce the possible rendering camera position and possible orientations.<p>3. If user can only move in fixed speed.<p>4. Given 1, 2, 3. The possible camera positions, orientations are limited.<p>5. The render farm render all possible scenes in system. They are marked by positions, camera orientation.<p>6. Assemble all rendering scenes according to users' camera position, orientation and pace and stream the whole scene out.<p>7. We can add one more parameter, time of the scene. So a city can have 24 hours and the change of Sun, Moon.<p>So the problem is reduced to how to assemble those scene fast enough and streaming them. And because it will be a movie, so one important thing is to find the difference between two scene and compress them quickly.<p>If they want to add users' avatars, the avatars may not need to be ray-traced. But just a object overlay in the scene.",1219291227

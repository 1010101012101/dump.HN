36270,comment,36139,36139,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"Anecdotes prove nothing.<p>I know a few writers and I know a few entrepreneurs. The writers read their whole lives. The entrepreneurs I know never read all that much. I know a businessman who will only read books if they're bestsellers. I've even met entrepreneurs who have never voluntarily read a book. As far as I can tell, the guys who devote time to reading will never do as well as the guys to devote time to making money.",1185248633

When ads come from legitimate businesses providing products/services that are actually valuable, I think it's a wonderful thing that it's getting a lot easier to reach people who need them.",1185247092

36265,comment,36152,36227,0,0,vegashacker,,,"I may be a minority, but that's not how I buy stuff if I know what I want to buy.  If I know what I want to buy, then I research the item using Google.<p>I don't click on ads often, but when I do, it's usually because something caught my attention that I wasn't directly searching for.<p>The one exception is that I occasionally try to ""trigger"" ads that give me a discount once I know exactly what I want.",1185246420

36263,comment,36152,36181,0,0,vegashacker,,,"That's a really good point about the click/no-click.  That said, I could see myself down-voting ads for which there's no chance I'd ever click, leaving ads I might be interested in at some point, but didn't actually want to click at that moment.<p>Also, there's the type of ad where you think you might be interested in it, so you click it to see what it's about, only to find that the product or whatever actually sucks.  That's where the down-vote would help.<p>I don't know if this idea will work, though.  Assuming it's used by web surfers, then I think advertisers will want it.  But that's a big assumption.  What's the incentive for web surfers to use it?  Looking at ads, even ""high-quality"" ones, isn't really a priority of mine.  And there are other tools like StumbleUpon or del.icio.us that suggest content to me, but don't really have the commercial agenda that an ad does.",1185246024

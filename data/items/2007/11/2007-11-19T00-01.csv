Getting in the zone is just a matter of time for me. Spending 20 minutes on something means I should be able to get a good few hours.<p>The biggest barrier to this is the ""i'll start right after [X]"". Go the the bathroom, chat with someone about an idea, get a cup of coffee, check my mail, comment on a news article, write a blog post about a cool dancing robot, submit a time card, get a long lunch, go to a neighboring cube to get a piece of candy, get a glass of water, check on my finances, etc.<p>People fill days doing junk like this. Even if interleaved with real work, the lack of focus prevents the coveted ""zone"". Identify and eliminate everything besides work that you're doing when you should be in a long stretch of work.",1195433358

81355,story,,,9,10,wastedbrains,"Hacker New UI issue with comment voting",,"I accidentally voted up on a comment I meant to vote down, then voting disappeared and I don't have a way to correct the problem. Could the voting links just fade a bit allowing you to change votes? Or a user thread that shows all votes a user has made with the ability to change your mind. That could also be useful if someone convinces you of a new point of view.",1195432591
81354,comment,81203,81203,0,0,nkohari,,,"I think it really depends. Most of the applications that currently exist on Facebook are defined by Facebook itself. That is to say, the applications add to the features of Facebook, rather than Facebook adding to the application. I think that soon, we will start seeing sites rely on Facebook's API to drive the social infrastructure of their site. In this way, the site would be self-sufficient, but could take advantage of Facebook's platform to add value to their own offering.<p>I'll bet dollars to donuts that the applications that receive grants from the fbFund will be of this ilk rather than a SuperMegaUltraPoke or Vampires and Pirate Ninjas application. At least, I hope so. If not, Facebook apps will never mature, and will be the flash in the pan that many think they will.",1195432131

Except that nobody will have ever heard of the people we thank.<p>Of course, you could just send copies unbidden to people anyway.  Hmm.<p>Thanks to Al Gore, Donald Knuth, Warren Buffett and Sergei Brin for reading early drafts of this comment.",1195432072

81351,story,,,12,21,hbien,"Ask YC: Is distributing your source code a stupid idea?",,"A lot of web apps these days are hosted, but there are  still some that are licensed (haveamint.com, fogbugz, warehouseapp.com).<p>I'm thinking about making an app to sell cheap, $30, but should the source code be included with it?  The application is meant for anyone with a shared hosting account or VPS, so the source code might be useful for hackers who want to change things for their own needs.<p>But at the same time, giving away the source code feels like you're giving away your hard work.<p>What do you guys think?",1195430951

Yeah, React has <i>relatively</i> high performance—at least when compared to a sluggish framework like Angular when writing those large apps, but that&#x27;s not even the core selling point (as far as I&#x27;m concerned).

Instead, this guy tested the raw performance of some very simple code compared the sort of vanilla code you&#x27;d never ever ever write in the sort of app that React (or Angular) is actually designed to help with.

The idea is that everyone is anonymous and the types of people who you seem to like, based on factors like leaving your cursor over their comment for a while, are slowly deanonymized to you. The way browser fingerprinting would work in this scenario is that instead of storing usernames attached to models, we store a few different indicators (like browser fingerprints) and create probabilistic models relating these indicators to the aforementioned models. That way even if we have a completely new user we can create a new initial model for them based on what they might like. I have only just started working on this idea though, so I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work in practice and I&#x27;m not sure what other indicators I might use.<p>With this in mind I don&#x27;t think there would be a reason to spin up VMs and create new &#x27;accounts&#x27; because it would just limit your personal experience.",1435978018

That&#x27;s not a theory, that&#x27;s what the data says; and it&#x27;s not controversial data - all they have to do is look at your income tax records and then your parents to see if you&#x27;ve escaped poverty.<p>You make an argument about the amount of regulation, the disincentivizing force of taxes, the lack of investment, the difficulty in starting new companies.  Sure, I can see how that makes sense as a concept.  But the concept is clearly flawed, because if you look at the black and white numbers (as opposed to what you&#x27;ve observed anecdotally) it doesn&#x27;t reflect what&#x27;s actually happened on the ground.<p>Despite the high taxes, despite all of the companies that are apparently fleeing the country, despite all of the regulations, poor Swedes with gumption and drive actually have a better chance at escaping poverty than poor Americans.<p>There&#x27;s any number of theories about why that is: it&#x27;s easier to take chances on starting a company when you know you&#x27;re not risking homelessness when you fail; very low cost higher education is actually helpful in improving your lot in life; having high quality nutrition and primary education regardless of your parent&#x27;s income helps poor children do better, etc.  But those are just theories - who knows if they&#x27;re right?  They&#x27;re just possible explanations for how things got to be the way they are.<p>Bottom line is that Sweden (and many other leftist countries) are doing well at making sure the average person living there is being rewarded according to who <i>they</i> are and not who their parents are.  The US, though it has many impressive qualities, and though people talk a lot about hard work being rewarded, isn&#x27;t doing as well.<p>In terms of your link about immigration, &quot;tens of people&quot; rioting is not the kind of numbers that people should look at when deciding policy.

JS is obviously not fast by its nature; the only reason it&#x27;s fast sometimes is because modern JS engines do incredible optimizations behind the scenes. As such, for real-world performance, writing code that the engine understands how to optimize <i>entirely dwarfs</i> trivia like how Babel transpiled your default parameters. (Even the most microbenchmarked function will run dog-slow if the v8 optimizer bails out.) And if real-world performance is dominated by optimizability, then it follows that microbenchmarks are largely useless unless they happen to get optimized/deoptimized in the same way that your code does.<p>Incidentally for v8 at least, currently using <i>any</i> ES6 feature (even a single &quot;const&quot; that&#x27;s never used) causes the optimizer to bail out. So any question of &quot;ES6-induced bottlenecks&quot; is beside the point - it doesn&#x27;t matter how fast the ES6 feature is if its mere presence slows down everything else.",1435977776

This creates a market for service competitors, and if they&#x27;re willing to make smaller margins, can pay your people, the people you have in <i>your</i> company doing service work more.<p>For example, how many people who don&#x27;t work for Red Hat offer Red Hat support services?<p>> The valid business strategy is nobody will trust you if you aren&#x27;t open source these days.<p>I don&#x27;t really disagree. Which is why you need to have a strategy that lets you check the &quot;is open source&quot; box with a buyer, while still protecting your business advantage.",1435975602

I took a look at your GitHub and had a few thoughts:<p>1) Add a real readme to your projects. If you don&#x27;t have any shipped work, that&#x27;s ok, but you do have side projects I can take a look at. Help me out though, I want some information on what this app should do and I don&#x27;t want to go diving into your code without that background.<p>The first repo I visited was cupcakes, because, well who doesn&#x27;t love cupcakes? But I was disappointed when I didn&#x27;t see any real information about what this app was aiming to do.<p>2) You should be able to get a Jr. level position for at least 70k, so don&#x27;t sell yourself short. Now if you have a lot to learn, be willing to take less and get your foot in the door.<p>3) Focus on one language that interests you. I don&#x27;t hire generalists. I look for developers who have spent the time to learn a language, not six. You can always learn more later, but you&#x27;ll have an easier time if you can pitch on the language or area you know really well.<p>Other than that, keep applying to jobs, keep growing, you&#x27;ll land something. Good luck!",1435975555

9828840,comment,9828644,9828644,0,0,kordless,,,"The simple solution to this problem is to enable a new type of sales model for software. The current models are broken and lean toward the investor-founder-operations-developer chain of control, with the investor and founders controlling the revenue. Flipping the model on its head would allow for the revenue to flow directly to the developers, bypassing the chain. I think I may have a solution for this, but it&#x27;s going to require some infrastructure changes.",1435975532

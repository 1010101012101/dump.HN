It is the inclusion of everything and the kitchen sink in the standard library which discouraged the development of a healthy third party library community. Contrast with Perl and Ruby where there are third party libraries for virtually everything despite them being less popular languages.<p>2) filter.default is not a correct solution. You should escape output, not input. Escaping input 1) results in crap data in your database 2) opens you up for user input sources you forgot about. What if for example you have another application working against the same database? One which is not web based?<p>The existence of filter.default is an example of the very problem with PHP.

4981929,comment,4979938,4981573,8,0,miked,,,"As for Mao's great medical advances, I've actually been in a number of medical facilities in China. My wife survived and later became a physician at the second best hospital in Beijing (and presumably one of the best in the country). This was the hospital where the mid-level communist party members go for treatment (no proletarians need apply). All I can say is: Holy crap! I've also been to a medical clinic in the village where my wife's family is from. My advice to travelers: don't get sick in China. Get sick in Taiwan or Hong Kong.<p>Stalin (who would know) once said that one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. When my wife tells me about her childhood (she only does this when I ask about it) it's the little details that chill me, not the ""statistics"" of her life. Here's a few:<p>She and her friends used to want a taste of sweetness so much (the Great Helmsman apparently considered candy a bourgeois excess) that they used to pull the bodies of honeybees apart and suck on them to get at the nectar. (This from a woman who today loves animals more than anyone I know.)<p>When my wife was in grade school she got so hungry one day that she snuck off into a field near her school and dug up a single sweet potato and ate it raw. She was caught and, for this horrendous crime, her principle put her on limited rations (and she was already hungry all the time) for an indefinite period. She became weaker and weaker as the months went by. Finally, after six months of this constant hunger, one of her teachers became alarmed at her state and went to the principle and asked to have her rations restored to her previous (limited) status. The principle's response? ""Oh, I had forgotten she was still on limited rations. I only meant for that to last a month. Yes, restore her food quota."" This was the little girl who is now my wife.",1356785225

Read up about unit testing, continuos integration and continuous delivery.<p>* Build, build and build. No amount of reading will help you tackle some of the issues that real-world data will throw at you. An active Github account also serves as a validation that you are actually capable of ""shipping things"".<p>* Breadth is important, but continue to focus on becoming great at atleast one thing.<p>* Learn a few languages. Pick one or two which are statically typed (Scala, Haskell), one or two that are dynamically typed (Python, Ruby). I also highly recommend Erlang which was a revelation for me.<p>* Master Git (or Mercurial, if that's your thing).<p>* Choose to work in companies where you feel you will be surrounded by people smarter than you. This is possible even outside the Googles and Facebooks of the world.<p>* Don't get overly attached to your tools. Languages, frameworks and editors are a means to an end. Be open to new ideas and better way of doing things. There is an initial learning curve before you start becoming truly productive in anything and so be mindful of that before you dismiss something.<p>* Lastly, don't get burned out.",1356783450

Both message-passing and immutability pay a price for performance in ways that matter for real-world problems.<p>Example 1: Algorithms that operate on large matrices. Immutability means (1) that you can't have destructive updates of small parts, but need to copy the matrix in its entirety, and (2) that you can't have in-place operations, increasing your memory usage (and thus decreasing L2 cache performance).<p>Example 2: Caching expensive operations. You want to share these among as many threads as possible to maximize hit rates, but you also need to avoid serialization bottlenecks.  This is incompatible with both pure message passing and, say, the standard implementations for immutable maps.",1356782913

He is not in a position to advise the government to break the law. No economist is, for the very reason that Economic analysis pre-supposed the rule of law. If you throw out ""obeying the law"" you throw out the field of Economics, generally speaking.<p>Second, there is the empirical fact the the US debt is subject to being held by insitutions that are constrained by law as to holding only certain classes of securities.  Your pension fund cannot hold XXX rated t-secs if they are below investment grade thresholds.  So, the who would hold 17trillion of US debt after a default?  Talk about too big to fail...<p>And furthermore, there are stronger constraints on policy set in in the constitution that prevent 'interference with contract' which generally speaking includes financial contracts.  It is not the case that the government can dis-regard the Constitution and appropriate value through cynical public policy.<p>And just as a general point, now that you've sunken to this desperate level, take a look around at the company you are keeping? Seriously. The rule of law trumps economics. Full stop. (Ask the 2009 nobel prize winners).<p>Lastly, taxes as an ""asset class"" if you want to condier them that are a ""derivative"" of corporate and personal earnings (at first approximation). The are, like any derivative, dependant on the value of the underlying assets. They are therefore subject to the same constraints--ie, unless corporate earnings are infiinite, taxes-as-dervatives cannot be infiinte through logic/math.<p>This is all unimpressive rubbish that you put forth here.  The reason I didn;t walk through all of this before is it is a waste of time even giving Krugman the attention.",1356782858

4981872,comment,4980735,4980735,2,0,morphle,,,"The version control in Squeak, based on Smalltalk-80, has been in use for over 16 years, probably even 32 years. The community of Squeak has been entirely happy with it, it could perhaps be made even more convenient with more diff analysis tools. For every snippet, even a single line in a method, all the versions are kept around and the blame for the revisions to a previous version, including deletions, is always clear. The last version is active (there is no compiling fase in smalltalk, only auto compile for adaptive compilation). So your question is never relevant unless one wants to merge back after a fork. In that case diff tools should give a human the entire history, diffs and all its dependancies that are affected to see what happend when and how. It is indeed useful to see changes going back 40 years. In the case auto-merge-back is possible, the S unit test runner must check if it worked, but such a situation occurs only once in 10 years if at all. So to me there is not much to be desired in a version control system than the current method version control of Squeak.",1356782846

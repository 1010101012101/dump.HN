Merrill Lynchs Hogan says, I had a client come in and say that he bought a Tesla car  but he had also bought shares in the company. And he told us that he made enough profit on the shares to cover the cost of the car.<p>So if I buy a 100K car and invest in the company, then that&#x27;s smart? Otherwise, it&#x27;s considered &quot;conspicuous&quot;?? If you drop 100K on a car, it doesn&#x27;t matter how you bought it, it&#x27;s still a 100K purchase on a car.",1375757941

I recently discovered a PHP class (s3.class.php) that helps store, retrieve and delete files on S3.<p>However, the class does not work well in a few cases. Therefore I thought I'll learn REST so that I can create my own PHP class for interacting with S3 servers.<p>Does anyone know of a good introduction/tutorial for REST with php examples? I found a good tutorial but it was based on Ruby. \nThanks",1207612351

It's just not very reliable, when compared to the best hosts in the business--while EC2 downtime per year can be measured in hours, the best hosts are down minutes or seconds each year (of course, your apps and your system administration abilities can easily make up the difference--we've been offline a couple of times due to Joomla problems, and there's nothing a more reliable network or server could do about it).  But, every bit of downtime adds up...and maybe your next big customer or investor was looking at your site at that very moment.",1207611657

157297,comment,156863,156872,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"Whenever I see a story like this I wish the United States would provide students a far more flexible and natural learning curriculum. For example, the ""mathematics"" course trek in the US school system alone is one of the most dreadful:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=130499"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=130499</a><p>The problem lies in several issues. As one of ""those kids"" that started college at 11, one issue I have recognized to be by far the strongest is the self-perpetuation of incompetence: high school teachers are usually direly incapable of providing students with the actual modern perspective on the subject they are teaching! Qualification wise, I could have been teaching high school classes three years ago, and I knew a lot of education majors back in my undergraduate days. Usually, it's the people that aren't smart enough to pursue the subject that they simply make do with teaching it instead. Most of the brighter math and physics majors I knew went on to graduate school or a scientific profession; the others usually minored in education. Perhaps it is an unfair generalization, but it does seem to be true from my experiences. Of course, you can all draw the implications that would have on the K-12 education system. To illustrate with a final example, some of the math major / education minor people told me ""I hate proofs""! I thought I would cry.<p>I didn't mean to make this my life's story, but in any case, perhaps it could be argued the current quagmire that is our method of ensuring child ""development"" is in some way good, simply due to its inherent selectivity. Perhaps the innovative and intelligent and resourceful will escape the K-12 system much like Dmitri did. It's largely luck, though, as it heavily depends on their environment (parents, town, etc.). I considered undergrad to be like my high school. Although I skipped the latter, undergrad was fairly similar in structure (homework, participation, tests, etc.), except that the classes were taught by people who actually knew what they were talking about.<p>On a final note, what Dmitri or I or the 12-year-old Asian kids (sorry for the stereotype) ""do"" is not being ""super intelligent."" It's merely being lucky or fortuitous enough to see the light in a (imho) broken system. Really, when you think of it, nearly everything in an undergraduate curriculum is quite simple if you just read the damn textbooks and do your homework, and in the case of people like Dmitri, be a hacker and play around. In a perfect education schema, every kid would be like that. Every kid would be creative; not shackled and restrained.",1207610735

It's only by explicitly defining a <i>lack of</i> one of these that you would hit an error (as he did in his examples). As in, your basic class would be fine, and then as you added special constructors without adding the basic ones, you'd make trouble for yourself. Note that he has to explicitly declare the copy constructor private to break things...<p>Then again, I was never really that far into C++ land, so I wouldn't be surprised if I were wrong.",1207610059

1906958,comment,1906444,1906444,0,0,Construct,,,"I always wonder if bills like this one which radically alter the structure of our government are proposed in seriousness or merely as a distraction to please certain voters.<p>Obviously, adding a 1% tax on all financial transactions, as this bill proposes, would drastically change how our economy operates. Keeping the markets efficient and accurately priced becomes much more difficult when any trade comes with a 1% cost. Especially when the 1% is imposed whether it results in a profit or a loss. From what I see in this bill, even selling one stock to purchase another would incur a 1% fee on the first sale and a 1% fee on the purchase of the second stock.<p>1% may not sound like much, but as money continues to change hands the government's take grows significantly. Let $100 change hands 10 times, and you're left with $90.44 of the original money. Let $100 change hands 100 times and you're down to $36.60.<p>Of course this scheme would transfer money to the government to pay down our debt (in theory, if the money is used as the bill intends), but at what cost? This additional financial friction could seriously slow down the economy and disrupt efficient market pricing. Finding the proper balance of taxes, debt, and economy growth is a very, very difficult problem, and this solution is not well thought out at all. Furthermore, eliminating our national debt is not going to solve all of our problems, as many would like us to believe.<p>Throwing ridiculous bills like this in the mix only serves to muddy the waters. It distract us from the real problems and the potentially viable solutions. Let's make small, incremental changes within our current tax structure to fix our problems in a reasonable manner.",1289840350

Other proposed sales taxes to replace the income tax, such as the fair tax, generally only apply to retail sales of new consumer goods.  This would go way beyond that.<p>Write a check to your nephew for his birthday?  1% tax.<p>Buy something used on eBay and pay for it on paypal?  1% tax.<p>Support a project on Kickstarter?  1% tax.<p>Get paid by your employer?  They pay a 1% tax.<p>Sell some shares of stock A in order to buy stock B?  1% tax on the sale and another 1% tax on the purchase.  This one is HUGE: consider how many such transactions occur on Wall Street each day.  Such a tax alone could quite likely destroy the high-speed trading industry.  I'll let smarter people decide whether that's good or bad.<p>Also consider that all of these cascade.  For example: you buy a table and pay a 1% transaction fee.  The store paid a 1% transaction fee when they bought the table from the manufacturer, a 1% transaction fee on the shippers who brought it to the store, and a 1% transaction fee on their rent, utilities, and other overhead.  The manufacturer paid a 1% transaction fee on their raw materials, 1% to have those materials shipped, etc.  I would imagine that this would strongly encourage vertical consolidation in order to avoid these intermediate transaction fees.

They shouldn't take days, but since we don't know how large the events table was we have no way of knowing if a faster restore was possible.  A hot restore which it sounds like what they are doing may take longer by simple fact that it's restoring while the table is in use.<p>And DROPs (or truncates) are almost always used if the goal is to remove all the data in a table like you would want if rebuilding the entire system.

So it's almost certainly Store related.<p>It's interesting that Japan get a clock (no Australia, which is a bigger market). Just last week Japan got the ability to purchase & rent movies, and that this announcement comes so soon after is probably not a coincidence. So something with the store, and something to do with movies.<p>Making this big a deal of an announcement, so close to the holiday season, makes me think that it's also something that is intended to give people a reason to buy Apple hardware.<p>Side note: Back when AppleTV2 was unveiled, Jobs said that you would be able to rent movies ""day and date"" with DVD releases. That hasn't been true to this point - embarrassingly Iron Man 2 which he demonstrated on stage wasn't available for rental until the DVD had been out for some time.<p>So I'm going to go with better movie rentals - earlier availability (perhaps much earlier, for a premium), possibly bundled movies, possibly the removal of the stupid contractual stuff where some movies become unrentable due to TV deals and hampers the library.<p>I'm sure Apple would love to give lots of families a reason to buy themselves an Apple TV's for Christmas this year, particularly with Boxee/Google now pushing into that market.",1289838412

She reached from behind in the middle of my buttocks towards my vagina area.""<p>""She then felt my inner thighs and my vagina area, touching both of my labia.""<p>If it's through clothing then it really sounds like nothing more than a thorough security search that I've experienced many times just to get into a night club.  The person patting me down didn't tell me she was going to touch my testicles, but a portion of her hand did touch my testicles, through clothing mind you.  Or to write in the above fashion:<p>""She wrapped her arms around my torso and felt up and down my back, then she bent at the knees so that her face was in very close proximity to my penis and put her hands on my buttocks, squeezing them and moving them up and down.""<p>""She then moved her hands around to the front and inside of my thighs, touching each of my testicles.""<p>The way it is written, and the fact that this woman feels so violated, I imagined this was all going on under the clothes.  I don't see how a standard through clothing pat down could be traumatic, but I guess everybody has a different threshold for acceptable behaviour.  I have to admit it is a bit jarring to have your sensitive bits jarred by a stranger, but this is not sexual assault given the context.<p>She was told she was going to be searched, and she was searched.  There's no need to have disclosure about every specific part of your body that is going to be touched when you consent to a search.  Yes, a hand my briefly come in contact with your labia through your clothing.  That should be understood by most adults with common knowledge and experience.<p>If this woman truly feels violated in the same way that a sexual assult victim does, then I think her sensitivity threshold is abnormal.  That's not her fault, nor is it anybody else's to be held accountable for.",1289837416

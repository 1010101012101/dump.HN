7646466,comment,7645182,7645341,7,0,rayiner,,,"First, the lawyers don&#x27;t get to decide whether to settle, the lead plaintiffs do. Second, class members can opt-out of the settlement. As &#x27;danielweber points out, nobody will do so because litigating against employers would be a huge black mark on their resume. That&#x27;s the real kicker here.<p>As a general principle, I have serious concerns about the agency problems that exist in the class action system as currently structured. I think it&#x27;s way too common for lead plaintiffs to settle for too little. However, in this case I think they and their lawyers did everyone a favor. Nobody would&#x27;ve pursued these cases individually, not even if they stood to get $30k. Every dollar the class plaintiffs recover above $0 is gravy.",1398434355

If it&#x27;s something simple, then TDD is also not a problem, but at that point I&#x27;m really wasting my time.<p>TDD stunts design, thinking, and refinement ability, and only works when there is nothing left but execution. In my mind, as long as the tests get written (and obviously makes sense to write them at around the time the function/method/class is written), then I&#x27;m alright. Also, I usually don&#x27;t know what a class will look like until I&#x27;ve written it, used it for a little bit, tested it manually, etc. If I were to write a test for it prior to this, then I&#x27;d be wasting time.

Somehow, sometime during their elementary school years, the culture formed by the students of that year in that village had to come to include bullying that girl.

7646423,comment,7644004,7644872,3,0,giovannibajo1,,,"Well, that would be cheating, and Comcast would refuse to be cheated. But let&#x27;s talk of a hypothetical P2pflix that is a video service with almost balanced up/down packets generated by end users.<p>For p2pflix, such negotiations would be far easier. The reason is that Comcast would <i>need</i> to somehow send those packets into p2pdflix network (they can&#x27;t flat out refuse to deliver them in a net neutrality environment, or people would complain that the Internet is broken) so the alternative would be to pay a carrier that then peers with p2pflix. So instead of both paying their carriers, they might come into an agreement to do a free peering.<p>Peering is exactly that: when network A realizes that it&#x27;s paying carrier C1 too much for traffic going into network B, they call B on the phone and ask for a free peering; network B checks how much they&#x27;re paying carrier C2 to bring traffic into network A, and afterwards agrees to peer for a certain amount (e.g.: 4Gbps). They choose a data center where they both have a presence, setup a router with 4Gbps routing power, and reconfigure their BGP routes. Done, and the bills with their respective carriers go down, and everybody is happy.<p>If there is some disproportion, a paid peering might be negotiated; one of the two network would still be paying, but stil a lot less. Say network A is sending 4Gbps into network B, and network B is sending 6Gbps into network A. They can either free peer for 4Gbps (plus B would balance the extra 2Gbps through a carrier to reach A), or B might agree to pay directly A to have up to 6Gbps of peering, paying only the extra 2Gbps. Even assuming that the price per gig is the same of the carrier (and it&#x27;s usually lower), it&#x27;s still a good deal for both parts.<p>The problems happen with YouTube and Netflix because they don&#x27;t have this negotiation power with ISPs, because they have a very big monodirectional flow of traffic. Let&#x27;s also remember that on top of being monodirectional, the <i>absolute</i> amount of traffic is staggering: together, they make something like 45% of the TOTAL US TRAFFIC.<p>Netflix says that Comcast is letting their peering with Cogent saturate, and that&#x27;s probably true, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Comcast measured that 90% of that peering is being used for Netflix traffic. Otherwise, they wouldn&#x27;t let it saturate because not only they would disrupt Netflix traffic for their users, but also any other website traffic that happens to be delivered through Cogent. (Well actually I guess Comcast doesn&#x27;t really care that much about their quality of service to end users, but you get my point).<p>To me, it&#x27;s not a clear cut. Obviously Netflix is a good and nice company providing a disrupting service we all love, and Comcast is a big bad ISP with monopolistic control on access in most zones and doing big profits with shitty service. So well, it&#x27;s kind of easy to side, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that Comcast&#x27;s requests of being paid directly by Netflix is totally unreasonable, given the way the Internet has always worked up until now.",1398433917

7646334,comment,7645807,7646118,4,0,jerf,,,"I think the problem lies in that we often never tell children this, don&#x27;t support them if they try, and the system in general in its effort to make the problem no longer visible to the authorities (as opposed to actually making it go away) often finds the easiest path is to get the compliant target to shut up about the problem rather than the much harder task of actually fixing it. (They don&#x27;t even realize that they&#x27;re doing this... but when the kid&#x27;s talking to the authorities for the fifth time because the first four didn&#x27;t do anything, and the authorities give off a &quot;this again? jeez&quot;, it&#x27;s not hard to figure out how pointless the meetings are.) Which, as an adult, I now realize they simply don&#x27;t have time for, but I wish they&#x27;d be more up front about it and let kids deal with that, rather than pretend they&#x27;ve got all the solutions, ban you from doing anything effective, then fail to do anything effective themselves.<p>I&#x27;m a male, and my tormentors were male, and I think that makes this a radically different situation than the linked article. But for me, I&#x27;m pretty sure two or three well-placed swings (they probably didn&#x27;t even have to <i>connect</i>) would have made school orders of magnitude more pleasant for me. I wish I hadn&#x27;t been raised with everybody around me telling me how wrong that always is, because in hindsight it would have been a great deal less wrong than what happened to me.<p>So, other parents, I encourage you to take a more nuanced approach than mine did. You certainly don&#x27;t want to encourage violence for everything and sure, <i>start</i> with the proper authorities, but I would encourage you that if that still can&#x27;t fix the problem, stand behind your kid if they need to take a bit of action on their own. And please don&#x27;t teach them complete passivity as the answer to everything. I was lucky in ways I didn&#x27;t even understand at the time, and my personal psychological makeup was mostly able to withstand this and come out with very little scarring. Don&#x27;t count on that for your child. I&#x27;ve observed that it&#x27;s not true of everyone.<p>Incidentally, I submit as evidence the fact that people even here have a hard time agreeing to this idea. Think about it. You&#x27;re asking one person to put up with <i>years</i> of physical and/or psychological abuse to save a small set of bullies, who are by definition being bad actors... what? A bruised nose, once or twice? Bruised egos? What kind of fucked up ethical system have you all subscribed to where a bullied person is <i>obligated</i> to put up with years upon years of inescapable abuse rather than <i>throw a punch</i>? Seriously. Please. Think about that for a moment, and stop valuing years of psychological and/or physical abuse at what appears to be &quot;zero&quot;... you are, and I am dead serious about this, part of the problem if you act that way. Bullying is <i>bad</i>. Really <i>bad</i>. Not just &quot;I say the word bad and pat myself on the back for having Good Think&quot;, but really, really drive-people-to-the-brink-of-suicide-or-beyond <i>bad</i>. Don&#x27;t mouth the words about how bullying it bad, <i>act like it!</i><p>(And again, if something other than violence works, hey, great! It&#x27;s not a good first resort. It&#x27;s not the solution to everything and it isn&#x27;t magic. But don&#x27;t act like it&#x27;s nuclear waste and take it entirely off the table at the cost of <i>years of soul-searing abuse</i>. It&#x27;s a bad situation and there may not be a &quot;perfect solution&quot;, but I find it abhorrent how many people even here would rather see someone put up with epic abuse rather that assert themselves even a little.)",1398433168

Oh, yeah, I started learning how to shoot in 1st grade, and was very good at it, although I&#x27;m not sure if that was clear to others until high school when I was on the rifle team (I certainly never made threats, especially of that nature).<p>The key, of course, is deterrence.  Perhaps it&#x27;s a Southern (USA) thing; I grew up in a culturally Southern area, one parent raised in it, another from the Deep South, although a skewed version of it, Louisiana and Cajun (French settlers who were forced to leave &quot;Arcadia&quot;, a formerly French part of Canada).  So unlike this victim, once a line was crossed, I did care about getting my adversaries hurt, that was the objective after all.  Let it be cost free and you can see what happens.<p>Strange anecdote: one day when I was a senior it did come very very close to serious violence, the closest ever, but the adversary ran into a closed off for that period area where teachers were.  His complaints that I was armed with a dog choker chain around my right fist fell on deaf ears as I silently and casually put it in my pocket.<p>I was later told by a school authority that the school would have done nothing to me if I&#x27;d beaten him up (!).  Back then, at least (1979), I guess it made a difference having a perfect record of good behavior and being college track etc., vs. being a notorious trouble maker and not so bright (come to think of it, pretty much all the other bullies had given up by then).<p>If you can&#x27;t bring yourself to retaliate, and it&#x27;s clear to your adversaries ... don&#x27;t know what to say or advise.

And I also think that it&#x27;s giving up to just assign stuff we don&#x27;t get to &#x27;something we cannot understand or see or ever find but is there and is intelligent on top of all that&#x27;.<p>Also like I mentioned before, I have no clue how AI would clash with the existence of a God or religion. And so I don&#x27;t understand why religious people get so upset about it. There are many things we improved on where we don&#x27;t try to take god&#x27;s place (as I guess that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about) according to religious people; like when we made a wheel, did we better God&#x27;s work or try to out-do His work by showing that wheels are more efficient for a lot of things than legs? I don&#x27;t see the difference with copying or even improving on intelligence. So what that clash is I don&#x27;t know but religious people seem to get downright aggressive when you talk about strong AI which gives me, and many others, even more incentive to just side them with the crazies.<p>I was born in the Dutch bible belt and I was raised with religion in school where I had to learn verses by heart and recite them every day; the people too stupid to learn them (small village with lot of inbred) were punished for not being able to learn them and I was punished for asking questions like didn&#x27;t God create these stupid people too, why punish them for something they cannot do? My aunt used to give me physics books for my birthday written by religious professors; actual physics books with quantum mechanics and string theory. And although I did not believe in god at all from a very early age (mostly because none of the people who tried to push me into christianity wanted to answer any critical questions) and I don&#x27;t and never will understand how someone can believe in most of the the things religion dictates, those books my aunt brought showed not everyone was a crackpot and actually there is no reason (and there isn&#x27;t ffs) why physics, AI, evolution theory would not simply rhyme with religion. They are not mutually exclusive as so many (I cannot find another way of saying it) misguided individuals seem to think especially in the US.

7646161,comment,7642434,7642434,15,0,SonOfLilit,,,"TL;DR Cryptol is an amazing tool for communicating crypto specifications with your peers, for testing crypto implementations and for doing crypto research and formal verification. It has the most amazing and practical use of a SAT solver I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>I&#x27;ve touched it briefly a very long time ago, so don&#x27;t believe me blindly, but this is my impression of what Cryptol is about in practice:<p>* If you&#x27;re publishing a paper on a new cryptographic building block, lets call it AES2, you need to specify it. Instead of using the usual math-oriented pseudo-code or unreadable-to-your-peers C, you can use the Cryptol DSL, which looks familiar to your readers but can be executed and toyed with.<p>* If you&#x27;re implementing AES2 (be it in Cryptol, C, VHDL or assembly language) you can ask the Cryptol runtime to verify it against another implementation (usually a Cryptol implementation taken from the paper on AES2, but you could write your own or use an existing implementation in another supported language). The Cryptol runtime may be able to tell you if they are mathematically identical (and I do mean mathematically: this is not unit testing but proving identity). I say &quot;may&quot; because not every function can be verified this way - that would solve the proven unsolvable Halting Problem. This is implemented by translating the tested implementations to logic circuits and using a SAT solver to prove that their XOR is constant 0. (Please take a moment to reflect on how awesome this is.)<p>* If you&#x27;re researching crypto, it gives you a programming language and toolset very fit for experimenting with cryptographic building blocks and running the sorts of statistical tests that you&#x27;d want to run on them in the process of research. It also gives you tools for formal verification (mathematically proving properties of your AES2 proposal in a way that a computer can verify is error-free).<p>* In theory, you can compile a Cryptol specification to optimized C or VHDL and use that in your project. acfoltzer said in this thread that Cryptol 2 is a rewrite and the compiler still isn&#x27;t done (it was for Cryptol 1).<p>In a sane world, crypto journals and standards institutes would not accept proposals of new crypto building blocks that don&#x27;t come with Cryptol code, and implementations would always use the Cryptol toolset to automatically mathematically verify that their implementation is identical to the published specification, eliminating many classes of implementation bugs.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t have prevented Heartbleed, which isn&#x27;t a crypto implementation bug.",1398431395

It&#x27;s very hard to &quot;compete&quot; with a service that everyone is obligated to pay for anyway through their tax dollars. A good example is schools. In the U.S., private schools are allowed, but 90% (and increasing) of kids go to public schools. Is that because the public schools are better? No. It&#x27;s because taxpayers are obligated to pay for public schools anyway.<p>Furthermore, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s controversial to say that municipal services tend to be least common denominator affairs. Again, look at schools. I might personally be willing to pay twice as much property taxes to get well-funded schools that hire well-paid teachers, but good luck getting 51% of voters to agree to such tax increases.<p>Look also at power, water, and sewer utilities. Why are they so badly underfunded, and in a continual state of life support? As a yuppie, I&#x27;d be happy if my sewer bill went up by 500% (from $10/month to $50/month) if that meant a high-quality sewer system that didn&#x27;t dump raw sewage into the river when it rained. I&#x27;d be happy to pay a lot more for water that wasn&#x27;t flowing through old leaded pipes.

I think for telecom, it&#x27;s not a good thing, in that it won&#x27;t lead to an equilibrium that I think techies would be happy with. Say you wanted to build municipal fiber in San Francisco. What&#x27;s the body politic that will control that system? Do you think it&#x27;ll be techies? Of course not. It&#x27;ll be the folks that are out there picketing Google. The discussion will shift from provisioning high speed service to figuring out how to subsidize low-income and high-cost people. Or, take Seattle, which is not very dense and is quite sprawling. Do you think the political consensus will lead to installing fiber in the high-density, high-income, low-cost areas first?<p>It&#x27;s also interesting you use public libraries as an example. Municipalities all over the country are cutting library budgets to the bone. Why? Because people don&#x27;t care about them.

7646122,comment,7645592,7645592,13,0,Arkadir,,,"NoSQL discussions always seem to conflate three very different things: storage engines, APIs and architecture. Where do we store the data ? How do we access it ? How do we make sure it scales ?<p>The &quot;traditional&quot; approach is to use Oracle/SQL Server/MySQL for storage, SQL and/or ORM as an API, and single-server tables-with-relationships as an architecture. Back in the early 2000s, everybody did this. Sure, there were a few performance-minded exceptions that went with sharding or master-slave architectures instead, but those were exceptions.<p>And single-server architectures tend to behave badly at medium loads. Spend the market rate for a genius DBA, and they still behave badly at high loads. The next step is a 32-core 128GB RAM monstrosity that costs an order of magnitude more than what eight 4-core 16GB servers would cost.<p>Most NoSQL solutions came with a new architecture. You had the MongoDB flavor of distributed storage, or the BigTable flavor of distributed storage, or the CouchDB flavor of distributed storage, and so on. Properly implemented distributed storage eats high loads for breakfast: just add more servers. This is a good thing.<p>My issue with the NoSQL movement is that they threw away the baby with the bath water. They threw away the single-server relational architecture, which was a nice change, and they also gave up the old battle-hardened storage engines and the highly expressive SQL language and replaced them with only-recently-experimental engines and ad hoc lean APIs.<p>It takes time for a storage engine to mature. To have all its performance kinks ironed out and all its bugs smoked out. I still remember the brouhaha around MongoDB persistence guarantees, or the critical data loss bugs in CouchDB.<p>And the lean APIs just forced back all the querying logic into the application, with all the filtering and the manual indexing and the joins and the approximate but ultimately incorrect implementations of whatever subset of ACID was required at the time. This wasn&#x27;t an entirely bad thing: it certainly made many developers aware of the performance implications of some joins or transactions. But when you need to write a JOIN or GROUP BY or BEGIN TRANSACTION that you know will scale properly, and there&#x27;s no API support for it ? Feh.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the CouchDB architecture. Distributed change streams, with checkpointed views and cached reductions. But I have been burned by the CouchDB storage engine (can you say &quot;data corÊ–NÑ %ñXtion&quot; ?) and I see no point in bending knee to the laconic CouchDB API. So I took the CouchDB architecture and reimplemented it with a PostgreSQL back-end. It&#x27;s _faster_ (don&#x27;t underestimate the cost of those HTTP requests), I have trust that after PostgreSQL&#x27;s decade-long history all threats to my data are long gone, and I can always whip out an SQL query when I do need it.<p>It&#x27;s nice to see so many NoSQL solutions migrating back to an SQL-like API and gaining enough maturity to keep your data safe. In the near future, I expect them to be nothing more than &quot;Architecture in a box&quot; solutions for when you don&#x27;t want to implement specific architectures in SQL. And I expect more and more &quot;architecture plugins&quot; to become available: with a library, turn a herd of SQL databases into a distributed architecture of type X.",1398430866

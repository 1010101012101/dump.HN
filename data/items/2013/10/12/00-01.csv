6536789,comment,6534827,6536251,1,0,asdasf,,,">Haskell strikes me as very clever.<p>It is not.  You should check it out some time.  For purposes of this post I will pretend haskell and ghc are one in the same (ghc is the most popular haskell compiler).  Haskell is built around a very simple, straightforward core language (shockingly enough called &quot;core&quot;).  There is massive resistance to adding anything to haskell that can not be expressed in core and would require changing it.  Haskell values simple, powerful abstractions that can be widely re-used.  Haskell has not taken over the world because it doesn&#x27;t want to.  Python has not taken over the world either, I doubt many people would claim it is because python is too hard or too complex.  Taking over the world does not appear to have any correlation with being a good language.",1381539541

6536779,comment,6533102,6535419,3,0,yongjik,,,"Well, to be fair, many Korean bureaucrats resisted using Hangul for centuries, and Koreans kept three different writing systems: scholarly works and government documents in classical Chinese, lower-level bureaucrats using Idu (a system of writing Korean words using Chinese characters with the same sound), and Hangul.  I think the move to write everything in Korean only happened in 20th century.  Even then, most documents contained a liberal amount of Chinese characters to write Sino-Korean words (maybe due to Japanese influence?), which could be seen well into 1980s.<p>(And these days Koreans decided to put English vocabulary in the position of literary significance, and some would write sentences which are just strings of English words connected by Korean suffixes.  Grrrr.)<p>* Also one of the reason modern Korean spelling is so regular is that it&#x27;s totally revamped in 1930s thanks to the heroic work of Korean scholars who considered the work as means of preserving Korean culture under the oppressive Japanese regime.  It involved discarding four letters, adding a horde of new letter combinations to represent underlying forms, and a drastic shift from purely phonemic to morphophonemic script.  (Something like English always using &quot;-ed&quot; to mark past tense even though they sound different in parted, picked, and seemed.)",1381539417

The reason why border security or any law enforcement agency exists is because we want to maintain reasonable order, one way to achieve it is enforcement of existing laws.<p>But somehow enforcement of rules, some of which are highly questionable has taken center-stage over creating a sense of order.

It works like this -- let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re on welfare. If it&#x27;s a typical program you can stay in the program only if you don&#x27;t make much money the usual way. Once you start making your own money, the welfare ends, often in such a way that you have a smaller income than before your personal income increased. This was true about AFDC and it killed the program -- it was a powerful disincentive to work, or to rise economically. It kept the poor poor -- they had a disincentive to move upward.",1381538372

I think there are a few different ways you can approach this, but it depends on what you want to accomplish. I find the idea of &#x27;Innovation as a Discipline&#x27; to be interesting, and perhaps something that might help a large range of Startups spanning multiple industries. Making a comparison to fail-fast pivots alludes to the possibility that &#x27;Innovation as a Discipline&#x27; may represent a new approach or methodology towards Product Development. If this is the case, you may find yourself in a position to help a large number of Startups. However, if you are looking to work with a few specific Startups and develop Products (not methodologies), then my recommendation is to get involved with the Local Startup Ecosystem. Specifically, events like Hackathon&#x27;s or Startup Weekend types of Events. Those are the types of Events where you will find a large number of Groups/Teams working on Ideas and Products at the Ground Floor. I imagine you could easily find a few different Groups/Teams working with Ideas and products that you find interesting.<p>I recently decided to try an IdeaLab approach (or something close). My new approach is to conceptually design new and innovative products, validate the conceptual products with potential customers, and then build teams to execute the conceptual products.

Am I misreading the story or is refusal to enter the country not the proper response to not having the correct documentation?",1381536201
6536596,comment,6530536,6536229,5,0,pmarca,,,"I think it&#x27;s mostly situational depending on the kind of business.<p>For the classic, pure, viral, social and/or user-generated content businesses -- that will probably be monetized with advertising -- the generic headline metrics like daily/weekly/monthly active users and engagement/retention rate are important.  There are just so many new products that attempt to be the next Facebook/Twitter/Youtube/Pinterest that showing that you are already punching through the noise is pretty important.<p>For two-sided marketplaces (the next eBay/Etsy/AirBNB/Uber) it&#x27;s most important to have a real theory about how you&#x27;re going to get both sides of the flywheel spun up.  The traction doesn&#x27;t need to be gigantic but there needs to be a real plan.  We still see too much handwaving in this category -- it is REALLY hard to spin these up from a standard start and most simply languish and die.<p>For ecommerce and ecommerce-like busineses (the next Fab/Ziluly/OneKingsLane/Zulily), the most important thing is showing a model, with initial proof, of how the cost to acquire customers is less than the lifetime value of those customers.  For example, in recent years it has become harder to build these businesses based on Google keyword advertising -- search volume isn&#x27;t growing very fast, and lots of people are trying to acquire customers in most categories, and so keyword ad rates often get bid up to just past the point of unprofitability (the delta is the amount of excess funding going into businesses in these categories).  So creativity on customer acquisition -- and showing that in economic terms -- is key.<p>I think that a credible team with any of this in reasonable shape from a seed round is not going to have trouble raising an A in this environment.  But for those that have already raised an A, it has become really critical to have these factors nailed (whichever are appropriate) to be able to raise a B.<p>Finally, probably obvious but worth saying -- investors are all over the map on all of this stuff all the time.  It&#x27;s very valuable to be able to prequalify investors for interest and knowledge about particular categories -- and frankly IQ and judgment -- prior to meeting with them.  Good advisors and angels can be very helpful with this.  This is also why we try to be transparent on these topics (such as with Scott&#x27;s interview) -- better for us and for entrepreneurs to know how we think before they walk in the door.",1381536187

Looking through the feature comparison matrix may be quite confusing, especially if pro version is packed with not so frequently used features.<p>Also, if too many features are withheld from the lite version, it will drive users to use 'patched' pro versions. On other hand, if the lite version is liberal, the pro version will suffer as its usefulness will decline. Finding a balance depends on knowing your userbase and the userbase won't stabilize until the lite/pro matrix is stable. So it's a catch 22.",1224097038

But whence the guilt? Isn't programming useful? In the right hands, yes. But my projects (inventing a word processor, machine translation from one programming language to another, inventing a programming language of my own) could all be done better (and were) by professionals. It was a classic addiction: prolonged frustration, occasionally rewarded by a briefly glowing fix of achievement. It was that pernicious ""just one more push to see what's over the next mountain and then I'll call it a day"" syndrome. It was a lonely vice, interfering with sleeping, eating, useful work and healthy human intercourse. I'm glad it's over and I won't start up again.

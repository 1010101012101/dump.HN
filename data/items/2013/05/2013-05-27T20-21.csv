My parents were 37 and 40 years old at the time. At that time and for many years after that, I had tons of non-work priorities, certainly more than my parents. And I don't think that's an exception. Most people never really make work their priority. Don't mistake that for an age related phenomenon.<p><i>""Is it an example of ageism if someone who is 45 can't find a job when what they know is Ada, Cobol and Forth?""</i><p>No. Is it an example of racism if you didn't want to hire a drug trafficking nigerian scammer and pedophile as a baby sitter for your 5 year old daughter?<p>The idea that these are even relevant examples is ageism or racism. I don't know a single 45 year old software engineer who knows Ada, Cobol and Forth. They didn't serve in Vietnam either.<p>Everyone knows they have to be up-to-date with current technologies and it becomes easier with age because many changes are very superficial to the point of being trivial.",1369688384

Britain, Spain or going further back the Romans.<p>These involve components though that are unacceptable in modern warfare.  e.g. the threat and execution of collective punishment against large populations.  The smaller force doesn't need to subdue the entire population at once, just a chunk at a time.<p>For less extreme measures you would effectively need to put in place martial law and martial rule that governs every aspect of the populations' lives.  In this case you need enough force on the ground all the time to enforce it and those forces are going to take losses in a guerilla warfare situation (e.g. the Russians in Afghanistan).  Especially if someone is supporting the opposing side...<p>In Afghanistan it's a mix of issues:<p>1. The occupying force has low tolerance for casualties and is in defensive mode.<p>2. The population has a long history of overthrowing occupation and therefore assumes the same will happen here.<p>3. Everyone can see the lack of commitment for the occupying force.  This is not a ""win at all costs"" situation.<p>4. The Taliban is supported by external entities fighting a proxy war.<p>5.

The idea has been tried to death with countless software writing tools. MS DOS Dbase tools on top of dbase, written in clipper or what not to make CRUD applications by non programmers. There are generating tools from before that generating compile CRUD from just 'a business person definitions'. I have seen presentations from countless products like Filemaker, MS Access, Foxpro etc claiming that boring CRUD is gone and no programmers are needed anymore for application building.<p>When I was younger, one of the product managers for the Dutch product SDW told me that programming business software was something of the past as business people could just input 'how the app should work' and the app would be automatically built.<p>Outsystems have claimed this, as do Longjump and web based systems.<p>They all have something in common; they work for some cases, if you want more you have a problem. You CAN do it, but it's hard and the resulting 'code' (usually visual programming or 4GL)  will usually be bad. Ohyeah, and you're still programming. Worse than you would have with actual developers from the start.<p>Note that most of them start out as simple systems, like this SteveApp. That's nice; it serves a purpose. But when you get users, people will request features and these feature will, in the end, require a full fledged programming language. So now you have non programmers creating an app up to a point which they still get and for more they'll hire you. They did a bit of 'programming' though in the built in language, which was made easy (which usually translates to visual and/or 'very much like English), so not very terse and often not very well written.

Thanks.<p>If I can read through the mess, you seem to be saying you can't evaluate PNaCl, so you'll just make airy and overconfident assertions about it. Even on HN, that doesn't fly. -1!<p>When I challenge your further assertion that something is ""easily integrated into any browser"", you switch subjects to arguing for prototyping and developing a complex system before standardizing it. Good idea (but beware the difficulty standardizing it late if simpler evolutionary hops beat it in the meanwhile; more below on this). However true, that is a dodge, it does not excuse your assertion about ""easily integrated"".<p>Doubling down by citing ""the DOM"" as if Pepper were only about OS and DOM APIs, or as if even just the DOM implementations in different engines had enough in common to make interfacing from <i>native code</i> (not from JS, which is hard enough even with a decade+ history of written standards and market-driven interop testing) easy, just repeats this bad pattern. So -2.<p>Then you seem to confuse ES4 with Harmony (which I made clear came about after ES4 failed). -3.<p>At this point on USENET, you'd hear a <i>plonk</i>. But I'll close with one more point:<p>Mozilla and Google using LLVM does not equate to standardizing PNaCl. Pepper is one problem, a big one, but not the only one. Consider also the folly of using a linker-oriented intermediate representation for a shelf-stable Web-scale object file format.

Trying to standardize PNaCl -- including Pepper and LLVM IR abused or patched into shape as a long-lived object file format -- is an impossibly long, almost exclusively Google-dependent, path.<p>Extending JS among competing engines whose owners cooperate in Ecma TC39, via a series of much shorter and independently vetted and well-justified (by all those engine owners) path-steps?

3. A finding about Amazon will be completely irrelevant to Apple's conduct in this case.  The question is whether Apple committed horizontal price fixing.  Amazon's possibly illegal conduct is going to be completely irrelevant in that, as horizontal price fixing is still per-se illegal.  They could prove Amazon hurt the market a lot. They could prove whatever they like. As long as the DOJ proves they committed horizontal price fixing, it's game over.
Now, the supreme court may, in the end, decide horizontal price fixing should be analyzed under the rule of reason instead of being a per-se violation, but that's completely irrelevant to the current state of the law, and in fact, Apple's behavior. SCOTUS is not going to change the doctrine because they think Apple did the right thing here, they will change doctrine because they think the doctrine was wrong in general.  However, that doctrine is the current state of the law, and what this case, and the appeal, will be analyzed under.<p>4.

2. Get your prep work done first.
3. Pre-cook what can be pre-cooked.
4. Don't let anything spoil.  Cook what's about to turn.  Don't buy more than you will consume or cook for later consumption.
5. Make stuff from scratch.  It's cheaper in the long run.
6. Rotate your ingredients and buy what's in season.  It's fresher (#1) and cheaper (#5).<p>If you are a smart chef, you cook on Sundays and Wednesdays.  You make more than you need for that day's meal and assemble fresh meals from the cooked ingredients prepared on those days.<p>It's easy.  Buy a pound of bacon and cook the whole pound in the oven at once.  Now breakfast is an egg or two in a frying pan on the stove and some bacon reheated in the microwave.  Vegetables?  Buy a bunch of brocoli, blanch it and put it in the fridge.  Buy a bunch of spinach, blanch it and put it in the fridge.<p>Lunch is precooked chicken breast over blanched vegetables reheated in the microwave.  Add rice you've pre-cooked if that's your thing.<p>Dinner is a salad and protein that's reheated.  Chicken/beef/whatever.<p>Food isn't hard.  I spend less than 4 hours cooking per week and I eat super healthy using only fresh ingredients I buy at Whole Foods and the local natural market.  Grass-fed beef, marinated chicken, etc.<p>The only reason people in their 20's haven't learned to live this way is because nobody has ever made it a priority for them.

Anyone who has purchased enterprise software knows full well that you never pay ""once"". Far from it.<p>- For most organizations, using software without a support & maintenance contract is not a viable option, and yearly support & maintenance cost is typically ~20% of the product ""list"" price of the product. Many customers of large enterprise vendors typically see these costs go up every year. There has been revolts over this but often customer does not have much leverage.<p>- Unlike SaaS, companies who buy software products, have to pay for implementation and ongoing operations of the software as well. Enterprise products can be quite complex and require one or more people to operate it. Implementation costs alone can be hefty (often higher than software cost itself) and make SaaS a much much better option for the customer.<p>- Enterprise is littered with products that purchased but never used or no longer used.

If it doesn't do anything, she is most likely to get frustrated because to her, pinch gestures should zoom. I personally love gestures, but an interface that revolves around gestures might not be good for people who are already a bit afraid of technology",1369685072

5776320,comment,5775165,5776005,1,0,betterunix,,,"I do not think the problem is with how many options we are presented with, but rather with the difficulty of figuring out what primitives are actually needed to solve a particular problem, and how to compose those primitives.  Do you need digital signatures?  Do you need a hash function?  Do you need to establish a common random string before the system can be used?  It is very easy to assemble a system that appears secure (it's encrypted <i>and</i> signed!) but that does not actually provide any meaningful security (oh no, we actually needed non-malleable commitments!).<p>A high-level language could help quite a bit, because it would help programmers abstractly specify the needs of the system rather than getting lost in the details of which operations to choose.  Maybe you really only need to sign and encrypt your messages.  Maybe you need to sign, encrypt, then sign again.  Maybe you do not need signatures at all, but you need to use a non-malleable cipher and a few rounds of communication (e.g. to make a deniable authentication protocol).  The next generation of security problems will not be solved by slapping on encryption and digital signatures; we are going to need to pay increasing attention to higher-level issues.",1369685031

In terms of the act of coding, it's more flexible when you begin, and more flexible when you maintain. He's right of course that static types are more flexible in terms of carving out a particular subset of the space of possible programs (as context free grammars are more flexible that regular expressions).<p>That is, some simple and well-known facts are unknown to him. I still think he has something interesting to say, it just takes some extra work to get to it, and you have to take it with a grain of salt because although he's supremely confident, he's coming from quite a limited perspective.<p><i>EDIT</i> There's some hints in his conclusion and a comment that he does see real benefits to dynamic languages (without articulating them) - so perhaps he was just trolling or being ironic.",1303015529

Hint: A one time deflationary event is not the same as deflationary spiral. Previous deflationary event of similar magnitude happened 1920-1921. The ""Forgotten Depression"", so to speak.<p>Of course the FR (fractional reserve) banks are inherently instable and that's a feature of the system. If you want the ability to inflate the money supply at bankers' will and whim, don't act surprised when it (the money supply) collapses to more a sustainable level.<p>> .. caused people to hoard currency.<p>Source? Genuinely curious.<p>> This hoarding led to decreased investment and economic activity.<p>There was <i>decreased investment and economic activity</i>. But because of <i>hoarding</i>? It's too self-serving argument as such. There were at least 3 other major causes as well, and I can name them.<p>> the decrease in the money supply greatly increased the value of debts<p>Sure. So it means that the creditors are wealthier and can afford themselves to spend and invest more. Not what I'd call an economic horror.<p>Anyway, the most vivid evocation of horrors of a deflationary event is not a example of a deflationary spiral, and that's exactly what I was asking for.<p>Sure, if for whatever reasons the amount of money in an economy decreases then the prices had to adjust and it can be painful but.. what are options? But what this has to do with a deflationary spiral?",1303013010

Apple understands this - just look at their marketing.<p>GC? As has been said by others, it's not really on the wishlist.

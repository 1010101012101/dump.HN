There is a big-ass Javascript popup, apparently perpetrated by something called ""PostRank"", that obscures the page on initial load (in Safari 3/Mac). It has a list of posts labeled ""Top Posts"", none of which are the one I want to read. I can't figure out how to make this thing go away -- there is no close box, and clicking inside it links me away to something else -- and when I scroll the damn thing <i>follows me</i> to make very sure that I never get a glimpse of the actual post. I can't see around it.<p>Words cannot express how infuriating that widget is. It's like Snap.com <i>only more evil</i>. Banish it back to the nether regions from whence it came and submit this post again so I can actually read it.<p>UPDATE: Seriously, I can't get rid of it. Clicking inside it, clicking outside it, the Escape key, nasty words about its mother -- nothing works. I even tried following one of its links, and the resulting page had the <i>same obscuring widget on it</i>.

The school principals by and large took the sides of the parents.  Without an outside measure of standards, teachers would pass the kids to get keep them off of their backs.  Shame on them, but their pressures were real and unpleasant.  At least, those were the complaints I heard from the teachers I knew (and who occasionally opined in more public fora).<p>When Virginia introduced the Standards of Learning tests (years before NCLB), an amazing thing happened:  Teachers were still griping, but they were griping about how they were going to teach all of the stuff they now had to teach.  Importantly, their conversations turned back to teaching.<p>Yes, there is pressure to keep kids from failing.  But they simply can't be given a ""social promotion"" now; they are going to take an exam and will be exposed.<p>The teachers in the districts where I've been personally involved (via my kids) did something I think was pretty smart:  they started getting the parents to sign progress reports and notices nearly continuously throughout the term.  In some cases, the parents had to sign off on the assignments as they were give!  So there are few surprises at the end of the term.  Kind of a CYA move, but with all of the pressures (as you correctly pointed out) they had to do <i>something</i>.<p>The standards to which they are teaching aren't minimum at all.  They are pretty high.  My issue with them is that they are not well defined.  But I'll save that for another post.<p>I'll conclude this post with the observation that what teachers are complaining about now is not teaching to the <i>minimum</i> standard tests, but rather that they have to teach to the test at all.  They don't agree that what is important is being tested because it's hard to quantify.  I have some sympathy for that point of view.",1231883533

The more you try to anchor the idea to something you already know, the further away you understanding what's going on.<p>I think that when teaching or learning monads the concept to focus on is composing smaller units (computations) into larger ones (aggregate computations), often by passing the output from one computation into the next one.  It's also important to understand that once you have composed several small computations into a large computation you do not care or necessarily even know that the large computation is composed of smaller ones.<p>After meditating on that idea for a while it's necessary to see many different examples of useful monads.  The 'All About Monads' tutorial (probably the best monad tutorial) has a section which is all examples.  You need to see as many examples as possible because you can't understand monads by looking at a single specimen.<p>Monads are an abstract generality which provides a similar structure to many different things that you would never have expected to have much in common.  Without understanding that commonality, you're missing the point and monads will remain incomprehensible.",1231883407

For instance, there was a rash of complaints about Dreamhost a few years back because of cutting people off for too much CPU usage.  This is usually from people running PhpBB and WordPress with a zillion poorly-written modules, who were too cheap to pay for a VPS or something more appropriate to their traffic levels.<p>A lot of them moved to places like Site5 where they tended not to cut off customers. Sounds great if you're one of these guys using all the resources, but it sucks for the other 50 people on the shared box.  I experienced this firsthand where Site5 would sometimes become tremendously slow for no apparent reason, and the support staff would always just say they were ""looking into it"", but would never come up with a solution after months and months.

Heck, it's likely some people completely failed even when they were trying. Why? Every professor grades how they see fit. Yes, this is department and degree specific.

432712,comment,431786,431786,0,0,dasil003,,,"The essay itself is funny and rings true, but then in the comments the author says:<p><i>""What I'd really like to find are some appropriate libraries that I can use to provide several kinds of functionality for my project.""</i><p>And then lists a bunch of high-level website functionality requirements (user accounts, content management, etc).  I realize that the J2EE landscape was drowning in complexity and was pretty dismal in 2005, but this guy doesn't understand the issues involved in developing web applications.<p>First, to suggest that individual libraries can provide re-usable high level web application code is completely ludicrous.  It can't work for so many reasons:<p>* All those libraries will have to interact, and the interface between them will be complex.  If they do work together they will end up being tightly coupled and before you know it you have a framework.<p>* High level functionality that includes data models, persistence, and presentation layers is not generic enough to effectively be a library.  The complexity and configuration would quickly balloon out of control before it met even the requirements of 5% of web applications.<p>* Such libraries would end up being far more constricting than a traditional framework.  A good example is Drupal, which is a very powerful framework/CMS with an impressive hook system, and an extremely high code to functionality ratio.  Anything you might want to do with a website can probably be done in Drupal using a combination of existing modules, and you can write additional modules that access almost any part of the system and modify its behavior.  The problem is that fine-tuning of the interface or certain kinds of customizations become very difficult under the crushing weight of the underlying assumptions that Drupal makes to enable it's magnificent generic-ness.  The result is that all the various sites made with Drupal end up feeling very Drupal-y and there's a disincentive to really design your UI from the ground up and create a very optimized application.<p>What J2EE has blinded the author to is the fact that web frameworks exist to solve the most common problems that come up over and over again in web development.  He needs to go write a few PHP applications to get a feel for the issues, then try something lighter-weight like Django or Rails that confronts those issues directly and then basically gets out of the way.  In the first half of the decade it was hard to find a good lightweight framework because people were still wrapping their heads around the actual issues that needed to be solved.  Nowadays, not so much.",1231881593

We generally organize each sub-team as 2 or 3 clusters of desks, with 4-6 developers sitting back-to-back and QA and PM on the opposite sides of the cluster.  It makes pair-programming much easier, since all the developer's chairs are in the same open area, so you can easily pair with someone to the side or that sits behind you.<p>My current part of the floor has maybe 35 people in it, and there's kind of four sides of a rectangle to the building, so overall there are about 140 people or so on the floor.  Generally, the clusters are spread out enough that you can't hear conversations that are happening more than about 20 feet away anyway, so the primary conversations you'll overhear are from other people on your sub-team, which are exactly the conversations you really want to be overhearing anyway.  It really helps to keep everyone on the team in the loop about what's going on.<p>We have offices around the perimeter of the building that are unused so that people can grab them to have impromptu whiteboard discussions or make phone calls, which also keeps the general noise level down.",1231880627

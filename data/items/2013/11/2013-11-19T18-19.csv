I want my TV to show pictures and maybe make sounds from a useful range of input connections, and nothing else.<p>I can add my own features by connecting different sources to the TV, and so can anyone else who ever bought a FreeView box or PVR or other similar device. And that way, we can also ignore those sources that don&#x27;t serve our interests, and upgrade or replace the supplementary sources as things like catch-up and on-demand services evolve, without throwing out perfectly good TV hardware.<p>I get that the TV brands want to jump on the advertising bandwagon, but this is the UK, home of the (commercial-ad-free) BBC. The vendors aren&#x27;t going to be popular if they try to ram this obvious backward step down our throats, and I suspect they may be surprised by how many of us will vote with our wallets to avoid it.

It is, however, a great way to reduce risk. It&#x27;s my personal opinion that something even as simple as an UPDATE statement comes at a great cost on your production environment. It should be tested all the way up the chain of environments, backups should be issued on your database, etc, etc.  It&#x27;s really not easy unless you&#x27;re whole-heartedly okay with the potential ramifications of &quot;cowboy coding&quot; so to speak.

You have to stop and take a breather every now and then.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t even like the term &quot;sprint&quot; in Agile methodologies and try not to use it. I prefer &quot;iteration&quot; anyway, because it doesn&#x27;t carry the same connotation of absolute, balls-out, do-or-die effort, which can actually be harmful.<p>But regardless of what you call the time-boxed increments, I prefer to never have more than three in a row that are done in full-on &quot;sprint&quot; style.  Ideally, every 4th iteration or so, would be a &quot;light&quot; iteration that A. lets everyone catch their breathe, and B. gives some time for taking care of the &quot;loose ends&quot; that otherwise fall through the cracks.  Stop (or at least slow down), look at the big picture, look at paying down technical debt, and don&#x27;t work yourself into an early grave.

Because Semper Augustus no longer exists.<p>So you can &#x27;plant new tulips at will&#x27; the same way you can &#x27;paint new Rembrandts at will&#x27; ie. slap some paint on a canvas and hope it looks vaguely similar and that&#x27;s the best you can do, since you can never ever get another real Rembrandt or real Semper Augustus.",1384887066

As others have pointed out, it&#x27;s actually very common for consoles to sell at little or no margin.<p>Importantly for Sony, the cost of manufacturing the PS4, relative to the cost of the system at retail versus how things were with the PS3 is a vast improvement.  Sony is likely taking a small loss on the console, but took very large losses when initially selling the PS3.<p>They were in the position of having to sell a lot of games and accessories to make up for the loss on the PS3, whereas even a single game or accessory sale probably makes up most if not all of their loss on the PS4.<p>The article also really misses some crucial points.  For one, it&#x27;s not just about games.  There are accessories (controllers, playstation camera, controller charging stations, covers, etc.), digital downloads (skins, avatars, etc.), Playstation Plus, Sony&#x27;s music streaming service, and a whole array of revenue streams that are fairly high margin and in most circumstances the loss they took on the console should be made up quickly.<p>From another angle, Sony is already at a price advantage and there&#x27;s a decent chance they won&#x27;t discount the device as manufacturing prices drop.  This is the exact opposite position the PS3 was in as it was much more expensive than it&#x27;s competition and Sony had to continually discount the machine to stay in the running with the Xbox 360.<p>Finally, a small aside.  I think it&#x27;s interesting now that the PS4 is on x86 and using a straightforward unified memory architecture.  Doing a bump on this (double memory, double cores, double GPU compute units) doesn&#x27;t seem very far fetched and could probably happen at\na similar price point within 5 years.  This would give Sony a new console with a huge back catalog of games that would not need to be ported (and could even have &quot;HD&quot; add-ons for download), plus a bunch of new power for games on an architecture developers are already familiar with.  All this and it would likely cost a lot less to develop as opposed to developing new hardware from scratch as has been done for every generation previously.  I think it would be an interesting move and could allow Sony to have a long running platform to compete with.",1384886666

In the end, expressive power is conferred more by paradigm and language than editor.<p>In this case, IntelliSense gives you visibility into available methods and their signatures right in the environment. When working in a larger codebase (LLVM in my case), it&#x27;s very helpful to not have to look up documentation. Then there are tools like ReSharper which you can think of as &quot;higher-order editing&quot; tools that understand the semantics of the code and use it as a basis for manipulation, rather than simply modifying the textual representation of the code.<p>Vim is great at manipulating text, but not as good at understanding the code. IDEs are worse at manipulating, but a bit better at the latter. For most things, I reach for Vim. For bigger code bases, I&#x27;m pretty happy in an IDE, as long as it stays out of my way.",1384886631

But a lot of the problem is just people not bothering to learn what&#x27;s available.<p>The IntelliSense has better defaults than you get with most emacs modes, which is possibly why people notice a difference (i.e. in VS you don&#x27;t have to _do_ anything, it auto suggests, and completes on punctuation, and always pops up a lot of nice info, all out of the box). But I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s anything there you can&#x27;t achieve in emacs, depending on your language - certainly in Java with flymake and the eclipse compiler you can do some good stuff.<p>The huge gulf, for me, is with refactoring. Visual Studio with Resharper is vastly, vastly more intelligent, powerful and reliable than anything you&#x27;ve likely cooked up in emacs, even with semantic mode etc. And I think this unlocks a lot of productivity - sometimes a problem isn&#x27;t just text, it&#x27;s deeply tied to the semantics of your code, and in VS (again, I&#x27;m assuming nobody uses it without Resharper) you can be performing refactorings at a pretty high level without skipping a beat. In emacs, not so much. The degree to which that happens in your code is the degree to which you&#x27;ll notice and become bothered by it.<p>Again, this is for OO languages. I would certainly like more refactoring power than I have with clojure today, but nothing that&#x27;s so far above and beyond just day-to-day paredit that I&#x27;ve bothered.",1384885563

In case you hadn&#x27;t noticed, there appears to be a tradition in programmer circles of picking SPJ quotes and turning them into memes. &quot;Haskell is useless!&quot; and &quot;Avoid success at all costs!&quot; are some others.<p>I think you have this backwards. People have been saying that laziness has unpredictable performance characteristics (especially when it comes to space usage) as long as there have been lazy functional languages. SPJ was referring to that common sentiment; it didn&#x27;t somehow materialize because of comment he made during a talk.<p>There was an era where space complexity and space usage semantics were a big deal in functional programming, e.g. the work on giving a precise definition of &quot;tail call optimization&quot; and the emphasis on space safety that has since been present in the strict functional programming world. In contrast, there is no standard space semantics for lazy languages, and certainly none that GHC respects. It&#x27;s tricky when simple CSE can dramatically alter the space complexity of your program, e.g.<p><a href=\"https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/947\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/947</a>\n<a href=\"https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1752\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1752</a>",1384885436

If you think like that you are completely misunderstanding the entertainment industry and their cost structure.<p>Actually making the game (not the disc but what’s <i>on</i> the disc) is extremely expensive and the production costs of AAA games are actually exploding. Think of all the more or less non-automateable manual work that is involved in creating believable virtual worlds. Think of all the textures that have to be painted, things that have to be animated, lines of dialog that have to be written and voice-acted. Much of this is hard, manual work. There is no way to make it better except by paying more people more money to do it.<p>The second thing that costs a lot is marketing, i.e. making sure that everyone and their grandparents actually know about the game and want to buy it, mostly because making AAA games is so expensive already, so it better be successful.<p>It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about the new consoles and the future of (AAA) games. Even last generation expensive games like the Tomb Raider reboot sold tons of copies but were nevertheless barely satisfactory in their financial performance. Think about what kind of challenge it must be to make a game for a console fewer people have and that also needs much better assets (i.e. is more expensive) because what’s the justification for making a next-gen game otherwise?<p>The next few years will be extremely interesting for video games. I’m very much looking forward to see how that shakes out (though I wouldn’t necessarily want to work on AAA games). Will there only be few, safe and expensive mammoths like GTAV? Or safe and boring yearly updates to games like Call of Duty? Some of this is already happening. Just look at the bankruptcy of THQ. And on the other end of the spectrum there are tons of indie games popping up (which purposefully limit their scope – mostly by not creating photo-realistic virtual worlds – to get by with much less money).<p>This is a terribly exciting time for video games and I wouldn’t be surprised if this industry looks completely different in ten years (the supposed life-span of these new consoles – maybe the last consoles?).<p>All of this is not to say that Sony doesn’t take a hit on the console but plans to make money some other way, that is probably very true. But it doesn’t have anything to do with the fact that making a plastic disc costs a few cents.",1384884158

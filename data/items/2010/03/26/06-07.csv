1220441,comment,1220266,1220266,0,0,greenlblue,,,"I think there is a need for more social analysis of all these technologies and the possible long term consequences. Most people have a very limited view of the world and technology is supposed to do the opposite by opening up avenues that we wouldn't have explored because of high entry barriers and whatnot. A malleable social graph seems to be a step in the wrong direction. My view of things is limited and myopic and I don't want emerging technology reinforcing that habit by actually adapting to my current habits and regurgitating it back to me.",1269586680

However if you climb the stack of a goroutine to the top and there is no defer, you'll exit with a stack backtrace.  So every goroutine has to have a defer if you want protection.<p>The problem comes in the fact that goroutines are considered cheap and are launched for all sorts of reasons.  Sometimes in large numbers.  If even one of those goroutines does not have a defer set up, then an exception can crash the program.<p>The use case I'm worried about is a webserver.  In serving a web page I generally am happy to throw an exception, let it be caught at the top level, log it, then return a 500 page, internal server error.  Watch your logs, fix the bugs, and release better software.  However if you take this strategy with go, then the careless application programmer can accidentally take down the webserver.<p>What I'd like to be able to do is have a smart person set the webserver up, and then be able to let more junior programmers write code for an application on top of it knowing that there are some limits to the likely damage that they'll do.",1269586415

The earth is bigger and more massive and has a stronger gravitational field so in principle it is possible for the pen to float towards the earth, the pen would have to be a lot higher than a person's height but it could work. Anyway, I'm getting off track here. A while ago I read about David Hestenes and Eric Mazur and their experiments about students' intuitive understanding of physics before taking a physics class and after taking a physics class. These results are perfectly in line what Hestenes and Mazur discovered and both of them are excellent teachers.

I may not be able to get 100% accuracy on the redirect, but I can get the user to an issue page of the archive where they can click the story they intended to see.  The problem is that there is no metadata associated with those links to get a better idea of what story it was.  news1.html isn't terribly descriptive.<p>To put this in perspective, I get approximately 40000 unique 404s from spiders every day for things that simply don't exist and never did.",1269583571

Netbooks are becoming cheaper and cheaper (much cheaper than readers even then), smartphones are becoming better and better - and those are full-fledged computers.""<p>To this day, I still don't completely know the answer....except what I do know is that a lot of people spend a lot of money on eBook readers.\nPerhaps it's something along the lines of facebook chat - just because facebook has it, and ALL your facebook friends are on it doesn't mean people have switched over to it en masse. I still use and prefer many other chat programs - perhaps for stylistic, habitual, or illogical reasons - but significant reasons enough.<p>To foursquare - I say keep going. At the very least, competition is good, and at best, I think you have a good shot.",1269583474

1220374,comment,1220298,1220298,0,0,hristov,,,"This is bad, but when you think about it, the answer is not as obvious as it initially seems.<p>I believe the earth's gravity is stronger than the moon's even on the surface of the moon. In order to get the correct answer a student must think about orbital velocities and the way velocity helps objects stay in orbit and not fall to the ground, even if there is a gravity force exerted on them. And then the student would have to imagine the pen not as something stationary on the moon, but as something that is travelling around the earth (with the moon) at high velocity, and then the student would have to realise that the pen has sufficient orbital velocity not to fall to the earth, but in relation to the moon it has very little orbital velocity, so it will fall to the moon and not to the earth.<p>So my point is this is not that simple and it requires some imagination and complicated reasoning to get the right answer.<p>Of course most people should get it by remembering the moon landing videos and remembering how the astronauts were bound by the moon's gravity in those videos, but maybe kids these days have not even seen the moon landing videos.",1269583324
1220373,comment,1219401,1220088,0,0,pshc,,,"I agree with your post. That said, maybe the problem is the <i>text.</i><p>There are many artificial problems we create for ourselves by using strings for everything. Programming languages in particular have upper limits on expressiveness due to syntax issues. We can't easily annotate expressions or types with extra details without filling the screen with symbols; characters don't scale. Keying every resource with a unique human-readable string causes import conflicts, broken backwards compatibility, and hundred-line diffs - all in the name of renaming one function. Mistakes like ambiguous identifier-scope lookups, block structure/indentation mismatches, and operator precedence issues eat up valuable programmer hours repeatedly, in exactly the same way each time.<p>We've designed better languages to mitigate these effects, but we can only do so much. We can do static analysis to catch common errors and incremental compilation in the editor itself, but the heuristics can only work in a fraction of innumerable cases. Even simple syntax highlighting is intractable in many cases. If we programmed in structure with an AST-aware editor, whole classes of artificial problems would vanish in an instant. (To be replaced by the UI issues of a whole different paradigm in editors...)<p>Well, there are plenty of people working toward this, myself included. We'll see.",1269583318

The earth is 200,000+ miles away, which is why the moon's gravity will win out over the earth's.<p>It's really sad that college physics students failed so badly at the question.",1269583307

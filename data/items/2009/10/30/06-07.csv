Be successful first - your name is less (hat tip, notauser) important.<p>I like that that 25+ year old research has a modern-day equivalent.",1256885700

911643,comment,909981,910624,0,0,gchpaco,,,"Java is not a good benchmark.  Sun's JVM won't even pack memory (if you have a class with 64 ""boolean"" variables, it takes header + 64*4 bytes, not header + 64/8 bytes, for some reason that is utterly unclear) unless you use arrays of primitives, and my experiments indicate that it just shifts to packing on a 32 byte boundary to packing on a 64 byte boundary on a 64-bit VM.  That is to say the Sun JVM does implement the naive ""everything is twice as big"" translation even though it needn't.<p>Of course the 32-bit JVM also has a 2.5 gig or so address space limit that makes no goddamn sense whatsoever, so if you want to process more than 2 gigs of data for any reason you have to either do it offline or you have to buy twice as much memory and do it on a 64 bit VM.",1256885045

But my frustration isn't with companies or corporations, it's with the cavalcade of idiots theoretically responsible for regulating them and generally structuring the market to produce desirable outcomes.<p>That's where our collective ire ought to be concentrated.  Whenever someone starts railing about the evils of corporations, it's generally a (conscious or unconscious) distraction from the true culprits: regulators or overseers who aren't doing their job.",1256884762

For example, I had no problem taking a course that required linear algebra, or signal analysis, or data structures (none of which I had taken; eg, I took Data Structures II before I). You pick up the missing pieces as you go. I actually had more fun that way - ""Signal Analysis"" was much more interesting when I already knew the applications!<p>BTW, I didn't do this on purpose.

(Also, I've always preferred Konqueror as a file browser to whatever Ubuntu uses by default with Gnome.)<p>However, it's been a while since I've used it (I have 10.4 and XP machines for the most part), and I get the feeling that Gnome has benefited from Ubuntu far more than KDE has from Kubuntu, being sort of a bastard stepchild at best.<p>KDE's Konqueror has features that I still find myself wishing for on my Mac on a daily basis.  (E.g., the visual view-by-size thing and built-in sshfs are my top two.)<p>I've not seen any compelling reason to upgrade my Macs from 10.4, so when they finally hit EOL I may seriously reevaluate Kubuntu as my main desktop, see if it's kept up reasonably well versus the mainline Gnome version.",1256884383

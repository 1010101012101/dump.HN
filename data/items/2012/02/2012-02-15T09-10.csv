You should CC it to $OWNER so that he knows we've taken action on the IP agreement we made with him, or if you'd prefer I can forward him a copy.""<p>Boss directs you to steal it anyway Option B: ""Alright boss, push or shove time.  You can, probably, convince someone here to copy that code for you.  If you do, I will hand in my resignation immediately.  Think it over.""<p>Boss directs you to steal it anyway Option C: ""I quit, effective immediately.""<p>n.b. In many US states you can get fired for just about anything, including ""no reason at all.""  Regardless, the market for engineers is super hot right now.  Work for someone who isn't an abusive jerk, because you're highly likely to find that he is not solely abusive to business partners.<p>n.b. #2: It is almost impossible in the US to get away with withholding salary for work already performed.  One complaint to your state's labor relations board and he'll wish he had never been born.  This assumes you have an employment relationship with the new evil boss.  If you're working without a contract (don't ever work without a contract), you're probably best served by just writing off the three days or whatever you have invested in this job.",1329299968

2) It's the deletionists who think it's their job to lobotomize WP and delete knowledge out of the public sphere
3) It's the super editors who enable the deletionists and there's no reasonable mechanism to police either them or the deletionists.<p>I agree that there's a lack of oversight. The self-licking ice cream cone of the WP community built bureaucracy is finally starting to come apart because there's no reasonable way to participate in the bureaucracy unless you are an established part of it.<p>In the end, WP will be an interesting curiosity, populated by people drunk on the power their carved out fiefdom in the tangled mess of WP processes gives them, typing furiously about how great their contribution was to the great edifice of WP while their deletionist minions slowly burn the castly down around them until all that's left is a slightly dog eared copy of the Encyclopedia Britannica.<p><i>edit</i> reading through the rest of the comments, this idea is repeated over and over and over again.

3593693,comment,3591243,3591863,1,0,dasil003,,,"Of course copying can be good.  Code reuse is a good principle.  Generally we want people to most efficiently utilize the resources available.  Failure to do so is even dubbed Not-Invented-Here syndrome.  Ethics aside whatever you can use to get the job done faster is advantageous.<p>The problem is that programming is not a cut and paste job.  To me the difference between a good programmer and a mere coder is that the programmer has the confidence to solve any problem and debug any issue.  Even if you are just doing maintenance work and not working on new features, you need to be able to synthesize and refine an increasingly subtle understanding of the system you are working on.  People who don't understand this end when asked to debug something end up just poking at it until they get the output they want.  They have no clue whether their ""fix"" will break 100 other things because they are not forming a proper mental model.  I would like to believe that this is inherently obvious to any working programmer, but I can see how it's not if you are under the impression that original work is only done by a few super geniuses, and the vast majority of people in the field are just searching around for something to copy.  I certainly have seen this mentality both online in forums, but also in my undergrad CS degree where there were a handful of students who spent extraordinary energy trying to find someone to copy and didn't ever appear to give a rat's ass about any of the material.",1329299290

People are drawing parallels between the movement and the early days of the tech scene, predicting DIY bio will be as big and influential as today's DIY tech scene.<p>While I want to be optimistic about that, the comment from Declan Soden in the article seems pretty spot on.<p>Putting together genes into plasmids and bacteria is just the beginning. The main goal is to endow some organisms with new useful traits. The problem is, testing the trait becomes increasingly difficult for DIY biologists because it is rarely as easy as putting the genes together. How do you test if your bacteria has made the desired anticancer compound? You need to chemically analyze your product, and ultimately you need to try it on people.<p>This is different compared to software. Open source software can become what it is today, because testing the software itself is relatively easy. Want to write a new browser? Just use it yourself. How about a new media player?

I should be able to tap download (quickly authenticate, if I must) and have the app on my home screen next time it's out of my pocket.<p>And 100% web-based, none of this WebView-in-a-iTunes-shell bullshit.<p>Right now the problem is this: the only time the user is ever in ""I want an app"" mode is when they're <i>already</i> surfing the app store, and as we've already established, the current app discovery channels (being featured, and being ranked) is pretty limited.<p>User sees someone share a picture from Instagram on Facebook. User clicks through to see what this Instagram hubbub is all about. Instagram throws a slick video and website at user. User is super sold. User now has to pull out his/her phone, open the App Store (which, btw, is a horrifyingly slow app), search ""Instagram"", tap Install, authenticate, and <i>wait</i>.<p>Or, if you're <i>really</i> lucky, user is on the <i>exact</i> computer they sync their phone against (if indeed they sync their phone at all!) - you can do a slick redirect to iTunes, where user can download the app... and have it downloaded automatically on the device too... if user has iCloud enabled... and auto-app-download enabled... you hope.<p>Geeeeeeeeez.<p>Here what Apple needs to do - offer a solution for app makers willing to market their own products. Have a simplified checkout page, PayPal style. I'm willing to do all the legwork, you don't need to show screenshots or have long-winded (and poorly formatted) app descriptions for me. I will do the selling, you just guide the user through the checkout in as frictionless a process as possible. Throw in reviews if you don't trust me and want to warn your users. Sure.<p>Remove the friction between the user and acquiring an app. Make it web-based, make it so that people can discover, learn more about, and buy apps from <i>anywhere</i>, on <i>any</i> device, on <i>any</i> platform.",1329298240

4. Delete all data a reasonable time after comparison / mapping is done.<p>This way, although it's not unbreakable, there are the advantages of:<p>- Encrypted, pre-hashed data over the wire.

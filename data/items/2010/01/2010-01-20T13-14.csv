1064732,comment,1063485,1064678,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"In our case all candidates are reasonably corrupt. Most current politicians started their careers in the chaos following the '89 revolution, when a lot of the public wealth was sold for ridiculous prices. The current president is pretty well known for involvment in selling the state commerce fleet. What we do know for sure is that he's a pretty good manager, and the other guy is a lot more corrupt. So we voted for him, twice.<p>The biggest problem I think is a bit different. I'm very very scared by the politicization of public institutions. Top management is always chosen based on party, and automatically so is middle management. This breeds a brand of bureaucracy interesting more in politics than in getting things done, and the more it lasts the lower the mindset seeps.",1263995851

I'm not convinced the leaders of rich countries think much beyond their next re-election, and whilst there may be some benefit to having cheap labour, you need a reasonable infrastructure in place to take advantage of that. You can't run a factory if you don't have a reliable power supply, for example.",1263992724

You don't know it happens when it happens, it's often for a shaky reason, and there is no place to discuss it other than emailing PG (which just seems wasteful, a feeling that was reinforced by PG's very curt tone throughout).<p>When seeking assistance for a hellban of my very own, I was emailed by several helpful HN power users, all giving basically the same opinion -- ""The HN moderation is capricious and deaf"", in one user's words.  That's an uncomfortable assessment from regular site contributors.",1263992684

In fact, I always read comments first and look for such short summaries. So, I thought it'd be nice to have a place, where you can store a couple of sentences from the original article which best characterize it and then share a short link to this quote on twitter or elsewhere, instead of a direct link to the long original article.<p>quotty.com",1263992471

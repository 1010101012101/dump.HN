Just introduce a simple correction that fulfills the requirement for his particular test case. Why you'd wonder what the academic standards are in a univesity that even allows such people to enter the door, this modus operandi is even encouraged the 'industry' under the moniker of 'test-driven development'.",1216873887

It's not this year or next year, but Facebook could become the equivalent of what Microsoft Windows is on the desktop (although much less valuable, since the Web is a more anarchic environment than the desktop).",1216873536

Okay, it might not have the revenues to warrant it, but it has a rampant audience, many of who treat Digg like a game and spend hours on it every day increasing their karma. That sort of support is what can fuel the site enough to drag it into the mainstream with Google's help, and why it's worth mega money.",1216872866

So bother with prepared statements or other expensive (performance-wise) database server tools?""<p>Is it too much to ask that bloggers know what they are talking about?<p>Prepared statements are not expensive performance wise. In fact they usually result in a slight increase in speed because they factor out the time required to parse and plan the query and even if some performance is lost thorugh suboptimal planning (rare), the gains in security are well worth it.<p>For some reason, bloggers post excellent and insightful posts about everything CS until they hit databases where their common sense goes on vacation.",1216872829
255064,comment,254569,254867,0,0,brianlash,,,"That begs an important question: What's good design?<p>Good design in a magazine print ad is different from good design on a fashion blog is different from good design in a web app or a mail client.<p>So good design should be judged in terms of what it's supposed to do.  In that light it seems the best design for Gmail is that which <i>gets in the way least</i>, because it's efficiency that counts when you're using it.",1216872770

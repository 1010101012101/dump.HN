Designing & mfg'ing some of our own and OEM'ing the rest. We've hit (nearly) every product roadblock you can think of, too. Now battling with electrical certification (much more stringent north of the border) and steeply rising shipping costs from asia. I personally spent almost a year in China starting a product dev engineering office & chasing dead-end manufacturer leads (now we're mfg'ing in Canada) culminating in a massive burnout (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=69097"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=69097</a>) but after some R&R and soul-searching, have been able to re-join the fray.\n:)",1212546242

Craig Venter seems to have already taken an offer that he couldn't refuse from said companies.<p>Do you think anyone in the field is brave enough to go around the oil companies or is their distribution infrastructure too much to ignore?",1212546160

That's only true once it reaches some equilibrium temperature, which may not be room temperature. If you stick a room-temperature metal sheet outside on a sunny day, it will heat up until it reaches a steady state where the rate of heat absorption is equal to the rate of heat dissipation -- this can be significantly higher than room temperature, which is why pieces of metal outside on a hot day are really really hot.",1212544959

Monstera is implemented in a subset of C++ programming language. ... \nKey ideas:\n1. Object oriented language for object oriented kernel. When NT was implemented, C++ wasn&#x27;t that good. \n...\n4. Don&#x27;t drift away too much. It&#x27;s still based on NT architecture, but think of it as if Microsoft Research would decide to reimplement NT in C++ for fun.&quot;",1384326170

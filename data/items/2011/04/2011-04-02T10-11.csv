The question is good research, and your point is one reason it is.<p>Note:  Although in computing your use of 'orthogonal' is common, a better word choice would be 'independent' or just 'unrelated'.<p>For you I will try to be still more clear:  When I started working on airline scheduling, I talked to a famous mathematician and explained my airline fleet scheduling problem.  Right away he said:  ""NP-complete"" and then dismissed my work as hopeless.  He was wrong, badly wrong.  Airline fleet scheduling can work quite well in practice, thank you.  His blurting out ""NP-complete"" was just a way to dismiss practical problem solving.<p>For some good public information on airline fleet scheduling, see the work of Ellis Johnson, then at IBM's Yorktown Heights lab, using IBM's Optimization Subroutine Library (OSL), for American Airlines.  Ellis understands NP-complete just fine, but he also knows that it's possible in practice to do quite well on the NP-complete problems of real airlines.<p>Again, our goals in practice do not have to wait for P versus NP.

2399641,comment,2398782,2398946,5,0,alextp,,,"Except bribes undermine social fairness significantly. Notice that as the clerk presumably knows how much money he should give you for your tax returns there is a strong incentive for him to ask for a bribe that covers a significant share of your tax returns, effectively making the entire tax return process useless for the citizen.<p>Also, if you think of a slightly different scenario, imagine the office is only allowed to issue X tax returns a month (maybe the money comes in packets), and the bribe is required to cut the line. Now it's really unfair and wrong, and a lot more so for the briber than for the bribee.<p>You should have in mind that it's not actually that hard to bribe people indirectly. Any place with a bribing culture tends to have people you can hire to unofficially bribe some government employee to do something for you. In Brazil these are called ""despachantes"" (dispatchers), and even though in the last decade or so they have been getting progressively more useless as the country moves away from a bribing culture, you should keep in mind that a lot of despachantes are legally incorporated and even pay taxes.

Not only the numbers, but the trends would totally not match up with our own internal Google Analytics, and even the data such as top referrers etc. were way off. Compete should not be used as supporting evidence that Techcrunch is fading.<p>The number of re-tweets, comments, referral traffic, twitter subscribers, Techememe headlines, HN headlines, story leads etc. is as high as ever. Monthly uniques are nowhere near the 1M compete would want us to believe they are.<p>There are a few different types of blogger. Those who don't get access to stories and rely on press releases, generally boring. Then there are those who get access to information, but refuse to post about it for fear of pissing somebody off, just as boring and probably worse than the first type. Then there is the type of blogger who gets access to information, and has no problem stepping on toes to get the information out.<p>Mike is of this variety. You could say that he is the prime example of the new breed of process journalist - he would rather a (now rather low) error rate on 1-2% of stories in order to get the other 98% out there for the audience. I have intimate knowledge of how he works and how he puts stories together - to the extent that even now, with him on the other side of the world, I can read a story on headline and put together what went on behind the scenes to get this story out (such as the Facebook stock story). He is constantly on the phone and emailing people. He literally has hundreds of people on speed dial, on skype and in his email contact list - he would send dozens of single-line emails each day building information up around the story, and over the years has gotten very good at both extracting responses from people first, and then figuring out what is really happening by triangulating.<p>Sometimes the stories are posted a little early, and you see that process play out through a post being edited or through multiple posts that make up a larger story (like Scamville, and almost certainly this Facebook stock story). Arrington and his stories reflect the scene - if he is pumping a startup, it is because through talking to dozens of investors he keeps hearing about it. He rarely is the first to step out, but is a lot better at capturing mood and opinion and then amplifying it. He can also put his finger on what is wrong and what is right - and Angelgate was an example of that.<p>That also applies to this Facebook stock story. Do you really think he would just pick on him for no reason? Or is it more likely that he got a tip about it, confirmed it with one more person, phoned Facebook to talk about it (who asked to be off the record), contacted the guy in question, and then posted the story? A blogger who just makes things up and is wrong would never have an audience.<p>You only ever have to talk to anybody who has worked with Mike, any startup who has gone through the process with him, or any other blogger who respects that process, to understand that there is something special going on there. Mike has a lot of people he can count on in his circle and within the industry because of that. I watched him approach almost every word in a post with a lawyer's caution - he would constantly review even after a post is published and the possibility of not getting something right totally eats at him (to the point where he can't sleep). You have completely mischaracterized him as being careless, from a guy who used to wake me up at 5am just to check the smallest details of a story. Just shows that you totally do not understand what and who you are trying to diss at.<p>If you don't like this style of story - then don't read it. There are plenty of blogs that just churn out press release after press release and appease those who don't want to see the boat rocked. But don't attempt to string together poor traffic stats and two or three misses from a collection of thousands of hits into some narrative about Techcrunch failing.<p>If Techcrunch earned a dollar for ever blog post that has been written about it failing or jumping the shark then it could easily double revenue. Fact is that right now it still dominates startup news, is one of the main outlets to reach a startup audience if your are launching a product, and even with Mike writing less it is not fading anywhere - since his style is contagious and has been picked up by other writers.<p>I have seen this trend cycle of things being cool when new, and then suddenly uncool when popular, play out too many times not to be wise to it. There is nothing wrong with reading Techcrunch <i>and</i> other blogs, this isn't winner takes all. I enjoy reading HN, Reddit, The Startup Foundry, etc. This isn't grade school where you need to pick a team to be on and do your best to fight the other tribe (especially including personal attacks, which completely makes you cheap) - if you think you can do better in any way, try it, keep writing with Venturebeat and don't bitch about it - the readers and audience will decide based on quality not on preaching.",1301739875

2399635,comment,2399570,2399570,27,0,TomOfTTB,,,"There are a lot of flaws in this analysis...<p>1.  Yes Techcrunch's traffic is down according to Compete but so is the traffic from other sites that cover the same space.  In the last 6 months Venturebeat for example is down 73%.  ReadWriteWeb is down 38%.  Even smaller sites are down.  CenterNetworks covers relatively the same space and they're down 38%.  By comparison Techcrunch is only down 29%.<p>2.  The author states Michael Arrington making increasingly inflammatory posts as a reason why techcrunch will fail.  But in my experience such posts tend to draw traffic.  More to the point Arrington has been at this for a while, he uses analytics and he's not stupid.  If the inflammatory posts weren't getting results he wouldn't continue to post them.<p>3.  The author uses Wavii as an example of how TechCrunch is no longer a ""kingmaker"" because they've pushed that startup and it hasn't gotten major funding.  But said product hasn't even launched yet so it's really too early to receive more funding (they already got $2m in seed funding and that was only 9 months ago).  So the example doesn't really hold.<p>4.  I actually kind of agree with this point in that I don't really enjoy Paul Carr, Sarah Lacy or Steve Gillmor.  But again the site has analytics so I assume they'd be gone if everyone agreed with me.  So clearly they're drawing a crowd regardless of how I feel.  The author needs to realize the same is true of his opinion.<p>5.  The last point boils down to ""the author doesn't like Arrington so he'll fail"".  Well...a lot of people haven't liked Michael Arrington in the past and he's succeeded in spite of it.<p>I'm not saying Techcrunch doesn't have its problems but they're far from ""over""",1301739671

This is what the history shows.  That is, people have been doing well solving NP-complete problems well enough for decades without worrying about P versus NP.  So, learn some of what has been done, as I outlined and more, and then add to that material in ways important for your problems.<p>Just MUST realize that the question of P versus NP has been formulated in a way that makes it often shockingly far from getting valuable results in practice.  How can this be?  Heavily because the P versus NP question concentrates on the worst cases that can exist, and the average cases in practice can be much, MUCH easier.<p>For more, pay close attention to the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at Waterloo and Nemhauser's department at Georgia Tech.<p>Generally it will be tough for me to believe that the field of DNA biology has much knowledge of that material if only because very few people do.  Indeed, your desire for P = NP does indicate that your field lets the P versus NP question keep it from going after the field's holy grail, likely for no good reason.  Each protein you can correctly fold, each valuable molecule you can create, can be a big step ahead, even without P = NP.  Net, f'get about P versus NP.<p>Next, as I outlined, even if tomorrow someone shows an algorithm that shows P = NP, there is no guarantee that that algorithm will be 'fast'.  Instead, something with integer linear programming, touched up with various techniques, might solve nearly all your problems plenty well and be much faster.<p>Indeed, as in the classic Klee and Minty paper, the simplex algorithm is not polynomial but in practice it totally knocks the socks off the polynomial interior point algorithms.  To be more clear, classic simplex runs in 3m where m is the number of constraints and we get to ignore the number of columns.  So, classic simplex runs, in practice, faster than a polynomial of degree 1 in the size of the input data.  Still, it's 'exponential' in worst case.  There are more details on why in a classic paper by K. Borgward.<p>The polynomial algorithms for linear programming are way too slow for practice.<p>So, I'm not just blowing smoke here:  DO work on your problems but F'GET about P versus NP.",1301739483

I do however think that the quality has disappeared from techcrunch and 90% of the stuff that gets published on TC is tabloid crap.

2399614,comment,2379516,2390862,1,0,barrkel,,,".NET code <i>is</i> C++ code. The CLR is written in C++. In many ways this kind of argument is pointless, because it's really about a way of creating a piece of software, than particular to any one language. But some languages make life really hard here - in C++, you need to build a runtime.<p>I'll assert that memory is not normally a constraint in most situations that need to scale (i.e. not constrained clients), these days. (Though I will say I have noticed that Firefox 4 is significantly slower than FF 3 when switching tabs, and I believe it's because of memory reduction optimizations they've put in because of everybody moaning about bloat. I'd prefer it use more memory and less CPU.)<p>JIT optimizations like PICs? For over 20 years. The benefits are magnified in languages that make many operations virtual, so you see it in things like Smalltalk (very long time), Javascript (Chrome's V8) and Java JVMs (methods virtual by default so it's a win).<p>Re slow startup - you're deluding yourself if you think there isn't much software that doesn't have startup time issues. I need only restart any machine I have to know how slow initialization is; with HDD transfer rates in excess of 100MB/sec, there's no good reason for it to take more than 10 seconds or so when no hardware has changed. You're simply not aware of how much faster things could be if startup were faster because you're used to how slow everything is. You just know you can't e.g. fork utility X more than 200 times a second in a script, but don't realize it might be 10 or 100 times faster with a different approach.",1301738670

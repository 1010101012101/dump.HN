280524,comment,280395,280495,0,0,kylec,,,"You're right the price is the same - my gripe is how they attempt to obfuscate the true price by breaking it up into installments. When something is priced as X payments of Y (as opposed to the actual price, XY), there's an underlying assumption that I wouldn't purchase it at 1 payment of XY, otherwise why bother with the ""installments"" mindgame at all? Maybe I'm a overly sensitive to these sorts of indirections and concealments, but having to constantly expend energy to figure out how much something really costs can become wearing.<p>And yes, I do find the fact that gas stations price at tenths of a cent to be very dishonest - especially when they ALWAYS round up to the nearest cent.",1219165072

His PR person is probably freaking out.<p>Why would the board of directors just wait around for a clueless leader to drive them into the ground?<p>They lost the battle.

Build a nice home theatre that can sit 20 people and have showings of new releases.  The catch is they use equipment that is in the $1000-$5000 price range, and it's a great experience that you can 'take home'.  Delivery is free.  Installation is extra.<p>Show new movie releases.  Always have free popcorn!!  It costs virtually nothing.  Have a kids night.  Let local managers be more creative.<p>Still rent movies and games, but change the 'browsing' process.  Have large screens and use a wii type remote to navigate a virtual store with slick graphics.  Show what's popular, ask what type of movie they want.  Make a game that promises to find you the perfect movie.  Navigate through actors or scenes.  Remember what they have seen.  (how miserable is it to walk to the other side of the store with a movie and your wife says 'seen it' over and over again)<p>Make it so people don't say ""do we have to go to blockbuster?"" when they are in between movies in their netflix queue.\nIt's staggering to think that the idea of putting boxes of discs on shelves and letting people walk around aimlessly picking at random is",1219164987

Picking winners at a slightly better rate than the competition gives them an edge, even if they're not actually good at it. ie being ""barely competent"" at something extraordinarily difficult can often be enough to achieve considerable success.<p>Of course, I don't see any reason to believe that they aren't actually quite good at choosing winning startup teams -- it would certainly be interesting to be able to measure that.

So when I pull up these applications, I'm seeing what is (to me) a superior Internet experience.  Even Firefox on Windows, or PuTTY, just don't quite deliver what I like most.<p>And cross-platform applications are still platform-dependent.  For instance, I love Thunderbird on Linux...it works well.  On the Mac, however, despite using Thunderbird for months, it always felt a little clunky (e.g. emulated UI appearance, doing everything itself instead of integrating with OS services such as Keychain).

Do you think its a bad practice because it increases the conversion rate, or because it might convince people to buy something they can't afford? After all, its the same price, just presented differently. If you would buy at $120, paying 4 payments doesn't matter. If you wouldn't buy at $120, but can afford it, and are convinced by 4 easy payments of $29.99, its not like you can't do math.<p>At what point does a psychological trick become dirty?

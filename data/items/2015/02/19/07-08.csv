9072946,comment,9072069,9072608,0,0,jsprogrammer,,,"Ok, well now we&#x27;ve gone from two ill-defined terms to a handful of ill-defined terms: &quot;economic market or system&quot;, &quot;prices based on competition&quot;, &quot;private businesses&quot;, &quot;control&quot;, &quot;government&quot;, &quot;market economy&quot;, &quot;supply and demand&quot;, &quot;little&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think these definitions are that rigorous or well-founded, however I will accept that they represent a colloquial understanding of the terms however &quot;incorrect&quot; they may be. I say &quot;incorrect&quot; because I&#x27;m not sure you could use those definitions to point to real-life instances of what my understanding (and what I believe is implied in this thread/forum) of a &quot;free market&quot; is:<p><pre><code>   Entities exchanging *things*, free of coercion.\n\n</code></pre>\n>you should have no problem rebutting my position<p>Ok, so you&#x27;ve already signaled defeat...<p>> that a free market does not require equal distribution of resources among participants<p>To be clear, I never claimed that it does. I claimed that free markets don&#x27;t really exist. It is actually very easy to disprove my claim, it merely requires one to produce a counter-example, that is, point to an instance of a free market.<p>If you can provide a counter-example, I will respond, as I believe I will be able to show you a market that is (likely) rife with coercion.<p>What I claimed is that existing markets are typically extremely asymmetrical in regard to how information and resources are distributed among the participants. Most participants in the &quot;free market&quot; that is the USA have comparatively no information or resources vs. the largest participants. Additionally, many of those who lack information and/or resources are survivally dependent in some way on the largest participants which is typically where the coercion is allowed (or designed) to creep in. Some research[1] has found that even seemingly small amounts of asymmetry lead to large systemic effects. In the cited case, it was found that those who update their market strategy (who to bid against and at what price) fastest will cyclically be able to achieve much higher values of money than those who update their strategies at a slower rate. When you map these results to their real-world analogues, it is established participants (corporations) that are able to update their strategies faster (analytics, espionage, acquisitions & mergers, political purchasing) while individuals are unable to update as quickly. For example, I can&#x27;t really negotiate with and/or continually swap between competitors of: PG&E/AT&T/NBCComcastUniversal/TimeWarner/Verizon/etc/etc. To some extent I can swap (update my strategy), but not at the same rate that they are able to update theirs (for example, an airline can change prices on demand, multiple times per day). Typically I can&#x27;t even access historical market pricing, while the incumbents have access to (and exploit) almost all historical market data.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.3798v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.3798v3.pdf</a><p>Edit: If you are going to down-vote, please provide a counter-example.",1424332799

You certainly went into much more detail than I was comfortable going.<p>I completely agree with you (although wasn&#x27;t of course even aware of all the details, the company grew so fast during the last years). It&#x27;s all about ownership and communication, which are somewhat easier with someone next to you (with obvious caveats as well), but it&#x27;s far from black and white. Actually, remote in some ways makes it more explicit: you have to write stuff down, and thus, when you hire new people (or people leave) it&#x27;s more than tacit knowledge.<p>But yeah, it boils down to individual in the vast majority of cases, much more than whether the individual sits next to you or not.<p>“did you forget our Kiwi friend, our first FTE? he&#x27;s still here, rocking it.” Of course not, but he was a remote contractor as well through the early years :-)<p>Maybe that was one of the things that helped us to begin with: since all of the developers were remote originally, you just had to have the communication in place. I would imagine it&#x27;s trickier if there is an in-house team originally and then remote devs added to that.<p>Miss you too!",1424332133

As someone here already said, humans have been trained to look at symbols far less time than they were trained to look at real objects. As such, there exists a fundamental divide between perception of a symbol and the perception of an object (even if it&#x27;s a simulacra, not a real one). Marshall McLuhan outlined it best in his Gutenberg Galaxy, by separating letters (cold medium) from drawings (hot medium). As he was saying, perception accuracy varies between this hot and cold mediums, with hot having the highest accuracy, and cold the lowest.<p>Now, given this perceptual situation, I contend that given the nature of the digital medium, any kind of symbol used within it will be perceived as intrinsically cold by a given generation/cohort of users. I willingly shift my attention from the symbols to the users because I believe that they should be the true focus of the discussion. And the reality is that the very nature of the digital world and the understanding of its functionality and laws is a very high barrier to consumption for a lot of users.<p>My argument is way longer, but for the sake of simplicity, let me say just this: I believe that design should focus on advancing the understanding of the object that one uses. As such, I do not believe that expressive interface design holds all the necessary keys to that advancement, being that, in its intrinsic nature what it does is to simplify matters by simulating objects that the user is already familiar with. There are only so many ways to use a hammer and the representation of a hammer is contextually limited.<p>Minimalism is a temporary finish line. As the author noted, painters and sculptors in modern art have trekked across a very large conceptual space before arriving at minimalistic design approaches. Did this temporary finish line stop development? No, it generated a diverse set of reactions, with some painters re-approaching realism from different directions and some others exploring the limits of minimalist symbols.<p>I believe that &quot;flat&quot; design is just a way-point, and that having reached this way-point, there are myriad avenues now open to explore more in depth the semantic interconnection between symbols and humans.",1424330383

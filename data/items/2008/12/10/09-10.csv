Personally I am more worried about people losing their place to live, and ensuing conflicts over territory.<p>I also doubt that using food as fuel for cars happens only as an anti-global-warming measure. I suspect since oil is expensive, people are looking for alternatives. Although there might be subsidies and carbon taxes messing with the price.<p>Hm, now I am at 10 minutes and he is still talking about heat deaths. Not interesting (<hits stop button>).",1228902637

Nice to see implementations are growing up.<p><i>I guess it just seems much more elegant and simple to me to have only one kind of scope in the language... That's what's so awesomely simple about this language.</i><p>Block scope can be viewed as only one kind of scope. :-) If you try to define a language formally, function scope and lexical scope will be about equivalent on the simplicity scale: scopes will just be tied to code blocks instead of functions. (The scope nesting machinery is needed for closures anyway.) Implementation simplicity is also about equivalent: yes, blocks have to allocate activation frames only if they're needed, but same applies to functions once you get serious about speed.<p>The preference depends on your coding style. I find it intuitive to declare each variable in the outermost {} block that uses it, and not higher up; this intuition exactly corresponds to the formal concept of block scope. Many people naturally think like me, hence the huge number of Web articles complaining about the JS loop scope gotcha, calling it ""weird"", ""unintuitive"" and all manner of names. But as you say, to each his own.<p><i>A javascript engine would be crazy to try to shoehorn it into the language now, since it would, in fact, break a lot of code in the wild.</i><p>Yes. :-(",1228901977

Look how well their OS runs on low-end hardware.<p>I don't do client side programming anymore and I am _very_ happy with my Atom-based netbook for work. When I get home, I just hook it up to a giant monitor and happy I go.<p>And, BTW, Zope and Django run acceptably on it, so, I won't be seen migrating to a backbreaker notebook anytime soon.<p>I find OSX somewhat uncomfortable to use for me (a lot less than Windows - boy, why do people subject themselves to that?) mostly because it's Unix to a point and something completely alien beyond that. The problem for developers is the Unix half is very traditional 80's Unix and things have evolved a lot since that was cutting edge. I like my package manager to help me reassemble my box the way I want it to be and do so in servers in a repeatable way.<p>If your hacking is only around programming and reading Office documents and you don't touch system configuration at all, the Mac can be for you.

In wagers to win big you must either combine different bets with odds that pay as someone predefined. If you combine more, the need for luck increases. If you bet a large amount of money on high paying odds then again you need luck.<p>In contrary, foreign exchange you just trade the currency according to your prediction. The only way to automatically lose the negative lot is going off your margin. To win big, your prediction doesn't need to go against the odds like a soccer bet for example.<p>But, I will check out that book. Thanks",1228900645

8210327,comment,8206124,8210267,1,0,tel,,,"One way to look at this is that you have types which classify a structure/theory. In some sense, it works like this—you have generators which allow you to inductively define a large set of &quot;things&quot;, then you have laws which cut those things down.<p>For instance, the theory of monoids gives rise to the generators<p><pre><code>    zero : AMonoid\n    +    : AMonoid -> AMonoid -> AMonoid\n</code></pre>\nsatisfying the laws<p><pre><code>    zero + a = a\n    a + zero = a\n    a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c\n</code></pre>\nTypes can be refined and combined in principled ways by glomming the generators and laws together. Ultimately, what you&#x27;re looking for is a notion of the set generated by <i>all</i> of the generators satisfying <i>all</i> of the laws plus any &quot;coherence&quot; laws which help to define what happens when two laws interact.<p>Unfortunately, nobody is very good at this today. It&#x27;s a goal to be able to automatically achieve the above system in such a way that isn&#x27;t O(n^2) effort to encode.",1408665552

If you are going to put up a lot of HITs, especially if your HITs require special skills, you might want to put up some tasks and assign a special qual to the top, say 10 or 20% of the workers. Then you&#x27;d have a more limited group of workers, but ones that you know will do well. (Usually qualification tasks require workers to complete 10-20 of the HITs to get a good idea of the quality of work.) You might sacrifice a little bit of speed, but you&#x27;ll get better work.

The only other option (without spending a ton of effort to fight the system) if you want to graduate is to let Elsevier charge people money, a tiny amount of which they will forward to you (if you bother to let them know where you currently live).<p>> In the UK if you&#x27;re funded by a research council (like almost everyone is here), your thesis is normally open access because the public paid for it. Students are generally awful at disseminating theses and dissertations, but in theory it&#x27;s available for anyone to see (if only through library services). Whether this extends to copying and posting to Scribd I don&#x27;t know, but in principle I don&#x27;t see why it would be an issue.<p>In the US, most Ph.D.&#x27;s research is paid for with federal grants.  I agree that they <i>should</i> be open access, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay even more just so that other people could read my thesis.  Everything is in (non-open access) journals, so anyone who really cared about my research could just find it there.

An example that has been tested in a large society?<p>There are examples of self-organization to various extents, although there is obviously no example of a society exactly like what I propose. Many parts of what we currently consider the standard role of government have been done without government by many societies. What is considered the &quot;standard role of government&quot; changes quickly (it would probably sound ridiculous 200 years ago to say that Western states would tax something like a third of national GDP). Private arbitration is already quite common, and government courts are widely recognized as slow, expensive, and unreliable. International trade by definition has no higher level central body governing it, and that constitutes a decent chunk of global GDP. Decentralized mechanics already govern nearly all everyday transactions which are not worth the cost and unreliability of using government arbitration (restaurants generally try to satisfy their customers not out of fear of prosecution or litigation).<p>> It&#x27;s easy to propose theoretical alternatives with no regard for psychological or sociological effects (which are complex and therefore difficult to predict in theory).<p>In fact, the vast majority of my arguments revolve around psychological and sociological incentives.

I think you will find that getting elastic search up and running in Azure to be very easy.  As to your point about not worrying about scaling or management issues using ElaticSearch on Azure VM&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t agree with this.  There are so many things that you will still need to be concerned about.  For example, Azure will periodically do VM updates and patches which will cause your VM&#x27;s to occasionally be restarted.  This of course would affect your search availability which means if you can not permit downtime, you need to think about replicas across VM&#x27;s and how to manage availability groups so that the patches are applied in a way that you can avoid downtime.  Then you have to think about how you are going to handle partitions and how you will shard your index across machines in the case where you need more than one VM to accommodate the amount of data you have in your index.  All of these things and parts that we in Azure Search take on for you and make easy for you to scale up/down whether you need more replicas for higher QPS or higher availability or more partitions to allow for greater numbers of documents or faster data ingestion.  There is actually quite a lot more to managing a search service (even in a cloud hosted IaaS environment), but hopefully this gives you a few things to think about.<p>Liam",1408663902

Generally the way most &#x27;air breathing&#x27; engines work is that they take air, heat it (which expands it (thanks Boyle!)) and toss it backwards which imparts a forced in the forward direction (thanks Newton!). The difference in temperature between the inlet and exhaust temperature of a jet engine is a component of its efficiency. (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine#Energy_efficiency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine#Energy_efficiency</a> for some math :-)<p>But basically if you&#x27;re suddenly cooling air it gets smaller, which creates a lower pressure, and was used effectively in steam pumps to create the vacuum needed to lift water out of mines.<p>So the Reaction Engines concept takes really hot air that is compressed because it is being pushed out of the way by the air frame, then super cools it which causes it to become much smaller, and then dumps that into the engine. Which then heats it up again and pushed out.<p>If I understand the theory correctly, it takes heat from the air, removes it and puts it into liquid hydrogen (which then becomes vaporous(sp?) hydrogen) and then burns that hydrogen with residual oxygen to put the heat back into the air plus what ever is extra from the hydrogen. What bugs me about it is that it seems to double count the energy in the air rather than single count it. But I&#x27;m interested in seeing one of their machines in action. If someone knows whether or not there is a violation of thermodynamics in there I&#x27;d like to understand that.<p>That said a mach 5 vehicle with a range of 12,000 miles and a payload capacity of 15 tons has much more interesting uses than carrying passengers I think.

Here is how you calculate the unworldliness. You\ntake all of the known physical laws and write them in a special form. For example,\nsuppose you take the law of mechanics, F = ma , and rewrite it as F − ma = 0.\nThen you can call (F − ma) — which should, of course, be zero — the “mismatch”\nof mechanics. Next, you take the square of this mismatch and call it U_1 , which\ncan be called the “unworldliness of mechanical eﬀects.” In other words, you take\nU_1 = (F − ma)^2.<p>[...]<p>You continue to write U_3 , U_4 , and so on—one for every physical law there is.\nFinally you call the total unworldliness U of the world the sum of the various\nunworldlinesses U_i from all the subphenomena that are involved; that is, U = SUM (U_i).\nThen the great “law of nature” is<p>U = 0. (25.32)<p>This “law” means, of course, that the sum of the squares of all the individual\nmismatches is zero, and the only way the sum of a lot of squares can be zero is\nfor each one of the terms to be zero.<p>So the “beautifully simple” law in Eq. (25.32) is equivalent to the whole\nseries of equations that you originally wrote down. It is therefore absolutely\nobvious that a simple notation that just hides the complexity in the definitions\nof symbols is not real simplicity. It is just a trick . The beauty that appears in\nEq. (25.32)—just from the fact that several equations are hidden within it—is\nno more than a trick. When you unwrap the whole thing, you get back where\nyou were before.&quot;<p>[1] Feynman R, Leighton R, and Sands M. The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Volume 2, chapter 25, page 10.",1408662646

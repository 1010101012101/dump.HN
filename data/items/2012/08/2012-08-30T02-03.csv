I was just trying to preempt what seemed to be a logical reply given philwelch's previous comments.<p>As to why the market won't <i>necessarily</i> correct for it, is because many times overreaching management is effective (at least in the short term). Degrade working conditions to cut costs and the consumer benefits. The information about how these lower prices were brought to the consumer is usually lost in the process. That signal simply doesn't reach all interested parties, and thus they aren't able to adjust their behavior in response. Some situations it can work, for example a business where customer service is a large part of the experience.

Apple has been defending patents for inventions copied by people without a license and which are not standard essential.<p>Sure I can. Apple has been getting patents on obvious ideas that, often, they <i>didn't event invent</i> like:<p>- ""data tapping"" anticipated by both Netscape Navigator 2.0b1 (Live URLs in mail and newsgroup messages) and the Sidekick TSR from the 80s ( <a href=""http://www.articleonepartners.com/patent-research-community/threads/870-invalidating-info-on-apple-U.S.-Patent-N-5-946-647-to-shut-down-all-android-phones"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.articleonepartners.com/patent-research-community/...</a> )<p>- slide-to-unlock (anticipated by the Neonode N1m)<p>- universal search<p>And then Apple takes advantage of the weaknesses of the US patent system and uses these bogus ""patents"" as legal weapons against their competition. This is the same sort of chaos we would see if someone with a big checkbook decided to start trolling some of the many linked-list patents. What Apple is doing is just as bad (or maybe worse since Apple is more interested in market control than money).<p>> Basically it seems that to a lot of people since Google needed to rip off the iPhone for android, in order to compete, therefore patents are suddenly bad.<p>Just because you weren't aware of the history of software patent opposition doesn't mean it sprang up out of nowhere post-Android. Lots of people have been against software patents for a long, long time. Take a look at the history of the League for Programming Freedom, ""Burn all GIFs"", the Eolas web patent case, BTs hyperlink patents and on and on and on. Many have seen this nonsense and concluded that patents in software just don't work long before Android was a gleam in Andy Rubin's eye.",1346294165

But my experience is that pain is a signal you listen to, it's one of those things that says ""stop doing what you are doing."" It is a corrective force.<p>Making exaggerated claims about your influence or connections or importance to folks is wrong. It is wrong because it abuses the trust the other person put into the person lying, which then causes great hurt and shame when they realize they have been ""duped"" or ""fooled"" or ""lied to"". Calling someone on it, is hurtful too, but its important to do as well. That pain going the other way is a signal to moderate behavior, or change it.<p>So this conversation is ""Shirley is a liar"" / ""You shouldn't do that because it hurts her feelings""  seems to want to shut down a force working for good, which is better behavior.<p>I know I would love it if people were more honest about themselves, but I also know that some folks have convinced themselves that their own self worth is tied up in how influential they perceive themselves to be. Thus exaggerating that influence is like make-up, or fancy bling, its a crutch to prop up their self image.<p>I think there is pain on both sides of this conversation, at least a couple of kilo-snarks. If it helps someone to become a better person, its beneficial. But if they don't have the mental tools to process it they can (and sometimes do) become simply depressed by it. I don't think either party in this conversation represented themselves particularly well. If Shirley is young now would be a good time to come to grips with the way she presents herself. TC should work at doing better at informing rather than blaming (it did read like it came right out of Valleywag). Continuing acting this way on both parties will only hurt them going forward.",1346293833

As I understand the situation, the prospective employee thought he wanted the job when he went into the interview; but, during the interview he learned things about the place he'd be working in, and the people he'd be working with, that made him change his mind.<p>This is one of the main reasons that interviews are part of the hiring process:  So the company and the individual can learn more about each other before a firm commitment is made, and cancel the impending hiring at minimal cost before it's final, if it becomes clear that that would be the better course.",1346292939

Who knows?<p>I say Mark Shuttleworth <i>is</i> doing this, and no one is paying attention.  Unity <i>was</i> a unified vision, it was just different and no one wanted different.  And that is fine for a new target audience he wanted for the OS, which was <i>everyone else in the world</i>.  Look at what they are doing now, Ubuntu on tablets, Ubuntu TV, they <i>are</i> pushing a unified vision, and <i>nobody</i> is getting behind it en masse in the Linux community because it isn't everything they wanted.  They want Cinnamon, they don't like Gnome 3, where is my Gnome 2, etc.  The inherent strife is the proble, not a lack of visionaries.",1346292864

Manage most of the computing intensive tasks in whatever environment you like/need. Use Node to talk to APIs and render templates. With a well developed client framework you can even make only the first render in Node and the following in the client talking to the same APIs.<p>This leaves the most complicated back-end problems in the hands of developers that like and understand those problems and creates a friendly environment for the front-end developer who usually focuses on building features. The front-end developer even has already some experience with async code because of events in the browser, so he'll probably get up to speed quickly with Node.",1346292332

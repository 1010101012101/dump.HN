The API tier itself is stateless, but there are several stateful APIs and databases behind the API in question.<p>The team has an existing test suite of around 20 test cases that consists of Python scripts backed by a sort of QA-Team-produced SDK module for that API.  All test cases are at present performed manually.<p>My first assignment is to write a shell script that manually runs all the test cases (Python scripts) and displays friendly results while handling the shuttling of logs around the filesystem (all test cases write to the same log file in ./).<p>In the long run, I think Jenkins would be a good way to seat the scripts and their results in a web-enabled dashboard/HUD.  Also, I wonder if using a Python testing framework would resolve the need to maintain (NIH-style) all the scaffolding.  Would mock backends make sense here?<p>I&#x27;m eager to forge, once I gain a better understanding on the systems and existing testing methods, a more automated and efficient QA pipeline.

9861885,comment,9844806,9844806,0,0,kolyshkin,,,"[Disclaimer: I am the guy who was running OpenVZ since the very beginning, and if you hate OpenVZ name/logo, I am the one to blame. Also, take everything I say with a grain of salt -- although I know, use, like and develop for Docker, my expertise is mostly within OpenVZ domain, and my point of view is skewed towards OpenVZ]<p>Technologically, both OpenVZ and Docker are similar, i.e. they are containers -- isolated userspace instances, relying on Linux Kernel features such as namespaces. [Shameless plug: most of namespaces functionality is there because of OpenVZ engineers work on upstreaming]. Both Docker and OpenVZ has tools to set up and run containers. This is there the similarities end.<p>The differences are:<p>1 system containers vs application containers<p>OpenVZ containers are very much like VMs, except for the fact they are not VMs but containers, i.e. all containers on a host are running on top of one single kernel. Each OpenVZ container has everything (init, sshd, syslogd etc.) except the kernel (which is shared).<p>Docker containers are application containers, meaning Docker only runs a single app inside (i.e. a web server, a SQL server etc).<p>2 Custom kernel vs vanilla kernel<p>OpenVZ currently comes with its own kernel. 10 years ago there were very few container features in the upstream kernel, so OpenVZ has to provide their own kernel, patched for containers support. That support includes namespaces, resource management mechanisms (CPU scheduler, I/O scheduler, User Beancounters, two-level disk quota etc), virtualization of /proc and /sys, and live migration. Over ten years of work of OpenVZ kernel devs and other interesting parties (such as Google and IBM) a lot of this functionality is now available in the upstream Linux kernel. That opened a way for other container orchestration tools to exist -- including Docker, LXC, LXD, CoreOS etc. While there are many small things missing, the last big thing -- checkpointing and live migration -- was also recently implemented in upstream, see CRIU project (a subproject of OpenVZ, so another shameless plug -- it is OpenVZ who brought live migration to Docker). Still, OpenVZ comes with its own custom kernel, partly due to retain backward compatibility, partly due to some features still missing from the upstream kernel. Nowadays that kernel is optional but still highly recommended.<p>Docker, on the other side, runs on top of a recent upstream kernel, i.e. it does not need a custom kernel.<p>3 Scope<p>Docker has a broader scope than that of OpenVZ. OpenVZ just provides you with a way to run secure, isolated containers, manage those, tinker with resources, live migrate, snapshot,  etc. But most of OpenVZ stuff is in the kernel.<p>Docker has some other things in store, such as Docker Hub -- a global repository of Docker images, Docker Swarm -- a clustering mechanism to work with a pool of Docker servers, etc.<p>4 Commercial stuff<p>OpenVZ is a base for commercial solution called Virtuozzo, which is not available for free but adds some more features, such as cluster filesystem for containers, rebootless kernel upgrades, more/better tools, better containers density etc. With Docker there&#x27;s no such thing. I am not saying it&#x27;s good or bad, just stating the difference.<p>This is probably it. Now, it&#x27;s not that OpenVZ and Docker are opposed to each other, in fact we work together on a few things:<p>1. OpenVZ developers are authors of CRIU, P.Haul, and CRIU integration code in Docker&#x27;s libcontainer. This is the software that enables checkpoint/restore support for Docker.<p>2. Docker containers can run inside OpenVZ containers (<a href=""https://openvz.org/Docker_inside_CT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openvz.org/Docker_inside_CT</a>)<p>3. OpenVZ devs are authors of libct, a C library to manage containers, a proposed replacement or addition to Docker&#x27;s libcontainer. When using libct, you can use enhanced OpenVZ kernel for Docker containers.<p>There&#x27;s more to come, stay tuned.",1436493015

In order to achieve HA (backend redundancy) is there any way you can do it, assuming that nginx is caching the upstream dns values ?<p>You are correct. Kong supports either a DNS or IP address for a backend service, and starting from 0.5.0 it will be possible to add more DNS addresses or IPs per each API. That will make Kong work in load-balancing mode (<a href=""https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/157"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/157</a>).<p>> About performance, I can see you are advertising about 1000 r/s using kong<p>Kong is basically built on top of nginx (a very solid core), and it can achieve a similar performance to nginx because all the data requested from the external datastore is being cached in memory. So pretty much the latency it&#x27;s going to be nginx + Lua execution overhead (which is minimal, thanks to LuaJIT). I will run a better benchmark and write a blog post soon, trying to cover both single-node and multi-datacenter setups.<p>> and you need 3 machines for this (kong, cassandra, haproxy)<p>An external datastore (Cassandra - with plans to support PostgreSQL) is required because Kong has been built to scale multi-node and multi-datacenter in order to handle pretty much every use case and plugin/middleware. In very simple single-node use cases, Cassandra can live in the same instance along with Kong. I would say that in this regard Kong is inspired by a different philosophy (start small, grow big, even supporting hybrid cloud/bare-metal setups). Having an external datastore also means that Kong could support some pretty cool plugins, like multi-datacenter service discovery, API billing coordination, multi-region health checks, etc. For example today it is possible to rate-limit requests in an eventually consistent replication fashion across multiple data-centers.",1436492141

9861775,comment,9856855,9860139,0,0,xixixao,,,"This is a more general declarative vs imperative question so if you search for &quot;declarative  programming&quot;, you should find lots of examples. But here is one, taken from Bret Victor[0]:<p>Consider a classic drawing API:<p><pre><code>    // stem
    fill(&#x27;green&#x27;)
    rect(146, 60, 8, 200)

    // flower
    fill(&#x27;red&#x27;)
    circle(120, 30, 50)

    // leaves
    ellipse(173, 120, 40, 20)
    ellipse(123, 130, 40, 20)
    </code></pre>
Now, imagine we first wrote the code for stem and leaves, than later added the code for the flower (in the reference, copied it from elsewhere). The code has a bug in it - the leaves are red. This is just one example: once you have a &quot;hidden&quot; state, you have to manage it. You always have to be aware of the effects that every line makes on the state and how the state affects the other lines. A &quot;React&quot;-like (simply declarative) API would look more like:<p><pre><code>   stem = filled(&#x27;green&#x27;, rect(146, 60, 8, 200))
   flower = filled(&#x27;red&#x27;, circle(120, 30, 50))
   leaves = [
     filled(&#x27;green&#x27;, ellipse(173, 120, 40, 20))
     filled(&#x27;green&#x27;, ellipse(123, 130, 40, 20))
   ]
   plant = [stem, flower].concat(leaves)
   ...
   draw(plant)
</code></pre>
The code is now referentially transparent, I could replace uses of variables by their values and nothing would change, since the functions have no effects. The effects are pushed to the edge of the code, in this case the call to draw which actually performs the drawing, or when React updates the DOM with the results obtained from a render method.<p><a href=""http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming</a>",1436490650

This means that every elected official in The Free Human Government (FHG) will be responsible for equally serving the best interest of every living human beings.

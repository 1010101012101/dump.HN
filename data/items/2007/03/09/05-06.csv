3073,comment,2693,2693,0,0,bgold,,,"Careful with the wording.  WordPress isn't fully supporting OpenID, and this can be dangerous.  They're acting as an identity provider without also acting as a service provider.<p>It's true that WordPress users can use their blogs as OpenIDs to login elsewhere, but users who already have OpenIDs can't use them at WordPress.<p>Unless service providers implement the entire spec and treat all OpenID users as first-class citizens, regardless of identity provider, then there's really no interoperability here.  What's the point of an OpenID if you can't use it at other ""OpenID-enabled"" sites like WordPress?",1173419547

3066,comment,2987,3063,0,0,dfranke,,,"Dang, already?  Sounds like Arc is working out well.<p>Still, though, any statstical approach (which is what I assume you're using) is going to have some lag because you have to wait for a statistically-significant sample.  You can catch any given offender after he's caused an O(1) amount of trouble, but if the offenders don't correlate with each other, you can get overwhelmed by a sufficiently large number of them.  Spammers certainly do correlate with each other, but it's not obvious that voting rings do.",1173416801
3065,comment,2987,2999,0,0,pg,,,"We're actively trying to avoid the nastiness that seems to take over so many online discussions.  That's why there are fewer down-arrows here, for example.  I suspect that down arrows are more often clicked on stupidly than up arrows, that if you don't have down arrows you give people fewer ways to inject stupidity into the system.<p>I'll probably never get around to supporting bold text in comments either, for the same reason.  <p>To some extent news.yc is protected by being about a topic only a small number of comparatively smart people care about. With any luck we'll never have the full-blown trolls you find on general news sites.  I have some ideas for solutions if trolls do start to appear.",1173416604

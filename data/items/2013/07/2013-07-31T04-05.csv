6131999,comment,6131492,6131637,8,0,Decade,,,"There are various reasons that the legacy IPv4 assignments are not returned. At the normal rate of IPv4 address assignment, circa 2011 when IANA ran out, reclaiming all those addresses would have delayed address space exhaustion by maybe 2 years at most.<p>All it would have cost was unpredictable, unbound man-years of work as each organization tracked down each of their publicly addressable machines, not all of which were recorded, and vacated into smaller subnets of their address space. I&#x27;m sure you know of the servers that sometimes disappear behind walls during renovations. And some of the older machines require the kernel to be recompiled and rebooted to change their IP address. Ah, those were the days.<p>We just have to face the fact that IPv4 was not designed to be used on a network the size of the Internet. NAT and CIDR have stretched it out amazingly, but we&#x27;ve stretched it out about as far as it will go. We need to switch to IPv6.",1375246638

The UI is also not as big of a deal on a desktop. People don&#x27;t buy Quicken simply because it is &quot;prettier.&quot; Given the absurd number of different screen sizes, it&#x27;s much more difficult to make an app that will look good on each of them.<p>The second part is the API differences. You don&#x27;t get to use the latest fancy new features when 34% of your audience is on the older version. That is similar to windows land, but it is also not nearly as big a deal as the screen sizes.<p>Finally, hardware. Yes there is a lot of different hardware on desktops, but on average it is more powerful than on mobile devices. Ask anyone who has done embedded development, there are a different set of problems there than you have on the desktop. The same goes for mobile. Most of the new mobile devices have hardware on par with desktops from a few years ago, so it isn&#x27;t quite as bad as embedded. That being said, the range of Android devices is huge, and there is some percentage running on crap that creates another headache for Android developers.",1375246123

There&#x27;s a whole bunch of websites out there on shared hosting with dedicated IP(v4) addresses for their vhost just so they can use SSL certs for https connections. If we can ignore Windows XP users and IE6 users, SNI allows SSL certs on shared IP addresses - if I can think of a few dozen &quot;unnecessary&quot; IP addresses this little web development firm consumes, I suspect big hosting companies could probably find thousands or tens of thousands of similarly used IP addresses.<p>(Having said that, analytics still shows a startlingly high number of WinXP and IE6 users out there.

In larger cases, you generally don&#x27;t submit motions without talking to someone first either, and making sure it will go over well, or you don&#x27;t submit it.
Judges don&#x27;t want to see motions, for example, that just piss on the other side.<p>Here, they modified the requests to conform to law.  If they had been passed through FISC after not conforming to law, that would be a rubber stamp.  How can you suggest that telling people &quot;X is illegal, you&#x27;d can&#x27;t do X&quot;, so that they don&#x27;t submit the motion, is a rubber stamp.  The idea of a rubber stamp is that it doesn&#x27;t matter what you give them, they&#x27;ll stamp it.  Here, instead, they are doing exactly the opposite. They tell people ahead of time &quot;we aren&#x27;t going to stamp that&quot;, so nobody bothers.",1375244746

It will always be an issue in new technologies, there&#x27;s no easy to avoid it.<p>I&#x27;m still yet to find a good reason why there should be a blanket ban on software patents. There are many inventions which are simply not possible without software, but if you&#x27;re right, that invention is worthless. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d be quite happy for the first invention that uses two fingers to say open a mechanism, but now software happens to be involved, it&#x27;s completely obvious? What a joke.<p>My other problem with this whole &quot;Ban software patents because they&#x27;re bad because I say they are&quot; circlejerk that goes on HN is that you don&#x27;t see any of the good patents, you just look at the tentative/borderline/outright invalid cases. There are many inventions which are truly novel and inventive in the software world, but you choose to ignore them because of the few bad ones. It&#x27;s akin to saying all blacks are criminals because there&#x27;s a higher percentage in prison, or all Toyotas are shit because some of them had break problems. It&#x27;s just another form if gross selection bias, and you should be aware that there&#x27;s much more good in the system than the media would have you realise.",1375243342

I don&#x27;t really like most of the apps I&#x27;ve tried though, but the OS itself is pretty innovative compared to iOS. Love the app switching by swiping in from the right. The charms bar makes sense. Swiping from above to close an app is convenient. Search is good (but improved in 8.1). Most of all it&#x27;s really snappy. Of course I&#x27;m biased because I actually bought one. It&#x27;s the first MS product that impressed me for a long time. I like humble, beaten down Microsoft, I can feel they&#x27;re actually trying and fighting for their life this time around, and I think if people would just try it out instead of spewing the default hate for M$, they might actually like it too. I have a feeling it&#x27;s too little too late though, not sure if their business model can survive this decade. If Apple came out with an Air tablet that could be used as a laptop replacement, then that would probably be it for the surface and Windows 8.",1375243327

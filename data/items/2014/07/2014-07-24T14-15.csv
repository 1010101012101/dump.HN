You could subtly push the user along paths they have taken before and resist unknown paths.  With gentle enough vibration and enough use would you even notice the prompting?

I always find these things easier in person and I&#x27;d encourage you to be very very open & honest with your contracting boss about why you need an immediate exit.<p>A situation that might suit all parties would be for you to take a week off starting <i>immediately</i> (a mix of holidays earned and sick leave). That gives you a week to calm down, de-stress and stand back from the situation. Then you&#x27;ll be able to come back for a day or two to tie up any loose ends / train a replacement.

Here&#x27;s a counterpoint: Hiring and firing are a completely normal part of a business cycle. Every company should expect to have some ratio of hiring to firing. And yes, a firing typically means imperfect hiring practice (which is not the same as imperfect management) -- but here&#x27;s the key I believe you may not understand: The world is imperfect. We can bank on the fact that we make mistakes; we will always make mistakes.<p>Your other assertion that morale will suffer is empirically false. I know many folks at companies with this sort of practice in place and it boosts their morale because they don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re dragged down by under-performers. Maybe it lowers the morale of those who are under-performing, but that&#x27;s not exactly a problem, is it?",1406213326

In my personal opinion, a big reason why Copilot and Kiln never quite made it was that we didn&#x27;t have the developer resources to dominate the market when we were in a good position to do so.  Because we insisted on bootstrapping, we necessarily had very small teams, meaning that competitors, who were willing to go into debt to have larger teams, were able to come from behind and surpass us in both marketing and features.  In other words, while both products are successful and profitable, they likely could&#x27;ve been a lot <i>more</i> successful and profitable if Fog Creek had thrown a lot more resources onto them back at the beginning.<p>What you&#x27;re seeing with Trello is an attempt to avoid that happening again.  Trello is currently in a strong leadership position; taking VC now to secure that will pay for itself later.  While Trello could likely be profitable very quickly if Fog Creek wanted it to be, doing so would require a very small team bootstrapping itself again, meaning that Fog Creek could repeat the same mistake a third time.

The map was generated from the\n    relational matrix based on the citation, co-citation, and\n    bibliographic coupling formed by the nearly 20,000 publications\n    (journals and conference proceedings) registered in Scopus.\n    The map layout is based on a variant of a force-directed\n    algorithm using Noack’s proposal of an edge-repulsion energy\n    model. The interface allows the publications’ bibliometric\n    indicators and the cluster structures that they form to be\n    displayed based on their shared use by the authors of the\n    documents. To facilitate navigation, the interface automatically\n    positions the reference areas and subject categories which are\n    viewable via zoom-and-pan. The interface may be found to\n    constitute a useful tool for analyses of the Scopus publications’\n    presence in different scientific domains, and of the global\n    distribution of the publishing capacity of different countries\n    and regions. It uses the method of overlaying maps to locate\n    subsets of selected publications in the context of the global\n    publication structure.</code></pre>",1406210475

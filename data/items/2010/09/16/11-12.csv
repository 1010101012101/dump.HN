Really thrilled to see both supporters and critics of my view. One thing I do want to point out tho: The post was really meant to show one, alternative way of thinking.

That is what I think Apple is really good at -- and not just making pretty boxes for circuit boards.<p>Also, in the comments I made about a second mattering, it was exactly my point that while seconds are important to engineers, they may or may not be to <i>users</i>.

I said it's easy to decide you'll try to start a company (Microsoft was his second attempt) when you know that your future is ensured whatever happens (the first company went bust). I also said it's easy to be the biggest philanthropist in history when you also have the deepest pockets in history.<p>And no, I am unwilling to forget his unethical, borderline criminal behavior, his despicable disregard for the law and the damage he did to what was once a competitive, diverse and flourishing industry. Microsoft's monopoly (and the consequent lack of diversity) has set the advance of technology back years, if not decades. Like many HN'ers you call ""holier-than-thou"", I have lived - and worked - in the pre-monopoly years and I can tell you, from first-hand experience, the world is a much more boring place because of him.<p>He may donate all his money to whoever he wants, but that won't erase his past.",1284636149

If a better solution tests badly then, by definition of the word ""test"", you're not testing it properly. Whether or not the test candidates are ""obvious solutions"" or created by designers has no impact on whether testing is good or bad. Maybe someone can test whether testing tests better than not testing :)<p>I'm not saying that designers' intuition can be replaced by testing, I'm only saying that testing can not be replaced by designers intuition as the article implies. A designers' intuition, after all, hopefully comes from the experiences of informally testing out designs in real life.<p>What really annoyed me about the article was the attitude of ""We designers come up with brilliantly ground-breaking yet subtle designs, and if testing says there is a problem, then ignore the tests because we are always right.

1697443,comment,1696871,1697391,0,0,enneff,,,"We initially called Go a ""systems language,"" because we wanted to use it to build systems software. What we mean by that is high-performance networked programs that run on multicore machines. The kind of server stuff people traditionally use C or C++ for. Since Go's release last November, we've seen interest in Go from a lot of different places. There was the high-performance computing crowd that we were targeting, but beyond that we saw a lot of users of interpreted languages who craved more speed with the same ease-of-use.<p>We're yet to see which major niche Go fills, if any. There's a growing community of people from different backgrounds using it, and they seem to enjoy it. I personally think it's a lovely language to write all kinds of code in. I recently rewrote our continuous build client in Go, and I found it a cinch to write it in clear, reliable, maintainable way. It's definitely worth checking Go out because, even though it ticks a lot of the same boxes as existing languages, it's quite different from anything else out there in many subtle ways. Certainly for writing server daemons it totally kicks ass.<p>It's easy to get started. The standard library is featureful (<a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/</a>), and there's a lot of good documentation (<a href=""http://golang.org/doc/docs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/docs.html</a>). As for integrating with existing code, Go comes with a tool called  cgo (<a href=""http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/</a>) which allows you to write Go code that links with C code. It's pretty easy to use, and there are many third party libraries (<a href=""http://godashboard.appspot.com/project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://godashboard.appspot.com/project</a>) that use it. There's also Go support for SWIG for linking against C++ code.",1284635603

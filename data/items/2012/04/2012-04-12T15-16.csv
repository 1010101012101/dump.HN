One of the things she did was get some dolls for her son and, for a few hours a day, she would hide his cars to make sure the dolls got equal time. This lasted until one day she looked into a room where he was playing with the doll by running it along the floor yelling ""vroom vroom!""

""Let's take this offline"" is so common as to be a cliche, and if the speaker got flustered enough to get caught up in it, a decent moderator steps and makes that call. There are many reasons for this. One is that it's simply the polite thing to do. Another is that the audience may want to hear the talk rather than whatever particular point you're hung up on being the only topic of conversation. Yet another is that it's very unlikely that the speaker has absolutely nothing of value to contribute, so it's in everyone's best interest that emotions have a chance to cool down a bit rather than the speaker deciding he's never going to talk to that asshole from the crowd again.<p>We weren't at this meetup of course, but it very much sounds like that's what should have happened here and didn't.<p>I'd also point out to anyone thinking that being right is an excuse for this sort of behavior that people will remember you being an ass long after they've forgotten you being right.",1334246228

For that to happen, more ""high-productivity workers"" are required. Do they realize how hard it is to find talent in tech these days? The economy is ever evolving and becoming more efficient. There is really nothing new here, this has been happening for decades and centuries. With some adjustments, this article could be published 100 years ago and probably 100 years into the future.<p>One problem is that it's hard for people, especially at a certain age to adapt their skill set. So while some sectors are struggling to find employees, others have too many. It's the friction that is created by economy's evolution. But we have to look beyond the cold numbers. This is a social problem. With 8% unemployment rate, an unemployed person is not 8% unemployed, he is 100% unemployed.

I give and sit on presentations from other researchers, and I have even come up with a metric to express how many questions there are: MTTI, mean time to interruption. I have been in presentations with an MTTI of 1 minute. A typical presentation has an MTTI of about 5 minutes. A presentation with ""few"" interruptions has an MTTI of about 15 minutes.<p>Generally, questions come in three classes: clarification (""I'm not sure I understand, can you explain...""), discussion (""Have you considered extending this to...""), and criticism (""I think there is a problem with this approach...""). In an academic setting, all are welcome unless otherwise stated. (Sometimes we say no discussion and critical questions because of time limitations.)<p>However, what is never acceptable is someone commandeering the presentation and using it to talk about their own thing. Moderators will step in if it starts devolving like that.<p>So, simply, you need to let your audience know what the format is, because had I been in your audience, I may have asked questions, too.",1334245692

You need a correctly designed cryptographically secure PRNG which has had time to accumulate 100 or so bits of entropy (i.e., unknowability to the attacker). It's nice if it can be freshened every now and then with more entropy, but that really only should make a difference if you lose a backup tape and by some miracle the private key wasn't on there already. After it's warmed up, it should never need to block due to 'depleted entropy'. No one has ever broken such a CSPRNG. This is how the OpenSSL, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD /dev/randoms work.<p>On the other hand, what does tend to get broken regularly are overcomplicated and overengineered RNGs like this beast.<p>The one on the new Intel chips is handy, but it's largely overkill. We only need 100 bits now and then, not a steady rate at Gb/s (which can shut off abruptly when an attacker sharing your cloud hardware node decides to starve you of them). It's also not something that we can review for backdoors, so we should be reluctant to use it as the sole source of entropy.<p>A quantum vacuum random server is great like the way an internet-connected coffee pot is great.

Second, are you saying that portraying female founders in sexist terms is immaterial because whatever explains women being rare in tech has already taken effect after the age of 5?<p>That would imply that sexism in media only merits attention at all if children 5 or under can see that media.

There used to be three test/dev disciplines when I started (in 2001): ""Software Test Engineers"", ""Software Development Engineers in Test"", and ""Software Development Engineers"" (you likely know this already, but it might be useful history for others to know).  Around 8-9 years ago the STE discipline disappeared; the company hired for SDETs (like yourself) from that point on.<p>The big loss here was that now all STEs were expected to be SDETs - writing code on a regular basis to test the application.  There were (notice the past tense) many STEs who knew our application </i>very* <i>very</i> well, and knew how to break it, hard.  STEs provided quality feedback at a higher level than what a unit test provides - does the application feel right?  Are customers getting their solutions solved?  If you have your eyeballs stuck inside a unit test it's difficult to step 30 feet back and ask yourself if you're even doing the right thing.<p>Nowadays I feel like the pendulum is slowly swinging back the other way, and there is less drive to have test write automation (and maybe it is because where we are in the product cycle).  I understand that high-level STEs ""back in the day"" were probably concerned about potential career progression at the time, which might be why they eliminated STEs (I have no idea of the real reasons - they've been lost to Outlook's mailbox size limits), but all-in-all I think MSFT is poorer because of it.",1334243638

Those don't need Word. The inter-operation with other human beings who know and want to use Word, needs Word.<p>In biology (in government and industry) we use both. And we tend to use Word because that's what everyone else is using. But WordPerfect and LibreOffice generate TOC and figure lists, and track changes just fine. LaTeX and git also accomplish those goals. But the problem is working with other people in different groups, companies, levels of expertise, preference, etc. When track changes is breaking between LibreOffice and Word you just revert to using word to find the changes, and then incorporate them by hand into your LibreOffice document. Or, since you're using Word anyway and it does accomplish your goals, you just switch to Word.<p>Working in any setting aside from a self-contained research unit or the academic world, you just learn Word. In my case I learned Word and I use all of the various variable-esque and markup I can to make generating TOC, figure/table lists and references and adjusting values easier when working with people who just use Word because that's what you write reports in.<p>Even in an academic setting, if your advisers use Word (and prefer Word over dead trees) you're going to be creating Word documents for your thesis and academic papers (the journals mostly don't care because they re-typeset everything anyway) because you need their expertise to make your work awesome.<p>So, what about LaTeX? I like the idea more than the practice. Making basic changes (or what would be basic with CSS, Word, InDesign) to templates is mindbogglingly complicated to beginners. I'm not sure it's even particularly easy to create custom templates and formatting for experienced LaTeX users. However, once you have the Ecology, Washington Department of Fish And Wildlife, USDA, etc. LaTeX template all future publications for those is much faster.<p>If you want to know the actual one true solution to kill Word for academic, industry and government publishing it's this:<p>Modify Lyx (or make something like it using Markdown or reST) that uses sane defaults (I think WYSIWYM with a live preview is probably okay for everyone except the ""lost dog"" folks), some auto-correction, spelling and grammar checking tools and has the ability to easily and correctly make headings, adjust page headers and footers, footnotes, endnotes, and insert and edit figures, tables (the table formatting tools should be very powerful, ideally also the ability to include data from Excel and also tie into R, SAS and SPSS), images and variables (for things like n, p-value, species names) and integrate it with Evernote, Endnote, Papers, Mendeley and BibTeX (though, supporting BibTeX gets you pretty far). Now, make an extensive repository of formats for publications (like PyPI, rubygems, etc. but for templates from academic journals etc.) Ideally the templating should be powerful enough for experts to create anything they can imagine and simple enough that the Masters student studying the behavior of Little Auks can get her short fact sheet to look how <i>she</i> wants it to for her presentation to the Reykjavik Ornithological Society (using system fonts should not be difficult or require any amount of documentation reading).<p>Now you need to add collaboration tools. Track changes, highlighting, and commenting gets you to 90% of use cases for Word. Add in version control that is easy and makes sense, the ability for multiple people to live edit the same document and good merging tools (for multiple offline changes to the same document by different people) and suddenly your software is more useful than Word.<p>Oh, and it needs to be open-source, because us science-ey folks are increasingly grumpy about closed-source things, and we already have to buy the Microsoft Office suite to deal with documents and data from multiple different sources. It also can't be multiple gigabytes to download because I need to be able to tell my colleagues, ""Hey, you should use this, it's easier to make pretty things, and the collaboration tools are more useful than Word's.""<p>But even that only gets you the people who are writing for (essentially) print. If you have output formats that create sane, semantically correct and useful HTML (for people writing for online magazines, blogs and static pages) and HTML/CSS for people who want to use it as web publishing system you've got a tool that could slowly start gaining a foothold.",1334243186

The difference is because it's the surplus that matters for dating but the entire population for founding.<p>Suppose that 42.5% of the population are women in a marriage or committed relationship, and then by definition 42.5% are also committed men.  That leaves 10% of the population as single females and 5% as single males, and there's your 2:1 ratio for dating, created by just the small female surplus.<p>Would that hold for founding companies?  I don't think so.  Any of the 52.5% females could start a business, as could any of the 47.5% males.  The small excess of women doesn't create a 2:1 ratio here.

Contrary to the Luddites' fears, technological advancement did not ruin Britain's economy or systemically lower standards of living throughout the following decades of the 19th century. In fact, during the 19th and 20th centuries, the opposite happened, as technology helped Britain to become much less impoverished than before. For this reason, most economists think that the general Luddite premise is fundamentally fallacious, and thus they apply the term Luddite fallacy to it. Economist Alex Tabarrok summarises the neoclassical presentation of the possible fallacy as such:<p>If the Luddite fallacy were true we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries.""</i><p>But the Luddites then, and their modern equivalents, are making an emotional argument not a rational one.

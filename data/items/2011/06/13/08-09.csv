In the past the earth has been at times warmer than now and cooler than now.<p>Humans responsible?  Human are clearly responsible for some global warming:  E.g., light a match and warm the earth.  But humans clearly are not responsible for all the quite wild changes in climate in the geological record before humans even existed.  And it is tough to say that humans had much to do with the earth falling into the Little Ice Age or starting to come out of it.<p>Is current human activity significantly warming the earth?  I have looked hard yet seen no credible reports that it is.  No, I do not count Guru Ramaswami's 'radiative forcing' crapola at the center of the IPCC documents.  For 'climate science', that is nearly all just a flim flam fraud scam by a closed group of people pushing their orthodoxy to push their own careers.<p>I know; I know:  One of Al Guru's Yale profs liked to take vacations in Hawaii so put a CO2 sampling station there and has CO2 concentration data for some decades.  Then the screaming started:  ""CO2 is a greenhouse gas, will 'trap' heat and warm the planet, and we will DESTROY THE EARTH.""  BS.  CO2 only absorbs in three narrow bands, one for each of bending, twisting, and stretching of the molecule, and all three bands are out in the infrared.  Net, CO2 doesn't absorb much energy and is trivial, a nit, compared with water vapor, methane, clouds, etc.  The CO2 is just something to scream about.<p>My understanding is that the predictions of rapid warming by the 'climate scientists' over the past few decades never happened thus seriously hurting their credibility.  Heck, the 'leading climate scientist' back in 1970 or so (I'll save the time to look up his name, claims, and date -- but you remember, it was a 'Newsweek' or 'Time' cover story) about 'global cooling'.<p>For the article, it seems to have gotten the memo:  Don't talk about 'global warming' and, instead, talk about 'climate change'.  So, jumping in with the media, the article seems to go along with the suggestion that human activity has caused climate change has caused extreme climate this spring caused many more than the usual spring tornadoes in the US and, in particular, ones aimed at population centers, all without any serious, numerical, historical data on tornadoes in the US.  Sure:  ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, and PBS can get people up on their hind legs this way, but not me.  So, the screaming is just flim flam to stir up hysteria.<p>I have seen no ""organized disinformation campaign"", and you provided no evidence of one.<p>It's not about a ""campaign"".  Instead it's about the climate and solid evidence and science about the climate.  So far, net, 'no worries, mate'.  For the flim flam fraudsters, ROFL.<p>I used to debate all this nonsense on Reddit but gave up on Reddit and saw that mostly everyone saw that the global warming crowd was just pushing a fraud and quit listening.  So, I quit arguing.  So, I'm not going to dig out all my details on the 'radiative forcing' crapola at the center of the IPCC garbage, the NASA guy who makes so much noise, the good work done by the guy at MIT, the Hadley e-mail data, the 50 cent per KWH solar power in Germany, the wacko Al Guru graph that failed to notice that in the geological record from the Vostok ice core data the CO2 increased hundreds of years AFTER the temperature increased, etc.  The whole thing is dishonest science and a flim flam fraud scam.<p>I've got good news for you:  Relax.  F'get about Al Guru, Cap and Trade, shutting down coal plants and, thus, wrecking the US economy, the polar bears, the whales, the rising sea levels, etc.  Let the EPA enviro-wackos get real jobs and save the tax money.  Let Icemelt Immelt find something useful to do.  Let Al Guru find some more acolyte chicks to bed.  Tell the UN IPCC to go back to railroad engineering.  F'get about the fraud.<p>Give up on the morality play of human sin and evil and the classic dramatic trilogy of transgression, retribution, and redemption.  If you like that trilogy, then listen to Wagner's 'Ring' or 'Parsifal' or Tolkien's 'Ring' or 'Star Wars'.  Relax.  After all, it's just a movie.",1307954301

Consumer software works well when you use it, enterprise software looks good when you see it in a powerpoint presentation next to a feature checkbox, or hear about it on a golf course. Since no one making the purchasing decision will ever actually use it, you're pretty much guaranteed sales. Especially if you can pair it with expensive training that is necessary because your software is designed so poorly.<p>Having features is generally how you get through an RFP the purpose of an RFP is to CYA. Thus if you have the RFP approved by management and the proposal meets the RFP you're guaranteed a sale if no one else can check the boxes. If you ever get approved for an RFP you should immediately apply to become the vendor of record / preferred vendor for everything in that space guaranteeing more sales of your atrocious software.<p>Never design software that works in the enterprise as you'll lose out on massive support / training revenue. The worse your software is the better it will sell. Hopefully you can figure out how to sell software that doesn't actually do ANYTHING until they hire programmers to customize it. (I'm looking at you CRM vendors)<p>Once you've been through a couple of these things you'll understand how it works and how crappy software is incentivized by the RFP system.<p>You should also have an RFP template ready that contains all the features your software has so that lazy employees from megacorp can submit it for approval. Your sales people should be all too ready to help the employee out with this task so that they have a very professional and tailored RFP. Now that they don't have anything to do that day you should take them out for a beer to celebrate how fast they submitted the RFP to management.

Typically enterprise UIs has dozens of input controls, not because the Developers suck but because they need a lot more input than the google search page, a media player or something like that. Touch Interfaces will always suck in those cases, and HTML5 is still far away from handling those beasts in an elegant way.",1307952574

I've always felt that the only barrier to providing this service was a critical mass of drivers and zipcars. Most cars are currently idle for the majority of their lifetime, taking up a lot of parking space. Imagine if the streets were lined with shared cars instead of privately owned cars. Once you get to a certain density you should be able guarantee availability in all but the most remote locations. There are large scale migrations like commuting that take place over the day/week but the availability of cars should match this. \nGiven a rising population density it seems inevitable that such a service will have to exist as we will run out of storage space for idle cars.",1307952512

Corporations are all about speed and efficiency and to compare .Net vs HTML5/Javascript is insane.<p>I've been programming in .Net for years now, but recently as I got new projects I figured to use them in HTML5/Javascript instead. But after countless of hours research it turns out .Net is by far the most efficient and only option in terms of speed and most direct relation to the hardware, which was important for my projects. They both play a part and neither should be ruled out. Using HTML5/Jquery for web projects and .Net for projects which requires quick access to local resources. Two different worlds. \nIf I were Microsoft I would focus fuse those two worlds together. And if they can add 1+1 this is their intent.<p>The developers and corporations will continue to use whatever means to maximize profit with the most efficient way for their app. And the corporations in whole is who steer the direction of the consumer market in the end. Not one or two companies. \nCorporations use .Net not because Microsoft tells them to do so, but because it is most the efficient.<p>From a consumer point of view it might not be so easy to understand how these things works, as all you see in media is Microsoft that and Apple that and then one might think that's all there is to it.",1307952354

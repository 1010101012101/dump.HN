In a startup or other type of company, there are attributes separating ""best"" from the rest. The process superstar from MegaCorp might destroy a startup!<p>At the end of the day, management adds value when they take a bunch of people with a base level of knowledge and helps them deliver whatever the product is that is being developed. The trick is finding folks with good work ethics who have the base level of knowledge that you need. There's no magic.",1304355588

Successively hiring only people equal to or less than the current skill level within the company inevitably leads to a gradual lessening of talent within the company.<p>(2) How will you stop the talented staff leaving? By hiring untalented people you shift more work onto the most talented. Since they also probably don't want to work in a place that is known for hiring people without talent they're going to be very likely to leave. This will exacerbate the brain drain within your company.",1304355572

There are a lot of things we are surely missing out by not moving to the Valley, which is the startup ecosystem, the investors, the talent etc. But startups also have to deal with the noise, the saturation, and the ""meh"" when you launch. Where as in Richmond, we can possibly have a far bigger impact, with a lot more people who will love us, and we are right next to DC.<p>I am sure we will not know if we made the right choice, for a long time.

This is the rate on the next dollar of ordinary income (and the number you use if you wish to maximize your claimed tax rate). The claimed capital gains number of 27.63% is 15% plus that same amount for state and local taxes, which do not treat capital income differently (the .62% on the end of both is the giveaway). Neither of these numbers is an <i>effective</i> tax rate (=tax actually paid/pretax income), or ""tax pressure,"" whatever that is -- at my guess, Mr. Wilson probably pays effective tax in the 30-40% range, depending on how much capital gains he realized in the year.<p>On capital gains rates generally, tax does work on the margins, but this means that we should worry about what kind of investments are incentivized by lower capital gains rates. I seriously doubt that a Mr. Wilson taxed at the regular income rate for capital gains would put even one fewer dollar into his fund, making 20+% pretax, if his other choice were, as he says, the mattress making 0%. Even at equal income and capital gains rates, the incentive to maximize your returns is pretty strong, so the idea that the differential rate is changing behavior in a useful way needs more analysis than Mr. Wilson gives it.<p>For corporate taxes, effective rates are indeed what matters when comparing tax burdens since corporations get such a variety of credits; that said, the fewer deductions/lower rates tradeoff is free economic growth and we should do it (it'll never happen, though, since congress is too dysfunctional).<p>And last on ""double taxation"": gopi is right that most corporations are organized as passthrough entities -- they pass all income through to their owners, who then pay tax on it. Those that aren't do have lower taxation of dividends to make up for the equivalence of share buyback and dividends.",1304352647

2506695,comment,2505882,2506510,6,0,latch,,,"How do you test code that relies on the current time in C#/Java. I've seen a couple solution. Injecting some type of abstract Clock/SystemClock everywhere being common. C#'s lambda's let you do something nicer, like:<p><pre><code>  class SystemTime\n  {\n    public Func<DateTime> Now => () = DateTime.Now;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nUltimately though, you're having to work around the fact that Java and C# are class-oriented, rather than object-oriented. Classes are useful - they serve as a template for your object, but in most (all?) dynamic languages, the class itself is a living, breathing, modifiable, runtime object.<p>What does all this mean? How do you get the current time in a testable manner in Ruby? Use Time.now. You don't implement patterns or change your code. You don't fear the evil static..because really, it isn't a static - we don't even call it a static. It's just another method on another class, which we can rewrite at runtime as need be.<p>How do you stub it? Well, using a mocking framework:<p>Time.stub!(:now).and_return(Time.local(2011, 5, 3, 0, 1, 22))<p>The mechanics of how this is internally done isn't too complicated once you know about Ruby's metaprogramming (which probably takes around the same amount of time as getting familiar with C# or Java's reflection capabilities).<p>I know, it's a simple example. But it's surprisingly common. And I find it a little ridiculous that to get the time, we need to start creating interfaces and injecting parameters. While C#'s lambda's largely solve this problem, move to something just slightly more complicated, and you're back at square one.<p>I dunno, not sure if that explained it without being condescending. I'm tired...that stub is actually returning a pretty accurate time for me.",1304352114

Amazon employs fewer sysadmins per server than your ""regular"" datacenter would.  That saves money when things go well, and it means there aren't enough sysadmins to fix things quickly when the excrement hits the air circulation device.  That's a hidden systemic risk factor that you should be taking into account - but you aren't.  It's really exactly like finance.

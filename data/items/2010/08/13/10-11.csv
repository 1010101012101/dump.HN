If not, read it, throwing more bodies at the problem will not solve it.<p>2) Your team already sounds quite big for a supposed 5 month project. Feels like people will be stepping on each others toes, and someone will be tearing ther hair out trying to manage everyone modifying the same codebase whilst it is so immature.<p>3) The Iron Triangle - this is the relationshp between scope, resources/cost, and deadline dates. If you can't build what is in scope, with the resources you have by the date specified then somethings got to give. Hint: increasing resources is the least effective way of doing this, see 1) above.<p>4) Have you tried approaching this in an Agile manner? Prioritise all the functionaltiy thats in scope, tackle the most important first. Continually refine the priority of functionality as you develop the system. If that deadline is immovable, and you're not going to get all the functionality in, at least you've delivered the most important parts of the system. What you might find, if everyone gets Agile, is that they realise you won't hit the deadline early on and they start buying into this approach, by prioritising they are in effect reducing scope without realising it.<p>5) in conjunction with 4) monitor the productivity and efficiency of your team using burndown charts. Note that this is different from speed of development. The concept of technical debt is integral in all of this; productivity & efficiency take into account technical debt and implies you are trying to manage it, speed usually increases technical debt.<p>6) Finally, tell people ""things take as long as they take"". Just because someone says they want it by yesterday doesn't mean that it can be built by then.If they want to bake some bread it will take them approximately an hour or so, if someone told them to do it in 20 minutes they wouldn't be able to knead the dough and bake it in that time - and get something edible at the end. Essentially that is what you are being asked to do.<p>My two-penneth<p>Good luck!",1281696563

But then I didn't. Partially this was because of assorted conceptual and administrative issues, but partially it was because I realized how burned out I was. I'd been living this thing for five years, breathing life into it as part of a very small team, starting with literally no budget. Business is hard, and it was often soul-destroying - I discovered that other people were considerably more cut-throat than I was willing to be, and consistently underestimated how low people could go. And on top of the business itself, I was up to my eyeballs in code most of the time. Over time, I lost perspective. Within a space of a couple of months, though, two immediate family members were told they were seriously ill, and my sister became long-term disabled, and I was snapped back to reality.<p>It wasn't that entrepreneurship wasn't for me, as such, I don't think. It was that the specific kind of entrepreneurship I was living didn't fit my hopes or goals, and was eclipsing everything else in my life in a very negative way. I didn't think I could fit the care-giving that would potentially be required with the demands of the job. They're still going strong, but I wanted to live a different kind of life, closer to what Tony Stubblebine writes about on his blog. (Tony's the smartest guy I know on the topic.) That was always my intention, but we diverged.<p>It's certainly positively affected my career. Since leaving, I've spoken at Harvard, been published by IBM and have worked in a bunch of really interesting situations, with fantastic people, on a consultancy basis. Before the startup, I was a ground-level developer, so that's a win. But I'll certainly start a company again, at some point, if only because I'm the kind of person who loves to make things, and to do things on my own terms.<p>I'd ask yourself carefully if it's entrepreneurship that's not for you, or the situations you've been in.<p>(By the way, my family's health situation is vastly improved - but I think the thought experiment of what would happen if you needed to be a care-giver is a good one.)",1281693993

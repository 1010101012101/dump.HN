2221169,comment,2220917,2220917,0,0,jmspring,,,"One thing to remember, especially when considering the discussion of C++ at Netscape, it took awhile for most compilers to implement a consistent set of the C++ features.  Netscape was being built across a dozen or so platforms and this was a major concern.  If you have built Mozilla recently, the process to do so is not a couple of click action it is somewhat involved.  It was worse way back when.<p>I've used C++ at the last for companies I have been involved with.  The only consistency has been that no place used the same subset of C++ features.  It usually boils down to what subset the team members are comfortable with.  Variations have included exceptions or not, whether or not to use multiple inheritance, STL or Boost (yes, boost isn't really part of the C++ standard, but things like shared ptrs are in TR1), whether or not to use TR1, etc.<p>I personally don't have a strong opinion, but there are people that abuse C++ in ways that produce lousy code -- classes as a way to have nearly global variables, the whole C with classes approach, etc.<p>You really should use the right language for what you are working on and that plays well with any libraries you may want to use.",1297778385

2221167,comment,2220917,2220917,0,0,cletus,,,"The real shame about C++ is that it's the only mass market C-level language with advanced features built on top of it. Don't get me wrong: I agree with the author and his interviewees. I think C++ is a horrible language for the very reasons described: everyone uses a different subset of it and it's <i>hideously</i> complicated.<p>For a more current view, see Linus Torvalds' comments [1] [2].<p>What I would like to see is a language very much like C (being low-level) with a <i>few</i> features built on top. What those features are I guess is the real trick.<p>One thing I like about C++ is the constructor/destructor mechanism. It's very explicit. The trend now is towards garbage collection (which, admittedly, you can implement in C++). This is a trend I largely agree with. It's quicker and cheaper to write software that way (IMHO). But there is still a place for simper schemes as all GCs I've come across have issues.<p>One thing I think such a language <i>shouldn't</i> be is object-oriented. To quote Joel Spolsky [3]:<p>> A lot of us thought in the 1990s that the big battle would be between procedural and object oriented programming, and we thought that object oriented programming would provide a big boost in programmer productivity. I thought that, too. Some people still think that. It turns out we were wrong. Object oriented programming is handy dandy, but it's not really the productivity booster that was promised.<p>Or at least such objects should be very limited in scope. Linus addresses some of the reasons for this, such as knowing which function is being called by simply looking at a code snippet (typically a patch in his case).<p>When writing low-level code I certainly do <i>much</i> prefer C over C++. But having the tools to build automatic reference counting into C would be really nice at times.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57643/focus=57918"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57643...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&id=110618&threadid=110549&roomid=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html</a>",1297778379

Of course, if I've misunderstood that part, then ignore what follows.<p>In a real world scenario (English language), since words share so much structure, this only grows as O(N). [1] Although the top 1000 recently searched items might not share as much structure, that is a trivial amount of data, even for O(N^2). The storage overhead on a trie is high, especially as many bigrams don't occur in English, so array-based tries necessarily waste space.<p>You're right that the lookup time is killer though.

2221131,comment,2206450,2207296,0,0,Rhodee,,,"- How much: Industry specific and tenure. I would say the expected start salary undergrad in one of the major cities is 38-42, master's level candidate start in the 50s and with tenure you tap out in mid six-figures. Or you go work for the government, lobby shop (don't) or for an elected official. You can head to the undying lands and teach. Lots of flexibility, but very hard to pin down what exactly it is 'you do.'<p>- Skills: PhDs are not required-you will find more JDs in the fold than one might expect. These shops are often very small and run by older guard and don't have access to HN-audiences, so they are not technically advanced or pay exorbitant rates for graphic design and web presence (arbitrage alert). But what they are good at is proposing ways to change rules. Politicians, rarely, rarely, write laws-this community does. Politicians pull language from us and write bills. Then there office turns those bills into legal language.<p>So the skills you would need to support those outcomes at any level IMO: Statistics, hitting the phones and a business development acumen. You can be the smartest person in the room, but if you can't move people to do something (hint: statistics is not 'it') you will be like those people who build the perfect product that no one buys. There needs to be an MVP for policy. Too many perfect bills, too few changes in our lives.<p>-Why I left: I have a very impatient mind. Well sort of impatient-I did work in the field for seven years. I realized that the field adapts to politiking in ways I was uncomfortable with and without a lot of what we would call 'validation.' Ideas would be dropped wholesale given regime change or funding-which was not connected to reality. I worked at an org that was 'policy effective' they knew how to resist such changes (i.e. funding) and hired smart people. But I realize I was the only talking about rapid iteration, validation and business development-which got me strange looks. I've always loved coding, and wanted to start a social enterprise-so I walked out and am doing just that.<p>If I were giving tips to me in my twenties I would say:<p>Steer clear of small shops that don't want to support projects in the field. If they think small does not equal nimble (i.e. they just want to put out reports or convene meetings), its not worth your time. In fact if someone tells you they want to convene a meeting-always follow up with...then what? If its another meeting...head for the hills. Meetings are important but if all they do is create additional meetings-you know you are dealing with the old guard and change will be slow.<p>Think tanks are all wishing to become, at least in part, communications firms. Too many organization's chasing too few minutes in the day to influence you-message inflation. If your organization begins to show signs of leaping into the bubble, leave.<p>Work on policy that can be practised. Some might think that means work at a large scale. Wrong. Find a shop willing to test its ideas in the wild-you will not regret this policy entrepreneurship experience.<p>Rhodee",1297777647

Your test framework also looks custom built (aside: IMO UnitTest++ would have fit you style). I think if you just changed class data to structure and member functions to accept structure pointer, you would get a nice C representation (almost every class I looked at had an Init method). In effect you are using C++ to avoid very small boilerplate code in equivalent C program.<p>No wonder you find C++ pleasurable, you are using it as C with classes! However, if you are working on an existing code base with mix of STL, boost and bunch of other libraries, you would start feeling pain of using C++. In my experience, every library author uses a different subset of C++ and as an application writer, you often have to grapple with the glaringly different idoms in your program.

But I think there isn't a viable competitor in the ""C, but better"" space at the moment. Go is probably too high level to be a complete replacement. D is... a weird case. I don't think it stands much of a chance in the market because it's not sufficiently better than C++. Overcoming C++'s momentum is extremely difficult at this point.<p>EDIT: downvoters: if you think I'm trolling, please note that I've written more code in C++ than any other language. <i>I would love a ""better C"" that's universally better than C++</i>. If you disagree with my points, please elaborate.",1297774843

9777023,comment,9776613,9776877,0,0,andmarios,,,"In Greece we have a solution for this, as old as Uber but that works with the taxi drivers instead against them.<p>Taxibeat is an app you can use to call taxis from your smartphone. You may choose which taxi you want from the list of nearby drivers. For every driver you see his/her name, plates number, car, reviews, whether he permits pets, speaks foreign languages, has wifi, permits smoking, can help people with disabilities etc. Also you can pay with paypal or credit card.<p>When you take a ride, taxibeat&#x27;s driver app essentially monitors the ride.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that since the taxi drivers that choose to work with taxibeat know what a smartphone is, know about reviews etc, they are in general very professional and I never had any issues with them, in contrast with the rest. Of course that they are accountable to a company that takes seriously its name, also helps.<p>The idea went so well that now we have a competitor too, taxiplon, which also works with phone calls.",1435229847

It fell great I lasted about maybe 4-5 days then kept messing up. It&#x27;s best to do it with a partner to keep you up. They say to do something productive to keep you going, but when I tried to be productive I was craving sleep. And the fact that I was doing it alone didn&#x27;t help. That&#x27;s why they say do it with someone, because you can have a convo and keep each other up. Good Luck anybody who goes for it. The only reason people stop other than how hard it is, is simply that everyone else is on a &quot;8hr sleep cycle&quot; I quoted that because most people don&#x27;t really get that much sleep. Point is the rest of the world is on a monophasic sleeping cycle.",1435229728

Depending on the show, the latter may not make any sense, or require significantly more investment to get an acceptable result, and it divorces the translation from the original to a much higher degree.",1435229692

You can slam geometry through the graphics card above that rate, but some of those frames won&#x27;t make it to the screen.  30 FPS is not great, but it can be better than having wildly variable framerates.  Consistent 30 FPS is better than traditional films, which mostly ran at 24 FPS.<p>Now, for a fast-twitch action game, processing input at 30 FPS is  unacceptable; input lag sucks giant donkey balls.  But I would expect that a AAA development studio knows that running input-handling, networking, physics, AI, etc in lock-step with the rendering loop is not the smartest idea.

9776950,comment,9775909,9775909,0,0,bemmu,,,"This is my story basically.<p>I started getting interested in anime in mid 90s. I set up dial-up Internet (Trumpet Winsock on Windows 3.11!). I met this guy from Germany online who had somehow managed to get Ranma 1/2 on VHS tapes, which he graciously agreed to mail to me in Finland. I knew a guy who was into video editing, so he had the setup to be able to copy them so I could mail the tapes back to him.<p>From there it took many years before I knew enough Japanese to be of any use to anyone. But once I started to get there (and with a ton of help from my now wife), I skipped the fansubbing part and instead made a demo manga translation and sent it in a professional looking folder to two companies who were doing the official translations. I thought it was worth the shot, but didn&#x27;t really expect a response. But to my astonishment BOTH agreed.<p>Soon I found myself regularly visiting the publisher for new work and had a professional translator as my mentor. I was getting paid to translate manga, it was my dream come true.<p>But after the dream ended the hard work started. I was surprised by the speed at which I was expected to translate these books. I was supposed to do 2-3 books every month! Take a look at a manga, see how many pages there are and you are not just translating the dialogue, but also explaining all the sound effects floating in the background.<p>Around this time social networks started releasing their APIs and I got into that world instead and left the translation work for others. That was a great choice, as I started making WAY more money doing that than I ever could have with translation.

If not, I recommend dropping pixel art for a few weeks, picking up a good book by Betty Edwards or Andrew Loomis (both can be found as pdfs online), and filling a couple sketchbooks.<p>To make good pixel art, or any other kind of art really, first you must learn to see shapes in a particular way that&#x27;s not intuitive for non-artists. It&#x27;s a bit hard to explain in words, but if your mind hasn&#x27;t learned that trick, your shapes will always come out wrong and you won&#x27;t know why. Sketching allows you to learn that skill quickly and easily, while pixeling has so many distractions that IMO it&#x27;s almost impossible to learn from pixeling alone.<p>With the right approach, as described in the books I mentioned, most people see obvious and major progress after just a day or two. I&#x27;m not exaggerating at all, it took me literally one day of sketching with Betty Edwards&#x27; book to go from &quot;I can&#x27;t draw, it must be genetic&quot; to &quot;I can draw anything right if I look hard enough&quot;.",1435228104

So how much thought was put into the effectiveness of the weapons being bought? The procedures of checking cars? The method by which locations of checkpoints around sensitive areas were determined?<p>The death of people being killed by bombs was the result of the complete ineffectiveness of these &quot;bomb detectors&quot; only to a very little extent, but likely mainly because the whole organization responsible for safety was unable of rational thought and planning.",1435227010

Highly visible engineers and managers lost to do their own thing, Spotify and other companies.<p>The about screen lists engineers involved, that has changed dramatically as well.

9776877,comment,9776613,9776613,0,0,antimagic,,,"I feel that every time this issue gets discussed, it needs to have some background information provided, because quite frankly, taxi drivers in France suck.<p>From my own personal experience, I have had the following incidents:
1) a taxi driver that took me the long way round from a train station to my home.  Thinking I was a tourist, because of my accent, he basically tried to take me for a ride thinking I wouldn&#x27;t notice. That lifted the bill by 50% compared to the usual price.<p>2) A taxi driver in Marseille that wouldn&#x27;t finish the trip until I gave him my phone number.  My choice was to either get out in the middle of one of the roughest neighbourhoods of Marseille and try and find another taxi, or hand over my phone number (which he <i>verified</i> by calling me on it before continuing) - I had to change my phone number after that one.<p>3) Countless occassions of having taxis refusing to take me as a customer because I wanted to go to a part of the city they didn&#x27;t want to go to.  One particular occassion struck me as bad - I had the car door open and one foot off the ground when he realised where I wanted to go and took off.  Considering I was a lone 35-yr old woman at the time, dressed in a business suit, he obviously wasn&#x27;t worrying about his safety.<p>4) I have a friend who actually works in the Boers (mentioned in the article).  When I&#x27;m out with him, he won&#x27;t let me get into a taxi until he&#x27;s checked the guy&#x27;s (most taxi drivers are men, and on the rare occassion I&#x27;ve had a female driver, they have been nothing but professional - make of that what you will) papers <i>and</i> flashed his badge to keep the driver on his best behaviour).<p>5) If I move my grievances out to people one removed from me (ie people I personally know), you can add in a guy getting physically hauled out of a taxi and beaten by the driver because the driver didn&#x27;t want to go where he wanted, another guy getting hit by a taxi when walking across a pedestrian crossing, only to have the taxi driver get out of his vehicule, abuse and kick said friend for slowing him down, and then driving off, and a taxi that took off with a friend&#x27;s luggage in the boot, which he never got back.<p>So yeah, I have about zero sympathy for French taxi drivers - the sooner they&#x27;re run out of business, the better.  Their latest behaviour has just confirmed for me that I won&#x27;t ever be using one again if I can avoid it.",1435226657

Maybe parts of Java were influenced by Objective-C, but surely there is very, very little left of the philosophy behind how you write Objective-C code. In fact, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s almost no similarity whatsoever.<p>In terms of how you program, Java is a lot more like C++, minus half the language features that make C++ both powerful and dangerous. Obviously there are fundamental differences, but I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that someone switching from C++ to Java would have a much easier time adjusting, then going from C++ to Objective-C.<p>Also, I find the qualification of Objective-C as a &#x27;mutant of C&#x27; a bit off the mark. Yes, Objective-C is a superset of C, it&#x27;s built on exactly the same foundation, but the end result is and how you use it is completely different in almost everything except the syntax of the pure C-constructs and fundamental types.",1435226489

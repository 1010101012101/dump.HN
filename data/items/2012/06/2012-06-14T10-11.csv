And I think there is a possibility that he is in a position to learn the hard way (in a way he will not forget what he learnt) some of the nasty parts of software development: code base is awful, touching one thing breaks unrelated parts, doing a simple change takes days because of duplication, PM do not care a shit if code is clean or not and don't want to hear about refactor. All of that is crude reality.

Firefox and Chrome come out of the box with more or less the same features as Internet Explorer 6, which is stone-age browsing for me. Sure, you can add extensions and add-ons but they (at least for Firefox) slow down your browser, take time to set up (unless you use a portable version you carry everywhere with you), may be a security risk (as history has shown) and are nowhere near as refined as what Opera provides (I really disliked the All-in-one gestures add-on in Firefox, although you can still customize it until it somehow behaves like Opera's implementation, sort of). And really, Opera has so many features that I like it would take a very long time to have an identical setup for Firefox. Maybe someone should develop an 'Opera' extension.<p>> I prefer being able to pick-and-choose features<p>What does it matter if you don't use those features and they don't get in the way? For instance you have a torrent downloader embedded in Opera. I don't use it, I never see it, it does not slow down my browser.

The application is very operations focused. We are unsure of how to structure the web services to best fit with iOS and would love some advice. We are also interested in how to manage the synchronization process within iOS.<p>Without going into detailed specifics, the application allows the user to estimate the costs of work at a remote site. These costs are broken down by room and item. If the user was an internet connection this data can be sent back to the server.<p>Multiple photographs can be taken of each item, but they will be held in a separate queue, which sends when the connection is optimal (ideally wifi).<p>Finally, our backend application controls the unique ids for each room and item. Thus, each time we send these costs to the server, the server echoes the central database ids back, thus, that they can be synchronized in the mobile app. I have simplified this a little, since the operations contract is actually much larger, but I just want to illustrate the basic requirements without complicating matters.<p>Firstly, the web service architecture: We currently have a GetCosts and UpdateCosts operations.<p>My assumption is that if we used a strict REST architecture we would need to break our single web service operations into multiple smaller services. This would make the services much more chatty and we would also have to guarantee a delivery order from the app. For example, we need to make sure that containing rooms are added before the item.<p>Although this seems much more RESTful, our perception is that these extra calls are expensive connections (security checks, database calls, etc). Does the type of web api (operation over service focus) determine chunky vs chatty? Since this is mobile (3G), are we better handling lots of smaller messages, or a few large ones?<p>Secondly, the iOS side. We are primarily looking to the HN community's vast experience in developing native mobile apps (iOS 5 is our focus), with advice on how to manage data synchronization within the iOS app itself. We need multiple queues and we need to guarantee delivery order in each queue (and technically, ordering between queues). The server needs to control unique ids and other properties and echo them back to the application. The application then needs to update an internal database and when re-updating, make sure the correct ids are available in the update message (essentially multiple inserts and updates in one call).<p>Our backend has a ton of business logic operating on these cost estimates. We don't want any of this in the app itself.<p>I welcome any advice you might have.",1339670794
4110697,comment,4104262,4104407,1,0,waterhouse,,,"Regarding that quote about Rhodes Scholars--since no one has mentioned it yet, I will mention the phrase: ""regression to the mean"".  If, from a diverse population, you select a subpopulation with high scores on trait X measured by some noisy test, and you then re-test them sometime later (so that the noise is generated by fresh randomness the second time), you will likely find that they score worse.  This is because it is likely that the subpopulation you selected mostly benefited from the noise, and being lucky the first time is unrelated to being lucky the second time.  (That's one way to characterize luck.)<p>The regression-to-the-mean effect is obviously proportional to the ratio of ""noise"" to ""intrinsic qualities"".  If the amount of noise is close to zero, then the regression will be small; if the noise is gigantic or the intrinsic quality is zero, then the regression will be almost complete.  To illustrate the second case, you might imagine a population rolling six-sided dice, and a silly researcher selecting all those who rolled sixes and being astonished that their average had dropped to 3.5 on the second roll.  If you then imagine that each person had a private number from 0 to 50 that they added to their die rolls, then the test suddenly becomes much more meaningful.<p>With that in mind, we can hope to be more than simple-mindedly impressed or simple-mindedly cynical about Rhodes Scholars, child prodigies, Thiel Fellowship recipients, and so on.  How much ""noise"" is there, and what can be done about it?<p>For example, suppose that they're looking for people who do amazing things.  Suppose that most people who do amazing things do them because they're interested in them, and that there's a bunch of pseudo-randomness in what you happen to be interested in.  Then... they'll pick a bunch of people who just happened to be interested in doing things that the scholarship people found amazing.  What will these people be interested in doing next? there's a good chance it'll be completely not-amazing.  (Yes, some people have a deep, established interest in some field that is unlikely to change--but even within a field or subfield, you will find interesting things that are amazing and interesting things that are not.)  In that case, either they will look disappointing, or they will decide (probably due to feeling pressure) to try to work on amazing things even if they're not interesting.  I doubt if it's impossible to pull off the second option, but it is (by stipulation) a significant mode change for these people, and some received wisdom[1][2] says it's not likely to go well.<p>I hope that, instead, they are looking for people who have intense interests and great natural ability, and will try to shelter them from external pressure to produce ""amazing"" things, and that this press release is just crap they put out to please the media.  Meanwhile, I guess there might also be successful people who thrive on that kind of pressure... I just identify most strongly with the first group.  Also, it probably is a good thing to celebrate people's achievements.  It just carries some danger with it...<p>Anyway, I've described one type of amazing youth for which their apparent amazingness depends significantly on a capricious factor (what they're interested in).  I'm confident about my qualitative description, because I know myself and some other people that I think are of this type.  How significant is the interest factor? how capricious is it? can interest be deliberately controlled to some extent?  Are there other types of amazing youth? is their current amazingness also subject to significant amounts of randomness?  This, at least, would enable us to judge how much disappointingness we'd expect simply from the regression-to-the-mean principle.<p>Do people do serious scientific investigation about this sort of thing?  Seems like the Thiel Foundation had better, given that they're working in this exact field.  But charity-style things probably don't have systematic incentives to perform well... maybe we can hope that Peter Thiel will apply the kind of ruthless determination to succeed that I feel he has [maybe they're in fact selecting youths who exhibit this trait, which certainly seems it'd be more deterministic than ""interest""], and figure this stuff out.  Maybe.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kilcup/262/feynman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kilcup/262/feynman.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html</a> [see: ""When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems.

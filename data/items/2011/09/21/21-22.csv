So I get to hunt through the book page by page until I find that word.<p>The same thing applies to web pages of all kinds.

It sounds like support/sysadmin.<p>A pay pal transaction not completing due to a network outage is an ops issue not a dev issue.<p>Also, what's the pay? When you talk to actual developers the biggest issue is the problems finding out what the job actually pays. I hate talking to recruiters that won't tell me what it pays.

You use a message queue (SQS?) to store the work and you use the gerbils to 'consume' it. You store the state of the books in something called a ""database"" and you store the ""master book"" encrypted publicly on a CDN. The server puts a message in the queue telling the gerbil how to customize the book along with the URL for the master and the key to decrypt it. For pragmatic programmers they sure go out of there way to obscure that it's a simple producer / consumer model using SVN and a bunch of caches as a message queue / database monstrosity.<p>As for the coderay thing I'd rather just use the F# syntax parser from F# and decorate the AST as F# is my favorite language and it would take a couple hours to do it that way.

3023792,comment,3023132,3023642,18,0,aamar,,,"Let's say Google entered a clearly different market, such as making & delivering pizza. Further say: Google's pizza is slightly more expensive and somewhat less good than pizza created by their competitors. Based on that, we would ordinarily guess that their market share will be low to nonexistent.<p>But let's say Google reserves the most prominent position on their SERP for hundreds of relevant queries for one-click pizza delivery. Maybe the majority of people will still click through to Goat Hill Pizza or whatever, with tastier, cheaper pizza. But Google's more prominent position gives them an advantage vs. their competitor, and that will lead to increased and probably significant market share.<p>Now this is the key: we users could decide that Google's promotion of bad pizza on their SERP means we should switch to Bing. But Google's search engine is, despite this one bad case, still far superior to Bing's. So according to standard micro-economic analysis, pretty much all of us stick with Google, so Google Pizza continues to get the boost.<p>In summary, in this hypothetical, Google is using the ""excess"" excellence of their search engine to increase market share of very different products. Since those products may be unusually profitable, they also have an increased ability to drive competitors out of the market. If unchecked, wealthy firms with one great product can use this technique to extend their monopoly into more and more fields. The end result is that more consumers end up with worse quality products and (over time) fewer options due to less competition.<p>(Note: I'm not arguing that this is truly happening in real life. I'm trying to explain how even a free product with monopolistic dominance can be used to take over other markets with inferior products.)",1316640966

When I saw ""Accounting for Computer Scientists"" on HN (<a href=""http://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/07/accounting-for-computer-scientists.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/07/accounting-for-comput...</a>) it was a revelation to me, because I didn't realize that accounting could be so cleanly modeled as a graph structure.<p>Ever since then I've been itching to create some git-like software for accounting, where you have a repository of accounts and transactions.  I feel like there is so much unexplored territory here in terms of analysis and visualization.  For example, I want a way of saying ""this insurance bill is for six months of coverage"" and then seeing my bi-weekly breakdown of expenses include two weeks worth of that insurance bill.  I want to be able to tag expenses as non-discretionary (taxes), periodic (mortgage), or discretionary (latte) as an easy way of understanding my overall cash flow.  I want to be able to amortize my vacations over the whole year.  etc.<p>I want to be able to view what my hypothetical cash flow would be if I cut out certain periodic expenses or added others.<p>A lot of this is probably more complicated than what most people would want to do -- that's why I think the important part is having a standard repository model that's easily programmable.",1316640927

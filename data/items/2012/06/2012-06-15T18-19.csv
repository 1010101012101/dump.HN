Suppose a recruiting agency guaranteed their recruits, as in, ""We'll pay their salary for the [six months | year | whatever]. If they are acceptable, at the end of that period, you pay us back double. If they don't work out, let us know ASAP and we'll eat the cost.""<p>The incentives are all right here. The employers essentially get a year long job interview. Qualified candidates are basically guaranteed a job. And the recruiters are rewarded for successfully meeting their clients' needs, and punished if they get it wrong. The current situation rewards harassment and puffing up their candidates' resumes.",1339786773

My job has become really tedious lately working on things in which I have no personal interest. I work at a company that sometimes requires traveling to work at trade shows which is fun but also incredibly stressful, especially if we are behind and forced to work 95+ hours in a week before the show to get it done.<p>I've always loved programming and find it immensely fun and rewarding, but my current job has almost made me lose interest in programming itself. I've been considering leaving for a startup type deal (I'm fairly close to NY so the opportunity is there) but I haven't found anything cool yet. I love the idea of getting behind something I truly believe in, but I'm not sure a startup would be any less stressful than my current position. On the other hand, I consider myself fairly competent, but am only using a small fraction of my potential here.<p>Is there any real balance to it all that I should know about and do you have any tips on dealing with a lack of interest?<p>/throwaway to protect employment",1339786760

Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, ``The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.'' I don't know.

Check it out at www.dialasmile.me<p>I came up with the idea while trying to create a romantic gift for my girlfriend. Her last boyfriend had made a webpage with all the reasons he loved her on it, and so of course I wanted to one up him! So I decided I'd set up a phone number that she could call whenever I'm not around and she's lonely, that would speak all the reasons I love her out loud. I ended up making one for my mom too for Mother's Day, and she loved it, so I thought, ""Hey maybe I'll turn this into a web app so everyone can do it!""<p>One month later and its out! It's called DialASmile, and it allows you to create cute ""dialers"" for friends, family, and significant others. When they call the DialASmile phone number, they can hear all the reasons you love them, think they're awesome, etc, spoken out loud to them. Makes a cool little anniversary, holiday (or maybe even father's day!) gift. It's free to use to start, and if you use the promo code 'makedadsmile' between now and father's day you can get upgraded to an even better dialer for free.<p>Please check it out.

My point is that other factors than creating the crappy product is what gets you bought by Microsoft. There is no causal relationship between the quality of the product and the money received.

That would have the twin benefits of improving productivity in its own right and of implicitly teaching by example so less experienced developers in the organisation would tend to develop the same skills themselves over time.<p>If you had a seed of programmers on that level and a culture that promoted mentoring, pair programming, code reviews or similar collaborative exercises, its not hard to imagine that such an organisation would develop significantly higher collective performance over time than another organisation without those benefits, even if most people joining each organisation were of a similar level of skill and experience to start with.",1339784432

They made me wait 4 hours for an appointment so they could tell me it's now off warranty and offer to repair it for, I kid you not, more than I paid to buy the air new!<p>The end result is that my nice 2011 machine aluminum unibody air had a total life-time of less than a year.

From what I've experienced first hand, there's programmers that can produce similar code/software in a week that takes 5 mediocre programmers to produce in a month.

Great programmers in that regime produce software that is smaller, cleaner, tighter and higher quality.  But it's still just a bug database or social thing or web store, etc...  Anyone (even mediocre programmers) can look at it and say ""I know how that works.""<p>There's plenty of rock star coding out there, of course.  But it tends to be either hidden inside companies due to secrecy concerns (Google's scaling architecture or the NVIDIA driver stack, say) or exposed in the open source community instead of the startup world (Fabrice Bellard is a great example here).<p>Startups all say they want rock stars, but then they put them to work doing ""better versions"" of the same boring stuff we all recognize.

(And yet the people on offence always have the upper hand, but that is a different story.) Second, most of the hiring for offensive talent is at the Speculation phase. NSA doesn't really outsource much of its work on this kind of stuff. The contractors know that the demand will eventually ramp up but it hasn't yet.

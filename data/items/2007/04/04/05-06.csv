8724,comment,8722,8722,0,0,zaidf,,,"So we had a few marketing ideas for our start-up which I sent to one of my PR contacts who had given a speech at our uni ad club.<p>He replied stating he and his firm loved what we were doing and offered some valuable insights. Additionally, he said he'd be interested in working with us to execute our planned campaign and in general get more attention for us. <p>From the contents of his reply, if things work out we can get them to do PR for us for equity in our start-up...which opens a Pandora's Box of questions such as how much equity, how exactly the terms would be worded etc. <p>Would love to hear from folks who've been involved in similar kind of deals in past. We're scheduled for a call later today.<p>I am specifically looking for the smaller non-obvious details I should keep in mind as I discuss things with my PR contact later today.",1175664690

Justin immediately presents us with live video and even provides his real cell phone number. I was actually the first user to call, as far as I know :). On Ustream, I'm having trouble viewing any live video and even more trouble understanding what exactly I'm watching. \n",1175664597

Any iTunes-iPod lock-in that Apple has is through the seamless experience of syncing one's music onto his or her iPod through iTunes.<p>The move towards non-DRM music will help Apple avoid anti-trust issues in Scandinavia and make buying digital music a better experience for users. User affinity is the #1 lock-in strategy and no one knows this better than Apple. \n",1175664265

8717,comment,8510,8682,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""College is not so much about learning a set of data, but learning how to learn.""<p>I've heard that a lot.  My high school was basically founded around that premise, and I completely bought into it then.  IMNSHO <i>now</i>, it's complete bullshit.<p>You don't learn how to learn by having someone teach you.  You learn how to learn by butting your head up against a problem, reading everything you can about what other people have already done on the problem, trying different approaches until one works, and moving on to the next problem.  After you've repeated this a few hundred times, you start figuring out which approaches are likely to work and which aren't.<p>The Ph.D is a good example.  There are plenty of people that are ""ABD"" (All But Dissertation) - they've gone through all the coursework, been taught all that their instructors can teach them, but nobody considers them ""real"" Ph.Ds.  Why?  Because the meat of a Ph.D program is actually going out and <i>doing original research</i>, and someone who hasn't done the research doesn't really know how to do the research.<p>The point of a certification program is to decouple the act of learning from the act of judging how much has been learned.  Right now, universities perform both functions, which in any other industry would be a ludicrous conflict of interest.  And so we get grade inflation and colleges refusing to admit poorer students because it'll drop their U.S. News rankings.",1175663052

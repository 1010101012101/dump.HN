The biggest thing to manage in a redesign is risk. Risk you alienate your user base or do something that negatively impacts revenue, or whatever you're most afraid of.<p>The easiest way to manage it is to shorten your feedback cycle (not user feedback, any type of feedback) to the smallest possible interval. When talking about design, this means you need to spend the least amount of time on the design you can before you put it in front of someone that exemplifies your average user (persona).",1246650058

Maybe some of this strict enforcement has shifted off into test suites.<p>The author's observation that anticipating changes / future requirements in software is often misguided and ill-informed fits right into this trend toward simplicity.

The brain and human intelligence itself doesn't exist outside of evolution.  If it turns out that humans being smart enough to modify their own genes doesn't work out, doesn't produce viable offspring, and ultimately loses out to undirected selection, would we say that that's a failing of our capabilities or that evolution didn't select for human control of their own gene selection?  Does the answer to this question change over different time scales or if our evolution was to be studied by other intelligent species?<p>It ceases to be undirected natural selection, but continues to be evolution.<p>""Intelligent design"" assumes an intelligence outside and other than humans.  This is part of the ""playing God"" argument against research in this area.  So while I agree that the term ""intelligent design"" may be more appropriate, that doesn't preclude it from still being ""evolution"" over the long term (which is largely what evolution is focused on).  I'd also rather not have the terms get mixed up; calling this ""intelligent design"" serves to confuse the ongoing religion vs science argument/debate that is holding back innovation and laws in this area.",1246648616

We did it initially because competitors were posting bad reviews and we had to counter them.<p>I think the solution to it will be if the appstore review becomes a threaded discussion board in which developer can post comments to any reviews and everything is attached with an email. So, if a user posts a review and a developer replies to that review, there should be an email sent back to the reviewer stating the developers comment. And there should definitely be a system in place where any review posting on any store front for all the apps by the developer of that app should be alerted by an email.

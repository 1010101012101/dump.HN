You could have an AI that directly answers your questions based on the knowledge it's gained from processing the entire net, with references supplied.<p>More easily implementable, you could have something that cross references a knowledge base such as Wikipedia (or just analyse the content of articles themselves) to split results into relevent categories, eg, Paris the city and Paris Hilton. Or, more tricky, one that I faced today - Flash Reflection, which could mean either a graphical effect or runtime type information.<p>What about reddit style voting? Google tried this, but I'm sure that ranking results by some measure of searcher satisfaction would be a great way to cut out duplicate/spammy content. Pagerank isn't.<p>I'm sorry, but calling it ""good enough"" is more of an indicator of lack of imagination than the merits of Google search.",1199437075

I don't really find anything wrong with an option to mine other sources for data, and I'm sure I could find some way to justify (to myself) locking out mining from a site of my own, but there's no way I'd do both.<p>I'm not even sure it makes business sense (most unethical practices don't in the long run). While a massive shift away from Facebook could happen (ala Friendster), Facebook would do far better trying to raise their value to users and solidify their status as a platform to prevent that from happening.",1199436267

Here in India you can ask any bank for your transaction history and they'll give it to you. You might have to go to the local branch and show id and wait while they print out the transaction history, but you'll get it for sure.",1199433720

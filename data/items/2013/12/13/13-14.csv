6900452,comment,6900004,6900131,7,0,evanspa,,,"I love Hal Abelson&#x27;s opening of this SICP lecture[1], in which he acknowledges that OO (with mutable state) is born from the idea of modeling computer programs the way we perceive the world.  But then he goes on to say that the reason why OO can be so complicated (because of having to deal with the can-of-worms that is mutable state) is because maybe we have the wrong view of reality.<p>He then proceeds to launch his piece of chalk across the room!  (good stuff).  And proposes that instead of the chalk having changing state (position, velocity, etc), instead, its better to thing of the chalk as a collection of immutable values; each value existing at a moment in time.  And this of course aligns more to functional programming; and you see the same notion (immutable values over time) with descriptions of Datomic.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/6a-streams-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-comput...</a>",1386942881

In concurrent programming safe operations are not composable, i.e. if you have >1 thread-safe operations then using those operations in parallel won&#x27;t be thread-safe by itself).<p>That&#x27;s true. I also agree that regardless of the language or libraries used one needs to be aware of concurrency issues and understand them. The world is concurrent and there is no way around that.<p>What I took issue with was the statement that you will have locks and even if they are in your libraries, they will come back to bite you. That is simply not true in case of complete languages/environments designed for concurrency. Clojure is one I know — and it isn&#x27;t just a &quot;library&quot; that helps, it&#x27;s the combination of language design, functional approach, data structures, immutable data and software transactional memory.<p>Incidentally, the words &quot;thread-safe&quot; are really hard to encounter if you write in Clojure.

6900398,comment,6899941,6899941,5,0,jorleif,,,"&quot;only a tiny component of thinking is about prediction at all&quot;<p>Here I really struggle to follow his argument. It seems, he is saying that thinking is not prediction, but how does he know that? As I see it, we don&#x27;t know what thinking is, so is he then saying that thinking does not feel like prediction, and therefore it cannot be prediction? It is well known that we are only aware of our very highest level of thought. What goes on below the surface may very well be very much about prediction without us knowing about. When we think about &quot;the world&quot; we must have some internal representation of the configuration of objects that we think about. In my opinion this is implicitly a kind of prediction, because we create (at least mostly) configurations that are plausible, if not true (counterfactual, but possible).<p>It seems to me that creativity is mostly about finding good approximate solutions to hard (e.g. NP-complete) problems. How we do it is so far unknown, but it seems that it is not in principle so very special. The explanation for the calendar he speaks about is actually not very complicated inference at all, and is probably in reach for artificial systems. All he has to do is to generalize 19 as belonging to a number category, and then apply the predictive properties about how numbers work. Not all prediction is naively predicting that the world is as it was before. If change is predictable in the past, then change can also be predicted to the future. Prediction is difficult, but that does not make it less important.",1386942091

6900389,comment,6893971,6898218,2,0,oleganza,,,"&quot;if the bulk of the pricing set for bitcoin is by transactions founded in speculation&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the logical flaw. I don&#x27;t blame you, modern economics are witchcraft and many people are being lied to all the time.<p>Price of Bitcoin, or Dollar, or Euro does not and never will depend on some transactions out there. Easy proof: I can shuffle coins with 5 of my friends with an incredible speed and it won&#x27;t matter for you or anyone else. Why? Because transactions are <i>effect</i>, not <i>cause</i> of the value.<p>Why transaction happens in the first place? Why do you give $2K for a macbook and owner of a macbook gives you a macbook in return? Money by itself is pretty worthless. &quot;You must pay taxes with it&quot; is not a reason. You are taxed with money only because it already has value established via other means.<p>So here we go: money gives you freedom to buy stuff any time you want. Just by sitting in your account for a day, or a year, or 10 years, it always provides you with ability to buy things any moment. And it&#x27;s equally true for everyone else in the economy: you have this freedom to buy stuff only because other people believe in the same freedom to buy stuff. That&#x27;s why they accept money from you in exchange for their product. Everyone wants to have some cash to use it when they like. That&#x27;s the only value and function of cash. The more hands want to believe in this money and hold it, the bigger liquidity of it. If the supply is fixed, it means the price must grow as number of holders grows.<p>Whether you actually make these transactions is irrelevant. Of course, if no one is making transactions, then there&#x27;s probably little value in money, but that&#x27;s not because of transactions. If no one is making transactions it&#x27;s either money is hugely valuable like a long-term &quot;store of wealth&quot; (e.g. gold), or because it&#x27;s shitty money that no one wants (e.g. soviet ruble in 2013). And on contrary, if everyone is making transactions, it&#x27;s either because money is useful and liquid (e.g. dollar bills or bitcoin), or it&#x27;s depreciating very quickly (e.g. argentinian peso). In all of these cases transactions are effect of value, not the cause.<p>Strictly speaking, every holder of money is a speculator. Whether he sold his product, other money, or his kidney is irrelevant. If he is willing to hold this money versus some other money or other forms of property, that&#x27;s his speculation. That means this money is more useful for him than else at this moment.<p>Maybe this quote from Murray Rothbard will be helpful (his books are really-really eye-opening, highly recommend):\n<a href=\"http://blog.oleganza.com/post/43378777734/on-circulation-of-money\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.oleganza.com/post/43378777734/on-circulation-of-...</a>",1386942016

Boom. done.<p>Well, as it turns out, my dev environment is Mac, and my production is running on the cloud, in an Ubuntu environment.

I know, it kind of goes with having a single binary.<p>It probably would have taken me 2 hours max to figure things out, but going back to hardware consideration really felt a bit weird and kind of tamed my enthusiasm of the moment.

When figuring out how I could overcome it, I remember reading accounts of KDE developers trying to embed vim into their widgets and failing over and over. In the end, there was a solution to &quot;embed&quot; vim with some special IPC the netbeans IDE developers put into vim, but you had to run vim as a separate process for that to work - which is not possible on the web as it stands today.

Her books give a perspective on what life was like as a member of a class (females) in a society which terribly oppressive for them. What would it be like to be a very intelligent, well-read person who is not allowed to hold a job at a professional or managerial level, not allowed to get a college education, not allowed (generally speaking) to travel freely or own property without restrictions. In many respects, this world is as alien to us as anything found in scifi or fantasy and is therefore a fascinating and horrifying view.<p>Austen will give you this perspective. If you pay attention closely, you can also learn quite a bit about the ground level view of the English class system in the regency period and how it worked for people on varying social strata. Her novel, Emma, is particularly good at this.<p>Even the focus on courtship and marriage, which many people will find completely frivolous, has an interesting message. I can&#x27;t find the exact quote so this is from memory, Austen once remarked that her focus on marriage was because the marriage proposal was the one free choice (in terms of refusal) women were allowed to have. And considering the social and legal power the husband would have over the wife, the woman&#x27;s choice becomes the thing which will determine the course of her life. From this point of view, there&#x27;s no wonder why marriage is presented as such an overwhelmingly important event.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll give her books another chance.",1386940420

1394919,comment,1394635,1394635,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"Fail.<p>Ever seen those psychological tests that have word ""RED"" printed in blue ink, the word ""BLUE"" in yellow ink, and so forth?  The test is to say the <i>color</i>, not the word.  Most people find it difficult and irritating, because the verbal parts of their brains hijack the process and insist on reading the words.<p>The point of using meaningless text is to quiet the verbal parts of your brain, so you can become conscious of the abstract visual and aesthetic elements.<p>The converse is also true.  Design of the verbal elements has to use meaningful text, preferably in a context where the visual and aesthetic design has been toned down to not distract. Hence the popularity of monochrome wire-frame mockups for document design.<p>Edited.",1275396804

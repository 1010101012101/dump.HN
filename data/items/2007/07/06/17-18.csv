32806,comment,32601,32601,0,0,naivehs,,,"Problem: People are lazy, Yahoo had way too many links on their homepage. While variety is nice, the first impression casual users get from Yahoo is ""ok... where do I start?"" For that reasons, so much of Yahoo's contents never get a chance to be viewed. To emphasize, Yahoo has great articles and analysis that are fun and interesting to read, Google doesn't.<p>Solution: Yahoo should change their homepage into something like Google, but add a second search bar with the label ""What do you Yahoo to do today?"" As someone types into the textbox, related Yahoo contents appear diretly (like the Vista search).<p>Bottomline: With a simple twist on the homepage, Yahoo does not really have to change much to become more popular than Google.

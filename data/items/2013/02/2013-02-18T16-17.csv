The server-side time is only a portion of that, but it's clearly delineated.<p>I think this whole thing is composed of two issues: Rap Genius realized that requests were queueing at the dyno level (bad) and decided that they needed numbers to back that up. Unfortunately they picked a number (queue time) that doesn't have much functional basis on Heroku's stack at the moment, which weakens their argument.<p>What I would like to see change, is to see an additional header placed on the front end of the dyno machine by Nginx or Apache or Yaws or whatever web server runs local to the dyno, immediately as the request hits the machine. That would enable the current New Relic Agent to pick up the queue time spent on the local machine correctly, and basically entirely eliminate the problem of inaccurate queue time statistics.<p>There's actually code in there already to handle this already - add an HTTP_X_REQUEST_START header to your requests as they enter the machine and it'll be recorded. Not sure how it's displayed these days, I haven't been privy for a couple years now, but the code still exists and records statistics in the Agent.",1361206553

The generics issue you mentioned, along with the lack of lambdas in Java (which is why I think languages like Clojure and Scala have gotten popular) are the two biggest reasons Java is a serious no-go for me. Java is a strictly typed language that makes dealing with types hard. C# is a strictly typed language that makes dealing with types easy.<p>The problem is that there is no community behind it. The vast majority of C# programmers are do-the-bare-minimum-contractors who hang up their keyboard at the end of the day and go home to their Top Chef and NFL on TV. Those people don't contribute to anything in any community, let alone the open source community.<p>There are a lot of ways to be able to do C# for free, both as in libre and as in gratis. Mono has about as big of an OSS community behind it as you will find in C#, and it even has support from Microsoft. The language itself is an EMCA standard, and much of the CLR VM and runtime library are, too. The parts that aren't OSS in the library have very reasonable alternatives, in fact, even if OSS wasn't a concern for you, those alternatives are so good you should probably be using them anyway.<p>And it's in almost every package repository out there, certainly all of the ones I've tried. I personally think setup is a sight easier than Java. I've personally found it a little easier to get setup with Mono that with Java; there is some fragmentation in Java that, while not insurmountable, is still a small annoyance.<p>Yes, you're not going to get a great IDE for it yet. MonoDevelop is buggy in weird ways. You could cheat and run VS Express in WINE, but I have a feeling some people are going to have a problem with that for no good reason other than to have a reason to complain.<p>I'd say, if you're the type of developer that is capable of putting together her entire toolchain from the ground up, C# is one of the best languages out there and it's a shame more people don't consider it. If you need hand-holding, then yes, it's really hard to do C# well on anything other than Windows. It's getting better, and will continue to grow, so don't discount it completely.",1361206442

5239001,comment,5238481,5238481,3,0,vyrotek,,,"There's actually a fast growing trend to use Facebook groups to sell things. They call them ""24/7 Yardsales"". They'll make a group for each city and then people bid through the comments. Some of the groups have over 8000 members. The experience is a bit different though compared to normal classifieds. The reason they refer to them as yardsales is because the members of the groups usually aren't looking for something specific. They're all just 'window shopping' for deals and Facebook notifies them instantly when something new is available.<p>My wife was pretty active in these groups and eventually came to me saying that a lot of people wished there was a better way to do this. So, I did what any good husband would do and spent a few weeks putting a site together for them. I combined her two favorite things. Pinterest & Yardsales. <a href=""http://yardable.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yardable.com</a> (It was a nice excuse to play with some new tech too :P) All the items and users on the site are legit. I found some humor in the fact that the first items officially sold on Yardable were my old CS college books. I felt as if I had passed on the torch.<p>I wish I had more time to work on this. I got as far as building an API for a few people who wanted to build the mobile app for me. It seems like there's some interest in something better than Craigslist with more 'browsing' type features. There are a few startups out there working on this I believe. One of them is a YC company called <a href=""http://www.getyardsale.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getyardsale.com</a> which went with the mobile approach first. Monetizing these ideas through something besides ads seems a bit challenging though.",1361204858

5238982,comment,5236505,5237934,2,0,droithomme,,,"Tesla offers, for a $12,000 fee at time of purchase, a replacement policy that will replace the battery AFTER 8 years of use, and only after 8 years of use. This brings the price of the 240 mile range model to $91,900, plus tax and licensing. It is not a warranty that replaces the battery if it fails. It offers no coverage before 8 years, and at 8 years one may replace at any time.<p>Tesla also has cited a price of $40,000 for battery replacement for drivers whose batteries have failed due to not being recharged properly or other reasons. This price is consistent with the lowest wholesale costs of these battery cells on the global market, with no markup for their added value of the battery enclosure, cooling, heating, monitoring, and recharging hardware, thus it is a fair deal and good value as Tesla is clearly not taking any profit at this battery price point.<p>Tesla does not sell the 85kWh batteries (the ones needed to have a 170-240 mile range) for $12,000. If you hand them $12,000, they will not hand you a battery pack. If Tesla could sell these batteries at this price, they could sell a tremendous number to Nissan, GM, Boeing and others. They could even charge $20,000 and would still have plenty of buyers as it is far below the lowest wholesale cost of the 6800 3100mA 3.7V Panasonic 18650 Li-ion battery cells it contains. Or even better, customers could buy the 6800 new 18650 cells in the pack from Tesla for the $12,000, remove them from the battery pack, and become a wholesale dealer of the cells, able to undercut Panasonic's lowest wholesale price by up to 75%. One could make millions selling new battery cells to laptop battery pack manufacturers that use these cells. It is a sure fire guaranteed profit if, as you say, Tesla is selling battery packs containing 6800 brand new 3100mA 3.7V Panasonic 18650 Li-ion battery cells for only $12,000. It is the bargain of a lifetime. No VC would pass on funding such a venture, it is a guaranteed profit.<p>The claim that Tesla is selling these battery packs for $12,000 is false. Tesla is not selling these batteries for that price. They will sell these batteries for $40,000 though, as Tesla's Vice President J. Joost de Vries has stated that that is the price for those who need a replacement.<p>Tesla does offer to deliver a replacement battery in no less than eight years from purchase date for $12000 (February 2021 if you buy today), to the original owner, provided this fee was paid for when the car is purchased, and provided Tesla is still in business. This is not the same as selling batteries for $12000.",1361204653

If the FDA is doing such a poor job of protecting our food, why isn't private industry stepping up to the plate?</i><p>What's stopping them is the fact that there is a much stronger body that already has an anointed legitimacy. The ""market opportunity"" for doing this is gone if the government is already doing it, and on top of that is the final say on the matter (they after all do get to take things off the market).<p><i>> These problems happen because the FDA is too much in bed with the private industries they're supposed to be regulating. What needs to be done is to make them more independent from those private industries, and strengthen the FDA</i><p>Should we do this before or after we make bank regulators more independent from the banks? Or before or after we make the military committees in congress more independent from the military contractors? Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Go into more or less any government agency that interacts with industry and you'll find them in bed. Its easy to say things ""should"" be more independent, but its hard to actually accomplish it. One reason, again, is because its hard to hold anyone liable for anything in government (who polices the police?). After all, its already the case that in theory the FDA, composed of ""non-political"" scientists is already supposed to be 100% independent. <i>How</i> exactly do you propose making them more independent? Mind you, giving them more power does not make them independent, it just makes their decisions harder to fight against (which can work against you if for example they rule against a small company since it is in the interests of a big company). Again, the ""libertarian"" point here is that there is no real incentive for them to do a good job. We have to rely on them wanting to be ""good people"" and make the right decision. Because if they make a bad decision, there are no negative consequences since there is no competition: they certainly wouldn't lose their right to decide things, whereas making a wrong decision in a private market could be devastating as no one would trust them anymore.<p><i>> not to get rid of the FDA and replace them with some pipe dream that only works in some libertarian utopia.</i><p>Please stop referring to these proposals as ""pipe dreams"" of ""utopias"", it is a really shallow straw man. No is arguing that things would be perfect, it is simply an alternative idea that some people believe would be better, but no rational person thinks would be completely without issue (just like you think the current system is better, but <i>clearly</i> has issues as well -- there is no perfect answer). The most important thing to realize is that by discussing these opposing viewpoints in a respectful manner, you might actually gain ideas about how to improve your own system (for example it might give you inspiration for a way to truly make the FDA independent, which I agree would be great).",1361204337

In an inertial frame under those conditions the particles with higher velocities would be moving closer to the other particles, not getting further away from them. There is a contradiction.</i><p>This is actually a better statement of the argument than the one given on the web page (better because it's more concise and doesn't get bogged down in irrelevancies); in fact it makes it clearer to me just what the argument is actually supposed to be. However, it's still not a valid argument against GR. Here's why: GR <i>agrees</i> that, with respect to Frame X, the particle above the horizon and the particle below the horizon get closer together! But only within the confines of Frame X, and only with respect to distance relative to Frame X.<p>Distance is frame-dependent; distance relative to Frame X is <i>not</i> the same thing as distance with respect to the radial coordinate r that is used in a global coordinate chart. The fact that the particles are getting closer with respect to distance relative to Frame X does <i>not</i> mean that they are getting closer together with respect to the coordinate r; in fact they are not. The particle inside the horizon has an r coordinate that decreases with time, while the one outside the horizon has an r coordinate that increases with time (here ""time"" is time with respect to Frame X).<p>Also, the fact that the particles are getting closer together with respect to Frame X does not mean that they will be getting closer together with respect to some other local inertial frame centered on an event further along the horizon. Local inertial frames centered on different events don't ""line up"" in curved spacetime the way they do in flat spacetime; that's one way of expressing what it means for a spacetime to be curved. So you can't assume that, just because the particles are getting closer together with respect to Frame X, they will continue to get closer together once they've left Frame X, much less that they will continue to get closer together until they meet. That deduction would be valid in flat spacetime, but it isn't in curved spacetime.<p><i>When you say that singularities have a location in time only you can't then refer to their location in space without contradicting yourself. The ""in the center of the black hole there"" references a place in space. You'd have to instead be careful to say something like ""you won't be pointing to the singularity that you say is in the center of the black hole there"".</i><p>Fine, consider my statement suitably modified (it should have been obvious from context that that's what I meant anyway, but if you insist on quibbling over language, so be it). As modified, the statement is true.<p>Instead of quibbling over language, you could have asked a relevant question: what <i>are</i> you pointing at when you point at the center of the galaxy? The problem with this question is that it assumes that there is a unique answer to it; that there is some unique ""object"" sitting ""at the center of the galaxy"". In an ordinary spacetime without a black hole present, that would be a valid assumption; but it isn't when there is a black hole present. In one sense, when you point at the center of the galaxy, you could be said to be pointing at the object or objects that originally collapsed to form the black hole there; in another sense, you could be said to be pointing at the hole's horizon. Once again, a spacetime with a black hole in it doesn't work like the ordinary flat spacetime you are used to, or even like an ordinary curved spacetime with a planet or star in the center instead of a black hole (so that there is no event horizon and no singularity).<p><i>I first saw this blog yesterday.</i><p>But haven't scenarios at least something like this come up in your classes?",1361203878

I'm not saying it's always right, but in the long-term this has saved me a lot of headaches.<p>Sorry for raining on everyone's parade, though. This really isn't the proper way to start a conversation.",1361203567

5238883,comment,5238098,5238098,1,0,bane,,,"Like many other folks here, I can tell good wine from bad too, in so much as I can tell wine I like from wine I don't like. Even better, I can usually find lots of wines I like that are under $12-10.<p>I even have regions I know have a higher probability of making wines I'll probably like.<p>But I've had some pleasant surprises. I don't typically like Virginia wines for example, but I was recently introduced to Virginia Chambourcin wines, most of which I've found great. Likewise I don't typically like most White wines, but the Viogniers from Virginia have typically been to my taste.<p>More importantly, over the last few years I've gotten to appreciate wines that I may not like on their own, but pair well with certain foods and round out the flavor profile, vs. wines I can just sit with and drink.<p>The truth is the difference between good and bad wine is not some pretentious expert's objective ranking, but whether you like it or not.<p>For the record, my three favorite wines at the moment are:<p>Penfolds Koonunga Hill Shiraz Cabernet - Australia - $10<p>Cantina Zaccagnini Montepulciano dAbruzzo - Italy - $12<p>Santa Rita Cabernet Reserva - Chile - $10<p>All go well with various foods or just by themselves. And yes I steer towards full-bodied reds.<p>But context can be just as important, I've also enjoyed cheap house wine while eating just as cheap food at local family eateries in Italy. I probably wouldn't buy that wine, but in that milieu it just ""worked"".<p>One rule of thumb I like to use when selecting from wines I don't know is that generally, a deeper punt (the indentation on the bottom of the bottle) on the bottle leads to wines I like better -- it's supposed to help with collecting sediment before pouring. But of course there's always exceptions. Excelsior (South Africa) makes some stupid cheap ($6-7) but pretty good wines with a twist off top and a shallow punt.<p>There are more ""fashionable"" wines I just don't like. I've yet to meet a California Pinot Noir I liked for example (the central wine in the movie Sideways).<p>Just try lots of wines, get a feel for the flavors, start to catalog which ones you like and don't like and you'll eventually develop your own taste. There's no shortage of wines to try, and there's thousands of under $10 bottles you can experiment with.<p>Just go with that and have fun.",1361203523

The economics have little to do with iphone apps and desktop software. And complexity of software has no relation whatsoever to its utility.<p>Running a service is expensive.

More likely he is going to get 100 sales either way, because he might manage to get his product in front of 100 people for whom the problem solving value exceeds the cost, and who has a $10/yr problem?<p>Fact is this a product targeted at businesses. The type of people who are actually interested in paying money for someone to solve their problem do not care about the difference between $10 and $100. Do you save them $101 worth of time? Then sold! If anything I would be suspicious of a low price like $10/yr because I know it's not viable.",1361203501

5238859,comment,5238455,5238455,6,0,randomdrake,,,"Very interesting read. As someone who struggled through the implementation of Jenks[1] a few years ago in PHP, I can attest to the fact that it was extremely difficult to find any programming of Jenks that was understandable and clear. I was able to find some examples of code, but nothing could explain what was actually happening and, as you said, there were no comments or poor comments in those examples.<p>What I was able to find, were a couple of different explanations of the mathematics. Instead of trying to decode some crappy programming implementations, I spent my time teaching myself the math to understand what the representation of the process[2] actually meant. From there, I was able to understand the iterative process involved and dream up a working solution.<p>Instead of concluding programmers should be better or knowledge should be more free, I came to the conclusion that I just needed to understand the problem and the math behind it better.<p>Could it be that maybe the assertion regarding the problem of availability is actually just a problem of lack of understanding or desire for proper comprehension? I'm not accusing the author of laziness, merely wondering if a different conclusion and solution could be arrived at with an alternate point of view on the problem.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://github.com/randomdrake/jenks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/randomdrake/jenks</a> - feel free to check out my implementation.

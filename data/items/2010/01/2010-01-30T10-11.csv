Now you've got a reason to prefer cars over vans.<p>I (and in my experience most students feel the same) always liked learning better when it was about concrete problems and not just an abstract operation. If I'd had to learn programming without real-world applications, I wouldn't have bothered.<p>I explain this by pointing out that physics has theoreticians and experimentalists. Seems to me that's about mental style. Also, it's easier to communicate an idea when you've got a physical metaphor.",1264848824

1088503,comment,1087316,1087340,0,0,cstross,,,"Rubbish.<p>The US Navy's SSBNs work the same way. A second strike deterrent force <i>by definition</i> has to have decentralized launch authority. The backstop is that no single officer can launch the missiles, it takes joint action -- and the officers are carefully screened before being put in that position. One rogue sub officer? Maybe. Enough of them to overpower the rest of the crew and carry out an unauthorized launch? Very unlikely, and begs the question of <i>why</i>.",1264848363

1088493,comment,1087493,1087493,0,0,moe,,,"Fortunately he put the only correct response to this nonsense right in there - saves me some typing. Quote from the varnish team:<p>This is not a security problem in Varnish or any other piece of software
which writes a logfile.<p>The real problem is the mistaken belief that you can cat(1) a random
logfile to your terminal safely.<p>This is not a new issue. I first remember the issue with xterm(1)'s
inadvisably implemented escape-sequences in a root-context, brought up
heatedly, in 1988, possibly late 1987, at Copenhagens University
Computer Science dept. (Diku.dk). Since then, nothing much have changed.<p>The wisdom of terminal-response-escapes in general have been questioned
at regular intervals, but still none of the major terminal emulation
programs have seen fit to discard these sequences, probably in a
misguided attempt at compatibility with no longer used 1970'es
technology.<p>I admit that listing ""found a security hole in all HTTP-related programs
that write logfiles"" will look more impressive on a resume, but I think
it is misguided and a sign of trophy-hunting having overtaken common
sense.<p>Instead of blaming any and all programs which writes logfiles, it would
be much more productive, from a security point of view, to get the
terminal emulation programs to stop doing stupid things, and thus fix
this and other security problems once and for all.",1264847124

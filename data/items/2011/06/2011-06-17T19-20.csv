2666866,comment,2666476,2666476,10,0,IgorPartola,,,"The OP talks about how in the age where there are more readers than ever, writers are undervalued. What the OP fails to mention is the quality of readers and writers. A reader who consumes 100,000 pages worth of Facebook statuses is not really much of a reader. Historically, reading was used as a means to communicate ideas. Think Machiavelli, Aristotle, Nietzsche. Now it is used for communicating a much larger scope of information: ""Lady Gaga Pantless in Paris"". You cannot compare a writer that writes the Illiad and a writer that writes TV Show reviews of shows they've never seen. They are not the same category.",1308340791

He had four (human) volunteers walk through a prairie dog village, and he dressed all the humans exactly the same  except for their shirts. Each volunteer walked through the community four times: once in a blue shirt, once in a yellow, once in green and once in gray.<p>He found, to his delight, that the calls broke down into groups based on the color of the volunteer's shirt. ""I was astounded,"" says Slobodchikoff. But what astounded him even more, was that further analysis revealed that the calls also clustered based on other characteristics, like the height of the human. ""Essentially they were saying, 'Here comes the tall human in the blue,' versus, 'Here comes the short human in the yellow,' "" says Slobodchikoff.<p>Amazingly, it doesn't stop there. Slobodchikoff's next move was to see if prairie dogs could differentiate between abstract shapes. So he and his students built two wooden towers on each side of a prairie dog village. They then made cardboard cutouts of circles, squares and triangles and ran them out along a wire strung between the two towers, so the shapes sort of floated through the village about three feet from the ground. And the prairie dogs, Slobodchikoff found, were able to tell the difference between the triangle and the circle, but, alas, they made no mention of the difference between the square and the circle.<p>---------------------<p>I wonder how aliens analyze our intelligence:<p>- sent round blue flying saucer - a lot of buzz<p>- sent stick-looking device <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/International/ufo-china-closes-airport-prompts-investigation/story?id=11159531"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/International/ufo-china-closes-airport...</a> - a lot of the same buzz.<p>Conclusion: probably the humans can't distinguish the abstract shapes.",1308340304

The person who is preying on the weak is someone who invested time into learning about the skills that the customer does not know. Let's say this customer was a farmer. He is using the money he too got from preying on the weak non-farmers to purchase protection.<p>In the case of preying on the weak for fun we also have some things being hidden behind the words. For example, fun in this case means stealing identities, trying to ruin relationships, and sending dildos to innocents.<p>It's cool though for the author because by having things written in these terms its easy for people to talk past each other. They don't realize the context in which he has placed the words in the article. When other people see the terms its easy to think that maybe ""preying on the weak for profit"" is referring to blackhats instead of capitalism.<p>Another thing worth pointing out is that the person who is volunteering to give away the information for free is actually someone who also put in a lot of time to learn all the things that the customer didn't know. So when he says ""I could teach it to him quickly"" he is really saying ""I will provide the same service in exchange for you're weekend."" The thing is that when these two ""companies"" compete only the one charging money is going to stay afloat.

2666766,comment,2665070,2666576,3,0,mraleph,,,"1. V8 does not perform tail call elimination (AFAIK none of the major JS VMs perform it) because certain legacy JS language features (namely func.arguments and similar) are not TCE-friendly (see for more details <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=457"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=457</a>). So manually performing TCE indeed reduces number of (relatively) long lived objects: tails of the string created with substr.<p>2. I am not sure about this question. V8 uses cons-strings internally: so it is important to understand that c = a + b does not result (at least not immediately) in an allocation of a new sequential string and copying characters from a and b to it. That means that concatenating many strings does not cost much (especially if they are large) at the moment of concatenation. Actual concatenation happens later, when you start indexing into this string: V8 will flatten it (convert from cons-string form into sequential form).<p>3. See 2. If you intermix indexing and concatenation you basically force s to oscillate between cons and sequential forms: cons-string is created, then flattened on indexing, and result is concatenated with the string forming a cons-string which gets flattened... Resulting performance is bad because cons-strings actually become pure overhead (you waste more on their creation than you benefit from them) in this cycle of concatenation and flattening.<p>4. '*' as a prefix means optimized function and '~' as a prefix means non-optimized function.<p>5. Everything starting from 'Understanding Numbers' slide is a collection of facts unrelated to the first part of the talk about profiling. To get the idea of how typed arrays affect performance you can read my blog post: <a href=""http://blog.mrale.ph/post/5436474765/dangers-of-cross-language-benchmark-games"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mrale.ph/post/5436474765/dangers-of-cross-langua...</a><p>6. HiddenClass slides try to illustrate the idea of inline caching (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching</a>) without using assembly. It's pseudo-code. HiddenClass is a structure that describes layout of an object. Slides #42-#50 illustrate how VM builds hidden classes hierarchy while executing the code. Slides #51-#52 try to illustrate how you can utilize hidden classes when you compile code. There are couple presentations that discuss hidden classes at the lower and more detailed level: for example Mads Ager's talk at Google IO 2009: <a href=""http://youtu.be/FrufJFBSoQY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/FrufJFBSoQY</a><p>7. No, there were no example (it's impossible to fit that much into a single 40m talk). In V8 ICs have a special megamorphic state in addition to monomorphic state. Megamorphic stubs are not specialized for types IC had seen (unlike monomorphic stubs), instead they rely on a cache of monomorphic stubs (indexed by hidden class of the receiver).<p>8. Those are functions that force object from fast-mode to dictionary-mode.<p>9. In non optimized code it is materialized when used in the code. In optimized it is never materialized (but as the slide says: if you ""misuse"" arguments in a function it will not be optimized).<p>10. I have not seen any real world code that suffers from this problem. But people ask about scopes and closed-variables quite often that is why it is included.",1308339115

Which one do you find most pleasing? Most dramatic? Most like the real thing?<p>The one on the left is more pleasing to me. The one on the right looks garish. The one on the right is the stretched one right? In fact they both look distorted to me, I believe the images also are being scaled to irregular proportions by the HTML. A direct link to the source image of the one on the left looks correct to me:
<a href=""http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/nashv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/nashv.jpg</a>
But I'm no expert and maybe I'm making a fool of myself.<p>But going back to the author's intention, I read the sentence I quoted several times, and I still don't know what his preference is. The fact that he said ""most dramatic"" makes me think he prefer the one on the right?<p>With respect to using the golden ratio in design. I am a designer. I've never used the golden ratio, but I understand the desire to. As design is discipline with very few rules, we latch onto anything concrete, whether the benefits are real or imaginary. Otherwise it just feels like shooting in the dark. While I'm agnostic on whether the golden ratio is actually objectively attractive or not, the benefits of using a framework like this I find to be invaluable.<p>Here is what I mean: lets say you use the golden ratio to layout out a blog, i.e., place the logo, main content, sidebar, etc... Then you use the golden ratio again to layout an individual blog post, i.e., the header, the text of the post, maybe a pull quote, and some inline images. Now you've done something I can attest to the benefits of, because you've created a harmonious repetition of proportion through-out the design. When I look back at my own design work, the strongest dividing line between the work I am proud of and the work I am no longer proud of, is just this. When I started using a concrete system to repeat proportion through out the design, to my admittedly subjective eye, the quality of my design work greatly increased.",1308338390

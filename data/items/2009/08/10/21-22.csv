(Maybe they are not malicious, but I consider their security measures to be sub-par.)<p>If domain X starts referencing material from domain Y within its secure pages, I would like to be aware of this.  My understanding is that once such material is incorporated into the browser-constructed page representation, it has full access to that representation.  If the inclusion is a component that has the ability to control the browser (e.g. a script), then that component can observe or manipulate the page and its activity.<p>That is one reason not to trust an https page that includes content references/retrieved via http; the latter is easily subjected to a man in the middle attack.<p>The technique described in the article avoids this point, but it doesn't describe what if any notice browsers provide to the user that a second, authenticated domain/certificate is involved in the current communication.<p>Maybe I'm incorrect in my understanding (I'm no expert in this, by any means).  But this is what forms the basis of my question.<p>Edit:  I'll leave my question as a testament to my over-tired, over-caffeinated rashness.  I take your point now, more fully, that specifying a link having the protocol prefixed, as opposed to this, will produce the same result end in the browser.<p>So, I guess my question reduces to a ""browser 101"" question of what does happen under those circumstances, with regard to browser presentation.

""I want to be able to push a button and turn a specification into a program"" is too vague to be useful--interpreted literally it already describes the compilers we have today, and interpreted liberally it could mean anything from ""languages aren't high level enough"" to ""programming is too hard"" to ""I want to express programs with pretty pictures and by answering questionnaires"" to ""I want to compile English"". Now, if we rule out ""I want to compile English"" as a very bad and stupid idea, we're left with things that, quite frankly, we've been researching the whole time (with the possible exception of compilers that question ambiguous expressions).

It is pretty important to avoid e.g. treating a boolean as a pointer, but since the language itself didn't offer any way to distinguish between these types, it was proposed to encode type info in the variable names. So pointer variables was prefixed with ptr, booleans with b and so on.

754120,comment,753921,754041,0,0,ajg1977,,,"Once upon a time a Hungarian chap named Simonyi invented a system of prefixing variables with letters to describe their type. This was actually a very good idea since at the time computer programs were rapidly growing in size and complexity, and developers did not have any of the fancy IDE features nor large high-resolution screens that we take for granted today.<p>However as with many good ideas it was became taken to excess and and variables eventually became less readable - e.g. m_spszName would be a member variable, that is static, and is a pointer to a zero-terminated string. It did not help that people often disagreed the order of prefixes, or only used a subset of the full range.<p>With the advent of better type-checking compilers and languages, intellisense IDE features, and screens that could display more than 80 lines Hungarian notation largely faded away.<p>The 'C' prefix was originated (I think by MFC) to signify that a type was a class. Ironically it began around the time that strict Hungarian notation began to fade out, and classes became liberally used in code.<p>There are still many good reasons to use certain prefix's on your variable ('m' for member being the most widely used) but things like CFoo or pszName are largely antiquated relics of a past time.<p>It just gave me a little chuckle when I saw it :)",1249940103

Your example is just showing that the extended module only appears in the instance&#x27;s singleton class, this has nothing to do with method cache. It&#x27;s how the method cache is implemented that matters. The new method caching changes can&#x27;t be seen from user code.<p>I&#x27;m curious as to whether the ruby-core team implemented method caches for every Object in the system (eg: every instance of User would then have its own method cache because they all would have their own singleton classes) or just objects that are instances of the Class class. I seem to doubt that the former happened because it seems like it would be expensive to maintain a cache for <i>every</i> object, that means a normal Rails request that generates 65,000 strings would all have their own method caches. Only instances of the Class class having their own method caches sounds more reasonable from a performance standpoint to me.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve been trying to get an answer about this from a ruby-core member, although my attempts have been quite lazy through Twitter.",1399384631

And it was before Prop 8 aimed to change the constitution to strip equal protection from gay people. Which is why those paying for Prop 8 are literally guilty of trying to break up existing families.<p>You might believe permanent cohabitation between gay people is different, just like most people who were opposed to interracial marriage. But, in both cases, it&#x27;s not materially different with respect to civil marriage. Not with regards to equal protection, because no anti-gay bigot has been able to demonstrate in court a rational basis for making that distinction. And not in my experience, where what I see is just like what I see when I visit my straight friends. Happy couples and struggling couples; childless couples and couples with happy, laughing children. Children who deserve society&#x27;s protection, just like any others.<p>Regarding the last bit, you can&#x27;t claim half of society on that. An ever-declining portion of society is anxious, concerned, confused, or misled on gay marriage. I have lots of compassion for them. There are also some people who believe it&#x27;s against what their god(s) want, but correctly recognized that using the power of the state to impose their religious views on others is wrong. Them, I appreciate.<p>There are <i>also</i> some bigots -- a much smaller number than the other groups -- who say hateful and false things, as you have. They, and you, can go fuck yourselves. We survived the much greater social upheavals of reducing anti-black bias; we&#x27;ll certainly make it through accommodating the smaller number of homosexuals.

Constant sales basically tell the customer that the sale price is the real price and you&#x27;re a sucker if you pay full price... but you have to constantly check and watch and do a bunch of extra work to be sure you get the real (sale) price.<p>Please, just have a price and charge it. I know, I know, it&#x27;s better for your metrics to practice price discrimination, and constant sales are a way to do that... but it pisses off customers who just want a simple, fair price. If you really need price discrimination, add &quot;enterprise&quot; features and let people who want throw money at you pay for things no one really needs. Just don&#x27;t make me stop in the process of buying something because I know the price isn&#x27;t actually the price and I have to wait until the price is corrected to the real price with a sale (and likely never actually remember to come back when the sale is on).<p>Having frequent free shipping sales creates the same effect.

What comes out is gibberish, as any technical person can confirm.”</i><p><i>And by enlisting the NSA to shore up their defenses, those companies may have made themselves more vulnerable to the agency’s efforts to breach them for surveillance purposes.</i><p><i>“I think the public should be concerned about whether the NSA was really making its best efforts, as the emails claim, to help secure enterprise BIOS and mobile devices and not holding the best vulnerabilities close to their chest,” said Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s digital civil liberties team.</i><p><i>He doesn’t doubt that the NSA was trying to secure enterprise BIOS, but he suggested that the agency, for its own purposes, was “looking for weaknesses in the exact same products they’re trying to secure.”</i><p><i>The NSA “has no business helping Google secure its facilities from the Chinese and at the same time hacking in through the back doors and tapping the fiber connections between Google base centers,” Cardozo said. “The fact that it’s the same agency doing both of those things is in obvious contradiction and ridiculous.” He recommended dividing offensive and defensive functions between two agencies.</i><p><i>Two weeks after the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; broadcast, the German magazine Der Spiegel, citing documents obtained by Snowden, reported that the NSA had inserted backdoors into BIOS, doing exactly what Plunkett accused a “nation state” of doing during her interview.</i>",1399383455

But the fact is that in the rest of the economy, technology has enabled consolidation and driven small businesses either into closing down or being acquired. Technology pushes out the boundary at which diseconomies of scale overtake economies of scale, enabling larger businesses to be more efficient.<p>Take a company like Amazon or Wal-Mart. Technology enables those companies to operate at massive scales, and using technology, they can replace thousands of smaller businesses while operating much more efficiently.<p>I suppose the other relevant trend has been what has happened in the financial markets. 1978-present was a period of massive M&A activity.

As an actual american I only write about three or four checks per year, everything else is online.<p>We do pull and push.<p>Pulls are an unholy PITA to set up where you give them all kinds of personally identifiable information which they hopefully won&#x27;t lose, then they make multiple couple cent deposits to your account, then you tell them what the amounts were and they tell the bank, which creates a certain relationship which in the Future is very historical trust based.  So click here on your car insurance site to make your biannual car insurance payment exactly like the last 20 payments (well, slightly different amounts, but ...)  Ditto the mortgage website, the electric bill, a couple others.  Basically very long term relationships, I&#x27;m unlikely to just randomly stop paying the monopoly electricity provider.  This is a direct acct to acct transfer.<p>Pushes are easy to set up but more of a pain to use on a monthly basis.  No one has control over pushes other than yourself.  You send money to a postal address, and who knows what they do on the back end, individual old fashioned checks or batch up or wire transfers who knows.  This is more for credit cards or temporary less formal associations.  You go to your bank website, tell them the postal address (they&#x27;ll save it for later use) tell them how much, click send, off it goes.<p>Speaking generically, most USA people use credit cards or paypal or the zillions of small time competitors when someone wants money from them, and they interface with the bank for you.  So Paypal can eat money directly out of my checking acct to send cash, up to certain limits.  This is vaguely ATM like, sort of a web interface to a ATM.  Or it just gets added to the CC balance.  So it would be really weird for me to pay directly for gasoline or even food, I generally CC that, and then send one very large &quot;push&quot; bill payment from the bank to the CC per month.<p>So Americans mostly do electronic pushes, pulls, and aggregators online, although we do have checks for non-electronic people.<p>I write a check to the school district for book + other fees, like $50 per year per kid.  Technically its illegal to demand payment for free public schools but the PTO spends it on &quot;free&quot; after school activities so its kinda a donation and I think we get our monies worth.  Also my wife buys an organic grown fraction of a cow from a local farmer every year or so, and the butcher shop takes electronic for processing but the old school farmer still does paper checks.  Some tradesmen (plumber, carpenter) only take old fashioned paper checks, although that is very rapidly changing as they all get smart phones.  I switched to a CU probably 7 to 10 years ago and since then I&#x27;ve written a couple dozen checks total, I&#x27;d have to find it to verify because I keep it locked up.<p>Some really old people, like non-computational, obviously write a lot of checks.  I have an elderly uncle who had to pay an extra bank fee for writing more than two dozen a month, which seems weird to me.<p>Poor people with serious legal / financial issues are unbanked and mostly go pure cash.  There&#x27;s a whole industry grown around ripping off those people when they try to interface semi-legally with the financial system.  This is probably less than 1/4 the population.  Like if you owe child support or a court judgment, all your electronic money will simply disappear, but not your cash, leading to some peculiar behaviors.",1399382119

When truck drivers had powerful unions (today, many unions are corrupt and weak, with union leadership buddied up to management) and made what would be six-figure salaries today, while living in houses where the land was effectively free (i.e. the cost of the house was the construction cost alone), it was possible for people in the middle class to accrue real savings. College tuitions were reasonable, because you could get a good job from a (well-funded, cheap) state school and so there wasn&#x27;t an arms race to get into elite colleges.<p>The idea that a working-class family could bankroll a business seems insane now, but it wasn&#x27;t, 30 years ago.

The Coursera cryptography course was quite good in general.<p>More in depth: I definitely picked up some concepts in the lectures that I watched. I thought they were better than normal university lectures, mostly because you could skip ahead through them. But in general I think that for me, long assignments are a much more valuable teaching method, and most of the courses I followed/looked at had much too simple multiple choice fact-based questions for the practical part.",1399381385

All banks I&#x27;m familiar with use 2 levels of authorization: 1 to log in, 1 to authorize payment.<p>I have 2 bank accounts. One with ING (a major Dutch/international bank), which uses a password (without special characters unfortunately) to log in, and an authorization code to authorize payment. In my case, that authorization code comes from a piece of paper with a bunch of one-time codes on it. This is an old system that dates back to when you called them directly by modem, rather than over internet. Nowadays I could also have the code sent to my phone. But phones can also be stolen, so I don&#x27;t see the point.<p>My other account (at Triodos, a much smaller Dutch bank) uses a pin + hardware token at both stages.

3906097,comment,3905832,3905832,18,0,overgard,,,"I wonder if it's really about the graphics though, or if it's more about the mystery of what's possible. Let's imagine something called the ""possibility space"", which is just roughly the set of things you can do in the game. Minecraft has a really large possibility space (build stuff, mine, survive, etc), Quake has a much smaller one (shoot things, navigate). Gameplay is largely about discovering what's possible, and then using that knowledge to achieve mastery over the system.<p>When you're young and you see a vista like that in ninja gaiden,  you're intrigued by the possibility of what could be out there and what you can do with it. As you play, you discover the system, and in doing so, you also discover the limits of the system, and eventually as the space of possibilities becomes sharply defined, it eventually becomes uninteresting.<p>When you see a new game with prettier graphics, what the graphics imply is a new possibility space; a sense that more can happen here and the universe of possibilities is expanded.<p>The thing is, the graphics are secondary to what they imply about expanded gameplay. Graphics are feedback. Feedback is essential to gameplay, but it has to be evaluated in terms of a larger system.<p>I think this is largely why modern games seem a bit less magical than the old ones. They imply a lot of possibilities, but they rarely deliver; in fact, to support that level of graphics and polish they have to sharply reduce the space of what's possible. To display beautiful lighting you have to prerender a lot of it, or to show a greatly scripted cutscene you have to ensure that the player can't do something that would make that scene no longer make sense. But all of that reduces what the player can do, and how the world can respond to it.",1335711178

Status calculations are a fundamental human behavior, and social systems tend to move in directions of class and hierarchy.

Consider also that absolute salary differences matter less for happiness than relative salary differences, which is economically insane but very human.)<p>I strongly believe that a lot of corporate idiocy is driven by hidden status games. E.g., the way that managers often have status in proportion to the size of budget or staff, which gives an incentive away from maximum efficiency.<p>Unconventional approaches to management push against this.

My brain just doesn't work well with them it seems.<p>There is this uncanny valley thing where the scenery becomes so realistic that the very small incorrect details really start to jump out and become distracting. Sometimes even annoying to a point where I can't stand playing a game any longer.<p>It's strange really, but when a game goes for extreme realism, it feels as if my brain is expecting the game world to be a carbon copy of 'the great outside'. It's only in these situations that any tiny discrepancy really jumps out at you. This is not the case with art which is obviously stylized.<p>edit: What makes this even stranger is that I have very poor eyesight (congenital Glaucoma). I can't see the difference between DVD's of olden days and stuff made and displayed in 1020p HD.

Unless your workload is perfectly regular, specialization leads to bottlenecking and global underutilization.<p>I'd also consider how Toyota, the world's #1 car company, looks at this. They do an immense amount of crosstraining, and line workers are specifically discouraged from specializing too much.

I work on a huge project that's hosted on Repo (full Android OS + big proprietary driver tree), and the lack of this feature has really cost me lots of time doing manual labor that could be automated.<p>Another decision the Repo designers made that I disagree with is the silly Change-Id added to every commit message(!). Since when do globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) solve problems instead of creating more?",1335708121

408008,comment,407674,407895,0,0,qaexl,,,"That doesn't really have much to do with the article. It's actually about a freelancer trying three different time management techniques, including the ones found in 4HWK. It was meant to be tongue-in-cheek. In fact, the author said, 
""Ferriss' system basically amounts to finding ways to avoid doing your work."" which I imagine you'd appreciate it for its intended humor.<p>With regards to the social implications of 4HWK, As had been said in many of the comments here about it, the idea is to be able to do what you want to do, whether it is to indulge in what you consider as fantasies, or to throw yourself back into doing another time-consuming, socially-productive startup.<p>I think you underestimate the difficulty of having nothing to do. In those moments, there is nothing to distract you from taking a good, hard look at yourself. There are many things that come up, assumptions about what is socially acceptable (getting a job) and what is not gets examined. I've done a bit of that in the past before, and I recognize it in Ferris's words at the beginning of his book. If after going on this imposed exile for a year, you come out of it going after a new dream, or a new project, that is often more true to yourself than running around being ""productive"". It is the equivalent of reaching the self-acualization stage of Maslow's ladder, and being ready to go beyond that. This experience is life-changing enough that I think people should have the opportunity to give it a try. Yes, it requires the cooperation of other people helping you out. What of it?<p>The other side of it is that American society may value egalitarian hard-work, but much of the middle-class affluence is founded on those living in harsher working conditions. Basic things as simple as running water, toilet paper, nutritionally-balanced meals, junk food, iPhones and news.ycombinator.com are all taken for granted here. They are not universally available. It is one thing to criticize Ferris's method for resembling an unsustainable Ponzi scheme, it is quite another to describe it as indulging in fantasies and gloficiation of no-work when the average, mainstream American middle-class is affluent by world standards.",1230062048

I don't understand it.<p>At one point in the book, Ferriss himself (indirectly) provides the explanation for why his own book focuses so much on <i>his</i> particular experiences and goals: He prefers to read books written by people that have <i>actual experience doing something</i>, rather than theoretical extrapolations. And so he's written such a book. He offers you a recipe for doing what he did because <i>that's what he knows how to do</i>. What more can you ask from one book? If you want a book about how to live a happy life as a hacker or a priest, perhaps you need to <i>buy a second book</i>.<p>To me, the fact that Ferriss has a very different personality from mine is a big selling point.

408000,comment,407241,407572,0,0,mattobrien,,,"How is it actually very different from Japan-style deflation? The problem is that as the credit bubble has popped, prices across the board are falling, and consumers are so scared that even relatively well-off people are cutting back on consumption.<p>And once deflationary expectations set in, it's very difficult to rid the economy of them. For example, if you expect housing prices to fall even more, it makes sense to wait a few months for them to do so. If enough people act this way, deflationary expectations become self-justifying, and prices could keep falling even beyond the fundamentals. And while individuals benefit from their dollars having increasing buying power, this is more than offset by the fact that in the face of falling demand, companies will have to slash payrolls, either through benefit reduction or layoffs. This is in turn lowers demand, deteriorating the business environment even more. And this is to say nothing of the fact that people's debts become larger in real terms during deflation, likely causing more defaults of all sorts.<p>The shadow banking system refers to financial institutions that act like banks - ie borrow short, and lend long, oftentimes in illiquid assets - but don't have the protections that banks do, most importantly depositor insurance. Consequently, institutions like investment banks or hedge funds can still experience the equivalent of bank runs. Bear Stearns was a perfect example of this.",1230061713

That doesn't mean that there's not good stuff to be learned after you sift through the self-promoting crap in the book.<p>Tidbits I picked up:<p>*  Throw a quick 3 page website up as a sales letter to market a $100 product.  Point $200 worth of ad-sense at it over 10 days to see if you get any uptake.  If you have more than 2 signups or ""buy-ins"", you've past the break even point and you're on the road to making money.<p>*   Focus on developing a $50-150 priced product.  You don't have to sell a ton of those products to make a decent living for yourself.<p>*   100 units sold * $100 = replace my monthly income.<p>*   Focus intensely on what's going to make you cash.  All the cool technology you're building doesn't matter to your business unless it helps the bottom line.  This was apropos to me, because I have an acute case of...  oh, look at this shiny new thing.  Focusing on what makes money helps cut through some of that.<p>*   People like to buy things.  No, really.  They like to pay for things.  It makes them feel better about their lives.  So, if you offer them a compelling reason to give you money, they will probably give you the money.<p>*   Outsource as much as you can that isn't non-core business.  e.g. Hire interns to do marketing and PR work for you.  Outsource writing your copy. Outsource design work, outsource product development if appropriate.  Outsource market research, outsource date finding, outsource travel plans, outsource, outsource, outsource everything away to make your life simpler.<p>*   Filter out distractions as much as possible. i.e. no meetings, minimal email.<p>*   Have balls.  No, really, dude hacked a martial arts festival and won.  Why?  By hacking the weigh-in legally.  He has a lot of legal cons that help you hack the publicity system.  Put your balls to use by hacking a social structure and rules in a situation to your benefit.  If you don't have the balls to try something, you're not going to achieve it.<p>*  Chase the big dreams.  Life is too short.  If you want a Lotus Elise, test drive it, and find out how much you'd have to make a month to pay for it.  Figure out how to make that money.  If you want to go to Figi, figure out the cost, make the money to get there and then just go.",1230061678

407991,comment,117118,117237,0,0,danmatern,,,"thanks for helping me think.<p>I hope that my opinion about trolls is worthwhile, and hopefully will be corrected if it's not.  What I observed, but didn't hear directly stated: trolls feel threatened.
For whatever reason, unfamiliarity sends some folks into a state of neurosis, an upsetting of their equilibrium.<p>I think of a troll partly in the case of the Three Billy Goats sense: the troll is an owner of a critical pathway.  He collects tolls (tribute) a/or has a reputation to uphold in performing his daily routine.  He is defining and defending the status quo.  If he sees that you wish to build a new alternative (bridge), this threatens his current monopoly. Instead of scaling his current operations and building new bridges, outsourcing the admin of them, and franchising the operation, he wants NO NEW BRIDGES. Perhaps he inherited his power, or wrested it away in a primitive sense.  Any evolution of methods that doesn't go the way he likes, he will thwart, dismiss, or destroy.  Perhaps it's bullying, not to defend the troll, but to see things from his perspective: he was bullied, and overcame bullies to get where he is now.  All he sees are threats and he doesn't want to play any new games.  If you owned the phone lines, perhaps you're seeing wireless that way.<p>To return to your point: trolls aren't interested in learning new things about stuff outside their field.  They aren't nomadic like the goats, so they see goats as merely trespassers, competitors, or as victims.  Not as neighbors, partners, or customers.  That would take a more open mind.<p>Part of rudeness is not knowing how really rude one is; the other part is not caring.  Back to the old joke of when the punk is asked ""are you ignorant or apathetic ?""  he replies ""I don't know and I don't care !""  Perhaps it's natural that trolls see life as a zero-sum competition.",1230061462

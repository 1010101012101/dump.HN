Not in a negative sense, but as if more of a cultural thing. It does not surprise me that PG speech about startup hubs might have offended many in the audience, even though the offense was obviously not intended. <p>If the situation were reversed and PG came from the UK to give that talk in SV, I dont think many would have been offended on terms of national pride. I suspect many startup entrepreneurs from SV would not hesitate moving to a different city in another country if it greatly increased their prospects of success.

Okay, I'm tired of beating around the bush. I'm a beautiful 
(spectacularly beautiful) 25 year old girl. I'm articulate and classy. 
I'm not from New York. I'm looking to get married to a guy who makes at 
least half a million a year. I know how that sounds, but keep in mind 
that a million a year is middle class in New York City, so I don't think 
I'm overreaching at all. <p>Are there any guys who make 500K or more on this board? Any wives? Could 
you send me some tips? I dated a business man who makes average around 
200 - 250. But that's where I seem to hit a roadblock. 250,000 won't get 
me to central park west. I know a woman in my yoga class who was married 
to an investment banker and lives in Tribeca, and she's not as pretty as 
I am, nor is she a great genius. So what is she doing right? How do I 
get to her level? <p>Here are my questions specifically: <p>- Where do you single rich men hang out? Give me specifics- bars, 
restaurants, gyms <p>- What are you looking for in a mate? Be honest guys, you won't hurt my 
feelings <p>- Is there an age range I should be targeting (I'm 25)? <p>- Why are some of the women living lavish lifestyles on the upper east 
side so plain? I've seen really 'plain jane' boring types who have 
nothing to offer married to incredibly wealthy guys. I've seen drop dead 
gorgeous girls in singles bars in the east village. What's the story 
there? <p>- Jobs I should look out for? Everyone knows - lawyer, investment 
banker, doctor. How much do those guys really make? And where do they 
hang out? Where do the hedge fund guys hang out? <p>- How you decide marriage vs. just a girlfriend? I am looking for 
MARRIAGE ONLY <p>Please hold your insults - I'm putting myself out there in an honest 
way. Most beautiful women are superficial; at least I'm being up front 
about it. I wouldn't be searching for these kind of guys if I wasn't 
able to match them - in looks, culture, sophistication, and keeping a 
nice home and hearth. <p>* it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or 
other commercial interests <p>PostingID: 432279810 <p>THE ANSWER <p>Dear Pers-431649184: <p>I read your posting with great interest and have thought meaningfully 
about your dilemma. I offer the following analysis of your predicament. 
Firstly, I'm not wasting your time, I qualify as a guy who fits your 
bill; that is I make more than $500K per year. That said here's how I 
see it. <p>Your offer, from the prospective of a guy like me, is plain and simple a 
cr@ppy business deal. Here's why. Cutting through all the B.S., what you 
suggest is a simple trade: you bring your looks to the party and I bring 
my money. Fine, simple. But here's the rub, your looks will fade and my 
money will likely continue into perpetuity...in fact, it is very likely 
that my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you won't 
be getting any more beautiful! <p>So, in economic terms you are a depreciating asset and I am an earning 
asset. Not only are you a depreciating asset, your depreciation 
accelerates! Let me explain, you're 25 now and will likely stay pretty 
hot for the next 5 years, but less so each year. Then the fade begins in 
earnest. By 35 stick a fork in you! <p>So in Wall Street terms, we would call you a trading position, not a buy 
and hold...hence the rub...marriage. It doesn't make good business sense 
to ""buy you"" (which is what you're asking) so I'd rather lease. In case 
you think I'm being cruel, I would say the following. If my money were 
to go away, so would you, so when your beauty fades I need an out. It's 
as simple as that. So a deal that makes sense is dating, not marriage. <p>Separately, I was taught early in my career about efficient markets. So, 
I wonder why a girl as ""articulate, classy and spectacularly beautiful"" 
as you has been unable to find your sugar daddy. I find it hard to 
believe that if you are as gorgeous as you say you are that the $500K 
hasn't found you, if not only for a tryout. <p>By the way, you could always find a way to make your own money and then 
we wouldn't need to have this difficult conversation. <p>With all that said, I must say you're going about it the right way. 
Classic ""pump and dump."" 
I hope this is helpful, and if you want to enter into some sort of 
lease, let me know.",1192045382

65925,comment,65923,65923,0,0,acgourley,,,"At some point I was thinking of building a quick site to allow people to list/give/swap domain names with a small community of developers. My rational is that many of us sit on a pile of them we bought for past or never-to-be completed ideas, and we could help each other out by making them available. It would be cool if someone did build that side one day, but for now it probably makes more sense to just piggyback on an existing community. <p>Of course I just had several names expire before I thought to do this, but I'm willing to part with:<p>dealray.com
mobophile.com
mobozen.com<p>I'm not looking for money, but I will ask that you actually plan on using the domain for something cool somewhat soon. The transfer of a domain off 1and1 is a mild pita after all.

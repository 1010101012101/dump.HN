9868160,comment,9865845,9867036,0,0,kemiller2002,,,"Sure, Dr. Kent Khiel on the study of FMRIs and people fitting the profiles of psychopathy.  There is significant evidence that people who are true psychopaths (as in those who aren&#x27;t misdiagnosed) suffer a deficiency in the anterior cingulate cortex which relates to things like emotional regulation and learned behaviors (Robert Hare has shown that psychopaths show a deficiency in understanding things like fear of a negative outcome).  The book the author notes says this is anecdotal except that the research has been going on for quite some time, and there have been several studies conducted.<p>Now the author argues that the main study of brain anatomy and behavior is based on people who are incarcerated, and this to a certain extent is true. However there are also cases where people who aren&#x27;t in jail have gotten FMRIs and exhibit the same types of behavior.  James Fallon is a prime example (he has an article about him in the Smithsonian).  He&#x27;s a neuroscientist and fully admits that he fits the profile.<p>The author states that it can&#x27;t be a disorder, because it only equates to life experiences, but from a sociological perspective this can disproved.  Psychopathy has been noted across different cultures and socioeconomic barriers.  Plus, if life experience was purely the cause, one could stand to argue that psychopathy would be significantly weighted towards one culture, economic upbringing etc.  It&#x27;s not.  Why would a kid with loving parents become a psychopath.....and his brother with similar experiences not.  Look up the Ranes brothers.  One of them is definitely a serial killer, and the other is (was) also serving a life sentence for murder....except there is evidence that the second isn&#x27;t a psychopath even though he was convicted.  There is a lot of evidence that showed it was possible he was wrongly convicted and he doesn&#x27;t fit the profile.  They had horrible childhoods and if upbringing was to be a significant indicator, this could disprove that rule as the brothers should similarly.<p>The article says something about a study which shows that psychopaths can &quot;turn their emotions on an off&quot; (I remember reading the article but not specifics).  Kevin Dutton argues that psychopaths are essentially predators and yes, they can understand emotion.  That&#x27;s how they are capable of finding people they can take advantage of.  Plus it&#x27;s one study, and if it can&#x27;t be verified then it&#x27;s not a very strong case.  There was also a study recently which the author stated that he was able to help true psychopaths (not just people who have been diagnosed as APD) using behavioral therapy.  This would lead to suggest that if that works, then it&#x27;s behavioral and not neurological, but once again, it&#x27;s only one article.<p>What really gets me is the last paragraph, declaring them as &quot;evil&quot; and because of that they must be the &quot;boogey man&quot;  Labeling someone as a psychopath based on the criteria actually humanizes them, and makes them someone who should be kind of pitied.  They&#x27;re dangerous and they do bad things, but if the neurological evidence is correct, they really don&#x27;t understand.  They aren&#x27;t capable of understanding right and wrong like the rest of us.  Saying that disorder is a myth really turns these people into monsters, because it means that we are assuming they have the same range of emotions as the rest of society and they choose to ignore what they know is right and wrong.  Personally, I think that is a cop out answer to allow people to get mad and take revenge on people who may not understand at an emotional level what they are doing with a clear conscience.  That&#x27;s just me though.",1436579917

Thus if there was no blatant relationship between these events, and none were elaborated or clearly argued for, then what is the rule for applying this whole &quot;integrity in journalism argument&quot; => &quot;gamergate&quot; => BS chain of logic? If there is none, then by definition, it can be applied anywhere.

However, it&#x27;s still a language that&#x27;s meant to be written and spoken by humans, which comes with limitations and drawbacks (i.e., binary is extremely flexible and powerful, but not practical to speak and write by a human). It offers no real innovation as far as semantics goes.<p>What I&#x27;m researching is knowledge representation, independently from any physical representation or implementation. Mainly, how to represent facts and intention. The semantic web (linked-data) is very close to what I have in mind as far as facts representation goes. However, it seems to completely ignore the intentional aspect of communication (x wants y because z).<p>It is not difficult to represent &quot;This pizza costs $10&quot; or &quot;I want this pizza&quot; in RDF (semantic web language). However, that&#x27;s a naive and simplistic way to think about the situation. It&#x27;s should be more like a semantic contract:<p>Person A broadcasts this promise (offer):<p>- Person B owns Pizza X<p>- Person A owns $10<p>Person B broadcasts this promise (demand):<p>- Person B owns Pizza X<p>Matchmaking algorithm finds a match (2 people that share similar promises). In this case, both share the &quot;Person B owns Pizza X&quot; statement. However, since all promise statements must be true, Person B has to agree to add &quot;Person A owns $10&quot; to its promise. Once both have identical promises, the contract is sealed. Now, both users are responsible for making these promises (future truths) become reality. The contract is complete when reality matches these promises, and the trust score of both individuals is increased (trust score, like a credit score, determines how reliable people are at respecting promises aka predicting the future). This &quot;trust score&quot; also happens to become the future currency.<p>We must realize that all communication is about describing either actual truths or future truths. Contracts are simply endorsement of a set of future truths. Whether the truths you endorse become reality or not affects your credibility, and therefore the value of your endorsements. All we need is a framework to communicate these things, and nothing more. That should eliminate 80% of apps we use today, and reduce communication noise significantly.<p>Of course that&#x27;s a gross simplification that probably doesn&#x27;t answer your question.",1436578282

If sexism is a plausible cause, and calling it what it is helps to eliminate it, then let&#x27;s do that.<p>Kindness does not cancel out or excuse vitriol.

But at the same time, I find the MRA shrill talking-points to be of a pretty shallow depth, and, as a group, they&#x27;re pretty vocally violent. In contrast, I find feminist talking-points to have a fair amount of depth to them. Those feminists who conduct themselves in the shrill manner that MRAs do are just as bad, but when you take those kinds of people away and look at what&#x27;s left over, it&#x27;s quite different.<p>So how should you counter people you don&#x27;t like? Well, by trying to be mature, and if you fail, trying for better next time. Death threats and rape threats are never okay. Especially if the person in question is not forcing themselves into your life - people <i>go to</i> reddit, reddit does not force themselves into living rooms and makes you read it, nor do many people pay for it.<p>For the record, I am a white male. I loathe the MRA crowd because they&#x27;re purely reactionary. Men do have systemic social issues that need addressing, but in general, the MRA crowd isn&#x27;t actually interested in exploring, discussing, and addressing the issues. Instead, they use men&#x27;s issues as a weapon with which to beat down discussion that other people are having; there is very little that is proactive in that crowd. For example, here on HN, pretty much all the men&#x27;s rights stuff has been presented as some sort of counterpoint to a perceived feminist slight... yet these same shrill voices that demand we pay attention to the issues faced by men... never post articles in their own right, only weaponised comments to win internet points.<p>Threats of violence are never okay unless you&#x27;re being physically threatened. Immature commentary should never be at the forefront of a social movement, since it&#x27;s never going to solve root causes and can only provide a superficial salve. These things are destructive, and are all about making the other side lose - an ideal outcome is a win-win situation, though that&#x27;s not always possible, of course.",1436576755

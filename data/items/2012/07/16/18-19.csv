Manufacturers voluntarily register their products with EPEAT, listing which of the required and optional criteria the devices meet. EPEAT then reviews the registration, and can have the rating reduced or removed at its discretion. According to Kyle, EPEAT hasn't yet reviewed Apple's registration for the Retina MacBook Pro...EPEAT CEO Robert Frisbee said last week that ""flexibility within specified parameters"" is one way the group could ""reward innovations that are not yet envisioned with standards.""</i>",1342465189

WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO STOP TALKING ABOUT EDITORS PEOPLE! Start ups fail because you are solving a problem that doesn't need to be solved, you can't find product-market fit, you have a shitty UI that no one can figure out, your applications are slow or have crazy down-time, or you fail to reach enough of your market to sustain a functioning business model, etc.<p>None of the problems are code.

4251894,comment,4251011,4251011,32,0,l3amm,,,"As a start-up CEO in the hiring-efficiency space, I get to see a lot of company's hiring process in gory detail. Anyone who's been around new start-ups (and old guys, see: Google) has seen a great candidate withdraw from a req due to long response time. In a larger organization these inefficiencies can be handled by adding more schedulers, sourcers, recruiters, but in a small start-up you need a top-down commitment to speedy processing of candidates.<p>As a company gets larger (~series A) there comes a sudden crunch wherein you need 10 developers, yesterday. At that moment, if you haven't laid down the ground work for a successful recruiting/hiring strategy you can experience a very lossy hiring process. You'll miss out on great opportunities to companies who have spent the time, money and effort to make their process efficient.<p>To the articles recommendations, I would add the following:<p>- For top tier talent, recruiting is more like sales: you need to sell your company to the recruit, not vice versa.<p>- For each requisition do the following: decide what the relevant skills/requirements for the position, decide who on the interview team will assess each of those skills, train your interviewers to spend 1/2 their time selling the company and why they love working there and 1/2 their time grilling the applicant on their focus area. This forces you to think critically about what you're looking for (forces understanding of the org chart) and gives each person agency in the process (I'm in charge of sussing out algorithmic ability).<p>- Corollary to the above: train your interviewers. Make sure they know what they're looking for both culturally and technically, and make sure they have the ability to assess those properties (or lack thereof). Interviewers are your company's brand emissaries (and the source of many candidates) if they can't communicate well the recruits will come away with a bad experience.<p>- Track things: I think of recruiting like sales. If a VC asked you how your sales was going you wouldn't say something like ""OK"", you'd have numbers, metrics, graphs, funnels, pipelines, etc etc. Though this can feel a bit overkill in the beginning, getting in the habit of monitoring your candidate pipeline is extremely important as you scale. Small inefficiencies become enshrined as 'best practice' and as you scale they can turn into huge holes for your organization. This is exactly the type of problem we're trying to mitigate/measure by bringing the traditional applicant tracking system into the inbox at www.foundryhiring.com.",1342463643

I don't believe American corporate tax is lower.<p>If he doesn't incorporate, or if incorporates and pays out salary from his corporation to himself, he is taxed personally. The Danish income taxation is on a progressive scale, ranging from around 10 percent to around 60 percent but again with quite good possibilities for deductions. As a rule of thumb, most people end up paying little more than 40 percent of their total income, even if it exceeds USD 100,000. I don't think the combined federal tax, state tax in California and social security is much lower than that.<p>As an American citizen, the US would tax him on his world wide income although he is no longer resident in the US. But there are different possibilities for tax deductions such as the foreign earned income exclusion for the first USD 95,100 made abroad. Also, there is a double taxation treaty between the US and Denmark which may take care of any taxes exceeding the USD 95,100.<p>Anyways, he would have to talk to both a Danish and an American CPA about that. It would be very expensive. In my experience, tax planning is for large corporations, not for the rest of us.",1342463540

This stuff isn't hard, but for some reason, most security researchers know fuck-all about how to test and exploit crypto bugs. Don't take too much offense; I was in the same bucket until a few years ago (and I'm not far from it even now), and I've been a researcher since 1994.<p>ECB is the default mode not because people choose overtly to make it the default mode, but because it requires no parameters to make it work. Look at a generalist programmer's cryptosystem. Flip a coin. Did it come up heads? It's ECB mode, because that's the moral default.<p>Nothing I'm talking about involves ""several million ciphertexts"".<p>Nothing I'm talking about involves side channels --- at least, not precision measuring side channels. ""Side channel attacks"" are the voodoo totem that security researchers wave around when they don't know a specific attack that will break a cryptosystem. Sort of like not knowing how to pick a lock a pin at a time, but talking about ""bump keys"".<p>Nothing I'm talking about even involves the attacker knowing for sure what algorithm the defender used. We test for this stuff black box; it takes less than a week to train people to do it.<p>No, I'm not going to provide more details here. Not because I jealously guard this stuff (I've written most of this stuff on HN before, and I've given talks about it that are recorded online), but because every time I get into a thread like this, someone comes back and says ""oh yeah well THAT attack is LAME and I assumed that any smart developer would already have defended against it"" and I'd rather reveal ignorance for what it is.<p>ECB will fall in seconds in most situations. If you knew how to test crypto, you'd know that none of these attacks ""retrieve keys"". Again: don't take offense. People way smarter than me don't know this stuff.

Friends were just around all the time.<p>Also looking back, all of my good memories are people an experiences, not money, projects, or things - all of which education and the real world focus you on.<p>Now that I'm 28 and have a family, it is difficult to spend time with friends - even the ones with families as well. Everyone has jobs and lots of other commitments.<p>By now most of my college friends have moved away and even the ones that haven't I rarely see.<p>These days I make a conscious effort to attend anything I possibly can with friends, and it certainly helps.<p>My point is that if there are any high school/college aged people reading my advice is that you take advantage of every opportunity with friends now. Focus on quality and quantity of relationships. If you have a choice between a ""B"" on a project if you go out with friends and an ""A"" if you stay home and study, pick the former.

You don't get to say Android-Google and Android-Samsung unless you're talking to an analyst or a geek. For most Android owners, they have an ""Android"" phone. What brand? Uhh I dunno Google? Android?<p>Android as a brand is the collection of not just the superstar devices, but the shitty POS devices as a whole.<p>So as a brand, iOS > Android because the average of Android is weighed down by the crappy side of Cheap Android.<p>That doesn't mean that any one device is superior to any other one device, but rather that as a collective brand, the iOS brand is superior to Androids, and if you blindly buy an iOS device you're more likely to get quality than if you blindly buy an Android device.",1342461767

136527,comment,136364,136364,0,0,pc,,,"His hypothetical continuations don't quite work.<p><pre><code>  theSite = mark();\n  puts ""Hello, World!""\n  theSite.return();\n</code></pre>\nThis is the first example in the post, and one which it's claimed will loop continually. Translating to Scheme (where we can actually run the pseudo-code):<p><pre><code>  (begin\n    (define theSite #f)\n    (set! theSite (call/cc (lambda (c) c)))\n    (print ""Hello, World!"") (newline)\n    (theSite #f))\n</code></pre>\nAnd we get:<p><pre><code>  > (begin\n      (define theSite #f)\n      (set! theSite (call/cc (lambda (c) c)))\n      (print ""Hello, World!"") (newline)\n      (theSite #f))\n  ""Hello, World!""\n  ""Hello, World!""\n  procedure application: expected procedure, given: #f; arguments were: #f\n</code></pre>\nThis translation to Scheme seems fair, since the definition of mark() explicitly states that it ""allows you to pass information back to the original site, so that it evaluates to a different value"" -- which means that the return value of mark() itself is clearly significant, and therefore that the step of ""set theSite to the result of evaluating the current form"" is considered part of the continuation (or ""mark"").<p>In this case, theSite gets set to #f, and the continuation is then ""broken"".<p>It might seem tedious to nitpick here, but continuations are so mysterious exactly because of these issues. mark() _can't be fixed_ without drastically changing the semantics of continuations. This is kinda non-obvious, and something that people often discover suddenly when wondering why call/cc is implemented in such a roundabout fashion.<p>Continuations are confusing to point where even toy examples in pedagogical blog posts are easy to mess up.",1205465735

136521,comment,136067,136328,0,0,maximilian,,,"Goto a cheaper grad. school - a state run one.  I'm going to san diego state and its waaaay cheaper than most schools and great for what i'm doing (applied math).  Professors are almost the same everywhere (some good, some bad) and grad students are into what they study independent of location.  If i was in-state, i'd pay only $4k/year in tuition, which is an order of magnitude cheaper than private schools.  You might incur a bit of debt while working towards a masters, but you'll learn a ton along the way and be very practical, which is what a masters is for anyway - apply all that theoretical knowledge to a real situation under the guidance of those who've do that all the time.",1205464508

He then goes on to talk about how this is not necessarily rational in terms of classical economics. (maximising value)<p>The funny thing about economics is that in the traditional macro economic models people are thought to be rational. This is obviously not true, as can seen in countless examples in everyday life.<p>In the case of why Y combinator has found a hole in the market he has the answer himself - an investor feels better explaining to his peers why a 35 year old MBA failed than explaining why a 25 year old pimple-faced hacker failed.<p>This is a part of behavioral economics, which tells us that markets are not rational at all - they are more based on psychology than rationality. This in turn gives a great advantage to people who have the guts and insight (or luck...) to see beyond it.<p>I bet that there are many more niches just waiting to be exploited.",1205464277

You&#x27;re not waiting for DNS to propagate to clients; if anything you&#x27;re waiting for recursive DNS servers at shitty ISPs to time out their caches when they are configured to not honor the RR&#x27;s TTL sent by the authoritative server in a misguided attempt to make the internet &quot;faster&quot;.<p>But this is completely avoidable without having to use IPs or certificates with CN/SAN that are IPs: get a wildcard cert and rotate the subdomain name. It&#x27;s a new hostname, so it busts intermediate DNS caches by being new queries; since it&#x27;s a new query, there&#x27;s no &quot;propagation to clients&quot; to wait for when you change IPs, all queries for the new name hit authoritative servers.  Additionally, it looks infinitely more legit than a website that is accessible only via IP address.  And doubly additionally, if you&#x27;re going through so many IPs, presumably you&#x27;ll be rotating some out and those may be assigned to other people who can then get their own cert for that IP and impersonate you.",1430470456

Don&#x27;t need to mess around with a staging server and uploading files + DB changes etc.<p>- All client projects are in their own environment with their own config / env vars / DB. So say a client wants changes made 3 months down the line it&#x27;s super easy to get the project back in the state it was then. On a local machine I frequently run into problems where I&#x27;ve updated my machine or changed config since last working with them and it takes an hour or two just to get the project going again.<p>- When learning new languages can just create a new project of that type and it has everything you need ready to go.

There are problems with it, which some people are quick to point out, and it is important to be aware of them.

They both, together with SSL, suffer from a bad case of design-by-committee, including atrocities like X509.<p>DNSSEC did get an important thing right. You are in full control of your own keys, and your DNS provider can not impersonate you.

401931,comment,401541,401629,0,0,jfornear,,,"Related only to this comment... I happen to be an Economics major as well. I'm graduating soon and am getting nervous about having to search for jobs/internships in this field because it seems most employers are looking for CS degrees. I have taken courses on Java and web programming in the CS department as electives, but most of what I know I've learned on my own. I don't really know much about theory.<p>Should I just be working on building my portfolio? I feel like the more I concentrate on my projects, the more my GPA suffers. I'm caught in a dilemma where I'm split between school and career aspirations, and that doesn't seem normal to me... or is it?<p>If I could do college over again, I would major in CS, but it's too late to change my major now. I had a horrible CS teacher in high school that initially scared me away from the subject.",1229587026
401930,comment,401022,401022,0,0,floodfx,,,"Take advantage of the object oriented features (classes, inheritence, etc)  Write unit tests early and often.  Re-read the docs; some of the PHP functions are inconsistently parameterized -- meaning one function expects params in one order and a simliar function expects the params in the opposite order!  (Can't think of those functions off the top of my head but there I swear...)  Just be careful.  PHP is forgiving (almost?) to a fault",1229586775

401928,comment,401788,401831,0,0,bokonist,,,"1)  Preventing a deflationary spiral is not that difficult.  Declare a tax holiday, and print money to fund government operations.  Keep printing until the price of land/gold/oil stabilize and start to rise again.  At that point, ease off and return to a stable money supply.<p>2)  Money supply deflation usually only lasts a couple years, four years at most.  When the banks stop failing, the money supply stabilizes.  Bernanke is hard wired to err on the side of inflation, rather than deflation. so I would not expect a deflation lasting more than a year or two.<p>3)  Price deflation can last for decades, but that's a sign of a stable money supply and a rising productivity ( for instance from 1980 to 2000 in the computer industry).  From 1870 to 1910 was a period of general deflation, but it was perhaps the best time for startups in the history of the world.<p>4)  The New Deal had a devastating effect on small businesses.  The NRA, AAA, OPA, and other alphabet agencies were insane.  Here is a small taste:  ""The NRA was discovering it could not enforce its rules. Black markets grew up.  Only the most violent police methods could procure enforcement.  In Sidney's Hillman's garment industry the code authority employed enforcement police.  They could enter a man's factory, send him out, line up his employees, subject to minute interrogation, take over his books on the instant.  Night work was forbidden.  Flying squadrons of these private coat-and-suit police went through district at night looking for men who were committing the crime of sewing together a pair of pants at night.  But without those harsh methods many code authorities said there could be no compliance because the public was not back of it."" source: <a href=""http://mises.org/books/rooseveltmyth.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/books/rooseveltmyth.pdf</a> (p 45)<p>Want to try a startup with the code authorities breaking down your door to stop you from coding at night?  And then there were was the crush of paper work, price regulations, etc:  ""A Michigan grocer who had run a successful business for 40 years testified that 'For the last six months I have been behind the counter ten hours a day, then up half the night filling out government forms. Sunday is needed for inventory reports, ration accounts or applications for coffee, sugar and canned goods. I couldn't keep up with it, so I closed my doors.' Small food distributors were going out of business by the tens of thousands a month."" (p. 316)",1229586735

That naturally makes it not a track friendly car. It will get passed up easily on the straightaways at some tracks (ex you can hit 140+ on the back straight at Road Atlanta). And the brakes will get roasted and it will run out of battery after just a few sessions.

In summary the Tesla is not a car guy's car, it's a SV show-off car.</i>",1229586139
401924,comment,400527,401040,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, it's not true. One group (bands, record labels, distributors, companies that press the cd, etc.) is getting hurt when you pirate a CD you otherwise would have paid for. However another group, often including the band you pirated, makes money when you pirate a CD you wouldn't have paid for, like it, and then go see a concert you otherwise might not.<p>In the end, the net effect is certainly bad for a lot of people, but possibly good for some.<p>Either way, it is unpreventable and isn't going away, so the question any more isn't so much ""who is this hurting and how much?"" as ""what do we do given the new realities of the industry?"" But just because the focus has changed doesn't mean that piracy isn't hurting people. It clearly is. Not as much as they'd like to claim (record industry lawsuits always assume every pirated CD would have been purchased, which is clearly far from true) but still, people are getting hurt.",1229586122

Which would actually make this a rare instance of volunteer work where your point doesn't apply in <i>any</i> case.<p>Even if they're also asking for hobbyists, your point still might not apply, because people take pleasure in their hobbies -- and it's possible that value(output of x hours of hobby work + pleasure gained from x hours of engaging in hobby) > value(output of x hours of maximally efficient work).",1229585672

I hope the Whitehouse doesn't do what big companies do to little startups so often. Hopefully the fact that they're not being taken in so much as taking over means it won't be so demotivating.

Some of the classical speeches from the early 20th century are really incredible. I wonder who really wrote them.<p>Obama's acceptance speech was very powerful, too. One of the most powerful speeches I have seen in a while. Comparatively, McCain's speeches seemed to lack a varying style.

401904,comment,401744,401883,0,0,jfarmer,,,"Yeah.  One of the advantages of Objective-C over C++, IMO, is that it's clear which syntax is foreign to C and which is the extension.

The problem is this: make a language that is a strict extension of C and has Smalltalk-style OO.<p>It's not a bad problem to solve and Objective-C does a nice job.  The syntax is odd, but it's to clearly separate the Objective-C parts from the C parts.<p>C++ on the other hand mushes the syntax together.

10521996,comment,10519487,10521446,0,0,rdtsc,,,"Sorry, you are right, it was too harsh. I am sorry.<p>I thought I was sharing my perspective on it, I didn&#x27;t think enough that it would hurt OP&#x27;s feelings. I made the comment lightheartedly even added an ;-) but it didn&#x27;t work obviously. Let me explain better then:<p>What I was trying to say is that I in large agree with how the market reacted to it. It is hard for Twitter to make money. There is a lot of HN armchair analyst advice around (which I engage in as well) such as &quot;why doesn&#x27;t Twitter just ... to make money&quot;. But presumably there are smart people working there and they probably thought of all those things.  It has been compared to Google or compared or Facebook. But those offer a richer more comprehensive experience. I give Google access to my life and it helps me drive places, keeps my email, and calender and other things.  I don&#x27;t use Facebook but my relatives do and they like. Twitter is too narrow in that respect. So objectively looking at it, I think it is struggling and it makes sense to me why.<p>And I pointed out that Twitter for me in the past has been associated more with negativity -- spats, mis-understandings stemming from reading short 140 character replies as being curt and rude, which then snowball and turn into fights.<p>Now what sounded most mean was saying some services would die. Sometimes, it is better to just have a service / product that is going down to just go down faster, to maybe something better take its place. There were languages, products, platforms, I enjoyed and liked but they just didn&#x27;t become popular. Hoping they would have an upswing sometimes is unrealistic. I wished and hope Thinkpads wouldn&#x27;t suck and IBM would come back and start making them and install Ubuntu on them, but it just won&#x27;t happen. It is better to just find something else. Anyway that is the sentiment where that comment came from.",1446843535

In terms of features, it&#x27;s around 4 times the scope of what we had. In terms of developer compatibility and ease-of-use, it&#x27;s about the same, but with a lot more tooling and experience. We&#x27;ve been able to double, if not triple, the capabilities we had on the older [Python] platform.&quot;<p>&quot;When customizing with Nuxeo-based apps, you don&#x27;t fork the UI to customize it, you contribute to it using plugins; it&#x27;s a very open and extensible model.&quot;<p>Having worked with the &quot;plugin&quot; model they built, I am at a loss as to how one would realistically accomplish the same thing effectively with either Python or node.js. The same things that make Python and JavaScript convenient for small scripts (duck typing, no checked exceptions, minimalist frameworks, lots of metaprogramming options) make it less convenient for platforms with the scale, scope, and customer requirements of Nuxeo and its competing products.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/nuxeo-zope-java-migration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/nuxeo-zope-java-migration</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/nuxeo_python_to_java"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/nuxeo_python_to_java</a>",1446843034

Once an Intel chip has decoded the instructions to uOps, it is mostly on an even playing-field with RISC chips.<p>This doesn&#x27;t actually answer my question at all, it&#x27;s just a canned response to something I alluded to in my question (CISC vs. RISC) and a debate which I don&#x27;t fully understand and would rather avoid. The question was <i>why does POWER consume so much power</i>, not <i>why doesn&#x27;t POWER being RISC matter</i>? The only reason I compared it to MIPS and ARM was that I thought it was similar to those architectures and they&#x27;re considered to be low-power.<p>The impetus is that POWER is actually <i>worse</i> than other architectures, <i>including</i> x86, for unexplained reasons, w.r.t. power consumption.",1446842961

They were out of the way, clearly marked as ads - and hence could be visually filtered out. They were pure text, so could be neatly included as elements on the rendered page. And they were always targeting an INTEREST. Not an individual.<p>So I would take that as the minimum acceptable advertising behaviour. Not implying that it&#x27;s perfect, but it&#x27;s a clear set of ground rules. With that in mind, _my_ ideal, non-intrusive ads mechanism builds on the following rules:<p>* Ads must never be inline to page content<p>* Even when clearly out of the way, ads must not be allowed to mimic page content; they must be clearly marked as ads<p>* Text only.<p><i></i>* I might accept an image within the ad, provided it was always served from the content provider&#x27;s system.<p>* As an extension to previous point: if the served image size would exceed a notable fraction of the page size, it must not be included in the output.<p>* No user tracking of any kind.<p>* No third-party javascript. Ever.<p>* At most 15% of display real estate allowed to be used by ads. Including the padding in the UI. (Counts as space denied from content.)<p>* Not allowed to affect page content load times. Ad material must be included at the end of the page code. If your service pushes ads from internal and separate system, hard timeouts must be imposed: if the internal system cannot serve an ad within an allotted time, the frontend must never be forced to wait. You just missed an ad impression. Tough.<p>* If clicking an ad takes a user through a bounce page, all identifiable information from the user must be stripped. Bounce page or redirect must not impose any further page loading delay.<p>* No beacons<p>Breaking even one of the rules automatically disqualifies you.<p>If you, as an advertiser, find these rules unacceptable - well, then we are in mutual disagreement. I find your ads equally unacceptable and treat them as a form of cancer.<p>However, as a genuine service to the user... please allow the user to search for ads that have been displayed to them. Preferably by display context. I would be glad to return to a subject at a later date and search for something I remember seeing earlier.<p>The above is still not ideal, but everything that behaved according to it would at least be palatable.",1446842937

I&#x27;m as big a fan of freedom as the next person, but it seems to me that the primary purpose of anonymous money is to do an end-run around the law.<p>To be perfectly honest, that&#x27;s exactly the reason I think anonymous money is a good idea. In a world where laws for huge nations are made by corporations, overthrow of government is impossible, and change within the system is too slow to solve problems now, breaking the law and getting away with it is one of the few remaining recourses an individual wishing to exercise their freedoms has.<p>The kinds of crimes this enables are exactly the kinds of crimes I don&#x27;t think should be crimes: drug use, prostitution.<p>Yes, it also enables tax evasion. However, I would argue that it&#x27;s merely leveling the playing field in this respect: the ultra-rich already have <i>legal</i> means of avoiding taxes which aren&#x27;t available to most people. Anonymous currency just makes it possible for average-to-poor people to avoid taxes. And ultimate, I&#x27;m not entirely against tax evasion: I like my roads, schools and libraries, but the US has spends more on the military than the next 7 top spenders combined to kill people for economic reasons, and I don&#x27;t have any way of preventing my tax money from going to that.<p>The kinds of crimes I <i>do</i> care about leave behind lots more evidence besides a money trail: murder leaves behind bodies, rape leaves behind witnesses (victims). Typically money trails have little to do with investigations on these kinds of things.<p>In the end, though, I don&#x27;t think talking about the upsides and downsides of anonymous money makes any difference. Bitcoin isn&#x27;t really anonymous, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time before easily anonymous money exists, and there&#x27;s really nothing that can be done to stop that.",1446842913

That means changing the diameter (and possibly depth) of the holes they go into.\nIn any reasonable parametric CAD software model (as Fusion 360 enourages), this is merely finding the sub-part that represents the peg or peghole, and entering in a new value for the diameter - every affected area of the model will be updated, correct & still manifold (watertight).\nWith an .STL you will need to find & select all the relevant edges/vertices for each hole, and nudge them around until they (hopefully) fit.\nThis is a trivial example, it becomes more interesting (more painful) if the feature at hand is more complex.

Perhaps this industry can&#x27;t actually survive with current technology and design methods absent some sort of government backstop or subsidy. Not sure. But the supply-side theory of this business seems like the most compelling (if not wholly complete) theory I&#x27;ve heard.<p>It sounds like you were never in enigneering. You never had to deal with building reliable system in regards of safety and high availability. And you even don&#x27;t know what is really happening in that industry.<p>Just a small example Rollce Royce revolutionized that business years before IT invented the Cloud and XaaS (X as a service). RR is proving flying as a service since years. As an airline, you don&#x27;t buy an airplane with engines. You as an airline decide and tell either Airbus or Boing what engines you like. Then RR (and others these days) don&#x27;t sell you the engine. They sell you flight time. So RR is reponsible that the engines runs without downtimes. RR provide service staff at all major and many minor airports to be able to provide service. RR inventend the Internet of Things way before IT came even close to those ideas. Because to be able to sell airtime, RR needs to know about the status and diagnostics of those engines. Competitors to RR are doing the same since years.<p>Then, a modern aircraft is stuffed with electronics to replace mechanics, like your car. Because mechanics are wheigt. With electronics this weight can be reduced. It also allowed &quot;services&quot; like autonomous flying. Different to the car industry, almost any modern airplane from Airbus and Boing is able to completely fly on its own inclusive take-off and landing. Only taxiing is not possible.<p>But electronics have to problem of requiring redundancy to build highly available systems and all that with limited ressources. All way before IT has their 99.999 SAL and with much higher rates. We talk in these industries with undetected errors with a probability of 10^-15 and less.",1446842230

However, I don&#x27;t really see it as much of a <i>choice</i> between quality and price.<p>Why? Because I don&#x27;t feel like I have any information about the quality of the service or level of comfort before the flight. A lot of the cheaper and mid-range budget airlines are pretty much like-for-like in terms of experience, reviews are always skewed towards the negative and therefore don&#x27;t contain too much useful information (people very rarely go online to write a good review after a comfortable flight with a cheap airline, but they absolutely do go online to complain and vent when it&#x27;s uncomfortable) and anyway I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth the time and effort to dig through reviews and try to find out what exactly my experience will be like on one 3 hour budget flight vs another, considering the amounts involved are not massive. Obviously I do go off my own experience, but even this varies from flight to flight with the same airline.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of noise, therefore usually the easiest way to feel like you&#x27;re getting the best value is simply to spend the lowest amount possible, assuming the experience will not be different enough to make you wish you&#x27;d spent more. To be honest, I think this is a decent strategy. It&#x27;s very rare I&#x27;ve taken a flight and wished I&#x27;d spent $20 more on another airline to get a better cheese and crackers and coffee or a slightly more comfortable seat.

Yes, a URLString would be redundant.  In C#, the URI data type <i>contains</i> a Utf16 string as a data member but it is <i>not another type of string</i>.<p>We were talking about different things.<p>The ASCII/Unicode string data types would be somewhat analogous to int32/int64/float32/float64/Money data types.<p>The way C# does it is that everything is Utf16 and there is no separate ASCIIString data type for pure ASCII strings.  They also don&#x27;t have pure Utf8 strings.   Instead, the UTF16 classes has member &quot;get()/encode()&quot; functions that interpret as ASCII or UTF8.  The ASCII/Utf8 data state is transitory.  This architectural choice is fine for most apps but if you have 1 gigabyte of ASCII data, it&#x27;s very memory inefficient to double the memory footprint to 2 GB for Utf16 just to slice & dice strings.  If you use byte[] arrays to keep everything as raw ASCII to conserve memory, you don&#x27;t get any convenient string-like slice & dice functions.  The &quot;string type&quot; is lost in a opaque byte[] array.",1446841766

The event was really well organized and filled up to the stocks with all kinds of stuff. We were lucky that we (www.jack.chat) had our AT stand on day one because everything is new to everyone, and everybody is excited and curious. We had nonstop traffic at our 40“ wide stand and everybody was really nice and excited for us. It was just an awesome experience! A few investors showed up as well, asked interesting questions, and took notes. Our booth neighbors - Mommy Dearest - were really cool, too, and we hung out after the events and shared insights and experiences.<p>I attended 3 talks. 2 on main stage and 1 at the code summit. The main stage talks were watched by thousands of people and honestly were just plain boring. The stage was very impressive but the speakers weren’t. The code summit talk by Jon Hodgson on the other hand was really good.\nThe Night Summit was kind of disappointing because all people went to this one place and it was just heavily overcrowded.

But ...<p>> It hardly takes a leap to look at the abysmal performance of planes built by Ford and suspect that management there was particularly … lackadaisical in their pursuit of quality.<p>Things like that alarm me; it&#x27;s a proven method for condemning the innocent and unpopular. We can form hypothetical links between many events - Billy is a mean person and disliked Joe, Joe&#x27;s been murdered, so hang Billy; or, every morning the rooster crows and then the sun rises, therfore the rooster is doing it - but most will be false. We need evidence to differentiate truth from imagination.<p>From the Amazon page, Publisher&#x27;s Weekly seems to think less of the book (though Kirkus likes it):<p><i>Although Wallace (Who Killed Kurt Cobain?) is a recipient of Rolling Stone&#x27;s Award for Investigative Journalism and appears to have done much primary research, he delivers a highly speculative rehash of material handled much better in A. Scott Berg&#x27;s Lindbergh, Robert Lacey&#x27;s Ford: The Man and the Machine and such seminal studies as Charles Higham&#x27;s American Swastika. Wallace tries and fails to sensationalize well-known facts about the parochial American fifth column of the late 1930s and early &#x27;40s, a bungling movement of which Ford and Lindbergh were among the most public faces. Wallace sees a conspiracy in what he presents as Ford&#x27;s pro-Nazi partnership with Lindbergh: a dark and powerful alliance designed to hinder the Allies at every turn. In fact, the two men were far more naive than effectual in their attempts to prop up American isolationism before Pearl Harbor. And Lindbergh, who counted Harry Guggenheim among his closest friends, found Ford&#x27;s hatred of Jews repugnant. Once war was declared, both Lindbergh and Ford helped the Allied effort. Lindbergh helped develop the Corsair and later, as a &quot;civilian observer,&quot; flew more than 25 combat missions over the South Pacific. At the same time, Ford (with Lindbergh&#x27;s help, and after a few false starts) became the leading manufacturer of the B-24 bomber. Were Ford and Lindbergh half-witted dupes of Nazi propaganda before the war? Undoubtedly. Were they Nazi agents either before or after the start of hostilities? Wallace fails to make the case.</i>",1446841329

Two waves of any frequencies will only interact additively in linear media -- so no low frequencies are created through their interaction (unless non-linear effects come into play, but those usually create higher, not lower, order harmonics afaik). Beating is merely an interpretation of a modulating wave, the reality is the Fourier spectrum.<p>Second, as far as I know our hearing is composed of linear excitation elements (they have a definite bandwidth), and this is confirmed pretty well by experiments with human hearing -- you can see the threshold of our hearing at about 20kHz and that we experience tones of different frequencies fairly independently. Those assumptions imply that two tones, one at e.g. 50kHz and another at 50.001kHz are inaudible, end of story.<p>You can actually do this experiment yourself if you have a signal generator that can do 1Hz amplitude modulation and drive a transducer with a non-negligible sensitivity in that range.",1446840745

We moved away from Mongo for very similar reasons, but we moved to Cassandra instead of Postgres only with great trepidation (we were worried about scalability issues).<p>Only time will tell if this was a good move or if we should have just done as you did.  Good luck out there!",1446840086

Many new products and platforms have been created to help sales organizations with these changes but sales reps and sales managers lack a compelling, easy to use, interface to organize, visualize, and share data about their prospects and sales performance.<p>Solution:  We are building a sales platform that automatically interfaces and integrates with all backend sales systems and tools (CRM, Email, Calendar, Social, etc).  Our initial product radically simplifies how sales reps organize and interact with the prospect/buyers  It’s an elegantly-designed product adapted to let them efficiently sell to their prospects without the headaches of CRM entry or spreadsheets.<p>We’re an Atlanta startup looking for passionate hackers that love building amazing, technically-difficult products that make huge impact on people’s lives.  We’re a small team with a strong background: a wildly successful serial entrepreneur that can’t stop and a passionate ex-Googler that lives on the forefront of tech.<p>You:<p>- Love the full stack.  It’s OK if you don’t have chops in every technology that we’re using, but you should genuinely be eager about learning. Here’s what comprises our stack:  AngularJS, Meteor/Node.js, Javascript, Sass, Go (aka Golang), IPython (data science).<p>- Look forward to building and owning huge parts of the product.  You’ll be one of the first technical hires and there are a lot of exciting pieces to work on, lets chat and we can find the right fit for you.<p>- Love to get going -- have the mentality of a hacker and the quality of a pro.<p>- Yearn for the high rewards of an early stage startup.  Lucky for you, not so much risk as we have a great comp plan lined up for you.<p>- Want to influence and grow the culture of a young company.  The way we see it: We’re building something of immense value, let’s have fun doing it.<p>- Live in Atlanta, or can make the move.<p>- Are full-time, part-time or looking for an internship.  If you’re a rockstar, we don’t care what your deal is, let’s get you on board!",1409867848

By the time you factor in preferred shares and other investment dilution, your 0.1% will be more like 0.00001%[+].  Few people think about that, and unless someone is actively looking out for your interests (e.g. someone giving retention grants -- or you demanding them), it&#x27;s difficult to make a lot of money as an early startup employee. You can easily find yourself in a situation where you vest your grant, leave the company, and later find out that a new hire is making an order of magnitude more money than you in an exit.  That&#x27;s startup life.<p>The game here is predicting the expected value of an extremely improbable future event, and sacrificing <i>present day</i> money in favor of that event. There&#x27;s no &quot;fair&quot; way to do it, so if a founder is asking that kind of commitment of you, they should be looking out for your interests over the long term as well.<p>[+] edit: I overstated my case here.

I&#x27;ve got a blog, a couple of image galleries, and a couple of graphic novels. I&#x27;m using styles I designed myself for all of these, plus about a dozen plugins.<p>I didn&#x27;t have to dig into its guts to make this stuff work. I didn&#x27;t have to type a single terminal command to make it happen. I just had to upload some files via FTP, then leverage HTML/CSS and some basic PHP knowledge. And now I just type stuff into a web form, or fire up a client app on my computer (or my phone/tablet), and post whatever the hell I want to with very little friction. Those posts get mirrored to Facebook, Livejournal, Twitter, and Tumblr automatically. Comic pages get automagically collected into [chapters](<a href=""http://egypt.urnash.com/rita/chapter/01/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://egypt.urnash.com/rita/chapter/01/</a>).

It requires Node. How many web hosts have Node preinstalled? Do I really have time in my busy schedule of drawing comics to install Node, get it running, and keep it up to date? My host keeps PHP up to date for me and I can get on with making the content, rather than fiddling with the blog.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to dig deep into WP. Version 1 is ten years old. There&#x27;s probably some horrible code from 1.0 still lying around that codebase - hell, there&#x27;s probably some code left over from 2001&#x27;s B2, which WP forked off of. But I don&#x27;t want to dig into its code <i>anyway</i>. I just want to have a website that I don&#x27;t have to edit by hand.<p>From the perspective of someone using WP to manage their content, rather than as a project in and of itself, working with it is <i>pretty easy</i>.",1409867747

The FreeBSD base system is developed intact, so there are far fewer kernel/library versioning issues.<p>2. FreeBSD, possibly because of its academic heritage, tends to take a more careful &quot;let&#x27;s study this problem and make sure we come up with the right solution&quot; approach.  This means that FreeBSD development is often slower, but once a feature is added it is more likely to actually work.  (This is somewhat self-reinforcing: FreeBSD&#x27;s stability attracts companies building servers and appliances, and when those companies contribute back they care a lot about having things continue to not break.)<p>3.

For instance, if I start using Skype, I may want to place calls from Skype using my cell phone number.

Instead of revealing the mistake by disconnecting or playing an error message, engineers decided the least obtrusive way to handle these glitches was to allow the system to go ahead and patch the call through to the wrong number. Adar says most people just assumed the error was theirs, hung up, and redialed. “The illusion of an infallible phone system was preserved,” he writes in the paper.</i><p>Then later:<p>> <i>One relatively benign class of examples occurs when an operating system fails in some way and a piece of software is programmed to cover up the glitch. The misdials of the early phone switching system fall into this category.</i><p>Really, that depends how you&#x27;re covering it up.  The case of the telephone network is clearly <i>malicious</i>.  It didn&#x27;t do much harm, but it <i>was</i> harmful, and the benefit was all for the owner of the phone network:  they basically caused more mis-dials than was necessary, wasting people&#x27;s time in the process… then they tell the users it&#x27;s their fault!  (The lie was by omission, but no less efficient.)<p>Even in cases where short-terms benefits are clear, like placebo buttons or progress bars, I fear the lack of trust that it could pose long term.  People already see their computers as independent thinking agents.  Some of them are <i>afraid</i> of their computer, but use it anyway because they&#x27;ve become so dependent.  Deceitful interfaces will likely reinforce this learned helplessness.<p>This kind of insidious, diffuse damage may be far worse than any observable benefits.

One way to prevent this is to route it to a pin.<p>If logic is fed by a constant, it will be optimized out right up to the point where the result of the logic is mixed with some external input.  (early tools could not use the dedicated reset net due to this- reset for each flip-flop had to be routed to a pin or the reset net was optimized out which means the initial state of your flip-flop is lost).<p>If you have identical logic, one copy is optimized out due to aggressive CSE.  This is often bad for performance (routing in an FPGA is as slow as logic, so it&#x27;s better to regenerate identical results in multiple places), so you add &quot;syn_maxfan&quot; constraints to prevent the &quot;optimization&quot;.<p>On the other hand, an input flip flop will be duplicated if the fanout limit is exceeded- but this prevents the use of the dedicated I/O cell flip flop which then causes external timing to be messed up.

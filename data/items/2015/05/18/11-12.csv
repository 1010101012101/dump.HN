9563867,comment,9563582,9563582,0,0,AaronFriel,,,"We need to be very careful with this. And I mean we, the hacker community, we, society at large, and we, people who genuinely want to reach those with communication disadvantages.<p>I&#x27;ll start with why: this may not be Philip writing to us. I would like to believe it is, and those of us who may be on the autistic spectrum will not find it difficult to believe that this writing is of the ability they had when they were his age. That confirmation bias is but one of a number of cognitive biases that impel us to find Philip in these words. We are, of course, social creatures, and generally when we read heartfelt things like this we will set aside our critical nature. When presented with new and plausible information in the absence of anything that might indicate contrarily, we err to assume that it is true.<p>But it likely is not. This blog highlights the &quot;Rapid Prompting Method&quot;. This method is not strongly supported in blind tests. There is little empirical evidence that it allows persons with nonverbal autism to communicate, and in fact, decades of failed trials that suggest that this and other methods of facilitated communication do not work. It tugs at the heart strings, and it pains me to say this, but it is sadly almost certainly not Philip expressing these thoughts.<p>What is rapid prompting? It is a process of rapidly presenting someone with options until they have produced sensible text. In practice, it looks like someone guiding a person who is stimming as a human Ouija board[1]. The practitioner silently omits incorrect options, just as superstitious teens neglect digrams that don&#x27;t make sense when they are found with a Ouija board.<p>This may be more than that, I would very much hope so. But the American Psychological Association&#x27;s position on all forms of facilitated communication is firm: they are fraudulent[2]. Comparing rapid prompting to facilitated communication has already been done, as has been written about in NIH-supported journals[3]. These and other methods are woo, as the skeptical community describes it: not science. This woo is perpetrated by unwitting charlatans[4].<p>That harsh language is necessary, because we are doing something, I think, much worse than merely mistakenly giving a voice to persons with nonverbal autism. Instead, there are loving, adoring parents and &quot;rapid prompting&quot; experts who are unwittingly casting their voice as another&#x27;s. Instead of undoing the silence of autism, they are turning people into dummies with a textual form of ventriloquism.<p>What the hacker community should take from this is this: the desire to help those persons who have nonverbal autism is going to be very strong, but you can do great harm by making something that doesn&#x27;t work. But if you&#x27;re hacking something together, if you think you have a way to help, be cautious. Don&#x27;t give in to the desire to &quot;disrupt&quot; this space. Instead, work with the psychological community, work with those who study neurological development. Don&#x27;t just make something parents and loved ones want, make something <i>that works</i>.<p>What society should take from this is that when people have their ability to communicate taken from them, it is very easy to put another&#x27;s voice in their place and have everyone be none the wiser. It is very sad, but that is what happens to many of those &quot;assisted&quot; with facilitated communication. And as always, be skeptical of cures and success stories. It&#x27;s easy to be swept away by what we want to be true.<p>And finally, there are people who want to help those with communication disadvantages of all kinds. For those people working on this right now: Take that desire to make something that works, and rigorously apply the skepticism the public should have - but doesn&#x27;t - to what you&#x27;re doing. That is vital, it is key, it is the most important thing you can do. Don&#x27;t allow wishful thinking to turn a child with autism into a puppet.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp3G8yM2vTg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp3G8yM2vTg</a> - One of many, many similar videos you can find.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24102487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24102487</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.science20.com/countering_tackling_woo/blog/why_rapid_prompting_method_still_doesn%E2%80%99t_pass_evidencebased_test-68146"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.science20.com/countering_tackling_woo/blog/why_ra...</a>",1431950070

9563764,comment,9563148,9563148,0,0,baldfat,,,"TL:DR - Sounds like it is a fearful place to work and puts all ownership on the employee and nothing on the person doing the fire with no checks or balances. Just a clear cut you disappoint me and I will fire you quickly and even pay you off instead of you suing me.<p>Having had to fire people this read like a lead balloon. I have fired several people and the hardest one was the first time, but after it was over it felt good for everyone in the business.<p>This is really managing by fear. The manager might say &quot;It won&#x27;t be a surprise for you or me implies that this is a non-verbal understanding. Well a lot of people get paranoid when it comes to job security and might have had a bad experience so anything and everything means they are on the verge of losing their job. If I was a worker on his team I would shutter any time I saw my boss walk into my office and say may I sit down. Seems very much a scare tactic. My company when we fire someone there has been several steps taken and it is dignified. (Unless you did something illegal or unethical, than it is quick and clean with an escort out the building.) You go through a written warning. You than have a performance progresses plan written by the employee and the manager together. You may have the manager sit in your work space for a few times to make sure that the person understands their roles in action and make sure that it just isn&#x27;t a lack of knowledge or training. If it is our business culture we will get a co-worker to partner up with the person to help them find their place (Or see that it might not be for them and that is okay for both parties).<p>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a check and balance between his decision to fire and the action. As a manager I just didn&#x27;t see the person&#x27;s positive side since they had a trait I couldn&#x27;t stand (perception of them being lazy or a bully to their co-workers) and I almost fired people which months and years later proved I was wrong in assuming they deserved to be fired. This also saves the work place from being a homogeneous Big Boys Club.<p>PERSONAL Opinion : Professionals (I am assuming this is a professional position and not some low hourly wage job) normally don&#x27;t get fired for them not being smart enough or the ability to improve. I find that it normally is the fault of the employer for why the relationship didn&#x27;t work out due to a manger or even the negative culture of the company.",1431948058

It turned out that even at a very high price for the domain it did not have to increase sales by a lot (single digit) in order to pay itself off over just a few years.<p>We launched Ring.com in October and so far it appears that the benefits are happening however it will never be something that we can 100% be sure of.<p>I am actually not a big fan of domains anymore but I think a extremely marquee one like Ring.com was worth stretching the budget for.",1431947025

Did the acquisition price:<p>(a) Return the investors money?\n(b) Compensate the founders for the opportunity cost of their time?<p>If so, then the acquiring company valued the startup as being worth more than the resources that went into it, so the startup created value.<p>With most acquihires, I think the answer to both (a) and (b) is &quot;no&quot;, so it&#x27;s not fair to call the startup a success.<p>There are other considerations - the value the startup created for customers, the enjoyment of the founders, the treatment of the startup employees, and so forth.

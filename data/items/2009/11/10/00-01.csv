Common sense says that the performance difference in these cases will be immaterial anyway barring some bizarre scenario, so you should write whatever is clearer.<p>If you try 1000 iterations, StringBuilder will be clearly on top, and if you try 100,000 iterations, there will be no contest.<p>Also, the methodology in this test is completely broken.  I wouldn't be surprised if the compiler partially or completely optimizes out the loops using immutable strings, since you don't use the result anywhere.  To design a correct test for a micro-optimization like this you need to check the generated code in each instance (at a minimum.)<p>EDIT:  I just noticed the strbldr.ToString() as well, which completely defeats the purpose even further.

In Django-speak a view is a function that takes optional arguments, processes data on the model, and (typically) outsets key/value pairs of object. They key/value pairs get fed into the template.  E.g. if you did had a  URL /sales/by_country, then a view would be executed that would do a query that returned the sales by country in a pure python data-type (e.g. a list). All the presentation code, would be be done in a template.<p>In MVC, you have controllers that were the 'business logic' and views that were the 'presentation code'.<p>MVC is arguably more pure from a design perspective, MTV arguably fits more naturally with the way the web works.<p>This 'snakes and rubies' video starring DHH and the Django team is a good session that explores it in more detail.

That is why it has always been the king of currencies.<p>2) There are vastly more practical uses for gold today than there have ever been in the past 6000 years.

The word 'choice' conveys very different meanings: everything we do is a choice, but many of our actions are highly constrained. After decades of nuclear power development, no one earth has successfully run a nuclear power system without massive government funding or control. That suggests that we don't know how to do such a thing.<p><i>The ""massive investment"" for nuclear power is well within the capabilities of many US companies.</i><p>Not in anything that looks like a free market. Right now, the federal government provides very large subsidies to nuclear power operators. As a result, we've had...no new nuclear power plants built in the last three decades. In the absence of the massive government subsidies we have in place now, I don't believe there are any utilities that could afford to build a nuclear plant on their own or secure the necessary financing.<p><i>Note that at least some of the ""expense"" is also a choice.</i><p>And yet nuclear power is very expensive all over the world. Nuclear power plants are almost always over budget and late no matter where they're built. When different people all over the world keep making the same mistakes, at some point, you have to consider the possibility that all these mistakes are not just random individual failures but reflect intrinsic properties of current reactor technology.<p><i>We spend a lot of money on nukes that has nothing to do with safety or power production.</i><p>I don't know what you're referring to here.",1274122308

1355042,comment,1354744,1354744,0,0,rlpb,,,"When working from a single office, I have in the past defined a shared area as a nominated ""binary repository"".<p>The rules for the binary repository are that everything is versioned by filename and so a given file never changes - if you need to change a file you copy it and give it a new filename. Then you don't need locks. The versioned build script in the git repository finds the binary repository from an environment variable. This way old revisions in the git repository that depend on old binaries still work, but there is full visibility to delete old versions in the binary repository to free up space as required.<p>I used this kind of arrangement for things like upstream tarballs which changed relatively infrequently. I'm not sure how well this would work for you though.<p>One thing I think you might want is the ability to rebuild any revision out of your repository. Any revision control system achieves this, but if your build depends on binaries that aren't ""in"" the git repo, then how would this work?<p>If you still want some way of locking binaries, then there is an immediate question: how and when are files locked and unlocked? Manually (like SourceSafe)? Automatically on file open?<p>I would reconsider whether you want the binaries in the source tree or just running parallel alongside it. If they're not managed by git, then being in the source tree would cause confusion, wouldn't it?<p>For manually locked binaries, you might find a suitable WebDAV server useful, perhaps? The protocol supports locks. Maybe something built on git hooks and WebDAV with a central binary repository will work for you.<p>For automatically locked binaries available and modifiable across multiple offices, take a look at Synctus (my product). I'm not clear if this would be useful to you though.",1274119978

Currently it is booked as capital gains, although the fund manager may not have invested any capital. You can find out if a fund manager is invested in their own fund by reading the 'Statement of Additional Information' (SAI) on their website/prospectus.<p><i>Investors</i> in a VC fund would continue to be taxed under capital gains provisions, as they are now. Also, a fund manager's own capital investment in a fund would be continue to be taxed as capital gains; only the amount paid as a performance bonus for success in managing <i>other</i> people's money would be taxed as income.

I entered MIT100K, Princeton, One run by the state of RI, and one by OATV, O'Reilly's venture arm. What I ""Won"":<p>- Met Tim O'Reilly/Went to FOO Camp: Part of winning the OATV competition was going to SF, Foo Camp - an amazing networking/educational event.<p>- $25K in cash and services. Not a huge amount, but enough to be meaningful.<p>- Connections: The judges of these things tend to be successful business people. They opened doors for me and passed on great info.<p>- Experience: Pitched 10+ top tier VC firms, and learned how to create demand. Getting VC's competitive juices flowing was a great experience. You also get to talk to a lot of folks with training wheels, your ignorance doesn't seem out of place.<p>- Knowledge: Thinking about markets: YC really seems to push product, but it is important to think through market opportunities. These semi-academic exercises force you to research the markets to a granular and overcome common criticism.<p>- Knowledge: Most people who are starting companies haven't had a ton of exposure to legal issues. These competitions tend to be heavily sponsored by local law firms who are happy to share info.<p>- Experience: Pick your team carefully. It is a lesson PG espouses, but is really impactful when you learn it first hand with founder fallout. Luckily I learned this before quitting my job.<p>Is this as valuable as doing YC? I don't imagine so, but if you are in school anyway doing one of these competitions is a ton better than some useless elective.",1274119895

In fact, several, if not the most of, classic OT papers were later found to be inconsistent, e.g. some combination of concurrent edits makes copies diverge (source: P. Molli). And that problems are extremely hard to find/understand.\nApparently, the original authors of OT had a local network in mind: universal connectivity, instant message propagation, etc. But the internet is full of ""relativistic"" effects: different clients have different views of the state, messages propagate with finite/varying speed, etc etc.\nAfter reading the article, try to estimate what happens if e.g. one client syncs hourly/daily/monthly (like in the git), or suppose we don't have a central server (like in git), or if the stream of edits is too dense... like we really have a hundred of monkeys...\nMaybe Google engineers managed to get the probability of OT screw-ups lower than the probability of all other screw-ups... but that does not make the theory any better.<p>(...and the way they dealt with XML is a very special song. OT is pretty much a complexity explosion itself, but they also multiplied it by the complexity of XML; got 15 kinds of mutation operations and all the stuff.

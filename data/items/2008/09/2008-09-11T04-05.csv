301116,comment,301030,301030,0,0,hooande,,,"TechCrunch50 isn't really a competition, it's a series of product demos. This is kind of like presenting the philosophies of different religions and then voting on which one is the ""best"". The whole thing is subjective and there is absolutely no need to declare a winner, especially when the market will ultimately decide. This is exactly why YCombinator doesn't have investors vote on which company ""won"" Demo Day. I pity our american idol society that always wants a panel of judges to tell them what to like.<p>As for Yammer itself, I'm thoroughly unimpressed. At the least they could have made it <i>look</i> different than twitter. They even copied the UI. There were so many companies doing truly innovative things... TechCrunch50 seems like a total farce.",1221107962
301115,comment,300920,300920,0,0,iigs,,,"I started hunt and peck typing at 5 (Apple //c represent!), and had evolved to a four finger lazy-look typing method by 7th grade typing class. I didn't start actually typing without looking at the keyboard until I purchased a factory defect keyboard from a computer fair when I was in 9th grade. This keyboard had no lettering ink on any of the keys. I remember my mom being in disbelief that I could look at her and type something else quickly at the same time.<p>Best $10 I ever spent.<p>Because I learned to type this way I have rather unconventional / poor form. My hands rarely center properly on the home row, I tend to use my middle fingers for the upper inside letters, and I don't always use the same fingers for the same keys (I type the first ""e"" in ""letters"" with my middle finger and the second with the proper finger).<p>One other positive side effect of that keyboard while I was exploring UNIX was that there was no value in looking at punctuation either, so I learned to touch type all punctuation, not just the secretary subset, at the same time.",1221107960

Or do people forget the constant complaints here after the original apps launched?<p>I don't get it, but people like attacking Facebook, solely because it does what it does superbly.

The parser doesn't care if all the functions have names like doTheNextThing() or french_onion_soup, but it would be a slap in the face to any future maintainers.<p>Choosing informative names and separating a program along clear conceptual boundaries can be a greater aid to understanding than any syntactic redundancies. Well-placed comments help smooth things over, particularly notes on why a particular approach was chosen. The names themselves should be able to convey what is going on in most cases.<p>(For distilled wisdom along those lines, see _Thinking Forth_ by Leo Brodie, also online at <a href=""http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/</a>.)",1221107419

I learned to type exactly the same way, not quite proper, but at 80-100 wpm.<p>I switched to the Dvorak keyboard layout about two years ago. Same speed, but it feels better -- much more time on the home row, for one thing. I think it's worth trying if you're interested, but it's your life. ABCD (<a href=""http://www.gigliwood.com/abcd/abcd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigliwood.com/abcd/abcd.html</a>) was helpful (and funny). Just dive in, give it a month or so of normal typing. The first few days will be disorienting -- very old habits are being disrupted. (Also, you can switch back and forth once you're accustomed to it, but doing so initially will probably make learning much harder.)<p>It works quite well with Emacs, but hjkl navigation in vi becomes a bit awkward.

Failover is nearly as easy as in MongoDB, however all this doesn&#x27;t play so nicely yet, if you are using stuff like extensions (PostGIS), your own functions and still isn&#x27;t really an out-of-the box experience.<p>I agree, if you use it with the same limits and the performance gain is worth it, you can as well be using Postgres. However, a lot of this actually only changed in the recent releases. It&#x27;s all still fairly new.<p>Also there are still a number of things that are basically missing, like out of the box upserts (we are using a function for this, but it more a hack) and if you are still somewhat in development a lot of little changes get really hard in PostgreSQL. Converting your data structure, even with stuff like CTE and surrounding functionality can become really challenging, especially when you think there must be an easier way.<p>Where it is easier to modify structures in MongoDB it is actually harder to aggregate it sometimes. Using stuff like Map Reduce (even the lightweight version called aggregate) frequently appears sort of an overkill.<p>I think however it really depends on the kind of data you are dealing with. That&#x27;s why we are using a hybrid system right now. Both systems are actually evolving really quickly and if you have the joy of using their most recent versions one is always excited about new releases.",1383839977

The operations for which MongoDB is optimised are inserting documents, retrieving document by ID, and conducting map-reduces across the whole database. Yes, it has the ability to query by values in leaves, and it can use indices to make that faster, but that&#x27;s a bit of a second-tier, bag-on-the-side feature, isn&#x27;t it?

On the other end, I also work on startup projects on the week-ends, with people in different countries and I don&#x27;t feel the same miscommunication problems in this context.<p>It is possible that remote working in an academic context is indeed possible, but that the highly technical type of communication required to make it work effectively is beyond my current skill.

I&#x27;ve seen many people install a new version of windows and marvel at its amazing boot time. Then they actually install antivirus, etc and a few months go by... And the measurable fact is that soon it takes as long to boot as their old computer.<p>You, unlike most people who maintain windows machines, probably know what you&#x27;re doing.

That&#x27;s not to say that they&#x27;re fictitious but rather that they reflect a certain viewpoint and methodology which is only relevant for a few customers. I&#x27;ve found Akamai&#x27;s numbers to track very closely with what I measure:<p><a href=""http://www.akamai.com/html/io/io_dataset.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.akamai.com/html/io/io_dataset.html</a><p>They don&#x27;t publish technical details about their methodology but I suspect you&#x27;re seeing a sampling bias: NetMarketShare is used by a modest number of large companies, almost exclusively North American and mostly related to media, and their stats appear to depend on an embedded JavaScript tracker:<p><a href=""http://netmarketshare.com/faq.aspx#Methodology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netmarketshare.com/faq.aspx#Methodology</a><p>There are some apparent technical botches: they didn&#x27;t appear to use a CDN at all  when I last traced counter.hitslink.com in the spring everything went to Los Angeles and was correspondingly slower globally but it now[1] appears that they might be using CloudFront  or set Cache-Control headers, so if you&#x27;re outside North America or on a slow connection you were going to see a higher rate of their JS failing to load and for the tracker ping back not to load by the time the user navigates to a new page:<p><a href=""http://redbot.org/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcounter.hitslink.com%2Ftrack.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redbot.org/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcounter.hitslink.com%2Ft...</a><p>(In contrast, the Akamai numbers reflect direct HTTP traffic for sites like microsoft.com, iTunes, etc. so they avoid the issues related to JS trackers but do require care to filter robots which spoof a browser UA)<p>They also listed some major sites like CNN or Mozilla which didn&#x27;t use that JS bug so they either have an unadvertised bulk log delivery service or are portraying smaller side sites as representative of the massive high-traffic main sites.<p>The real question is the way they interpret the data, and in particular the weighting scheme. Because everyone knows Internet Explorer is common in China, they weight the numbers to represent this but you&#x27;re simply hoping their usage of the CIA Internet Traffic by Country report is accurate:<p><a href=""http://www.netmarketshare.com/faq.aspx#Country"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netmarketshare.com/faq.aspx#Country</a><p>The numbers I can measure are very close to Akamai, showing Chrome tied with IE even in China:<p><a href=""http://www.akamai.com/html/io/io_dataset_v2.html#stat=browser&top=5&type=pie&start=20131006&end=20131105&geocode=47"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.akamai.com/html/io/io_dataset_v2.html#stat=browse...</a><p>1. <a href=""http://www.webpagetest.org/result/131107_2C_PZK/1/details/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webpagetest.org/result/131107_2C_PZK/1/details/</a>",1383836710

That made me back the DigiX, even though it&#x27;s a more complicated product.<p>I think the more ambitious the project is, and the less actual production experience the founders have, the more likely they are to run into problems. So that should be a big consideration when backing a project.",1383836476
6689638,comment,6687600,6689186,1,0,oblio,,,"Most of the things you mentioned can be solved in ~15 minutes, surely not a lot of extra effort.<p>And I&#x27;m not sure how a script that calls another script screws up monitoring.<p>Plus, if someone cares about high level stuff like monitoring but is worried that people&#x27;s tools might break if he changes script.sh to script.py later on, I think he needs to sort out the lower level stuff first. Like distribution and packaging :)",1383836459

Its important to keep in mind this book is published on Leanpub.com, a platform where authors publish unfinished books to get early feedback from readers. This book (like you&#x27;d expect of all Leanpub books), isn&#x27;t finished yet.<p>I should also add this was tested as a free email program before it was published as an e-book, and subscribers complimented me on its revelations. But all feedback is good, and more improvements are on the way. Purchasers will receive any and all updates, and at no extra cost.",1383836441

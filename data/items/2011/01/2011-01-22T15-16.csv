I was wondering about the motivation of library and framework maintainers. It wasn't my perception that the process leading up to Python 3 was anything like the kind of language creator ego trip you describe. It was a longish collective process and it has since been made very clear that further language changes are not in the cards any time soon.",1295711893

More likely, they've got some sparse set of addresses scattered all over the place, reflecting allocations to their subdivisions.<p>Hey, it's 1992; why <i>not</i> give that research group a /16 if you've got the bits?  There's no immediate need, but they might use some fraction of it <i>eventually</i>.  And they parcel out /8s to subgroups, a few at a time, averaging out to maybe a dozen machines (some groups with more, some with less).  Upshot:  in 2011, there's an internal /16 with a few hundred machines on it --- but reallocating it to a smaller CIDR block which reflects actual usage requires negotiations up and down the hierarchy.

I see people giving money to Dell.  I see people giving money to HP.  I see people giving money to Adobe and Microsoft ($deity only knows why).  I even see people giving money to Apple.<p>When was the last time I saw someone buy something from Google?  I've met two or three people with Android phones.  yeah, so Google gets what - a $10 royalty?

Google maps is awesome, but I never once paid for the privilege... how did they afford to put all those cars on the road eh?<p>What I see is things like Google buying youtube, and then making it worse by slapping ads on it.  I view Google as a modern day King Midas.  But they don't turn things to gold, what they touch gets covered in advertising instead.<p>Secondly, I have noted several instances where Google has been very 'cavalier' (to be generous) with the truth<p>(no we're not sniffing your wifi.  Okay, we're sniffing your wifi, but only accidentally.  Okay, we're doing it systematically and deliberately, but we're not storing it.  Okay, we're storing it, but nothing important.

That's not character.  That's not 'not being evil'.<p>===<p>NB: me saying Google is not perfect is not the same as saying that some other company is perfect.  what I was saying originally is that not only is it unfair to compare Google to Apple because of Apple's unusually good current results, but also they are different kinds of companies, working in mostly different markets (fundamentally Google is an internet based advertising company, and Apple is a media/hardware company - comparing them is like comparing a biotech stock with Walmart, it just doesn't make sense.

Then you slowly and carefully shut down your brain and just focus on the bright light. If a tought pops up the most important thing to remember is to let it go and focus away from it, if you get mad or focusing on not focusing on it that's one more tought that popped up.<p>Then once you get the hang of that you can start doing more interesting things. My favourite was to attempt super-position and out of body experiences. Basically you sit in a comfortable position and focus on a memory of a place, or a made-up place. You slowly build up the image of your surroundings, starting with what's immediately before your eyes and then going from there. Once you're proficient in building a visual representation of fake surroundings you start with sounds, smells and tastes. When you get that down you can start fooling your kinestatic sense, which means you have to <i>feel</i> your arms/legs/body in a different position than it actually is.<p>Once you've done that, voila, you've just achieved lucid REM at will.<p>If you talk to a spirituality guru they will tell you it's an astral plane, or out of body experience. But really it's just lucid REM :)<p>I never managed to quite completely detach myself from reality, I got into the super-position state where I could feel myself being in two places at once ... sort of everywhere.<p>The main thing you have to remember when doing any of these experiments is that your mind is the <i>only</i> thing in the world fully under your control.

You may be right - poverty might be caused by irrationality. I made no claim whatsoever about segregation, humiliation or other social problems.<p>Come to think of it, if the poor are irrational, that might also explain why their children do not become as intelligent as the children of the rich.",1295709936

2130479,comment,2130351,2130426,0,0,ctl,,,"It's possible, but I'd be pretty shocked. I've been doing mindfulness meditation for a few months and I feel fairly confident in saying that the belief that ""the operative part of meditation is sustained concentration"" is a misconception. When you meditate you allow yourself to become aware of your body sensations but you don't <i>force</i> yourself to concentrate on them, and I don't think that most meditators explicitly try to maintain concentration when they sit. (That said, after ten or fifteen minutes of meditation concentration often becomes natural.)<p>It certainly has seemed to me that the important part of meditation is the <i>relaxation</i> that it lets you achieve. I think it's literally impossible for me (at least) to get as relaxed as I am after a typical hour of meditation by any nonmeditative means. (If you interpret ""relaxation"" as having low blood levels of e.g. cortisol this is actually measurable.) And I know that I have days when I don't sufficiently relax myself when I sit, and I usually don't see the same benefits that I do from ""good"" sits. 'Course, a lot of this could be confirmation bias.<p>Also, anecdotally, I maintain substantial concentration for 30+ minutes a day because that's what studying is, and the short- and long-term effects of that concentration don't seem to be anything like the effects of meditation.",1295709436

I used to meditate daily for a few years in high school and then stopped for various more or less scary reasons.<p>There were three main effects I personally got from meditation:<p>1. A constant headache that lasted a few years and then promptly ended when I stopped meditating. Of course this could just be correlation, but it's one hell of correlation.<p>2. From my later experiences I found out that meditating that often and on that level (I could go into lucid REM within a minute of concentrating and then snap myself out of it at will) had a similar effect as constantly being on light doses of hallucinogenic drugs. It was really quite awesome, everything had a deep richness to it, colours were brighter, shapes were more pronounced etc.<p>3. Daily meditation also produced some quite interesting side-effects like being able to hold my breath for several minutes and reducing my heart rate to 40bpm (measured with an at-home cardiograph).<p>Another interesting effect of being able to go into REM at will was that I could live for a few years on 4 hours of daily sleep because I was in effect doing polyphasic sleep.<p>The only prolonged effect from meditation that I can still notice three-ish years after stopping is that I no longer dream like a normal person.<p>Maybe I should start meditating again, that stuff was kinda fun.",1295709005

For example, beating the S&P 500 over a certain time period is okay but if you&#x27;re doing it with a bunch of small- or mid-cap tech stocks, it&#x27;s quite possible you&#x27;re not being compensated adequately for the risk you&#x27;re taking.<p>For instance, if you&#x27;re investing in companies with a market cap less than $10 billion, the risk and overall effort you&#x27;re putting in is really indefensible if you aren&#x27;t beating the S&P Mid-Cap Index.

8676498,comment,8676110,8676428,0,0,aetherson,,,"I would guess that GPS experiences like the article mentions are either driver app errors or scaling problems.  That is, it sounds like the server is calculating the ETA of the driver based on a stale location.  The location would be stale either because the driver app is not updating it correctly or because even when it is updating location correctly, the server is (sometimes) using an older location, probably due to an eventually consistent data store.<p>When I worked for Flywheel (Uber competitor, same general needs of &quot;figure out the closest driver and provide an ETA&quot;), we&#x27;d occasionally see drivers whose phones seemed to get &quot;stuck&quot; in a location, essentially because the location service crashed in the O/S and would stop updating the app (though this was on Android phones and not iOS, and I&#x27;d be slightly surprised to see it happen in iOS).<p>But I think that the scaling issue is the most likely.  Location updates come fast and furious, and must be queried quickly.  I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if Uber is using some kind of big scalable highly available database that could in the event of fairly routine network partitions report stale driver locations some of the time, and/or a cache in front of their underlying store that sometimes fails to get invalidated.  That seems like it&#x27;s consistent with the experience of the driver that the problem tends to happen on particular nights (when they&#x27;re having some kind of underlying problem with, say, communication between components of their data store cluster), and why you might see it getting worse over time (as they scale).",1417342658

I have read that Steve Jobs had the best (or worst) of both worlds.<p>Take for example the quality of empathy - It consists of 2 aspects :- 1.The intellectual ability to put oneself in others shoes. 2. Too feel emotional pity/sympathy when something bad happens to them. It is shown that empathy is a key aspect lacking in psychopaths. As PG points out - empathy helps us to navigate the social world. Hence, such people have difficulty handling social situations.<p>Steve Wozniak who is a genuinely nice person had a strong sense of empathy and was motivated by it to help others (eg:- giving significant portion of his own shares to someone who was shortchanged during Apple&#x27;s IPO)<p>On the other hand Steve Jobs was what you would call a &quot;highly functioning sociopath&quot; - Someone who had strong emotional intelligence which could be used to great success in charming and manipulating people into doing one&#x27;s bidding while at the same time, having an almost pathological inability to feel any sympathy for others or remorse for one&#x27;s actions.(Take the same example where he refused to help out said employee or the time when he screwed over Woz). Unless I am mistaken, this aspect of Jobs&#x27;s character is hinted at in Walter Isaac&#x27;s biography of Steve.  I believe this rare combination of both high emotional intelligence and  cold ruthlessness was one of the key factors (among many others) in Steve Job&#x27;s success. I don&#x27;t want to over-exaggerate things or to imply that Jobs had absolutely no empathy (As a counter-example Jobs clearly loved his adoptive parents and felt great remorse over a relatively minor incident mentioned in the book) but he does seem to be an unusually mean person (much more than Bill Gate IMO).",1417342145

You cannot expect everybody reading your code to be using a good syntax highlighting scheme. Either way, I think code should be readable independent of editor features.<p>I have noticed that, if you make code readable without syntax highlighting, it&#x27;s always readable with syntax highlighting. The reverse is not true. I would even argue that the code readable without highlighting is more readable with highlighting than the code written just for highlighting.<p>I don&#x27;t use vertical alignment. I do think that a long list of vars is harder to read and vertical alignment helps with that. Yet, the solution for me is to attack the core problem. I reduce the number of moving parts inside a procedure, which you can be sure variables are.<p>Perhaps the author should improve the trivial examples by showing the code with syntax highlighting and vertical alignment.",1417342085

If you are doing a lot of floating point math you can check various modes. First try is always -Ofast which turns on -ffast-math flag. From the gcc page:<p><pre><code>    -ffast-math
    Sets -fno-math-errno, -funsafe-math-optimizations, -ffinite-math-only, -fno-rounding-math, -fno-signaling-nans and -fcx-limited-range.

    This option causes the preprocessor macro __FAST_MATH__ to be defined.

    This option is not turned on by any -O option besides -Ofast since it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
</code></pre>
I also remember that gcc started producing significantly faster code for my projects at around 4.7 or 4.8 version (can&#x27;t remember which one).",1417341975

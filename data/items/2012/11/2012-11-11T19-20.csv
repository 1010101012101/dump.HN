When Superbowl or Lady Gaga tickets go on sale, many people flood limited database servers and have to be put in a queue.  I can transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars with my smartphone - that's not a problem, but a vote which is worth nothing is going to be a target?  When Census forms are sent out, a code is sent by physical mail to addresses - that code, when entered online, can be used to fill out the form.  Or just fill out the paper form and drop it in the mail.  Trivial either way.  For that matter, thousands of organizations, not just Estonia, have binding internet votes every year.<p>When you read about people waiting seven hours in line, it's not unforeseen problems or incompetence; it's malice.  If you show me a story about people waiting seven hours in line, I'll show you a Democratic district in a state with Republican, partisan election officials.  Every time.  Those sorts of problems can't be solved by technology; they're people problems, not tech problems.  Right now, internet voting is a people problem, not a tech problem.  Internet voting might encourage more people to vote - and that's why Republicans are against it.",1352663728

It was common for kids to smoke weed after class and came to school drunk. As for the kids who went to school in the upper middle class town I grew up in, their problems included ODing on heroin. The kids that smoked weed might not have the most balanced careers, but that is a whole lot better than being dead because you ODed on heroin.<p>Of course that is all anecdotal.

Entropy demands that well-maintained culture must tend towards chaos as an organization grows.

marked my ballot"" part and ignore the rest of the voting ecosystem.<p>Registering voters implies maintaining a registration DB, and
handling moves, deaths, changes of name, changes of 
civil status that may disenfranchise or re-enfranchise a voter.<p>Preparing ballots, paper or otherwise, implies matching voters to
the appropriate ballot, precinct, or voting center.<p>Avoiding or invalidating multi-voting (in the same jurisdiction)
implies knowing whether a voter has or has not voted, and keeping
them from voting multiple times.<p>Counting paper ballots implies accounting for spoiled and unused
ballots and dealing with faint or unintended marks.<p>Secrecy of ballot implies that nobody else knows or can find out how
a voter actually voted (currently unless they show someone a mail-in
ballot before mailing it.)<p>Imagine the result of a smartphone app that wrapped around a voting
app, and offered to pay voters $50 to vote for or against a
candidate or ballot measure - even if the payoff app completely failed to
work, just the purported existence of such a tool might cast doubt
on a election result.<p>Voting online is not a ""greenfield"" problem - it would have to 
subsume a lot of previous experience and knowledge before being
thoroughly trusted by its users.<p>I would suggest to anyone exploring online voting that they get a
grassroots look at the current process - volunteer to be a elections
clerk (judge, watcher, etc.) at your next local election, and/or
become a voter registrar if your jurisdiction allows citizens to
fill that role.<p>If you'd rather just web-browse, I can recommend

that are scanned immediately in the voter's presence.  You get
the persistence of paper, immediate feedback for mismarks or
unscannable ballots, and good reproducibility of count if needed.<p>Also, if a surge of people arrives at a polling place, paper ballot
marking can be done in parallel, rather than having a bottleneck of a
few (expensive) machines that all voters must use (registration
look-up and ballot scanning are still bottlenecks).",1352661314

If you've ever heard of Mumps, this is it. The manuals date back to the early 80s. I am trying to build out some infrastructure so we can sensibly work with external research institutions in the San Diego area. I have figured out how to get some decent text out, which then needs to be parsed for specific things, which may vary depending on the project.<p>Think of this as a startup within the largest of large organizations. The downside is there's a huge bureaucracy. The upside is we're operating far enough up, that everybody understands the bureaucracy problems and some key people are willing to help facilitate some things along the way.<p>So my minimum viable product is a research paper published using 55 cases. Trivial, right? Maybe if you're at Stanford. Here, not so much. getting enough code written that I can automate the parsing and inject this (and some other similar files) into postgresql, and then pull data back out and do data analysis with it. I have struggled to find help. Joe has been very generous with helping me wrap my head around postgresql. I have been through a lot of python tutorials, but I have <i>never</i> sat down with someone who knows python and seen how they solve a problem. Go to a desert island and teach yourself python with nothing but the internet. Can it be done? Yes, but it is very hard.<p>So I'm hoping to build a relationship with someone who could help with practical matters, like finishing this first step of a small parser. Paul McGuire, the author of pyparsing, has been very helpful over Stack Exchange, but crafting a well-formed question on Stack Exchange is very difficult when, again, one learned to code on a desert island.<p>Here's my effort so far<p><a href=""https://github.com/2grep/CoPATH-Parser/blob/master/ProstateParser.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/2grep/CoPATH-Parser/blob/master/ProstateP...</a><p>Which I'm sure anyone here will look at and say: dude, you could have finished this by the time you wrote this comment!

4770261,comment,4769667,4770139,2,0,btilly,,,"Upvoted for the ""real difference"" link.<p>I personally think that both groups are doing it wrong.  I do a lot of A/B testing.  In A/B testing what you care about is this:<p>1. Not getting a horribly wrong answer.<p>2. Getting an answer quickly.<p>A frequentist can tell me how to avoid getting an answer, but has no idea of the fact that below some threshold of data any answer is likely to be chance, and the errors that I can make are severe.  And conversely if I have enough data, I'm likely to find real answers, and the mistakes I am likely to make are acceptable.<p>A Bayesian can tell me - in principle - that there is a threshold below which I should be cautious of making decisions and a threshold above which I can make decisions more easily.  But naive priors set those thresholds too low, and I do not have sufficient data to come up with a real prior to use.  I could create a conservative prior, but it would be hard to explain to anyone what I am doing.<p>In practice I've found that it is effective to blend the approaches.  I compute frequentist statistics, but based on my past experience and knowledge of the ease of making severe errors, I insist on very high confidence levels for low amounts of data, and much lower for high amounts of data.  Based on some numerical simulations, my true error rates seem acceptably low, and experiments run acceptably quickly.<p>(If I did not care about the speed of testing, then I could just set a rule like, ""Go with the first version to get 296 conversions ahead.""  If the two versions have conversion rates that differ by 1%, then 95% of the time I will get the right answer.  If the difference is larger, I will get the answer even more often.  If the difference is smaller I will get the wrong answer more often - but the errors that come will be small and on average I'm still making good business decisions.  All of the complex stats I actually do are just about getting answers quickly without compromising how often, on average, I make bad business decisions.)",1352660683

But then there was the 6 monthly version bump and all the extensions broke.<p>I have two problems.  The first (shared with Unity) is that I have a dual monitor setup with large screens.  I usually have at least two of each top level window (eg emacs, browser) and many terminals.  A panel has turned out to be the most productive way of managing them, providing the panel lets you do drag and drop to change ordering.  Every Gnome release cycle the old panels break, new ones appear, and they keep missing functionality.  The only way to get a decent stable usable one is to use fallback mode which Gnome is killing in the next release.<p>The second problem is ""random stuff"".  When I tried Gnome Shell the most recent time, the System Monitor applet showed up at the bottom and only if you moved your mouse to the bottom of the screen.  That is beyond spectacularly useless - it needs to be always visible.  You get many many niggles like that, that add up to a whole lot of annoyance.<p>It seems to me that the whole experience is being optimised for a single 11 inch screen where one program at a time is run.

1876364,comment,1875718,1876324,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Again, these are arbitrary words on paper. :) They could be changed or deleted or rearranged tomorrow if we wanted.<p>How I'm approaching it -- and this is really really important in order to understand why I'm saying what i'm saying so I'm going to draw it out a bit to emphasize it further -- is that we should listen to this story, and consider the details of this incident in terms of the physical activities that occurred, and the context in which it occurred, and come to our own independent judgement as to whether what happened was (1) evil, and (2) what was the magnitude of it (if it was), and (3) was their actual harm done (not imagined harm, not theorized harm, not genericized extrapolated harm, etc.) but real harm, and (4) if whether the very same incident were to occur except that the woman <i>liked</i> it, would we still consider it to be a big deal, and would we still consider it a crime or think it should be a crime.<p>I clearly am coming down on the side that says that what happened should not have happened, but, oh darn, it's really not that big of a deal and she'll be fine. The guy misread how forward he could be, and/or was drunk and/or she was also drunk, and/or one or both were flirtatious and things went too far. It can happen. It's going to happen. It will keep happening just as long as humans are sexual and have to play the mating dance with incomplete and imperfect knowledge of the other's intentions and desires, and heck, even of their own.<p>And look, by her own admission, it's not like a case where he dragged her into an alley at knifepoint and violently raped her, leaving her bruised, bleeding, in pain, etc. That is stereotypical rape, and is evil, and I think there's a very large social consensus that that is bad and should be a crime and be punished. We are <i>not</i> talking about <i>that</i> kind of event in this particular case. But some people seem to have the same emotional baggage in mind when they evaluate it. And I think that's a misleading and weak position to be arguing from.<p>I think I would care much less about this particular case if (1) the guy was not named, and (2) it was not blogged about publicly, and (3) here on HN. I mean at most, this is a situation for her, that other guy, and the legal system (and that, arguably) to deal with. The fact that it's been laundered here makes me want to play Devil's Advocate with the hopes of illustrating what I think are extremely important distinctions that should be considered, but often are not.",1289026371

Tell them you know it's less conventional, and make a simple justification for it.  A simple question I've gotten was designing a deck of cards in C++.  Instead of assigning a suit value of 1,2,3, or 4 I chose to use 1,2,4, and 8.  While the point of the exercise was to demonstrate OOP, I wanted to spice things up and show I was also comfortable working at the bit-level, using shifts and masks.  It probably didn't amount to much in and of itself, but I felt it made me more unique and that much more memorable.",1289026246

Only 30% of reported rapes and sexual assaults involve alcohol use on the part of the offender. (Keep in mind that this is reported rapes and sexual assaults; sexual crimes are extremely unreported.) The Center for Sex Offender Management quotes a 1998 Greenfield study when it says that ""[a]lcohol use, therefore, may increase the likelihood that someone already predisposed to commit a sexual assault will act upon those impulses. However, excessive alcohol use is not a primary precipitant to sexual assaults.""

He didn't casually touch her in a way anyone could have accidentally done in a crowded bar.<p>She said she was wearing a skirt and bike shorts (and presumably panties) underneath the skirt. To do what he allegedly did, he had to reach <i>under</i> her skirt (already <i>not</i> a socially acceptable action) and get past two layers of fabric and elastic (and bike shorts fit pretty tight). He didn't touch her <i>through</i> her clothing, or touch some 'taboo' area revealed via skimpy clothing. <i>He would have had to physically move her clothing out of the way in order to touch her genitals after being explicitly told that she did not want to be touched by him.</i><p>I don't see why you are so up for debating the semantics of the phrase 'sexual assault'.<p>Here's a thought experiment. You (I am assuming you are a heterosexual man, maybe you are, maybe you aren't, but I'm betting I'm right) go to a tech conference. You go to an after-party, have a few beers, have fun, chat with your peers. Another guy comes up to you and asks if you want to talk. You say sure. Suddenly grabs you and kisses you. You shove him away and say, ""Whoa man, sorry, I don't go that way."" He then grabs your belt buckle with one hand and shoves the other down the front of your pants and squeezes your cock.<p>Do you feel violated? Have you been assaulted? Hell yes, you were just sexually assaulted, 'in the particulars of your specific case'. And it's horrible. And it should not happen.<p>Edited to Note:<p>I only chose the homosexual example to highlight the fact that the physical contact was undesired. My point stands equally even if it were <i>the hottest woman in the world</i> and after the kiss you said, 'No sorry, I'm married.' or <i>any other type of no including just straight up 'No'.</i> If after the no, she still reached down your pants and grabbed your genitals it would <i>still be sexual assault</i>.<p>And while after reading some of your other posts I gather you feel our current sexual assault laws are too broad, and I support your right to have that opinion, and indeed even open a dialogue about it or campaign to have the law changed in your jurisdiction, I find it in extremely poor taste to have said dialogue in the commentary of such a clear example of sexual assault.",1289025337

While basic blocks are completely predictable traces through the program, they are usually very short.  You can get much more benefit by finding long common traces through multiple basic blocks and compiling the whole thing as a unit, providing tests and/or fixup code in case you find you actually needed to branch somewhere else in the middle of a trace.

Of course, that presupposes a running sshd on dest.host.com.  You could secure it from being observed (although not from being interfered with) under Linux using loopback devices:<p><pre><code>    ## On the destination machine:
    LOD=`losetup -f`

But he has to realize the generosity she's displaying here, and reciprocate ten-fold.<p>To me that would be evidence that someone was not only shocked by their behavior, but sincere about being shocked, and willing to make it right.

1876279,comment,1875718,1876217,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Here's a thought experiment. Say we define ""sexual assault"" as being any case where a person is touched on their skin by another person, without that other person first getting explicit permission from the ""victim"" person to do that. By that definition, I'd wager that 99%+ of all women alive today have been sexually assaulted -- or if they haven't already, 99% will be.<p>Now, in this thought experiment, let's start narrowing the requisite conditions. Say, that the area touched has to be near genitals or buttocks or breasts. Bet the percentage drops some, but still high. Let's say we widen it so it can be outside of clothing -- not necessarily on bare skin. Guess what, the percentage goes back up. Now let's specify that the touchee is not sexually attracted to the toucher. Percentage drops. Now we could narrow it further, or widen it, whatever, and we're going to end up with whatever percentage we want -- even one we want to call ""high"" or ""prevalent"" or an ""epidemic"", if we wanted. Let's add in some error margins and uncertainty because (1) people don't always tell the truth, and (2) people don't always remember things perfectly. Now the importance and validity of your percentage becomes, well, let's say arguable and ambiguous, at best.<p>Have some women been ""raped"" (in the clearest, most old fashioned sense of the word) -- hell yes. And that's horrible. And should not happen. But to say that a third of all women are ""sexually assaulted"" in their lifetimes and/or to say that that is (always and necessarily) an evil thing -- that part I'm not so sure of.<p>Rape? Bad.<p>Sexual assault? Depends on particulars of the specific case -- not what words/laws say.",1289023259

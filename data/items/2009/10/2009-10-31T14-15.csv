{
   writeln(""about to do something important"");
   doSomethingImportant();
}<p>is this really not going to run doSomethingImportant() if the writeln fails?  I find that to be a poor default for a systems language.<p>This may just be a personal preference, but I strongly want a <i>systems</i> language to do one of 2 things:<p>1) Require me to explicitly state when I care about an operation failing
2) At compile time ensure that my code explicitly states when it's not going to handle an exception.  (Java with this, like so many things, gets it 90% right and then falls on its face)<p>Silently passing exceptions out to the system is a bad default for something that is supposed to be able to be used to build the system!<p>Note that this preference does not apply for a large swath of applications programming.  For a webapp, it may be reasonable to log any uncaught error conditions to a log file, since we can just signal the client to try again.",1257001099

Getting participants from outside the Schengen in, just for non-work visits, is also a big nuisance. So at a meeting we adopted a resolution to be put in front of the relevant EU officials that a special youth NGO visa should be put in place (not surprisingly, nothing happened).<p>If it was, it would have been nice for us, but I have roughly the same feeling then than I have towards this: ""We"" (not me since I'm not a US citizen and as such don't really get to lobby the US government) are lobbying for something that good for us and ""our"" people by arguing it's for the greater good of society. But in fact, were we to get this adopted, we'd only further complicate a complicated and broken system.<p>""Me too"" exceptions are poisoning pretty much all areas of the political system in most of the ""first"" world, and only serves to get in the way of actual reform.<p>I'd love to come to the US and work for a startup.

913563,comment,911973,912100,0,0,david,,,"Of course visual design always comes second to the quality of the actual product/experience, but that doesn't mean design isn't important.<p>A company's brand is a reflection of their user experience. The main contributer to Coca-Cola's brand, then, is in the actual drink itself. Graphic design, logo design, or identity design is important not because it can really alter the branding or make a bad product look good, but because they can make that branding more apparent to someone before they even take a sip, and guide them towards whatever decisions happen to be the most profitable for Coca-Cola.<p>So for example, a good Coca-Cola logo would give people the idea that coke is more refined/sophisticated, and is made to be appealing throughout the entire drink, instead of sacrificing total experience for a short rush of sugar flavor. That would get the attention of people who are looking for that sort of drink, and filter out the people who might be better served by pepsi. Whereas, if they had a logo that lead to a greater feeling of spectacle than sophistication, it would be more likely that people who wouldn't appreciate coke would try it (deciding they don't like it and going back to pepsi), and the people who would buy coke would be less likely to consider it.<p>That's why logo design is important. You may have a great product, but if your visual identity doesn't reflect that, your marketing efforts will be spent fighting against your image rather than running alongside it.",1256998958

913544,comment,913311,913311,0,0,amalcon,,,"Perhaps virtual economies defy the rules of my old college textbooks because, so do real economies?  One thing that's become abundantly clear is that, if economists know how economies work, they're not demonstrating that knowledge.<p>This being said, if one uses a post-Keynesian model, it matches most video games very well.  According to such a model, in the real world, any payment or loan by the government is simply a ""source"", and any payment (i.e. taxes/interest) or loan to the government is simply a ""sink"".  From here, if your only goal is to stabilize inflation at a particular level, you need to reduce sources or increase sinks until such time as inflation reaches that level.  This idea gets into trouble in the real world when you have competing goals, but it's probably fine for an MMO.<p>Post-Keynesian theory has its share of problems, but to its credit, it doesn't start by assuming that the amount of money in play is fixed.  That makes it as close as we have to ideal for modeling videogame economies.",1256997928

If you do not want to pay taxes, you always have the option to leave the safety of the system (move to another country or declare war on the country taxing you).<p>Although it is likely infeasible and anti-social to declare war (however, it has been done many times), I don't doubt you could find a country with lower taxes. The issue, however, would then be being able to make the same amount of money as you would in a country with higher taxes. That is to say, you get what you pay for.<p>Essentially you are discounting (wholesale!) the benefits that you, the individual, derive from having a working system of government. Yes, the immediate and obvious benefits are small, but the benefits that you essentially take for granted, certainly are not small.<p>I think the quote that life would be ""nasty, brutish, and short"".<p>I did the math prior to posting and I do realize that (depending on the sum of money), it could be a very good deal for the investee.<p>It just seems to have elements of a Faustian bargain.",1256997833

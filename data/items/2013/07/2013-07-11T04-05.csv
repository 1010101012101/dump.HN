6024462,comment,6024094,6024094,49,0,david_shaw,,,"This is going to be my tenth (?!) year at DEF CON.<p>The culture of DEF CON, and especially its evolution, is a very interesting one. When I first attended DEF CON, it was a bunch of seemingly scary hackers. Fortunately, it turns out most of them were amazing people.<p>As the conference grew (and changed venues several times), the culture began to evolve. The barrier to entry--in terms of being &quot;accepted&quot; into the subculture--lowered significantly. DEF CON stopped being a scary place, with goons that would &quot;de-tech&quot; you and throw you in the pool, and more of a mainstream event. For the most part, I&#x27;m completely supportive of where DEF CON&#x27;s going. I&#x27;m <i>definitely</i> supportive of air conditioning in the venue, instead of standing outside in the sweltering Las Vegas summertime heat.<p>That said, though, it&#x27;s not really a &quot;hacker conference&quot; anymore. Not more than its sister conference, Black Hat, or something like RSA, anyway.<p>DEF CON used to be about <i>hacking</i>. Not in the HN sense, but in the &quot;illegal entry into networks&quot; definition. Now, it&#x27;s less about hacking and more about the actual information security industry; this is probably related to the fact that everyone I knew at the first DEF CON I attended (myself included) currently works in the infosec industry.<p>With growth, exposure, and the inclusion of white hats, DEF CON naturally became a recruiting ground for federal agencies, including law enforcement, the military, intelligence, etc. The &#x27;spot the fed&#x27; game that began as a joke (with prizes!) soon seemed silly, since there were so many federal employees/recruiters/agents.<p>I&#x27;m all for DEF CON entering the mainstream. It&#x27;s a conference and community that I&#x27;ve grown to love, and the lessons I&#x27;ve learned there (not to mention the friends I&#x27;ve made) have helped me immensely--both personally and professionally. That said, though, there&#x27;s pretty much zero chance that this announcement DT made will have any effect whatsoever on federal agents, recruiters or representatives attending the con. More than anything, it&#x27;s a huge publicity stunt.<p>After all, most of the staff and &quot;old school&quot; attendees work for &quot;the man&quot; now. For some, like me, it&#x27;s just hacking for money; many, though, actually <i>do</i> work for defense and intelligence contractors. Should they be banned because of their affiliation?<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think so.<p>PS: If you&#x27;re considering going to DEF CON and you&#x27;ve never been, you should! It&#x27;s a booze-fueled learning, partying and networking event unlike any other. Plus, you get to hang out in Vegas for a weekend!",1373516991

Besides, any reasonable person who felt threatened by my dog(s) would see the results of my commands and the situation would thereby pose no threat to the police.<p>From there I could tell the dogs to <i>play dead</i> and further defuse the situation.<p>The bottom line is that dog owners need to maintain control of their dogs at all times.
There are too many dunderheads out there who think it&#x27;s cool to have a bad ass dog yet have no idea about how to maintain those dogs in a proper fashion.<p>Living in the country, as I have for most of my life, we don&#x27;t see too many of these types of police actions, as being in such a close-knit community, everyone knows what everyone else is up to, so the police in this county rarely, if ever, break down the wrong door.
I have a long driveway and can see who is coming up to the house from quite a distance, so I don&#x27;t see how anyone could storm my house without being seen, and once I&#x27;ve identified the interlopers as police I would make sure to place my dogs in their kennels.<p>I guess that&#x27;s why I live where I do. I like it this way.<p>This is not meant to be a defense of the reprehensible police tactics outlined in the article, but rather an example of one way to deal with one&#x27;s dog(s) in a responsible manner.",1373516883

Because of this, spells are significantly weaker in the early game (due to the fact that you can get items to boost their power as the game progresses).  There are no +magic damage items in DotA, so spells are significantly more powerful early game but become less effective compared to auto attack damage as the game progresses.",1373516317

I have seen many startups claim that their users by using their service will get above average returns.<p>So if their service provides above average returns why are they even selling the service, just trade/invest your own money and you will be rich in no time.<p>The reason we started Craytheon because we wanted a service which would help us make better investment decisions in the stock market.

Gates chooses to direct his charity one way, Buffet does his thing, and Page has his angle.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with different people choosing different aspects of the overall situation, and focusing on the aspects that they care about.<p>I often daydream about what I&#x27;d do if I was billg rich.  And I keep coming to the conclusion that there are certain, very specific charitable activities that I&#x27;d choose to fund, and they wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be the same ones that gates chooses.  For example, my prime angle would be to focus on poverty by contributing funds to help with education for disadvantaged people, and by focusing on programs that teach and promote entrepreneurship.  Now, does that mean that I don&#x27;t care about people with polo, or malaria, or people in developing countries who need clean water?  No, it just means that I&#x27;d choose to address the things that resonate with me for whatever reason, while acknowledging that one person can&#x27;t do it all.<p>It sounds to me like Page just has his vision of how he would want to help make the world better, and I don&#x27;t see how it makes sense to criticize him just because his hot buttons aren&#x27;t the same as yours (or mine, or whoever).",1395345529

7438169,comment,7404594,7437617,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>The first probe moves toward infinity. The second probe toward the singularity.</i><p>Globally, yes. Within the LIF, it&#x27;s impossible to tell, just from the way either probe is moving within the LIF, what is going to happen to it after it leaves the LIF.<p>Also, to the extent that &quot;toward infinity&quot; and &quot;toward the singularity&quot; can be defined within the LIF, they aren&#x27;t the directions you think they are--more precisely, the latter isn&#x27;t. See below.<p><i>They each move toward destinations beyond opposite sides of the LIF.</i><p>This is wrong and I&#x27;ve already explained why it&#x27;s wrong, but I&#x27;ll recap again since apparently you aren&#x27;t reading my posts very carefully. The singularity is not in the negative x direction in the LIF; it&#x27;s in the positive t direction, i.e., in the future. Infinity is more or less in the positive x direction, yes. But that means that <i>both</i> probes, as far as you can tell within the LIF, are moving in <i>both</i> directions: toward the singularity (in the positive t direction) <i>and</i> toward infinity (in the positive x direction). There&#x27;s no way to tell, from within the LIF, where the probes will end up.<p>(You could, of course, define &quot;toward the singularity&quot; as &quot;decreasing r coordinate&quot; and &quot;toward infinity&quot; as &quot;increasing r coordinate&quot;; but as I have already shown multiple times, the respective probes satisfy those definitions while both moving in the positive x direction within the LIF; and as I&#x27;ve also said multiple times, the r coordinate is irrelevant to the LIF since it&#x27;s global, not local.)<p><i>you wouldn&#x27;t be able to show that the probes approach each other in the skydiver&#x27;s frame</i><p>Wrong; I already have. But if it will help, I am working on a second spacetime diagram that shows the skydiver&#x27;s LIF, to complement the one showing the black hole LIF that I already posted on PhysicsForums (see the link I posted in this thread). What that diagram will show is that the <i>only</i> difference between the two LIFs is how the lines of constant r coordinate appear; everything else is identical.<p><i>given the first probe moving toward higher r-coordinates and the second probe moving toward lower r-coordinates</i><p>This isn&#x27;t true in the skydiver&#x27;s LIF; it&#x27;s only true in the black hole LIF. As I&#x27;ve already pointed out. And which is irrelevant to the equivalence principle anyway, since the r coordinate is global, not local. How many times are you going to repeat the same erroneous statements?<p><i>GR places additional conditions on what happens in a LIF, when it predicts that everything below a horizon falls toward the singularity</i><p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. You can give a definition of what &quot;toward the singularity&quot; means in a given LIF (I did it above for the black hole LIF--note that it isn&#x27;t what you think it is); but you can&#x27;t restrict what happens within a given LIF based on which direction &quot;toward the singularity&quot; is. All a global definition like &quot;toward the singularity&quot; does is tell you the relationship between local conditions in the LIF and some global condition. That can help you to determine what the right local conditions are in an LIF to model some desired global condition; but it can&#x27;t ever tell you that a given local condition that would be permissible in special relativity is not permissible in an LIF.<p><i>we must be able to set up a thought experiment that accounts for that prediction within an LIF straddling the horizon.</i><p>Yes, and I&#x27;ve already shown, multiple times, how the thought experiment we&#x27;ve been discussing does this.<p><i>For example, it&#x27;s okay to have an experiment in an LIF that says &quot;fire a particle toward Vega&quot;, even though Vega is outside the LIF, as long as the measurements take place wholly within the LIF.</i><p>Sure; and the way you would model that experiment is to determine what condition in the LIF corresponds to the global condition &quot;fire a particle toward Vega&quot;.<p>Similarly, in the thought experiment under discussion, the way we model it in the LIF crossing the horizon is to determine what local condition in that LIF corresponds to &quot;the first probe is fired at escape velocity just outside the horizon&quot;, and &quot;the second probe is fired at a higher velocity, relative to the astronaut, than the first probe, but just inside the horizon&quot;. And then we have to check that the two probes&#x27; trajectories, in the LIF, that we come up with meet the criteria of &quot;first probe is moving toward infinity&quot; and &quot;second probe is moving toward the singularity&quot;. And I&#x27;ve already shown, multiple times, how all these conditions are met, and how your claims that they are not met are based on an erroneous understanding of how the global conditions translate into local conditions in the LIF.<p>At this point, I&#x27;m tempted to conclude that you&#x27;re not really trying to understand my posts, but just looking for things to disagree with based on the erroneous straw-man version of relativity that you have in your head. You keep on repeating the same errors, even though I&#x27;ve already shown why they&#x27;re errors, and you keep on missing the things I&#x27;m telling you about how relativity actually models this scenario, that address the concerns you&#x27;re raising. I really think you need to step back and take an honest look at what I&#x27;ve been saying.",1395345241

7438038,comment,7436969,7437757,6,0,tomblomfield,,,"I disagree - I think we&#x27;re talking about two competing philosophies.<p>DHH / standard-Rails seems to encourage you to fit things into Models, Views or Controllers. Models got too fat, and so Concerns were introduced. This is problematic, because you still have massive god-models, but now their code is split between a dozen different files, called &quot;Concerns&quot;. The main problem is that by making ActiveRecord models the <i>core</i> of your application, you generally give each model too much responsibility & too much knowledge of its associated objects. This means it&#x27;s very hard to break down & recompose the different functionality into new objects. A model only functions correctly if all of its associated objects are present. This is tight coupling.<p>The alternative view is to introduce several new single-responsibility objects like Interactors/Service-Objects (and Policies, as here) which should contain the core of your application&#x27;s business logic. These Service Objects are the <i>opposite</i> of concerns - they do <i>not</i> extend the API of models. They exist to control the interactions between the models. The models become dumb interfaces that deal with data validation and persistence. Because they know hardly anything about the other objects in the system, and have very limited APIs, they can be passed around easily, and re-composed into more complex interactions. They are also incredibly simple to test. The same applies to Interactors - they should be broken down into small units of behaviour with very limited APIs, which can then be passed around easily and composed into more complex interactions. This is loose coupling.",1395344297

In retrospect too many of my first couple of calls ended with... &quot;So uh yeah, I&#x27;ll email you I guess.&quot;<p>Me and my cofounder have been doing test-runs of sales just to test if there was interest in our market. We  made a note to take time out of developing to call 20 vendors a day. Some things we found:<p>1) Doing cold alone is nerve-racking, doing sales with a friend is actually pretty fun. It&#x27;s almost nostalgic of crank-calling people as a kid. You can joke about the interesting run-ins you have with vendors. My cofounder and I grab snacks and just spend an afternoon calling.<p>2) We rate each call with &quot;likelihood ratings (1-10 rating of how the call went). These are just qualitative ratings about the disposition of the caller on the other line. Every 50 or so we take note of what language improves the mood, and what turns people off. This way we&#x27;re consistently improving our pitch.<p>3) Early on we let the initial tone of the calls dictate their end result. Too many calls ended more abruptly than they should have.(because we perceived that the other end was too disinterested to sway.) But we quickly noted was that many of the vendors had the same objections. It was an easy fix, just come up with a list of simple, logical retorts. There&#x27;s many calls that we talked out of a ditch. -It&#x27;s like when you solve yourself out of a cluster-fuck in 2048 :)<p>4) I&#x27;m not a very extroverted person, I don&#x27;t have a marketing background. But I&#x27;ve actually come to like the calls. The first call of the day is always the hardest. The initial dip into a chilly pool is unpleasant, but you get over it much quicker than you would think. I talked to many interesting people just through cold calls. At first I scoured my network trying to find someone to delegate this task to, now it&#x27;s part of the daily work schedule.<p>5) Ask for the close, just let them say &quot;No&quot;. Don&#x27;t dance around it. In the bigger picture who cares that one person said &quot;No&quot;.<p>TL,DR Technical Cofounders can operate telephones; thus they can make sales calls.

Back in 2010 fiscal year Hyatt only generated $66M of net income. Why? Because hotels generally have high operating leverage (i.e. high fixed costs) and low margins, so small downturns in demand for rooms can have a large impact on profits. And frankly, AirBnB is helping depress demand for hotel rooms.<p>2. now think about AirBnB&#x27;s business. They take 3% of every booking and they probably have low incremental costs (just additional server capacity).<p>The article below says they booked 12-15M in rooms in 2012. At an average of $100/room night (probably conservative) .. that&#x27;s ~$1B in bookings with $30M going to AirBnB.<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-billion-revenues-2013-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-billion-revenues-2013-...</a><p>We know AirBnB has grown rapidly ... and in the article they say they think they can serve 100 million in bookings per year ... which would equate to revenue of $300M. You can start to see how AirBnB could in fact produce as much profit as Hyatt without owning hundreds of properties.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t bet against companies that combine economies of scale and customer captivity. I&#x27;d say that AirBnB has customer captivity because of the difficultly of establishing &#x27;trust/credibility&#x27;. Once a user has established that credibility at one site I think they&#x27;re fairly captive.<p>Anyway, time will tell. It&#x27;s going to be fascinating to watch.",1395343821

I see your point and it&#x27;s hard to argue with, but I think there is a line somewhere where the nature of the surveillance changes because of the scale.  We&#x27;ve got a lot of legislation and jurisprudence that is probably implicitly based on the assumption that not every corner has a cop sitting there watching everyone 24/7, and that constrains the potential for abuse a bit.  Crank it up to virtual, unsleeping cops everywhere, always, collecting and storing all information without regard to active cases, and it gets out of hand.<p>Maybe we should re-examine the analogy -- are computers with perfect vision, that never look away, and perfectly record any observation they are able to make, really comparable to cops?

There is Andrea Luzzardi, Joffrey Fuhrer and myself toiling away and going door to door showing our work to various engineering teams in the San Francisco area. Invisible in this video is an early proof-of-concept written in Python by another Dotcloud employee, Francois-Xavier Bourlet. We ended up going for another architecture and rewriting the code in Go, but it&#x27;s Francois-Xavier who came up with the name Docker :)<p><i>[01m21s]</i> On March 13 you can see a sudden burst of activity. This is when we decided to go all in. We flew all remote employees in and commandeered half of the company to work on Docker full-time for 2 weeks to test it, document it, improve it etc. The other half would hold the fort and continue running the existing product. In parallel we gradually give early access to more and more friends in the engineering community - at this point about 50 people have access to the Github repository, from companies like Uber, Twilio, Meteor, Stripe, Soundcloud, Ebay, Heroku etc.<p><i>[01m34s]</i> On March 20 Docker is &quot;leaked&quot; to Hacker News [1] after my lightning talk at Pycon (we expected 30 fellow lxc nerds, but it turns out Pycon lightning talks are a huge thing with an audience in the hundreds... oops!). Note that there is not much change in activity, because the repository is not yet open-source, so it is shielded from the buzz. The term &quot;vaporware&quot; starts being used, oh no! We rush madly to release the code ahead of schedule.<p><i>[01m51s]</i> On March 27, one week after the &quot;leak&quot;, we are finally ready to open the repository. After the HN announcement [2], pull requests start pouring in amazingly quickly. You can also see the documentation being merged into the main repository at the last minute.<p><i>[06m27s]</i> On September 13 after an epic thread on the mailing list [3], we starting vendoring Go dependencies. You can clearly see all the new files appearing, then sitting there pretty much untouched except for the occasional update. Note: vendoring worked just fine for us.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5408002"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5408002</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5445387"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5445387</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/docker-dev/vendoring/docker-dev/VeB_vmIMONc/xoS-yqKNZXsJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/docker-dev/vendor...</a>",1395343045

Answer no: you must annotate parameters and return types.<p>It would be pretty much impossible to implement total type-inference without loosing separate compilation in Hack.\nPHP projects are not organized around a module system, which means that you have &quot;spaghetti&quot; dependencies, and even better, cyclic dependencies all over the place.<p>So trying to implement total type-inference would be a bad idea, you would not be able to separate the code in independent entities and the checker would not scale.<p>2) Does Hack support structural sub-typing? Answer: No, but not for obvious reasons.<p>Fun fact, the first version of the type-checker was implementing structural sub-typing. And it was not scaling, for subtle reasons.<p>Hack allows covariant return types, so if we implemented structural sub-typing we would have to &quot;dive&quot; into the return types of each method to see if they are compatible. But in turn, these objects could have covariant return types etc ... The process of checking that was too inefficient. Caching is a bad idea (or at least a non trivial idea to implement), because of constraints and type-variables.<p>Since disallowing covariant return types was not an option (it was crucial to make a lot of code work), we had to kill structural sub-typing.<p>I hope this answers your question. As a big OCaml fan myself, I <i>like</i> the features you just mentioned (Well, Hack is written in OCaml), but they really didn&#x27;t seem to be a good fit due to the nature of the language and the kind of checking speed we were shooting for.",1395342948

For now, I have a couple more details.<p>We&#x27;re using the closure_tree gem to give a hierarchy to the permissions; every permission can have a parent, which may further limit which abilities are allowed on a managable by a manager. This means that if user A has abilities &quot;1,2,3&quot; on an object, when he grants a permission to user B, while he can create the permission with whatever abilities he wants (maybe abilities &quot;2,3,4&quot;), the parent of that user B&#x27;s permission is user A&#x27;s permission, which restricts the real abilities user B has so that user B effectively has only abilities &quot;2,3&quot; on that object. To do this, we get the whole ancestor chain and take the intersection of all the abilities of each permission.<p>We also have organization objects; these are the owners of everything in the system - they own the users, the roles, the permissions, etc. Organizations may also be a manager or a managable; in fact, an organization automatically gets a permission with itself as both the manger and the managable, with every ability. We also use closure_tree with organizations: when an organization is the managable part of a permission, that permission applies to everything the organization owns, including all descendants.<p>So we have permissions with a hierarchy where we look upward at its ancestors to limit its abilities, and organizations with a hierarchy where we look down to find the scope that permission operates on.",1395342835

That&#x27;s part of the reason there&#x27;s a whole new breed of funded enterprise companies out there -- they&#x27;re taking lessons from the web/apps and applying them to replace old-school solutions.

For parameter types our hands were tied, since PHP actually already has this syntax for object types (unless we wanted to needlessly break compatibility here). We just extended it with primitive types, generics, etc. For return types, we wanted to preserve the greppability of &quot;function add&quot; in large codebases, both for the actual &quot;grep&quot; tool itself as well as for any other tools like ctags that look for strings like this.",1395342210

I was just about to ask questions related to how this differs from the GeekDesks we are using now, before I decided to play through the whole video.<p>After watching the video, I saw it was mentioned that the horizontal stabilizer was removed, which saves on material costs.

Currently I&#x27;ve found the GeekDesk to flex a little more than I would like when at standing height and I lean on it.",1395342141

I&#x27;m sure they want to stay as opaque as possible while the regulatory landscape settles into place. Going public would force a lot more transparency and potentially weaken their negotiating position.<p>As for people doubting their valuation and comparing it to hotels; keep in mind that hotels have no way to scale the way AirBnB does, nor can hotels cater to niche geographic areas the way AirBnB does. It is not a stretch to see AirBnB becoming the defacto start when searching for a place to stay and if that happens, hotels may find themselves subordinate to AirBnB.",1395342061

As our industry evolves and we develop more reliable ways to achieve our goals, something that we regarded as being a relatively stable foundation in the past may no longer be regarded as such in the future when our standards have risen. Moreover, what constitutes &quot;long term&quot; might vary wildly among different projects.<p>I suppose my basic objection to the original claim (that building atop crumbling foundations is by far the most successful way to accomplish anything in computing) is that significant achievements in computing tend not to happen overnight but rather to develop over time, and the more stable your foundations, the better chance your project has of developing far enough to achieve significant things.",1395342020

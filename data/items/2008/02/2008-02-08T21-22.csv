112375,comment,112065,112065,0,0,kcl,,,"Corporations won't benefit from gambling on more expensive programmers. They've already created a structure that takes in programmers, anyone with even a basic proficiency, and ensures that they produce at some specified minimum. It's a system that grinds down anyone with lofty ideas about programming, but it's also a system that's relatively riskless, and that's all large corporations care about---eliminating risk. (Particularly in a department that isn't responsible for generating revenue.)<p>No matter how bad you are, as long as you're consistently churning out code, in whatever language, enough work is being done that the project moves ahead. It doesn't matter who does it, and at this level of quality it doesn't matter who sits down to work on it (this is huge to anyone in charge of staffing the department).<p>It's a model that seems to have evolved organically inside the corporation, rather than as some anti-programmer conspiracy, but certainly smart executives at Microsoft and the banks have recognized it for years.<p>If ThoughtWorks doesn't use this model, and it benefits them, why are they more expensive? If you're paying less overall for talent, you can increase sales by charging less for the same product. When you save on production costs you don't raise prices to celebrate. His evidence only contradicts his claim.<p>If you amend his blog post to say, ""well...you pay more for a higher quality version of the same thing"", then what he's saying isn't news to anyone, and his old thesis becomes wrong.<p>[Software that works 97% of the time and software that works 99.9% of the time look very, very different at the code level. The user, however, can't tell the difference. More to the point, they won't pay for it.]",1202507858
112374,comment,110412,110684,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Hmm, . . ., I can definitely understand skepticism with regards to China opening itself up to international information exchange, but honestly, I think that it's becoming more and more critical for China to do so.<p>For one thing, China is currently on a huge push to expand scientific research ties with foreign powers.  There have been several articles recently, especially in Seed magazine, about China's desire to forge stronger research links with other Asian countries (especially India and Japan), as well as Western powers (the EU and USA).  Now I could be wrong (international relations and national development are FAR from being areas of my expertise), but it seems a truism to me that China will at some point HAVE to start liberalizing its information policies.  This goes both for domestic things (free press, free speech, etc.) and for foreign interchange of ideas (tearing down the great firewall, for instance.)<p>Again, not a topic I know scads about, but it seems like if China wants to play nice with foreign powers in academic/intellectual arenas, they'll need to dear down some walls, inluding firewalls.",1202507828

112352,comment,110571,112076,0,0,papersmith,,,"I think for most public web sites, keeping sessions in a LRU cache like memcached shouldn't be a problem, since it automatically purges the relatively inactive sessions.  Assuming each session uses up 100k, which is a lot if the user is not writing a novel, you can still keep 10,000 active sessions in 1GB of memory.  If you think the sessions are purged too early, you can add more ram, or more boxes, since memcached is distributed.  Last I checked facebook had a 3TB memcached cluster.  But ya, if the sessions are small enough you might as well pass them to the clients.",1202506117

112337,comment,111956,112103,0,0,zach,,,"The ""eventually everything will be massively parallel"" argument is not very convincing.  The Be guys made this argument 15 years ago and we're only now getting to where they were back then (2/4 processor cores).  Consumers aren't that excited by more cores, and developers still don't know what to do with them.  So there is massive investment in advancing the status quo.<p>Sony thought they could impose the PS3's multiprocessing regime on game developers through market force.  But developers found the programming overhead unmanageable, which led to a less-than-compelling lineup, which failed to interest consumers, which means that now developers just work on the Xbox 360 version and port to PS3.<p>I was offered a job porting an existing game engine to the PS3 under the gun (the game had to ship in six months) and I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole.",1202504522

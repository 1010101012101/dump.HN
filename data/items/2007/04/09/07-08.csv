10694,comment,10667,10674,0,0,dhouston,,,"there are some other signs they don't really get it, as far as dealing with students. the most obvious one to me is requiring teams to be on site in lexington. first, commuting from boston or cambridge is a pain if you don't have a car (there's certainly no T or commuter rail, maybe bus or bike if you're extraordinarily motivated), and second, the hours of a VC certainly aren't compatible with the hours of a startup hacker unless they plan to have kids roaming around the office park at 2am (right..)<p>it'll be interesting to see how these summer programs continue to segment themselves to accommodate niches that are generally excluded by yc (techstars/single founders, highland/students, etc., ) most amusingly the ""mistakes"" :) ",1176105250

I understand that he is probably busy right now, so there is no rush, really.<p>I have given 2 suggestions (shortcut icon and new display order for threads page) and 1 bug-fix/suggestion (regarding < and >), in addition to adding a simple suggestion to a feature request proposed regarding allowing descriptions for submissions (by using the title property of <a> elements).  I think that at least 3 of these issues would be somewhat trivial to implement (everything except changing display order of threads page).",1176105215

10691,comment,363,363,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Bug report: In order to include a < or > sign in your post, you have to write &lt; or &gt;.  This is fine (although a bit cumbersome), but when you later want to edit the comment, instead of placing &lt; in the text box, < shows up instead, so that every time you want to edit the comment, you have to change every < to &lt;.  (The same thing occurs with >, too.)<p>I'm thinking this problem would be easy to fix, but I'm also curious: why can't we just write e.g. < and have it be converted to &lt; at post-time?  Of course, it would still need to be converted back at edit time, but I think it would make posting code or html snippets much simpler.<p>Ironically, I just edited this post for about the 3rd time.",1176104958

10687,comment,10667,10674,0,0,rms,,,"While there's some overlap, Lightspeed and Highland aren't directly copying YC in the same way as the complete plagiarism of Techstars.<p>Lightspeed and Highland are doing this more for marketing than profit. They're not even taking any equity. It gets their name out to entrepreneurial students at colleges and that's about it. Anyone that gets a grant will pitch future startups to the VC that helped them get started. To the VCs, it's worth spending a mere $150,000 to build a strong relationship with some of the best young entrepreneurs. Sure, most of the startups will go back to school after the summer program instead of dropping out and being successful but they'll come back to Lightspeed or Highland for funding after they get their degree.<p>Highland also funds biotech and provides lab space in their incubator. Neither one is targeting the same uber-hacker that YC prefers.<p>I think you should be flattered you began this trend of micro-investment. It's a great idea. I'm grateful because it's better for all us young entrepreneurs to have as many options as possible.",1176104007

10681,comment,10132,10132,0,0,BrandonM,,,"""In most cases, though, it's better to work with people's illogical expectations.... Perhaps that's why Lisp never caught on.""<p>I appreciate the insight here.  I think that if the goal is to create a general-purpose programming language for consumption by the average population, it might be better to meet the expectations of the average person.  I'm not saying that it needs to be C-like necessarily, but I think that you're right that things like order of operations and other expectations should probably be properly preserved, at least for mathematical operations.<p>I also realized that my approach was still wrong.  If the goal is to be able to build <i>any</i> programming language, the left-to-right approach would already be limited to building a language which evaluates from left-to-right.  So it seems that I still have work to do in order to figure out how best to design a language which is able to look like whatever the user desires it to.<p>One possibility is to sacrifice ease of macro-writing for making other areas of the language more consistent (but not Lisp-like).  That is, I would like to keep the expressive power of macros high (even if it involves modifying the read table in some way) while keeping the language intuitive for a beginner.  This would likely make it a bit more difficult to write macros, but by the time you are using macros a lot, you are probably a bit more advanced, anyways.<p>I'm thinking that there has to be some kind of grammar theory that I can leverage here, where the programmer could actually modify the language's parser in the program while maintaining consistency and lack of ambiguity, or being alerted to the potential ambiguity in case they fail to.<p>In any case, I am quite convinced that Lisp is probably one of the most ideal languages.  This means that my hypothetical language may be an example of the phenomenon pg describes, where the best languages are those which are designed for use by the designer, and languages like Java and Cobol are the result of designing for others.  I would like to hope that's not the case here, since I'm approaching this with a use-case in mind: to design a language which can be used to design any other language.",1176103125

10675,comment,10171,10379,0,0,jward,,,"I'd like to make a difference in the world, and have enough money.<p>I first started hawking things to old ladies when I was six.  Both my parents have owned several businesses over the years.  Finance, law, and business have always fascinated me.  Aside from a brief stint where I wanted to be an astronaut, every single ideal future I've seen for myself has had me working for myself.<p>I also really don't like 'working'.  I like being in control of my own destiny, having a boss isn't good for that.  I like feeling useful, most jobs I've had I didn't get that feeling.  I want to be exemplary, but doing tech support made me feel mediocre at best.<p>As for web startups, it's a simple matter of math.  I can't be passionate about something I don't care about and it costs less to start a startup than a restaurant.  I'm not a genius by any stretch, and reading about some of the people who have been picked for YC... I'm a little in awe.  But I do get computers and coding very well.  It's something I know how to do and is hard enough to be challenging.<p>I want it for the freedom, the challenge, and a chance to make a difference in the world.  A pile of cash would be a nice bonus, but isn't needed.  Just as long as I have enough to live comfortably.",1176102127

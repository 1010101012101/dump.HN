On the surface this might seem like bad odds but we are talking about businesses that have the potential over a life time to be worth over 10million dollars.\nAnd so the expected value of starting one is 0.1 * 10million = 1million.\nThese figures are arbitary but it's more to illustrate the point that they aren't that insane to start one.\nThe thing about entrepreneurship is that if you fail you can always try again.  Try 12 times and that puts your probability of success to 70%. Assuming the trials are independent, but they are not most entrepreneurs will succeed in 4 tries.",1271779198

1279741,comment,1279290,1279290,0,0,cobralibre,,,"I like D.A.'s answer, but to be fair, there are certain contexts in which questions of this sort are not assumed trivial.  I'm thinking specifically of Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>; there's every indication that the author thought through every last detail of his fictional Dublin. The book demands that the reader negotiate her way through a thicket of of raw <i>facts</i>, and it has produced mountains of scholarship on seeming trifles, not all of it in the service of deep profundity, but some it quite startling in its cleverness and insight.<p>If my experience of growing up with <i>Star Wars</i> and reading about fans' notions of canonicity is any indicator, I'd expect that readers of SF and fantasy often have similar expectations of total world-building on the author's part, for better or for worse.  There are thousands of ""facts"" which <i>Star Wars</i> fans ""know"" about the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, though that universe is not real, and none of those facts appear in the movies.  (Sometimes those ""facts"" sprang into being to suit Kenner's needs.)  Which is to say that, contra Adams, fictional worlds -- though not <i>real</i> -- often do have a sort of reality that extends beyond the author's primary text.<p>(The difference between my <i>Star Wars</i> example and <i>Ulysses</i>, though, is that the <i>Ulysses</i> ""facts"" are literally <i>in</i> the text or are inferred from it.)",1271778925

It was pretty much a phenomena of the turbulent cultural '60s (which didn't quite start in 1960), which is not surprising for a whole bunch of reasons, e.g. I'm pretty sure MIT decided to make itself a bit less difficult to succeed in (e.g. when I attended in 1979-80, the entire freshman year was pass/fail, now it's only the first term, and I'm sure before the '60s they didn't do this).<p>Oh, that rule of thumb predicts 3.00, while MIT including the freshmen is 3.17.

For a positive one, they wrote (paraphrasing) ""economists have long recognized that certain professions, such as science and engineering, produce benefits to society that greatly exceed the immediate rewards that the practitioners are able to recoup...""<p>So it really is a question of degree.  The people who did the original research that led to the creation of the internet or decoding the genome have contributed vastly more  to the general wealth than people who lobby for the extension of copyrights that were set to expire (who probably profit personally but destroy wealth), but I bet they earned a lot less.  I'm not opposed to a government that provides incentives through grants to the researchers.<p>Unless you're an extremist, the principles are the same, it's just where you draw the line.  I'd call myself a moderate fiscal conservative - in general, I'd prefer market solutions, but I'm not a small government zealot.  P<p>One quick thing about public health care - I got an interesting perspective from a physician who worked in an emergency room.  He said that people who are broke and have no health care still get their health care paid for by the taxpayer.  They just wait until problems become so awful that they have to crowd the emergency room, where treatment is at its most expensive.  They're on the hook for the money, but you can't get blood out of a turnip, so the hospital is never reimbursed, and private emergency rooms transfer the patient to the county (taxpayer supported) hospital asap.  Unless you're prepared to deny people with extremely bad health conditions access to the emergency room, you, as the taxpayer, are going to pay for the ""emergency room public health clinic"".  So would you rather pay early, when it's cheap, or later, when it's extremely expensive?",1271778593

It gives statistics but does not cite the source of the statistics.<p>The paper you cited contains statements like this:<p>""Increases in net tuition have significantly, but not completely replaced the decline in state support per student \nfrom 2001 to 2005. In 2001 total revenue per FTE was $10,100 in 2005 dollars, essentially an all time high. It dropped 8.8% to $9,212 by 2005. While this is a material decrease from the high point in 2001, it is roughly the level of funding available in the early 1990s.  ""<p>The author thinks that since the funding per FTE student in 2005 is roughly the same as in the early 90's there has been no decline.  This is an astoundingly bad conclusion.  There is a thing called inflation.  There is no reason to believe that since $9,000 per student was spent in the early 90s then this same amount ought to be adequate in 2005.<p>The author also writes:<p>""This amounted to about $10,000 per FTE student in financial aid, half grants and half loans and work study.""<p>See, he counts as part of his funding per student debt that the student acquires in order to attend school.  When a student acquires debt to pay for his/her tuition then this can't be counted as part of government funding for higher education.  The only part of this debt that can be counted is the reduced cost in interest payments due to any federal guarantees of such loans.<p>In another place the author writes:<p>""The State Higher Education Finance study, done annually by SHEEO, shows “net tuition” (tuition revenues less waivers and student aid from state and institutional sources) has grown from 22% of total expenditures in 1981, to 26% in 1991, to 37% in 2005.

Individuals. Obviously, if individuals are better off then society will automatically be better off. Isn't it?<p>So if you think by providing education to an individual, society becomes better, why don't we provide good healthy food for all the individuals and we will solve the obesity problem and end up with a really healthy society? How about providing free access to a high quality gym and personal instructor? I see that you are disagreeing and you would say, one has to draw line somewhere. And in my opinion, if you think that Government should be not be responsible for good healthy food (the most important thing for an individual, even more than education), I don't understand how you can say that Government should provide public education.<p><i></i>EDIT 2:<i></i><p>And here's why I am not in favor of government programs. A bureaucrat has no incentive what so ever to please their customers (i.e. taxpayers). [Quick, tell me, how many government agencies do a good job in your opinion?] By nature, government will try to find a one-size-fits-all solution to education, which does not work.

I'll leave the universal healthcare thing alone, since it delves into an argument that has merits on both sides and I don't have any radically different arguments that people haven't heard, except that I think the artificially high licensing requirements for doctors and restrictions on supply via medical schools are driving up costs and that's a bad thing. But beyond that, you've probably heard all of my beliefs on universal healthcare elsewhere and I have nothing new to add, and will refrain from reposting them. Both sides have some merit.<p>But I have, I think, views that most people haven't heard or thought of about public education.  I've been thinking on this lately since I read a submission here where a teacher of the year was complaining about what a mess the school system is and how it kills creativity and fosters obediance. (I searched for the post to link it, it was +120 or so and very well received, but I couldn't find it - if anyone has a link for people who missed it, it was a very good piece)<p>Me? It may seem somewhat radical at first, but I think top-down, streamlined public education is a mess, a disaster, and makes people less fit to be adults and citizens. It makes them reliant on following instructions and higher authority that provide clear and precise instructions and evaluate on clear and precise guidelines, and kills innovation and creativity. Like some other bright students, I'd often try to speak to my teacher and say - hey, I'm not really interested in this lesson, can I do this more difficult and more stimulating thing instead? Far more often than not, the teacher said no. In the real world, if you go to head of R&D or operations or logistics with credible specs that show you can make a lot more money for the company doing something better and ask to work on it on a trial basis, you'll get greenlighted. If not, you can throw your hat in at a startup or start a company yourself. That's real life. The educational system isn't for that though.<p>It grades from 0 to 100. But in real life, it's okay to be terrible at, say, ""social studies"" and score a 0 on it while scoring 1,000,000 in an applied science like engineering. If you're a failure of a historian and can't remember dates and places to save your life, but you can make a better engine, you're in line for quite a good life. But the potpourri-based education system, with its dabbing here and there on a curriculum set by other people - it'll have none of that. You'll get an ""A"" in math, an ""A"" in physics, and an ""F"" in social studies, and wind up with a 2.6 GPA and be in bad shape academically.<p>I dropped out of two high schools and one university, and I think it was the best thing in the world for me. But I <i>love</i> learning, and I <i>love</i> good education. I've self taught myself a number of things, and learned from smarter people. But never mind me, the education system stifles creativity and curiosity among high performers, but most land on their feet. What about the people who aren't succeeding?<p>And I'll tell you - I've met some people who failed out of school but were quite talented, and it's a function of how the school system is drawn up. There's lots of new cool things coming out of home schooling, and one of the biggest findings is that people really shouldn't be studying a subject based on how old they are; they should be studying based on where they're at in their development. It's okay if this particular 8 year old isn't interested in reading nonfiction but is already doing algebra, and this particular 8 year old is still a bit rudimentary in mathematics but is reading deeply into classical works. You meet the student where he or she is at and everyone develops at a bit of a different pace.<p>And this is why I'll go so far as to say that I think the school system is destructive to young minds. It's because it chokes out potential competition from different systems. When I was speaking on the phone to a friend of mine about how hard it is to build alternative schooling projects, he said, ""Yeah, it's hard to compete with free."" But you know what? It's not hard to compete with free. You just need to provide better features and support than the free option, and some people will choose it.<p>No, it's much worse than that. The school system isn't free.  You're not competing with free. You're competing with, ""You've already been forced to pay for this."" Anyone who wants their kid to be educated differently has to pay for their kid's education twice - first through taxes, and second through tuition. This means that private education is largely for the wealthy, and low priced private education options can't compete. Poor people can't afford to turn down the already-paid-for-education. Knowing that poor people will be choosing the already-paid-for option, very few people are trying to make low cost options that would work well for the poor.<p>I got into university despite not finishing high school, I learned quite a bit in my law, technology, and business classes, but I didn't finish because I couldn't deal with how university math was taught. I was already working on important stuff in my life, actually using real math, and I couldn't get my mind around the piles of homework of mindless nonsense.<p>Statistics class killed me. I couldn't deal with it. But I'm now a lover of statistics, and you know how I learned? Baseball. Comparing on base percentage, slugging percentage, trying to figure out what the optimum mix and lineup balance is, looking for baseball skills undervalued by market, looking for weird park effects where a player strikes out a lot at their home park for god-knows-why and might do better at a park that for whatever reason has lower strikeouts. You can find all kinds of cool things out diving around in statistics. For the real baseball nut, you can look at what percentage of different pitches a player swings at, and his contact percentages on each pitch - really fun and interesting stuff.<p>But as far as I know, there's none or not many classes teaching math by using sports, which is something a lot of kids like and are stimulated by. I played poker with a guy who couldn't do school math at all, but had a loose grasp of poker odds and amazing knowledge about basketball. We used to debate whether Allen Iverson's low shooting percentage high volume scoring was good for his team or not.<p>A lot of kids could learn math that way. You see kids who can't handle memorizing names and dates, are bored, not stimulated - but they can quote all kinds of stats about their favorite sports players and debate whether the higher batting average/lower power player like Ichiro Suzuki is better, or the lower average/more power guy like Carlos Pena is better.<p>But the top down, government run school system chokes that out. And that's before we even start talking about topics like history, which might as well be called ""Patriotic Indoctrination Courses"". The wars that we spent the most time on in history class were The American Revolution, The War of 1812, The American Civil War, and World War II. And we can get the ""we're the clear good guys"" side of the story, nothing about supplying Stalin and what Stalin did to the captured Japanese prisoners in Manchuria after the war was basically already over. Nothing about the firebombing of Dresden, very little about the fire raids on Tokyo. Then we get a little bit of ""well, we were sort of the bad guys in the Indian Wars and Vietnam"", and then we get not much treatment at all of World War I (we're the neutral to slightly bad guys in that one - why were we even in the middle of a European colonial war?), the Spanish-American War (the Americans of the day were waaaaay the bad guys in that one), the Mexican American War (questionable - somewhat bad in that one), or all the little invasions and overthrows of little republics there and there.<p>And I see this everywhere. I'm in China right now - and at the risk of upsetting the internet censors here, they ain't get so much a fair view of recent history. But my girlfriend is Taiwanese and says Taiwanese history vis-a-vis the Kuomintang and corruption and recent history is totally unreliable and ridiculous too.<p>I think central education chokes out better options, stifles creativity, fosters obediance, and has no chance at providing anything like a fair view of history. I think it made sense during the Industrial Revolution, where centralizing education meant a base standard of literacy and mathematics ability among the population, and central education might make sense in a developing country. But I think once you hit a certain point of wealth, then private education and tutors can take over.<p>People talk about how private education doesn't serve the poor - but I think that ignores the historical record. People have shown as much or more willingness to volunteer to teach than to volunteer for almost any other cause in history. And options designed to meet the student where he is at, to meet him at a point of interest, to build a curriculum for him - those options aren't built for poorer people once already-been-paid-for education is offered. The wealthier do alright under public education by opting out of it except in the best districts, but I think the poor suffer quite a lot by centrally planned education not meeting them where they're really at. I think it's not good for anyone, not the poor, the middle class, or the wealthy, and I think if we can realize this and dismantle centralized education, we'll see huge gains in creativity, persistence, personal responsibility, and prosperity.",1271776725

To say it another way, the more selective an institution is the higher the GPAs. ie. If you get smarter students, they tend to have higher GPAs. Example my econ professor has been looking at the actual distribution of performance in his class. He does not find a bell curve. Additionally he asserts there is no reason to expect a bell curve in a college course, as students tend take courses they are both interested in, and good at. The consequence, since you don't have an even distribution of stupid students to smart students, you won't have an even distribution of grades.",1271776093

No, apparently he's not.<p>That's not really fair - there are plenty of very good motivations for writing (and reading) fiction other than immersion in a sustained imaginative world.

1279575,comment,1279396,1279396,0,0,tseabrooks,,,"When I was a grad student, 2 years ago, I was the teaching assistant for Operating Systems. I was responsible for all the grading in the class and the professor told me to give everyone A's no matter what on the assignments and quizzes. Most of the students had little to no understanding of the material. The professor said he was up for tenure that year and he was afraid that if we handed out bad grades the students poor evaluations of him would keep him from getting tenure.<p>I wonder if universities put to much stock in the opinions of the students. I'd imagine that the professors eveluations would be heavily skewed towards the negative if they grade their students performance accurately. I'd expect, if grades were some how a normal distribution which they probably weren't, that the students doing poorly in the class would give the prof low marks and the students doing well would give the prof <i>meaningful</i> marks - some percentage of which would be negative.",1271775762

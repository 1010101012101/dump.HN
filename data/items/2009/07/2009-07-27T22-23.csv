There was no GPS.
There was no SDK or store (""Just write web apps!"")
Built-in apps like Maps lacked fundamental features like placemarks.
Other core features like landscape keyboards were arbitrarily unavailable in many apps.
You couldn't listen to the iPod on Bluetooth headsets.
You couldn't record video.
The SDK, when it did arrive, came with an obnoxious NDA that kept developers from being able to talk to each other.
There's probably a few dozen other points I could make.<p>Basically, while I think Apple's SDK licensing requirements and the App Store's approval process are both giant, poorly-thought-out clusterfucks, I have no reason to think their worst shortcomings won't be fixed.  My iPhone has received better post-sale support -- for <i>free</i> -- than any other device or software package I've owned.  So I'm slow to add my own voice to those of the complaining masses.<p>Give it a year.  If there are still arbitrary goofy rules about no ""frameworks"" being allowed, and if apps from everybody from Trent Reznor to Google to Joe Nobody are still subject to the approval whims of some random anonymous minimum-wage outsourced troglodyte, then I'll agree that Apple has taken their eye off the ball.

When I'm in non-costal parts of the US, I spend a lot of time researching what other people are doing with their computers.<p>It's been enlightening: Most people use XP or Vista.  Apple is for rich people or designers.  Facebook is the hot new hotness.  No one has heard of twitter except if they watch CNN.  Smart phones are for the rich or business types (they use blackberries).  Everyone loves their iPods.  No one gets twitter.  Even among non-SV geeks, using Python or Ruby is pretty rare, and no one has heard of EC2, although they vaguely know about ""cloud computing"" and virtualization.<p>The problem that Andrew brings up is very real, but there's an easy solution to the problem: get out of town and visit family for a while.",1248732836

I suppose it's an improvement that the explanation made to fit ""just so"" fits with a vaguely scientific worldview rather than consulting the bones, tea leaves, tarot, or astrological charts.

A rice cooker makes the process dramatically less error prone, and the resulting rice is better: fluffier, more consistently cooked, etc.  A girlfriend bought me a fuzzy logic rice cooker (about $150, I think) a few years back.  Best kitchen device <i>ever</i>.  It cooks brown rice, oatmeal, etc. in addition to white rice, and it gets it right every single time.  The pan also has measurement marks inside so I don't even have to measure the water.<p>The big problem with a pot is that you'll often get the temperature wrong, and end up baking the lower layer of rice onto the pot bottom, or not quite cooking it fast enough and end up with mushy rice.  I only get great rice from a pot about 75% of the time.  It's 100% of the time with a rice cooker.<p>So, yes, not having to pay attention to the rice while I work on other parts of the meal is a huge bonus.  If you only need white rice, you can get a basic rice cooker that will work very well for about $25 (I've heard brown rice is possible with the lower priced devices by giving it a bit more water, and leaving it to ""warm"" for a few extra minutes, but I've never tried it).",1248732078

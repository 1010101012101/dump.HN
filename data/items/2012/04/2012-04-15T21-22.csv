3844907,comment,3844266,3844266,19,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Some incidental writerly advice: Avoid using the word <i>cancer</i> metaphorically, unless you're deliberately trying to parody the writing style of, say, Adolf Hitler. Otherwise it's like trying to use a howitzer to dig postholes in your yard.<p>I first began to notice the dangerous power of this word when I was working in cancer research. To a cancer researcher, cancer is a thing one deals with all day long, but at a very safe emotional distance. You're used to cancer cells; you study them all the time. You spend quite a lot of time carefully raising them in dishes. You give excited talks about how they work. Still, it's hard not to notice that when you tell a stranger on the street what your research is about, there's this little intake of breath.<p>And then I grew a bit older, and some friends and I lost relatives to cancer, so we got the chance to actually experience the process from the patient's point of view. (An opportunity which, fortunately, many young people don't get.) And I gradually realized, at a gut level, what all the fuss was about: Cancer is <i>really</i> awful. Dying of it is awful, and not dying of it is also pretty damned awful, because the treatments are painful, often damaging, often disfiguring, and <i>dreadfully uncertain</i>.<p>Don't use the word unless you mean it. And you probably don't mean it.",1334527145

That freedom isn't being granted wholesale as required, it's being metered by Apple. They can take it away at any time if they want to, because in order to run the program your device MUST contact them and retrieve decryption keys specific to that app and that account holder. That's not freedom, its permission on a fine-grained basis<p>> The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).<p>Releasing the source MAYBE complies with this, changing the program tends to require the code anyway, but its a grey area to me. Have I actually enabled recipients to change it if they can't run that code without Apple's permission? I guess, in a way, but it's a bad deal for them for technical reasons<p>> The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).<p>Sure <i>I</i> can hand out binary copies if I want (that can't run anywhere but jailbroken or preauthorized devices during beta testing), but someone receiving a copy through the App Store can't. The program is encrypted and can only be decrypted with a key held by Apple<p>> The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3)<p>Same deal as previous point to some degree, they can modify the code, but then what?

And maybe he is.  Of course, that doesn't make him wrong, and it doesn't mean that he's ""retarding the future"" either, necessarily.<p>But the fact that jsmin is perhaps the most widely deployed JS minification utility does matter, whether anyone chooses to accept it or not.<p>And if you really think that he is retarding the future, the correct answer probably isn't to bicker about it on the internet, but to create a better compiler (or work on getting a better compiler accepted) as de facto.<p>At the end of the day though, Fat is the guy who has to deal with all the tickets talking about 'This doesn't compile in jsmin', and I'd think his life would ultimately be better off if he just added a semi-colon.<p>Of course, that's my opinion only, so take it for what it's worth.",1334526712

But many of the behaviors we exhibit are completely natural to us and difficult to change.  For example, we check our e-mail on what psychologists refer to as a <i>variable interval reinforcement schedule</i>; we know that at approximately some interval we get an e-mail that is helpful or enjoyable to us, and we waste our time checking for that e-mail.<p>It's hard to change the e-mail we receive on a global scale in one instant.  It's quite a lot easier to develop tools that change how the e-mail we receive is displayed to us.  One such concept was the Gmail priority inbox: what if you only got notifications for the e-mail that was important and could buffer up the rest for later?<p>A complete theory of how e-mail could work might easily involve a hybrid approach.

Awesome right?<p>Using libOrange and an XMPP framework (both objc, really easy to use), I got the core functionality to work, then turned my attention to OTR. After I nailed down some of the tricky parts of wrangling a non-threadsafe C library, I was ecstatic. It worked!<p>The first time I watched an OTR session establish while talking to a friend over AIM from my iPhone was so rewarding :)<p>And then I realized one day, that while I was perfectly aware of the licensing terms on libotr and its dependencies (all LGPL or GPL), at the time I didn't realize they were blatantly in conflict with the app store in more ways that one.<p>For starters, Apple applies a EULA that, to my knowledge is still incompatible with the GPL. Binaries are also encrypted, and signed, and prevented from running on devices owned by someone who isn't the original buyer. Even if that person chose to exercise their rights under the GPL to redistribute the program, they can't because nobody else can run it.<p>I planned to BSD-license the whole project from the start, but it wouldn't have changed anything. I'd still be violating the terms (or inducing Apple to violate the terms) on more than one GPL licensed library, each with multiple original authors who could, should they feel inclined, have the entire thing removed from the store (which I believe is what happened with VLC, no?). Or, Apple could simply decide to yank it. Not something I wanted to have happen after spending loads of time on custom interface code, making everything play nice, etc.<p>Some time later, I noticed someone else started a similar project (ChatSecure) and actually put it up on the App Store, apparently undeterred by the licensing issues. The code is open and on Github, and maybe thats enough to satisfy all the copyright holders on the GPL stuff (if they're even aware) but Apple could still yank it.<p>I don't like having to make choices like this, I love working on iOS and I also have no problem with the GPL, but I have to actively avoid one when working with the other :(",1334524794

I would venture a guess that you're wrong about it being dated.<p>2) It has recently been updated...  Objective-C 2.0 has features such as Garbage Collection and ARC to make memory management easy.  If your conceptualization of a ""modern"" language is C++ or Java, please think again.   ""Modern"" languages are moving towards flexibility and loose typing (like in Ruby, ObjC, etc...) not language such as C++ or Java.<p>James Gosling was, indeed, quoted once as citing ObjC as the inspiration for Java.   Many NeXT engineers, in fact, helped to build Java when they went to Sun.<p>3) ObjC's use on other platforms is hardly zero, but it is, nonetheless not very popular on other platforms aside from Mac.   But this is not, as you seem to suggest, because it isn't any good, but because many developers don't know that it's useful on other platforms because they think it's restricted to Mac.<p>So, if any of you would like to help make ObjC more useful, feel free to help the GNUstep project.

1266256,comment,1265327,1265867,0,0,roel_v,,,"First, I never said that actions that are wrong become right because we do them. What I'm saying is that they are perfectly fine for us (or were fine for us in the period we transitioned to a capitalist system), and I do not see why they wouldn't be for these workers (I'm talking about the no phone, keeping finger nails short, searches while leaving factory etc, not the sexual intimidation - see below).<p>Secondly, I can't comment on how much money the guy from the article is making or how much purchasing power that represents. However it does seem that he needs to support not only himself, but also his parents, plus save up for a bride price, a practice itself instigated by years of dysfunctional demographic control policies. I would estimate that only the top 20 or so percentiles of youth in their 20's in the West make enough money to support themselves, their parents AND save up for a significant expense. (I'm not very familiar with the current marriage market in China but I've read that in some areas prices of  $5000 are being paid. That would represent several years worth of (average) salary. How many people in their 20's in the West do YOU know who can save up 150k in a few years?) So all in all the elevated need for income seems to come from externalities. While unfortunate for this worker, and I sympathize with his hardships, I think no reasonable person will argue that he should be paid according to his 'need' (use of vocabulary of a certain flawed economic system intentional)<p>Again, I'm not saying that because 'we' (Westerners) have something that that makes it right; but again in this case, it seems like this guy faces the same challenge that many young people in the West face, and while many of us like to complain (myself included), I would not argue that this is imposing 'inhumane conditions' upon us.<p>Then, about the work safety regulations - fining people for getting hurt is not right. The article does seem though like they had to go out of the way to find an example of such an instance. On top of that, not only the worker was fined, also the management, and the worker was re-hired. Still no excuse for unsafe working conditions, but again if this is the worst example they could find, I'd say they're doing quite OK. We can't really tell from the article if it's really unsafe, and I have a hunch the author would've let us know if he knew just one more way to make it seem like a horrible factory.<p>Lastly, the sexual harassment. For this, too, there is no excuse; on the other hand, it's quite easy for something to be labeled 'sexual harassment' nowadays. The article only says ""Some security guards sexually harass the young women, often using very provocative language."" which seems to suggest that in the most extreme cases, they use ""very provocative language"". Again without details this is hard to judge but it hardly seems to be the daily gang rape that the rest of the article suggests it is.<p>(Let me be clear, for the record, that no form of sexual harassment, in any place or form, is ever OK. However there are gradations of sexual harassment and my point is that from what we can tell from the article, the worst that happens is in the same class of behavior as mild picking on a colleague - not acceptable, but not the worst either, in the broad moral spectrum).<p>So in closing (at last...), my original point still stands. If the facts in the article (of which there are few, in between all the rhetoric) are correct, and if these facts are interpreted in context, even when contrasted with so-called 'advanced nations', there seems to be very little that is out of the ordinary (if not up for some improvement, as is the case anywhere), and certainly not as ""dehumanizing"" or exploitative as the author wants to make us believe.<p>(sorry for the long ramble :) )",1271282105

The alternative to what is currently going on in China isn't a workers' paradise where everyone is happy with a middle class, 40 hour a week job.  The alternative is a nation starving (Mao?).  I think your view discounts the rubble that China has come out of and the place it is today entirely.  I doubt many Chinese feel their parents were better of than they are.<p>As for prostitution, if the family doesn't need the money to eat and survive that is one thing, and actually based on the economic specifics going on there I don't actually think it's relevant.  If they are selling their daughter for hunger/survival, well it really sucks but we with cushy lives forget that survival is actually the most important thing.

1266230,comment,1265327,1266127,0,0,lsc,,,"""Chinese labor is competing and slaughtering the US machines.""<p>Sure, on the things that humans do better than robots, like sewing chumbies.   My understanding is that china imports a whole lot of manufactured parts (computer chips, etc..)  does the final assembly step (the one where humans can compete with machines)  and exports the result.   Some people say that much of our trade imbalance with china should be re-assigned to other countries that sell the chips to china, where they are assembled into a final product and sold to the US.<p>For example, I'm typing this on a Lenovo brand thinkpad;  It was Assembled in China by a Chinese company.<p>But, the CPU is made by intel (and nearly all Intel fabs are in the first world, many of them in the US.)  and the ram and SSD is made in Korea.  The LCD was also made in Korea.  I haven't taken apart the battery assembly (which was assembled in china) but it would not surprise me at all if the Lithium Ion cells and the controller chips were made in Japan.  It seems to me, then, that most of what I paid for my Lenovo was not actually being paid to China;  China was just the cheapest place to aggregate and assemble all the components.<p>As time goes on, there will be more and more things a machine can do better than a human can;  that is why I don't think it's a problem for the US that china has dramatically lower prices for rote labour.  You can't get a high school student to hand-craft a microchip, no matter how hard you work them.<p>The other thing about China is that there is a huge gap between unskilled work and skilled work.  Much larger than here.  I mean, here, there is maybe a 10x-20x (give or take) difference between the hourly rates of our lowest-skilled workers and our highest skilled workers  (I mean, if you discount managers.)  In China, this difference is much greater;  The very skilled workers are paid at almost 1/3-1/2  global parity.   I'm helping a Chinese friend set up a hosting company in China, and he tells me that he's going to need to pay close to the equivalent of USD$40K a year for a good software engineer.   (I mean, someone with a masters or better.)  I mean, that's a lot less than US rates, but it's not pennies.  Hell, It's slightly more than I paid myself last year.",1271281558

Despite being second-class citizens under Japanese rule, the government ran like clockwork; contrast with post-KMT-takeover Taiwan where the government became unfathomably inept and corrupt. This trend did not even begin to reverse itself until legitimate, sizable political opposition began to form against the KMT.<p>Side note: Said opposition (the DPP) turned out to be just as corrupt, if not moreso, than the ones they formed to replace. Thankfully years of pressure from a significant opposition party, and several more of even-more-inept DPP rule has created some saner political choices in Taiwan.<p>> <i>""Taiwan did not need sweatshop labor to pull itself out of poverty.""</i><p>Then what did it need? Imaginary capital investments in our many fine local delicacies? Become a tourism-driven banana republic? Grow fruit for American mega-conglomerate fruit companies? The industrialization of Taiwan generated the necessary economic lift that, to be fair to the KMT, under sound governmental oversight, resulted in the country we see today.<p>I think it's incredibly disingenuous to pin the blame for everything on the Japanese - the KMT fucked up just as much as they got right. If you want to talk about government corruption, nepotism, and downright incompetence, the KMT is a far better example than the Japanese.<p>> <i>""That is highly insulting. It was not because of laziness or stupidity that much of Taiwan was so poor.""</i><p>I'm not sure what I've said that insinuates this... but that's certainly not what I meant.

Converting a lossy format (mp3 or Ogg) to a lossless format (FLAC or WAV) wouldn't recover any of the lost data and would be rather pointless. Converting WAV to FLAC, however, will reduce the original filesize to about 50-60%  of its original size, while still maintaining the exact same audio quality as WAV. Converting FLAC to mp3 or Ogg will reduce the filesize even more but will remove some of the actual audio data (higher bitrates retain more of the original data but still remove some, though typically out of the range of what you'd notice listening to the song). At bitrates like 96kbps or even 128kbps, you'd probably notice a difference in audio quality, whereas with a 256kbps or 320kbps mp3 you probably wouldn't be able to tell much difference between it and the FLAC unless you have excellent hearing or it's being played on high-grade equipment.<p>So:\nFLAC -> mp3  OK\nmp3 -> FLAC Unnecessary",1271280759

My father survived a chlorine tank breach by a hair - a low wall was the only thing between him and certain death.<p>None have regretted working there despite this.

His complaints range for anything from not being allowed cell phones in the factory to terrible food to hot-bunking in the employee dormitories.

However he mischaracterizes one segment of Die Hard that would actually strengthen his thesis.<p>The article argues that the logic of Die Hard rewards those who ""infest"" the spaces they inhabit, traversing them creatively rather than via their intended corridors, elevators, and doorways.<p>He uses the L.A. SWAT team running across Nakatomi Plaza's rose garden as an example of this.<p>I'd counter that the SWAT team's approach was actually conventional.  They try to get in through the front door, and get blown away. Had they tried to tunnel in from below, for example, in Die Hard's world they would have been more successful.<p>Also, his point that the subsequent Die Hard films would have been improved by holding onto the premise of exploring an architectural space rings true.  Die Hard 2 tried to do this with an airport, but it was a much less interesting locale.  You could debate whether or not Die Hard 3 was taking the same approach to NYC or not...<p>If, as he says, Die Hard is more about architecture than characters, I'd argue that the true spiritual sequel to Die Hard is Steven Seagal's Under Siege, aka, ""Die Hard on a boat.""

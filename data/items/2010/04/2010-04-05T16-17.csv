It's OK to confuse a camera with a gun, and shoot before discovering that it really was a weapon the hard way. That shit happens at war.<p>But aiming a severely wounded guy, begging him to take a weapon so he can shoot without permission it's sadistic. That guy is a sadic. Now we can discuss if he was born sadic or just the result of careful training, but it's hard to deny, watching the video and hearing the conversations that  he wanted to shoot, and was having fun, the kind of fun a hunter feels.<p>Of course the US Goverment, the Army, whoever, is to blame because covering the thing up.

I'd argue that it's because a) the extent of the problem was realized and those in power figured they'd let another president deal with it, b) those in power wanted to focus on their own agenda which didn't involve cleaning up the GSEs, or c) both.<p>You're forgetting Bush's bid in 2003 and McCain's bid in 2005.  (The 2005 bill was actually considered in 2006.)  So much for the ""none after"" theory.  (Google ""2005 mccain fannie freddie"")<p>The evidence suggests that neither of the above theories was a major factor, that the driving factor was that every effort to deal with GSEs showed that it was an unwinnable fight.  The populists wanted folks to get mortgages even if they couldn't afford them.<p>FWIW, during their brief tenure in the senate, Senators Obama and Clinton got more money from Fannie and Freddie than the chairmen of the relevant committees.  In fact, their totals (over their entire tenure) were approaching the totals of those chairmen, even though the chairmen had been getting such donations for decades longer.",1270486755

That seems like an enormous number given that about 4,800 US soldiers died in the same time period. At about 250,000 US troops in Iraq, that would imply about 7,200 journalists total in-country, assuming an equal proportion of journalists killed.<p>In fact, there were about 220 ""embedded"" journalists in 2007 [1]. Certainly, there were a lot of journalists not associated with the US Army, but, still, the conclusion seems to be that being a journalist in Iraq is <i>far</i> more dangerous than being an American soldier in Iraq.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/10/AR2008101002934.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10...</a>",1270486491

I clearly saw an RPG and a personal weapon, and to be honest, unless the cameraman was ID'd, I would be 50/50 on that.<p>I don't know the tactical situation, but it looks like they were providing aerial cover for a convoy of some sort, since that's who they keep chatting with. This was quite possibly an ambush in it's very early stages. While disturbing (welcome to war) I don't think that the actions of the crew where unbecoming at that point.<p>I did however have an issue with the destruction of the van.  There were no weapons visible, it was clear that they were collecting bodies for transport/medical attention. Any perceived or real threat to the convoy was at that time neutralized, and there was no need to fire.<p>Doing so clearly violated the Geneva conventions and the US Army's ROE. Both apache crews should be charged with murder, and the authorizing officer should be charged with some lesser charge for not confirming the intended target.",1270486302

Mistakes will happen. War is war, and it is inherently already not particularly moral. We reap the benefits in security, and wish to tear people down when mistakes are inevitably made...

However, this is obvious to me after having read comments about the video, as well as with all the captions in the video explaining what it is we're seeing.  This is a lot information gathered after the incident, when the people on the ground actually got to go in and see that there were no RPG launchers and so on.  So even though I clearly see a telephoto lens, I can't say that the guys in the helicopters could see that.  I have a hard time saying that this is clearly murder.<p>The whole situation seems like a no-win to me.  If they (US Military) don't release the video, they cover their ass in the short run, but when the video gets leaked it makes them look more guilty than perhaps they really were.  But if they had released the video then, you'd still get tons of people proclaiming how horrible this is.<p>Don't get me wrong, this is horrible, but it doesn't seem <i>more</i> horrible than a lot of the stuff that happens over there.

So we obviously know, going in to it, that those are not AK-47's and RPGs. But that fact that they have no idea what they just did, is damning in itself.<p>One could easily presume from watching this video, that we have inculcated a sense of utter callousness for the taking of life, and an inability to distinguish peaceful from threatening activities. The judgement is made in an instant that there are guys with guns, despite the fact that there is no suspicious activity going on. It looks like a lawful public assembly. The presumption is: Iraqi men, milling about an area, some with something slung over their shoulders. Must be insurgents. Kill em. Good job, soldier.<p>Is anyone in doubt that the guys who drove up in the van were unarmed? Did they LOOK like they were trying to shoot back at the helicopter. No. They kept looking at it, wondering if they were next. They were risking their lives trying to save an innocent. And they were killed for it.<p>The most chilling line, after announcing that two children were wounded: ""It serves them right for bringing kids into a battle."" Serves them right? Setting aside the fact that nobody who got shot on that day knew that they were in a battle until the bullets starting raining down, do they truly deserve to have their children shot because they bring them into a battle?<p>I have no doubt that these boys will be haunted by what they did the rest of their lives.

The first part (which is what you are trying to get at) is that the prospect of warfare being conducted through a video-game like interface is scary and feels wrong.  I agree and I get a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach just thinking about it.  Imagine soldiers driving to work in the morning from their homes in the suburbs, putting in a 9-5 day piloting a drone killing insurgents, and then going home to their families in time for dinner.  Very scary.<p>However, the second part is what you miss.  These military personnel are <i>kids</i>.  Kids that we ask to conduct a large scale invasion and then engage in the near-impossible task of nation building.  As Thomas Barnett says, the same 19 year old just can't do it all.  These kids should have been out of Iraq after we captured Saddam.  They aren't psychologically equipped to deal with a country post-invasion. This video is a perfect example of that.  Notice how the kid mistakes a camera for a weapon and is extremely jumpy when he is trying to figure out whether he is being shot at.  He's never been trained to deal with this kind of situation (urban warfare, enemies without uniforms, civilians intermixed with soldiers) and it's criminal we force teenagers make these kinds of decisions every day.<p>All of that said, clearly bad decisions were made in this video.

I obviously don't condone the killing in this movie, but just for a moment think about the young kids who were in that helicopter, doing the shooting and all the shit they have to face now.  Think about all the haters that are going to be calling down evil on them over the internet and news.  Think about how bad they must feel knowing that they killed innocent people when they thought they were killing the enemy.<p>From their point of view they are in a helicopter, scared, and afraid that someone is going to shoot a RPG at them.  You can't seriously expect them to notice the kids or the difference between a camera and a weapon.<p>Sure they jumped the gun, they killed innocent civilians, but it was a product of the environment and training they received.  It happened because America made those kids soldiers and put them in that situation, with a deadly weapon to control.  Don't blame them personally.<p>What does need to be blamed, on the other hand, is the fact that this video was kept secret and that the world was lied to.<p>That is disgusting.",1270484044

But the difference is that Google releasing a browser based platform where the only application is the browser forces them to use the same technology as everyone else to create applications, no one can create native applications for ChromeOS (or everyone can, since ""native"" means ""web based"") -- this is, in fact, good engineering because it means there are no secret APIs that give Google's apps an advantage so the Google employees writing apps are more likely to end up with a good API because they see exactly what non-google employees have to deal with.  In fact, Google gives developers the same technology they use to develop apps, things like HTML5 and GoogleGears, etc.  In contrast, Apple originally told people they couldn't develop native apps because <i>only</i> Apple could release native apps.",1270484008

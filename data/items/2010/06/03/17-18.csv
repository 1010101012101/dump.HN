In other words, has the direction of conversation changed from one where ""hackers"" (those that grok a vast or complete portion of a given system, and can identify and implement a clever tweak) can have vibrant discourse to one where the VC side of the coin has come here to observe, and essentially squash out the dialog in the process? (uncertainty principle involving observation and position)<p>As the hackers post less they become lurkers observing the commentary of the business folks. Eventually, interest is lost in even that. I recognize a VC professional could be redefined, interpreted, or understood as a hacker operating within the domain of the larger business and financial world, so I give them credit for that.",1275587894

1401969,comment,1401414,1401414,0,0,iseff,,,"<i>Except that’s only true because until now, nobody has launched an alternate store that offers web stack applications (WSAs). Maybe that’s because nobody is really building WSAs yet, at least not in numbers large enough to justify building a store to sell them. But then, maybe developers aren’t building WSAs because there’s no central place to sell them. The centralization of stores is at least as attractive to sellers as to shoppers.</i><p>We've done a poor job of raising awareness about this (I promise we're trying to do better), but we've been quietly testing out using our store, AppStoreHQ (<a href=""http://www.appstorehq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appstorehq.com</a>), as a mobile web app store (what Eric calls WSAs). We also promote native iPhone and Android apps. I could go on and on about what we're doing, why it's cool, and how it helps developers, but Eric does a relatively good job of explaining that.<p>Instead, I'll just give you a tidbit of information about how we're _actually_ seeing this work in the wild: In short, it works. I developed -- as the first test app available for purchase on our mobile web app platform -- an app I named fortysquires (<a href=""http://fortysquires.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortysquires.com</a>). Fortysquires is just an HTML5 frontend to foursquare's API. I open sourced it so developers could see just how simple it is to integrate with us (<a href=""http://github.com/iseff/fortysquires"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/iseff/fortysquires</a>).<p>What's amazing about fortysquires is that I really didn't expect to sell more than a few copies. It was built just to be a reference app. Remember, this is a paid ($0.99) app that competes against free, more well-featured native apps for Android, iPhone, and BlackBerry. There's also a mobile web version of foursquare (but it's not HTML5 and doesn't include geolocation, etc, like fortysquires does). I really thought I'd sell maybe two or three copies to developers looking to test out the workflow.<p>Yet, what I'm seeing is that <i>real users</i> are purchasing this app, <i>everyday</i>. Everyday, I sell at least one -- but typically more like 3-4 -- ""copies"" of the app. It's not a gold mine, of course, but it far surpassed my expectations. These are users from all over the world on all sorts of different devices. iPhone usage is >50%, but Android is close to 20%, and Symbian, Windows Mobile, Palm, and Samsung all make the cut. And 50% of visitors are from the US, 25% from western Europe, and the rest is divided between many, many countries like Canada, Australia, Israel, Russia, many Asian countries, Costa Rica, Maldives, Camaroon, Kyrgyzstan, etc. In all, more than 70 different countries have checked out fortysquires!<p>We have a lot of work to be done to build a great platform for mobile web app developers to sell their apps (read: we need to make distribution even better for developers, and the purchasing workflow even more frictionless for users, among many other things), but I think we're well on our way to doing so. Mobile web apps may never compete head-to-head with native apps in certain categories (Games), but I think we're proving that they can compete -- and even win -- when the ability to discover and purchase the apps is easy and the apps are great.",1275587780

Many people hate being told what to do and when to do it, but people have a fundamental desire to work.<p>Here's how to do basic income. Starting with 2010 GDP as a base, 50% of all GDP after that goes into a basic income fund that's distributed to everyone. It starts out small and eventually grows to a point where no one has less than a 1/2*N share. For example, let's say GDP/capita is $40000 in 2010. If it rises 2% to $40800, then $400 goes into the basic income fund.<p>If the result of the basic income is that people become lazy and don't work, the basic income falls or is phased out and we call the experiment a failure.",1275587777

It's easy to imagine veins popping out of his forehead and his face beet-red, but it's actually just a voice for expression, in a ""ha-ha, only serious"" way.<p>One could think of it like heavy metal music.   From the musical output of some bands, one might think they have serious issues, but if you look deeper you might see bright, engaged, and literate folk - perhaps fans of H.P. Lovecraft & Tolkein - adopting exaggerated characters for their own amusement, a little catharsis, and maybe a groupie or two.  While it's not my favorite genre, I don't think anybody in Metallica really feels like a mute, paralyzed paraplegic - I just think somebody liked Johnny Got His Gun.<p>I personally think that the world would be a boring place if the only way to make a point was with your hands folded politely in your lap.  Sure, it's valuable and effective to do so, but to disallow other modes of expression would be like saying that the only legitimate colors to paint with are pastels.<p>I think Zed is hilarious, but I can see how you might not ""get"" him.

Likewise, dalits and buraku can become very wealthy because they're doing work that no one wants to do, but their status as low-class individuals persists.

Of course, there is not one country on earth that has an economic trajectory as high. They are experiencing the largest uplift from abject agrarian subsistence to working- and middle-class job creation in the history of civilization. Obviously they do not have the raw materials within their borders to stem that insatiable hunger for growth, thus their foray into resource-rich Africa (and, btw, directly contributing to the relatively quick rise of the African middle-class, as well).<p>Heck the US during and after WWII was centrally planned, and it caused the largest economic growth the world has ever seen, until China's in the 1990s to now. Actually, one needn't look any further than the Marshall Plan to see that government intervention and fiscal stimulus can propel countries to prosperity worldwide.<p>Without a larger central body taking a macroeconomic view and actually being the ""invisible hand"" that Adam Smith relegated to the self-regulating market, Europe probably would have never recovered from either of the world wars and the US possibly wouldn't have seen the growth it did post-WWII.",1275584798

The analysis there can be complicated, so I won't go into it.<p>Concerning patent validity, a patent is presumed valid; the burden is on the challenger to prove invalidity.  This has to be done claim by claim.<p>The courts have held -- wrongly, in my view, but there you go -- that proof of invalidity requires clear and convincing evidence, not just a preponderance of the evidence.<p>Concerning open-sourcing, kits, etc.:  Someone who intentionally induces infringement by another can be liable for the other person's infringement.

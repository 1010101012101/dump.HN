1982164,comment,1980805,1980805,0,0,mirkules,,,"The feeling you get with XCode is that it slows you down. I'm a java developer by day, iPhone dev by night. Eclipse/Java are _light years_ ahead of XCode/Objective-C. My gripes with XCode include everything from the build process, the awkward debugger, Interface Builder, and all the way down to little minutiae like key bindings that just don't make sense (try selecting a block to indent it, every other IDE in the world uses tab, XCode uses Cmd-] wtf?).<p>Not to mention Objective-C, which, as you allude to with garbage collection, is a far more inferior language than java. There's things like passing undefined messages to objects which only generate warning at compile time, and sometimes those warnings don't appear in XCode -- so when your code doesn't work, you're left scratching your head. And why isn't the + operator overloaded for string concatenation?<p>Finally, Objective-C is a very awkward language to use at the keyboard. Object notation [] in particular slows me down a lot - somehow (at least for me) it's easier to type () than it is to type [].<p>Thanks for the article, now off to download the android SDK!<p>P.S. I'm not saying Java is a very elegant language - far from it - but, in my opinion, it's more elegant than Obj-C.",1291791188

1982150,comment,1981789,1982078,0,0,kls,,,"Yep, that is kind of the untold story in the polarized positions on the subject. There are a lot of large volume purchases who would not exist today had they not relied on pirated software early on. It would be nice if there was a program by the major software vendors that a small company just starting out could get a 2yr grace period on licensing and then pay a small overage when the time was up. The reality for most of the small shops 2 years is going to weed out the ones that could not survive and most that do could cover the cost of licensing by then.<p>I was with a company that did the same and went on to become a very large Adobe product purchaser. Adobe made millions of the fact that this company pirated software to get off the ground. We also had an agreement that we make it right ASAP. I agree that when that is in the charter people become more aware of the tradeoffs because when it comes time to make it right they want that number to be as small as possible.<p>Personally I am torn on the subject, small start-up are using the money to put it into developers pockets and pay the bills, in doing so they can grow to revenues that allow them to purchase the licences. Usually more seats than they would have got up front because the company has now grown. So in the end the software companies are getting revenue that would not have existed in the first place had they not relied on pirated software. On the other hand there are some shops that never plan to make it right and that is just not cool. As with everything in life when you peel back the onion it's never black and white. For me personally, if they had plans to make it right when revenue supports it then I would be cool with it. As well, as a software vendor, I would be cool with a company doing this (I would never put it in writing). If they become profitable everyone wins, if they don't well then the software vendor would have never seen that revenue anyways.",1291790702

But they could probably get by with Paint.NET[1]  on Windows. petercooper mentioned two good mac image editing programs. Inkscape[2] is very capable for vector graphics. Sure Paint.NET and Inkscape aren't as good as photoshop, but people are using them to make amazing art so.<p>coffeenut/Locke1689 mentioned BizSpark, which includes MS expression studio. Really if you're working in a start up using Windows that isn't using BizSpark that's more than just a little odd.<p>I find it a little hard to believe that Keynote and/or Powerpoint are necessary. OO.o Impress[3] works just fine for everything I've ever thrown at it, including shoehorning it into making posters. Even google docs presentations are generally sufficient. But I also don't use the typewriter animation with the sound effect.<p>You mentioned Office, to which I would have two questions. The first being ""Why?"" And the second being ""Why is OO.o inadequate?"" I mean, are you writing .docx files, converting them to .doc, printing them to pdf, zipping them and then mailing them about for documentation? And even if you are, OpenOffice would probably work fine. It works especially well when you set the default to save as .doc/.docx (etc).<p>Finally, if it makes you uncomfortable I think you have to bring it up. Not because it's evil or incompetent or anything, but because it clearly bothers you. If it bothers you, your work output will decrease, you'll hate working, start eating bacon mushroom bacon cheddar bacon burgers for lunch and dinner to make yourself feel better and then have a massive myocardial infarction.

HTTP proxies have long supported a way of establishing a raw TCP connection (though I'm unsure of the details), allowing things like corkscrew for using ssh behind a corporate firewall.  As far as I know, these things use HTTP CONNECT.  It seems there's another approach, HTTP Upgrade (which appears to be for switching to/from encrypted mode), which is used by WebSockets but breaks many proxies to the point of vulnerability to cache poisoning.<p>I suppose if there are enough broken proxies out there that can't handle WebSockets, it's better not to take the blame from all those IE6 corporate types for breaking their Intranets.",1291788349
